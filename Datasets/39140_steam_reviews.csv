You don’t need to fight through ancient technical difficulties for an [i]older[/i] game. You don’t need to be capped to 15fps anymore. You don’t have to have any technical expertise to [i]update[/i] FFVII. All you need is 7th Heaven – The Mod Manager for Final Fantasy VII. 

I want to point both experienced FFVII players and new players alike to the guide section on Steam, where you’ll find “Remaster your FF7 – Essential Modding Guide” created by Fawkes. For my first experience I went with all mods described there, aside from Ninostyle characters (I kept it Vanilla instead) and Echo-S (I didn’t want voices added). All mods recommended are for audio, visual and quality-of-life improvements, so they don’t look to alter the gameplay or experience significantly. 

The pre-rendered backgrounds are now sharp and defined through AI upscaling, the advanced lighting creates shadows around objects and characters, the FPS increases from an abysmal 15 frames to a sensationally higher 60 frames. Battle ambience, footsteps and other soundscapes added. Unified field textures transform 4:3 design to 16:9 widescreen format. Analogue movement. The list goes on and on..

Its a darker feeling game overall. Story and pacing is on point. A classic.

If you want to play it and have it feel modern, get the 7th Heaven mod installed and install HD models, Textures, and if you're okay with okay-ish voice acting, get Echo-S. Thats as close as you're gonna get to anything modern sadly.

DO NOT get the New Threat mod. Aside from bugs, I lost out on a limit break and some materia cause for whatever reason the combat-only version switched some items in the world. The enemies have more HP thus becoming a choir getting into fights. 

If you want difficulty with OG, just dont grind. Its no harder or less harder than previous and next up FF games. The ones that say its easy are the ones who've played it 50 times and grind.

I beat the game as a kid and I remember loving it.  Now that I have played many other games, this one definitely shows some flaws.  But these flaws should be considered in the context of a game that is truly remarkable, not only for it's time, but even today,  I haven't really played the remake yet, so I can't compare the two.

As for the flaws, I found the game to be trivial in difficulty.  At no point did it ever really feel like a struggle.  Which is fine I guess, but as someone who has the amount of experience that I do, it's generally more fun when the game is more challenging.  Beginners might appreciate the relative lack of difficulty, as it enables one to better focus on the story aspects of the game, which are likely what draws people to the series in the first place.

I played in original graphics mode with high resolution and I thought it looked fine.  The transition from 2D to 3D graphics was a little awkward, as there was a brief time when the 2d graphics simply looked better than the newer 3d option.  This game, I think, did a good job of avoiding that; which is to say that it has aged quite well.

Overall, I highly recommend this game to any fan of the Final Fantasy series, and to fans of RPGs in general.  This one has a wonderful story, an excellent gameplay system called Materia that are fun to master and play around with in general.  As of this writing I've obtained a total of 15 master Materia.  It doesn't take an undue amount of time to get your characters to 99 and unlock all the achievements, nor do you have to in order to be able to beat the Ruby and Emerald weapons.  I actually beat Emerald weapon on the first try at 99, with maxed out everything except stats, and realized I absolutely could have had a lot of fun trying to down it with less developed characters.

Having played Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10, and 100% completed 1, 2, 7, and 10, I would rank this one at number 2, behind 10, with 2 coming in 3rd and 1 in 4th.

After a regular gameplay, I strongly recommend trying some of the mods made by the talented community. They bring a refreshing modern side to this game, which I'm pretty sure would get approval and praise from the makers themselves back then, had they not been so limited by the technology at the time.
Look for the 7th heaven Mod manager. It's a great tool that simplifies the modding process. I personally use the following ones in this order inside the loader to avoid conflict. Or just use the auto sorting button in the future if there are any changes 

- Tsunamods SYW V6 60FPS FMV
- 60 30 FPS Gameplay
- NinoStyle Battle Models 
- Tsunamods Avalanche Arisen Battle Textures
- TsunamodsSYWV5 Battle Textures (2nd battle texture mod that covers what 1st doesn't)
- NinoStyle Chibi Field Models OR NinoStyle HD Field Models (up to you which you prefer)
- Tsunamods SYW V5 Field Textures
- Tsunamods SYW V5 Minigame Textures
- Tsunamods SYW V5 Spell Textures

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Final Fantasy VII was a PlayStation game from 1997, made by the Japanese game dev studio Square (also known as SquareSoft). 

This is a re-release of the 1998 PC port developed by Square USA (and published by Eidos), updated for modern versions of Windows. 

One of the first differences you'll notice, if you've played the original version on PlayStation, is that the characters have mouths. Comparison [url=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ys9VwHw3b8TuPnAHqHh8ia-1200-80.png]here.[/url]

Why? [i]""I'm not really sure""[/i] wrote programmer Jay Fong in an email to [url=https://www.pcgamer.com/why-the-hell-do-they-have-mouths-a-final-fantasy-7-pc-retrospective/]PCGamer.[/url]

While Jason Greenberg (the only artist listed in the credits) was quoted as saying:

[i]""Great question. I'm wracking my brain to try to remember. This is not something that we added on the art side since I never changed the model files in any way. I believe I remember that the mouths were just sitting there in the original texture files for the characters. I'm pretty sure the code to drive them was probably there as well, and we just enabled it or something. I wish I could tell you more, but I just don't remember it.""[/i]

Okay then... moving on. Square eventually merged with Enix (a Japanese multimedia corporation), and later Square Enix contracted DotEmu to update the PC version.

Essentially, what they've done here is add support for 1080p (no widescreen or 4K), SecuROM DRM (which has thankfully been removed), a crappy Square Enix launcher that requires a Square Enix account, and cloud saving (but not Steam Cloud, only through the launcher using Square Enix's cloud service).

The frame rates are capped at 60 FPS for menus, 30 FPS in the field, and 15 FPS for battles (including the battle UI).

The character booster only works via their website (requiring cloud saving to be enabled), and applies to all characters in your party on a specific save file. It will increase their HP to 9999, their MP to 999, and give the party 49999999 Gil. However, it doesn't affect character level (or any other stats), so it doesn't reduce the need to grind for levels.

The cloud saving feature is also known to have issues, and complications may result in save files being lost.

Final Fantasy VII is one of my favorite JRPGs, but this port is awful. They didn't even include features that the Japanese PC port had, such as high speed mode, no random encounters mode, and a max stats command.",1691919088,1708144980,False,24,0,0.693049192428588867,0,True,False,False

On the plus side of course if you want a work around then you can always use the 7th Heaven mod launcher and bypass the Bulls##t sign up requirement.

Characters are pretty cool and distinctive, they don’t say much, but by the end of the game you feel like you have known them for a while.

Presentation is great, low poly models add to that old game charm which is endearing. Great backgrounds, you can see that a lot of work went into producing them.

Tsunamods update the game, adding modern features and options, updated potraits, models, animations, textures, game play, etc.

Echo 7 S is a community funded voice acted mod. Lots of professional voice actors for main cast, lots of community voices for side NPCS. 

7th Heaven is a mod manager which will allow you to download all these mods. Some mods may interfere, even Tsunamods, just disable to problematic ones.

After your time with FF7 has come to a close, you will want to look into other media such as Advent Children, Crisis Core and the other spinoff material. You will want to dive deeper into the lore and mindset of the world and it's characters. Hooked for life and single handedly responsible for my love of turn-based RPG's aside from Pokemon.

I remember borrowing my friends copy at one time and I could not believe what I was seeing and playing, ""do games like this exist?"", it opened up another world for me.

So I became a paperboy, I saved quarters and cents did chores for months and months and months, hoping to finally, some day, be able to buy a playstation and a copy of the game...

Suddenly one day the money was gone...my parents were addicts and spendthrifts deluxe...so they used the money I had saved and worked for...

But anyway, later down the line, some years later my grandmother actually managed to buy me a Playstation, a copy of Final Fantasy VII AND a memory card, I guess the clerk expressly expressed that this was a very important addition to the whole package...she came through so hard.

She took me aside after I had opened the present, still in disbelief, and whispered ""there's memory on it"", with a warm smile and a glint in her eyes, ""The clerk told me to tell you, there's memory on it"". <3

I love her so much.

And she made my day and years, and it wouldn't be the last time. Bless the woman. Without this game, I would have had a much tougher time growing up on the spectrum, undiagnosed, with parents that only did drugs and never payed any bills at all, and they never even spoke to me, asked me how my day was, if I was alright in school and such...

But Cloud and Tifa and Nanaki spoke to me, they were my friends. And this game is a game I will continue to come back to until I die. Nostalgia has a lot to do with it, perhaps, but mostly it's the themes, the world concept, the music and...everything else. This game is golden, not as golden as my grandmother, but close.

Fans of the genre: Final Fantasy VII is exactly what you're looking for. It's got a meaty, epic storyline that starts small, expands to a global scale, and culminates in an awesome and satisfying finale; a charismatic cast of characters hounded by an unforgettable villain shrouded in mystery; an attractive overworld map littered with secrets, just large enough to convey its sense of scale without feeling unwieldy or overwhelming; a peerless soundtrack, etc. etc. Secret party members, plenty of unlockable weapons and abilities, sidequests...there's just a ton of content here, none of it feels phoned in, and it's all remarkably well-packaged and well-paced.

Final Fantasy VII employs the well-tested fusional real-time/turn-based combat style that the series had neatly settled into by this point. The materia system is, refreshingly, as shallow or as complex as you want it to be. For folks who enjoy farming enemies to unlock massively powerful combinations of spells and passive perks, the ceiling here is quite high - and the game includes optional extreme-difficulty endgame bosses as a reward those who have labored to create truly broken party compositions.

Final Fantasy VII isn't my favorite entry in the series, though it's probably in my top 5 - and it absolutely deserves the praise that it pretty much universally receives. This game is an easy recommend for anyone who is curious about the genre (although at this point I might just advise newcomers to play the Remake instead, as it's way more accessible).

As an aside, I played both Legend of Dragoon and Xenogears prior to picking up this title for the first time a few years ago, and honestly I was surprised by just how much they all ended up resembling each other. Anyone who enjoys JRPGs might want to check those out as well; if I'm being honest, I actually found all three to be of comparable quality (barring the final disc of Xenogears, where the development studio famously ran out of funds), and I've really cherished my time with each.",1622932465,1706833694,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

A complex and epic story about freedom fighters against the evil Shinra corporation along with a struggle against the bio-engineered Sephiroth in a unique and interesting setting.

Graphics: 7  No game as old that I can think of holds up nearly as well as Final Fantasy 7 in terms of graphics, and it was revolutionary for how it looked at the time, both in its own series as well as in gaming as a whole. The backgrounds when not on the world map are of course the biggest highlight of the game, but many of the enemy designs are great, too. Of course, by modern standards the graphics are definitely not able to compete. 

Gameplay: 7 The gameplay in FF7 is surprisingly enjoyable for such an old game, and there's lots of little mini-games that you can play too which add even more to the game's diversity. That being said, there are often times you just want to the random encounters to end so you can get to the next story beat or boss battle.  Also some of your special animations as well as the boss's special animations take FOREVER to finish.

Music: 10 The greatest soundtrack of all time? It's definitely not easy to beat. From the heart-wrenching to the heart-poundiing, there are so many incredible songs in Final Fantasy 7 it's pretty ridiculous.

Well, I'm a wack noob who knows nothing about FF, because VII was my first. I had never even heard of HP or MP or random battles before 1997. I only asked for the game for Christmas because at K-Mart I saw the game said '4 discs' on the package. I didn't even have a PSX yet, and I think I had only played Tomb Raider at that point. But FFVII was there with that gigantic buster sword and four discs, while the trash all around it had only one single disc. Pathetic.

Parents and grandparents went halfsies on a PSX and FFVII for Christmas '97 or '98 (can't remember), and they even got me an ASCII second controller. But none of us knew a memory card was also required. So I replayed the first hours of the game over and over for a week until I had bugged my dad enough to fork the cash out for one (he was pretty thrifty and initially I almost shat my pants when I saw that they had ACTUALLY even got a console for me). A few weeks later I saw the official strategy guide at Blockbuster and begged for that too. In some strange twist of fate, he actually got that for me too after a while.

So I played the hell outta of the game all through 7th and 8th grade. Some of my friends and other kids in school did too. Life was good. I remember beating Emerald WEAPON the first time and calling my best friend who lived across the street to tell him (he came right over to verify). Some amount of time later, that same friend was in my living room during another strange occasion where my mom actually let me hook my game to the TV in the living room. And they sat there with me for all of the like 2.5 hours or whatever it took to beat Ruby WEAPON by miming Bahamut Zero over and over. I remember we all jumped for joy when I saw that red wire-frame and heard that whoosh sound.

I've played Final Fantasy VII through on all the devices I've owned it on through the years, and I have to admit: I don't enjoy the game much anymore. I think it's because I'm still chasing that middle school high I got back then. And as I got older, I started analyzing things more and I see why my young mind was so enthusiastic about this game, and made inferences about why my older mind would've never like this game if I was 39 in 1997.

So play it for the first time, play it again, love it, hate it, mod it.... just don't downplay it's significance.",1706484579,1706484818,True,156,10,0.886768460273742676,2,True,False,False

I played it when I was in junior high and it was the most fun I have ever had playing an RPG. Everything about this game was monumental. The graphics, the scope, the music, the plot, game play mechanics - everything was so next level my young mind was blown. I played it on the Playstation so I was able to enjoy the truly monumental OST that's just as good as the game. I had beat the game maybe three times on the playstation and until recently it was firmly part of my past. 

I always wanted to replay it in a modern sense but it's just ridiculously dated I didn't want to tarnish the memory. The new remake came out and it deviates from the story significantly and adds so much fluff to pad out a single game into three full games so I decided to not play it. Still, I wanted me some FF VII. The other day I read about a mod called COSMOS which upscales all of the background and world graphics while adding in extra art to make it truly widescreen. I thought I would just check it out for maybe 30 minutes and that would be that. 

Well, I found 7th Heaven while looking into getting the COSMOS mods to work and it made it so ridiculously easy to download and configure a bunch of mods which now is giving me that remaster experience I have always wanted. I really feel like the modding community for FF VII is one of the most dedicated communities and I am enjoying the fruits of their labour extensively. So, the graphics and music are all overhauled but also the ridiculous amount of quality of life changes and enhancements are amazing like being able speed up time to not waste your life grinding through battles to level up and get that sweet dosh. I am currently playing with 12 mods. 

Final Fantasy VII modded to hell and back is the definitive experience for me of the game and I am so happy I read that article that took me down this FF VII mod rabbit hole. I am now replaying my favourite game of all time just the way I wished it would be some day. 

Also, The OST remake by FinalFanTim is absolutely phenomenal. 

I am having so much fun it is ridiculous.

She was designed by Tetsuya Nomura with influence from Yoshinori Kitase, Hironobu Sakaguchi and Yoshitaka Amano.

She is one of the main characters of Final Fantasy VII, a young woman allied with the eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE. Over the course of the story, AVALANCHE begin to pursue the game's antagonist Sephiroth, and the player learns that she is the last surviving Cetra, or ""Ancient"", one of the planet's oldest races. She is ultimately murdered by Sephiroth. She has also appeared in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII and Kingdom Hearts series.

She is voiced in Japanese by Maaya Sakamoto. In English, she is voiced by Mandy Moore in Kingdom Hearts, Mena Suvari in Kingdom Hearts II and Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, Andrea Bowen in Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and the Re Mind DLC of Kingdom Hearts III, and Briana White in Final Fantasy VII Remake and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion.

This is the first time I play a FF game ""as-is"", as the previous 6 entries I played are from the Pixel Remaster collection.

This time around, we transition into the 3D era, in a sci-fi fantasy setting as Cloud, a merc hired by some terrorist group called Avalanche. From here on we embark on a peculiar journey that still goes in the save the world direction again, but the approach is wildly different.
This time it feels a lot more character drama centric, much more than the previous entry. Clouds entire backstory, his dynamic with Tifa & Aeris, Barrets & Cait Siths character development; the entire cast is pretty endearing and always developed in a way or another (be it side quest, or main story progression). I really liked this story, it was wild, awesome, relatable, entertaining, endearing and sad all at once, a true roller coaster that I will probably never forget.

My main gripe with the game was mostly the shoddy translation. Specific moments in the game really confused me, and some times the dialogue was super weird, so I dug a bit into it. In my opinion, Tifa & Barret really got done dirty by the translation and sometimes feel like completely different characters, what a shame. It doesn't detract much from the story in the overall grand scheme of things, but it's still a shame to know this, as the ""original character"" was altered. Hopefully this isn't a problem in the Remake.

Gameplay sees yet more changes from the previous entry: the Summon system is gone, relics are also gone and the party size is reduced to 3. Instead of the summon system we get the Materia system. Now each piece of gear can have materia attached to it and each materia adds skills, spells or buffs. Yet another fun mix and match system that encourages experimentation :) anyone in your party could be the tank, or the summoner, or the healer.
Visually the game is really good. In this 3D era instead of pixel backgrounds, we get prerendered backgrounds and instead of sprites we have characters with three dimensional models, made of polygons!
The environments are really impressive and very varied ranging from sci-fi steampunk-y cities to simple fantasy towns, gorgeous nature vistas to whatever the heck the ancient city is. They look really good and set a really nice mood, much more than similar games of the era like Resident Evil which used more or less the same techniques (I believe).
Despite the game being over 25 years old now the low poly models, still have a lot of charm. I initially found them rather cutesy and wonky but with time I got really attached to how they looked. The monsters however sometimes look downright terrifying, sheesh, thank goodness they're only some polygons on a screen!
There's a few animated movies/cutscenes (FMVs) and they look really good, my guess is that where all the budget really went to. If I'd see these back in the day I'd probably have my mind blown.

As far as music goes, I think this might be one of Nobuo Uematsu's greatest works. I completed the game in a little over 33 hours and somehow I still didn't get burned out by the battle theme (which in some entries got really grating even though it was remastered). Some pieces are eerily captivating, despite invoking some intense feeling of dread when hearing them, there's still something that draws me to listen more. Really good overall!
Favourite pieces in no particular order: Let the Battles Begin!, Cid's Theme, One-Winged Angel, From the Edge of Despair, JENOVA COMPLETE.

Overall, this is a great game, I think the story beats will be enjoyed the most by JRPG veterans as they're done really well. It can be definitely enjoyed as a first entry too, however as the plot doesn't stray that much from the essence of Final Fantasy. A great game throughout, 10/10 pls give it a shot, or play the remake idk if it's good I'll get to play that one day too.

I'll see you in Final Fantasy VIII - REMASTERED, friend.

1.10.2024 Big Major Edit: 

So my opinions about this game have always been kinda weird. I stand by what I said in 2021 but with a huge asterisk: I did not enjoy FF7 on initial playthroughs. It took me a very long time not to hate this game. I always thought it was over-rated garbage until I played it in a particular way and then I enjoyed it. But when I started to replay it recently, I realized the game really just is not fun until the point where you're able to recruit Yuffie.

Why do I say all this? Because literally the only way I can enjoy this game is to have Yuffie and Cid in the party. FF7 was made in a time when game dialogue varied depending on who was in your party when they reached such-and-such cutscene. This was much more of a Thing in the days before mo-cap and voice-acted cutscenes, and is also present in FF6 (and to a lesser extent, in 8). It's a shame that this sort of thing ended because depending on the characters you have in the party, the game feels radically different. It's the same story, but many serious cutscenes are rendered absolutely hilarious if you have certain characters in the party. Not every moment of weight or seriousness is completely abandoned but the entire tone of the game is much lighter with Yuffie in it. Queen.

I think the problem I have is, I'm not a man; I've gone through existential crises but the desire to be Mr. Ubermensch is one borne of male ego, which is something I've never possessed. For all its subversion of male fantasies FF7 still manages to play one completely straight, and that is that Cloud is a chick magnet who still ends up with the fanservice character by the end. I am glad, however, that the game contains the Wall Market sequence, that it hammers home that super soldiers are only made through horrific bioweapons experiments, and that you can take Barret on a ""date"" in the Gold Saucer - like the game clearly wants to make fun of escapism and tough guys, but it never takes it far enough imo. 

idk, it's not a bad game by any means. Probably the best thing that happened to the series if only because it spawned several of my favorite FF entries, and Sephiroth's popularity apparently convinced the devs to go harder on courting the female demographic. FF7 crawled so FF8, 9, and 10 could run. It's still pretty memorable and feels very much like one of the 2D entries, especially 6, which never ever slows down to give you a damn break.

I say it's still very much worth playing, but as someone whose first FF was 10, I just wasn't that wowed the first time I played it - and no, it had nothing to do with the graphics; my first video game console was an N64, and I feel like FF7's ugly graphics have a certain charm to them nearly 30 years later. It's still spectacular, it still has a lot of fun set pieces and bosses. I wish the series had stayed turn-based with gigantic casts of supporting characters. Half the fun of 7 is the supporting cast - but it feels like nobody really understands this, not even Squeenix themselves.

Anyway, it's a pretty solid game, I would recommend it if you can grab it on sale.",1627149577,1704942469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For me, that game was this one. Although it is now a bit of a relic of the past when compared to the scale at which games are made now, it will always have a special place within me. What I have played through in Remake is amazing so far and I'm glad to see a lot of things were left alone. Whatever differences exist between Remake and this, I'd like to think of those differences as another person's point of view of the story they tell or a version of the story to could have been move back then had the current level of technology been available to the original developers. Nevertheless, FFVII is still a classic masterpiece which I believe that everyone should play through at least once. It has great unique characters, a rich story, and a vast set of environments to be explored. Go at your on pace, try to speedrun it, play for the first time blindly, follow any of countless walkthroughs, use any of the mods that are available and suggested by others, or just talk to everyone and explore every single space.

39140,155194014,76561198212668601,0,86,3918,0,3586,1704412857,"If Final Fantasy VI was basically just a group of wizards pushing a game system to its absolute limit in terms of capabilities, Final Fantasy VII is more akin to a ramshackle amalgamation of jankily implemented ideas, held together with old bits of duct tape. Despite how the latter option sounds though, it also fits the kind of gameplay experience that I have a certain fondness of, never being short of ideas whatsoever, just throwing more weird stuff at the wall and watching it lightly come apart at the seams, all tied together with the rest of the game going all out in making setpieces that feel utterly massive in scope. The game in general feels really big in a way that led to it having this effect where I'd often feel the need take big breaks in between play sessions and almost dread returning, but then I'd pick it up again and become enthralled all over again, and by the end I felt pretty confident in this being something that's almost as amazing as people have said for quite some time.

The game strikes this great balance of being incredibly goofy for a lot of its runtime while still maintaining just enough elements of self-seriousness to keep you engaged in the actual narrative going on. Time and time again, the stakes of what's broadly going on around the player is contrasted by a lot of funny character interactions, especially from Cloud, who continues trying to appear very solemn but ends up just being really awkward and a bit in over his head, especially with some of the dialogue options you get in the first half of the game. I really like the way that the game being so consistently off the wall in the first half also works at making the big turning point of the game hit so much harder once all of this is torn away, leaving some moments of levity, but having them be very few and far between.

In terms of the core gameplay, I felt that this took some interesting steps forward to the systems found in FF6, especially with how Materia feels like an evolution of espers in a lot of regards, and one that I like a lot more. One of my biggest problems with the mechanics of FF6 was the way that the espers essentially meant that all of your characters could do anything as long as you put a bit of time in to grind those abilities, limiting the sense of mechanical individuality each character would have outside of their core special ability. While at a glance, the ability to assign any materia to anyone seems to have the same effect, the limited materia slots each character can have will leave each party member in a certain role of your choosing anyway, since there aren't really enough slots to be able to let everyone do everything. This is further bolstered by the stat changes that the materia gives when equipping it, often lowering a couple of stats while raising others, giving a nice layer of strategy to team composition. I like this as a way to make each piece of new equipment feel a bit more interesting and exciting as well, as the more powerful pieces of gear will often come with more materia slots as well. This makes getting better gear not just feel like a statistical bonus, but an opportunity to further expand upon your battle strategy and team complexity.

The combat itself is rather easy for the most part, but provides sufficient enough roadblocks for players who try completely turning their brains off and mashing through everything, it feels comfortable, yet rewards a bit of thought as well. This leads to there being nothing in the main game that requires any grinding as long as you're smart about things, which is especially nice, given that for the first time in the FF series, the random encounters feel sparse enough to almost never be intrusive, which makes the exploration feel more fun. I also love the limit break system, not only for the spectacle of it all, but also with how it manages to make enemies using powerful attacks feel exciting, as while you're obviously damaged and now likely in a rough position, you're a lot closer to being able to unleash something big of your own, making for a wonderful bit of give and take.

This isn't to say that the combat is flawless however, as there are definitely some issues that became increasingly annoying as the game went on. I feel like with each passing game, the ATB system has felt more intrusive and annoying, with this being the peak of that for a few reasons. The reason why I thought this was a neat system in FF4 mainly was because of the little quirks in the character loadouts that specifically played out in ways that wouldn't translate quite as well in pure turn based gameplay, such as making twincast feel cooler because of its slowly charging bar, but by FF7, an instance of this stuff is almost nowhere to be seen, making it feel superfluous at best. These issues are exacerbated by the UI, as while it's visually appealing, it's so big that it barely shows any actual information either. This is most egregious when you need to scroll your inventory for an item and only 3 of them can be shown on screen at once, leading to a lot of scrolling while the enemies are still able to keep attacking, it just feels awful all around, and while the other abilities you can use aren't quite as egregious as this, it's a common problem that becomes especially frustrating once you're far enough in the game that this can become very costly. Other elements of the UI that felt bothersome were the way that targeting had a tendency to be quite finicky due to the shifting camera angles and fact that there aren't really any strong bits of feedback to let you know what you're targeting unless you press a separate button to bring up another element that clutters the screen more.

The game is still very fun despite these issues though. The constant minigames were always a highlight to me, especially with the way that no matter how simple something seemed, it was actually horribly broken in one way or another. While I get that not everyone's sentiment would quite be the same as mine here, I couldn't help but smile whenever one of these appeared and brought forth a new frontier of barely functioning nonsense. After all, how can you not at least find a bit of comedy in your ascent up to one of the most significant moments in the narrative having a random snowboarding section that controls horrifically? It's not just the jank that I find endearing in the game though, as the game can pull off some absolutely fantastic bits of spectacle when it wants to, with the fearsome power of the Weapons being especially notable, easily standing out as one of the coolest things in any of the Final Fantasy games up to this point. Thanks to them, along with a few other specific points in the story, disc 2 ends up being this constant thrill, overcoming the one other big issue I had with FF6, that being its largely uninteresting 2nd half.

This game is just awesome, everything feels so big and flashy, with the summons especially benefiting from this. The experience is undoubtedly a bit of a mess, with the seams being very visible all over the place, along with there clearly being some ideas that were added very late into development and ended up being visibly half-baked as a result, but what we got here is still a phenomenal achievement.

To this day, FFVII remains one of my favorite games of all time, and its influence has had far-reaching effects on JRPGs and games since. It was pretty enjoyable to play this game again and get every last achievement. 

Since I still had to beat the Ruby Weapon and Emerald Weapon superbosses, I decided to let that be the first thing I do for the new year. With two sets of Magic Counter+Knights of the Round on Cloud and Mimic on Yuffie and Cid, it ended up being pretty overkill and each boss only got a few attacks in and no one was ever KO'd in battle. I also managed to not have Ruby Weapon use Whirlsand on any of my party members, so I think this was my first time beating Ruby without losing anyone. The theorycrafting potential in this game is fantastic and I've yet to see its equal!

However, I admit that the game feels a bit clunky now, and this port isn't particularly great, but it doesn't detract too much from it. I just wish the controller support was a bit better considering its original was from a console. The fact that Steam Cloud has been a thing for many years and Square-Enix never utilized it, instead favoring their own cloud save service that's inferior, makes me disappointed. I don't trust SE to always keep the service running.

FFVII gets 10/10 from me, and this port gets an 8.5/10.",1704109879,1704110525,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I am a little tired of the battle and enemy spawn systems. It starts to feel repetitive to me. However, that's probably my biggest grudge of the game. Other gameplay elements are great. It feels exciting to see my magic get more fabulous, and my weapons deal more damage. I love the story, I love the settings, and I love the music. Holy shit the music is fire. I just made my first visit to the Cosmic Canyon and this area is so beautifully designed.

Beat Sephiroth.
I can now say for certain that I love Final Fantasy VII. It's a very long game, but not exactly too-repetitive. I did barely any pure-leveling outside of chasing the main story objective. As I said before, I get tired of the game here and there, but I am always motivated to pick it back up, because the story is simply intriguing. The final fight with Sephiroth has to be the best boss fight in the entire series. After dying in his second phase for 3-4 times, I became horrified of him. I even start to question myself: Is this guy even beatable? How is he this tanky and powerful? But after I did some extra leveling, and changed up my strategy to focus on survival rather than damage output in the fight, I easily strained him out and beat him. 

The reason I enjoyed this fight so much is that it taught me a very valuable lesson. Challenges are always more imposing than they really are, and the hardest part is to accept the difficulty at-hand and confronting it head-on. Once you are able to face those hurdles candidly, you will find that those hardships aren't nearly as imposing as they are.

Thank you, FF VII.",1695879838,1703977325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was the very first game and story I ever truly fell in love with as a kid on a PS1 that inspired me as a person through and through from personality to aesthetic; only falling a tad bit behind by it's prequel PSP title, Crisis Core that paved even more of an inspiration and influence through the main character. Without any spoilers involved and going on a long winded rant... In every way, shape and form; Final Fantasy VII is a god send of a game with a colorful, deeply developed lovable cast that made way for an entire shift in the RPG genre as a whole that I strongly feel everyone should experience once in their life, FAR more than the Remake which will never hold a candle to with it's ridiculously, slap in the face leveled story shift decisions.

As sappy as it is in my review, I'd like to give a huge thank you to old school, Squaresoft. Even if you're now a memory in the shadow that is corporate, money greedy Square Enix; where you stood holding heart that's no longer there in modern day, you made these revolutionary stories that gave two whole generations everlasting stories with life lessons and single handedly gave a reason for at least one person to beat their depression and continue living onward with this amazing title.

P.S. If you're looking to play it for the first time, be sure to pick up the 7th Heaven Mod Launcher for HD Textures, recompiled music / ambience and the Echo-S Voice Mod performed by the most talented group of unpaid voice actors that deserve far more credit than they receive for the best experience.

With a few mods this version can be transformed into believing this is an amazing unofficial official modern day remastered HD version in terms of improving of the visuals and presentation and other fixes. The pre-rendered background of the environment greatly helps keep the game from looking dated and helps capture the essence of this story. 

The story is interesting, the characters, not just the memorable party members but also the supporting characters, to the npcs you encounter in towns and the antagonists like the Turks are memorable. 

The location settings visited is varied with different landscapes and types of environments that tell its own stories with distinctive themes. From the dark mega dystopian like industrial city of Midgar and underneath the Midgar slums, to travelling to just regular idyllic looking villages, and then to the striking likes of Cosmo Canyon, Icicle Inn, Fort Condor, Rocket Town and the desolate North Corel, to seaside resorts and snowy plains was immersive and the whole experience along with great music captures the imagination of this whole journey.

The gameplay of the ATB(active time battle) system and the enemies is fun and engaging. The materia system of customizing different abilities into armor and weapons and combining for different effects was deep and effective part of the combat was a great system, and so was the levelling up progression of the materias and each characters individual powerful limit skills. 

It of course is a game of its time so there will be many random encounters. There are also events or items that could be missed without knowing about even if you thought you paid attention to all of the details in the game. Furthermore some parts like the Golden Saucer, Chocobo breeding and the Fort Condor battles while fun and enjoyable, it can also be excessively grindy and take much time to achieve the desired result with a lot of backtracking.

The game also has a lot of hidden depth of its symbolism like all Final Fantasy games that are worth looking into understand more of what this game represents.

Playing this with keyboard at first generally worked well even if the screen prompts did not provide clear understanding of the corresponding buttons. However once encountering mini games the experience with using a keyboard degraded to the point it is essential to play with a controller. With a Dualshock 3 controller it was smooth sailing.

Only other sticking point was the requirement to create a separate Square Enix account for specifically only this game.",1702768842,1702823183,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This review is critical of Square Enix's poorly conceived and terribly implemented release of this game on Steam.

Launching the game is locked behind a Square Enix account login and there is no way to circumvent this, which isn't and issue by itself, other games have similar systems that don't impede gameplay in any significant way.

The issue is that that Square Enix has shown that they are unable to host and maintain a user account system capable of handling the number of users they are forcing into it.
Their password recovery system does not work as intended.
Their email account confirmation does not work as intended.
their support ticketing system and their password recovery system require personal information that is in no way relevant to most technical issues.
Their system which allows account creation using an existing Steam account results in an account in which users don't know the Email, ID, or Password, preventing a player from using that account with Square Enix products on platforms other than Steam.

The problems detailed above extend well beyond a game from 1997, this issue plagues their MMOs (Final Fantasy 11 and final fantasy 14), their recent official Marvel games, their remake of Final Fantasy 7, and it will affect future releases in an equally horrible way.",1639894281,1702532693,False,168,8,0.802021384239196777,0,True,False,False

Back when they would go above and beyond on every aspect of a game, and kept pushing the boundary of what was possible with the hardware they had. Putting so much content in the game, not for the money, but just because they wanted to make the best game possible. It is hard to give games from that Era anything less then 10/10. And this game is no exception, lengthy FMV's that had quality for the time, a story that had you invested and wanting more, a villain who you love because he is so cool but hate at the same time, and multiple characters to interact with and play with, with mini games and side stories. It is truly a masterpiece of it's time. It is one of those games that you have to experience at least once in your life.
I played this version with 7th Heaven Mod Manager that downloads the mods within the manager to make life easier. With the correct mods, the game will run at full speed,FMV's at 60fps and more fluid UI. Quick Google search will help you find it.

Ifrit Interface tweaks

This game is one of the most critically acclaimed JRPG of all time and I believe that it certainly does hold up in some aspects. The story is one of the most unique stories I've ever seen in a JRPG, and I definitely believe that this was a factor in FFVII's success as a world renowned game. Essentially no other game has dealt with the theme of environmentalism and whether or not humans are destructive to the planet. This is vastly different from a generic JRPG plot like FFI where you must stop the Evil Chaos from reviving and destroying the world, as the plot is actually Man Vs Nature. What is also notable is the amazing character designs. These are some of the best character designs in the series, but it also helps that they are all written very well. Final Fantasy does a good job with its characters, and making them stand out especially Cloud and Sephiroth. Even though Sephiroth looks like the most evil man alive, his reasoning for doing so is more nuanced than you would think, and seeing some of the characters in the game you may be inclined to agree with him, but Cloud brings a very nice dichotomy to the character that argues otherwise that there is hope which I do like. One thing I will say is that this gameplay sucks big ass, and the graphics are completely terrible. Out of all the other games, this game just looks completely terrible and you can tell. This is why I played with mods. The gameplay is AT system so yeah have fun, they also broke the game by allowing every character to use any kind of materia so pretty much no character is unique other than weapons. But overall I think I would recommend this game for the story alone, as there is no other game like it.

A game that, honestly, passes the test of time in my opinion. A really intriguing plot about the lengths humanity can go in order to achieve what they want, [b]no matter the consequences[/b]. A game about identity, existential crises, and loss. A genuinely fascinating adventure... that is unfortunately hindered by this release. Because the thing is, no matter how thrilling its plot may be, no matter how exciting its world may be to explore, no matter how fun its combat system may be, and no matter how much content the game may have; if you constantly have to deal with issue, after issue, after another fucking issue,... well, it just kind of ruins the experience, honestly.

So, just as you buy and boot up the game, you'll notice something: You [b]must have[/b] a Square Enix account to even play it. I'm really not a big fan of having to make another account for a game I bought on Steam, so while this wasn't a deal breaker for me... it was a massive disappointment. Then, when you finally access the game, you'll be greeted by a gigantic wall of text explaining the controls. Pretty absurd in my opinion, but please do take a screenshot and keep it close to you, since you can't use a controller here, and while a controller has a limited amount of buttons, a keyboard has... well, just a few more keys I'd say (and no, there's no option to change the key bindings). Anyways, you're playing the game, having a jolly good time and, for whatever reason you decide to Alt+Tab. Congrats! You just froze your PC, being your only option now to reboot it. But you endure through all this and invest... about a dozen hours into the game. So you keep going, but strangely, when you reach a certain area, the screen just... goes black? That's because you were playing the game without manually enabling the W7 compatibility mode, you silly!... And let's just say you decide to take a break from the game and end up uninstalling it from your system. Well I don't know if this is a common occurance, but in my case, [b]Square Enix's cloud save system didn't work[/b]. Thanks to this I lost all my progress back then. The entirety of the first part. About [b]20 hours... Yeah I'm fine[/b].

Believe it or not, this is not a strong ""[b]Not Recommended [/b]"". It is one of my favourite JRPGs ever, after all. But, if possible, just avoid this version of the game... An old game's re-release (whether a port, a remake, a remaster, or whatever), should be an opportunity to bring the absolute best possible version of said classic title. But in this port's case, you have to add these outrageous issues to the ones the original had (poor translation, odd camera angles, softlocks, weird controls,...).

So yeah, in conclusion, you should play [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i] still... But there [b]must[/b] better ways to experience this absolute PS1 classic...",1602157949,1701931665,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,True,False

I personally haven't had much experience with JRPGs sadly. All the games I've played from the genre overall are so few, so I understand that making any judgemental statement regarding its dedicated certain mechanics would be equal to judging a book by its cover. I've yet to form a proper mindset about it, thus I'll avoid making any subjective comments in my review. 

Like I've stated before, Final Fantasy VII is revolutionary for the time it came out and we can easily agree to the fact that it is the most popular PSX game. Its story, along with its world are simply wonderful. The way it makes you feel for the characters in spite of the fact that its localization made by simply one guy is beyond amazing. I simply cannot stop praising Final Fantasy VII's story, universe, and soundtrack, so I'll cut it short and let you enjoy the rest without giving you any major spoilers. Although it's been 25 years since the game came out, the remake is on the horizon and I'm sure there are people out there with low-end PCs that can't handle the remake just like me, thus giving out a major spoiler would be a total dick move. 

I don't think I'm qualified to make an objective comment for its gameplay, therefore the things you're going to read in the next few sentences are ignorantly subjective. It has a great gameplay overall with lots of powers infused in magical objects called ""Materia"" which makes the gameplay more diverse and interesting. However, if you're aiming for the 100% completion rate, exploration may be a pain in the ass due to random encounters in some areas but keep in mind that the hard work pays off extremely well in the end. You basically end up way too OP that nothing will stand in yours and your party members' way. The special moves of the characters called ""Limit Break"" are also a great addition and they perfectly balance out things if you're lacking in combat. It's also worth mentioning that a lot of work went into the Summon Materias and they are also as good as Limit Breaks, if not better.

To sum up things without dragging this out any longer, Final Fantasy VII has been a game that I've enjoyed. I've played Crisis Core on my PSP a long time ago and playing this game recently gave me another reason to go through all that again - properly this time!",1657399459,1701876985,True,11,0,0.628107964992523193,0,True,True,False

I've been playing for 20 hours, waiting to see if the game gets good. Having just finished what was originally disc one's content, can I honestly say that it finally got good by that point? Well, it got better, I guess. Around the 15 hour mark, some of my materia FINALLY started upgrading (materia are placed in slots on your equipment, which in turn equip that character with skills, healing/debuffing/buffing/offensive magic, passive bonuses, summons, etc.), giving me more options and versatility in combat, which up to this point had been rather mundane. The story is JUST starting to sorta get good, but still nothing all that special. There''s been the occasional neat FMV sequence, which I'm sure was really cool in 1997.

I think I might still end up seeing this playthrough all the way to the end... maybe. But this game has been REALLY hard for me to actually get into. Reassigning controls to my Xbox controller was confusing, and so I needed to look up help with that. Navigating 3D character models in pseudo 3D environments that are really just 2D pre-rendered scenes (kind of like a blurry painting) was confusing, and so at times, even WITH the assist feature that marks exits/entrances and SOME interactable objects, I got confused and needed a walkthrough to help me figure out how to get through a particular scene. Eventually after escaping Midgar, it becomes plain how difficult it is to know where to go on the overworld map (so I needed to look up a labeled map). Sometimes the way forward is just super cryptic, needlessly so. The world map is bland and ugly looking. You quickly forget which place on the map is which (seriously, in-game labels for each area might have been helpful). 

But the STORY, people say! The story and story-telling for FFVII was unforgettable, right? Not so much. The plot starts off as a pretty boring 'rebels vs. the big corporation' story with heavy environmentalist overtones. Then it evolves into a slightly less boring story about a different big bad guy with a bone to pick with said corporation, on a quest to basically become a god and wreak epic vengeance on the planet (you start off weak, level and gear up, learn amazing spells and become super powerful, and kill god... format of every JRPG ever). Honestly, I think Kefka from FFVI was a much better villian. Many of the other characters don't even really save the story for me (Ok, maybe Red XIII is kinda cool). Most all the characters are UGLY, for one (really not sold on these crappy looking 3D models... and I've played lots of games from that era that looked a lot better)... and outside the main party, other characters (especially the suits with Shinra) are even uglier or just boring looking. The way the party looks in combat is alright, actually... I really wish that's how they looked during all the story sequences and cut scenes. Apart from maybe Red XIII's brief arc in Cosmo Canyon, none of the character development thus far has compelled me to like or care what happens to any of them. Admittedly, I'd probably like them better if they weren't so ugly, either done with really good pixel art, or if I ever cared to play through the remake... the characters are obviously a lot more expressive there.

The combat? It's Ok, if not really slow. As I said, it's pretty bland until 15 hours or so in. I've got lots of my different starter materia now, that have mostly leveled up at least once, so I'm getting stronger and my combat menu is getting more complicated, offering more depth of strategy (FINALLY). But the menu-ing behind the scenes to set up for combat, super annoying. Your materia set-up on any given character's equipment basically determines that character's role (healer/mage/thief/summoner/etc.). In fact, a character with no materia equipped is largely a blank slate. So, you want/have to change characters? Well, plan on unequipping each materia, one by one, THEN switching out the character, and then re-equipping each of those materia. Got a bunch of epic new equipment from a shop or dungeon? Sorry, those other three characters not currently in your party, if you want to equip the new stuff so you can promptly sell the old stuff, you're going to have to exit the town (if that's even PERMITTED at that point in the story!), as you can only switch out characters on the world map or at certain pre-determined spots in the story (that's right, no equipping instantly upon purchase here).

So, an only so-so story and story-telling, some really confusing gameplay segments that frequently requires having a walkthrough open on my phone's browser, ugly art style and graphics, and lots of clunky menu mechanics (I honestly much preferred the magicite/esper system from FFVI)... I can't in all honesty recommend this game, unless, like I was, you're SUPER curious about it as a historical relic. But don't be like me buying it at full price... get it on a sale.

(PS. No, this is not merely a case of 'he just doesn't like JRPGs.' I love Chrono Trigger. FFVI was an amazing experience. Megaman X: Command Mission was awesome. I thoroughly enjoyed Bravely Default. Xenoblade Chronicles was breathtaking even on the 3DS, and well-written. First experienced most all of these titles as an adult. Yeah, I like JRPGs. I just don't like bad ones. And continuing to play this sub-par JRPG, leaves me wondering why I'm bothering with this, when I could be playing something a lot more fun, like Sea of Stars).",1700793522,1700794287,False,7,0,0.481598734855651855,0,True,False,False

While I went in ready to call this game overrated, what I got was a grand adventure that I couldn't put down. Playing every spare second I had over the past week and seeking out all the side content I could find to total a 55ish hour experience over the course of 8 days (I played the midgar section back in 2020 before remake and had some idle time to get to 72 at time of review). It didn't overstay it's welcome and I didn't want it to end! This is rare for me when an rpg goes past about 30 hours these days.

Reviewing one of the greatest or at least most iconic games of all time, 26 years after the US release seems like a pointless task so I'll give quick opinions.

Highlights: The soundtrack gave me chills at every major moment. Sephiroth is a cool, layered villain. The ramp up in power level and new materia was well paced and satisfying. The materia and gear system is great, allowing you to change characters and their role in battles completely whenever you want. I found myself really experimenting with different combinations and very satisfied when I would come up with a new build for a character.

In the middle: Cloud is kind of a dull protag being way outshined by your lively and memorable party members. Although towards the end I was tired of about half of them but continued to love the likeable half. (Halfway through part 2, I was only using Barret, Tifa, and occasionally Vincent.)

Disappointment: So many mini-games that just weren't fun to play, many of which you had to participate in to unlock side content. Sometimes the ""platforming"" is frustrating, having to move the joystick in one direction to have cloud perform a jump or go up a staircase/ladder in a different direction. Many of the environments are quite ugly today and hard to tell what is even a walkable path. When the pre-rendered environments are beautiful, they clash extremely with the items and characters on screen, sort of ruining any admiration you may have for it.

The controls can be a bit awkward - I tried to play with a controller and the dpad did not work, so I settled for the keyboard and it was generally ok, after remapping some of the controls. A few commands have in-game names such as [SWITCH] or [ASSIST], and those are initially mapped to keyboard keys like delete and insert. For the majority of the game you only need those keys occasionally and it works out fine, but for some of the minigames you would need three hands if you keep this default scheme. 

I played in fullscreen and did not mess with any of the graphic settings in the launcher, and some of the text outside of menus (like store plaques) was completely ineligible. That did not bother me enough to change stuff around in the settings, so I don't know if that can be avoided in this version or not.

Oh and by the way, there’s this weird black screen bug that occurs if you alt-tab while in fullscreen. To fix this, play it in windowed mode.

Story:

You play as a mercenary named Cloud (or change his name to whatever you desire) joining Barret and its eco-terrorist group called AVALANCHE against the megacorp Shinra Electric Power Company or just Shinra, draining the Planet’s Lifestream for energy thus weakening the Planet.

During the journey you’ll meet Aerith, a kind, cheerful, girl who is half-human, half-Cetra. Cetra, an ancient race who look just regular humans that has the power to communicate with the Planet via the Lifestream. Now being the only Cetra left alive, Shinra took an interest with Aerith and kidnapped her. Believing she’s the key in revealing the “Promised Land”.

Over the course of the game, Sephiroth reveals himself who was thought to be dead five years before the game. Your party, now, having a cat and mouse chase with Sephiroth and the president of Shinra right on your trail.

Gameplay:

The game uses the ATB system (Active Time Battle) where you have a bar gauge that determines when will your party members act. When the bar is full, that’s when you’ll choose your course of action. One you’ve chosen an action, the bar gets depleted and must wait again. This adds a bit of layer to the combat and requires quick thinking as your enemy won’t wait for you to decide an action. However, there is an option to choose “Wait” mode where your other party members and the enemies bar is paused while you’re trying to decide on what your current active party member do. So it’s your typical turn-based. You have to time it right on whether you’ll attack, heal, buff, debuff etc. Sometimes choosing an action immediately instead of waiting it out can cause you the game especially against the optional superbosses. But the game is easy enough with minimal grinding unless you go for the achievements

The game also uses the Materia system which you can give your party members various abilities and spells. This replaces the class system. I mean, yeah, sure, you can go and give them spells and commands that’s appropriate based on their design but where’s the fun in that? You want to go with a physical build for Aerith? You definitely can. Depending on what materia you equipped, it’ll give you stat bonuses. Leveling some of them up will give you new spells and abilities.

With all that said, my time spent with this game was one for the books. It definitely didn’t age well in terms of graphics and the quality of life changes from games that came after it but if you can look past that, it’s a worthwhile journey.",1699376719,1699376719,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I got it back in the 90s and played it a good amount on my family's first proper PC computer, and it was brilliant; I probably would have enjoyed this just the same on the PlayStation if my family had gotten that console before the PC, but I digress. It was so good, it was the one that hooked me into the Final Fantasy series itself.

The game, while somewhat dated, is still a pure gem and still works well on modern systems. The combat remains fun and engaging, with the materia system a sweet part of augmenting the characters for battles. The game world is enjoyable to explore, the mini-games and side activities are fun (such as the motorbike section), and the cutscenes are brilliant to watch as I remember them.

The game has a good pace to it, and some of the later battles, including some of the more trickier boss fights, are worth the effort of doing. The music is also memorable - the battle music gets me a lot - and it has its nice quirky moments, such as the bleeped swears of Barrett, the blocky nature of the characters in the game world, and the three variations of Bahamut you can summon.

While I do like to get my hands on the FFVII Remake eventually, this is a must-have game for any player. Just as Top Gear says owning an Alfo Romeo is essential to be a true petrolhead, owning the original Final Fantasy VII, amongst some of the other games from the 1990s, is essential to becoming a true gamer.",1508670688,1698786988,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The character models are hideous, the background graphics are bad resolution, the mini-games have clunky controls, some of the text was awkwardly translated, and the combat has some questionable design choices. 

It should tell you something that despite all these flaws, the game is considered one of the greatest of all time and is getting a full blown three-part triple-A remake over 20 years after being released. That's because under all these flaws is one of the greatest works of art ever made. The main story and even side stories are deep and emotional. The soundtrack and general atmosphere of the game is very well done. The combat system is simple to understand but allows for an almost infinite amount of creativity.

You may ask, ""Is there any reason to play this once the remake is finished?"" There are perks to both the original and the remake. The remake will be split across three games, so it will not only cost more for the remake, but also likely take a lot longer to experience the full story since it is very drawn out. That being said, the remakes have a lot more content in total, and have better graphics and writing. Their more detailed graphics also lets the remakes better convey minor details, like subtle character expressions. The original is almost certainly easier, and focuses more on turn-based strategy rather than real-time action that the remakes use. I think it is mostly up to personal opinion, but if you play the remakes and enjoy them, I'm sure you would also enjoy seeing the original vision of the game. I will always prefer the original, mostly just for nostalgia.

The port of the game has a few flaws. I cannot find a way to rebind the controls when using a physical controller, even using a couple of different ones. I've also noticed a few slight errors, such as music changing prematurely, or text being out of alignment. The port does have some improvements over the original PlayStation version, like allowing way more saves, and fixing some of the typos. This PC port gets the job done, but playing the game on an original PS1 or on the latest PlayStation might be better if possible.",1487572389,1698611673,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I swear to God, platforming and QTEs in this game are the most frustrating things ever. It shouldn't take 2-3 random encounters to get Cloud to climb a fucking ladder. And even if they removed the awful gun drills, snowboarding, ""DODGE THAT PUNCH!"", and other terrible forced mini-game sequences from the game, people will still defend this game with the ""it was good for its time"" excuse when there are other games like VI that did a lot of things better and call it a masterpiece. Hell, XIII has the same battle system but better (even with autobattle spam), even better than VIIR. But all you hear about is complaints about the linearity which for XIII is only the first 16 hours of the game, but for X, is basically the entire game. But which one do you hear about being a ""masterpiece""? FF fans have their standards all over the place and clearly don't know what the hell they want and that's exactly why the devs gave you Devil May Fantasize XVI

All VII did differently from VI was 3D. False marketing drew a lot of people in to what would be the first FF for them and that's what a lot of people ended up sticking with. So when we say ""for its time"", that really only applies to the graphics and 3D was a really big novelty back then

Port is fine. I went through this on the Steamdeck so I had the boon of not having to dredge through another hour just to save in case windows decided to update and shut my PC off and I'd say the community layout is mandatory so don't use the default controls. You can't really go wrong for 5 bucks, but honestly just watch a playthrough then go play the ""Requel"" as I like to put it and take anything you hear from the fanbase with a grain of salt before forcing yourself into a 60 hour playthrough of a game wondering what the hell it is people see in this game",1698594794,1698608444,False,1,0,0.426056325435638428,2,True,False,False

FF7 isn't the best FF game, but it's definitely the most important. I think it's worth a playthrough due to how iconic it is, and is a great experience overall, but I think FF5 or FF9 are much, much better.

My biggest issue is that the Steam version is a pile of crap. Keybinds for this game are horrendous and considering how many minigames there are in this game, they really do expect you to use the Page up/Down Keys, as well as you need to log into SE's stupid service. 

I'd recommend the PS4 version, since theres no login and has the bare minimum of QoL features to keep the game playable. You don't need full voice acting, you don't need higher quality models on the overworld, etc. That ruins the charm of the game with how early-PS1 it is.",1698086123,1698086123,False,1,0,0.440446376800537109,0,True,False,False

FFVII is an alright game, it came out at an odd time for me so I never actually sat down and gave this one a chance, VIII and IX in my opinion shat all over this one and to say there is only 1/3 years between VII and IX the graphical difference is insane. VII really seemed to struggle with the hardware (Understandable psone was only in it's infancy) however VIII and IX seemed to where the hardware had peaked and that made me want to go to them more. I wasn't interested in the stories, I just loved FF games at that time...Roll forwards 25 years and here I am once again going through most of the Final Fantasy games to see what exactly I missed the first time around and I gotta say...it's alot! The whole Crisis Core thing with Zack! The fact FFVII is slapbang in the middle of it's timeline is why I love the idea of it being remade because I never played Crisis or Dirge of cerberus so hopefully the remake will mesh these two together cos there are a lot of plot points that are missed in VII that im sure Crisis core will explain.

FFVII begins in Midgar, not a very exciting area, just 8 Mako reactors surrounding a devious corp known as Shinra. You play as Ex-soldier Cloud Strife and join a band of misfits known an AVALANCHE and you cause chaos in your first 10-15 hours in Midgar. Upon leaving and going out into the open world you're tasked with chasing your idle - Sephiroth, who seemingly has gone mental. There's lots of talk about Ancients and Sephiroth being of a higher power and Hojo pulling strings. Getting to know a ton of party members like Yuffie and Vincent (nobody likes the cato).

All goes to shit relatively quickly and it's one hell of a bender to get your head around but being older it all makes fucking sense now and it's actually a damn good plot and it plays out really well, I enjoyed it. It still isn't to die for but for it's time it sounds good and the game plays out the way the stories tells it rather than jumping all over the place for no reason. There's just so much to this game it's ridiculous. For it's time ofc.

Graphically - as stated above, they're not the best the polygons are massive and it's what pushed me away on it's release but they have a charm too them now and it's likeable.

Sounds - Like most FF's the soundboards for spells and summons and insufferable but it's understandable with the soundboards they had at the time and again I find it oddly charming to hear such shit in 2023.

Features - Having played FFVII on the PS4 I half expected there to be features like 3x speed or auto battle but I was disappointed to find this version has none of that for some strange reason, so I had to play the old fashioned way...avoid spells and summons that take minutes upon minutes to cast just to do 9999 or something I could have done using a simple ATK command...shame they were missing. Now you can Mod these features in and I was going to using 7th Heaven but I was already on Disc 3 by the time I had found the mod and I didn't wanna corrupt my save or have to start a fresh file so I persevered.

Materia - This games strongest point, If I was playing at 3x speed I would have experimented more with magic and summoning but due to lack of wanting to watch an animation for 10mins for minimal damage I only used Purple and Yellow Materia really so all my party members were heavily melee oriented and I still managed to beat all the bosses and superbosses before I hit level 99 or did any stat farming in the Sunken ship.

The Magic - There are so many different spells in this game compared to most others and they upgrade in good time with the story too, the spells powering up felt similar to that of FFX you grind and grind to a point and get Thunder 2 or Thundera at certain points and it helps massively. 
The sheer volume of spells i'd not seen in other FF games is insane not the mention the blue magic spells which are just as over powered as regular spells, why Square decided to cut down on all these extra spells and summons i'll never know, there's 3 types of bahamut in this game and I loved watching all 3 animations not to mention Knights of the Round a summon i've never seen anywhere but here and it's just amazing to watch those damage numbers man!

The music - Time after time Final Fantasy is known for it's score and it is no different here, there are some belter tracks with this games soundtrack like most FF games, VII has some top tier music!

Overall - FFVII is a gem, I still don't favour it over say FFVIII or IX because it doesn't come close to them games, not for me. But VII is a good game for it's time and the amount of content and different things you can do with your characters is phenomenal given titles of late that don't come close to this level of freedom. 
The amount of grinding VII expects from you to get 100% achievements is also not even near as bad as VIII and IX they are much much worse.
FFVII is even easier than most FF's, you can literally just use Atk command on most enemies and the game will win itself, the only time I found myself needing to pick out a strat was vs Emerald and Ruby and when entering the final dungeon the first time as some enemies have death strike and such other status effects that will make that walk in the park turn into a sudden game over for no reason.

I'd give this a 7/10 - The features being missing is the biggest flaw for me, I could a had this done in 20-30 hours but instead i'm treading on 50 due to the time wasted flying, running and doing battles all in 1x speed.
If I were to go again at some point I would be using 7th Heaven and taking full advantage of all the mods on hand.

About the only problem we had was the controller support, but you can just play the game with keyboard anyways. Really get that ""playing an almost 30 year old PS1 RPG on PC"" experience.

Beautifully written game. Tackling themes like the crimes of corporations & militaries, climate crises, and the loss of self-identity. There are less characters than VI, but the development of each character is a lot better along the way. Definitely recommend having a sidequest guide because there are serious story beats you can miss along the way.

Gameplay? It's fine. It's a more simplistic use of the ATB system than VI, and while the characters feel more unique personality-wise, gameplay-wise there's little difference. Some characters are ranged, some characters are a little tankier. Ultimately, you just put whatever Materia you want on them since any character can have any ability. Basically becomes ""bring along your fave"" in terms of choosing your party. The real downside of the battle systems is the summons. They're your best attacks late-game but they're also just unskippable minute long cutscenes. Definitely recommend putting a podcast on or something so you're not just staring into space watching the same animation for the millionth time.

Stuff like that makes the game feel dated, and it's a specific kind of dated. It's the dated of making a killer app for the PS1. A lot of time is spent making full use of them fancy 3D graphics. The pre-rendered environment backgrounds are beautiful, but also sometimes incomprehensible. What are the exits? Where do you go? Ramps will hide in the backgrounds of walls. Some minigames are just basic 3D polygons being thrown together, making stuff like Fort Condor entirely unappealing to look at. There's also this weird thing the game does of making you press certain buttons for certain minigames. Why does one make me use Switch to fire a gun, but another uses Accept? Well, probably to get new users used to the PS1 controller, but now it's just weird and makes me spend extra time on each minigame figuring out what buttons I'm even using.

Overall, though, the game's good! It's a classic, of course it's pretty good. Where it lacks in gameplay, it makes up for with an emotional core and a memorable cast.

[h1]{ Gameplay } --- 8/10: Very good[/h1]

Its gameplay is pretty simple on face value, but there's a lot more depth than what most would give it credit for, especially for its age!

The Good:
     • The Materia system is absolutely incredible, and allows for near limitless combinations
     • Fun environmental ""puzzles""
     • Allows for a decent variety of play styles
The Bad:
     • General combat can be kind of ""meh"" at times
     • Random encounters happen far too often, even for a veteran player


[h1]{ Difficulty } --- 5/10: Generally easy[/h1]

Because Square felt that some audiences might not finish the game if it was too difficult, they made this one a helluva lot easier. That being said, by today's standards it may still seem difficult because of how these older games are designed. If you have any clue how to play, it'll be a cakewalk, but if you can't pick up on context clues or expect the game to tell you what to do, you may struggle.

The Easy:
     • You do NOT need to grind, but doing so will always help if you get stuck
     • Fairly intuitive structure, you'll know what to do in gameplay
     • Enemies do NOT scale to your level as you progress, negating challenge as you get stronger
The Hard:
     • Easy to get lost your first time
     • Emerald and Ruby Weapon! These super-bosses can be taken down just fine with a guide and some Materia grinding, but these guys will eat you alive if you go in without the right prep.

Pro-tip: If you want more from the combat, enable ""ATB"" and slide the Battle Speed all the way to the left!


[h1]{ Music } --- 10/10: Masterpiece[/h1]

There's not a lot to say about Nobuo Uematsu's work that hasn't been said before, but once more, an absolutely iconic soundtrack that defined many people's childhoods. There are some deeply profound tracks, ranging from despairing, eerie, hopeful and epic, to timeless.

Some bangers include:
     • One-Winged Angel (duh!)
     • Cosmo Canyon
     • Cid's Theme
     • Aerith's Theme
     • Reunion
     • Judgment Day


[h1]{ Story } --- 9/10: Unforgettable[/h1]

While not #1 in the series, FF7's endearing cast of characters & hair-raising second and third acts leave you wanting more, while going out on a bittersweet note. While Sephiroth is no doubt a classic villain by now, this is one of those stories where the hero is actually more messed up than the villain. The plot twists near the middle of the game are incredible, and [spoiler]Aerith's death is sure to make you shed a tear.[/spoiler]

Nitpick: It's really easy to miss some of the game's optional story, which is essential to the character of Vincent and [spoiler]why Zack is relevant for Crisis Core.[/spoiler]


[h1]{ Length } --- 30-50 hours --- Lovely![/h1]

The game doesn't pad itself out, but there's plenty of optional side content and adventures that allow you to go off the path if you feel like it.


[h1]{ Graphics } --- 4/10: Not great[/h1]

I've tried getting some of my friends to experience this wonderful gem, but they never get far because of the graphics... and what a shame! They ask me why I'd choose this over the remake, and my answer never lies within the visuals. Though I find it charming since I grew up with the game, I'd be lying if I said that this aspect has aged well, and it's the number one reason that this game deserves the remake it's getting.

The Good:
     • Gorgeous, detailed field BACKGROUNDS
     • Iconic scenery like Midgar and the Northern Cave
     • Beautiful character portraits by Tetsuya Nomura
The Bad:
     • Difficult to interpret where you can and cannot go in the field, if you don't already know
     • Character models look downright goofy at times, making it hard to take things seriously
     • Cutscenes feel jarring


[h1]{ Price } --- $11.99: AN ABSOLUTE STEAL!!![/h1]

Worth every penny and then some. It goes on sale several times per year for about half off, but if you have any interest in this game, you don't have to wait to get your money's worth.


[h1]{ Bugs } --- 2/10: Quirky[/h1]

I played this copy with a mod manager, so I can't speak to how Steam handles it, but I've literally never had an issue with this game. There aren't any gamebreaking bugs, and the only problem I ever had was not being able to leave the ""Mime"" materia cave. But most ""bugs"" in this game merely serve to enhance your experience if you know how to exploit them, such as with the W-item glitch. Check 4-8Productions for the crazier ones!


[h1]{ Audience } --- Anyone 10 or older[/h1]

While this game is aimed towards teenagers and young adults, there's little that a middle schooler wouldn't be capable of handling. Many of the mature themes and concepts will be lost on younger children, but there's nothing inappropriate which prevents them from playing.

[h1]{ PC Requirements } --- It turns on[/h1]

I recommend using 7th Heaven to install some graphical and QOL mods for the game, which most modern computers should be able to handle just fine.


All in all, FFVII is a wonderful time, and a must-play for anyone that wants to explore this era of gaming. Doubtless, it revolutionized 3D JRPGs in the 90's, primarily in the west, with it being the first for many, myself included. I'm confident in recommending this game to anyone with the patience to see through its age and for what it hides underneath - a passionate soul, belonging to the artists who made it.

HOO BOY, this game is fucking wild. I went into things fully aware of the FF7 continuity but never having actually played FF7 before. Gameplay isn't anything crazy or new to the series (I personally dislike the Materia system and find it inferior to F6's relic system) but I was not prepared to experience firsthand how bat-shit crazy the series started getting once Tetsuya Nomura started getting involved. Character designs and backgrounds make less sense than ever before and everything is edgy and depressing. Why is it that Hojo's solution to everything is [spoiler]""impregnate it and inject it with Alien juice""[/spoiler]? Why is everyone in this game suicidal? Why does everything and everyone suck? There are cute/funny moments but everything is just so depressing and shitty. I honestly dislike this game but it's such a well-made and iconic game that I can't bring myself to give it a negative rating.

Overall, this was a cool and convenient way to experience the original Final Fantasy 7. I think I got this for $6 which isn't bad for a piece of gaming history. Once I finish my journey of getting all the achievements in every mainline Final Fantasy game I'll explore the FF7 extended universe/spinoff games.

I feel like this game's cheese is common knowledge by now but I ended up soloing both Emerald and Ruby Weapon with the following: [spoiler] (Knights of the Round + HP Absorb) (Counter + Mimic) (Final Attack + Phoenix) (W Summon)
Cloud starts equipped with this Materia setup and his other 2 teammates already dead. At any point dualcast KOTR and then put the controller down and you will automatically win any fight. In the event that Cloud gets KOd he'll revive the entire party with Phoenix [/spoiler]

What can I say about Final Fantasy 7 that hasn't already been said, and been said better.  Nothing.  There's nothing that I can say about this game that you haven't heard before, or heard articulated in a more impressive fashion.  But, that won't stop me from doing it anyway.  If you haven't played this game, I would suggest that you do it as soon as possible.  Try to avoid spoilers as best you can and experience it first hand.  It is well worth it.


More:

Final Fantasy 7 is a great game.  Most of the praise that this game receives is from a group of people who played it when it first released on the PlayStation in 1997.  Their opinion of the game is colored by nostalgia, yet also accurate in most cases.  The game was a success when it first released, and it still holds up today.  In my case, I did not play Final Fantasy 7 back in my middle-school days, I only played and beat the game when I became an adult.  However, I did spend my summers hanging at my friends house, and watching him play through the the entire game several times.  I did attempt to play the demo once, on a PlayStation demo disc, however it did not excite me.  

As a youngin', I had no interest in turn-based RPGs.  It wasn't until I got older that I actually understood how to play them, and became more invested in the story of a game.  Final Fantasy 7 is not a complicated game.  It does have depth in its mechanics, and the actual game-play part of the game is one of the best even to this day, in my opinion.  The story is convoluted, but it's fun and exciting.  It was way ahead of its time.

The music is great, the story is great, the characters are great... you get the idea.  I usually spend some time going into each separate element of the game, but I'm not going to do that here.  I will just say that I don't remember disliking anything about this game.  It has been a while since I rolled credits on FF7, but my memory of the game is one that suggests it was an all around good time.  

One thing I remember about playing this game was being confused.  The feeling of confusion was ever-present during my play-through.  I only got lost once, and did not know how to progress the story, but I was constantly confused about what was going on in the story.  The story is great, but it could have been told better.  Maybe there are things that were lost in translation or something, or maybe the developers wanted players to play the game several times to actually get a grasp on what was happening.  Either way, this is a nit-picky sort of complaint, because I still had a great time with the game.  

If you haven't played this, the original Final Fantasy 7, then just play it.  I think you're going to like it.

-You can't save everywhere at the beginning

It must be the music, which has always been like the benchmark of game music for me. I have had the soundtrack in my casual listening collection for a decade. I think the visual design is the second reason, but in hindsight the graphics are not good by any means, ridiculous at points, if not obviously dated. There is however just this amazing hand drawn scenery and detail put into places which make you believe the world is real, and I still buy into it. The unique setting and story draw me in, well into a play-through in 2023, and I'm enjoying it. I don't think I could enjoy most of the games I played on the PSX, or in the late 90's now. I don't think many of them had particularly good game play anyways (at least not most), but this one is still recommendable today.  
PRO TIP [i]mod related[/i]: [spoiler] Check out ""tsunamods syw launcher"" in a Google search, if you decide to get it installed, here are my settings and why. Check ""60fps Game"" and set the 3D engine to ""Vulkan"" (this got all the animation frame rates stable for me). This worked perfectly for me, also I would recommend turning on all of the ""HD"" textures and ""Real 16/9"". This gives you a easy, on step mod install, to get the whole game running in  HD and at 60fps, nice right! ""Dynamic Lighting"" and the ""Transparent"" text box options are also cool, but they all had some display bugs here or there. Finally ""Hide Models Moths"" and ""PSX Musics"" get you the more original feel. I would not mess with anything else other than turning on ""Steam achievements"" Its a pretty easy all in one graphic upgrade mod which keeps the game nice and original otherwise!

The moment I have been waiting for to show you how much of a fanboy I can be and the moment you have all been waiting for to skip to the last paragraph or the rest of my review due to the excess amount of fanboyism in this review. To those that don't know, Final Fantasy VII is the reason I am a gamer, the reason I fell in love with Role-playing games. I have repeated this game countless amounts of times and I always recount ridiculous stories to my friends of how obsessed I was with it, from losing the original copy of the game and eventually finding a copied version only to hide 5 copies all over my house in case I lose it again, to another story of my brother Hogging the PlayStation from me and playing FFVII Non-Stop, to which I emptied a bottle of water on his PlayStation as revenge. Yes, I was a devil as a kid and a stubborn idiot. But all you had to do was let me play my damn RPGs in peace. I haven't even started to what a masterpiece this was.

I could literally keep on writing as much as I have written up till now but Final Fantasy VII is a very complex game to explore in one review. It is easily one of the best games I have played in my life and is revered as one of the best games of all time. But still, after all that, it is not everyone's cup of tea but for a role-playing game fan, it is a must-have. Final Fantasy VII was remade on the PS5 and the original is already ported and modded on all platforms whether handheld or on PC so it is really tough to miss nowadays. If it is mini-games you want to waste time on or engaging puzzles in convoluted dungeons that you want to get lost in only to succumb to random encounters and fight tough and optional boss fights while customizing your characters to an intricate skill system, Final Fantasy VII is for you. Just beware not to get too involved with it and eventually obsess over it like me in hopes of finding the other games that the developers have created to be as valuable as this game. It is why I called it shitty to begin with simply because it was great once upon a time and eventually became  If it is an anime episode or prequel on the PSP or a spin-off about Vincent, nothing can replace what has already raised the bars to begin with.

There are a lot of reviews about how save files delete. I haven't experienced it..and if I do, I will add to this review and auto-thumbs down the game. 

But to me..FF7 has always been the most mediocre RPG example, that is highly overrated. But it was the big one that was the into for a lot of RPG gamers...and that has always been the problem. It set the standard. I respect that and i see the good in it too.

The game is still an enjoyable experience....so I would still recommend it. (Especially over the new style of RPGs and FF games...ugh.) You can easily drop tons and tons of hours into playing it and enjoy every second. Being cheaper than the remake, it wouldn't hurt to give it a try.

But it does have issues through Steam...especially on the controller end. You will have to set up a layout to even work a controller. And I doubt we will even see an update ever since the focus is on the remake. So 4:3 only.

Square has moved on...but what they missed is that this version has style, it has soul, and it has a lot of things that games today don't and will never have. It may be ""ugly"" but today's graphics standards...but can also be modded to look nicer if you want. Not me...I like the look and feel of it.

Especially if it is your first experience with Final Fantasy

PRO:
The game works perfectly
There are many mods for upscaled textures
Great story
Fun combat system

CON:
But why would I not recommend it? 
QoL issues
The Save point in some areas are almost 1 hour apart. Thanks to cinematics
There are items that can be easily missed which are quite powerful though not necessary to beat the game.

Really frustrating minigames which have cinematics inbetween save points.
So if you want to get a better reward from a minigame - you would need to load a save, watch an unskippable cinematic and try again.

So from a QoL perspective these are major negatives 

If it is your first Final Fantasy Experience 
Final Fantasy 9, 12 are good options
Final Fantasy 15 is great but you should watch the movie Kingsglaive first as it is prequel to the game.

Classics never die but many game mechanics don't work as well anymore.
FF7 is perhaps the JRPG that most influenced the industry and perhaps the most popular (there's a movie, remake, spin off, I think there's an anime prequel...).

For those who don't know FF7 is a JRPG with ATB (Active Time Battle) battle system, it's similar to a turn system the difference is that the turn counter doesn't stop and some turns are faster and others slower it will vary with the enemy, to make it easier to understand, during the battle if I take too long to choose the move I want to use, the enemy can attack me more than once.

A point that has aged, is the encounter of the battles, they are random, you walk around the map and at any moment a battle appears. You do not see enemies on screen, only in the ""arena"" of battle.
The game presents the material system (which are the spells) that you equip in your character and can combine to have new effects: ex: Fire + All you will attack all enemies in the arena with fire. Matters also have an Xp system (called Ap) and can increase or decrease the character's attribute: ex: +10% strength or -10% life. There are also Summons, which are invocations that you can do during battle.

The game is from 1997 and visually, you can't demand a game from 97, the graphics were pretty bad, but with MODs you can leave the game with a very acceptable graphic.
In terms of gameplay, some things were pretty bad, some scenarios are difficult to move around or identify the path correct.
The soundtrack is very striking with beautiful compositions.
The story is quite complex and even confusing at times.

-Mouths: remove them, PS1 ver. did not have mouths, and they're bugged in this version (They are permanently waiting to bite on a glizzy (ºOº) ) having an option in the launcher to remove them or binding this to ""Original Graphic"" option would be cool.

-Censorship: the PS1 ver. was barely censoring the silly words, the first PC port censored everything, and this re-release kinda halfway uncensored it? why not uncensor all of it?

-Framerate: i've seen a lot of forums and pages claiming the frame is worse in this version, it's not; 15fps FMVs 30fps Field and 60fps menu, just like PS1 Ver; you can check yourselves with emulators, but with today's tech, it should not be hard for a huge developer to make the whole thing 60fps without doubleclicking bullsht (excluding FMVs i guess)

-Controller support: it's bad, really bad. adding SDL (for ps controllers ) and a more deep Xinput compatibility should've been a minimum from the start, this time and age and with steam pushing support on their own, it's surprising how bad it is.

that's all i can think right now, pretty sure there is plenty more like deleted stuff. 
if modders where able to partially fix some of this stuff themselves i don't see why the actual developer, with access to every file, source code and all that stuff, should take 10 years to fix them...

I'am really not a fan of the simplified gameplay, and new gameplay mechanics: 

- characters in team are cutted down to 3 from previous 4,
- gameplay is ultra linear, to the point that world map is unnecessary and frustrating,
- getting a chocobo is now a joke, the luring system sucks hard, 

- the story is so badly written, with so many plot twist, that even main characters don't know what's going on and ask cloud to explain what happened to this point and what is the exact goal of this ridiculous journey. And the game does it just to confuse it even more in next 10 minutes. The game can't decide if it's a cyberpunk game or a copy of ""Neverending story"" movie. This is definitely product of it's own time, 90s, and moreover, a japanese game, but it aged very, very badly. 

- There's a lot of unnecessary content, you are forced to play stupid mini games, and sometimes win them to get the plot further. Sometimes there's whole locations, NPCs, buildings, cutscenes, dungeons and everything created just for some stupid side event that doesn't matter at all. Completely waste of time, this game is literally too long because of this.

- Sometimes you are stuck, because of badly designed story. You have to guess where you have to go next, or do next, because game left you sometimes without any hint. 

- Characters are mostly Cheesy, don't expect any good written one. 

- Active camera angles in battle mode are awful. Fortunetly you can turn it off.

- The minecraft Chibi characters are horrible. Who even thught that this is a good idea? It's not even PS1 limitations, because FF8 have normal characters.
 
Materia system is ok, I really like design of locations in FF7, they are great and unique. OST is also good. Overall this game is mid one, but I can't recommend it to anyone, better go play remake. 

PS: Why people in 90s love it so much? I guess that for many millenials FF7 was a first FF ever, and even a first RPG ever. But it doesn't mean it's a fantastic game. All game magazines gave them 10/10, for reason I don't udnerstand, maybe I was born to late to understand 90s mentality. Especially the idea that FF7 is the best looking game on this platform.

One of the greatest games I have ever played, I was very late to the party, I just finished the game today and the ending blew me away.

I decided to drop the steam version in order to play the switch version, I believe the steam version isn't bad but as someone who doesn't play turn based jrpgs much, I found the game without the extra features the console versions received to be a little slow and tedious at times. I believe if the steam version were to be updated with these features, it would have been a much better experience. Still, the game is wonderful and if you don't feel like you need these extra features I believe the steam version of the game should be fine for you.

This game is wonderful, it feels a little dated in some areas while holding up in others. The story was amazing and is the first final fantasy game I have finished (I have tried others but have not completed them). The characters were all written very well, THE SOUNDTRACK WAS GREAT with a good variety of music and perfectly synced with story events to create an atmospheric and emotional link to the game. The graphics for it's time looked mostly good, mainly just character models that seemed the most dated. The gameplay I thought would be a bore but it's not too bad, I don't think it is the games biggest strength though.

I am very excited to try out the remake and also crisis core. But this original version of the game is a must play, and as far as I have heard the original is recommended to play before remake, which is why I played this first. I am 100% satisfied playing this first and I recommend it highly, just again research into what port of the game you would enjoy the most, as I think the steam version should have received these updated features but it did not.

When videogames are delayed for any significant amount of time, they are usually, for some reason, far below expectations. Games like Battlecruiser 3000AD, Ultima VIII, and Stonekeep were all pushed back repeatedly, only to be either incomplete (Battlecruiser) or simply bad (Ultima, Stonekeep). But occasionally, a game comes along that bucks that trend. And in the case of Final Fantasy VII, the latest output from RPG king Square, the end result justifies the delays without question. FF7 is, without a doubt, the new benchmark for console titles. 

To begin with, FF7 is longer than every console RPG to date. The game takes place across 3 CDs. It took Next Generation Online, no stranger to RPGs, a total of 49 hours to complete the game (approximately 25 hours for disc one, 15 for disc two, and 9 for disc three - the majority of which was spent breeding and racing chocobos [q.v.]), twice the length of Final Fantasy VI (known as III in the U.S.) and Wild Arms. While it is possible for the game to be completed in less time, rushing to complete it is definitely not recommended.

Since their last Japanese-translated RPG (Chrono Trigger for Super Nintendo), Square has been known for adding ""easter eggs"" to their games - opportunities for players to learn more about the game's characters, bonus games, and the like. Well, Square has outdone themselves this time. At least three hours are spent uncovering the main character's past, with an additional hour each for several other characters. One of the game's ""secret"" characters has her own hour of backstory, complete with her own town that is not even necessary to visit during the game's normal progression.

What is necessary during the game's normal progression is the capacity for awe. FF7's graphics are light years beyond anything ever seen on the PlayStation, making Wild Arms look like a Yarouze demo (we have nothing against Wild Arms, but FF7 is that good). The game begins in an enormous industrial complex housed in a futuristic city, and remains there for the first seven or eight hours of play. Just when it appears that the entire game will take place in the city, the venue changes to a fully 3D, fully rotatable engine, and players will find that the city is a mere dot on the enormous world map.

When not travelling in the world, players will navigate through static, hand-drawn locales. And in another huge leap forward for RPGs, the corridor is no more. Players can walk in, around, on top of, and through submarines, glaciers, amusement parks, reactors, farms, and dozens of other places. Since the backgrounds are static, the developers were able to put all their attention into animating the iconic representation of the party leader, which is represented in super-deformed polygons, looking remarkably like the Wild Arms characters look in battle.

It is unknown who came up with the idea for the polygonal battles first, Sony or Square, but Square has been in the business longer, and it shows in FF7's combat engine. While only three members can be in the party at one time, the effects more than make up for the game's only shortcoming. The graphics are as ""realistic"" as possible, considering the genre, with each character having a distinct look. And since each character uses a different style of weapon, the animation is different for each character. But it doesn't stop there - each character also has several other attack animations, based on their equipment. The equipping of characters is perhaps the most important part of the game; the game itself devotes several pages of text just to explain it.

The special attacks and spells, however, are the game's strongest points. All nine characters have ""limit breaks"", which can only be used after the character takes a certain amount of damage. When the limit is reached, the character attacks and does extra damage to the target. Each character has at least four, with one having nine.

The spells are the most graphically impressive part of the game (the game's CG sequences run a close second). There are 70 in all, 16 of which are FF3-style summon monster spells. One of these (Leviathan) was in the FF7 demo disc, which may be why the demand for the game has been so huge.

The game's plot is deep and typical of Square's prior efforts quite epic. Square takes great pride in its storytelling abilities and uses a number of flashback sequences, and loads of rendered sequences and prerendered FMV to add greatly to the mood and emotion of the story.

Adult themes and even some uncensored language (Goddamn, Crap, Shit, etc.) were all left in place as per Sony's promise not to alter the work. The teen rating for the game is well deserved due to such mature sexual and violent themes.

All in all, it is impossible to not recommend Final Fanatsy VII to anyone who is even vaguely interested in RPGs.",1686141347,1688924671,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Final Fantasy VII is a touchstone for presentation and storytelling in games, like Metal Gear Solid, Fallout, System Shock 2, and Half Life. This is THE game which brought Japanese RPGs a true mainstream appeal and market in the West.

The core gameplay has (mostly) aged just alright. It rejects having an obtuse and convoluted leveling system (something other Final Fantasies of past and present have had problems with), and just says ""here is materia, you put it on any character and it levels up with you (assuming you use weapons and armor that allow growth)."" This has the double edged sword of being easy to learn, but compromising on some depth other leveling systems have had. Unfortunately the active turn based combat is very simplistic, easy (most of the time), and never introduces any new new mechanics besides some enemy gimmicks. There are some rather useless party members like Cait Sith and Yuffie (besides if you get her Ultimate Weapon early). The combat isn't one of the strong points of FF7 by the standards of today. The game has long battle animations and unskipable cutscenes (which can get really annoying if you die before reaching the next save point). For those that like side quests, there's a decent amount of that with the optional boss fights, party members, summon materia, ultimate weapons, and Chocobo breeding.

The story is pretty strong overall, but not without it's faults. The story fizzles out around the second act before turning things around towards the final act. The main highlight of FF7 is the characters and the themes. All these years later, the main characters still manage to have depth and nuance beneath their appearances. Cloud is much more than being an iconic game character with an equally recognizable weapon. He is a protagonist filled to the brim with layers and a character arc.

The soundtrack is superb, despite it's sound limitations. Bombing Mission, Let the Battles Begin, The Highwind Takes to the Skies, Aerith's Theme, Cosmo Canyon, J-E-N-O-V-A, and One Winged Angel is just a small handful of the great tracks in the game.

No-one made a game about ecology and destroying the planet as beautiful as this, and so well executed.
All characters were made with their quirks, all had their own ideals, and all of their stories are interesting and nicely tied together.

In terms on combat, it took me two years because I got max stats for all the characters. Took me a lot of farming on Midel, got to admit, but the optional bosses were cruel to beat, the story had its fun and silly moments, love stories, sad ones. I mean, that's why it got all the love it could.

And also made an open world game with plenty of interesting things to do, not only grinding, but fun.

Overall I think it deserves its love. 

And I enjoyed the remake, despite some twists on the story.

To be honest I didn't think the story was phenomenal or anything, but it was decent. Enjoyable enough and intriguing enough to get through the game. Just had some boring patches. I liked all of the playable characters, they all have something to them. Can't wait to play the remake so they can be expanded on.

What was phenomenal was the MUSIC. Such great, emotional tunes playing at the right times for the most emotional impact really made the game feel 100x better.
Probably plug in a controller or switch the keybinds around, because some mini games were a pain in the neck with the default keyboard controls.

It's got everything you need to keep you hooked for hours and hours. But I have to say, I sympathize with Shinra Corporation. They are fantastic, incredible people, just like me.

First off, the world-building in this game is tremendous. Midgar, the city where most of the action takes place, is a masterpiece. The towering steel structures, the advanced technology, it's a sight to behold. Shinra Corporation, the backbone of Midgar's progress, deserves credit for creating such an impressive city.

Now, some people might say, ""But Bubble Tea Bunny, what about the Planet and the Mako energy?"" Let me tell you, Mako energy is a game-changer. It powers the entire city, providing jobs and opportunities for hardworking individuals. Shinra is doing an amazing job harnessing this energy to benefit Midgar's economy and the people.

The characters in Final Fantasy VII are fantastic. You've got Cloud, the main character, who may seem like a bit of a downer at times, but he's a winner, believe me. Tifa, she's beautiful, tough, and incredibly loyal. And Aerith, she's got this incredible energy and charm. It's no wonder both Cloud and that Sephiroth guy are after her.

Speaking of Sephiroth, some people might paint him as the bad guy, but let's not forget that he was part of Shinra's elite SOLDIER unit. Shinra gave him the tools to be great, and he's making the most of it. He's ambitious, just like me, and that's something I can appreciate.

The battles in Final Fantasy VII are terrific. The materia system, the limit breaks, it's all tremendous fun. And let's not forget about the chocobos! They're like the best horses you've ever seen, but even better. You can race them, breed them, and it's so much fun. It's a tremendous distraction from the serious stuff.

Now, I know some people will argue that Shinra's methods might be a little extreme, but you know what? Sometimes you have to make tough decisions for progress. And progress is what Shinra is all about. They're creating jobs, advancing technology, and ensuring a prosperous future for Midgar. That's what I call leadership.

In conclusion, Final Fantasy VII is a tremendous game that will keep you engaged from start to finish. Sure, some people might not see eye to eye with Shinra Corporation, but I appreciate their efforts to make Midgar great again. So grab your sword, join the battle, and let's show those anti-Shinra folks what true greatness looks like!

What magic was woven into the programming to addict so many? The answers to those questions are both laughably simple and infinitely complicated. To put it into as compact an explanation as I know how, it is the many powerful and moving themes that interweave to form the game’s tapestry and the masterful way they are threaded. There are plenty of games (and stories in all forms of media) that can and do build their entire narrative on just one of the themes found in this game. To find a game that has so many present at all is a storytelling feat. To have them interweave in perfect harmony from beginning to end and still be as relevant (if not more so) today as at it's initial launch is something several orders of magnitude more impressive and amazing.

[b]CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: 9 (Magnificent) -[/b] As with the main story of Final Fantasy VII, the depth of the characters is what helped in making this game the legend it is. I cannot praise this game enough nor put into words the magic the original development team was gifted when making it. If you have not played it, I strongly suggest you do. The reason I did not give this category an even higher score is that I acknowledge that there are some examples of nonsensical or goofy moments that do not fit character development.

[b]MUSIC: 9.5 (Phenomenal) -[/b] Nobuo Uematsu is and always has been a musical genius. Every soundtrack he has ever touched has been pure magic in one way or another. Final Fantasy VII Remake aside, the original Final Fantasy VII soundtrack may be his greatest ever and if not, easily in the top 3 of all-time. With very rare exception, every track is distinct, unique, and captures the feel of it's corresponding scene to perfection.

[b]VISUAL PRESENTATION: 8.5 (Superb) -[/b] The art style for the original Final Fantasy VII is iconic and unmistakable. 25 years after it's release, this is still true. The art style, level designs, creature designs, use of camera angles, and other aspects are all unique to this game and easily identifiable as such. Just because something is iconic, does not mean that it is 100% good. There are some visual elements to the original Final Fantasy VII that are just...not great. Those are what keep my score in this category from being higher. But we take the good with the bad.

[b]GAMEPLAY: 8.5 (Superb) -[/b] At the time of its release, Final Fantasy VII's version of the tried and true turn based system was revolutionary. Why? The innovation of the Active Time Battle used in previous Final Fantasy titles for use with Squaresoft's first 3D game. Compared to previous titles, it was more robust and allowed for more due to the new environment. It does contain some drawbacks, hence the score I have given. Expect odd lags at random moments and enemies sometimes breaking the system.

[b]CONTENT: 9 (Magnificent) -[/b] In a time long before DLC or even the ability for game consoles to access the internet, game companies had to release completed and bug free games to the public at launch. Given the time period that this game was released in, the amount of content was unheard of. Even by modern standards, the original Final Fantasy VII contains a lot of it, so much so that it was actually a challenge for the Remake development team to incorporate into a modern setting. My one problem here is that there is not enough content for certain parts of the game where more is needed.

[b]GRAPHICS*: 8 (Outstanding) -[/b] As far as I am concerned, graphics are the least important category with regard to immersion. I simply do not see graphics as that important. Trying to even fairly rate graphics feels like an exercise in futility right out of the gate. How does one do that when dealing with titles from across the history of the art? And since mods exist to change graphics so drastically, it is difficult to accurately score this category. I do it based on the time of the game's release to be as fair as I can. At the time, these were state-of-the-art graphics. Still, there are examples throughout the game of poor use of those new graphics. You will see them scattered all across Gaia. If you are willing to delve into the modding universe, you can transform the original version into something that is almost indie modern in quality.

[b]TOTAL (CORE): 9 (Magnificent)[/b]

[b]TOTAL (EXPANDED)*: 8.9 (Superb)[/b]


[b]FUN FACTOR: 9.5 (Phenomenal) -[/b] There are very few games that I can play over and over almost endlessly. Final Fantasy VII is one of them. It is a pure joy to relive this game's magic to me.

You have probably guessed by now that Final Fantasy VII is my all-time favorite game. I will admit that despite my always trying to be unbiased and objective when I score a game, there are times when that is extremely difficult to do. This is absolutely one of those times. No other game has ever touched me or influenced me like this one (Remake not included). I will stand by my opinion that the stars aligned at the right place and time when this game was developed and released. Seeing as how two generations of gamers have had the same experience with this title, it is not entirely my bias at work here.

FF7 set the standard for RPG's that still exists today in the form of cinematic story-telling, massive world-building, large-scale exploration and diversified options for style of game play with lots of side content to optionally enjoy to the player's benefit. 
There are two downsides: 
-the graphics are obviously 1997, but the pre-rendered backgrounds and unique sprite choices does give the game it's own enjoyable quality; just don't worry too much about the hands.
-the game has been argued as ""too easy"" and I would agree for anyone who goes in with a guide or on multiple play-throughs. The difficulty slider is greased towards easy-mode only because once you overcome the materia learning-curve it's possible to nigh-abuse them.... but I argue that the developers thought of that and that's why the game has two mega-bosses. Just don't cheat yourself on the new-player experience and this isn't a problem; you can easily sink over 100 hours into the game learning it's ins and outs. 

I'm very biased, but I know for certain that this game is one of those once-in-a-generation experience that tells a story I think most players can immerse themselves in and enjoy. If it doesn't hold up for you: hey, that's why they made a new one! Cheers! :D

39140,138368677,76561198053753111,748,5,1885,0,1001,1687316078,"FF7 is good (obviously) and is an important milestone in gaming history. If you consider yourself someone who enjoys video games as a hobby, I think you should play this at least once. 

...However, considering this game is now over 25 years old, we should add some pretty big disclaimers to the above statement. 

First and most obvious, the graphics are tremendously dated, and they are dated in that super special way that only early 3D games can achieve. The backgrounds are mostly pretty nice. They are pre-rendered and could potentially fit in a modern pixel game. The character models, however, are just straight up colored blocks. You have to use a fair bit of imagination to immerse yourself. With that being said, I do think they fall into the ""so bad that it's actually good"" category. I found myself amused as Cloud raises his polygon arms to spin the buster blade around. 

On to the story - The story is charming, but can feel tonally weird at times. While FF7 is significantly better than other ""Japanese to English"" titles of the era, it still struggles with not quite matching how a native speaker would approach these situations. For example, there will be tense moments in the game, and the characters meet those moments often with cheesy dialogue or out of place words that someone with a better grasp of the language wouldn't use. It's not enough to ruin the experience, but there are plenty ""what the f@#$ does that mean"" moments.

Lastly, I would say the gameplay is fun and suits the game very well, but is pretty simple - especially when compared to modern turn-based titles. Modern turn-based RPGs, even the modern Final Fantasy titles, has significantly improved and added depth to the genre that you will notice is missing in FF7s combat. This doesn't mean it's bad.

It has everything one could ask for an incredible RPG experience: great characters, memorable music, and a compelling story. It's no wonder this title is held in such high regard; it still stands up to this day even though it was released years ago.

The graphics hold up even better than many modern RPGs. You can really immerse yourself in the environment and the world of FFVII. The battle system is fast and the characters feel like real people, making every battle and cutscene more memorable. Additionally, the game introduces unique gameplay elements and mechanics that you wouldn't find in any other RPG which give it an edge.

The music is some of the best to come out of any video game. Every single battle theme is a classic and the main theme of FINAL FANTASY VII is known all over the world. It's the perfect soundtrack to compliment the stunning visuals and immense scale of the game.

Which makes it no surprise that it's one of the first PSOne RPGs Squaresoft ever ported to the PC during the late 90s. Unfortunately it would also start the trend of terrible and lazy ports which has lasted to this day (Looking at you Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross). 

Notably they've saddled it with peculiarities that make it a nightmare to run on modern systems; To start, you cannot run this game on Fullscreen Mode, it just crashes after the Title Screen. You are thus compelled to run it in a Fixed-Resolution Bordered Windowed mode which you cannot resize at all. Visual settings are moreover non-existent; You have a grand total of three visual options. FMVs always start with a stutter. And to top it off this particular port adds an open mouth to all NPCs, so it looks like everyone, from the shop girl to Sephiroth, is offering you a blowjob. 

It has also a number of non-fatal but nonetheless annoying bugs; Like speed square's targeting sensitivity being maxed out, teleportation glitches and a terrible sound bug in the long chocobo race course. 

Now I am aware that there are mods to address these issues and if you have the time to apply them have at it but honestly a decent port should not have these problems to begin with, which ultimately accounts for my negative rating.

My memories about this game is seeing my older brothers play through most of the game, while I sit on the side watching intently. Like I was watching a movie. Because of this, I didn’t think I would ever play it, cause why should I when I already know what happens?

But Final Fantasy VII is such a game-changer in JRPGs and storytelling in video games, I just couldn’t avoid it. It’s constantly referenced in lists about Top RPGs of all time and the like. Not only that, so many of my social circle adore this. It’s a monument everywhere. 

So, after years of not having any interest in playing it, I one day decided to give it a go. 40 plus hours later and a bunch of failed attempts to demolish the one-winged angel Sephiroth without the Knights of the Round materia, I finally finished Final Fantasy VII. 

And I love it.

I won’t go into details too much about the game mechanics since there’s not much to say about it but I do have some comments on the Steam version (more on this in the next section). 

I won’t divulge a lot about the story too, because either everyone already knows about it. But I also don’t want to spoil anything to anyone who has no idea what FFVII is about and wants to go in blind. Because it will be worth it to go in blind (more on this in the third section).


[b] Steam version would have been flawless if it had features to speed-up the game and turn off random encounters [/b] 

This isn’t exactly a criticism of the game itself, but the version on Steam. There are moments in the game where I wish I could speed things up like when walking a long path or while on the world map. Random encounters are standard in Final Fantasy games, but perhaps a feature to switch them off would be a good update.

It isn’t that big of a deal. But these days, as someone who has to work, I don’t have the privilege of time to grind (main reason why I skipped some of the side quests, fighting the other Weapons, and breeding chocobos to get the Knights of the Round materia). I also know that there are mods to do these, but I’m too lazy to do that, so that’s on me. And besides, random encounters make the game more exciting.

In the end, it doesn’t make the game per se anything less than amazing. 

[b] Memorable characters with compelling backstories in a fascinating world that's worth fighting for [/b]

Advocacy of environmentalism that fight against large corporate greed is a tried and tested formula for a good plot. But I think what makes Final Fantasy a true classic is its ensemble cast. Almost everyone has an interesting backstory. Cloud, Tifa, Barrett, Cid, Sephiroth, Hojo, the Turks, Bugenhagen, and many more. The world they inhabit has so much depth and lore that it’s worth digging deep into, and truly makes you want to fight for it. 

The solid storytelling of VII is also a testimony on why it’s revered. Being such an influential game and a cultural phenomenon back when I was younger, I’ve been aware of the main plot lines of this game for years — including the big reveal about Cloud (I won’t spoil anything for anyone who hasn’t played the game). But seeing it play out still gave me chills. So, if you’re not familiar with the events here, keep it that way. Trust me, it’s worth going in blind.

Furthermore, there’s just so much to do here. I have some memories of my brother playing minigames and side quests especially in the Golden Saucer area. But I’ve been a bit overwhelmed to see how much variety and content it has. The different minigames, side quests, and activities you can do in all the interesting locations across the map immerse you into its fascinating world. 

[b] Conclusion [/b]

I didn’t think I would one day bother playing Final Fantasy VII again. It’s just so ubiquitous in gaming. And when it’s as influential as it is, your expectations are just so high. Not only that, since so many of the people I know consider this as one of their favorite games, I did feel at some point I was getting overhyped. 

But Final Fantasy VII lives up to its legacy. I dare say as well that even playing it vanilla, it’s still one hell of an JRPG. 

On top of that, it comes with a compelling message: the world is worth protecting because of who we love in it. Authentic without being self-important. Critical but not preachy. 

There is a reason why this is considered a classic. And it deserves to be considered as such.

And before anyone taps your shoulder and says ""just buy this on sale so you can use to files to run Echo-7"" let me tell you a little something the Final Fantasy fandom won't: Echo 7's idea of a 'good fan voice' for Cloud was to make him sound like Derek Zoolander. I legitimately am going to start the game over and voice the characters myself on stream. 

Any sort of narrative gravitas has been undermined by the fact Cloud - who already has to overcome the stereotypical Bad Boy With Amnesia tropes - sounds like a Ben Stiller character. The fan translation (or perhaps just bad rewrite of the existing FF7 translation?) is abysmal, inserting swearing in places that genuinely feels it's there for shock value. A real ""this isn't your momma's Final Fantasy"" vibe that sincerely does not fit the tone of the game in the slightest.

Add on the fact Barret is not voiced by a Black guy and it is VERY APPARENT, and you've got a recipe for disaster. I respect the passion of all the fans who made Echo-7 but impact outweighs intent and the impact is there is one mod that EVERYONE suggests getting for this game and it retroactively makes the game feel like if Snapcube made a Final Fantasy 7 dub. 

If you do get this with intention of modding, just use some QOL mods to make it run right and enable controller use. Skip Echo-7.

Without mods, this is a port that needed polishing in 2013 when it dropped and CERTAINLY needs work now. The whole POINT of Final Fantasy 7: Remake is they presume you've played the original, yet the only legal way to play the original is this old-ass feeling port that was antique-feeling when it launched.

Come on, Square. Try. For once. It builds character.",1684560844,1684561027,False,2,1,0.444875359535217285,0,True,False,False

+ Game still holds up mechanically; game encourages build variety with equipment and materia setups
+ Characters are likable and entertaining
+ Soundtrack is amazing, even though it's midi
+ Has the healthiest modding community out of all the FF games, adds replay value

Cons:
- Game is still not great to look at; visual presentation is off putting but your mileage may vary.
- Translations can sometimes be a miss, some scenes read sillier than others
- Plot may be confusing to some people, definitely has some unnecessarily convoluted story beats, but not that many
- Combat can be very repetitive and boring after awhile, this is common for a lot of FF games and Japanese-developed RPG's at the time

I would recommend to anyone who's enthusiastic for old games. If you don't mind PS1 era graphics and presentation, I would definitely recommend.

Despite the game being over two decades old, it still holds up today and is a testament to its incredible storytelling and gameplay.

One of the new features that stood out to me in the Steam version was the addition of achievements. As someone who enjoys collecting achievements in games, it was satisfying to see the list of challenges to complete and track my progress. It added a new layer of motivation to explore the game even further.

Another improvement in the Steam version was the FMVs (Full Motion Videos). While the game's graphics and backgrounds are still in their original format, the FMVs have been enhanced to look much better than the original. The added details and clearer picture quality added to the overall immersive experience of the game.

The Steam version of Final Fantasy VII provided me with a chance to relive one of my favorite childhood games and gave me an opportunity to experience the game in a new way with the addition of achievements. The game still holds up incredibly well today, and the enhanced FMVs help immerse players even further into the world of Midgar.

Is this the best Final Fantasy? I can't tell you that, but it sure is the most popular!
Few titles are worth calling a masterpiece. Fewer among them become a mainstream masterpiece, like FFVII achieved.

Why FFVII is a [b]must-play[/b] title:
-Story-wise, this game is ever-relevant to today with it's allegory of draining our planet to produce more energy. It really hits home and you should experience this feeling for yourself! 
-You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies, which makes Cloud awesome by default. The game is presented by an unreliable narrator and how this twists and turns the story (+your heartstrings too) and events that happen is something that is more than unique. It is the very definition of Entertainment.
-Sephiroth is a unique villain, which can make you admire and feel sorry for him for at the same time (+his music score is lit!).
-Although I am a job system fan, the Materia system is super strategic, deep and pure fun to mess with.

I can just go on and on but everything really is on-point here! Villains, backstories, music, game systems. It all comes together to bring you a fantastic title. 

If you want to learn more about the setting, look into:
-CRISIS CORE –FINAL FANTASY VII– REUNION on Steam which takes place in the past, and plays like an action-based version of FFVII.
-Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children (Anime movie anyone?) It's really good CGI!
-Dirge of Cerberus -Final Fantasy VII: You can get this to run on a PS2 Emulator, it's some effort and the weakest of my recommendations, so do what you will with it.

If you've played this game before, and are feeling the nostalgia now, go ahead! The only problem is that you will likely hate this release if you use controllers.
If you are thinking to give this game a first try, this is possibly the most mainstream starting point. I would argue you should first try to play this title, and only after that try the Remake!
If you plan to 100% this game, I usually recommend the achievement guide posted by lylat on Steam, but in this case I cannot. The reason is that ""Missable Achievement"" guides should be burned with fire. Especially on a game like this, there are very hard to get ""Non-Missable"" Achievements, that are just plain obscure to find. I would recommend to follow any full guide instead. This will net you all Steam Achievements too with the exception of the money and Materia Exp. ones, which are just pure grind either-way!

I hope I was able to provide some unique perspective for you, and was able to help you decide whether you should play this game if you were on the fence!

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

My only real issues with this port though, are:
* You need a Square Enix Account in order to even play the game, as Steam launches the Launcher for the game and not the game itself (which is easily avoided if you plan to mod or just launch the game outside of steam)
* The sound quality is worse than what I've seen on PlayStation consoles, they sound really compressed.
* The graphics and backgrounds, being upscaled from a PS1 game can be a little blurry/ugly coming from the port, again, not really that hard to fix since games on PC are easily moddable these days. It's not Persona 3 Portable sort of bad, but it's still pretty noticeable, especially the cutscenes where the character models are on-screen.
*Unlike the other Final Fantasy ports (particularly FFVIII and FFIX) on Steam or consoles, (since FFVII was ported earlier than the other games) it doesn't have tools to help newcomers to the older titles, making it less approachable to them, personally I don't have a problem since I'm familiar with the older games, but having the console and steam releases being different than each other seems weird.

9/10

Pros
- Great cast of characters. FF7 has some of the most popular video game characters ever created.
- Materia system is extremely fun. You get a lot of room for creativity and customization. I played various traditional JRPG's and the materia system is my favorite, no contest.
- Story, while not the most amazing, is very good.
- Excellent music.

Cons
- Outdated graphics and controls. Higher res pre-rendered backgrounds, true analog controls, and auto run would have been nice improvements.
- Inability to skip story scenes and summons. These can really drag the game down.
- Getting 100% can be quite grindy.
- Controls are all messed up. You have to use steam's controller features for the game to function properly.
- The battle menu isn't particularly responsive. Supposedly, it now runs at only 15 FPS.
- The SE launcher is unnecessary. I lost my saves multiple times using its cloud saves.",1595278563,1682845139,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think probably one of the worst aspects of these old squeenix games (and retro games in general) that we forget about today is that they're definitely not great compared to more modern games (and I'm really not just talking about graphics -- look up the mechanics and countless bugs for Steal in EVERY FF game before 9), and we look back at them with rose-tinted glasses because they were so core to our formative experiences. It's so hard to hold them accountable because of how new as a medium gaming is. People say Seinfeld isn't funny anymore, without realizing that it's not funny anymore because of how many modern sitcoms have aped their formula or in some cases stolen their jokes and done them better. These landmark games are so core to the industry now that we forget how novel they were, or never experienced it at all, when we see their descendants today.

Which is why I recommend SYW, Reunion and New Threat if you're gonna buy this game; I think mods and ROM Hacks have breathed a ton of new life into these janky old games -- FF6 T-Edition or MaternalBound or the utterly relentless swathes of Pokemon Game Boy & GBA hacks are just the beginning of a long list of creative, fan-driven efforts to remind people WHY these games are so well-loved. There's countless good ideas in this game, and the SYW, Reunion & New Threat mods do everything in a very talented, dedicated trio of team's power to bring those ideas to the forefront and let you experience them for the first time all over again. Upscaled textures, cleaner models, revamped mechanics, optional, accurate retranslations, a heated effort to make sure *every* Materia has some useful function, and even rearranged story events that let you skip tedious garbage (or still do it! you can if you want to!) all come together to make this the freshest old-ass RPG I've played in years.

After playing it i can say that if you enjoy turn-based rpgs, especially old-school ones, and wish to play an older game with a big impact in the genre, then this game is quite the good choice. Now, I will talk more in-depth about the game:

Visuals: As it is to be expected of a 1997 game, the visuals are quite outdated, the characters outside of battle being in a sort of weird chibi style and some of the background being still images. Although this might scare some people away, I do believe the graphics are quite appealing and it won't be a problem for people used to older games. Besides, a lot of cutscenes (story and summons especially) are still really cool and well-made.

Gameplay: As already mentioned, the combat is turn-based and I believe it does its job quite well. The combat offers a lot of variety, which i believe is really important in a turn-based game. The main way of offense and defense is materia. Materia are items that you can equip on the character, thus giving them the ability to use offensive spells, healing spells, new commands and all sorts of useful stuff. There are also limit breaks, basically the characters ultimates, which can be used after taking a certain amount of damage. But materia also lowers some of the characters stats when equipped, so they must be managed carefully. Outside of combat, there are a lot of items to pick up, some hidden in the overworld and others obtained through minigames. There are also two optional characters you can obtain. Another thing to notice is that some of those things are really hard to find without the help of a guide, so the usage of one is recommended. In terms of difficulty, it varies a lot. A lot of common enemies and bosses aren't that hard, but certain enemies and bosses can be really challenging, especially when you do not have access to the stronger materias and limit breaks.

Story: The story has some really good characters and plot, with themes like identity, loss and environmentalism. I did not find it the best story I ever saw, not even close to it, but it is good, and it is most certainly a classic and deserves the praise it receives.

P.S. Another thing to take into account is that you will need a SE account to play it, and if i remember correctly, you won't be able to play it if the servers are not online. Quite the bold choice to put those restrictions in a 26 year old game but I think its still worth it.

It's still a classic for a reason.

While the graphics and audio quality have not held up at all, it's amazing how much of the core experience still lands. I expected to struggle completing this game, but the narrative themes and characters are so strong that I quickly got over the aesthetics. The soundtrack is top-notch. The world design is iconic. The pacing and story-telling is some of the best in the series.

This is Final Fantasy firing on all cylinders.

[u]Positives[/u]:

- This is such a rich story.  All of the characters have unique, interesting conflicts that work on their own while building on larger narrative themes.  Is it still a goofy, contrived anime at points?  Yes, but it’s a really good one that you’ll think through later and appreciate fully.

- The world of FF7 is so unique and imaginative.  Midgar is such an iconic landscape that they keep revisiting in later games and movies.  There are so many little world details you notice in optional content that fleshes everything out.  The characters and world design are what caused this game to lodge in so many people’s brains.

- I feel like the pacing and structure of this game don’t get enough credit.  The story rarely drags.  The first few hours are brisk and get you immediately invested.  There are so many “big reveal” moments that, frankly, the remake completely drops the ball on.  You are missing out if you don’t play the original.

- Some top-tier Nobuo Uematsu music.  I love that the overworld theme (Cloud’s theme) changes throughout the game to reflect the current mood of the story.  I was pumped as f*** watching blocky, 90s-era characters glide around a 2D background because the music is impossible not to feel in your bones.

[u]Negatives[/u]:

- Let’s get it out of the way.  The graphics and audio quality is a** 25 years later.  When I first booted up the game and heard the wimpy *pmphf* a character’s punch made, I turned the game off.  It’s a major turn off for the game that you eventually get over.  What’s beyond the technical fidelity is well worth it, though.

- I remember loving the mini-games as a kid and now I can’t stand them.  They are so slow and tedious.  I fast tracked Fort Condor as much as I could.  Like later FF ports, this would really benefit from a speed up option.

I originally played FFVII on the PS1 during the pandemic and it left a huge impact on me. I bought the port on sale hoping to get all the steam achievements and complete the game since I missed a lot of side quests on my first run through. However, I don't think I'll be doing that. In my opinion, the issues this port has are deal breakers for me. The controls are difficult to set up properly for a gamepad and there is some amount of input lag that I can't get rid of. The lag is most noticeable in battles, ideally you want to have quick menuing to get an action in before your opponent and the lag can make menus feel clunky at times. The graphics in battles occasionally have some issues being emulated properly too (like certain special effects and the HP/MP bars). I'm overlooking issues with the game itself (like the run button and lower framerate etc.) because those issues exist in the original release and other console ports for the game. Personally, I would rather replay my physical copy than the windows port even if it means missing steam achievements.
If you've never played FFVII and you enjoy RPGs, I would still recommend you play this at some point. Just maybe consider a different port or the original release.",1681835366,1681840363,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still giving it a thumbs up as I was able to at least tolerate the dated battle system (though it had really overstayed its welcome by the time I got to the Northern Cave), but I think having played this will make the me appreciate the remake when I get around to trying it.

Not ashamed to admit that I finally completed this game more than 20 years after loading it up for the very first time on my cousins' PS1. I have just finished the ending FMV and the rescue of the planet was a gratifying visual treat. 

It is my view that Nobuo Uematsu's musical talent contributed at least 60% to the success of this game. The 2D pre-rendered backgrounds were beautifully drawn for its time, but the soundtrack perfectly encapsulated the atmospherics of the game. I mean, who can forget the combat themes that get your heart pumping or even the area themes for Mako Reactor, Shinra Building, and Cosmo Canyon? Listening to Aerith's Theme again instantly transported me to the exact moment when I was 9 and first encountered her undeserved ending. Seeing it now was just as traumatic and impactful as it was back then. Fighting Sephiroth while One Winged Angel was playing in the background sent goosebumps all over me. I tried to listen to the FF7 Remake OST but I still preferred the original OST for its simplistic execution but punchy motifs. 

Putting my nostalgia aside, I strongly recommend people to play this game for its interesting characters (they all have poignant backstories), an overarching plot that enthralls you and of course the memorable soundtrack. Gameplay is old-fashioned turn-based combat. If you like it you like it. If you don't, well just slog through it. The main story can be completed fast if you don't care about grinding optional achievements. But be sure to play it with mods because the original polygonal art honestly doesn't hold up well in the eye of a modern gamer.

That said, this 2012 PC version shouldn’t be played without some mods installed to improve the experience[/code]

[i]Final Fantasy VII[/i] is a game with such influence and legacy that I don’t feel like I need to explain what it is. As of January 2023, the game has sold [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII#Sales]over 14.1 million units across all platforms[/url] (!), [url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/final-fantasy-vii]received high praise[/url] and [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilation_of_Final_Fantasy_VII]received numerous spin-offs[/url] under the “Compilation of Final Fantasy VII” brand - from a CGI movie sequel to games (even a [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII:_The_First_Soldier]F2P Battle Royale one[/url]!) to books. One might cynically say that publisher Square Enix is still heavily benefiting from milking the [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i] name but on the other hand, there does seem to be an audience for this cross-media universe – otherwise it wouldn’t have lasted for so long.

Which begs the question, especially with the release of the long-awaited [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/]Final Fantasy VII Remake[/url]: Is there any reason to still play this version of the original 1997 game? The answer to that question is yes, sorry. There are two simple reasons for that. First, the [i]Final Fantasy VII Remake[/i] is only the first part of a planned trilogy, so playing that would only cover a fraction of the original game. Second, the [i]Final Fantasy VII Remake[/i] is aimed at fans who already played the original game and consequently introduces various story deviations to keep them on their toes. So yes, the Remake doesn’t replace the original [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i] - which leaves us with this 2012 PC port of the game.

First of, let me voice my disappointment here: [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i] received a re-release on PS4, Xbox One, Switch and the Microsoft Windows Store (?!), which is [url=https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_version_differences#PlayStation_4,_Xbox_One,_Windows_10,_Nintendo_Switch]based on this 2012 PC version sold on Steam[/url]. These re-releases include new features, like a 3x Game Speed Mode, an option to turn battle encounters off as well as a “Battle Enhancement Mode” (max out HP/MP/Limit at the press of a button). I would’ve loved to see these features added to this Steam version as well, considering how they’re especially helping those who just want to experience the best part of [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i] – the story.

Anyhow, as the PC version we’re stuck with on Steam is from 2012, there are thankfully numerous mods out there to improve the experience. I advise checking the [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_(2012)]PCGamingWiki[/url] for more information but I’ll briefly list my recommendations here. First of, there’s [url=https://www.ff7.live/features.html]The Reunion[/url], a mod which offers numerous improvements. Most notably, it offers a relocalization of the game, improving upon the notably bad translation the game got in the West, as well as allowing for 60 FPS during battle scenes (instead of 15 FPS without mods). This mod does disable Steam achievements unfortunately, though you can unlock those manually through the [url=http://www.blackchocobo.com/]Black Chocobo[/url] save editor. Additionally, I installed a mod for [url=https://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=20311.0]upscaled backgrounds[/url], and one for an [url=https://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=20234.msg283477#msg283477]HD UI[/url]. Lastly, I recommend using a program called [url=https://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=14194.0]Ochu[/url], which offers multiple features (like invincibility), though I mainly used it in order to save anywhere in the game, not just at the save points.

To be clear here, these mods can only do so much. [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i] was the first [i]Final Fantasy[/i] to feature 3D graphics instead of 2D pixel art – and while those 1997 PS1 graphics might’ve turned heads back in the day, they’re far from pretty in 2022. Early 3D graphics just didn’t age as well as those SNES sprites, unfortunately. Thankfully, the same can’t be said for the rest of [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i].

Let’s briefly talk about the gameplay first. The “Active Time Battle” system makes a return, though it has received an addition with “Limit” bars – once filled, your characters can unleash an especially powerful attack. Those are nice to look at and a pleasure to unlock, though getting the best limit levels for every character takes way too long. Magic returns in form of “Materia”, which can be equipped in limited slots of weapons and armor.

Personally, I don’t like the Materia system. The benefit here is that powerful spells can easily be swapped to different characters, which is great. My problem here is that each Materia must be levelled in order to make those spells more powerful (Thunder -> Thundara -> Thundaga, for example) and you can’t buy “powered-up” versions in stores. So apart from character levels and limit levels, you might also need to grind Materia in order to succeed in battle. Summons return as well, also in form of (upgradeable) Materia – and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t8yQ47qvQI]really sweet cutscenes[/url].

Overall though, the general gameplay works as well as it previously did – though party size went down from four to three characters. There’s an overworld, random encounters, dungeons and bosses. [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i] also introduces several minigames as part of the journey, which are a nice little distraction. Also included is various optional content, however, this unfortunately once again includes entire party characters like in [i]Final Fantasy VI[/i]. I recommend using [url=https://jegged.com/Games/Final-Fantasy-VII/]a guide like this one[/url] to make sure you won’t miss out on them as they’re once again somewhat obtuse to unlock.

I’ll be honest here though, I feel like the star of and the reason for [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i]’s ongoing popularity are the characters and overall story. As the first 3D [i]Final Fantasy[/i], the story presentation here is above and beyond what [i]Final Fantasy VI[/i] could offer with its technical limitations. Now there are long scenes filled with nothing but dialogues and FMV cutscenes, instead of battles every 30 seconds. Characters develop and receive interesting backstories, the villain is almost as well known as the hero today and the world itself full of memorable locations. 

Admittedly though, this isn’t the verdict I reached after my first playthrough on Nintendo Switch. Back then, I was mostly confused about how a story like this would go on to become so popular. I feel like the improved translation of the Reunion mod really did wonders for me here, as my second playthrough allowed me to appreciate its characters and world much more (though the game would’ve benefitted from an epilogue), even though it’s still [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPE-Ivy9LLg]occasionally goofy[/url] (spoilers!).

In conclusion, [i]Final Fantasy VI[/i] still holds up today – mostly thanks to its story and characters (<3 the Turks). Parts of the gameplay and especially the graphics haven’t aged as well, unfortunately, though there are mods to help with that. For those with little time and/or those not wanting to deal with Materia frustrations, I honestly recommend just playing through the game with “invincibility” enabled through Ochu in order to enjoy the story. I wish the Remake would’ve been more faithful in order to provide the same experience with better gameplay and graphics but alias, this modded PC version of the 1997 original game is the second-best option right now.",1680378751,1680387068,True,27,0,0.739089131355285645,3,True,False,False

If you've heard of video games, you've heard of FF7. This was my first time playing through it, and I can finally understand why that's the case. For it's time, FF7 is a masterwork of storytelling and spectacle, especially considering the limitations of its engine and hardware. It was incredible to see the level of cinema Squaresoft were able to achieve with the adorably quaint low-poly models and slipshod FMVs. The story itself was great, with a compelling cast of characters who all brought a different interesting aspect to the table (except Cait Sith), and some truly great and unexpected twists. I especially apreciated the aesthetic of the game, opening in an old-school cyberpunk slum, before gradually revealing that the rest of the world is much larger, and mostly untamed. The effect of leaving Midgar and seeing the huge map before me is not one I think will be replicated anytime soon. Also present is a great sense of progression in the way you traverse the map, from hoofing it town-to-town to riding chocobos and later flying, there's a notable sense of increasing freedom in traversal. The gameplay is standard Final Fantasy ATB; not my favourite, but it serves its purpose well, and the camera angles and sense of scale the 3D models brought added a much-welcome bombast to combat. Music is, of course, beautiful, though I will admit to experiencing some whiplash, moving from the iconic orchestral renditions of these famous tracks to the original PS1 soundfont. Though I have only good things to say about this game, I am judging it by the standards of when it released, and to say it's aged poorly would be an understatement. While it surely must have been a 9/10 when it released, I give my experience with it a 7.5/10. That said, its must-play status remains. If you haven't somehow experienced the original FF7, I urge you to do so, be it via a playthrough of your own or a walkthrough on YouTube.

I did not want to recommend it initially, but to be honest, given the price and the amount of content and the love that the developers poured into it, I will give it a recommendation. 

I played FF7 right after finishing FF6 and all the previous ones, in order. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
 - Enough content to keep you busy
 - Varied content: Battles, special battles, vehicles, mini-games, story, cinematics, etc.
 - It is a Final Fantasy and it evolves the series (meaning, it fits in with the previous)
 - Tifa is hot and was my girlfriend
 - The music is not bad but not always good.
 - The concepts are interesting (Materias, permanent stat incr. potions, flexible magic)
 - The characters are alive and interact and have side-quests and are 3d animated.

Cons:
 - The mini-games are boring: Especially breeding, racing, mating Chocobos.
 - Some mini-games are not optional, you need to win to progress the story.
 - The music is annoying in the Gold Saucer.
 - The 3d ""Maps"" are sometimes difficult to navigate.
 - The 3d ""Maps"" (aka Dungeons or Towns) are not beautiful. Like old 3d with awful textures.
 - The animations are very long (during battles).
 - Cinematics cannot be skipped.
 - There are some bugs, such as mastering the Underwater materia
 - The num. of items you can wear on your characters was reduced. Now only Weapon, Armor and Acc.
 - Only 3 characters in your party, and I think more is better. I liked Baldur's Gate 6 characters in your party.
 - Some bosses are not inspiring (the Turks) and I miss the ones of the previous entries.
 - Equipping, unequipping, switching the materias was long between characters.
 - The popularity of this game is mostly due to an enormous publicity and marketing campaign. Many RPGs are bigger, better, have better systems.
 - 168h to finish the game (full completion) was not long. Pathfinder Kingmaker is at 800h and still counting. But Pathfinder Kingmaker is long.

The game can feel similar to Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR), where you also control a party and take 2 team members with you as you venture out of your ship on various planets. But KOTOR had classes with specific skills, skills trees, Light and Dark side alignment and its effects. It also had weapon customization with lightsabers. The mini-game in KOTOR is called Pazak and is a ton of fun. You can travel between planets and it is a bit of an open galaxy. Also, KOTOR is set in the future (not medieval), just like FF7. 

So comparing both, I much prefer KOTOR. It came out 5 years later, roughly, so it is not fair. But if I had to replay one of those two games today, I would pick KOTOR for sure. And this time I would do a playthrough with dark-side aligned sith lord! UNLIMITED POWAAAAA!  This is a level of replayability which is not found in FF7. 

I liked FF7 but it is not great.",1678039955,1678291247,True,0,0,0.392857134342193604,0,True,False,False

Final Fantasy VII is without a doubt the best and most impactful game I have ever played. This behemoth of a game released over 25 years ago has stood the test of time and no other game has come close to dethroning its sheer quality in both gameplay and storytelling alike.

A bit of background knowledge about me. Due to my bad experiences and disinterest in the Pokemon franchise. I grew up hating the form of combat labelled 'turn based'. I thought it was slow, dis-interesting and created a barrier between the user and the combat due to its slow and strategy based gameplay. However, this game has completely reformatted my opinion on turn based combat and it single-handedly made me fall in love with it. Whether I was fighting normal enemies out in the wilderness, or even facing off with Sephiroth in the final battle, I was completely absorbed in the gameplay and combat at every moment.

And the soundtrack is just mesmerising, Nobuo Uematsu gives it his all in creating both incredibly moving and tense scenes through his stellar composition, which helped raise the quality of this game to the very max.

The characters are honestly the best I have seen in a videogame. Instantly I was pulled in to these characters lives, relationships and personal stories and each character gets their own time to shine. Especially Cloud, the main character of this game. Starting out as a stoic, unlikable former soldier who only partakes in helping our main characters for money, eventually turns out to have a beautiful redemption story and has one of the most well crafted character arcs I have seen.

A true masterpiece, everyone should play this game at least once in their life as it is a beautiful and truly unforgettable experience.

The story is extremely complex and the game goes on for potentially hundreds of hours. 

But my main recommendation? Don't stop here. Don't only play FF7. Play FF6, 9, 10, 12, 1,2,3,4,5,8, tactics. Crisis Core, Dirge of Cerberus.

Now, if you know absolutely nothing about final fantasy. You should know that you don't need to play FF1 to play FF2. They're all their own individual stories with their own individual worlds. There's some discussion over whether some final fantasies share the same world. But ultimately, that's very much a fringe element of the games.

Final Fantasy VII is a favourite among many players. Some argue six, some argue nine, some argue ten. (My favourite is four... or nine... or ten... or six... it's tough to choose, sorry!) But ultimately, they're all awesome!

This final fantasy starts you of as an ecological terrorist, taking out reactors that are draining energy from the planet to fuel greedy needs. Sure this grants many people more comfortable lives. But ultimately the damage to the planet will go to far, especially at the rate that SHINRA are draining Mako from the planet. You start with Cloud, before getting more awesome party members and even a few optional party members that are hidden. You'll get to experience Square Enix (or Back then, Squaresoft!) and their attempt at the time to make the old turn based combat system more exciting. It's super easy to get in to, whilst still offering a few challenging battles. Don't worry, if it's too hard, you can grind out a few levels!

Now, we've mentioned the story and the gameplay... but there's an important part that every final fantasy has in spades, and does extraordinarily well!
The Soundtrack. Final Fantasy games have phenomenal soundtracks. You can find full scale orchestras blasting them on youtube. Extremely talented musicians poured their hearts and souls into the music behind these games. FF7 is certainly no exception to that!

The cost is cheap, this game is really cheap. You might look at the graphics and think they've not aged well, but for their time the cinematics were really cutting edge. Few games from FF7's era matched the wonder, Soul Reaver and Ocarina of Time come to mind. But FF7 holds it's unique charm. The general gameplays graphics are considerably less advanced than the cinematics, but they still hold up quite well. (Apart from the bug where all the mouths are constantly open, I believe you can turn that off, it's part of the remaster, it does look funny though!) 

This game is extremely cheap for what it is. A wonderful story, with an excellent soundtrack and awesome gameplay. That could last for over 70 hours in one playthrough. Depending how many bonus things you're going for you could take longer. (If you're as slow a reader as I am, it'll be even longer still!)
And if it's your first final fantasy, you'll find roughly this quality from them all. From FF10 onward you have voice acting. (Before anyone says it's bad, it's quite good, it doesn't sync up perfectly because it was designed for another language. The voice actors themselves are very talented. John DiMaggio for instance, the voice of Bender, does Wakka)
Other games also have unique gameplay, FF3, 5 and tactics, for instance, have awesome job systems. FF10-2 has a job system too! So if you don't want your character to be a wizard, you can make them a warrior (Or a pop star XD Yes, really) FF12 onward change the turn based combat. I'm partial to turn based, but many people prefer the alternative.

Then you also have other games that follow a similar Genre, Blue Dragon, Breath of Fire, Lost Odyssey, Dragon Quest and many MANY more. 

So do consider buying this, start your journey today. If you don't like Final Fantasy 7, don't be disheartened, maybe Final Fantasy 9 is more for you. Or 10... well... there's a lot!

I hope you take the chance, and have a lovely day regardless, Kupo!",1677305581,1677305581,True,61,1,0.837922573089599609,2,True,False,False

Now do not get me wrong i Loved the remake, especially the way they twisted the story to tell a new version of, a version that is more in spirit of the original in how they intented to make it, rather than the last ditch rush for release. FF7 the original is an unfinished title, some of the story got axed and without going into spoilers, just know that the new remake is indeed more in spirit of what the original was suppose to be. So do not sell the remake short it is great, not so much a fan of the action RPG take, but I can handle it.

Regardless, the original FF7 has a good story, even if some parts of it got axed due to release pressure, old time JRPG combat style which makes you able to relax rather than button mash like a crazy person, polygon characters that only your imagination can perfect. So yeah, for nostaliga purposes it is a gem, for new fans wanting to know what the hype was about then you need to set your graphic hungry brain in neutral and just let your imagination play with the polygons like I did as a kid.

Anyhow, It will always have a special place in my heart as the shared top spot in my heart for FF titles, which it shares with FF6, any title after 7? (aside for the remake that is) are a horrible mess of blergh.
Anyone that tells me Zidane or Tidus was that bomb, or Squall for that matter, should wash their mouth with SOAP! Cloud and Terra those were proper MC characters. Squall is a weak Cloud clone, Zidane is Locke (from FF6) with a tale, Tidus is a mix of Cloud and Locke so no... those titles are not good at all, watered down clones of better titles.

Anyhow, Enjoy it if you can.",1677231647,1677231647,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

- Lack of challenge (even with mid-tier self-imposed challenges such as Materia Lockdown)
- No random loot other than (usually worthless) steals and battle drops
- Linear story with few side-quests and optional content, no branching or open sections whatsoever in any meaningful way
- One or more mandatory party members for the majority of the game
- Simple battle system (fights last 1 minute on lowest battle speed, resource management is semi-trivial in multiple ways)
- Literally one fourth of the 40-hours game-length is button-mashing through dialog cutscenes - 10 full hours of sheer fun!

Which is a genuine shame because with 9 party members; a free-form job system in the form of materia; and even a battle arena and mini-game casino in the game... you'd think all the pieces are there already for the ultimate infinitely-replayable (if a little casual) JRPG!

The funny thing is, as fantastic and groundbreaking as this game is, it's not even the best in the series! YEAH YOU HEARD ME YOU PLEBS, not even the best. The #1 spot in the long-running FF series is reserved for FF6 or perhaps FF9, depending on how my day is going or if Mercury is in retrograde.

Okay back to FF7, some hot takes:

Cait Sith is underrated.

Vincent, while super cool as an idea, is very overrated.

Tifa, while a total babe, looks ridiculous as a martial artist. She looks like a girl that shoots tiktok videos and reviews exotic candy while cosplaying on her onlyfans. Tifa, to me, would be ripped and a touch muscular, with all of the kicking and flipping she's supposed to be doing. Those heavies she's smuggling around would really just get in the way of all the ass kicking.

A young player identifies with Cloud, but a real sign of becoming an adult is growing up and identifying more and more with Cid and Barrett.

Red XIII is the bestest boi. 

Cloud was a trans ally long before most of us were.

""Oppressed People"" from the OST is still total banger.

This game, and *THE SCENE* (if you know, you know), may be responsible for a whole generation of men (and some ladies, non-binary, humanoids) experiencing real heartbreak and loss wayyyy too early, resulting in trauma reverberations in adulthood. THANKS FF7, THANKS SEPHIROTH YOU FKIN MONSTER. Think of the money on therapy we all could have saved!? #flowergirls

With the exception of NHL 1999 and a PS1 port of Space Invaders, it's the first video game I ever owned. Certainly, it’s the first one I ever bought for myself, and the first one I properly ‘played’. 7-year-old me didn't actually own a memory card at the time, but I didn’t let that stop me; for the first few weeks (until I eventually caved and splashed out what must have been a lot of hard-earned pocket-money on an 8MB memory card from a now-defunct Blockbusters outlet) I aimed to complete the game in a single sitting. Given that the game was a 3-disc epic, looking back at that seems… overly ambitious, to say the least.

One evening, I don’t know why, I simply stopped playing. When I came back to it a few weeks later, I was utterly lost. This is the curse of the JRPG; you put it away for a while and when you return your bag is filled with a dozen swords with names like “Butterblade” and you’re lost in a bog with some guy called Reginald. 

Fast forward ten years (or thereabout), and college-student me decides it’s time to start from scratch. I rediscovered how much FFVII got right, and how much of that formula still persists in modern iterations, and it disabused me of the notion that it was just my own dewy-eyed nostalgia that made the game one of my favourites. The graphics may had aged between ’02 and ‘12, but the choice of themes and depth of characters remain easily up there with the best of the medium.

Ultimately, it’s the artistry behind the world I admire, and how the sometimes-simple, sometimes-crazy story fits perfectly into it. This game was made in an era when your surroundings were a painstakingly drawn “3D” background, and it excels at these; Midgar especially is a smoky cyberpunk dream world. The opening premise is a carefully-crafted parable of the tensions between environmentalism and consumerism which we can still see today; Uematsu’s legendary soundtrack is an undeniable gold-standard; and the characters, clichéd and blocky as they are, are still immediately endearing in their own ways.",1676041167,1676041167,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

How can you start playing FF VII without having sky-high expectations? It's widely believed to be the best FF game, one of the best RPGs of all time, the greatest game for the original Playstation, yada yada yada. But if you look past the nowadays dated but still charming 3D grafics, which were a first for the series in 1997, you'll quickly notice that it basically is just like every other FF game that came before: It is no doubt a great game, the story is epic and emotional, the atmosphere and artstyle are unique, the music is fantastic and in general it is just a very fun and motivating game to play (for the very most part). 
But: 
The combat system is basically still the exact same since the first game (a few notable tweaks aside) and it is still the same old Final Fantasy gameplay since 1987. In some areas FF VII was even a bit stripped back and streamlined compared to previous FF games: There is no more Job system, no more abundance of playable characters like in FF VI and you only have three active party members at once, instead of the usual four. For the very most part, FF VII is also considerably easier than its predecessors. The good thing is that there is very little to no necessary grinding whatsoever, so it flows a bit better, but it also feels a bit like on rails sometimes. All of this made me think that for me FF VII is the same case as FF VI: Yes, it's great, yes, it's epic, yes, it definitely stands out within the RPG genre, still i can't help but feel that it is slightly overrated.

The most things to complain about are really just nitpicking though: On the pre-rendered backgrounds it is sometimes very hard to see where you can actually go. The controls can get a bit fiddly, too, especially during heated battles, when you are under a lot of pressure. Finally, the german translation is full of spelling errors, missing letters (sometimes even whole words) and stuff like that, so it makes reading the dialogue a bit tedious at times.

All of this does little to take away from the overall greatness of the game. However, there is one major flaw, that keeps popping up again and again in almost every FF game i've played so far: The last third is a lot less enjoyable than the rest of the game, because it gets pretty cryptic and the difficulty spike in the final dungeon is just ridiculous. The game starts to give you only very minimal hints where to go next and either you are a very patient person who backtracks over the whole world map to check every possible location again until you find the right spot to progress, or you just have to take a look at a walkthrough. What is even more frustrating and irritating though, is the mentioned sudden increase in difficulty in the last dungeon. It is simply beyond me why every last dungeon in those older FF games just catches you completely off-guard, even though your characters are pretty strong without any problems or necessary grinding at all so far (my characters all were between lvl 60 and 70 when I reached the final boss). Battle strategies that worked flawlessly for the whole game are suddenly completely useless. To top it all off, as always the final dungeon is a quite long one (about one and a half to two hours at the very least) and the game gives you exactly ONE possibility to save your game and no shops or merchants where you could stock up on items and equipment. So, if you make the mistake to enter the final dungeon ill-equipped, with underdeveloped characters and insufficient gear, you'll probaly end up just completely f*cked-up and unable to beat a game that was ridiculously easy for 35 to 40 hours. Even though I basically knew what was coming (because I played FF III, IV plus The After Years, V and VI so far) and thought I'd be prepared, I still found the final boss fight pretty hard and unforgiving. If this would have been my first FF game, I'd have been pretty p*ssed about this unreasonable endgame difficulty. However, this flaw isn't a specific flaw of FF VII, it is the same sh*t in almost every previous FF game. The only FF game I've played so far that had a comparatively smooth endgame for me was FF V, because of the excellent Job System that provides you with a ton of flexibility, but is sadly absent since FF VI.

Overall, I can see why people were going nuts over this game 25 years ago: For 1997 standards, it is a game with pretty epic proportions and it is still as good in 2023. However, my personal favorite is still FF IV, even if it's just because FF VII still hadn't really changed things up that much since then.

The plot of the game can be a bit confusing at times but in my opinion still managed to impress me and keep me wanting more. What I look for in a story game is a story that makes me crave for answers and to see the end of things and ff7 did just that. I loved watching my team tackle the small problems that became world ending problems. Loved the story.

The art style of the game is probably my favorite part of the game. I had previously thought I would hate the old graphics and art and that they would be outdated but I was so off. I loved how many pretty environments and awesome towns and buildings there were. Those areas make up for the empty areas of the game that exist due to the limitations of the time. Loved the art

Lastly the characters of the game are so very likeable and well written. Notably, my favorites were Cid and the Turks. I like both of them for the same reason, and that being the humor made me laugh throughout the whole game. Cid was just always making snarky and witty remarks and the Turks were just always being stupidly goofy and I loved it. Each character's backstory gave me more of a reason to actually like them and understand their motives. I have only played ff7 and ffx but I can confidently say the ff7 crew is my favorite crew by a mile. Also worth mentioning that cloud and sephiroth are just the coolest protagainst and antagonist ever.

PROS:

++ Excellent Modding scene transforms the game into the remaster we have always wanted.
+ Fun materia system lets you customize how you play the game.
+ Unique setting mixes medieval fantasy with modern day
+ Amazing cast of characters, brilliant character design and well written. Also has an Intimidating Villain.
+ Probably the best videogame soundtrack ever, that is not an exaggeration.
+ The best Final Boss I have ever seen on a game (And I have played a lot of games)

CONS:

- Requires internet connection to start the game. BOOOO!
- Dated graphics, sometimes laughable chubby arms. (Fixed with Mods)
- Has that problem most FF games have where the story momentum halts, before the big finale as you run around doing other things.
- This game is responsible for becoming Square Enix's cash cow and thus we got a plethora of bad spin offs based on this game and Cloud Strife is literally everywhere.
- Hard to enjoy today without spoilers. Mostly everyone knows the iconic final boss theme and what happens to a certain character.

I enjoy the combat and materia system! Combos for EXTRA POWER! Materia leveling makes sometimes the tedious part of JRPGs SUPER SATISFYING!",1673706828,1673706828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FFVII was originally released in 1997, so it is definitely pretty outdated as far as graphics, sound quality, etc go. When you're outside of battle, the characters are blocky and their proportions make them look like Popeye. The soundtrack is catchy and iconic for a reason, but the instruments and sound fonts are definitely not what they are now. It was pretty ahead of its time when it was released, but now that we are 25+ years out, simply put... If you are the type of gamer that needs total immersion and amazing, state of the art graphics, you will definitely be put off by this game.

If that doesn't bother you, though, you are definitely in for a treat. This game has become a staple in gaming and JRPGs, and it got that status for a reason! Where this game really excels is its story and characters. Set in a futuristic, industrial world, an electric power company has gained too much power and authority, gaining an army for itself and taking over the large city of Midgar. Your party is a group of rebels seeking to take this company down, led by an ex-soldier from their military. As the game goes on, you learn more about the electric company's shady practices and experiments and just how much they're sucking the life force of the planet for their own greed, and all the (MANY MANY) repercussions of that. Also hey maybe greedy corporations having THEIR OWN PRIVATE MILITARY could be bad for everyone possibly???

As much as I love FFVII, it is not my favorite Final Fantasy. With that said, though, if you're new to the Final Fantasy series and not sure where to start, I would probably recommend this as your entry point to the series. The main Final Fantasy games are set in different worlds, with different settings and casts of characters, so there is no need to play them in order or dive in at any specific point. So many of FFVII's characters, themes, and concepts have become THE standard for JRPGs. FFVII has spawned sequels, prequels, remakes, movies, cameo appearances of its characters in other games... Even so many years after its initial release, this game has managed to stay relevant and keep people clamoring about it. I still see characters in newer games get compared to Cloud or Sephiroth pretty frequently.

In playing this game, you are allowing yourself to experience a vital piece of gaming history.",1673680931,1673680931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+The characters. Where do I start with the characters of Final Fantasy 7. Literally everyone in the world knows who Cloud is and for good reason. This game really goes out of its way to develop the main cast. All of them are lovable and it's honestly hard to hate on any of them. Aerith is such a great character honestly. 

+The story is some of the best narratives you will ever find. It is heavy yet unpredictable. Puts you into an existential crisis just the way I like it. The story had so many elements and yet they all mesh together well in a way that's not too hard to digest. Finding out about Cloud's past blew my mind away as a kid. Maybe it's a spoiler but who doesn't know about it at this point but the dam death of Aerith hit me hard as a kid and I am happy to say it still hits so dam hard now.

+This game isn't the longest but since I mentioned it already, Aerith's death happens at the end of disc 1. This game is a 3 disc game. You actually play most of the game without her but oh my god this game truly makes you care about the characters that even though we are without Aerith for longer than we are with her, she will still be missed throughout the whole story. Of course she is being mentioned constantly but dam.

+There is a fair amount of side content in this game if you want to go for all the collectibles like getting ultimate weapons and the like. Personally I just consume my Final Fantasy games for the story so I don't indulge in side content so much but if you really love the game then this game does have it for you.

+The soundtrack is timeless. You cannot find anyone who will dislike the soundtrack of this game. Hard to sum it up into words but I will just say Aerith's theme is very very emotional and hits all the heart strings, Tifa's theme is a solid ass track and of course the iconic one-winged angel. Catch me shivering in my boots throughout my many years to that piece, what a dam masterpiece of an OST.

+The world is beautiful and the places didn't feel like they were just put for the sake of content. It feels really rewarding to explore the world and talking to the npcs wasn't such a chore. I really loved Midgar. Sadly we only really explore it for like 10 hours or so but dam what a great place. The different areas were all so unique and great places too. Nibelheim is such an iconic place and dam can't believe they brought the smash bros stage to this game too in Northern Cave.

+I mentioned characters already but I have to specifically mention Sephiroth since he is so sick and one of the greatest antagonists in jrpgs. It's hard to talk about him without spoiling the story but I'll just leave it as he was truly satisfying to see in the story. In fact it is very rare to find a person who doesn't know who Sephiroth is in this day and age as he is that iconic. Maybe overrated to a degree but dam he is so dam cool. His story and his fight are very memorable to me.

+The combat is very fun with the atb gauge. It wasn't just who is faster gets to make their turn first as people will get their turn if you take too long similar to games like Child of Light. It is still turn-based but you have to be more active with your play. There is a fair amount of thinking that gets involved in here and there weren't too many bs things with the combat. Except turning into frogs... Who even thought this was a good idea... The worst thing that can possibly happen to you is getting froglocked and you didn't save recently so you will have to sit through it and hope for the best.

+Along with the combat being fun, you can pick and build anyone you so choose since there is no obvious power creep between characters. Of course there is some character-specific cheese like with Tifa and Cait Sith, but this game is perfectly fun playing whoever you like. Of course I don't even need to say I used Yuffie and Tifa for the most part. You do need to invest in 6 characters if you don't want to get messed up by the end of the game.

+Even though there are many things you can grind in this game (which personally i enjoy doing), you definitely don't need to grind to complete this game, just expect a much more difficult game if you don't grind. You will definitely have a much easier time if you go for stuff like ultimate weapons for each of the characters. I didn't bother going for those in this playthrough but it is definitely doable.

-The visuals are definitely outdated.

-The random encounters are so frustrating to deal with in this game since running takes so long. On top of this battles take so so so long which doesn't matter with bosses and the like but for random encounters it does get frustrating, especially since fleeing takes a while.

-This game definitely needs a turbo button. Exploration takes way too long. On this note everyone should try playing this with the 7th heaven mod.

-All the minigames suck. Honestly, I didn't enjoy any of them.

Overall the story and characters truly make FF7 the beloved game that it is. Hard to recommend to people who are new to JRPGs because it has so many inconveniences which are not found in modern games, but for anyone with the patience for these old games, you should definitely try it.",1638931051,1673661319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why?
- Pacing - it's too fast, too many things happen at once where the next problem starts:
- Writing (background) - there is not enough of it, context is missing and I, as a player don't know why I should care most of the time of who is who and
- Writing (quality) who they are and why they want this. Of course, some of the information will be available later but because so much happens so fast you don't give the player enough reasons to care about it all. It needs more time. The quality of the text is just abysmal. Some texts are clearly written for 12-15 year old boys in mind, which explains why some of this even spilled over into VIIR, mostly how every female character behaves towards Cloud. It's just way, way, worse here.
- Background design - it's an old game, so you have to expect old graphics, but in a lot of scenes I had no idea where I can go. It's not clear. Also where VIII and IX are mostly similar in background quality VII is worse than those two, so expect that.
- Funny enough, VIIR improved the battle system by a lot by copying some things from IX in context to materia and weapons

And now how this was ported:
- Controls are terrible. The game doesn't show you the actual buttons when giving instructions but the placeholder name for the function, there is also no support for XBox controllers, some buttons work, most don't. It works well enough, but I expected more. The d-pad for example doesn't work at all which forces you to use the sticks to navigate, which, for menues is terrible
- If you intend to use the booster - you need to activate the cloud saving for that, for whatever reason
- I expected to get at least some QoL improvements, but they just seemed to port it as cheaply as they can. It works in full HD though, just upscaled with bars on the side, fine enough by me.

My main reason to suggest to play VIIR instead are still the pacing and writing though. VIIR does a better job in portraying the characters and their relationships to each other and there have been some significant changes to the writing quality, the amount of writing, the amount of stuff happening and some plot elements that make it better for a modern audience without nostalgia googles on.
It's true though that you will understand some hints to the original plot only when playing the original. But in my experience, VIIR is a superior experience overal and playing the original is not worth it. I will continue out of curiousity though, but I rather experience all the plots and characters in the Remake first.",1673081425,1673084969,False,1,2,0.355773746967315674,0,True,False,False

I genuinely recommend this game. It has all sorts of things from Dragons to Aliens to Massive Bio-mechanical Kaiju this game has it all.

Your main team consists of a Talking Dog, a Florist,Amputated Coal Miner, Bartender,Gambling Robot Cat, and an Angry Swearing Pilot all led by an amnesiac with an incredibly large amount of trauma in his quest to kill a silver haired mama's boy who intends to become one with the planet. With the optional additions of a 16 year old Kleptomaniac, and a Narcoleptic who may or may not be a vampire.

This game is incredibly weird and wacky but can also switch to incredibly deep and emotional moments despite its general cast of weirdos and misfits.

Along with heavy themes of environmentalism , corruption and unethical human treatment. this is one hell of a game as in less than an hour of game play you go from committing major acts of terrorism to cross dressing in order to sneak into a kingpins mansion so you can rescue your childhood friend (and maybe crush its up to you to decide) 

I'm just making up a lot of this on the spot so you should probably listen to another review to actually get a comprehensive review on what this game is.

All you should know is this is probably one of if not my favorite game ever. I love the combat , The power progression (equipment, level-ups and materia), the character interactions and their personalities not to mention the 10/10 soundtrack of this game. 

It may be very graphically outdated and has some weird mistranslations and a lot of incredibly cheesy dialogue,but if you look past that you can probably enjoy this game like I do",1668090552,1672324281,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Words themselves are hardly enough to share my love for FF7, and somehow, it wasn't exactly love at first sight. This is not going to be another basic review to tell you how great this game is. To truly capture my relationship with it, I gotta share a bit of my story towards it.

I started my steam account on June 2013, I had always been a console player. But in 2012, an important member of my family died of cancer, for about a year, it was merely impossible to get satisfaction and distraction out of my usual hobbies, video games included. I tried my best to dive back into games that I loved, with very engaging and moving scenarios.. No luck there. On June, a friend of mine, told me that I should install steam and play with him, mostly prop hunt and CS Source. So I did, and I opened myself to PC gaming. Then a month later, Final Fantasy VII released. I was already familiar with the characters of the universe, don't ask me why but I had watched Advent Children a couple times before. So I tried, told myself, ""hell, everyone's pissing on my FFIX opinion by saying VII is better, let's find out"".

I think that, nothing could have prepared me for such an adventure...

You all know the basics, you play Cloud, a former SOLDIER from the Shinra Electric Company turned mercenary. He's running around the world with his buddies from the AVALANCHE eco terrorist group, fighting against Shinra. Why you may ask ? Because Shinra is siphoning the planet's life blood, redeemed as Mako energy, pumped out by Reactors. And cut, that's basically all you need to know. Of course given the immense pop culture reach of this game, you probably know a lot more than you think.

And this is where the fun begins. Seeing Cloud and his little party of misfits run around made me reflect on adulthood with more strenght than any other game. Final Fantasy related, I strongly believe this FF has the widest variety of themes ever explored. From Grief to loss, through hate to survivor's guilt. From asking yourself why you are the way you are to who you are. The mature themes developped will leave a stain of philosophical reflection you'll have a hard time washing off.

Gameplay wise, this FF uses a ""materia system"" that pushes the possibility to a new horizon compared to previous titles. Materias have specific uses, like magic action or support spells, but they offer a wide selections of posibilities you'll probably need help figuring out, giving this title, a true and unique energy that is kind of unmatched when you look at the series. Materia's aside, it's basic ATB turn based gameplay, works like a charm, nothing to see.

The PC port is rather good, community is insanely good: Mods, help guides, someone will answer you, if you ask nicely. A small downside, I am French (that's not the downside) and the translation is a mess, I don't know if it's the case everywhere. You should opt for an English language playthrough, if you can. Wide support is present, although it doesn't respect the screen ratio, you'll have to tweak around to set it up, however I had no issues whatsoever with controller support, but I saw people making a big deal out it, so I guess it depends on the controller.

In the end, this game helped getting me out of my depression, like I said I couldn't play anything more than 20min before feeling bored and unattracted. Without realizing it, I put 15 hours in FFVII the day I started it. The plot, its loving and interesting characters, everything is perfectly fitted to make a masterpiece. And here I am, 9 years later, writing about it.
While FFIX was there during my entire childhood, to shape my identity and the very basis of who I am, FFVII pushed me further in life, pushed me harder, deeper into adulthood, in order to understand what life is all about.

Final Fantasy 7 is one of the most influential games in history and most people know that.. but I think the game's legacy doesn't end there, FF7 didn't only change the dimensions of the series but it transformed the whole series into a mainstream one, that every gamer should know about.
Don't let me start on the story.. It's one that has many twists yet each one of them is very fitting and don't feel forced at all, great characters with amazing writing and well-structured motives, captivating world-building that is on par with the greatest novels ever written, and ultimately a truly shocking ending that had people tear down all over the world.

For example, Aerith's theme song, the producer of FF7 in Hironobu Sakaguchi made this game as a memory to his recently deceased mother. That's why the theme of memory is so prevalent in this game. The memory of Zach. The memory of Cloud. Sephiroth's past. Aerith and her mother's memory. The memory of the planet itself. Red 13, Yuffie, Barret, Cid, Tifa, Vincent and others deal with their own pasts as well. And this theme captures all the emotions of motherhood of characters like Aerith. Caring, loving but also sentimental, nostalgic and sad, especially when they pass on and leave their children.You can tell the musical direction is a unique mix of optimism and somberness to reflect the producer's feelings as he was crafting this game.

There is more depth to this game than you'd think. And there's so much content, replaying the game might change your entire story since there's just so much you could miss potentially.

The pace in the Remake version of FFVII is far too slow for my liking, but then to each their own.

During the beginning part of the game, I noticed the glitch where the floor texture disappears and appears from time to time as I move around before I meet Beret and their characters for the first time. I do wish I could have kept the original Final Fantasy VII for the PC during the late 1990s, but I don't have it even today.

Some would say this game is simple, and yes you can beat the final boss in 40-60 hours of gameplay, but this game is so much more than it seems. The story arc is so beautifully designed that it covers every type of gamer, as you can select some key paths to take or not, and therefore tailor your own experience. This also allows the game to be very re-playable.

From my own experience, I feel you would need around 100-120 hours to complete the game in a ""100% fashion"", meaning you unlock and defeat all the extra bosses and see all the extra stories and animations. And that is if you know exactly what you are doing, or follow a walkthrough. I simply cannot imagine how many hours would it take for someone who never played this game to finish it completely in their first run. And this is what I adore about FFVII, it is simply as complex as you want it to be and become.

Understanding it dates from 1997., one might say that graphics suck or that it is not playable to this date, and first go for the remake or simply grab another game, but the fact that this game is so advanced in it's story and approach just crushes everything else, including other games. [spoiler] I mean, you can make the protagonist date different characters at a certain point of game, which is an outcome of around 8 different dialog decisions you make across the previous chapters, which can lead even to a homosexual date. This is just one little ""spoiler"" which represents how advanced this game actually is, and the rest is for you to discover. [/spoiler]

The game's main quest is interesting and fun, while it provides a mountain of extra value like side quests, hidden characters, weapons and so much more. It also has additional in-game mini-games which just add more fun to it all, while Chocobo breeding deserves a book or a game for itself how well it is designed.

For a beginner, this might be a challenging game to conquer, as some bosses require either serious skill in the Materia combination or the story reading part, as there are some hints and tricks hidden in the story itself. This mechanic leads to diving deeper in the story, trying to understand it even better. For someone who played this before, but hasn't played it for years, I highly recommend re-playing the game, as there is so much extra value to it coming from new perspective of the player, as we grow older and older.

Characters are very detailed in their design and their stories are remarkable as well, but what makes this game completely unforgettable is it's soundtrack, the music. The music is so carefully well crafted that it emotionally adds on to the entire story all the time. It adds that kick to it. Simple, maybe, but very catchy tunes that you will either whistle, dream, or use as a ringtone on your cellphones.

All in all, and to this very date, this is the best game I have ever played!

So, if you love great stories and RPGs, it is always a good time to (re)try Final Fantasy VII!

Remember that cave in Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow that is full of Zubats and you can't walk without using Repel? Now imagine a game that takes place entirely inside that cave with no Repel whatsoever. 50 hours of dull combats, in which you just mash the ""OK button"" because the enemies are too weak or dumb to require any attention. Hundreds, if not thousands, of combats like these.

Another problem with combat is the absurd lenght of unskipabble animations during some actions. Many times I just chose not to use my best summoning moves because of how long the animation would take and how boring it is to wait it out. The worst offender is the ridiculous move the final boss has in which he [spoiler]destroys the whole solar system[/spoiler] and the animation seems to never end. And he uses it multiple times. Unbelievable.

And that's the core of Final Fantasy 7.

I say combat is the core of the game because the story is a huge let down. A major disapointment. It's so ridiculously convoluted that instead of being compelling, it's just confusing. So, since you don't know wtf is going on, you just keep on fighting, hoping things will eventually start to make more sense. But they never do.

And there's the big spoiler, the one everyone knows about. The ""most heart-wrenching moment in the history of video games"". It was definetely not. There was no decent character development up until that point; [spoiler]the death itself was weird and confusing since it's not even clear if Sephiroth exists, if he's only inside Cloud's head, if it was a clone of his;[/spoiler] I didn't know then and I still don't know even after finishing the game.

So, combat is dull (except for some bosses), the story is crap, the map is useless, the game's overworld feels like a big empty desert, the sections added for variety are absolute garbage, specially the snowboarding one (the chocobo race is probably the least terrible of them all) and the list goes on. Playing this game quickly became a chore, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. So I finished it and I don't intend on playing one more second of it ever again.

I guess back in the day people were bedazzled by the sight of 3D boobs or by the sheer size of a game divided in 3 discs (the third part is a lot shorter than the first two, and I was really glad with that). The game is big, indeed, but it's full of nothingness for the most part. The other part is a weird and nonsensical story.

Final Fantasy 7 is not worthy of tying Chrono Trigger's shoelaces.",1588892221,1667764350,False,3,3,0.415394365787506104,1,True,False,False

[b]Mods I would recommend:[/b]
- The Reunion (""Beacause"" new Translation, Model Overhaul, 60 FPS Battles, HD Menus, Audio Overhaul)
- SYW Textures

I played through the entire game with these mods running on my Steam Deck. Once I got everything running, it was a seamless experience that holds up very well technically.

[h1]Subjective Thoughts:[/h1]
As someone who has never played the original and has no nostalgia for it, I wanted to play it for historical purposes. I knew the game was wildly influential and held a big spot in a lot of peoples hearts. I always hear mentions of its mechanics, characters, and story.

I can absolutely see why everyone likes it so much. The cast of characters is charming, the story is interesting, and the battles are nice. Any qualms I have with the game I think have been addressed in the past 25 years of game development, so I won't bother.

[b] With a little time spent getting some mods running, its a game I definitely recommend for those like me who have no nostalgia whatsoever. Get a history lesson. [/b]",1666636435,1666636435,True,42,0,0.826416015625,0,True,False,False

I'm really glad that they took that particular direction with Clouds backstory too. Its really good to play the original before playing the remake. The remake is about 6-8 hours of the original so you're able to get a much better idea of the story. I'm excited to play the remake with the knowledge of the events in the original. I LOVED the score, and I'm so excited to hear more the adaptions in the remake, as well as the songs that are further in the story line. I totally recommend this game. I think many have a misconception that turn based games are boring. From someone who used to believe that, I can say its very wrong. I've played ff9 and 7 now, excitingly waiting to find the time to play the others, and I can say in all confidence turn based games are entertaining and fun to play when done right, so don't let that stop you from playing this game (same idea with graphics too. If you have trouble playing older ff games though, there are many mods you can use for both 7 and 9 and so on.

This is not per se a review, more so my experience and anecdotes, mixed in with a few pros and cons (for me personally).

Where to begin? I am playing Games since the early 90s. I owned a Nintendo 64 before I got my Playstation (had to sell my N64 and my Games so I could get the PS1, still don't know why I did that, stupid kid me...) and my first Contact with FF VII was on the Demo Disc that was included in the PS1.
I started it up, played a little, didn't like it and stopped playing. That was it. Those are my FF VII memories.

But I got older, I am nearing my 40's now and I do like to play a lot (!) of Games, including many old school Games that I either want to replay because of fond memories or Games that I never played before because I didn't have them or didn't give them a chance when I was younger.

So, with FF VII it was hard for me. Everyone is praising this Game as one of the best Games ever made, for some it even is THE best Game ever made. I could never connect (also probably because I don't like Turn Based RPG's at all - although I played some very late and appreciated them at least a little).

With that all being said, how did I like FF VII? Is it the best Game ever? For me, no! 
Is it one of the greatest Games ever? For me, tending more to no, BUT I actually found an appreciation for this kind of Game and for FF VII especially.
This Game came out in 1997 and for that time - if you were into Turn Based Combat - I get why many people praise this to high heavens.

One of my thoughts was that this Game didn't age very well, but after a while of playing I found it kind of charming. The World, the Characters, even the Combat and Exploration, everything grew on me.
Did I really love it? No, I liked it, it is (for me) a good Game.

I have to mention that I HATED the missing Controller Options for my X-Box One Controller, wish there was an Update. I could play with my Controller but it was showing on Screen only the Keyboard Prompts. Not even the Keys themselves but the description of what the Key is doing.
I know there are probably some mods or 3rd party Options out there that can remedy some of that, but I played it as it is.

So, I sunk almost 50 hours into the Game, finished it, did some side stuff (Golden Chocobo, got my Knights of the Roundtable thingy, etc.) and missed out on a few things. I didn't fight all the Weapons, don't know how to find them and I didn't really want to look it up. Also I didn't get all the Limit Breaks for all the Characters and stuff like farming for lvl99 or 99Million Gil...no thanks.

So, I would still recommend this Game because at the End of the day I had fun and I was invested.
Not only can I know appreciate the Game, I alson want to play more FF Games and maybe give some other Turn Based Games a shot (I know, in FF VII it is only kind of Turn Based with the Battle System thing).
Looking forward now to playing the Final Fantasy VII Remaster and FF 15. 
Those will be next and some time in the future I will stock my collection up with all the older FF Games.

So yeah, very long story short: Good Game. Check it out. But let's be real, everyone here probably already played this a million times...",1664670413,1664670413,True,3,0,0.56204378604888916,5,True,False,False

Cloud-saving is kind of nice I suppose, since the game is so long (It can also be disabled.) Mistranslations and errors have been fixed. The game itself flows smoothly and is not prone to eye-sore jittering. I have not run into any crashing. FF7 itself is a great part of RPG history and worth a try.

[b]⊖[/b] Logging in with Square is irritating and leads to issues if you aren't connected via internet. I'm not sure that level of invasiveness in the DRM is worth what benefits it gives you. The monster designs in this one are absolutely laughable, to the point of embarrassment. That's part of the fun for some, though.

[b]✎[/b] Solid port that has fixed issues both in the original PC and PSX versions.

It's a great game that holds up well and has a lot of emotional value to many of us from the first generation of kids who grew up with video games as far back as we can remember.

The gameplay is solid and a good twist on the FF formula, which any good FF should be. It has plenty of little (and huge) secrets that will keep you digging into all the nooks of the game. The story has all the awkward points you'd expect from an ambitious 90s game, and it's interesting to view it against the smoother retelling in FF7 Remake. And with the added bombshell of smuggling all your mastered materia to a fresh saved game, this is well worth $12.

Review of game itself
Battle system is extremely simple.
Long (very long like more than 30 minutes) stretches between allowable save points often immediately after a boss battle meaning you have to wait to save after a boss battle..
Character control or navigation is often clumsy. Arrow keys are tilted 45 degrees which is sometimes confusing. Objects blocking path may require trial and error to get by them. It is even worse when the picture displayed shows the characters far away or partially obscured.
Character trait development depends a lot on Materia. Materia advancement is very slow.

It isn't the most intuitive to set up and configure everything with a modern controller, the translation while not ""bad"" has some moments of awkward and campy dialogue and the visuals, especially the 3D models, haven't aged all that great though you could argue these points do add to the charm of FFVII. 

That being said there are many aspects of FFVII that have aged very gracefully, or are just flat out timeless. The story is very engaging throughout it's 40-50 hour runtime, a few very interesting characters and quite a few good plot twists, not to mention this game is pretty hecking funny at times, intentionally or not.

The combat system is pretty good all things considered with some very interesting additions in the Limit Breaks and the Materia system. Pulling out the occasional super move makes for a very nice incentive to having your party being beaten down by the enemy and the Materia system allows you to customise the abilities of every single party member to the way you like it. Unfortunately that also means that aside from limit breaks there isn't much that makes a party member unique from another.

One thing that hasn't aged all is the soundtrack. So many good tone setters and just generally good jams, honestly the game might be worth playing for the soundtrack alone, it's just that good.

While its not my favorite RPG ever made, I absolutely respect Final Fantasy VII and it definitely deserves its title as one of the most important RPGs of all time.",1661453564,1661453564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Final Fantasy VII was when Final Fantasy TRULY became a mainstream franchise. The first time it became 3D with amazing graphics and visuals for its time... it was also the one I was most looking forward to as it is the ff game that generally EVERYONE points to as ""the best final fantasy game"". While I came into the game with HIGH hopes, just finishing final fantasy VI and LOVING it, I left with a bit of a mixed feeling for ff7.

Story
Final Fantasy VII's story had one of the biggest advantages out of any of the previous final fantasy games, the usage of not only 3d visuals, but cutscenes, multiple dialogue boxes, camera angles like never before, amazing presentation to allow them to fully flesh out what story they want to tell instead of the limitations like before. The story is more straight forward compared to previous entries like 6, which is how humanity is killing the planet in order to fulfill their selfish goals even if it costs the very planet they live on. While people make ff7 a revered story... I think it is fine imo. While it isn't the GREATEST story, it does have some pretty good highs especially when pulling off their twists around the mid point of the game. While I do like the story, it also comes with its fair share of stand out flaws. For example, I don't think midgar was well paced the very moment we entered the shinra tower. Yeah it is the haha funny stair scene that annoyed me, but also the fact that in between every single story bit, you are forced to play through a pointless minigame that are not only not very good, but ruin the game's pacing it had previously. The stories' pacing overall is what really ruined it the most in terms of what I think of it, also with the fact that it has way more outdated story bits like calling barret the R word and women slapping minigame, but also the fact that it wasn't as interesting to me not only cause of its lack of depth compared to ff6, but for also another issue I had with the game.

Character
Final Fantasy VII's characters were simply... very bad. Look, Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa were really good characters, and while I do think Cloud was especially the best fleshed out character, it took him quite a long time to reach that point as before he is just kinda bland till the twist around the mid way point. Still, those early segments with him being a very unreliable narrator, being confused was still very interesting, just took a bit to get there. Aerith, especially her relationship with other characters made her to be a VERY interesting character and had pretty good development imo. Tifa also was a pretty good character, with her only flaw being responsible for one of the worst decisions in the story that can be stretched to make sense, but thinking about it was kinda just dumb. However after that, is when FF7's REAL problem kick in, the rest of the cast you follow with for the majority of the game just aren't that good. Barret seems like someone who would be very interesting, which is cause he is... for 1/5th of the game, till you reach a certain town in which his character development kinda finishes and he becomes a much blander character the rest way through the game. The rest of the cast just simply suck. Cid is an asshole who is annoying at times, Yuffie was just boring and had very little to do apart from lmao steal your materia, Red XIII almost NEVER grows even during his pivotal part in the story, stayed the same beginning to end. Cait Sith idk why he even stayed in the party and is just a terrible member, as he is FORCED into your party, BETRAYS you very early on, and the party is just like ""ok we forgive you!""... why. Vincent is also just a very boring, bland character who's only development is his backstory of him being cheated on. Overall the characters being weak def made the story weaker as well, even tho it was a pretty ok story to begin with. Look I know that there HAD to be weak characters, even ff6 had some weak side characters, but the difference is that ff7 has a TON of the character being weak. While they have their moments, overall I do think they are overhyped simply do to them having more development in the side games, which is great, but in the original they aren't that good. Even more disappointing was Sephiroth, who for being the FAN FAVORITE of the community, was overall not that interesting of a character. His motivation was overall bleh, he was at times comedic when it was obvious the game wanted me to take him serious, but he was just eh in terms of character.

Gameplay
Final Fantasy VII, from previous entries, has MUCH MUCH better presentation not only in story telling, but in gameplay as well. Animations went from being cool, to being SPECTACLES. The Materia system as well is just fantastic, in which is feels like the ff6 esper system but much more fleshed out, and while it does remove characters being unique as EVERY ability is linked to materia, discovering which to pair and the feeling that you are breaking the game was fantastic. However, it does have its fair share of issues. While I did mention that the animations are spectacle, it is also one of its bigger issue for the game, the animations are long... a bit TOO long. Battles and random encounters in general take MUCH longer compared to previous entries simply due to the amount of animations, opening camera pan, enemies now having attack and hurt animations, cast time, SUMMONS. While it does look AMAZING, it can get annoying, as there is no way of skipping the animations, and some of them like the knights of the round summon can take a FULL MINUTE which can be really cool at first, but can stretch battles sooo much more cause of it. It is still very cool, but def too long combat wise. Minigames also suck, I did kinda enjoy chocobo racing and maybe snowboarding, but the rest were just bad, and worse of all, forced. While it may seem like I dislike the combat, it is the complete opposite, I LOVED the gameplay as it was my favorite part of the game. While it has huge issues like too long due to animations, it is still the atb system that I love, just much prettier to look at even if grinding feels like an eternity.

Music
The music in this game was as expected, amazing. Cosmo Canyon, Jenova, one winged angel, bombing run, Aerith theme, there was sooo many songs that were just amazing. While it isn't my FAVORITE of the series, I still loved the ost. It can also hit hard especially during one scene, but overall is still really damn good.

Nitpicks/ Last Positive
- The game's difficulty was a bit on the easier side, final boss was a bit disappointing in terms of difficulty, but the endgame was easily my favorite part of the whole game, and while the superbosses just became watching knights of the round for 15 minutes, I still enjoyed the journey to prepping for them.
- Menu searching still annoying, there was an annoying issue where if I moved up or down in the menu and immediately clicked ok, it would skip a tab and choose something else which was really annoying.
- PC port isn't the best, no quicksave (but game isn't that hard so not that bad), no fast forward (made animations feel especially long my god), has bugs, and is overall not the cleanest, but is still good enough to play ff7
- ok I play all my jrpg on keyboard, and while key binding wasn't a big issue, the game did a TERRIBLE job telling me which key to press, and would just show [OK], instead of pushing my keybind which made it really confusing for when it instructs me what to do for a dumb minigame.

Conclusion
Final Fantasy VII was the one I was pretty hyped for, and while I do feel like the game is pretty overhyped, especially when people say its the best ff game, I still enjoyed the game. I liked the game's highs, but the game's low were just too much for  me sadly. I appreciate the game for what it did to the franchise, as it is EASILY the most important one, I don't think its close to the best final fantasy game imo.

-Graphics are dated (although this is to be expected from a game released a quarter century ago)

Finishing the game, I have to say that I think I would have enjoyed this game the most when I was at a certain age for it to have effected me in the same way many people say they've been effected by it. I mean this either in the sense of ""you had to be there when it came out in 1997"", or ""you needed to be in a certain mindset to sorta plow through the game and get the most out of it"".

First, I want to say that graphically, no matter what mods or upressing or blah blah you do, ultimately, this game was made for a CRT and that's where it looks best. I hooked my PC to an HDMI-to-Composite to my CRT TV, and while I'm sure a lot of quality was lost, It looked 1000x better than it looked on my monitor. If you have the means and ability to play it on a CRT, whether you're on PC or not, do it, you'll thank me later.

Secondly, the original English translation is absolute dogshit. I played through the game with The Reunion mod  which has the Beacause retranslation project, while following along reading the original script and any optional dialogue you necessarily have to miss by using this FF7 Script compilation by letao (https://letao.is-a-geek.net/ff7script/ ) I think this is [b]essential[/b] to play in the modern day. There are many moments in the story that, when I read the original script, are absolutely butchered and lose all of its original meaning and emotion.
The Reunion also features many other improvements, many of which are optional. This includes bug fixes (which fixes duping, sorry), restoring Playstation button prompts, raising the PC-exlusive 15 fps cap in battles to 60 fps, animation interpolation (off by default), switching out all of the low-poly overworld models with something closer to the in-battle models or otherwise based off concept art - if you aren't dead set on the original look or don't like the low-poly models like I didn't, then I'd go for it. (link; https://ff7.live/ )

Alright, on to the game itself. (A fair amount of this I'm taking from what I said to a friend, so it's a little loose);
The story is amazing, but besides a few outstanding moments often it's only in retrospect. I commend the game for having many different themes at play, some that would seem to have nothing in common, and managing to working them together in a way that no only avoids feeling muddled but actually compliment each other. Again, I feel like I
The dialogue itself is stilted and strangely unfulfilling in its goals, often vague or lacking distinct purpose - how do I put it... it feels, fluffy, airy? It has the same feel as a saturday morning cartoon right after you woke up and are half-asleep still as a kid - light, airy, as the words sort of come out and things happen like they should, things are happening but it's sort of stagnant, with no movement, floaty. It feels like nothing is happening while things are happening. I think this is common in a lot of TV shows. 
The pacing is pretty garbage, it's just all over the place whenever it wants to be. There'll be stretches of nothing, or long gaps of gameplay with little story, sometimes they're story all back to back to back and not in a plot point climax kind of way. It's so bizarre, the pacing is both ""things just sort of happen"" while also being feeling like there's momentum and that there's a force driving it. It can feel so directionless at times, you can leave some big event and for it to kinda tell you where to go but still feel like lost and be like ""ok... uh, what now?"". Some shit like the key is just absolutely archaic without a guide (if you played you know).
WITH THAT SAID, of course I think the story is excellent. 

All I need to say about the gameplay is:
Materia is a cool magic/ability system, though it's a little claustrophobic. Very good.
[i]FUCK ATB, IN EVERY FF GAME THAT USES ATB IT GETS FUCKING WORSE.[/i] I like turns better. I hate having to purposefully go in a menu to wait just so a group of enemies can't get 20 attacks in before I [i]eventually[/i] get my move out. It's worse here than in FF6, but it's nowhere as bad as it is in FFX-2. 
You can only have a party of 3 of your 6-8 party members, and while your benched members get half the xp (thank god) they get half the xp (oh shit these folks are 10 levels behind). Also, the way stats climb is very fucky and for some reason proportional to both the character's growth chart [i]and[/i] proportional to the current stats, making stat effecting accessories make a character level different? I don't know the technical details all I know is something fucky is happening there.

Again, I think that if I played FF7 at a particular point in my life it would have affected me deeply, and all of the stuff I missed and the secrets would have been fun things to get playing a second time through or whatever. Fun things that add to the depth of a game I already love as opposed to annoyances that make me play the game in a very specific way so I'm sure I'm not missing anything since I'm likely only going to be playing through the game once. All of the optional, mutually exclusive, missable, cryptic stuff which would have been amazing as a kid or as a long time fan just comes off as frustrating and tedious now. Its age and its transitionary-era general jank contribute to that feeling.

Conclusion... uh, play the game with The Reunion and with the script if you're like me at all, on a CRT if you have access to one.

I completely understand why everybody was excited for a remake... and they made a brand new FF7R that has its own continuity and shit going on, okay? Honestly there was nothing wrong with the contuity or story in of itself, it just needed some work on the pacing and, idk, a FFX-esque 3D world but still fundamentally the same FF7.
Not to shit on FF7R, I've yet to play it, it seems cool, but yeah, really bizarre world we live in.",1659081640,1659082192,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

IMO this version is superior to the ""remake"". I know it's nostalgia goggles and I really DGAF if anyone disagrees. This game was a milestone and if you were not there to see how it changed the game, it's difficult to describe. 

The story is a bastardized version of the original ideas that dev Takahashi (XENOGEARS BABY) came up with. Square deemed it too dark. They did hold on to a good deal of the original darker ideas and incorporate them into the story. There is a heavy influence on gnostic beliefs in this game and in Xenogears/Sagas. These beliefs are woven throughout the game.

The story is tl;dr the Bible. Jenova is the great calamity that fell from the sky (Lucifer) and Cloud/Christ (sacrifices himself to save the others) saves us. That is being too simplistic. I like how the devs wove Western mythos into the story. It's amazing how JRPG devs seem to be able to grasp these concepts and present them in an engaging manner without being disrespectful to the source. Holy crap, digress much? This is relevant though. I love this game because of the mythos woven through it. It's a story of self doubt. Overcoming it and triumphing. I think I can say that without spoiling it. I can't believe there are people who have not played this yet. Play it, play it now.

Definitely play this before you play that abomination remake. Yes it's pretty. Yes it's fun in a way but if you really want to experience the game without all that needless crap they've done to it; play this one. I'm just saying if you are a fan of JRPGs, especially this era, play it now! Did I say that enough yet? Play now!",1657832035,1657832035,True,9,1,0.564936816692352295,1,True,False,False

I’m also writing this review rather very late since I last played the game, but I will write one regardless. I suppose I can start with the fact that FF7 was introduced to me by someone who means a great deal to me and I’m so happy he did. I found out surprisingly FF4 was my first ever FF game. I wish so badly that my parents let me play on consoles or have consoles back then as a kid cause if I was allowed, I would’ve played this game on release. I’m sad I missed such an amazing game. But regardless I have finally played the original. The story is just something else, it makes you feel. I’ve only ever had one game really truly make me feel and this game being the other. I don’t want to give out much, but just this can make you feel emotions. The characters also get quite a lot of dept, which is one of my favorite things about the game. And of course with a game with such amazing story it comes with amazing music that really sets the tones for scenes and battles. The music is honestly, in my opinion, the best music ever for a video game. I actually still listen to the music from the game for some past time. And lastly, the Materia and battle mechanics are unique and without getting too much into it you can literally decide to do some interesting things gameplay wise with it. You can also do some dumb funny things with the Materia. You have a ton of different Materia and can choose to just try soooo many things. The summons is also amazing and my favorite. The graphics for its time I think are amazing. It’s definitely playable still and I had zero issues with it. 
I recommend this game highly as it has become my all-time favorite game. I plan to 100% the game in time. I’ve also watched the gameplay for remake and now that remake was shadow dropped, I can finally personally play that. Patience is a virtue. 100/10 franchise.

I'm sorry, I know it's a classic. I'm just not into it. I played for a few hours and the story is absolutely linear. It's basically hitting next, next, next, whether I'm going through dialogue or combat. There are a few sections that play more like an adventure game, but a mostly boring one.

There are no choices that matter. It's almost a visual novel with combat, and the combat isn't very good. The original Pokemon games are JRPGs from this same time and they're FAR more interesting - they may also be linear, but team composition and training offer interesting tactical choices. FWIW, what I got to see of the story isn't very good either. There's a cross dressing sequence early on that's just made of cringe, with plenty of jokes trivializing sexual assault. The original Fallout is from the same year as this game, and while it's terribly juvenile in its own way, it's FAR less painful to play than this. 

I dunno, maybe it gets better 10 hours in. But I'm not going to keep playing a game I don't enjoy in order to find out.

While I'm at this... the interface SUCKS. The keyboard controls are awful, the game is meant to be played with a controller even if the kind of controls it uses would be better suited for a mouse. I understand that it's originally a console title, but this isn't an emulated game, it's a port. And I want to use a mouse to click around. It would be a FAR better game that way. Why can't I just click on dialog options or on menu items?

It's a fine example of a classic jrpg from that weird border period when the genre was still niche but becoming more popular. Before the Final Fantasy name was the blockbuster it is now. For many, it was their first and so nostalgia will do a lot of the heavy lifting for you in terms of whether or not you like it.

If you didn't play the game before when it was new or your only experience is with newer jrpgs and you're wondering if this one is worth, well it has a lot of crusty old mechanics like save points and random encounters, but the fights are quick and save points plentiful. It still tells a solid story that is different in many ways from what we've seen so far of the Remake, for good or ill. The graphics haven't aged well (tho I'd argue the blocky character models are part of the game's charm and identity) but the game has been modded inside out to make it age more gracefully if that's more your speed.

It's personally not my favorite in the series: I think it kneecaps its own tension by making you participate in too many minigames to advance the plot. Midgar is engrossing and feels vibrant as a location, but most of the rest of the world is sort of bland and seems to lack a kind of singular overall creative direction to make it feel more alive and coherent. Combat is mechanically interesting and the materia system offers a lot of depth but most of the game just isn't difficult enough to justify that much min-maxing unless you're going for superbosses. This has the knock on effect of making most of the characters largely interchangeable outside of small details like Limit Breaks. And for the modern ports specifically, the achievements here are kind of uninspired: mostly just the ""Collect all the things"" ""fill all the meters"" ""kill superboss"" sort of ones. It would have been neat to see more creative ones, such as encouraging challenge runs but that's a criticism I have for achievements in general in video games; nothing specific to FFVII.

Regardless, I think it is well worth the play. Cloud's story really is excellent, lots of exploration of trauma and memory and is well presented too. The wider overall plot of the game can be...a bit uneven in tone and intelligibility sometimes, but there's a good amount of humor and tragedy and character moments. The soundtrack is as memorable as ever, combat is fun when the fights last long enough to let you show off, and the characters are visually and narratively interesting (if same-y in combat).

On the technical side, the pitch blurb on the Store page advertises cloud saving but doesn't tell you that it only works through Square's account service, not through Steam (like almost every other game on this platform.....) so if you don't enable the function in the game's launcher and you uninstall the game, well, say good bye to your local saves. (joke here about Cloud saving....)

There are tens of hours in this game literally catching, riding, breeding, training, and winning chocobo races (if you so choose), major optional bosses that could take you 30-60 minutes to beat, and a story, that if you can get emotionally invested in at all, that will be well worth it. <-- though the translation was not the greatest and you shouldn't set your expectations to the moon.

I'm giving this a thumbs down even though I do like FF7 because, in a vanilla state, you have to make a square enix account and log in to even play the game. This is free, but it is absolutely necessary. This makes playing the game on the steam deck a pain. but I'm talking vanilla.

Now, This is what I did. You may very well wish to not do this, but I downloaded the Satsuki Yatoshi Mod and am using that. It is a simple process, you just download the mod and follow the direction which is as easy as unzipping a zip file and running an exe. This increases the size of the game to around 35GB, so keep that in mind, but this mod upscales backgrounds, improves FMVs, updates models, replaces the midi music with music from the PSX version and so on.

I would say ff7 og is a good game. Played it as a kid and playing it again as an adult and I would say the game was definitely much better in my memories. I remembered the game being much more profound and amazing back then. Which I guess as a child it's kind of to be expected. Playing it over as an adult and while the game is still good. The turn based style of retro final fantasy, collecting materia, collecting summons, and even the side quests. I enjoyed revisiting this world and doing all the shit I did as a child. It is still ff7. However the story is much simpler, much less dense than I thought it was. There were just not that many moments for character development even within the main story, and the side quests you do barely contribute much to the story either. If you don't like a character in your party, be prepared to not even notice they're around at all. Nanaki, Cait Sith, and Vincent who? When you spend 50~60 hours dicking around doing side quests and grinding AP for materia mastery, and so on and so forth. The game sort is just a grindfest, which for my nostalgic enjoyments of this game, is something I could put up with.

But if another game had 60 hours of grinding where I didn't already consume media from this world for the past 20 or so years, and develop bonds with these characters beyond the original franchise? I would probably not have made it that far into that game. 

FF7 remake for all the flaws I think it has, that it didn't really tell the story of the original that well, at the very least when comparing to that, did spend time developing the characters bonds and relationships way more than this game. And flesh out the conflict between you and shinra and the world at large. In the original, I'm not even sure why I liked Aerith so much. I barely spent time with her. And one date at golden saucer does not make for much development.

idk, game's good, it's now in my opinion, a bit overhyped. The remake is doing better at rectifying some of the flaws the OG has, but it's also doing seemingly its own thing differently from the original which is kind of meh, which maybe in retrospect is a good thing, because the original ff7 does not have much going for it narratively. There's maybe two good story beats in the OG and it's midgar and kalm, and then the rest of the game is just you are a battering ram and the story is paper, It's very simple and straightforwards and it felt like no investment by the end of the game.",1588108455,1655673721,True,0,0,0.502590715885162354,0,True,False,False

To actually say what I think of the game without being egocentric maniac trying to be a funny man online, Final Fantasy VII is a fantastic game that if you haven't played this game yet. You are doing yourself a huge disservice by not playing it. The characters are well developed coupled with backstories and the story makes you feel so many emotions. For being the first Final Fantasy to be non-sprite based, It does it's job for what you expect Final Fantasy to be. This game is held in such high regard and is special to lots of people due to it A) having a great story with lovable and developed characters or B) It's their first FF. In short whilst I was actually trying to be a funny guy on the internet, this game is amazing and FF VII should be at least given a shot by everyone (But I won't tell you what happens because spoilers).

This game's fame overshadows some of its greater faults that can quite easily be observed by a newcomer. Nevertheless, it is still a fantastic game with a great story, setting, soundtrack and characters (minus the optional ones)

The gameplay is quite straightforward, classic FF ATB gameplay which can feel a bit slow at times especially with the summons but otherwise works fine. Keep in mind that this is a PS1 game and thus has retained a lot of rust from back in the day, some of it which gives it its charm. 
The game isn't super difficult either, and can easily be played and enjoyed by someone new to JRPGs. 
A surprising amount of role-playing is done in this game too, something you're not used to seeing in most JRPGs these days, and the grand exploration adds to that feeling of a real open role-playing experience.

The setting of the game is incredibly unique and one that is very relevant to current world problems in regards to environmentalism and corporatism.
FF7's story does a poor job of explaining the antagonists motives (at least their endgame motivation) but still does a great job at making them seem threatening. Most other characters had a rather spread out development throughout the game which is always great to see rather than them confining it to one single arc. Again it isn't perfect but it certainly works. 

Not the best JRPG or Final Fantasy game for that matter, but one that I consider my favorite simply because it was my first and introduced me to the series. Still a great game overall though like I said. Worth a buy, would recommend you use mods to speed up the framerate though.",1655069852,1655070586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For one you need a Square Enix account just to play a SINGLE PLAYER game from 1997, and it seriously lacks a ton of basic stuff. Setting up the controls is a real pain, because you can't configure both the D-pad and the thumbsticks to do the same thing, so you have to decide which control method you want to toss out entirely instead of switching between them whenever you want. I like using the D-pad for menus but the left thumbstick for moving around in-game, and they won't let me do that here. There are also no button prompts, instead replacing it with vaguely defined actions, which screws things up a ton, especially some of the mini-games which seriously rely on you pressing specific buttons at the right time. The CPR mini-game (which is part of the main story by the way) was an absolute pain because I had to spend 5 minutes fumbling with the controls trying to find out which button does which. There are some really nice accessibility cheats in the PS4 and Switch versions that let you fast forward, disable encounters, and one that even heals your entire party instantly. They sound overpowered, but this is an old game and newer players, especially those not used to old RPGs will definitely appreciate those features to be there if they want to use them. At least the fast forward because the game can get a little slow every now and then. BUT of course the PC version of this game has NONE of those, and is instead just an extremely bare bones port that adds absolutely nothing of value that the other versions don't already have and so much more.

I'd say your only reasons for buying this version are either if you've already played it before and you want to try playing with mods, or you don't have any other means of playing this game.

Great characters, great gameplay, phenomenal story, and good pacing. The graphics are really the only hinderance, but it's relatively easy to look past them and look at the characters instead.

This game does have random encounters, but they don't deter from exploration. The chance is low and unless you're traveling a long distance, you won't run into that many enemies. It never felt like a chore to explore the area.

It's turn-based combat, par for the course for standard RPGs. It feels rewarding to win and the leveling up system is fairly straightforward. The only gripe I had with the combat is that the enemy will keep taking their turns even if you don't take your turn. Other than that the combat is great.

Some want to be with it, some want to BE IT. Others think FF7RE is better and they are wrong. This is an OG, certified, hood classic and deserves that title for a reason. Encounter rate in my mind is a little high, and alot of the subtleties of 7's mechanics and eccentric details like how you get Yuffie early etc are annoying and obtuse at times because the game can be either really easy or difficult depending largely on your knowledge of it, which sounds obvious but isnt once you've played it. Alot of JRPG's are like this, especially ones with alot of plot-based progression. 7 is a somewhat more free and expressive entry in the series with a *somewhat* less linear feel and model for its systems and how you can interact with them, but nonetheless its still a plot-driven JRPG that can drag at times and be too brief at others. Its not THAT long or deep but if you want to dive into it you can do so at your leisure. It doesnt demand any of the genres tropes such as grinding or wiki/forum-browsing for optimal play. As a sidenote, I consider X to be the better entry for first timers to FF simply because its far less dated and clunky. The ATB system is also not a good indicator of the rest of the series unless you keep it set to ""Wait"" so combat has a semi-unique pace and feel to the rest of the franchise. Regardless, its worth the price and time invested but isnt that great on repeat playthroughs due to the on-rails nature of the plot and how the mechanics/systems can largely be dependant on that plots progress. With all that said dont get the wrong idea of my statements, this is far from a mixed-bag of a game. Its wonderful and whimsically charming in all ways it could be but does suffer from the comparatively MONUMENTAL jump in presentation/gameplay the later entries offer. 7 is a great entry in the franchise and is a MUST PLAY for all video game enthusiasts. Historically, this game marks the departure from 2D-sprite based RPG gameplay being the gold-standard and instead reminds us that presentation, aesthetic, and clarity plays just as big a role as mechanics when it comes to JRPG's. So whether you're new to the genre/franchise or familiar you'll be able to appreciate its qualities independantly.

It set the standard for JRPGs at the time of its release in 1997, and has been re-released on many platforms since its debut on the original PlayStation. I admittedly own this game on every available platform and my first proper experience with it took place when the PS4 version came out. Unfortunately, I was too young to appreciate the complex themes of FF7 when I was young, but I kept seeing videos about it on YouTube when I got a bit older.

If you missed it the first time around, or have somehow have managed to ignore everything to do with the game up until this point (well done), I highly recommend that you play this before FF7 Remake. Going into the remake after experiencing the original has interesting results, and you may be interested in checking out the other games in the FF7 canon, such as Crisis Core. However, if you're someone who enjoys pouring over video game lore, ""The Legend of Final Fantasy"" is an excellent analysis of such a colossal universe.

In short, FF7 does something that other games do not, and I'm playing through it again - it's such a wonderful experience. The world, characters, and story are a good representation of what to normally expect in a FF game, and of course it has the classic turn-based JRPG combat.

This is really impressive for a game that initially released way back in 1997, barely a full year after my birth, on a series that has gotten 8 other main game entries. No other Final Fantasy game has had near the success that VII has, and it's not hard to see why.

FF VII was the first Final Fantasy game to be released for the Playstation 1, and in my opinion, can still outclass games put out today, even though it operates on what is now defunct technology. The turn-based combat was nothing new even at its time, but you don't have to be innovative to be good. There's the standard attacking and magic system that everyone's used to, but there are also summons and limit breaks that function as a sort of special move, and you can unlock multiple limit breaks per character by leveling them up and choosing which you prefer.

Even the magic system strayed outside of the bounds of typical mage-play. This system used Materia, which were equippable items, and depending on the materia that you equipped to certain characters, this could give them different magic abilities to use, or certain buffs, or other random attributes that was a cool way to build your character outside of just upgrading your armor and weapon.

SE-PHI-ROTH! ""One Winged Angel"" could be argued as one of the most iconic videogame songs of all time, and honestly set the tone for Final Fantasy being so highly regarded in terms of soundtrack. All of the music is pleasant, and even the victory theme has become a sort of anthem for gamers' achievements. It's really cool to hear all of these songs and sounds in-game after having heard them in other sorts of places for a long while now.

FF VII was my first experience with secret bosses as well, which is always such a cool feature to have in games. The Ruby and Emerald Weapon fights were so crazy hard and so cool, and they're not even remotely required to finish the game. I can't imagine how cool it would've been to discover something like that before the days of internet and having all of the guides and information you could want at your fingertips.

I'd highly recommend this to any Final Fantasy fans, though it's likely that anyone entwined in the series already either played this as their first entry or played it after hearing how influential it was for the series. That said, it would make an excellent first game as someone who hasn't yet delved into the series too!",1649969105,1649969105,True,7,1,0.614795327186584473,0,True,False,False

Before you run over and watch ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"", play this game and read the ""Lateral Biography: TURKS - The Kids Are Alright"" short story, because the movie is a direct sequel to this game and the Lateral Biography bridges them both, even though the lead isn't Cloud Strife or one of the Turks, but Even Townshend, a private eye. Be aware that this is just a fan translation brought to you by TheLifestream.net. Unless, if ya pay for my airplane ticket, get me a good translator, and show me where the SE headquarters are at, I'd beg for an international translation of this short story (and the Before Crisis game). - Since this story is part of the whole huge world building of FF7 as a whole.

It is a good game.

It's a good game that lays a foundation for future 3d + instance final fantasy games 8,9,x,12 etc. However if you don't pay attention you can get lost very easily. Even with paying attention some of the ""tasks"" are just randomly talking to someone you've alreayd talked to, after doing something else. So when you don't know what to do you end up talking to every single person in an area over, and over, and over.

Manometer: 7/10[/b]


The good
- Great world design. Steampunk/fantasy environments are so imaginative and convincing. The word is immersive, big and feels alive. Each place and village is visually unique and hides a small story.
- Gorgeous graphics. Prerendered backgrounds have tons of details and a high artistic value. Cut scenes videos are technically far ahead of its time.
- Fantastically designed, unforgettable characters. Well written dialogues. Each of them has a solid, unique personality and a rich backstory that is revealed gradually. You will love the main characters (such as Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Aeris). You will sympathize some of the bad guys too. Even the more insignificant NPCs have something interesting to tell you.
- Genius music. This is one of the best soundtracks ever written for a video game with both energetic and relaxing tracks. Some of them can stick in your mind.
- Deep gameplay. There are so many materia, items, abilities to discover and unlock. There are so many ways to evolve your characters and there are much more different strategies to follow.
- Good battle system. You will need some time to get used of it but after a while the battles become one of the most addictive elements of the game. Animations and sounds can give you great pleasure. Also there is a big variety of enemies and mini bosses so that they never get boring or repetitive.
- Cool, dark atmosphere full of innerness and romanticism. Dreamy moments, memories and flashbacks will give you some strong emotions.
- The plot is deep and imaginative and it is based on an interesting fantasy concept. Action and relaxing moments are in balance and the story has good pace during the first half of the game. Unfortunately things change drastically at the second half.
- It is a great cinematic experience for its time with good direction and cinematography. Unlike most of the RPGs back then (that had a fixed angled or top-down orthographic main camera), ""Final Fantasy VII"" uses lenses with different filed of view and cameras in various angles. So it achieves to enhance the atmosphere and the action of each screen.
- It has a clever, distinguishing sense of humor. It is hilarious at least until it gets too serious.
- There is a lot of extra content besides the main story. Easter eggs, activities, items, characters are scattered around the world waiting for you to discover them. It also packs some ultra harsh optional enemies if you want something more challenging.
- It comments on the ecological problem along with issues about society's structure, big corporations politics etc. giving you food for thought.
- It is cheap when it goes on sale considering that this is one of the most popular RPGs out there.

The bad
- Although the initial establishment and the story are solid, emotional and well balanced, halfway it gets messy, pompous and ostentatious. It seems like in an attempt to impress they tried to fit in as many showy things as they could. The main characters go almost everywhere. They fight on trains, airplanes, motorcycles, submarines, rockets. They shoot, explode things, summon mythical creatures and... parachute. They go underwater, in caves, at snowy wastelands, in outer space and finally underground near the planet's center. Some things make no sense at all and some plot twists seem too pretentious. Unfortunately with all this mess it sometimes feels like a cheap action movie you cannot take for serious. Also there are many cliché things (like the big bad guy that talks a lot and seeks for limitless power and the self sacrificed heroes that want to save the whole planet).
- Control mechanics have some serious problems. The characters tent to stuck here and there when moving while sometimes you don't understand where to go because of the unclear backgrounds' perspective. Interacting with objects inside the world is unresponsive and constantly you try to find the exact interaction point by luck. Most importantly, during the battles there are some cameras that make it impossible to choose the right character causing annoying defeats.
- Random encounters are frustrating. I felt that they were totally ruining the game's flow and atmosphere. The worst of all is that I wasn't feeling free to explore places. I was always in a hurry to avoid more unwanted battles. The sound and visual effect when entering a battle is probably the most tiresome thing I've met in a video game.
- Summons' animations are way too big with a result of ruining battle's pace. They should have been the battle's climax instead of getting you bored every time you summon Bahamut Zero.
- Most mini games are silly and don't fit the rest of the game's aesthetics. Snowboard level is badly designed.",1621468142,1646433792,True,3,1,0.535338819026947021,0,True,False,False

[/table]
So, this is [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i]. The nostalgic dork in me can't really recommend it enough; it's a genre-redefining title that really brought JRPGs into the mainstream.

It's a tough game for me to clearly review for anyone looking to get into it. I've played it so many times - [i]including an ~11-hour speedrun[/i] - and read and talked so much about it that it feels like I know it inside-out: the developers and its development, its story and backstory, its mechanics, everything. Nevertheless:

[list]
    [*][b][u]It's a piece of gaming history.[/u][/b] [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i] didn't bring JRPGs to the west (we'd had at least 8 other [i]FF[/i] titled precede it, and hundreds of other games like them across platforms), but it definitely brought the genre into the mainstream. The soccer kids who bullied me for smuggling a Game Boy in the pocket of my cargo pants were talking about how to breed chocobos at the lunch table months later. Kids passed around and hid the strategy guide in their desks in English class. [i]I have teenage students talking about this game more than twenty years later[/i] - not just the remake (though, maybe now [i]because of[/i] the remake...).
    [*][b][u]The materia system is great.[/u][/b] It's a small pain in the earliest stages of the game, and it eventually becomes pretty easily-exploitable, but finding those ""exploits"" is part of what makes it fun in the first place. Equipping and using magic in this game is like a game in itself.
    [*][b][u]The characters are iconic.[/u][/b] (Except Cid.) There's that word again. While some of them are unevenly-developed, and several are walking-talking-tropes (lookin' at you, Barret), they're well-executed in the narrative. Combined with the art direction (which considers its original graphical capabilities/limitations), the characters come to life in ways that modern games of any genre no longer do, and may never again without changing their delivery. It's like watching a Saturday Morning Cartoon version of some dark classic sci-fi, and I'm here for it.
[/list]
In spite of its history/status, my nostalgia, and the gameplay elements that help it stay strong nowadays, the Steam release has its share of flaws.

It doesn't appear as though any bugs have been fixed from the original release. MDEF is still apparently meaningless, and all clipping/glitching/exploits/etc. remain intact (making aforementioned speedrun possible). The graphics look weird in spots on HD displays (did you know that the character models originally had [i]mouths[/i]? You can see them in this version, and it's...[i]weird[/i]).

Since I'm (apparently) practically incapable of gushing about [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i]: Whether you're coming to this for the nostalgia, or starting anew, it bears saying: this is only [i]mostly[/i] the original game.

STORY
FFVII's story is tremendous and, at the time of release, deliberately went against the grain. It's still a great story now, although it's often confusingly conveyed, and the addition of more entries in the FFVII universe, some of which are even more confusing or outright contradictory, has only exacerbated the situation. The world is gigantic and runs the gamut between bleak and charming. The characters are deep, compelling, and memorable. And the story takes the player on an emotional journey fraught with twists and turns. What's more, FFVII features something that many modern games have forgotten: multiple unique instances of integration of story and gameplay. I would recommend this game on the writing alone. 10/10.

GAMEPLAY
The game is a party-based JRPG using Final Fantasy's Active Time Battle system, where every participant in a battle has a bar that fills up over time. Once the bar fills up, the character can act, emptying the bar. This gives FFVII's turn-based battle system an element of real-time interaction and decision-making. Characters can be customized using the Materia system, which allows players to transform just about any character into what they want or need, whether that be a frontline fighter, a mage, a cleric, etc. The sheer amount of Materia and the number of ways they can be combined make for a very deep customization system. Every character also has a set of cinematic special attacks called Limit Breaks. Otherwise, the player is asked to explore a massive world, traverse dungeons, and solve puzzles: standard JRPG fare. However, it's not perfect. Battles are either pointlessly easy or weirdly difficult. Controlling movement is clunky and in some minigames byzantine, complicated by forced camera angles. It can be difficult to distinguish between objects the characters can interact with and the environment. While character customization is extremely deep battles rarely are. These flaws hold back an otherwise excellent game. 8/10.

LOOKS
FFVII came out in 1997, so it's no surprise that by modern standards, it looks like crap. In 1997 I'm sure quite a few minds were blown by the inclusion of FMVs in the gameplay and flashy summon animations, but unlike 2D sprite graphics which are now retro and timeless FFVII has not aged well. Unfortunately, 3/10 by modern standards, but at the time FFVII was cutting edge and would have been a 10/10.

VALUE
This is a long JRPG, and there's a crapton of stuff to do, some of which is permanently missable. Even just blundering through and only following the main story it's probably a 30 hour game. The world is sprinkled with secrets (some of which are completely inscrutable, like I have no idea how anybody could be expected to discover them), mini-games, and sidequests, many of which would be extremely difficult without a guide. Even better, this game is ancient, which means it's pretty cheap. The only problem is that since it takes so long, there's a substantial opportunity cost, and I can't say that everything in FFVII is worth doing. 9/10.

OTHER NOTABLES
Nobuo Uematsu's music is incredible.

OVERALL
30/40. 7.5/10, most of the points lost being because its graphics now look terrible. This is a wonderful and legendary JRPG which deserves its popularity. Unfortunately, this has also caused Square Enix to revisit the universe with mixed results, because money.

I was 11 years old, and thus I obtained my first PlayStation. I'd never played an RPG of any kind before, or even any games that required very much reading to get through; I was more of a Tony Hawk, Pokemon Snap kind of kid. I was also exceptionally dumb, and when, in the very first pseudo-boss fight of the game with that stupid red scorpion, Barrett kept telling me, ""Attack when its tail is up!"", I took him at his literal word, and kept getting laser murdered. Looking up an answer to my dilemma online could not have occurred to 2001 Me. I shrugged, relegated the game to the basement bin, and went back to Tony Hawk.

Ten years later, when grandpa passed away, I decided that it was finally time. I was older now, smarter, and I KNEW I could defeat not only that stupid laser scorpion, but the evil Shinra Corporation and Sephiroth himself. And so I did, and then I cried, because I'd finally forkin done it. For grandpa, who thought I'd really like it all those years ago.

As somebody who rarely plays JRPG's in general despite working on one, Final Fantasy VII had always been regarded as a gaming classic no matter who you were. Yet for me, this game never came into my mind until the remake hit PC on the blasted Epic Games client.

The game had been on my mind when a coworker of mine had told me about it and I told them that whenever it hit PC, I'd gladly play it. Even if that meant giving up a portion of my gaming loyalty to Lord Gaben. 

Despite that and the tears a shed over it's price, i bought the remake and loved it from start to finish. But in the end, I knew that I had to play the original FF7 for the simple fact of, what was it that i missed all those years ago.

And well... honestly. It should be illegal to keep playing games without playing FF7. 

It took me a total of twenty three years to play FF7. 

23 years. 

That alone is my punishment.

[h1]Review[/h1]
It should come without question that Final Fantasy VII shaped the gaming industry and RPG's as we know it. Many internet and gaming historians will gladly monologue for hours with you of what Final Fantasy VII did for it's time. As a game created back in 1997, we already know the story of what it accomplished then but in 2022, we are still hearing more about the FF7 universe with many of us both old and new Final Fantasy fans eagerly awaiting the future parts of the remake. 

That being said I'm not recommending FF7 for it's prestige alone, rather instead I'm recommending it for the fact that this game nearly three decades later has still aged like a fine wine. Sure the graphics have aged terribly, but the story, gameplay, features, and scale is something that i feel this new age of gamers have yet to still experience.

As a matter of fact, experience is the best way to describe FF7. It's not a great game for it being some crazy innovative and moddable piece of gaming such as Skyrim and Minecraft. FF7 doesn't pride itself on being a game you play for it's playtime, it's a game that gives you an experience so good that you replay it to relive it's convoluted story, revolutionary characters that created the cliches, and a unmatched soundtrack.

This isn't even the tip of the iceberg that is FF7. I haven't even dug into the list of mini games at the Gold Saucer such as the battle arena, grinding for a Gold Chocobo, moments and cutscenes such as the motorbike, Cloud infiltrating Don Corneo, and materia system. FF7 is without a doubt a game with more than just one thing it exceeds at which led to it's universe being grown substantially over the years. 

The odds of another FF7 ever coming to the world is possibly slim to none. A marvel such as this game has seen it's fair share of clones and inspired creators who to this very day have yet to even accomplish a small number of it's accolades. It's unfathomable to how much this game achieved all those years ago and how it's legacy still remains untouched. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Final Fantasy VII may have aged graphically and does have it's fair share of exploits and bugs that can be abused, but even these few shortcomings honestly add more to it's legacy. Final Fantasy VII isn't a game for that matter, it is as i stated before, an experience. 

Something I believe a lot of games should start aiming to create more of, for the simple fact that everything in this game (outside of the Gold Chocobo grind) has been created to accomplish just that.

This is the best way to play the original FF7. They upped the resolution of the graphics which makes it look much nicer than the PS1 version, but it still looks like the same game, and they fixed a few serious game breaking bugs from the original (such as the Magic Defense that doesn't work on armor in the original). Otherwise, everything is the same, everything runs great, and the achievements are perfectly fine (unlike most square enix games that have awful achievements). It's a much better port than FF8 or FF9 steam ports. This is also a better version than a lot of the ports that are on consoles like PS4.

If you're looking to get more out of this game, there is also a huge modding community for FF7 and pretty much all mods are made to run on this version of the game.

Graphics - Blocks, sweet delicious blocky textures, even snakes look rectangular upon dying. Sephiroth? He had such a square jaw that Clould could use it to grate some cheese to be honest. Could use Cloud's sword as a somewhat decent cheese grater too.

Fighting - Still learning how to make it better and it did well, summons, magic, swords, ninjas and fist, a mopey old guy named Vincent who still likes pretty kawaii for his age. Decent battle system and all, bigger weapons, bigger damage. <3

Soundtrack - Aside from VIII and XIII saga, this is probably my favorite soundtrack out of the whole series (sans Gilgamesh's theme <3 ) Although the soundtrack suffers from Final Fantasy syndrom at times where happy or sad music plays at incredibly unfitting times....

Story - Neo-Resistance group finds that their actions uncover they actually were doing good in the wrong way and they go on a quest to stop an insane guy with an overly long hair that needs a haircut and attittude adjustment and stop a corrupt orginazation and Hojo at the same time. All the whole, discovering real memories, friendship, romance, Nanaki, food, villiages, weapons, really large weapons you have to fight, more villages, a crater, and a chick who dies too early.

The only downside to this game is if you decide to use an Xbox 360 controller, you need to mod some of the game files so the buttons are mapped correctly as the game will NOT give you the option to edit the controller scheme for an Xbox based controller.

Final Fantasy VII is a very special game. Very much a product of it's time, yet still holding a message that we can learn from today. What starts out as a crusade against Shinra to stop them from killing the planet becomes a globe spanning adventure to ultimately save the planet and learn a little about or cast along the way. It's clear to see where a lot of the style of this game came from. It is very by the by a 90's anime influenced piece of work. Between the designs of the characters and the general world, you wouldn't be wrong to say this game is an amalgamation of what made 90's Japan a pretty cool media outlet. You have your bio-organics, plain old mechs, and a few designs the creators lifted from Gundam and changed up a little here. Despite taking quit a bit from the anime of the times, the world really comes into it's own. Starting out in Midgar, you take your party through a ton of varied and beautiful pre-rendered areas that are so striking that you'll find yourself taking a few moments just to appreciate the art direction this game has. Despite the game being early 3D, it has a charm to it that you can feel even to this day. Your party members are also a great example of the overall art style and variety this game has. Each one of them have a unique look and you might be hard-pressed to choose your main party as you go through this game. 

The music for this game is definitely one of the highlights here and played no small part in putting Final Fantasy VII on the map.  Nobuo Uematsu and his team of composers did quite an amazing job on this game. It's incredibly varied and each track seems to hit a new chord with the player and fits the areas perfectly. 

The gameplay is your typical JRPG fare, with a twist! This twist is the materia system. The materia system is a pretty fun and enjoyable way to allow the player to have freedom of character growth and make their party the roles they want them to be. With the proper set up and a little thought, you can make any of your party members fit the healer, support, mage roles, or even get rid of those roles entirely and have your own fun with everything spread out between all of your party. This system allows for a ton of flexibility and definitely makes this game have a little more depth for the player. As you play you'll probably see ways to abuse this system and get the most out of it. Honestly, for someone like me, breaking games with their own systems is half the fun, and FF7 has this in spades.

At the end of the day, if you're a fan of JRPGs, or just want to see why people love this game and still hail it, why not give it a shot? You might find your next new time sink.",1642404368,1642404390,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overworld graphics can be a bit rough at times. The cutscenes, in-game models, and 
scenery backdrops hold up surprisingly well, though I'd be lying if I said they didn't show their age. I'd argue however, that the game still holds up, despite that.

The materia system allows for a deep level of customization, and this is without mentioning all of the different combinations and their various interactions.

The music is iconic, for good reason. Good luck trying to get the various ear worms out of your head once you've heard them.

I won't even bother trying to explain the story. It's a Final Fantasy game. The story is super convoluted, yet still manages to hold it's own charm.


You've got lots of side content (Chocobo breeding/racing anyone?) to keep you distracted while you chase down the main story.

There's some real challenges near the end of the game in the form of super bosses, if you're looking for that, though they can be cheesed with specific strategies and set-ups.

FFVII is one of those games that I'm able to pick up and just replay when the mood strikes.

FF7 takes place in a gritty, steampunk world that adds a lot to the atmosphere.
The first Final Fantasy game with 3D characters and environments.
The Steam release comes with extra convenience features, such as level boost (required SquareEnix account).

[b]» Flaws: «[/b]

It is a famous PC port that cost Eidos $1.000.000 to make, sadly it is just as buggy today.
 
[b]» Verdict: «[/b]

Although the game did not age well, the story and the characters are still great.
One of the classics and a favourite for many FF fans.
If you like Square's series, this needs to be in your library.

Ahora, hablare de lo mas resaltante de esta obra, a mi parecer,(cabe resaltar que yo no sentí ningún tipo de nostalgia ya que nunca jugué ningun FF)
Somos cloud y vamos a hacer un atentado pare evitar la sobreexplotación de un recurso altamente vital para la subsistencia industrial, aunque a cloud solo le importa el dinero.
De por sí en la primera hora nos introducen personajes con buen carisma y personalidad, la introducción es directa y rapida, lo cual destaco porque en otros final fantasys se demora algo para darnos un contexto basico de la historia.
Los mapas los encuentro algo divertidos y atrapantes, el soundtrack es igual de bueno y es de lo mas destacable de la entrega.
Tras haberlo jugado por solo 4 horas me resulta imposible dar un veredicto final debido al hecho de no haberlo completado, pero hasta ahora me resulta una de las mejores cosas que he podido comprar en steam.

Psdt:Me resulta jodidamente tedioso ponerle mods, la versión de steam ya está bien de por sí.",1641270016,1641270016,True,0,0,0.46875,0,True,False,False

1/ you need to log into a Square Enix member account to open your game. Too bad that membership thing is super clunky and not documented. I had to browse the community messages to get passed that. Why is it my (well, the community's) job to fix Square Enix's stuff? Isn't that their job?

2/ The game menu (control selection, graphics, etc.) is the worst I've seen in probably over two decades. Unusable. The good thing is that this is a simple game so you don't need any fancy keyboard setup. But still. That shows how much effort Square Enix put into this game (ie: none).

3/ The game itself is EXTREMELY pixellized. And don't get me wrong, I definitely remember what PS1 games looked like and I played tons of ports on my PC. This one is shockingly bad. What used to be gorgeous hand-drown backgrounds are now just a trash of huge pixels. Disguting.

Honestly, given the stature of this game (this is FF7, probably one of the biggest video game of all time, remember?), Square Enix could have done a little more than the bare minimum. 

To Square Enix people: if you're not willing to put the work in it, just don't do it. Stealing is much worse than not servicing your clients. I'm never buying any ""old"" game (ports) from you. Not to mention that I'll read through the community's comments before buying any ""new"" game from you. You should be ashamed.

To Steam people: I totally understand you're here to sell stuff. But in such cases, you should have a very clear notation system to tell potential buyers the community isn't happy with the game as is. Otherwise, that make you an accomplice. You can be ashamed too. A disgrace given the quality of the Steam product as a whole.

[i]Final Fantasy VII[/i] has been on my radar for a long time. I know the characters, I've listened to the amazing soundtrack, I've even enjoyed that most forbidden fruit, the CIoudxSephiroth fanfiction... but since I never owned the original Playstation, I never got to actually play it. Now that I have, what did I think?

Firstly, I loved being thrown into the action right away. No tutorials, you're immediately doing something exciting. I also appreciated how there were no difficult gameplay mechanics to learn off the bat - I can see how this game would've appealed even to non-RPG fans, or those that hadn't played RPGs before. The game starts you off in the city of Midgar, a kind of cyberpunk technopolis crossed with industrial slum, full of personality and charm. Running round the different Sectors, evading the law, meeting and getting to know each character, while slowly learning more about the world and story...this was wonderful, and for me the best part of the game.

Once you leave Midgar, the pace slows considerably and things become similar to other [i]Final Fantasy[/i]s, wandering round the world map, working out where to go and slowly moving the plot forward. It isn't bad by any means but I missed the breakneck speed of the early game. On the other hand, the Materia system was interesting without being too complicated to understand, and I enjoyed the increased battle options it opened up - Magic, Summons, Commands, etc.

I was a little surprised that the game wasn't longer. It's not a short game of course, but my experience of JRPGs that came after FFVII - [i]Skies of Arcadia[/i], [i]Tales of Symphonia[/i] - prepared me for something longer by at least 10 hours. I was able to beat the game and get all achievements in around 70 hours. Additionally, I was somewhat nonplussed by how certain characters and story elements seemed to be finished with in kind of a rushed manner. Again, maybe that's me judging the game by the standards of what came after.

If there was once thing I disliked, it was the Gold Saucer area. None of the minigames were any fun in my opinion, some being downright frustrating, and the whole GP system was irritating. But you don't have to spend much time there if you don't want to.

So for the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i]. I can see how influential it was to JRPGs in the 3D-era, and how many of the creative and humourous little touches echo down into modern indie-RPGs. Though it wasn't as polished as perhaps I was expecting, I could understand its enduring appeal, there's something very likeable about the characters and setting. I look forward to going through the game a second time, to see all the things I missed on my first playthrough... and to experience that Midgar early-game again.",1605204544,1640888686,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

For years I've avoided this game, mainly going by the kind of reviews that currently plague this Steam page.  But, I decided to take a leap of faith, and guess what?  The game is awesome, and highly recommended if you've been playing the PSX version through an emulator to get slightly better graphics, and especially to those that have been rocking the older PC version, which was buggy and contaned inferior music tracks.  Let's check off the list of improvements, eh?

- Overall smoother looking graphics AND backgrounds

- Same music as the original PlayStation game

- ""Easy"" mode that boosts all of your stats so you just enjoy the story (requires Cloud save and to be online)

- Can be modded if you want (though outside of Steam)

To be clear, you DO have to create a Square Enix account, but I've only had to login once and never again.  Try that with your Origin or UbiPlay games.  And to all those people complaining about have to be online, this is what happens if you want Cloud saving and are online with Steam.  If you don't want this, turn off Cloud saving and you can take Steam offline.  You lose the ability to use your save between computers, but you can also be offline all the time.

Now, things aren't perfect, but this is more indicative to it being based on the PC game.  While I am primarily a PC gamer, FFVII just feels unnatural on the keyboard.  I'm sure that if I played a few hours I wouldn't care, but right now thinking about juggling all that materia whilst using the keyboard gives me the cold sweats.  Luckily, it does have partial controller support.  You know the drill for Steam; get a compatible controller or an app that can get you own working.

So, to recap:  This game rocks!  You have to create a SQ account, but since you only login once, I don't see what is the big deal.  I mean, you have to login into Steam to get this far, don't you?  Plus, you get to cheat right out of the box (no mods required).  So, if you've always wanted to get a better looking version of FFVII, or haven't played the game but was curious as to why it is lauded so, go ahead and pick this game up.

EDIT: Years later and I would like to add that while I've signed into and downloaded FF7 on Steam literally dozens of times over the years on many different machines (most of them NOT Windows) I've still yet to sign in more than that first time to the SQ account!",1483201394,1640789750,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

And lots of silly little things you only get to do once in the whole game.

FF7 is not difficult to breeze through if you understand the basics of the tactical system and you can further trivialize the entire story mode with a short grinding session on disc 1, or a little insight into how some of the lategame materia works, routinely using Steal and Morph, or hell, just saving regularly. The hardest unavoidable fight in the game comes smack in the middle of it.

Music's nice, minigames are fun, every boss is a very cool fight that you look forward to on next playthrough. Chocobo breeding is by far the worst part of the game. If you get too rich you can throw money at your problems and it ignores their armor.

Playing the PC ""remake"" intergrade really made me want to play this again, for more than a few reasons.  I believe turn-based combat is pretty integral to the game. Action, pressing the X button repeatedly against Shinra soldiers may make for cool looking trailers, but actual boss fights turn into tedium, long, drawn out fights, rather than actual strategic ones like in the original. 

Which is another cool thing about the original, it's as hard or as easy as you want. You can get the enemy skill materia earlier on and beat sephiroth by using bubbles, or you can level up standard materia and play however you like. A lot of the things to complain about the remake for are because it's so short. where's my bahamut summon? oh right, they havent even left midgar yet. Where's Cid? Oh wait, they haven't even seen Rocket town. Why the fuck does Sephiroth keep appearing this early on? Why's there weird purple blood in Shinra tower? Why is everything being padded so hard?

The soundtrack has yet to be bested, the closest the remake came to outperforming it was the airbuster fight in the remake , which was an AWESOME song, and the second phase of the jenova dreameater fight. Most of it takes far too long to get going, while this game's music doesn't fuck around. So many iconic moments, and the biggest tragedy is that the game REALLY gets going after you leave midgar, which is where the remake ends. If you haven't played the original, DO NOT play the remake, I beg you. As an extension to the original, it's not a bad game, but it's horrible for new fans, probably the absolute worst way to start the story.

FF7 is probably square's best game. I'd rather them have made an ARPG remake of Chrono Trigger. That game would have way more sense, and wouldn't have to be split into a bunch of parts. The remake is good, definitely not worth $70 when you can buy this for $5 and have way more content. This game is amazing, if you enjoy turn based and haven't played it, FF6 or FF7 are great intros to turn based games.",1640533100,1640533522,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With this darker atmosphere of technology becoming an asset and enemy, tensions are high; that is not to say that more light-hearted moments exist within it: It is just that it feels a bit different. However, the skill and prowess with which it was created enables it to shine. 

The mysterious, initially aloof mercenary Cloud Strife joins the bio-terrorist organization AVALANCHE to subvert to the mega-corp Shinra Electric Power Company. Along the way, he crosses paths with old friends and new comrades alike throughout the game, but the story ultimately evolves into something far grander as the fate of the planet is at stake at the hands of Sephiroth. Characters become developed and fascinating as the story progresses, being multi-faceted.

The intergration of the Active Time Battle system of combat into battles is very much welcome. The game can be configured into making the difficulty linked with the player's skill level. The Materia system for commands is easy to learn--battling is enjoyable, not grind-heavy. Sounds and themes are of excellent. I find myself listening to the OST often.

After that is done, you are golden to play whenever.

For new players, be cautious, this is a great classic game, amazing, but it is from 90s, not just visually, but over all there are things in here that might seem silly or even odd at times(Don, those who know, know).

[b]Overall: [/b] 4/10

A game that does not stand the test of time unless you are a hardcore fan of FF games or JRPG’s with a case of severe nostalgia. 

[b]Music: [/b] 8/10

The music is actually really good and does stand the test of time. In most cases it does create a wonderful atmosphere. There are a few tracks here and there that feel a bit annoying, but nothing too serious. Overall, really solid, but nothing that will remain in my memory.

[b]Visuals: [/b] 3/10

That score is fully towards the backgrounds and the FMV’s. Those looked really solid for its time. However, the models in game and in battle, are really behind and saying they were something groundbreaking would be an insult considering Mario 64 came one year before and managed to look 10 times better than this game.

[b]Gameplay: [/b] 3/10

A really mediocre combat system which you can simply win with auto-attacks. An insane amount of grinding required to actually have useful Materia and Limit Breaks. Useless mini-games that plague the game from the get-go and don’t add anything. Plus, all the things you need to do to get the ultimate limit breaks. And that is without counting how the game doesn’t help you find the locations, the characters barely interact when meaningful events happen and much more.

[b]Story: [/b] 3.5/10

There is a story and it sort of promises that it can be good. However, the localization errors plus the fact that most characters don’t react to different events or that without a guide, a lot of information is simply not found because you need to go out of your way to access it, means that the story is barely there. 
While some might try and excuse it because of the era. Chrono Trigger came before and it had a better story by far, same as Earthbound and Final Fantasy Tactics that came out the same year.

FF7 is also 24 years old (at time of writing) and it is reaaaally starting to show it's age.

-----------

I'm old, so I played this back in the day as a young teen and thought it was the best thing ever. Replaying it recently as an adult it's a lot easier to criticise and find faults in some of the design choices. 

The combat gameplay is not particularly good, the mid-game story is all a bit of a wild goose chase and - yep, i'm gunna say it - the materia and equipment systems are a chore of endless menus and confusion. The game also looks like a bunch of jagged polygons that kind of hurt your eyes to look at. Because of course it does. It's 24 years old. And you know what? Those things are not that easy to ignore any more.

But still, the story and setting of this game are uniquely charming and captivating.

The first section of the game is amazing, wonderful pacing and good character development, and the story is fairly focused. Throughout the entire stay in Midgar, it manages to keep a great sense of urgency and drive.

Then you leave the city and... all that urgency and direction just vanishes. You're just kind of wandering around aimlessly, and eventually bump into the only direction you can actually go, and kind of wander that way until you randomly run into a nugget of random plot here or there. It loses the sense of direction that the first act had, and yet doesn't replace that with a sense of exploration as you're very obviously being railroaded into one path with little to do outside it. I'm honestly not at all surprised that the remake decided to stop after leaving Midgar, as that whole arc was far better than what came after (and the ""after"" part will probably require extensive rewrites).

Further, the battle system is just unpleasant in my opinion. I hate when games want to mix real-time and turn-based mechanics. I either want to actually [i]control[/i] the character in fully real-time combat (as the remake decided to go with), or have the time to carefully choose what I want a character to do in a fully turn-based combat (as Final Fantasy went back to at least as of FFX). Instead, this game forces me to simply wait for my turn to be ""ready"" (sometimes with me and the monsters just sitting there), while I can't actually look away or else the monsters will continue attacking me despite it being ""my turn"". It's just the worst of both worlds.

I've tried my best to get into this game twice now (as my almost 30 hours spent on the game can attest to), and both times I loved the opening and then slowly lost interest and just couldn't force myself to keep going during the parts after that.

This is among the worst ways to experience the game. It looks worse, has more bugs than, and lacks the QOL features of the modern console releases (and even on PC, the Microsoft Store version). Unlike the original PC release, the port is no longer laughably, entertainingly incompetent, and instead just incompetent enough to be wholly inferior to the original. And on that note, the game runs, looks, sounds, and overall is just worse than the original PS1 version. Many people will say that mods improve this, and there are quite a few mods that help with the backgrounds or the audio quality or the framerate. However, many mods go even further and completely change the way the game looks, sounds, feels, or is written. And while these are still incredibly interesting and passionate mods that should be respected and applauded for the work put into them, they make for a lousy experience with the game outside of the context of ""I want a completely different Final Fantasy VII experience.""

Overall, you should play Final Fantasy VII, but not on Steam. Either play the PS1 version, or if you need the speedup from the modern rereleases, pick any version on any console you like and play it.

UPDATE: While my overall thoughts have not changed, I must add that the online DRM for this title is genuinely inexcusable.

The story, setting, characters, and gameplay combine to make a fun and memorable experience that's worth playing through multiple times.

I love the materia system used for combat, I don't understand why people complain about it because it's the more interesting magic system of any Final Fantasy game. Collecting and levelling up the materia can be a lot of fun, and it gives players more options when deciding which characters to use because anyone can be a mage by equipping the right materia.

There's an in-game arcade with some enjoyable minigames you can play (and win prizes!), and eventually you get the ability to capture, breed, and race chocobos, which is mostly unnecessary for the storyline but happens to be a lot of fun.

On my most recent playthrough I installed the mods ""Symphonic Remasters Redux"", ""The Reunion"", and ""Satsuki Yatoshi Mod - SYW""  to enhance the game's graphics and audio. FF7 had nice graphics for its time but they're now looking pretty dated, so I would recommend installing such mods for first time players. The updated character models aren't as charming as the original, but I do think it's an improvement for the most part. However, I recommend disabling the remastered translation included with The Reunion.

The Switch version of this game is so much better. You need to mod the Steam version just so it looks as good as the Switch one. If you do use mods then it disables achievements. BTW, this Steam port doesn't have the fast-forwards or other enhancements that the Switch port has.

The backgrounds in this game version look downright awful without mods. They upscaled the character models but not the backgrounds when porting this.

They also added creepy-looking mouths to all the models so that half the time they look alright and the other half of the time, they look like creepy lego-movie parodies.

I don't have any nostalgic connections with this game, cus even if I did finish the game as a kid, I skipped every dialogue (I had a brain sized like a peanut) and if I was stuck I'd let my brother play it for me. So, I can't really say I experienced the game fully and this second time felt like a first time, and boy was it a great time.

I'll address the bad before the good, the pacing of the story is dogshit. Especially the start, they don't give you time to think about anything, characters are introduced just for them to not matter in the next hour, a bit slower approach would have been better for this game.

That's all for the bad, now the good. The characters are amazing, I love them a lot and I mean A LOT. Especially Aerith, her cheeky charms were so fun to experience, Cloud as a main character can be a little hard to love at first but he grows on you in time (starts out as the wettest towel out there though). They all have their own unique personalities and their own reasons to do what they do. I also really love the world building, you can feel the effects of Shinra almost everywhere which connects the world of FFVII really well and makes the world feel real. I also really liked Limit as a mechanic, unlike in FFIX where Trance appears in places you don't need and you have no way to save it for bigger fights, Limit works cus its so easy to save. You can unleash a big move and do massive damage or keep it and increase your speed, but you can't use your normal attack that way, but you can use magic or other skills, this gives the player multiple choices in how to approach combat and led to a very nice experience for me.

This game is pretty old now, and yeah the visuals are dated but there's still a lot to love about this classic that shaped the modern games we play now, and somehow it still feels so fresh. I give this game a 7/10.",1574000504,1634051855,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

However, being the first one in the series to take this form, the graphics hasn't really aged well and would probably turn off a lot of those coming from the younger generations just getting started in the series. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up for storytelling and its soundtrack. Two decades later, several video games that served as spinoffs, prequels, and a remake, as well as two films, is a testament to the impact the original game has on the RPG genre.

Final Fantasy VII is the most popular game in the franchise. Everywhere on the internet searching up ""Final Fantasy"" will always show Cloud, Aerith, and other elements and characters from this game. I was only interested in Final Fantasy XV back in the day and try out this game to see what's all the fuss about. 

Positives first, being a very old game this game have a very strong and interesting narrative. I thought the story is gonna be some anime soap opera like Final Fantasy XIII or maybe God Eater, but no. The main story is more interesting than that. The world, lore is very fun to explore throughout the story. The whole story is very long and takes place in many ages without spoiling anything. Kinda suprised how compact the content is for a very small game. Well it did originally came out for the PS1 which uses discs with little roms. But still blew me away how big they manage to fit the story in.

And the characters are amazing. Again, expecting FF7 is gonna be like some tropey anime story in gaming form, all the characters are very unique and blew my expectations away, especially the main character, Cloud. This character is like the icon of edginess or some sh*t when I first learned about him. But Cloud in the story is more than that. Not gonna spoil the whole story but, Cloud became very much my favourite character in the whole game. There's also other amazing characters like Tifa, Aerith, and other party members I won't spoil. The antagonist (I won't spoil but the internet kinda spoiled it already) is very menacing and everytime the characters encounter him has feeling of dread in the atmosphere. Easily one of the most interesting villain I've ever experienced.

The soundtrack of this game is amazing. Again, Nobuo Uematsu is at its prime when this come out. Every track is a certified banger.

The combat system is ok. Having a turn based system and you can customise your party's actions and skills with materia. Materia are magical items that can make your character perform any actions. Think of it like Final Fantasy II but more portable and adaptable. On my first playthrough I breezed through the mechanics to reach the ending fast. But on my second playthrough where I turn the dial down a bit and start to learn and invest in the Materia system, its kinda fun to switch Materias between characters to see how it all plays out. 

For the negatives, kinda hard to mention since its an almost 30 year old game but the visuals can sometimes bleed my eyes out. It really does not age well. Luckily, theres a button to guide the players where the exits and entrances are so you can know what you're doing and seeing. Second, some texts and translation have some mistakes. But I can see how that can be charming to certain players because to show how this franchise started its footing in the international side of things. But in todays' standards, sometimes some sentences the characters just does not make sense and you have to perform multiple mental gymnastics in order to understand whats' being said. And lastly, seeing theres a fast forward button during combat in newer versions, I hope the Steam version also have this feature. There is an option to speed up the battle animation though in the configuration menu. I dunno, maybe the recent Pixel Remasters is spoiling me when it comes to turn based combat.

Overall, this game is ahead of its time. The story is well crafted and had amazing characters. The combat and Materia system is fun. I can see how this game is beloved for most players, and deserves the reputation its got.

But FFVII blew my mind. From it's characters, which I loved every single one of them (yes, even [spoiler]Cait Sith[/spoiler]), to the story slowly building up. It's plot twists, but I think what pulled me in the most, would be it's soundtrack.

I know it's story may be a bit outdated for today's storytelling standards to some people, but I really suggest you give it a try and form an opinion of your own. You won't be disappointed with this game.

Released in 1997, Final Fantasy VII was considered a triumph of the imagination, a master class of story, gameplay, music, and especially graphics. Absorb yourself into a journey revolving around the fate of the world, evil corporations, and characters that are still beloved twenty four years later. For many, Final Fantasy VII is the greatest game ever made, but does it still hold up today? 

Ye, I think its pretty good.

You play as Cloud, a funny little square man with pointy hair. Cloud is a mercenary and Former SOLDIER. That’s SOLDIER with capital letters, not Soldier as in the job, an elite military organization formed by the Shinra corporation, who are basically BP Oil but less evil. 
After doing a favor for his old friend Tifa and helping literal Eco-Terrorists blow stuff up, Cloud is thrust into a world of intrigue, conspiracy, and a hot guy with a big sword as he and his party of lovable hooligans try to save the world, and kill a lot of people while doing so.
I mean, a lot of people. 

FFVII is a Turn Based Role Playing Game where you control three party members at a time, stand in a line, and murder the other guys until they explode into experience and money. Turn based is kind of controversial in this day and age, but I kind of feel like its timeless, if you like it you like it, you know? 

What really fondles my groin is the materia system, FFVII doesn’t really have a class system, instead allowing you to junction little magic orbs called materia into your weapons and armor. Materia is basically just magic, you got fire, ice, murder, San Andreas Fault line, lightning, the god of all dragons, Actual Satan, and the power to call down rocks from space to smoosh your enemies.
You know, the usual. 

The Materia system is really cool, since you can also combine them to add stuff like status effects to your attacks. Or you can do what I do and put Cover and Counter Attack on Cid and let him beat cheeks from part 2 onward. Experimenting with Materia can be fun, but when you find something you like, you usually stick with it. 
When you start wasting bosses in one move, you’ll know what I mean. 

After the first six hours, the world opens up and you really embark on your adventure. FFVII does that thing that older games did where you had an overworld, where everything was big and you were scaled up to be walking across the world, visiting towns and other locations on the way. Its something I’m actually nostalgic over. Like the smell of burning wood or house arrest. 
It always made the world feel bigger and grander than it actually was, giving this feeling that you’re really on a journey, doing a lot more for that feeling than some of the newer Final Fantasy games have. 

The game isn’t perfect, but I’m not going to make a 30 minute long video explaining why its “FLAWED” 
Some enemies take so long to make their moves that they may as well be mailing the attack to you via envelope. Some of the encounter rates can blow me, and the late game grind can be, well it can be something if you’re going for the secret bosses.

Not me though, I tried and they put me right back into the ground like I was an overeager potato or something. 

But you can beat the game at around level 50, its kind of an uphill battle but its doable. I finished the game at level 80 because I saw Advent Children and want that Twink to stay dead this time.

It didn’t work.

There’s also cool side content like the battle arena, Chocobo Racing, Chocobo breeding which is vital to get the best summon in the game. You can be pretty busy with Final Fantasy VII if you like it enough.

My biggest problem is with this port of the game, the PC version of FFVII seems to be built off the janky PC port from the 90s that was handled by, like, 20 people. I looked it up, it was actually 20 people, and then it was published in the west by Eidos Interactive because they made Tomb Raider at the time or something. 
The game works, but you’re gonna have a bad time with the controls.

What I did is I went to the controller configuration on Steam and found a community uploaded configuration that uses the Xbox 360 controller template on your Keyboard to emulate controller support. There are other ways to do it like Xpadder and flat out modding the game, this made the game perfectly playable for me, so hurray.
Shoutout to AceKobayashi for uploading their controller configuration for everyone to use, you get a banana sticker for being a big smarty. 

I still like Final Fantasy VII a lot, but you need to understand that everything on the NES to current gen are perfectly playable to me, and even then I still enjoy Pong and Space Invaders. If you’re a stickler for modern conveniences or graphics, then FFVII may not be for you. You can go, I dunno, watch paint dry or something. But to be Final Fantasy VII is something special, and its something I won’t forget until Alzheimer's and dementia rends my brain from this mortal coil.

Final Fantasy VII gets 9 Buster Sword spins out of 10. 

The FSB uses a Linux distribution called Astra Linux that was specifically made with them in mind, while the CIA uses Windows 7 with security patches not available to the public.

But having now played it, I understand. The Story, the characters, the world-building! Nearly every part of the game held up amazingly and kept me interested and wanting to see what happens next. This is a must play for any RPG fan!

Pros:
+The Story – I somehow made it this far in life without getting this game spoiled for me, minus the death of a certain popular character, and my experience was better for it. The twists and details of character’s backstories and motives kept surprising me over and over!

+The Characters – I can see why they are so beloved. Even some of the characters I started out not liking generally won me over in the end. The party also had a really nice dynamic outside of combat. Though in combat I generally stuck to 3-4 certain characters.

+The Visuals – While some elements, such as telling where you can go on certain maps, haven’t aged the best, overall the visuals are still a joy to look at and seeing how they worked with their limitations was great.

+Midgard – The over-hyped part of the over-hyped game, but once again I see why. It is an excellent opening to not only the world, but the characters and their motive. My only complaint was that some of the parts following Midgard did not live up to it and felt like the story slowed down. But it quickly caught back up!

Neutral:
+/-World Navigation – I loved the world itself, but navigating it, mainly in the first half of the game, felt like a chore.

+/-The Gold Saucer – Coming from Final Fantasy XIV, I was generally surprised to find the Gold Saucer in this game, but it was a bit of a let down and I didn’t find myself returning to it at all outside of the story.

+/-The Localization – This is probably beating a long dead horse, but the English Localization isn’t the best. Outside of some grammar issues here and there, my main problem was the weird writing choices that pulled me out of the game, like Cid mentioning the Greek Language.

Cons:
-The Final Dungeon – The final boss was great, but the dungeon leading up to it was awful. Fun Fact about my play through: I didn’t know you could flee from battles until right before the final battle, so I had to fight through a horde of battles with Tonberry’s and other extremely high HP monsters that drained nearly all of my resources before I even got to the ending. While this was mainly my fault, in my defense I don’t remember seeing it explained and it’s not in the command menu. I only figured it out by looking it up. (I had to hold Page Up & Page Down at the same time. I played on controller but the PC version didn’t give me controls for a controller.) The final boss was still quite fun though.",1630554178,1630554178,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a mechanical rework of the game focused on making the gameplay more engaging through deeper mechanics, adjusted values on stuff, an expanded materia system, and increased difficulty. It is not intended to be a ""difficulty hack"", more of a ""midcore"" difficulty that encourages a little more mindful play in general.

and WEEEEEEEEEEEEW LAD IT'S INCREDIBLE. Can't recommend it enough. The dude did God's work on this game.

FF7 has always been one of my favorite games story-wise, but the battles are so mindless that it's hard for me to actually sit down and play these days. New Threat mod fixes this pretty much entirely. It isn't so hard that I need to pull out all the stops, but most bosses take 2-3 tries with some strategy adjustment, I have a party with defined roles based on a new stat growth system, and I spend way too long before every major fight adjusting my materia builds. I love it.

I have nothing really more to say other than if you like FF7 (or just ATB turn based games in general) but you're on the fence since you find the gameplay tedious, try this. If you happen to see this review and you've already played FF7, try this anyways. It's like a whole new game.

Speaking of ""whole new game"", there are two modes available in the New Threat Mod, ""type A"" and ""type B"". ""type A"" is the original game with the mechanical changes I've mentioned. There are also a few minor story changes, like you get Yuffie and Vincent for free. But ""type B"" is essentially the mod author's OC FF7 game, it is like an actually new game with entirely new story beats and such. I'll be trying that next.

Meanwhile, you're racing against them to find a former coworker who's trying to use his famous mom's power for political gain.

I've played for thousands of hours, but it doesn't show on Steam because this is the third time I've bought it. That's how much I enjoy this game. It's the only game that I've ever bought 3 times without first losing the previous copies. To be clear, the Steam edition is only marginally better than the original Windows release, except for an increase in resolution for the 3D elements, but that's not very helpful because the low-poly 3D and low-res textures they used in 1997 haven't aged well, even when rendered at much higher display resolution. A key issue with the old graphics is many of the characters have cubes for forearms with proportions worse than Popeye. At such a reduced price, I decided to get this anyway when I bought the rest of the FF franchise just for the convenience of having everything on Steam. More of the old games have been released for Steam since then, so I now have more to buy.

I recommend using the 7th Heaven mod manager to update the graphics, The mod manager also adds support for typing names with the keyboard, which was available in the original Windows release but missing from the Steam edition. The downside is that the mods don't update most of the enemies and NPCs, so some things stand out beside your modded character.

Fun fact: My favorite ad for this game says, ""more than 200 animators and programmers, a multi-million dollar production, over 2 years in the making, and a cast of thousands! They said it couldn't be done in a major motion picture,"" then finishes by gloating, ""they were right,"" and revealing that they were describing a video game. The ad is retroactively wrong, because ""the Simpsons Movie"" was released 10 years later, matching the ad's description of FF7, except it's unclear how many characters there are because I can't find a complete list but there are at least several hundred.",1629904003,1629904003,True,3,8,0.528161883354187012,0,True,False,False

I truly understand why FFVII is so beloved, it has a phenomenal story, the gameplay can become very involved and challenging compared to prior (and later) entries in the franchise, and the art style can still be charming regardless of its age and errors.

However I think this game shows some serious cracks with all the ""stuff"" they shoved into the game in the form of crappy minigames like marching in a military parade, snowboarding etc etc; the list goes on. these all feel like shitty versions of better games that existed at the time and end up just annoying me as all I want to do is get back to the combat and story. 
I also think that they made a serious error in going with the chibi style for the field models, I KNOW that this is a product of them not knowing 3d games yet but they figured it out for combat models so they should have just delayed it a year and reworked the game. 

OH and my largest complaint with the game is how much shit is missable, I used a guide only on parts where I was completely stuck and/or lost so as a consequence I missed alot of side content and quests, namely[spoiler] Vincent and Yuffie.[/spoiler]

So do I recommend FFVII? yeah absolutely, I also recommend using a walkthrough so you can find the 2 missable party member and all the side quests you want to do. 

And side note I used The Reunion mod which retranslates the game so the story makes more sense. (I recommend using it as well)

start the game using Steam - after ensuring you have activated the controller on the game through steam - when you start it, you will see a message that says the controller is overriding - start the game or continue from a save.  now the  game knows you should have a controller so quite out, and then when at the starts screen, controller is now not grayed out.  go to controller, you can see that, hit OK, and then start the game again - this time your controller will work :)  hope that helps someone.

This port is a sham. It used to be worse. Now it is only atrocious. Prompts on the screen refer to internal variables within the program. So when you suddenly find yourself needing to swing to one side of a pit you're falling down, a prompt will tell you to spam [CANCEL] or [PG UP] to accomplish the task. You'll of course fumble to figure out what the hell that is, and mess up the minigame event.

There is no toolset to assist in any way with what is essentially 240p (slightly worse) JPEG still backgrounds blown up to 1080p or greater. The game looks like a Lite Brite. (thats a toy from back before everyone had internet)

The models in the game however do not share any kind of matching resolution to these background or FMV moments that they are placed in. Because of this, they literally look like stickers shoved onto the painfully blown up backgrounds. At all times, the characters look like they're walking on top of a canvas.

There is audible popping in the soundtrack and special effects if you're wearing even a modestly solid pair of cans while playing

Mouths are broken, and are passively turned on in scenes that completely ruin the tone. Imagine someone with blowjob mouth as they fall to their knees in sorrow. Now don't laugh, and try to convince yourself that moment wasn't ruined.

Sadly, the name of the game for this classic is still either emulation or its vastly superior console ports on the Switch or Playstation 4. There are still background issues in those ports, but they are lessened, the prompts are correct, the mouths are correct, the audio is correct and so on and so forth.

Okay. As for the game. Its not cool to love this game, so if your emo lock is firmly gelled into place I'd suggest you move along and find something thats not 'mainstream' to love. Having said all that, this game works on every level. As a classic of JRPG storytelling, as a high water mark of JRPG combat, as an exploration game, as an easter egg hunt, as a source of some of the greatest game music ever composed, and even in 2021, a source of spectacle.

Yeah. Its old. Really old. But Final Fantasy 7 was a look into the future of the AAA game in all its glory (and horror). It promised a AAA, blockbuster, cinematic experience and it delivered even by today's standards. By 1997 standards it literally reorganized the games industry overnight. So if you dig game history at all, this is a mandatory chapter.It is far from flawless, and theres some underbaked spots on this gargantuan game, but it deserves being brought up in the same conversation with Zelda, Mario, and the like.

But this port makes my eyes bleed. You have to mod it halfway to China to make it viable. Please tread lightly... and maybe buy a console version.",1587669178,1626193612,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I knew a little bit about it, but I didn't have any nostalgia for it, or any Final Fantasy game for that matter. Now that I'm older, I played it because I wanted to understand what made this game so popular among gamers of the previous generation. Going into it, I wasn't sure how well it would hold up, but I can safely say that it does hold up and its longtime praise is earned. This game quickly became one of my favorite JRPGs, possibly one of my favorite games in general. I even grew to like some of the characters so much they're my favorite characters of all time.

It didn't take long for me to get engaged in the story despite knowing about a lot of major plot points; I was enjoying every part of the ride this game takes you on. While controls were sometimes clunky, I immediately fell in love with the battle system as well - experimenting with Materia combinations is the most fun I've had spent in game menus. The story sometimes left me confused and the writing in the original translation doesn't always land, but I personally found this very easy to overlook as I enjoyed all my time spent with the characters anyway.

Visuals and music are subjective; unfortunately I feel that the graphical limitations of the time couldn't fully realize the artists' vision - but the blocky characters do have their own charm in my opinion. The music on the other hand is wonderful, and immediately became one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time. I found the many themes to be instantly memorable and filled with such emotion, it feels as if I've known the soundtrack all my life.

Many may say that this game is overrated, and while it isn't by any means a perfect game, I truly believe it has earned its reputation. This is the kind of game one would treasure as part of their childhood, but it can be still be enjoyed by a newcomer to the series such as myself. For me, there is something truly special about this world and its characters that immediately drew me in and found a place in my heart.

I can see why people thought this was amazing back when it came out but still claiming that it’s one of the best rpg’s ever made I just disagree with. I think it’s mostly just nostalgia talking, this was my first time playing this game, I have played and beat Final Fantasy 4 and 6 before this and I do think that this game is slightly better than those, I thought those were very average as well. I find it very difficult to get invested and care about sprites on a screen or in this games case very low quality looking characters that can’t emote especially after playing recent rpg’s like The Witcher or Dragon Age. The poor writing/translation doesn’t help either. But there has been games like Chrono Trigger where I did like the characters and the story so I don’t know, maybe I just didn’t find the characters compelling in these games. I didn’t care in the slightest when a character died. In this game in particular I was so bored at the amount of time they spend on these drawn out backstories of Cloud, Tifa, Barret etc. These games do tell decent stories but I wouldn’t call them good, the journey these characters go on always devolves into having to stop the big mean bad guy which is ok because there is so many different ways you can tell that same story it’s just nothing too riveting. 

I also don’t like the pacing because of the amount of diversions the characters get thrown in, it feels like it’s done just to extend the length of the game it doesn’t feel like it has a purpose. I do like how each game tries to change up the world it’s set in though it keeps the games from feeling too similar to each other and I did like the setting in this game. The music was also pretty good the final boss theme in particular sticks out and it’s just epic. Moving on to the gameplay I’m not a fan of turn based combat, I think it’s very slow paced, boring and a chore especially when you have to grind to level up. I do like the turn based combat in FF7 more than I did in the 2d games but it still felt like a chore, I had to put music or videos in the background to keep myself playing during dungeons or when I was grinding. There are some sections in the game that were just very boring to get through like the gold saucer for example where you have to run around for quite a bit to find and where you have to go and what you have to do to progress. The mini games are so clunky and awful I wish they just didn’t bother. 

I don’t think this game is still worth playing today, if you are curious about it then I would say give it a try but if you are looking for a genuinely good RPG to play then no because by today’s standards I don’t think this game is good. I can’t see myself recommending this game to any of my friends, I have a few that tried it and couldn’t get into it and I checked my steam friends who own the game to see how many hours they put into it and the most I’ve seen is 3 hours. I think there are multiple rpg’s released every year that are more fun and better than Final Fantasy 7. I hope the later games in the franchise that I plan on playing get me invested.

Personally I love the game's plot, music, and characters, but everything else is really not that great. 
The graphics haven't stood the test of time as well as some of its contemporaries, and this is especially noticeable with the maps, which are just extremely crusty JPGs that can be very confusing to navigate.

Materia is interesting conceptually but with how often you need to rearrange it (because the game sometimes straight-up takes away your established equipment when there are major changes in the party) and how much grinding it requires, it's a massive pain in the ass compared to other games' learning systems (FFX, for one, I believe does a great job at making it unique without it being too complicated).

But the game's biggest problem comes in the form of the constant minigames that frequently serve no purpose and feel like just tacky, barely-finished tech demos for other games that Square just wanted to shoehorn in to flex on cartridge consoles. Not a single one of these minigames feels fun or relevant to the plot, and you can't even replay them later for the most part (not that anyone would want to do that).

FF7 managed to hit the spot perfectly;  Having never had a playstation growing up I had never experienced it myself but lord knows I watched enough friends trying desperately to get their materia back in Wutai or whatever.  

With my odd circumstances out of the way, I can confirm that despite many J-RPGs seeming impenetrable to me, this game struck the right amount of accessible and fiddly (though I made exhaustive use of a strategy guide and thank god I did because it turns out the game would be much harder without finding the useful Enemy Skills).  And I am aware that for those interested there are whole seams of gameplay I haven't explored.  I don't even have a Chocobo in a stables anywhere.

The story (apart from Cid's presentation and the cross dressing) really holds up and, having just finished it, has left me moved and aching in the way only the best stories can. The themes resonated with me deeply and Cloud and Barret's struggles in particular struck a chord.  There are many lines that stuck with me, especially around keeping going when things look impossible.  Presentation wise too, I will admit it took me a while to look past the 'playmobil' character models, but in those key scenes the cgi is still great and the framing and direction are always top notch.  The cinematography in that opening shot is a stellar example of both.

FF7 is my first introduction to the Final Fantasy series and to be honest, I'm super excited to try out the other games now. For a game from the late 90's, I think it still makes for a great experience.

The graphics put me off at first (coming from a guy who's into boomer shooters) but I was able to get used to it in about 5 hours. I liked its turn-based combat system, and it felt it had a good amount of depth if you take the time to understand its mechanics (don't let others deter you from turn-based combat just because they don't like it themselves!).

[b]Final Fantasy VII[/b] was my first introduction to the [i]Final Fantasy[/i] series. Played the game recently and absolutely loved it, so this review has no [i]Nostalgia Goggles[/i] on. So...let's start.

[h1]""The Planet Waves a Cruel Fate to Men...""[/h1]

[b]Final Fantasy VII[/b] follows the story of [i]EX-Soldier[/i] [b]Cloud Strife[/b], who is hired by the eco-terrorist group [i]AVALANCHE[/i], Led by [i]Barret Wallace[/i] to help fight the mega corporation [i]Shinra Company[/i], who attempts to drain [i]The Planet's Lifeforce[/i] as an energy source to further their profits. Apathetic to the cause, [I]Cloud[/i] initialy fights for personal gain, and for the promise he made to childhood friend [i]Tifa Lockhart[/i]. [i]Cloud[/i] eventually join forces with many others to save the planet , wich is threatened by [i]Shinra[/i] and Cloud's nemesis [i]Sephiroth[/i], and discovers a reason to fight for a cause other than his own.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]Final Fantasy VII[/b] uses the [i]Active Time Battle[/i] system, which means that you have to wait the [i]Time Bar[/i] to fill so you can attack the enemies, this goes to all three party members. The enemies also have this [i]Time Bar[/i] (But it doesn't show), wich means, even if you don't attack, the enemies will still make their moves. If you use [i]Limit Breaks[/i] or [i]Summons[/i] this [i]Time Bar[/i] will be stopped until the action ends. [i]Limit Breaks[/i] are skillsets unique to each party member. Each character has a [i]Limit Bar[/i], which fills as the character angers as they are attacked by enemies.

We have a total of nine playable characters:
[list]
[*] [b]Cloud Strife[/b]

[*] [b]Barret Wallace[/b]

[*] [b]Tifa Lockhart[/b]

[*] [b]Aerith Gainsborough[/b]

[*] [b]Red XIII[/b]

[*] [b]Yuffie Kisaragi[/b] (Optional)

[*] [b]Cait Sith[/b]

[*] [b]Vincent Valentine[/b] (Optional)

[*] [b]Cid Highwind[/b]
[/list]

[h1]Materia System[/h1]
[b]Materias[/b] are made from [i]Mako Energy[/i], allow a character to cast [i]Spells[/i], [i]Summons[/i], [i]Boosts Stats[/i] and give [i]Support Abilities[/i].

There are five types of [b]Materia[/b]:
[list]
[*] [b]Summon Materia:[/b] ([i]Red[/i]) - Summons creatures to cause devastating effects to foes or positive effects to the user.

[*] [b]Magic Materia:[/b] ([i]Green[/i]) - Used to cast magic spells which can deal damage, heal or various effects. 

[*] [b]Command Materia:[/b] ([i]Yellow[/i]) - Adds abilities beyond summons and magic to the user, to various effects.

[*] [b]Support Materia:[/b] ([i]Blue[/i]) - Enhances the power of other materia when paired with them.

[*] [b]Independent Materia:[/b] ([i]Purple[/i]) - Provides support, auto-abilities and stat boosts to the user.
[/list]
[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
The [i]Final Fantasy Series[/i] is well known for having one of the best soundtracks in videogame history, [b]Final Fantasy VII[/b] is no different, composed by the Legendary [i]Nobuo Uematsu[/i], all songs emerge perfectly with the game theme, with epic Boss battle tracks and even normal battles tracks. It's simply perfect.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Always heard people talking how great was [b]Final Fantasy VII[/b], i wasn't very much into [i]JRPGs[/i], but last year, decided to buy this game and see why people loved so much. After finishing, i understanded why people loved this game so much, was such a unique experience and a great introduction to the [i]Final Fantasy Series[/i]. i totally recommend [b]Final Fantasy VII[/b].

First-time played. 

Wow! That was quite the ride. I can see why Final Fantasy VII is considered one of the great games of last millennium.  The story is nothing short of epic.  The game itself is huge with tons of (written) dialogue and heaps to explore.  

The use of animations to assist with the story telling was well done.  
And sometimes with a very effective use of the pixelated graphics,.

A clever use of travel opens up the map.  First you travel on foot, then jeep, then boat, then by air, and finally in a submarine.  This allows clever use of the map as new areas open up as the story progresses, without any fake walls or the use of ""level guardians"" which keep you out of an area if you aren't strong enough.  This also serves to provide an open world experience yet still have a story that is quite linear lie behind it.  

There are also numerous side quests and other things to do in this game, which added to the sense of ""this is a BIG game!""

Although I finished in a 33.6 hours, if I wanted to I could have bred chocobos, played lots of mini-games, and further explored.  I know I missed a lot of extra material.  What stopped me is that FF7 is not without its flaws. 

For one, the combat system itself, although containing a lot of depth and quite interesting, is confusing and clunky.  I got turned into a frog one fight, and I couldn't remember how to cure myself, but there are no hints at what items do once you get into battle.  The Materia system is very cool, I could figure out ""fire"" and ""ice"" but a lack of a glossary doesn't tell you what ""ultima"" actually does.

So, what could have been an excellent system ended up being quite bland, as I pretty much just button-mashed ""x-x"" most of the time to attack the nearest enemy, with a liberal use of ""regen"" and ""cure"" as the battles progressed.   I'm sure I didn't use more than 25% of the available attacks.  Enemy skill looked cool, but I only learned 3 by the end of the game. 

This combat system was exacerbated by two other things: 1. The high frequency of random encounters.  Geesh, in the final level I was getting so annoyed... and 2. Super long special attack animations.  Summoning monsters/gods was cool, but the animations took so long.  But the worst of the worst was Sephiroth's supernova attack...  

... the first time he cast it I thought it was pretty cool.  But it was so long (like 30-60 seconds?) that I thought it must be a special one-off shift in the battle.  In the final fight he cast it 4 times!  I was about to leave my chair and go for a walk by the fourth time...  Most animations aren't that long, but lots of them, even the enemy ones, get pretty tedious watching for the thirtieth time as you randomly encounter the same enemy for the fifteenth time...

Inventory management is also awkward, being designed for a controller. Difficult when you acquire 50, 60, 70+ different items and a similar number of materia...

Still, for a game made in 1997, I was very impressed.  It's aged a little bit, but the story is still epic enough to make it worth playing through.

What more really needs to be said? It's that game that has the legacy that no other RPG has ever attained.

If you're curious about FF7, I promise it's worth it. And the people who say it doesn't hold up anymore, may have a point, because RPGs have evolved vastly over the years, which might make this feel less special if you've played others before you give this one a try. But it does not take away from the fact that it is still an excellent game. Hell, here I am writing up a Steam review (regardless of how unneccessary it is) because I feel it did something with me. I want to know more about the World, the Characters of this game. I watch after my playtrough ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"" and feel happy to see my people back in action.. I'm looking on YouTube for some great content creators works (and there is a lot) and want to learn more about everything.. and so on and so on.

I've avoided this game time and time again because I wasn't sure if it was worth buying or not (was the story interesting or not, interesting game elements, etc etc); and I can for sure say that it was unfortunately not. I'm probably halfway through the game already and whilst the story and game mechanics we're very well put together, it is an EXTRAORDINARILY CREEPY game. This game is nightmare fuel if you play it long enough. I can allow things to a certain extent but man this game can give you the heebie jeebies if you play it long enough. Yes, great story, good game mechanics, character development and all but the main thing that the story always revolves around involves alot of elements that are probably not for anyone to watch (and in my case, hear). I wanted to like this game, but I just can't; so I'm uninstalling it.

TL;DR: Great game, epic story, good game mechanics and all, but the elements that which the story eventually revolves around takes a super extreme dark turn and whilst I can tolerate that to a certain degree, this game takes it to a whole nother' level.

Port is decent, controls with Mouse and Keyboard are a little weird at first, but there is also controller support. Probably what is the greatest reason to get it for PC too, is the mods. You can customize how it looks and plays with various mods. Some mods can be found on the Nexus, but I would suggest looking into 7th Heaven. Can probably find it really easy with a simple ""Final Fantasy 7 PC 7th Heave mod loader"" on Google. The mod loader will help you find and install a lot of good mods for the game. There is a couple Youtube videos out there too to help set up the mod loader and how to get mods from other locations and use them with the loader as well.

9.5/10 - If you're a fan of JRPGs and haven't played this one, it is worth it. If you loved it on the PSX when it first came out, then the PC could have a nice and new way to play this timeless classic with the help of mods. In both cases I highly recommend.

It's definitely not a game I dislike, but I feel like that there's much more better games in the same genre nowadays. Especially those that aren't restrained from the late 90s design choices, obligatory grinding and super easily missable stuff. I think Final Fantasy 9 has a similar plot with similar design choices that ends up much, much better than its previous counterpart. Much better for series newcomers wanting to try PS1-era JRPGs. 
-- Hence the negative review. This is probably down right the worst way to currently play Final Fantasy 7. 

I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it has much, has I already played a chunk of it during childhood, giving me lots of nostalgia for it. As a kid, I only got far enough to the partt where you need to reach the city of the Ancients for the first time, a bit before the end of Disc 1. Once the nostalgia was gone and I was now at the part that I don't remember playing, it got... Kinda worse? I used to play it in English back when I barely understood English; so it kinda felt like a new-old experience for me, now that I would understand the game. 

The game is also not as good as I remembered. Lots of downtime, way too many missable stuff, characters that are either completely useless to the plot (mostly optionals like Yuffie and Vincent) and a whole character that is basically a plot device (looking at you, Cait Sith) 

Most sidequests are about grinding for little to no reasons, inconsequential minigames with awful controls, of stuff that you pretty much have to read a guide to understand. 

I know people loves to praise the story, but it's just... Fine? I mean, it's good, but the pacing is really awful, and I kinda expected more from the antagonist. Also from Rufus, the Turks and Scarlet; who kinda is just ""there"" for like half the game, and you only get the option to slap her once. I guess it must have been pretty groundbreaking for a videogame back then, especially with a certain character death; had I not been spoiled by it I would have been so shocked, along some few scenes where I would have been scared of losing other party members. 

Also I have a few complaints about the other characters: he's pretty much useless to the plot once you leave Midgar. His next story bit Is in Gold Saucer, and that's it. He also seems to realize how his action also impacted lots of innocent people near the end? Damn, must be nice being this dense. 
Red 13 is also pretty much useless, except for one single scene in Cosmo Canyon. He's just... There, for the rest of the game. He could have easily been written off. 
I wished they had been more prominent in the plot and not just party member that you forget about, which I thought would be Did; who ended up having much more story beats than the others who joined way earlier. 

I liked the Battle system, but it felt pretty barren before levelling materias, it definitely was hard to start with so little. Made the beginning way more harder to enjoy. Way too many animations are also too long for what they are, making me avoiding most of them despite their huge damage potential. I saw Knights of the Rounds once, and that was enough, I don't want to waste 2 minutes watching it again. It got boring after a while due to the long ass animations. Kinda sad since near the end the possibilities with the materias gets so much more complex and interesting; which should have been much better explained. 

Talking about how slow animations are, l also find most of the moving options to be super slow too. Either due to the general speed or the map that is too big.  So many maps where it feels like I have to walk for an eternity, spend a few minutes just to get to the top of the ladder, or climb stairs for 5 minutes, or use the different transportation options in the overworldthat are still super slow. And even the first one comes in with random encounters, which I don't get because chocobos don't? 
My favorite is definitely the submarine where each movement felt like an eternity; I was so glad to learn there's so little to do with. I even made sure to skip one part by using chocobos instead. 

The music is definitely the best part of the game, along with the first part of the plot. Once the first part is done, the plot just try too hard to unravel everything in a pace too slow. Also, Weapons, they have little to no explanations to them, which is a shame. I don't get why they didn't wake up much, much more earlier with the Shinra projects. 

The ending is a huge joke, too. But that's not something I'm going to address here. It got kind of retconned with the tons of sequels the game's got.",1621176103,1621176445,False,1,0,0.407608211040496826,0,True,False,False

There are difficult side goals for those who are completionist and like a challenge. The graphics may be old, but when you realize they are from 1997 there really isnt much to complain about.

The reason why I have 10 minutes or so on record only is because I used the 7th Heaven launcher for the Remako visual mod and a couple others which disabled achievements and did not record my play time for whatever reason.

After having played FFVI and feeling quite a bit underwhelmed after having heard so much about it and its comparisons with its younger brother FFVII and the legendary Chrono Trigger, I was expecting great things. And considering this was Square's first go at a 3D RPG my expectations were not only met, but far exceeded by the quality of the game. 

And I have got to admit from the start, I was going into FFVII 100% biased and knowing I was biased before I even hit that NEW GAME button. I was expecting something not as great as Chrono Trigger, and something not even as good as FFVI. Let me explain: with a lot of older games and media people have an obscured view of the past and so I always go into older games thinking that people only remember the good parts. But this is also coupled with the fact that a lot of the stuff from the 90s is just overhyped, overrated, or just doesn't hold up. I'll give a few examples: Gundam Wing, Dragon Ball Z, Quake, Doom, FFVI, and others. What do all of these things have in common for the most part: they are explosive and essentially mindless. The story is bad, the actions of the characters don't make sense, or there is really nothing much of real substance. And FFVII was giving me the same vibes before playing. 

So, I went into FFVII thinking that it would be mindless and full of explosives that get the adrenaline going but nothing else. I was dead wrong, FFVII actually holds up really well and I am embarrassed I even felt like it was going to be nothing but one of the greatest games I have ever played. 

However, before I get into the good stuff, here's the bad: the most spoiled thing quite possibly in video game history (why can't FFVII fans shut up about major events in this game? I guess it's because the fanbase is too big?), the world itself is kinda boring and it just seems like it's there for the characters to have this specific story play out, you need to turn the battle speed to max right away unless you love waiting around, the materia system (magic) is not that great at the start, you can't hold 2 accessories like FFVI, it takes a bit too long to get the Highwind (the airship you use in the game), the Chocobo breeding necessary to get to areas for hidden materia is tedious, the mini-games do not hold up at all, after leaving Midgar and until leaving that first cave the enemies give very little XP, Vincent is kind of a weird character to throw into the mix although he is highly miss-able if you are not thorough, the pacing after the first time at northern crater is a bit worse, the final dungeon might be worse than all of the dungeons in the game as it's a bit random, the inability to reach certain bosses during fights just drags them on and isn't interesting, the dread I felt while chasing the final boss did not seem warranted after having beat them fairly easily at the end despite only being level 71, reading deeper into the story kinda worsens it although you won't really worsen it for yourself if you don't seek it out, the inventory is a mess, the pathing in caves is definitely not perfect, and there are really random mechanics thrown at you that kinda takes you out of what's happening like when you have to actually press buttons for a gauge to do mouth to mouth on someone you just saved from a boss. Oh, almost forgot, this game might have my least favourite enemy in a JRPG to date: the stupid grasshopper enemies in Mount Nibel because they take forever to finish attacking. 

But here's the good stuff: basically all of the dungeons (and puzzles), the music is fantastic, the bosses and enemies are far more interesting than FFVI, there is explosive action like I was expecting, the video sequences are epic, there was far far far less grinding necessary to be able to finish the game unlike FFVI, the pacing was mostly excellent throughout the entire game, the characters have great interactions, Yuffie's side quest is great, each chunk of the game felt a bit different and cool in its own way, there are a lot of touching moments I was honestly not expecting due to Cloud's perceived edgeiness before playing the game, Cloud's edginess is actually exaggerated, the materia system becomes really great in the mid to late game because it enables more strategy and interesting combinations for the player, the chase of Sephiroth is really cool, the story takes a lot from Neon Genesis Evangelion and uses its own twists and characters to make it cooler imo, the inventory management is heavily reduced, and FFVII has the best start to a game in video game history. 

Honestly, if Square had just improved upon what I disliked about the game and brought the visuals to the modern age for their remake I think it would be my favourite game of all time and that's crazy because I really enjoyed Chrono Trigger, and Dragon Age Origins is currently my favourite game of all time. 

However, due to all of the negatives, I would have to say it is a worse game than Chrono Trigger, but a better game than Persona 4 and FFVI. That is not to say that you could not select FFVII as your favourite game ever over Chrono Trigger, I just think there are less negatives about Chrono Trigger in general and the bosses and dungeons are actually even more fun in Chrono Trigger. 

Grading this game I would give it a low to mid 80. 

But why am I not recommending this masterpiece? This port is like a waiter spitting in your face before they serve you one of the best meals you've had in your life and I don't even have any nostalgia towards the game. The people who recommend this port to others really need to raise their standards because it is bare bones and the only good thing I can say about it is that it's stable.",1620922225,1620922225,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT: 5-12-2021   SPOILERS

Playing this game for the first time on the Nintendo Switch felt like a real journey that was memorable and the characters are the best i've seen in a long time and the music, the goddamn music is very sad, powerful, heroic, and felt like I was playing a different game. through the beginning till the very end it felt like a totally different game then what I was playing, The characters felt like they had meaning and life put into them and made sense to be part of the journey. From seeing Sephiroth for the first time i felt intimated by him in Clouds flashback and felt I was standing next to god fighting along side him. Cloud is probably the best main character in a game from being some as.s hole mercenary to becoming much more than you're standard protagonist in a game. And the final boss fight with Safer Sephiroth with one winged angel and where the cinnamatic camera makes it shine with the best climatic battle i ever faced. The ending of this game is truly amazing with the end credits making me f^%$$ing cry for the first time in a end credits and clapped as well making this game my favorite game of all time.

I have changed my review for this game because Square Enix finally fixed the game to work. I've already played this game at least a half dozen times on PS1 (originally) and other platforms that the game has been on since then. 

FINAL FANTASY VII is perhaps one of the best JRPG games ever released. ""What is a JRPG?"" you might be thinking. A JRPG typically, or at least traditionally when FF7 was released, is a party or sometimes rarely single character game that a single PLAYER would play. It would have a strong, mostly linear storyline. It would have lots of playable and non-playable characters that may or may not enter into the ""party"" to be playable. Typically these kinds of games are TURN-BASED combat, or sometimes they're action-RPG but even then they're less demanding on hand-eye coordination than a typical platformer or shooter game. So JRPG are basically turn-based, single-player games, heavy on story, with lots of interesting characters. 

Final Fantasy VII is typical of its genre, but what set it apart from many other JRPG of its day was that it created a complex and unique world where magic and technology co-existed, but that the energy used to power the technology of this world was literally being sucked out of the planet's ""spirit"" or ""Gaia"" force. This energy was called ""Mako"" and gigantic building-sized reactors called ""Mako Reactors"" are used by a large mega-corporation called ""Shinra"" to control the city and most everyone in it. It is a dystopian setting, very Cyberpunk in its feel, along with a magic-feel that was reminiscent of earlier Final Fantasy games that were strictly (or mostly at least) swords and sorcery. This gave the game an edgy, ""take down the man"" kind of a feel to it. You weren't saving the planet from some crazed sorcerer or monsters. You were saving it from normal people who have let their corporate-oriented society run away from them.

Full of memorable characters and scenes, Final Fantasy VII has a long and interesting storyline that weaves around and offers some chances for exploration and non-linear progression some of the time but overall is fairly linear. There are a few places where you might need to ""grind"" which means to ""just sit around killing monsters to level up"" until you can get powerful enough to beat a boss encounter to progress the story further. Make sure you save in several slots so that if you do encounter something like this that you can't get beyond, you can revert to an earlier save point and grind to get more powerful. 

Also this game has specific places you can save, save-points, but it DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY SAVE. So don't forget to save the game when you find the (?) shaped save points. You'll also want to be sure to stock up on healing and ether (magic) potions often when you have the chance to, and ""phoenix down"" for reviving downed party members. There are a billion guides on the web for this if you get stuck.

Have fun, I do recommend this to anyone who likes good story games even if the graphics are now kind of dated. There is of course the new FF7 Remake, but first of all it's on PS4 now only, and second of all it is only about 1/3 of the original game story, they're going to make us all pay $60 x 3 to get the full story it seems (original game was 3 separate discs on PS1). They also changed the combat for the remake and it's far more action-oriented, and not really my bag although I'll probably slog through it if I can to see the new graphics.

PREVIOUS REVIEW:
Game is straight up broken. There's a good chance if you buy this while it's on sale April 2020 that you will not get to play. Game requires registration with external Square-Enix account, then claims it is waiting for your email to be confirmed, claims to send email, but never actually ever sends any emails. Spent two weeks since April 18 trying to get this game to launch and it still refuses to get passed the stupid DRM. SQUARE-ENIX FAIL.

The controller support is just bad, remapping is not straightforward and the default controls are really stupid. The pre-rendered backgrounds look like garbage on any resolution past like 1080p, so try not to go above this. It really has not aged well. On top of that, Square's bad decisions never cease to amuse me; a game like Final Fantasy 6, which STILL looks beautiful on the SNES to this day, needed a ""makeover"" for the PC version where the sprites and UI have been turned into an ugly mess. BUT, this PS1 game that looks awful should be preserved 1:1. It just blows my mind how these choices are made.

Honestly, just skip this crap. Just like the Grandia 2 remaster, they contract these ports out to incompetent dip shits that are paid to do a worse job than some nerd sitting in his computer who creates mods for free. If Steam didn't have in-built controller support and achievements, I would definitely skip this. If you do buy this, get the 7th Heaven mod manager, the game is nearly unplayable without some basic QOL.

Just a nice little fun fact too, this game does not cloud save out of the box, you have to go into the settings and enable it. Like why the hell wouldn't I want cloud saves? I'm serious, this port is dumb as shit, so is Square Enix for forcing their idiotic launcher.

Final Fantasy VII is a timeless classic in the JRPG genre, with an innovative story and engaging game-play that has stood the test of time. The story will have you pulled in and have your full attention right off the bat, you'll fall in love with our heroes, laugh with them, cry with them, and conquer with them. Every time a wild event takes place you'll think the story can't keep getting crazier and more intense, but the game never stops until you reach the satisfying conclusion to the team's journey. Though the graphics are dated these days, this port of the game offers minor enhancements that make the game more presentable. Despite the dated graphics, that is the only part of the game that feels dated. The adventuring, combat, and world-building game-play were all revolutionary at the time of FF VII release and are still standard to this day. Final Fantasy VII is an amazing game that holds a special place in my and many people's hearts. It isn't revolutionary by today's standards but is an amazing piece of history of what was revolutionary in 1997 and is well worth playing.

    [*]Square fix your launchers, damn. I should be able to start the game without using a keyboard or setting a hotkey on my controller. This was especially a pain since I was playing on a living room rig without a keyboard.

I've heard alot of stories about this game, like it was one of the greatest game of all time, an awesome rpg etc, but I never managed to play it despite having it on my steam library since forever. I decided to give it a go, I wasn't ready.

First I'm gonna speak about gameplay, the gameplay is actually very good, sometimes it feels abit slow and repetitive but the materia system is good enough to keep you thrilled during the entire game. But for me this game is not about the gameplay, it's about the story.

Speaking about the story, It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. Even for today standards, it is really THAT good. The game is gorgeous, beautiful, poetic, you cannot play this game and not be hooked into this beautiful story. This game makes you laugh, cry, and feel. Sometimes you're in the middle of the story and the game randomly throw at you a heartbreaking scene that makes you tear up (nanaki and seto for exemple). There is a lot of plot twist in the story and you really feel like you're part of the story and you want to know more everytime. What's very good is every question you have in this game are answered and the final is beautiful as hell. The game is also very mature and the relationship beetween the characters is greatly handled.

Then you have the OST, I have no word to describe how good it is, there isn't a single ost that is forgettable , they are all so amazing and you will love each one of them, we are in 2021 and i've played a ♥♥♥♥ ton of games, but I think it's actually one of the best music i've ever heard in a videogame. (I played with a modded version with ps1 og OST, and also remako HD mod , you should definitely check it out if the old school graphics bother you).

To conclude, I'm gonna say that if you never played this game, you HAVE to. It's honestly one of the best gaming experience i've ever had in my entire life. And even in 2021 this game is one of the best i've ever played. Just go and experience the game, live the story and dive into that stunning fantasy universe, you will not regret it.",1614446645,1619220611,True,0,1,0,2,True,False,False

With and immersive story, Lovable Characters, as well as Sephiroth being, in my opinion, one of the best video game villains ever, you're in for a treat. 

Gameplay wise, its your basic JRPG with turn-based combat, in other words, Not the best (Unless you're into that kind of thing, Then its perfect) Now i hate turn based combat, i think its far too slow and random encounters can eat my ass, but this is one of the few JRPGs that i have enjoyed enough to finish. If i can play ff7 and say its one of my favourite games, i think most people will enjoy it. 

BUT, the steam version is lacking in comparison to modern ports of the game. If you have any other gaming platform, weather it be Playstation, Xbox or nintendo switch, I would recommend getting it on one of those. For example there is a 3X speed option on console ports, which fixes my only issue with the game and that is slow gameplay. Personally my  This of course is lacking on the pc port. My personal favourite is the Switch port, both for portability and it gave me the least issues. That being said.

This version of the game is probably the most realistic and true version to the original PS1 game and that is both a blessing and a curse.

The PS4 port of Final Fantasy VII (not the remake) is probably my favorite version of this title because of said modifiers.

I did too, but I had never played a Final Fantasy game before. As my first foray into the series, I was a bit hesitant and also extremely intimidated. I didn't know what to expect; or if I'd have the willpower, dedication, and perseverance to make it through *the* JRPG. After two attempts at playing through the game (one where I dropped it very early on), and two breaks in between, I made it through the entirety of it about a week ago.... and let me tell you that Final Fantasy has now become one of my favorite video game franchises.

The lovable cast of characters you get attached to, Nobuo Uematsu's masterfully crafted musical pieces, and the gameplay is just *chef's kiss*. I will admit that this game is from 1997—and it plays like a game from 1997. But even this has a certain charm about it. The beautifully painted backdrops for each screen are great. The sense of scale, journey and exploration in this game is also phenomenal. If the chibi 3D models bother you, then I recommend Kaldarasha's ChaOS mod, which gives all player and NPC models in the game an updated yet time/PS1-appropriate new look (very similar to the in-game battle models). I also highly recommend Mike Bettencourt's FF7 walkthrough/guide on YouTube if you're having trouble; I used this one and it is super helpful and handy.

I can't comment on whether this is the best place to start in the FF series, as it is my first. However, all-in-all I highly recommend this game. Whether you're a JRPG fan, or looking to get into the genre, this is a near-perfect game if you can get over the 1997 quirks.

All of that being said, I'll leave you with this quote regarding Final Fantasy composer's previous work on FF6:

I needed to write the review now.
I just encountered the scene at the City of the Ancients.

Buy this game. The price tag does not matter, buy it.

10/10 even for a 20+ year old game.

Amazing. You don't even have to grind, you can just wing it your first time through and as long as you can come up with strategies using what you have you will do great. I see that grinding out all the good stuff is beyond optional, but definitely looks like fun for a second run.

Reviewing this at this stage holds only slightly more worth than writing a piece predicting who will win World War II. It's not even like I can say I'm coming in with a fresh set of eyes. For years this was my favourite video game of all time. Literally nothing touched it.

This then, is the quite probably wholly redundant review of Final Fantasy VII for gamers who played it back in the nineties and are wondering whether it still hold up. The short answer to that question is yes, but not by as much as you might hope.

Context is everything, so who the hell am I? I'm the guy who:

-Played Final Fantasy VII when it came out, and absolutely adored it.
-Followed the series since then, coming out with a preference of VII > X > IX > VI > XII > XV > VIII
-Routinely go back and play games from my childhood, clocking 100 hours of Baldur's Gate this year
-Loved Final Fantasy VII mainly for its emotional impact

Before we begin, we must first be clear that this is the much-maligned PC port of the game. So if you played the original on the Playstation then be ready for several changes, many of them badly advised. The fact that characters now all have their mouths open in constant ""O""s does very little for the experience, and a few of the jokes from the original have been edited out for some reason. For the most part it's the same game.

The first thing that is immediately striking about the game is how insanely easy it is. It isn't just the fact that I died only twice in the whole playthrough (Lost Number and Tonberry King, if you're wondering), it's the fact that only at those two points did I feel imperiled. Obviously this is a game that I have known very well, but I wouldn't say I was being particularly strategically diligent. I think, if you've played other RPGs since, you may find this to be surprising in its level of challenge.

Graphically - the PC port not withstanding - it generally sits comfortably in its 1997 niche. The environments are expressive, and it continues to have the locale colour that many other entries in the series lack. However it must be said that both the FMV's and summons have suffered. These were AAA things back on release and such things rarely age well. The summons particularly are awkwardly ignored because most of the time simple melee attacks are sufficient and the time for the animation - so cool back in 1997 - now is an irritation. I used a very, very small selection.

The soundtrack, for me, has transitioned from ""incredible"" to ""often incredible."" Having played a few more recent offerings by Square Enix, the compositional quality and thematic expression remains absolutely top notch for most of the game. However not every piece makes the leap. ""Sending a Dream into the Universe"" sitting rather awkwardly next to pieces like ""Holding My Thoughts In My Heart,"" ""Aeris' Theme"" or the quite simply tremendous ""Hurry!""

Materia somehow remains fun despite the lack of challenge and I was not far off gaining master magic materia when I managed to get hold of myself and not grind the game out for the fifth time in my life!

So. That's all that dealt with. Now, the story.

Stories seldom get better with the telling, and Final Fantasy VII has been told, retold and retconned into oblivion. Does it still hold up to the adult eye? In many places yes, but in other places no.

I've always rated the simplicity of how Final Fantasy VII tells its story. You have obvious antagonists and although there is the potential for exploration in general you always have a straightforward idea of where and how you should be proceeding. In turn each step that you take brings with it and exploration of how the characters got where they are today. The story itself is told through well established (although often underrated) cinematic devices, from the low angle shot of the reactor at the start to display the dominance and reach of the ShinRa corporation, to the morality questions that Cloud and Barrett strive to ignore.

There are problems, though.

Sometimes the writing that I and so many others beloved is, objectively, a bit ham-fisted. I think back in the day we filled in the blanks or else were just much more forgiving, but there are bits and pieces that could easily have been lifted out of FFVX. I remembered the clever and nuanced bits of FFVII in my heart, but the reality is that there is an awful lot of ""this happened because reasons, but look at how cool the outcome is.""

My friend, 12 years my junior, has been playing FFVII for the very first time and they asked the question ""why are there so many party members?"" As my playthrough progressed I thought, although possibly for differing reasons, that they had a very good point. From my very first playthrough Yuffie and Vincent were core party members to me, and I could never understand why they didn't make the cutscenes. This time I've viewed it with a more critical eye and Yuffie's dialogue is largely an afterthought, and the Wutai quest is immensely irritating for very little payoff. Vincent, meanwhile, remains a disaster whose character is a blight on the narrative. Yet the character that I had the most gripe with this time was Cid. I remember liking Cid as a teenager and associating him with the good guys, but as an adult I find him to be a total prick at best.

For all this, though, the core party are as strong as ever. Cloud, Tifa, Aeris and Barrett are the people around whom the story revolves and their stories remain poignant. I'm a bit of a sap but Tifa and Aeris both managed to draw a tear to my eye. So don't fear, FFVII still has that. It's just a shame that at times they are fighting for screentime with the likes of Cid or Yuffie. Still, the positives remain.

Beyond the breakdown, what was the feel of replaying Final Fantasy VII? Well, first joy gave way to irritation at the PC ports' differences, but joy quickly resumed. It was a bit frustrating that the game posed less of a challenge than I remembered, but I still rattled through ""disk 1."" As I got to ""disk 2,"" however, my interest waned. At times I did push myself through rather than being pulled along by the story. All was forgiven for the point of Tifa in the lifestream section. I was then more than ready to grind up to beat the weapons before realising that's not a terrible productive use of my time and I pulled myself away. I did get KotR though, which tells you something about the hours put in.

So does it hold up? Yes. Just. However if like me you've been harping on about this game for the last twenty three years telling people that it's better than modern jRPGS....well. Caution is probably advised. Final Fantasy VII stands as a monument to storytelling in video games (and subsequently to hideous retcons and flogging of dead horses, but that's another story), but it's important to realise that it is a game of its time.

Of course it's still much better than the drivel Squeenix puts out these days. Rest assured.",1608499322,1616774533,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

There are a lot of games that don't quite hold up to our rose colored memories, but this ain't one of em. I still love this game, Sure, the graphics cannot compare to the triple A titles of today, and the dialogue translations can sometimes leave you scratching your head, but when evaluating the game as a whole, it can stand up to many of today's big budget games.

Most of today's young players will need to get used to the combat system, but it will only take a couple of rounds of fighting to get the hang of it. The materia system is where you'll really need to put some thought into. Combinations, enemy damage, hero boosts...all make for a very in-depth game that really can't be beat; even by today's standards.

I cannot recommend this game enough. I do recommend playing this before playing the remake (I have not played that yet btw). It will give you some insight on why this game is one of the most talked about games in history.

There are a few issues that can be really annoying, however. First and foremost are the mouths that have been put on every single NPC in the game. Half of them look perpetually surprised with an ""o"" for a mouth. some of them even have extended faces because it must have been difficult to render them otherwise making the models look extremely ridiculous. The other thing I've experienced that is really irritating is sounds hanging on, particularly in the Gold Saucer when Chocobo racing. If racing on the long track, once you pass through the waterfall, the waterfall sound continues until the race is completely over. Same with the short track except it's the space sound. The space sound is a little more tolerable, but these are some basic issues that should have been caught in testing. Movement is a little wonky, but nothing that can't be worked with.

The gameplay was fun although I only found out you could run from battles until the area before the final boss which would have been good to know much earlier since constantly getting into random battles that often would take awhile got kind of annoying. Also the last area as well as the final boss has a huge difficulty spike and for the first time in the whole game I had to do some grinding. But that's all that I have to say about this games flaws. Everything else was amazing. The characters each had well thought out back stories, rich personalities, and fun interactions among each other. The story makes you care so much for the characters and everything they're going through and there's a lot of character development as they piece together the mysteries of the story. Also Cloud is way more interesting than I expected. Not just some edgy quiet guy but actually a really fun main character with silly dialogue and lots of emotion.

You've heard it all before; this game will change your life, it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, all of that stuff. And yes, it's definitely talked up a lot, but I went in to it as a sceptic too and was genuinely surprised by how well it still holds up since 1997.

The Steam version has some odd controller button prompts but nothing that a little Google search won't fix. There's also a number of mods for seasoned players to check out too.

But the game itself is incredibly strong in it's pacing and delivery of the story, as well as allowing it's mechanics to shine throughout. The materia/magic system was a joy to mess around with and can be as simple or as deep as you want to make it. The pace of the game never lets up throughout and is always throwing new and interesting situations, minigames, story beats, enemy types and so much more at you as you progress. There's always a clear direction to move in, with plenty of optional exploration on the way, and always a clear reason to be progressing forwards.
The story and the characters themselves are extremely well presented and not dumbed down at all, they respect your intelligence and I was thankful for that.

I could probably go on for a while about FF7 and I already have done.

It's, quite simply, one of my favorite JRPGs even when compared to more recent games. It's also a timeless classic and one of gaming's all-time masterpieces. That this game existed in the day an age that it came out... Even today it seems like an impossible miracle.

One of the best game I have ever played and if you haven't you should try it (if you can get past the outdated graphics). The story is amazing, the music is legendary, the gameplay is great. It is an all time classic and every gamer should have played it at least once.  
 it's also available for free all over the internet, just google it. This review is not about the game itself but the DRM that blocks you from launching it.

So I bought this because I wanted to re-experience the feels of playing FF7 with a few mods to give it a second youth. For convenience I chose to purchase it instead of getting an emulator and ROM for free off the internet as I usually do with PS1 era games. I'm not a broke student anymore so I can now afford to spend money for both my rent AND my entertainment at the same time (Fun times). 

So i spent 2 hours making sure everything was properly installed, that every mod was correctly setup and had no compatibility issues (there is no steam workshop so everything had to be done manually). Everything was properly set up and as I launched the game I got a Square Enix app loading, getting stuck at 10% and display ""Error 9000"". 
Whaaaaaaaat?
A quick google search turned out hundreds of search results! Turns out the Square Enix servers are offline so I can't play... Oh and this seems to also be a frequent issue, i found posts from 2013, 2015, 2019, 2020 and this is just from the 3 top results of google for ""error 9000 ff7""
Whaaaaaaaat? It's freaking FInal Fantasy VII not World of Warcraft. There is no reason to be connected to play. Most people didn't have internet when the game came out, it's from the mid 90s! Consoles couldn't even connect to the internet if you had it and didn't do so for the next 10 years or so. This game released on steam in 2013 and it doesn't work as well as the game that was released 16 YEARS before. This is madness.

Instant refund, I will keep my money and play the game for free, Instead of paying 12 euros to not play the game. If you choose to have a crappy DRM system you better make sure it is working AT. ALL. TIME. 

I would like to add for posterity that I have yet to see a DRM system that wasn't cracked in the week that followed its release (and I'm being generous, it's usually more like a day or two). Devs please stop shooting yourself in the foot with these online DRM thingy. They do not work and actively turn people toward piracy.

Final Fantasy VII is a legendary video game. I figured it out only in 2021. But, better late than never.
I know this one has too old graphics, but this is due to the fact that FF7 was one of first 3D games (actually, 1997). And, of course, there are a lot of too outdated and looking redundant gameplay elements at some places.
But you can forgive the game for this due to perfect characters, so good plot and one of the most fundamental gameplay elements. I mean materia combining (it took me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear for everyone in my team).

[b] What I Liked [/b]

It's FF7, what more is there to say?  I'm not as big of fan of this game as others are, but I enjoyed it enough on the console to buy it on PC.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

That I didn't end up playing it, since I already played it a ton on console.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I made the purchase due to nostalgia.  If you don't own a PS4 or PS5 and/or don't want the remake, then this version is a good one to go with.  Plus it's the complete game!

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

+Super likable characters
+Amazing Soundtrack
+Really really good story
+Graphics were good for the time
+You dont really need to grind levels that much
+World feels lively
+Chocobos exist
+Mod support
+ good turn based combat CAN U BELIEVE IT

-Random encounters are evil, but it was fine for the time i guess
-Mods disable achievements :(

It totally is.

Every piece of it is so tightly crafted and deliberate.

As for the port, I played a bit on my PS1 copy before switching over and as far as I can tell it's identical with slightly better character models.

This game is NOT overrated, but I agree that it's somewhat overhyped, in the sense that fans (like me, eg.), always use it as reference for basically any other game. So, in this review, I'm not going to review the game itself, but Steam's version.

And I can say that this version is completely faithful to the original, with graphics in higher resolution, although the scenarios and movies have been upscaled, leaving them a little blurry. Nothing that compromises the quality, though. Having said that, there are mods that further improve the graphics, which I recommend, if achievements are not important to you.

I had to make a few changes to controls. I use an XBOX Series X controller, and I had to download 2 files and change a configuration on Steam so that it would work perfectly throughout the game.

Some tips for those playing for the first time:
- It's useful to use a guide, or at least a wikia. There are many interesting missables in the game
- Enjoy the story, it is one of the best of its time and still very good today
- Start evolving Materia as soon as possible, as this will save you a lot of time in the future
- Do not worry too much about which characters to use during the game, as in terms of abilities they are quite equivalent. Stay with your favorites.",1614136988,1614136988,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I've loved this game since it's original release. Everyone should play this version, not the remake. I played the remake. *puke* It was short and disappointing. This is the best version.

Alright, what I really came to post:
I bought this PC version of the game over a decade ago, straight from Square Enix. Long live the Square Enix cloud! I was able to pick up right where I left off. Of course I'm going to start over. It's the right thing to do.

Last thing:
My PC doesn't like to run programs unless I have some kind of speakers attached. This game is no exception. I don't have speakers so I put a jack into headphone slot and viola, running fine. Just the jack is needed, not the headphones, at least that's how my PC does it. So, if your PC steam games keep crashing, give it a shot. it might help. That was the very last thing I tried.

I grew up with this game on PlayStation (the original PS1) and I was in a constant competition with a group of friends to both discover secrets, and beat the game. I may not have won the speed competition, but I was the first in my group to find Added Cut, and Alexander Materia. Granted, I didn't find Alexander until my 2nd or 3rd play through when we were mostly focusing on finding secrets. But, when I explained how to find Added Cut, it blew their minds. I had to literally drew a route I took to the Materia for them. Also yes, that is a bit of a spoiler in the sense that yes: Those are two Materia in the game, and their hard to get, so my apologies.

But, anyways, enough about my childhood stories, onto the review!

Read the dialogue if you want to, or don't. I'm not the boss of you. The story has a deep lore that seems to change a bit through the various games associated with Final Fantasy VII (such as Dirge of Cerberus (PlayStation 2 game), Crisis Core (PlayStation Portable game), etc), but that said, you only really need to play this game to get the whole story, even if you need to play it a few times to find those hidden lore gems that connect the dots in ways that connect (at least Crisis Core) to the other Final Fantasy VII related games. 

Honestly, I will say this game is kind of technical in the sense that you have a 3 party set up, and have to use a combination of equipment, items, and Materia to battle tougher, and tougher enemies. Granted, you can pretty much steamroll through the game just by using the right tactics, but 100% completing this game can take many hours to do. I have my record down to under 26 hours, and that is just using my own shortcuts, and things I've found, not looking at guides, or routes people use to progress through the game easier. I don't exploit glitches, bugs, but I will use game mechanics to make the game easier.

In closing, I feel like if you want a game that you don't mind the pre-2000's graphics, and playing as a blonde spiky haired guy who wields a big sword (Not saying that's a bad thing!) then this is your game. This game in my opinion is one of the more unique Final Fantasy games, as it dropped the class systems from the previous Final Fantasy V, and VI which are both good games! But also lacked the card games (Triple Triad & Tetra Master) from Final Fantasy VIII & Final Fantasy IX respectfully. But, it still is a standalone game that I continue to go back to every few years, and usually I put hours into the game, and beat it each time I play it again. So enjoy it if it's something you think you could get into! Most people aren't disappointed!",1614009389,1614009389,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mean, what can be said about Final Fantasy VII that hasn't already been stated by so many. Let's just say there are clear reasons for the hype and positive reception it has garnered since it's release in 1997. In a word, this game is stunning. Not in a visual sense but in the manner in which it had endured over time and remained so relevant in the hearts of those who've taken the time to explore it's seemingly boundless world. The story is enthralling (despite some admittedly obvious pacing issues), bearing a plethora of infamously memorable moments that need to be experienced rather than simply explained. It offers deep characters, dynamics and themes with several stand-out moments. However, it should be noted that the translation of the game to English is not always perfect, and therefore I highly recommend a mod which replaces the in-game text with a much more faithful fan re-translation. Additionally, the combat is surpirsingly customizable for a game this old. Allowing for self-directed character builds through the unquestionably complex materia system, the game can hold the attention of all those who greatly enjoy deep JRPG-style turn-based combat. All of which is complemented by outstanding music and stark visuals (which were of course cutting edge for the time). Thus, this is a game I cannot recommend highly enough to everyone, despite bearing some minor flaws.

Story: I haven't finish FF7 as of the time I'm writing this. I am a MOTHER / EarthBound fan (I love the games and play them again each year.) and I played FF6 (FF3 in the west) and I couldn't get into it, I prefer modern times in terms of the setting of RPGs (You can have other opinions). But, this is set in (a bit more future) modern times. There is still comedic moments, but not as much as EarthBound / MOTHER. I like the story and it is emotional in some parts (Not the saddest game). 

Gameplay: I enjoy turn-based RPGs (sue me). This style of turn-based gameplay is enjoyable. I truly liked the gameplay. THERE ARE SOME GLITCHES AND THEY AREN'T GAME BREAKING (EXCEPT ONE IN LATER GAME (NORTHERN CAVE). I think you should print out the controls in case you forget.

about the DRM (Square Enix account thing): It isn't much of a turn off, I found it not that hard and you never have to do it again. It takes like two minutes. THEY DON'T PUT SPYWARE ON YOUR COMPUTER. Anyway, I wasn't bothered by this and you shouldn't ether. It is a good port, just takes some time to set up because of the account and downloading two items. This isn't that bad people.

Q&A 

Q: does SquareEnix install Spyware? A: NO!
Q: Is this just a port? A: Yes it is, nothing new besides achievements 
Q: Speed up A: I don't know in the PAL and NTSC-US regions, but in Japan you can.
Q: Is this fun? A: I found it fun, so you might find it fun too, you should look up videos on this port before you decide to buy FF7.
Q:Is the music still MIDI A: NO!
Q:How long is FF7 A: I checked and it is about 30 hours for the main story and if you are playing casually and do all the side quests, about 160 hours and 5 minutes.

Okay, in case you're new, let's just say this game represents the best and the worst of Japanese RPGs.

Greats: Long drawn story, fully developed characters, an addictive if sometimes repetitive combat system.

Not so greats: This is pre-2000 gaming so, grinding is a must! Also, no hand holding. Miss or skip a conversation and you're left pretty much on your own. Get ready to see the game over scene frequently. 

Also, this game was made for the Playstation. There was a PC port even back then (which I had, yay!) and it wasn't great. Sound is in MIDI and still is. Controls are a bit worse because back then the expectation was that you're playing off the numberic keypad. How many people have one nowadays?! You can remap keys but the game isn't too helpful when they tell certain sequence has to be achieved by.... you guess it, keys on the numeric keypad!!

Square-Enix left the Nintendo consoles behind for their main series and transferred to the larger world of CDs for the PlayStation. For many players, this was their first “true” RPG, and as such has a particularly-powerful place in their minds and hearts. This port is faithful to that original 1997 release, allowing a new generation of players to experience the game as many others did before them.

The battles still use the ATB mechanic, but get a few adjustments, one in the form of Limit Breaks. A new take on the Desperation Attack / Hidden Blitz mechanic of “Final Fantasy VI,” as your characters take damage, a “Limit” meter gradually fills. Once filled, you’ll be able to do a particularly strong attack as a get-back-in-the-battle move. In a good touch, they also take precedence over all successful battle inputs, allowing you to use them as soon as you select them. As a technique, Limit Breaks themselves can level up throughout the game, unlocking new abilities. However, they are quite exploitable, either through waiting to use them once the Limit meter fills (it only depletes after the move is used, not by other actions the character takes such as using items), or by filling the meter in the first place. Certain crafty players will be able to execute them almost willingly and make difficult boss fights markedly easier.

The other notable adjustment is the materia system, again drawing inspiration from “Final Fantasy VI’s” esper system.  Every character’s weapon and armor have slots for materia, or little crystals that you find throughout the world. These teach your characters their abilities like magic, summons, passives like HP or MP boosts, and miscellaneous battle abilities like Morph, Deathblow, and Double Cut. As materia levels up with AP, the abilities get stronger, so a fully-leveled Fire materia will teach your character Fire3 (or Firaga, if you prefer) and spawn a new materia of the same type, albeit with zero AP. Materia can also be linked together to create some intriguing combinations. Link Ultima with Quadra Magic and wreak destruction upon the battlefield, or Time with Added Cut to inflict Stop with your regular attacks! A sizable portion of the game’s fun (and it is!) comes from fiddling around with the materia system and seeing what crazy combinations you can come up with. Materia also provides stat increases to your characters, though I’ll remark that they aren’t enough to feel too significant.

As vast and fascinating as it is, there are some drawbacks to this system. For one, your characters cannot “learn” magic from materia. Once the materia is unequipped, your character cannot cast that materia’s spells. This means that your characters will likely just exchange materia with each other in dungeons to ensure you always have the same spells regardless of party formation. This also leads me to say that your party is increasingly homogenized compared to previous installments. Since every character can be given the same materia, “classes” or “jobs” are nonexistent. Certain characters may have a proclivity to use magic more than others, but not to a degree that it affects play. Aerith / Aeris is perhaps the only exception to this rule, as she’s specifically geared for magic.

Aesthetically, the game is certainly PS1-era. Character sprites look a little funny and look stiff as they walk, even in the FMVs. But utilizing the new space available for discs makes the backgrounds beautiful. Now as you navigate dungeons, you get the sense that you are in different locations within it, so your mental map is more-thorough. Seeing your characters actually run across the battle screen to attack enemies, complete with better-looking sprites, works wonderfully. Summon animations are awesome, as long as you accept that you’re going to be sitting by not doing anything for some time. Musically, the game has some standout tracks. Cosmo Canyon’s music, the boss theme, flying on the Highwind, and of course “One-Winged Angel” are personal favorites. Since the game’s was Square-Enix’s first outing on the PS1, the music does have occasional problems with contrasts. The brassy sound from Rufus’s welcoming ceremony got grating rather quickly, constantly hammering the speakers.

Before I continue, I say this as a fan of this game: it’s important to remember that “Final Fantasy VII” must be taken separately from all the extra material that has since come out; the game must stand alone if it’s to be reviewed fairly. It does not get credit for things that are not in the game itself. With that said, story and characters are handled well in certain instances. This tale of Shinra, the eco-terrorist AVALANCHE, and the Cetra unfolds in a compelling fashion, with moments that will certainly affect you. Cloud’s unreliable narrator quality was a great idea, and Aerith is memorably-written. Unfortunately, the rest of the main cast doesn’t get quite the same level of care or attention. Vincent and Yuffie as optional characters have virtually nothing (and anything they had is completely skippable), Barret’s development largely stops after Corel, Cid’s grouchy / flat-out rude old man persona gets old quickly, Red XIII’s character is more about his father than himself, and the list goes on. This does not mean these characters don’t have interesting moments after their development is over, but moments are not the same development.

And then there’s Sephiroth, the longsword-wielding, grey-haired wonder. The main game is a pursuit of him and the mystery of what he’s after. However, since you’re constantly fighting proxies rather than the man himself, it takes away from some of his mystique. It sadly reduces him to a “Sephiroth was controlling them” trope that gets too overused, like Golbez from “Final Fantasy IV.” While he has his moments of showing how powerful he is, the mythology surrounding Sephiroth is far and away more fascinating than the character himself. Truthfully, I found Jenova and Hojo far more intriguing. He’s still a cool villain, but he’s not the greatest.

While the game is long, it keeps the adventure moving. If you want digression, the Gold Saucer can provide that for you with its fun battle square or numerous other not-nearly-as-good minigames. There’s also Chocobo breeding, but good luck doing this without a guide! As for the outing overall, it’s a rather easy game as I only got a few game overs playing the main story. There are of course the superbosses which will really make your head spin, so if you want a brutal challenge at the end, the game provides.

While it may not be the paragon of perfection that others have made it out to be, the “Final Fantasy VII” experience was most-definitely worthwhile. It’s far too important to the franchise and RPGs in general to not be given an honest chance, and the good things in the game shine.

That being said, I'll start by saying FF7 on anything is great, however.. the steam version did irritate me a little bit because of the poor control system when using a controller, very odd button combinations which is documented in the forums which for me does let the experience down especially when it comes to mini games, however.... you can get good fixes on the community forums with steam so this is why I would recommend it.  If you don't want to do the changes then it could be a bit frustrating for you but if you do want to spend a bit of time mapping the controls quickly then it is just as good as some of the other ports.

Dernière partie : Février 2021
Lorsqu'on apprécie les jeux de rôles, il est difficile de ne pas avoir entendu parler de Final Fantasy 7 tant il a marqué un grand nombre de gens. J'ai pour ma part découvert la série avec l'épisode 8, donc l'aspect nostalgie n'a pas joué. Il est également difficile de juger un jeu plus de 20 ans après sa sortie sans avoir un avis biaisé par tout ce qu'on a connu entre-temps, mais je vais essayer. Je ne parlerai pas de l'histoire en détails mais il s'agit d'un des deux points forts du jeu (avec les combats). Elle est un minimum travaillée et plusieurs grandes révélations viendront ponctuer votre avancée. Dans les combats, le système de matérias (source de magie permettant de lancer un ensemble de magies) qui se combinent entre elles est très efficace et récompensera vraiment ceux qui chercheront à les faire évoluer et à les dupliquer. Malheureusement, les plus utiles et les plus puissantes sont obtenues uniquement vers la fin du jeu, ce qui donne l'impression d'un système un peu inutilisé. Seule la volonté d'aller battre les boss les plus puissants du jeu vous donnera une raison d'exploiter au maximum ce système.
Pour finir, ce n'est pas un mauvais jeu, mais il accuse son âge et je me suis probablement habitué à moins d'obscurité sur le contenu et le fonctionnement du jeu avec les jeux modernes. L'ergonomie est également moyenne. Je le conseille à ceux qui veulent l'expérience originale avec la sortie récente du remake, mais sachez à quoi vous attendre.
Mention spéciale pour le français : la traduction semble avoir été bâclée et de nombreuses incohérences sont présentes dans le jeu. On comprend ce qui se passe, mais certaines phrases n'ont pas de sens et pourront vous sortir de l'immersion.
Côté succès : La plupart concernent l'évolution de vos personnages, mais une bonne moitié ne seront pas aussi évidents que ça à obtenir sans un minimum de connaissances du jeu au préalable. C'est un jeu à l'ancienne, où il fallait aller parler à tous les personnages dans tous les villes pour être sûr de ne rien rater. Pour ceux qui ne veulent perdre du temps à refaire une partie pour un ou deux objets oubliés, un guide est fortement conseillé.

When you like role playing games, it is difficult not to have heard about Final Fantasy 7 as it has left its mark on many. On my side, I discovered the serie with the 8th episode, so nostalgia was not here. It is also difficult to review a game more than 20 years after its release with no distortion due to everything you have known meanwhile, but I will try. I will not speak about the story in details but it is one of the two strengths of the game (with fights). It is enough elaborated and few big revelations will come through your progress. In fights, the system of materias (magic source that allow to cast a set of spells) that can be combined is very efficient and will reward people who develop and duplicate them. Unfortunately, the most useful and the most powerful ones are obtained only near the end of the game, giving a impression of a unused system. Only the will to beat the best boss of the game will give you a reason to exploit this system at its maximum.
Finally, it is not a bad game, but it is old and I was probably used to less austerity on content and game systems with modern games. Ergonomics is average. I can recommend this game to people who want the original experience with the recent release of the remake, but you know what to expect.
About achievements : Most of them are about story or characters progress, but a good half will not be so easy to obtain without a minimum knowledge of the game first. It is a old school game, where you had to speak to every character in every city to make sure to miss nothing.

After an easy install of 7th Heaven, you can easily download & apply the mods you want. I've download about 3/4 of what's there, resulting in a true HD remake of the game. 

Coming from someone who looks at the PSX era of JRPG games as the very pinnacle of the genre, the 7th Heaven version is as good or better than classics like: Suikoden II, Xenogears, Tales of Destiny II, FFXI, Front Mission III, and others. EVEN if you've played the modern remake... this version still has value, mostly because of the classic turn-based combat. Hour after hour, scene after scene, battle after battle, I'm constantly amazed by it. You NEED to have this experience! 

Loved the music, story line, characters, battle system, mini games, and character development. There are several optional characters you can acquire as well. I didn't spend much time on side quests, but there's plenty to keep you busy. 

One knock against it is that the final battles were a bit much. At times, the story progression was a bit disjointed too, leaving you unsure on how to proceed. Overall, I think it lives up to the hype.

The pc version is just the best version, it allows you to break the game and still have a blast with it. Another reason this game is the best on pc is because you can mod it. I personally modded it to look more like a ps2 game so its a little better on the eyes. But its ok if you not into that and prefer the old look everyone is free to enjoy the game how they want to.

The computer controls are weird and getting a controller to work for the game is a bit clunky as well. I personally would play it on a console over a PC since it plays better on it. The materia system was a favorite of mine and I loved the character designs they made for the game (minus Cait Sith.) The story is pretty mediocre since 25% of it is about fighting a corrupt organization from destroying the environment and the other 75% is stopping a megalomaniacal super soldier from hurling a space rock at the planet so that he can absorb the planets essence to become a god. However, the story is indeed dated from the old PS1 days which is why it will get a pass. The only major gripe I have with the game is that the late game has not aged well. In order to take down the super bosses, you need to do it in a specific way. This shows the lack of creativity for those bosses in letting the players use the collected materia, items, and weapons in whatever load out they choose to take them down. I also don't like how some things within the game are permanently missable (which people complained about in games like Golden Sun yet Final Fantasy 7 was far more egregious with it.) Outside of those things, the game is a great game and is indeed a classic from the PS1 days.",1611343597,1611343597,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This games story is unique and creative. I have never heard anything like it, and it kept me hooked for the entire 55 hour adventure.

The combat is simple, yet fun (for a turn based jrpg), and the Materia system keeps things fresh and exciting, allowing you to come up with all different kinds of combinations and strategies. And the fact that you can put any Materia on any character, means you can have any character fill any role, witch is extremely useful.

The characters so are lovable and memorable. With the exception of Yuffie, there was not a single character I disliked. Cloud acts cold but truly cares for his friends. Barret is super passionate about everything. Tifa always puts herself into danger to help others. Aerith (NOT AERIS) was always cheerful and would motivate everyone to do their best. Red XIII had no admirable traits whatsoever, but I loved him anyway because hes a good boi. Cait Sith is pretty strange and goofy, but always has the best intentions with his actions. Vincent was just cool and I liked that he could turn into a beast for his limit break. And Cid, while a jerk at times, always did what he thought was best for everyone.

This game also has one BANGER of an OST. There is not a single song in the soundtrack that I dont like. Some of my favorites in no particular order are: Bombing Mission, Anxious Heart, Tifa's theme, Those Who Fight, Flowers Blooming in the Church, Oppressed People, Those Who Fight Further, J-E-N-O-V-A, Cosmo Canyon, Aerith's Theme, and One-Winged Angel. Oh and the best song ever created, ELECTRIC DE CHOCOBO BABY! This game has my favorite OST of all time, and I don't see that changing.

And then there are the moments, the most unforgettable part about this game. There are so many moments in this game that are forever embedded in my mind. The first bombing mission. The plate falling on sector 7. Rescuing Aerith from Shinra tower (take the stairs, trust me). Learning about Nibelheim. The first fight with Jenova. The date at the Gold Saucer. Learning about Sephiroth's plan. The big spoiler at the end of part 1. The Reunion. Clouds character development. The final battle with Sephiroth. All of these moments were written so well. I am not someone who gets emotional very easily, and I went into this game knowing a big spoiler. And even with that knowledge, when the spoiler happened in game I felt my chest get tight and my eyes start to water. This is one of three games that have actually made me emotional while playing.

I can not recommend this game enough. Even if you don't like turn based rpg's just give it a shot. It is one of the most important video games I have ever played. This was my first Final Fantasy game, and I can't wait to see what the rest of the series has in store. If the other games are anything like this one, they are all going to be unforgettable adventures.",1611299977,1611300202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played through it a few times and I can say that this game truly deserves a medal. I honestly believe that it is the best game that has ever been made based on several factors.
For me, Storyline is a big factor. FF7 is a game that actively progresses through the story. There are no long breaks where nothing seems to happen. The plot is immense, with surprises, twists, and excitement.
The actual battling is turn based, rapid, and thrilling. Containing an almost never ending assortment of difficult and amusing enemies and bosses that will keep you entertained throughout all three disks(physical copy).
Graphics wise, the game is not lacking. Considering it was released 1997(EU) when this game actually was THE game to revolutionize RGP-genre. Although the characters may be somewhat blocky, the battles and cut scenes are magnificent.
The soundtracks is my second favorite parts of the game. The soundtrack fits very well with the gameplay and the battle themes are just amazing.

While it definitely isn't a modern RPG, this has all the roots that made modern games the way they are and was the standard by which all other RPGs of the time were judged.  As long as you go into this game expecting a slightly turn based battle system, polygon characters, dialogue bubbles instead of voice overs then you won't be disappointed.

The Materia system which this game uses is one of the best systems of the early JRPGs.  It allows the player to be flexible with their characters and choose the combat style that best fits them.  And the further into the game you get the more complex it becomes.

But the big reason people keep coming back to this game is the relateable characters and the amazing story.  Each character has realistic emotions, and problems.  Their back stories are some of the most flashed out on all of the Final Fantasy games, even to date.  The main villain, Sephiroth, is iconic and well deserving of his notoriety.

This story is so grand that the current remake has to be split into several parts in order to tell it again.  If you play FFVII Remake, it'll leave you with tones of questions that the original will answer for you.

[h1] It’s really hard to review your favorite game of all time… [/h1]

I’m sure some of you are rolling your eyes after reading the sentence above. “OH, how original! Another person who says that FF7 is the best game of all time. YAWN”. Well, I can’t say I blame you,  but that’s just the thing, I don’t think I am in the same boat when it comes to why I love FF7 so much, and if you give me a chance, I would like to tell you why. Now, I’ve been trying to review the game properly but there is just so much to write about that I simply can’t fit it into an entire review. So, instead of giving you a proper review, I will instead tell you my story about how I first played Final Fantasy 7, how I finished it and how it is still my favorite game of all time.

[h1] I just wanted a game where I could name the main character after myself… [/h1]

I’m pretty sure it was 1997. I was in the 7th grade of elementary school. While all my friends were busy playing Counter Strike https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/, I was busy playing whatever I could play on my Playstation or some really ancient games that still worked on my half-working PC. Anyway, in my class, there was this one boy, let’s call him Pete. He was kind of a bully to everyone, except for me. He didn’t bully me because we shared a similar topic, which was video games. Whenever he went on a bullying spree of bullying anyone he could see, he would skip me, and even chat with me for a while about games. It was a weird relationship but I am glad that I got to know him because if it weren’t for him, I never would have gotten into JRPGs. We would often talk about our favorite games and would ever swap them between us. Now, back in the day, in my country nobody could afford to buy 50$ games so we, of course, had pirated copies that we burned. I should feel bad but I really didn’t know any better, heck, official stores sold burned copies of games. 

One day, I asked Pete if he had a Playstation (1) game where I could name my character after myself. He thought about it for a minute and told me that he had one. He didn’t know much about it and he hadn’t really played it for all that long but he could lend it to me. Great, I thought, and the next day, he brought me Final Fantasy VII … on two disks. Final Fantasy veterans know that the original game was on 3 CDs (the PC version was actually on 4 CDs), so did Pete bring me only the first 2 disks? No, he actually brought me two exact copies of the first disk but more on that later.

Anyway, I came home, put the disk in, named Cloud after myself and there I was, ready for my adventure.

[h1] An RPG? What’s that? [/h1]

If it wasn’t very obvious from the above paragraph, I’d like to point out that I had ZERO prior knowledge about this game’s popularity, its cinematic trailers or what JRPGs were in general. Again, I just wanted a game where I could name my character. 

I have never played a game before where, out of nowhere, enemies would appear but I really liked the main character Cloud (named after me) because he had that huge sword. I loved how after each battle he would get stronger and eventually level up. It took me quite a while to get how to play this game but I was determined to learn. This was also one of the first games that made me stop and read what was on the screen. As I progressed more and more through the game, one thing became perfectly clear to me: [h3] I definitely got more than just a game where I could name my character [/h3]

[h1] My friends and family were with me [/h1]
It really seems silly to think about this today but all other party members I named after my friends and family. My best friend got Barret, my sister got Tifa (man, that was awkward), my elementary school crush got Aerith, Red XIII got my cat’s name, Caith Sith got my cousin’s name, Cid got my other best friend’s name, Yuffie got my best friend’s sister's name and by the time I found Vincent, I had no more names to give, so I just named him after my dad. So there we were, my little army of friends and family all on a journey to save the planet from the evil corporations, or were we?

[h1] A villain I actually feared [/h1]

If you play this game today, it mostly plays like any other JRPG. The graphics are a little hard to swallow sometimes but the overall gameplay is still very much playable. Sure, sometimes it can be grindy but most of the time it’s very much tolerable. What always gets me through the game is leveling up my materia (magic and abilities earn xp and level up). After I learned how to manage my materia properly, and it took me quite a while, I felt like a genius. It still didn’t prepare me for what was about to come.

 Unlike all the heroes, I couldn’t name the main villain. When I first heard of Sephiroth, I was genuinely afraid of him. Not afraid, like hiding under the covers, but afraid in a sense of thinking about eventually facing him in battle. Even today, I don’t think there is a single villain in any medium that gets a better build-up and introduction like Sephiroth does. I remember saying to myself: “There’s no way, I could ever beat him”, yet I kept going. It didn’t help that as the game progressed and as I reached the end of disk one, I was learning more and more about Sephiroth’s amazing power, but that’s when it happened. [spoiler] When Sephiroth killed Aerith (she had my elementary school crush’s name) [/spoiler], that’s when I really came to fear him as I had never experienced something like that in a video game before. And, then Disk 1 ended and I didn’t have Disk 2. Rembmer, I had two copies of disk 1.

[h1] I went looking for disk 2 (and 3) and it took me months to find them [/h1]

In my country, nobody really cared about any other game if it wasn’t Counter Strike, so locating a Playstation game, let alone a multiple disc one, was a hard feat. I eventually managed to find a copy and the shop owner was surprised why I only needed the second and third disk. After getting home and inserting the disk, my save game wouldn’t load. Why? Because, they were from the NTSC region and I had the Pal region of the first disk. I went back to the shop and got the first disk (NTSC) and played the game again from the beginning. After witnessing IT again, I finally loaded disk 2 and was ready to continue the game.

[h1] The last boss kicked my butt [/h1]

I managed to get to the last boss and he kicked my butt. I was really underleveled and my material sucked. So, that’s when I went on a grinding journey where I leveled up all my characters and material to the max level after which I finally did it. Yes, my family, friends and I saved the world in Final Fantasy VII.

Only years later did I go online and find out that this game was actually really popular. I had no idea but was really glad that many people shared my love for the game.

[h1] Sorry for the lack of review but I felt like this game deserved something special [/h1]

Sure, nostalgia has a lot to do with why this is my favorite game of all time, but even years later, when I have less tolerance for games, I still think Final Fantasy VII is a great RPG. It’s fun to grind material levels and it’s fun to do all other extra activities in the game. The story is incredibly complex but dear to me and it always makes me laugh when I remember how all the main characters used to have the names of my friends and family.

When FF7 was originally launched on the PS1 I didn't play it since I never owned that console (jumped from 16 bits straight to 64). I later played it a bit on the ancient emulator Bleem!, which didn't work that well and had the game freeze on me at an important part.

Several years, later, tempted by the incredible FF7 PC modding community (Reunion, Remako) and the new remake, I purchased it on Steam and played it until the end.

What an experience. I grew up with the incredible experience of its predecessor on the SNES and held it on a separate level than most other JRPGs, and safe to say that this one is right up there with it. The music, plot, mechanics and even graphics, somewhat improved by the Remako mod (neural upscale of the textures) are great and hold up incredibly well today.

At one point in life I ditched consoles for PC and with it I focused more on CRPGs than JRPGs. I'm glad I'm returning to them and playing those greats I missed.

Since both have isometric (mostly) graphics, pre-rendered backgrounds, a rich story and were both cornerstones of their genre, launching it to new highs, I'd say that Final Fantasy VII is a Japanese Baldur's Gate, a feeling I had from the beginning to end and from my part, a gigantic plus.

For years I had heard this game hyped up as one of the greatest and most important video games of all time. This game was made in 1997, two years before I was even born, so I have no nostalgic connection to this game. Hell, I've never even played a Final Fantasy game prior to playing this one. Finally, I got around to playing it and I can say that I think it is completely worth the hype. I personally love the timed turn-based RPG combat system and the materia system is also great. But where the game truly shines brightest for me is in its story, characters, and soundtrack. I cannot tell you how much time I have spent listening to songs from this game's soundtrack. 

The main fighting theme cues up every single time you hit a random encounter, and while the random encounters can certainly get annoying sometimes, the fighting theme never does for me. The characters have their own themes, and every character is unique from one another.  All 9 party members bring something new to the table, I could gush about them for hours. While the graphics may not hold up beautifully today, the art style and design of each of these characters certainly do. Even the two optional characters matter a great deal. In-fact, in my opinion Yuffie and Vincent shouldn't even be optional, because missing them is like missing a part of the story in my eyes.

Speaking of which, the story is brilliant. What starts as a cool but simple premise continually amps up and evolves throughout the run-time and I love it. There was one moment that is basically spoiled for everyone at this point thanks to the internet (and if it's not spoiled for you consider yourself lucky! Play before you do get it spoiled), but the moment still had an impact even when I knew it was coming. Yet the game follows that up with what was, at least to me, an even bigger twist that I had no idea was coming. There were several twists and turns and moments that left my jaw on the floor or had me react viscerally, sometimes verbally in one way or another. From the sweet character moments to the insane plot twists, this game has it covered for me in the story department.

I'm excited to play this game again someday. I consider it now to be one of my favorites. I know it's over 20 years old and the graphics are nothing special by today's standards, and turn-based combat with random encounters may not be for everybody, but I truly hope that more people in my generation will play this game at least so I have someone to talk to about it.

The greed of mankind has pushed the world to the brink of destruction. The folly of mankind evokes imagery of globalization-gone-wrong, the economic boom, and the destructive force of nuclear power. Yes, it's a Japanese story from the '90s. It plays with the concept of spirits and life force persisting through our physical bodies. To construct a mechanism around mining the spirits of the planet is so extremely twisted beyond reason. Shinra isn't simply just destroying their world - they are, in a sense, eroding their own memories, the spirits of their ancestors. It's a cautionary tale for the next generation to not forget themselves, to always respect their elders and the natural world. But this story was plenty powerful to me as an American in 2020, too. How much the people of the planet had given away over time for the convenience of a corporation that supplies easy energy and transportation. The folks in FFVII know their world is falling apart but they are hopeless against infallible systems that distract them by permitting tiny freedoms. It is insanely topical. 

But like the best FFs, there's that juicy, grounded emotional core about the very human experience. Moving away, dealing with the loss of the parent, feeling left out. No matter how grand these fantasy tales get, there's always that acknowledgement that the human struggles in the real world are just as fantastical. FFVII addresses its audience with a thoughtfulness that gamers are already prone to isolation and insecurity. It explores how to navigate those feelings, where they come from, and what life can look like if you live it with honesty and self-actualization.

So yeah, I love this game deeply. And these kinds of stories are critically important for people to experience. But it's also got random battles, the translation can be memey, and the steam port has DRM. So. You know. I guess it's just the same kind of trash as every other video game at the end of the day.",1609905916,1609905995,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

It takes a bit of finagling with the button mapping to get it to run decently on a controller, and in the update to PC it's less been remastered than just reconsidered and smoothed over slightly. In general, this is almost the exact same experience people will have had on the PS1 back in the day.

The game itself is very good. The story goes on a lot of interesting tangents, the music is top-notch superb, the gameplay is engaging. It's got a lot of small minigames which don't really come up again or have a great deal of depth, but a lot of them (such as the motorbike, the submarine, the snowboard, etc) are all replayable at a later date. Things like the submarine and the Fort Condor minigame feel less like key parts of the story and more like aspects that Square were just incredibly excited to work on and were shunted into the game – and it's quite hard to criticise in good faith that amount of enthusiasm from a dev team.

The real star of the game is the Materia system, which is incredibly elegant. Your characters grow and level as the game progresses, but all of their magic/summons/extra commands are independent of them, levellable separately as the game goes on with their own improvements. While I've seen some people criticise this for making the characters feel interchangeable, I never had that – Cait Sith is never going to be a physical attacker regardless of how much you buff him, and Barrett will never be the best mage. It consists more of making you think about the best choices. This especially came to the front with the Battle Square – with one character only and (if you're late-game) an absolute deluge of potential choices, it becomes more like a puzzle than anything else. That said, I would have killed for a simple “save these Materia to this character” button to prevent the inevitable unequipping and re-equipping when I decide that I really should give Vincent a try.

Not only was it graphically groundbreaking for its time, but it also has a story that stands the test of time. The gameplay def feels dated now, but as long as you don't mind turn based combat, there are still many ways to make it fun. The Materia system allows you to replay the game and build the characters in different ways. You can make someone who would otherwise be a melee weapon character into a spellcaster, and vice versa. There is also tons of side content beyond the main story that turns this 26-30 hour game into a 60 hour+ adventure. With the Remake out now, it may be tempting to just play that to get a modern version, but trust me, the Remake is far more enjoyable if you have played the original as there are numerous instances of foreshadowing to later parts of the original story, that haven't happened yet in the Remake (which only takes place in the game's opening act). This is a classic that deserves playing by any fan of the genre, and if you want to update its looks, then look into modding it (search for 7th heaven FFVII) and look for the Qhimm forums, has instructions and a mod installer there. If you're a FFVII veteran and looking for a more challenging adventure, I highly recommend the New Threat mod which increases the difficulty substantially and demands that you use all of the game's mechanics (and even adds more gameplay mechanics) to win.

This is likely particularly true with the recent release of the FFVII Remake.  So, this review will be split into two for each potential player.

Review for new players:

With the video game world marching forward into the third dimension with the Playstation, Square endeavored to bring one of its most popular franchises into new territory with FFVII.  Thanks to the massive global marketing of the Playstation system, FFVII brought in the most newcomers to the series than each of the previous titles.  The game brings many established elements of [i]Final Fantasy[/i] into a new generation while contributing its own unique elements to varying degrees of success.

After leaving a corporation-controlled special forces unit, Cloud Strife finds himself in Midgar working with a childhood friend in a terrorist rebellion group opposed to that corporation.  After crossing paths with a sweet, seemingly-naive girl called Aeris whom is being hunted for being an ""Ancient,"" Cloud is forced to acknowledge a dark part of his path in the form of Sephiroth.  Determined to stop the corporation and to ascertain Sephiroth's plans, Cloud and company embark on a journey of identity, redemption, memory, and perseverance.  The world will be destroyed in seven days.  Cloud's group of misfits are the only hope of salvation.

FFVII has one of the biggest legacies in video gaming.  FFVII has developed such a voluminous following, that it has reached the point of the ""Kardashian effect"": It's really popular because it's popular.  This is not to demean the game in anyway.  It is very good.  However, newcomers should come into the experience with the proper expectations thqt are not biased from twenty-three years of nostalgia.  

Those who had played FFIII (US title) found a lot of similar game mechanics in FFVII.  The method (and look) of world traversing, the battle system, the ensemble cast of characters, and even the 2.5D movement feel very similar to FFIII.  FFVII introduces several new aspects to the series in its limit system (a.k.a. overdrive, limit break, and trance mode), the CGI scenes, a heavy usage of mini games, and a much darker atmosphere.  FFVII left the realm of high fantasy for urban fantasy.  This journey into urban fantasy was met with mixed reception.  Newcomers to the series found a lot to love about the atmosphere.  Many established fans were so dismayed that Square essentially created FFIX as a ""return to [i]Final Fantasy[/i].  Whether or not a potential player will enjoy the darker atmosphere will largely depend on whether they want a journey of magic and whimsy with very real moments of tragedy or a journey filled with strife and tribulations with some moments of whimsy.

FFVII does many aspects of JRPG's extremely well.  First, its story is deep and immersive.  While loosely done in earlier [i]Final Fantasy[/i] titles, FFVII puts great effort into the backstory of the antagonist on top of the main party.  There are a few moments that will elicit genuine strong emotions from the player.  The battle system is intuitive, particularly those familiar with FFVI's esper system or FFV's job system.  The soundtrack cannot compare to those of FFVI or FFIX, but the music has many haunting tracks and a great variety of arrangements that flow very well with different situations.  The music is one of Uematsu's better endeavors.  

FFVII does some things poorly.  The pacing of all the Playstation-era [i]Final Fantasy[/i] games can be atrocious, particularly with regard to battles.  Battles quickly become a series of pressing the same button(s) repeatedly with no real opportunity for player immersion (except for the boss battles, of course).  The mini games are mostly awful and seem to only be included to showcase the 2.5D world.  Anyone who says that the bar-swinging or dolphin-jumping sequences (You'll know them when you get to them.) are intuitive is lying.

What is FFVII's greatest strength might also be one of its weaknesses.  FFVII has a few huge, epic, series-defining moments.  In fact, if you've never played the game, you probably still know the biggest event in the game (in terms of emotional power).  However, FFVII then becomes what is a small sequence of powerful moments with a less grandiose story connecting them.  Some of these moments do not fit exceedingly well into the world as a whole as well as they could.  FFVII is epic in all of its various aspects.  And yet, this epic-ness does not leave room for subtlety.

Any fan of JRPG's should give FFVII a try.  It has a fantastic story to tell and does so in an immersive way.  It embraces many of the characteristics of what a [i]Final Fantasy[/i] game should be while maintaining a unique identity.  That being said, a player would be better served trying FFVII on a console as opposed to Steam.  The Steam version of FFVII requires that you connect to Square Enix's online servers to play, which is utterly unnecessary and burdensome.  The controls are adequate but awkward (but can be rectified with certain controllers).  Also, the sound uses MIDI versions, which are not nearly as crisp as the original.  If a player only has access to a computer, then the Steam version will suffice.

Review for veterans of FFVII:

As a source of nostalgia, the Steam version of FFVII is adequate, but it is completely lacking compared to other ports.  Simply put, the Steam port negatively impacts the game.  Players should play FFVII on a console, if possible.

The best part of the Steam port is the visuals, which have been updated and smoothed from the Playstation original.  Cutscenes are made more immersive with these improved graphics, and the summon scenes are even more breath-taking.  Unfortunately, that is really all the positives regarding the port.

The audio uses MIDI versions of the the music.  As MIDI usage is becoming less popular, many computers do not have high-quality synthesizers.  Thus, the audio may very well sound objectively worse than on the original version.  There are mods available that replace with music with other versions, however.

The keyboard controls are somewhat intuitive but still awkward.  Some controllers work well with this port, however most do not seem to allow usage of the D-pad.  Those interested in buying the Steam version should have a controller or plan on purchasing a controller.

The Steam version of FFVII requires that players connect to Square Enix's servers.  For a twenty-three-year-old single-player game, this connection is unnecessary and needlessly burdensome.  

Overall, I cannot recommend the Steam version of FFVII unless it is the player's only option.",1599529310,1608699725,False,47,4,0.692507922649383545,0,True,False,False

I can never shake the feeling that it's a poorly translated game, and I just don't think anyone would deny it. I guess that's part of its charm.

The music is great. Graphics have aged poorly but I'll just call them great, because they are appealing in a retro way. Gameplay ranges from solid to tedious.

This was my first time going through Final Fantasy VII. I had had many people over the years talk a lot about it in both being the greatest FF game and also being overrated. I thought it was final time to go through it entirely to make an honest assessment. 

I always be honest with these ratings and will show how much I went through the game. In most cases and since these are mostly RPGs, I will go through them in their entirety and pick up all of the trophies along with that. And now the breakdown:

[h2]Writing (29/40)[/h2]
[h3]Narrative (12/15)[/h3]
Final Fantasy VII has a pretty good narrative. This being the first time I have ever played VII, I was pleasantly surprised how much it held up after years of hearing about it from basic pop culture.

[h3]World Building (3/5)[/h3]
FFVII has a pretty good narrative. This being the first time I have ever played VII, I was pleasantly surprised how much it held up after years of hearing about it from basic pop culture.

[h3]Character Building (5/5)[/h3]
I have been hearing for years about how ""emo"" Cloud is and how his character is wrapped up into his pain. I would disagree after actually playing it. Cloud has great characterization and changes over the course of events. Definitely stand up to time. Sephiroth is not that great of a villain (nor is he really the villain; he's more of a lackie for JENOVA) but I can see his appeal from his design and build up. All other characters are built up very well including Avalanche even though they do not make it to the end.

[h3]Lore (3/5)[/h3]
There is a fair amount of history that is implied by the game but its not terribly deep. Basically you have the lore surrounding the ancients and that's about it. Not much greater depth than ""there were ancient peoples and technology/magic""

[h3]Dialog (3/5)[/h3]
Dialog is fine. Nothing terrible about it but textboxes can only go so far in implying emotions.

[h3]Originality (3/5)[/h3]
The story overall is most unique at the beginning of the game: eco-terrorist group Avalanche verses corporation trying to drain the planet of its resources. The Rest of the game trend back into ancient civilization vanished and left behind technology (Magic) that can destroy the world. Tack on the villain ""thinks they are better because they are <whatever the villain is other than human>"". Looking at history, one of the first video games to do this well but not the most interesting story over time.

[h2]Gameplay (32/50)[/h2]
[h3]Main Game Mechanics (10/15)[/h3]
This is the basic FF ATB system. IV had it. VI had it. Now with Materia. Materia is a great way to allow characters to have different roles throughout the game and change them as needed. Levels matter but not by a ton. Both are not my favorite systems in games but they certainly work.

[h3]Side Game Mechanics (5/5)[/h3]
There are side content everywhere in this game, sometimes to the games determent. Minigames to block progress is not a fun mechanic but most of those did not require good scores. Plenty of things to do if you don't want to do the rest of the games content: Chocobo racing, an RTS game, entire section of just minigames to earn possible prizes.

[h3]Game Balance (2/3)[/h3]
Limiting moves to what Materia you have greatly constrains the player to how powerful they can be at one time. There is no way to completely jump power stages and potentially ruin the challenge. Late game I think the ceiling is too high for what competition is out there. This hampers it, especially with...

[h3]Post Game Content (2/5)[/h3]
...the Weapons being joke post bosses. Ultima Weapon is a pushover for being called Ultima. I believe I took him down at Lvl 60. I had had Ruby and Emerald built up for years as difficult bosses. I ruined the Ruby fight because I figured out the power of Mime and more importantly the power of Final-Phoenix. I expected since that was an easy association to find there would be post game bosses that actually required that sort of set up. This didn't happen once in the Ruby fight. Hades and Knights of the Round with W-Summon is much too strong. I was so disgusted that for Emerald, I didn't use any of that after I got to Level 90 and just took on the boss (with 8 Materia on everyone) and no cheap 7777 tricks or spamming Mime. Just a straight fight and Emerald was a joke. I like challenging extra bosses but I think the ATB system hampers interesting tactical endgame bosses. There are some other quests in post game like the Battle Zone and getting the Complete Materia if you like Grinding. If you are a hunter of trophies, there will be lots of AP grinding in store for you.

[h3]Graphics (2/5)[/h3]
The graphics on the original are serviceable. Not great but they work. There are times that the graphics started to get in the way of my ability to do things properly but mostly works fine.

[h3]User Interface (4/5)[/h3]
Generally clear and working. This may only be for the PC port but there were several times that button choices for minigames were very unclear since it did not use ""X"" or ""B"" buttons but instead ""SELECT"" and ""MENU""

[h3]World/Level Design (3/5)[/h3]
I do not like games with Overworlds as compared to connected pieces of land. I think the latter adds the realism and world depth. VII is an overworld style game that works fine. The interiors are great mazes and mirror their environments well; the twists of haphazard construction in the slums of the different sections of Midgar to the uniformity in the Shinra building.

[h3]Accessibility (2/2)[/h3]
The ATB battle system is easy to grasp and Materia easily explain themselves how they work; its just a different form of equipment that has spells inside it. 

[h3]Replayability (1/3)[/h3]
There are not very different ways I could see trying to play this again and since Materia make characters more or less interchangeable, there is very little reason to replay this again.

[h3]Originality (1/2)[/h3]
Materia is really the only thing the makes the game original in gameplay. Almost every other aspect has been done by a Final Fantasy game before it.

[h2]Miscellaneous (7/10)[/h2]
[/h3]Music (4/5)[/h3]
Overall, the music is quite good. I wish there was a different battle theme for regions to shake things up but otherwise I can see myself jamming out to it later.

[h3]Subjective Rating (3/5)[/h3]
There game is fine. I would recommend for people to play once in their life. I would say its narrative is better part of the game than its battle system. 

[h1]Total (68/100)[/h1]
In closing, Final Fantasy VII was a good game. It definitely is a product of its time but mostly holds up until now. I do not think it is fitting of the greatest game of all time but most of our old favorites are not. If its your favorite game ever, don't let this dissuade you from liking it, and definitely recommend someone who hasn't played it to do so at least once.

Very vague ideas are tossed around without much thought put into how they work or what their intended purpose is. While VII is far from the worst in this regard, its nature as one of several chances for the series to move into the NES era of game design - when games began understanding their own fundamentals - turns it into something utterly disappointing. While it exists as a standout in videogame stories and story-telling even to this day, attempting to find any value in its combat system is a fool's errand.

In any turn-based game, strategy and decision-making are pivotal. Turn-to-turn decisions that can change the outcome of a fight are important, as is enabling the player to think several turns ahead and make plans that can ultimately decide the outcome of the battle. These are both things missing from this franchise. Various mechanics in this game, while theoretically sound, are completely invalidated by the iron fist of Square's enemy design. Do you want to build around status effects? Sorry, most enemies are immune to them. Is a boss giving you trouble? Well don't go looking for better strategies, just optimise your damage output.

As an RPG, FFVII, like the rest of the franchise, tends towards being brainless. You just get into the habit of Nuke > Heal > Nuke > Heal. Your strongest attack every turn, while your healer keeps the party topped up, even if they're at fairly high health already, as it's very common for an enemy to randomly pick one of their much stronger moves when you're not expecting it. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of a need to manage resources. When you can store such massive supplies of every item, the need to ration them out or be discerning with them ceases to exist.

The argument could exist then, that the games are supposed to be more casual, to encourage a laxadaisical approach to the game, something to enjoy on the side while you consume the story. And yet if such is the case, then why are so many of the game's mechanics completely unusable? Enemy Skill is a very interesting concept, effectively adding a neat sidequest for the player as they collect weird and unconventional abilities... but the vast majority of the moves it provides are either useless, or their narrow conditions for activation are deliberately avoided by the developers (ie. setting most enemy levels outside the multiples of level-specific skills).

If they want the game to be breezy and let players do whatever they want, then it needs to actually *let them*. If the game wants to be tactical, then it needs to actually open the door to tactics beyond the overly simplistic loop of Nukings. A DPS race simply shouldn't be the start and end of the gameplay.",1423144698,1608462128,False,1,2,0.472751140594482422,0,True,False,False

As a person whose always really appreciated jrpgs, especially ps2 era ones, I found VII living up to the hype surrounding it. The story aged like fine to me, many many elements and messages growing more and more relevant over time. The tone is pretty dark throughout, There always is a somber melancholy following the party whether it be in the music, the backgrounds, the ambience, it is super effective at selling you a mood. it really helps ground the world.

[b] Overview/Summary [/b]

Cloud Strife is the main protagonist of this game, he is an EX-SOLDIER socially distant Mercenary with a dark past, who will take any job for money. Careless to the condition of his world or society, he lives solely for himself. He is enlisted by the eco-terrorist insurgent group known as AVALANCHE, though he often bumps heads with the groups leader, Barret Wallace, due to Cloud's disregard for life and anything but his own goals. AVALANCHE opposes the action's and goal's of the Shinra Electric Power Company, who seek to misuse Mako for profit, and eventually kill the Planet, Gaea. The question is will Cloud come to term's with his past? And save the planet from destruction?

-It's Final Fantasy 7
-You can mod it

-Because it's an update of the old PC port, the button prompts are all generic terms like [confirm], [switch], etc. making quick time events a pain in the ass.
-Cloud saves are through Square's own service, not Steam.  It sometimes goes down around the holidays if there are too many new players logging in.
-Some mods disable achievements and cloud saves.
-The ""character booster"" is currently broken.  It requires that you save the game and upload it to their cloud service.  You then need to log into your ""online profile"" to enable the booster but there has been a change on their website so you can no longer access it.

In terms of ports, it looks pretty polished for being a polygon mess from 1997. The required log-in to Square is annoying to say the least, but it's a decent port that doesn't feel too different from the original experience from the Playstation 1. 

All that aside, FFVII is my definitive favorite video game of all time. Is it Basic to say that? Probably, but frankly, I don't care. I was 5 years old when this game came out, and I spent many hours watching my mother play it, as it was her game initially. It left a huge imprint on me, and I would try my hand at playing it myself a few times before our PS1 was killed by my cat and before we eventually moved on to the Xbox 360 and I stopped using the PS2 as much. It wasn't until I was in my early 20s that I finally forced myself to finish the game on the original PS1 disc set on our ailing PS2. I don't regret it for a moment. 
The journey of Cloud and the rest of AVALANCHE is one that I could follow over and over. Cloud in particular was the first of several amnesiac (and ambivalent) swordsmen that Square Enix would throw at gamers. Back when this game came out, he was a new kind of protagonist. Tifa was and still is Best Girl, and Barret was the first time I ever saw an African American character in the main cast of a video game. His portrayal hasn't exactly aged well since, but it was very impressionable for me to see Barret in a position of leadership, fighting for the planet. I will never forget the scene at the Temple of the Ancients, nor my shock at what takes place there.
It's been over 20 years since then, but the struggle against an evil corporation bent on profits above the well-being of people and the environment is still quite topical, and I find myself drawn to it more and more. The remake reignited my love of this game and I found it to be a highly enjoyable experience playing that one, too. 

By no means is this - the original Final Fantasy VII - a perfect game, and I know that everyone has opinions on the ""best"" Final Fantasy game. For me, it's this one. I can't recommend it enough.",1605995463,1605995463,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It features a captivating [b]story[/b] full of mysteries to unravel with intriguing plot twists. The story is also surprisingly mature for a FF game focusing on corporate greed, the apathy of common folk who feel powerless to change the status quo, and environmentalism, all topics that are still very relevant today. The characters in the game are also especially well written with complex backstories and motivations, and each clearly has their own personality. The first third of the game is particularly strong in these regards as you work with your fellow insurgents to undermine the efforts of the omnipresent SHINRA Corporation while exploring the city of Midgar. 
The [b]gameplay[/b] is generally engaging with the materia system allowing highly diverse and adaptable customization of your characters' abilities as opposed to the more narrowly focused class system of other Final Fantasy games. The combat keeps you on your toes with it's real time battling system; if you spend a long time scrolling through your spells deciding which one to cast your opponents are probably going to get a free hit or two on you. The speed of combat is adjustable in the games settings however, to suit personal preferences. The system does have some downfalls however as 85% of all the enemies you face can simply be beat by spamming the basic attack command, and magic's strength falls off gradually after the early game, which in turn encourages you to just spam more basic attacks. My personal favorite part about the gameplay are the small interactive moments scattered throughout the story where you're called upon to do an unusual task using your controls in a completely new way. You're never really punished if you do poorly at any of these tasks, instead it just offers a unique way to connect with a moment in the game's world. 
The [b]graphics[/b] despite being very early in the 3D era still do a good job of depicting an interesting and elaborate world and showing off cool combat animations and cutscenes. However, the low resolution of the backgrounds can sometimes make it difficult to tell what the terrain of an area you're in is like (i.e. what parts you can walk on/how to follow the path forward) or where the entrances and ladders are in a particular area. For the latter issue you can use the game's help key which highlights the player (which helps if they are obscured by a wall in the foreground for example) as well as any ladders, entrances, and exits, most of the time. I have to say this is the first time a game's low res graphics actually hindered my ability to play slightly, but on the whole this is a minor complaint.

TL;DR:
Story: 9/10
Gameplay: 8.5/10
Graphics: 8/10 (taking its age into account)
Overall: 8.5/10

I love this Final Fantasy Game, Now I’m not a big fan of Final Fantasy games but This one makes me love RPG games like Octopath Traveler.

I mean look what this game has:
Perfect combat UI
Changing names
The Polygons graphics
Drama Story
Awesome Restaurants
Hotel rooms
(Tifa’s boobs)
And More

The problem is Final Fantasy is like GTA. I mean every time a new final fantasy game comes out the story change means you will never see Cloud again except on Remake so it makes me sad I hope new Final Fantasy will let cloud returns.

Is it the most complex FF game ever? No. (FFX holds that unnecessary title.) Is it the most compelling or well loved FF game ever? That depends on what you're looking for. It is a really fun and engaging story with fun gameplay though. 

Unless you've been living under a rock for the last 23 years you've likely heard of this game and have heard it rumored as the best JRPG ever made. That's a fan-argument that I don't intend to wade into. 

FF7 is my favorite game in the ongoing Final Fantasy franchise. It came at a specific period of my childhood so I have serious nostalgia-goggles for this game and dearly love it. The game does have faults, but none that are derailing. To judge this game you have to look to the era it came out. The late 90's were the end of an era facing an uncertain future. Game companies were still fighting over graphic mediums like cartridges or CD's. Many games were going to fully rendered 3D graphics while others tried to hang onto the already semi-nostalgic pixel art styles of the 80's NES and SEGA generations. FF7's story is about the loss and grief process, coming to terms with your identity, and confronting uncertainty, even learning to cope with it. Needless to say it spoke directly to my generation which was too young to hang with the 80's kids and old enough to see uncertainty on the horizon. Us 90's generation kids grew up confused. No wonder we were messed up we've always had one foot in the past and one stepping uncertainly toward the future. FF7 wonderfully encapsulates this feeling. 

Ok, maybe I'm putting too much into it, but can you blame me? It's my favorite game for a reason and one that even almost a quarter of a century after its release I still keep coming back to play. I love the story, the characters, and the world in which it lives.",1602558170,1602558170,True,1,0,0.507504701614379883,0,True,False,False

The fight between squaresoft and enix is why we got so many great rpgs on the later systems.

Anyways, here is my pro/con list:


PROS:

- A story of classic love, betrayal, and many twists.

- Secret characters to find and other things.

- Many unique characters to learn about and discover their pasts.

CONS:

- This game does not really work well with modern controllers. It is best recommended to play with Keyboard and mouse. There are parts in the game where you need to click on certain things for puzzles and the controller is hard to use in these sections. If you really need to use a controller for this game, there are mods you can look at to allow this.

There are many things that make this game a great game, and many things that can also turn off people from this game. I believe this was one of the gateway games in making the next generation of rpg's games more popular. I don't think this was the defining game that changed the gaming industry, but i believe it contributed to it changing the game styles on console usage and pc games.

I remember going to Target on the day it released in Australia and buying it. Not really knowing what to expect I loaded it up. I watched an epic cut scene and jumped off a train. For the next few hours I played what was for me, a new genre of game. After a few hours I stopped and thought, I just wasted all my pocket money and birthday money on this??? Sure the story seemed cool, but for a kid who played FIFA, racing games and shooters, the combat was slow and there was too much talking. I returned the game and bought some other piece of trash. 
2 months later something told me try it again. 
I went and bought it again. I slogged it out through Midgar (to me the start is still a chore lol). And the rest is history. I finally completed what is still today, my favourite ever game. I have played it through on every PS release, on the original PC CD release, on the Square Store PC release, on the Steam PC release and on Switch. No game even comes close to the enjoyment I get from entering the open world map, playing through the story finding and maxing materia, breeding Chocobos, Farming the magic pots and the underwater plane, taking down the weapons, and when that's all done, descending the crater...
Still waiting for a game since that ticks all the boxes, and to me, it still doesn't exist.
If you've never played it before. Forget about the graphics, just get it and enjoy a piece of video game history that still can't be topped in so many ways.

The one thing I'm certain is that this game is my most memorable game I've played all year, I had to study a lot to even finish it, learning about enemy drops, items location, materia combinations, and it was one of the most satisfying experiences of the year. The final boss was a delight to beat, after losing two times to him, I dedicated another 10h to grind for some items and levels and when I finally defeated it was totally worth it.

I also have plenty of time on FF12 original and Zodiac Job sytem on PS2. This is my 4th time playing through Final Fantasy 7, once on PS1, 2 and a half times on PS4 and one final time on Steam just recently last month.

As an overall, this game is fine, it doesn't excel anywhere other than the Materia system. With boring characters heading the main plot, a very bogged down trite and contrived ""We need things to happen"" Disk 2 and a very bland over-world divided into 3ish sections I'm left with very mixed opinions on the game. The game is seen as a classic given it's the first PS1 Final Fantasy, but FF2 is far more customizable and gives me characters I care just as much about. (Which is none to very little.) 

I would suggest either FF2 PSP, FF5 SNES, FF8 PS1 or Steam Release (Not Remastered) or FF12 Zodiac Job System for PS2. If you must play it, stay for the Materia system and don't get your hopes up.

Easiest abusable combination to grab is Choco/Mog + Added Effect to inflict stop using your normal attack. The summon also can inflict stop. 6/10 no real objections here but bland compared to other games in the series. (Maybe I'll elaborate more in the comments if anyone asks.

So, let me first get something out of the way: I never played this as a kid. My first time playing this classic was in 2020.

Overall, I do recommend this game, but I have issues with it. Some issues are with the game itself, and some issues are with the port. Port issues: first, anybody playing with a Nintendo Switch Pro controller is going to be disappointed. This port does not support or recognize the Switch controller at all, even though any other game launched through steam has no problem, including if I launch the Epic Game Store launcher to play Dauntless. There is no legitimate way I found to make it work(more on this later).
Second, the controls are clunky. The game does not pay attention to your set buttons. It lists buttons as [OK] or [SWITCH] or [MENU]. So if the game is teaching you how to unequip Materia, it says, ""Press the SWITCH button to unequip."" This is extremely unintuitive, especially when minigames pop up. ""Press OK, CANCEL, AND SWITCH in order to do a squat."" Okay, I'm going to have to look at my configuration to know what you mean.
Third, and the reason for the capital letters at the beginning of this review, is that Square's cloud saving sucks. I lost 20 hours of gameplay because the save files synced wrong. My friend had the same thing happen, and lost even more time. So do yourself a favor and disable it.

Now I'm going to review the game itself, for those like me who have never touched it. I have not actually beaten the game yet, (Partially due to the save erasing itself) but I have a pretty good idea of what this game has to offer.
This game did not age as well as The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time, another classic from just two years later. FFVII really tried to show off the graphics capabilities of the original Playstation, and it did. There are fully animated movies that look really good for 1996. But outside of the movies, the models are wonky. Character's arms are shaped like long hourglasses. It can be hard to tell where this path is that you need to go.
Gameplay itself is pretty good. The combat runs like Chrono Trigger's, with each character having a bar fill up before they attack. The party characters don't feel very different in combat, though. Actions and spells are granted though ""Materia,"" which allows the character equiping them to use the corresponding action/spell. The physical characters are interchangable, same with the two ranged ones. Since any character can use any spell or action, there is literal 'plug and play' to the characters. There can be some interesting trade offs, like a weapon that grants high attack power, but won't allow you to use spells, but most of the time, you're going to want the Materia slot.
The story is great. It has problems sometimes, where you have to do a clunky, one-time minigame to progress the plot, and get old after a while. But eventually, you get invested, and twists start happening, even before the famous death scene.

Now I'm going to share some knowledge with you. There are mods for this game. You can't find them on the Steam workshop, but are easily found on Google (not sure if I can/ should do direct shoutouts here). They fix nearly all the problems I've mentioned here. But there is a cost: no Steam achievements.
I'll let you decide which is better. But for me, the mods I found after losing my motivation because I lost 20 hours of gameplay took this from a 3/5 star game to a 5/5 star game.
Overall recommendation: Buy if you're nostalgic. Mod or buy the remake if you want a better, more balanced and complex experience. Either way, disable cloud saves.",1599614631,1599614631,True,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False

This PC port is terrible. At impactful moments in the story, the music cues are completely wrong, or absent. This game has frozen and crashed on me, which I can never remember the PS1 version doing to me. Either way, a game made more than 20 years ago should run stably on modern systems. There are obvious animation errors in the game, where Cloud won't be holding his sword in scenes where he's miming holding it. 

The translation is strange too, but I'm just used to one version rather than this one. Calling Jenova ""crisis from the sky"" instead of ""calamity from the sky"" feels like a worse call to me. Otherwise, the translation seems clean enough. This would be a good buy if you're a committed fan, but I think if you're new to the game and want to follow the hype, you should check out mods to fix these issues, if the port won't be supported.

FINAL FANTASY VII is an action role-playing game that was developed by the makers of Square Enix.

[h1] Gameplay / Story [/h1]

The metropolis of Midgar owes its progress to Mako energy, but the mining of the raw material has fatal consequences for the planet! A truth that greedy energy company Shinra is trying to cover up. The resistance group AVALANCHE opposes this. For their mission, they hire the mercenary Cloud Strife, who was once part of the Shinra's elite unit. In search of truth, his past leads him into a conflict that decides the fate of the planet.

The story of Final Fantasy VII begins with Cloud Strife joining the anti-Shinra organization Avalanche when they attacked one of the eight Mako reactors in Midgar. On the way back to Avalanche headquarters, Cloud meets the flower seller Aeris Gainsborough. During their next mission, the Avalanches are trapped by President Shinra, but are able to escape before the Mako reactor they sabotaged explodes. However, the reactor explosion hurled Cloud from the upper levels of Midgar into the slums below. He falls through the roof of a church ruin in Sector 5 and lands unharmed in a flower bed, where Aeris introduces himself correctly. Cloud soon agrees to take on the role of her bodyguard, an agreement that comes when a Shinra Turks unit appears at the church to arrest Aeris.

[h1] Combat system [/h1]

Like the three previous Final Fantasy games, Final Fantasy VII uses a combat system called Active Time Battle (ATB). The group members have a bar that fills up continuously. As soon as this bar is full, an action can be selected and carried out. Unlike earlier games in the series, which allowed four to five controllable characters in combat, the group in Final Fantasy VII can consist of a maximum of three characters.

[h1] Information/Review Deutsch [/h1]

FINAL FANTASY VII ist ein Action-Rollenspiel, welches von  den Machern um Square Enix entwickelt wurde. 

[h1] Gameplay/Story [/h1]

Die Metropole Midgar verdankt ihren Fortschritt der Mako-Energie, doch der Abbau des Rohstoffs hat fatale Folgen für den Planeten! Eine Wahrheit, die der habgierige Energiekonzern Shinra zu vertuschen versucht. Die Widerstandsgruppe AVALANCHE stellt sich dem entgegen. Für ihre Mission heuern sie den Söldner Cloud Strife an, der einst Teil der Elite-Einheit Shinras war. Auf der Suche nach Wahrheit führt ihn seine Vergangenheit in einen Konflikt, der über das Schicksal des Planeten entscheidet. 

Die Geschichte von Final Fantasy VII beginnt mit dem Beitritt Cloud Strifes zur Anti-Shinra-Organisation Avalanche, als diese einen Anschlag auf einen der acht Mako-Reaktoren Midgars verübt. Auf dem Rückweg zum Avalanche-Hauptquartier trifft Cloud die Blumenverkäuferin Aeris Gainsborough. Während ihrer nächsten Mission geraten die Mitglieder Avalanches in eine Falle von Präsident Shinra, sie können aber fliehen, bevor der von ihnen sabotierte Mako-Reaktor explodiert. Jedoch wird Cloud durch die Reaktorexplosion von den oberen Ebenen Midgars in die Slums darunter geschleudert. Er fällt durch das Dach einer Kirchenruine in Sektor 5 und landet unverletzt in einem Blumenbeet, wo sich Aeris ihm richtig vorstellt. Cloud erklärt sich bald bereit, die Aufgabe als ihr Bodyguard anzunehmen, eine Vereinbarung, die zustande kommt, als eine Turks-Einheit des Shinra-Konzerns in der Kirche erscheint, um Aeris gefangen zu nehmen.

[h1] Kampsystem [/h1]

Wie die drei vorangegangenen Final-Fantasy-Spiele verwendet Final Fantasy VII ein Active Time Battle (ATB) genanntes Kampfsystem. Hierbei verfügen die Gruppenmitglieder über eine Leiste, die sich kontinuierlich auffüllt. Sobald diese Leiste voll ist, kann eine Aktion ausgewählt und ausgeführt werden. Anders als frühere Spiele der Serie, die vier bis fünf steuerbare Charaktere im Kampf erlaubten, kann die Gruppe in Final Fantasy VII aus höchstens drei Spielfiguren bestehen.

[h1] Pro [/h1]

+ spannende Geschichte
+ guter Umfang
+ damals schöne Grafik
+ stimmiger Soundtrack
+ jede einzelne Nebenquest, ist eigentlich eine kleine Geschichte
+ Fähigkeitsbäume
+ viele Waffen stehen zur Verfügung
+ etliche Aktivitäten
+ Errungenschaften und Trading Cards

[h1] Kontra [/h1]

- Square Enix Account benötigt zum spielen
- Bosskämpfe sind eher träge und einfach
- schlechte Tastaturbelegung

Its a Great game for fans of JRPG and for introducing new fans of the [b]Final[/b] [b]Fantasy[/b] series, and here is why:

[h1]-[/h1] [h1]THE[/h1] [h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1] [h1]-[/h1]

Its a real-time turn base game, basically where time dont stop for you when your strategizing your tactics and enemies will attack you unless you act fast on what you have in your arsenal. 

The gameplay itself is good, pretty strong system wither you use magic mechanics or physical damage orientation as your personal play style against obstacles through out the game.

[h1]-[/h1] [h1]THE[/h1] [h1]VISUALS[/h1] [h1]-[/h1]

Comparing the graphics between the PS1 vs. PC port, the PC port's graphics on the models are enhanced and cleaned but the weird part of the models that bugged me is some of them have a black oval shape on the mouth area look like their mouth is broken and cant close it.

The backgrounds is pretty much the same as the original however since its enchanced, its looks like paintings of landscapes.

[h1]-[/h1] [h1]THE[/h1] [h1]STORY[/h1] [h1]-[/h1]

Personally, good stories in any game interest me from the characters to the world building, it is fascinating to learn and to understand for how their world works.

The Story is the best part of this game, its tells you what the characters want, what drive them, and what is the meaning of that drive, and this includes the villain of what push him into insanity of want to burn the world before him. Exploring the world and understand its rules and its history, and whats at stake.

[h1]-[/h1] [h1]THE[/h1] [h1]CONCLUSION[/h1] [h1]-[/h1]

The game is fun, but can be bit weird in terms of gameplay or character models. The PC port is somewhat the same as the PS1 version but with slightly enhanced visuals, and the story is fantastic.

I've lost hours of gameplay when the game simply freezes in the middle of play several times. Going to certain places causes graphic bugs (going back out of the first elevator area toward the train again caused the character to appear upside down under the world so all I could see were the bottoms of his feet). There's no option to remove the 'pause when in the background' default. The game doesn't support a 'WASD + mouse' gameplay style, it's all on the keyboard. It's all doable, but it's just not comfortable for me. The camera view while running around the outer world is annoying trying to get it pointed where you want.

The game claims 'elemental + materia' gives you resistances, and I recall there being a screen that shows that explicitly in the console version but it's gone in the PC version* [EDIT: Found it, requires hitting 'OK' in the status screen]

Switching screens causes the game to crash, and that's not a great thing to have on a game where SO much is missable that it's almost mandatory to play while having a walkthrough open to make sure you've gotten everything. With the 'pause while in background' going, I can't even switch the music on Pandora while the boat is sailing between Junon and Costa without coming back to exactly where I left it and having to sit and watch it sail (and that has to  happen several times to get all the Condor attacks completed.

This game is, without doubt, the most popular of the saga. This game was the first Final Fantasy I've ever seriously played (my first one was FFVI, via PC, and saved after getting a Game Over in Mt. Koltz lmao 9 year-old me was a bit of a mess). My brother kept telling me to train and reach a certain level before going on with the story. He made me reach lvl 50 [spoiler]before entering Junon for the first time[/spoiler] and it was crazy, I spent hours grinding there. I think I even cried because I was afraid he would catch me progressing without him knowing (???), but I was soooo bored at that point that I think I did it anyway. Now, everytime I play it, I grind a lot at the same spot lol.

Ok, talking about the actual port, this game had a graphic update from the PSX version. The character models, cities, items, etc. are cleaner, not pixelated I mean, but the 2D backgrounds are the same. It doesn't really bother me, since I just got used to it and didn't think about it anymore. 

The story is also pretty good, but I have to say that I am surprised I understood the story back then. I am Spanish, so I first played it in Spanish, and didn't really understand much because of the translation. Then I played it in English and everything made sense. Now, [b]I am playing it with The Reunion mod and the retranslation is [i]SO GOOD[/i] that it is like playing the game for the first time. The mod's translation is [u]REALLY GOOD[/u], everything is explained well and makes the OG translation a hot mess. I don't really know how I understood the back then, seriously.[/b]

I really encourage you to play it with the mod. You can even change it so it displays the PSX buttons instead of ""Press [ENTER] button"" for example.

I still don't know why people complained so much and saying it's not a good port? I play it with mods now, but still, when I didn't know about them, I really enjoyed it. Maybe I am biased because it's my favorite game... But I don't really think so. The game is playable and enjoyable! So [b]I definitely recommend it[/b], and if you have never played a Final Fantasy game before, check it out! It's worth it!!  

[b][u]OG review[/u][/b] 
I don't know why people are complaining so much about this port. I think it's good, I enjoy playing it. The only thing that is a little bit confusing to me is the buttons, I barely remember them by ""Press [OK] button"" or ""Press [SWITCH] button"" (dem minigames) since I just go by the PSX ones haha. 

Anyway, about being online, if you are not ""cheating"" you can turn off the cloud sync and just go with local files.",1460716635,1598268201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The graphics. Holy shit are they awful. Like seriously, so blocky and distracting and if I didn't love it so much I wouldn't even be able to play it and get past the shitty graphics.

2. Summons are so fucking long! They are beautiful, yes, even with shit graphics, but they get real tiresome after the 75th Knights of the Round.

3. As previously mentioned, the story makes zero sense. Yes, in broad strokes, there's supposed to be a pattern and such, but as you get to the details it is nonsensical. Yeah, the death scene was tragic and yeah I cried, fuck you I was young and had no idea and had raised that character as one of my powerhouses, but despite that the rest is just crap. Also that death still seems to have no reason behind it.

4. Angst. so much angst! So much sad drama angst. Am I who I think I am? Are any of us truly human? Just... let me hit things with my giant phallic sword.

This game has to be my favorite Final Fantasy the story is very engaging and delivers very impacting emotional scenes and events throughout the game. Most characters are very interesting and have there moments. The music is probably the best thing about this game it is so atmospheric and puts the mood just right, the boss themes are amazing especially near the end game. The Materia system can be a bit complicated but after you find out how to use it the combinations of effects and abilities you can get from them are endless. The down side of the game of course is how it looks being released in 1997 it looked good then but now it hasn't aged well but there are a variety of mods to make the game much better if your willing to do the work. The combat is turned based personal I don't mind turned based I find it very fun it can be very easy at some parts especially if you know what you are doing but can also be very difficult in certain parts of the game. The story in this game is amazing has some good twist and a good villain I don't want to ruin anything so that is all i'm going to say.

The feels. When I was kid my neighbor friend had a PS and i had a SNES and later an XBOX. I never owned a Playstation but from time to time we would go to each others house to play on each others console and talk games. So I had tried FF on his console a few times. One year my friend spent the entire summer off skool inside playing this game. I made fun of him for it because I had no one to play at the park with. Because of that, I hated Final Fantasy and Square Enix along with PlayStation. It was one of those child hood things that stuck with me. Now as an adult square Enix has produced some undeniably good modern titles. So all grudges aside I decide to give FF a try. I am so glad that I have had the opportunity to experience this game a decade and a half later. It is fantastic. the mix of retro pixel environments and 3d characters is really something. The music is great. Combat is perfectly balanced I had 8 health while dealing the final attack on the first boss. I guess this game takes a whole summer to play. With Cloud save you never lose your progress. So i can take as long as i need to catch up and experience FF7.",1594686297,1594687124,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

A couple things are clunky: navigation is harder than it needs to be (so interacting with objects can be tough), the key mapping is strange (and the xbox gamepad I use for every other game on windows doesn't work), and menu operations take more steps than they would today. But, most games released in the mid-90s (especially for consoles) show their age mechanically worse than that.

the translations haven't been fixed so you have to rely on mods because fan communities always care about the game more than the publishers do

 to even begin playing this you have to make an account with square enix
fucking gross

furthermore I tried to alt tab out of the game and my screen went black and I couldn't get out of it using ctrl+alt+del and had to restart my computer

you can't resize the game window after starting the game

and it pauses play when the game loses focus
so if you're tired of watching the fucking stupid 60 second long summon animations YOU BETTER HAVE A SECOND MONITOR

this is not a normal problem

also in the launcher there's a menu to change the controls for your controller but guess what it doesn't work. and it lists your controller buttons as button1, button2, button3, etc and I have no idea which button is which from that context

you see how before I've even begun play I've encountered 6 problems?
fucking ridiculous, these clown producers shouldn't be making money off this shit, which is another point against this, I doubt the devs or writers are getting royalties off these sales so why even buy it? you sure as shit aint supporting the people who made it

(Disclaimer: I played the game modded with 7th heaven 2.0 which is why there's only about a couple of hours of playtime in my steam account)

I was never really a big fan of Final Fantasy. The only game that i've played and finished through (besides FF7R) is FFXV, and lets just say that that game left a bitter taste in my mouth. Meanwhile, i've always heard the hype surrrounding FF7 for the better part of the decade now, and i've never really been personally interested in the game until i gave the recently released remake a try. The Remake, particularly its characters and story, hooked me right out of the gate which is why i then decided to just buy the OG game since the remake only covers the midgar portion. And while i dont like everything that this game offers, it's truly a piece of art and i can finally see the hype surrounding it. Even though alot of newer people will probably see this game as 'outdated', i highly suggest you try to stick with the game until the end.

[u]Pros[/u]
+ Story and Characters. While the base plot of the game isn't really that complex, its the story and characters that really resonated with me personally. The story does get pretty deep later on though which is why i highly suggest you go in the game blind. While some of the translation can get abit weird, There are ALOT of things in the story here that are really worth it to get through.
+ Music. Perfection. Do i really need to say anything else about the music? I mean cmon, it's a Final Fantasy score.
+ Combat. I'm not a big fan of turn based combat, but i was surprised by how still engaging and addictive the combat is even to a newcomer to the turn-based Final Fantasy. It's intuitive, easy to understand, and pretty enjoyable.
+ Content. Another thing that i almost forgot to mention, is the amount of content that this game offers. From minigames, to battle arenas, to sidequests, there are alot of things to do besides the main story, which just adds a whole lot more to the value of the overall package.

[u]Cons[/u]
- Random Encounters. While i enjoyed the combat, i cant say the same about the Random Encounters that start 90% of said combat. At first i didnt mind them, but around the mid-late game, i just straight up HATE its existence. It's a really annoying mechanic and i wish that this game had a system more in line with something like the Persona games. If there's one thing that i can say that's outdated about this game, then it would be this. I know there are alot of people who'd defend Random Encounters to death, but this is my personal opinion as someone who never really played the old Final Fantasy games, so i hope you'll get that.
- The Grinding. This is one other con that is also related to combat which i'm also not a big fan of. Around mid-late game, you are essentially required to grind and level up your characters to progress. While it's definitely possible progressing through the game without grinding, there are enemies that'll be able to just straight up one-shot you which just feels kinda cheap at times. Maybe it's just me that's not really used to these types of games yet, but it is just one other thing that i liked to note in my review since it annoyed me while i was playing the game.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
These are just the things that i listed from the top of my head about what i like and what i didnt like about the game. I didnt want to make this review to be very long as i want to make it abit more concise. But overall, my thoughts on Final Fantasy 7 as a 'Newcomer' is very positive. The hype surrounding this game IS real, and i highly recommend you to play this game if you're a fan of the new remake, or just looking for something to play in general. There are some caveats here and there that might make or break the experience of new players, but if you can get through them, its a damn good time for a game that was way ahead of its time.

But honestly, I just can't get behind the hype. First off, this just isn't a great port, having to make a square enix account and go through their launcher while staying online at all times. Granted, if that was the only problem I wouldn't be too upset, so I'll just put the rest of my complaints as a list.

1. Compared to other games from the same era, the graphics are atrocious. The difference between the roblox character models and the hand drawn backgrounds honestly made me nauseous. 
2. Party roles are not well defined. Perhaps others would like having flexibility, but when I look at Cloud, Tifa, and Barret I have no idea who the mage, damage dealer, tank, or healer is. 
3. Too many flipping characters. It's a problem in a lot of rpg's, but you've leveled your 3 characters every character after that is an extra. They'll inevitably be underleveled compared to your main party, and their strengths aren't well defined enough to justify changing.
4. The tone. The game starts out as a grim fantasy, but then it tries to be all happy and fun with crossdressing, Cait Sith, chocobo races. The shift is a bit jarring.
5. Lack of direction. After you lead Midgar you're left with very little idea what to do or why. You can kind of find the plot by wandering around for a bit, but it's more than a little tedious.

I'm sure someone else would like this game, but honestly it just doesn't live up to the hype. Hopefully I'll be happy when I get the chance to play the remake, but until then I'd just recommend FF9 for anyone who wants their fantasy jrpg fix.",1593363671,1593363671,False,2,2,0.438040345907211304,0,True,False,False

Having just replayed it again for the first time in many years, it still holds up to be incredibly fun and enjoyable. Still has amazing replay value. I used Yuffie for the first time ever in any of my runs, I wanted her to focus on high DEX and command materia. She actually did great by late game, Mug + Added cut = cheap way to get 2 attacks while leaving Double Cut for someone else, so with her high speed, she was able to pump out some decent damage for a non-Cloud's Ultima Weapon character. I also tried Vincent again, gave him tons of +MATK materia and W-Cast Mega-All Flare (Cheaper than Ultima for same 9999 damage). Good fun. For anyone wondering, it didn't seem like having Vincent in back row affected his melee attacks on his limit break, so I think they're long-range, not actually melee (I didn't use Long Range materia on him). Even with all the -STR from his materia, Chaos was still doing decent damage in final dungeon, so I think he's underrated and misunderstood in terms of usefulness.

What's to say about Final Fantasy VII that hasn't been said already? This game is truly a masterpiece. A masterpiece that, despite its graphics, has aged quite well. The beautiful thing is that since it's the PC version you can mod this game to hell and back. I decided to play the vanilla version for the achievements. I wanted to beat the game 100% and Steam achievements give me some sense of completion. This version of the game is excellent since it supports cloud saves. I was able to play on my desktop and then play on my Surface when I was on the road.
Now that there's a remake (of the first portion of the game), I feel that some might skip this version entirely which is sad. I decided to revisit this game because I was having trouble remembering the story details, and I'm happy to say that the story is even better than I remember. Give this game the opportunity to truly get its hooks in you and you won't regret it.
I've climbed the mountain. Typically when I beat a game in the fashion I did this one, I never touch it again. In my mind, I've truly completed it, like conquering a mountain. Well, I still have the remake, and I do own this game on multiple platforms like my PS4 and Nintendo Switch.

In other words, the game isn't actually saving my progress, and it's caused me to lose hours of gameplay multiple times.

Final Fantasy VII is ""my"" favourite game of all time and has had a massive impact on my life!!!
I got a loan of this from a friend who got a loan of it from a friend lol and I was instantly hooked from the opening cut scene!
Everything about this game is absolutely gorgeous!
The characters, stories, graphics (dated now I know), simplistic but strategic turn-based game play (which I love) and the MUSIC!!!
OMG the music is perfect!!
FF7 is classed as overrated by many but there is a really damn reason why people think that....it's just that good and has a MASSIVE following worldwide!
I've also played the demo for the remake of FF7 which I was really impressed with!
I wouldn't compare the two games, they are very different from each other and should be treated as such.
Comparing them is pointless.
My advice is enjoy BOTH games, not comparing them against each other.
Now, I will admit (and this will conclude my review) Final Fantasy VII on Steam is just ok.....
What I mean by that is, FF7 is and will always be best played on the original Playstation 1/PSX console.

As for my thoughts on FF7 in general, I played it years ago when it was still relatively new. However, much of its plot had been spoiled for me by friends, so I never felt like I got full experience it properly. I enjoyed it, and I considered it a great game. But there was just always something about it I never got that other people seemed to get. Something that made it truly one the greatest games of all time. In my recent playthrough, I finally got it. It's the relatability of the characters and the story. The characters spend the entire game trying to save the planet because it's the right thing to do. But there is a certain hopelessness to it. Everyone wonders if they can actually succeed. And, honestly, the game does a great job at making you think you won't succeed. It's the same thing in real life where we are always trying to do the right things but we get frustrated because everything feels hopeless sometimes. This time playing through the game, I really felt that in the characters, the story, and the setting in general. I won't be too specific in the interest of avoiding spoilers, but I definitely recommend playing this amazing game if you haven't before.
