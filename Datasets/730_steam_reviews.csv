If you choose to play on CS2s servers: regular comp matchmaking or premier, you can expect 1-3 sometimes even 5 cheaters in almost every game. there have been stretches of games that I have played where I have gotten matched against cheaters in every single game. at this point it feels rare to get into a game of regular comp or premier and not be playing either with or against someone whos cheating, usually against. The worst part about this is that these cheaters will play the entire game legit and then when they start losing a lot, they will just start cheating to win rounds. At this point there are no cheaters being banned in this game aside from a handful of manual ban waves and there is still no anticheat. In CSGO, there was always a cheating problem but at least there was overwatch and VAC did at least something but now, Valve has just released this ""new game"" with very little to no ""new content"" that doesn't directly make them money through micro-transactions and gambling. In fact, if you look at it as a whole, this game has so much less as a whole than the game it is a ""sequel"" to. In CSGO there were more maps, gamemodes, and anticheats as well as other features that dont fit into those categories and now in CS2, the only different thing is the graphics are better (and strain your PC if yours is dogshit) and the gun play mechanics are slightly different and somewhat broken. I grew up playing CSGO and it has been my favorite game to just chill and do something fun and mindless and now this game is completely unplayable because whats the point? Think about it from my perspective GABEN, I sit there for a whole 40 minutes of repetitive gameplay just to have our game tied at 11-11. Suddenly, some dude on the other team decides to turn on his ecolocation skills and mysteriously always knows where we are and my team loses 13-11 and I have basically just wasted an hour of my life because from the start, my team was never gonna win. All that I am left to do is to sit there in shame, embarrassed I just wasted that time on such a dogshit game and all I am able to do is right click their name, report them for cheating, cheating, and cheating and click submit and never know if anything ever happens. Right now tho, I know for a fact that nothing is happening and just as a little slap in the nuts, a kick in the shaft, GABEN decided to quietly update the report feature so instead of being able to report something for cheating, cheating, cheating, and griefing at the same time, you now can only report someone for one of these things at a time which is such a small little spitting of into our faces as a playerbase that I would actually be embarrassed if I worked on this tiny feature update. It wouldve been one thing if it had always been that way and they just intentionally never changed it but the fact that they removed a feature that added convenience to the player is fucking crazy.

Pretty self explanatory. Result of when people working with VALVE who were in charge of authoring this nonsense tried to put LEFT 4 DEAD 2 into Counter-Strike: Source and this was the result. Ruined the entire series as a whole and honestly safe to highlight Counter-Strike 2 will undoubtedly follow suite sadly. 

Should have never happened how it transpired. For a new impressionable self absorbed generation who are guilty of the exact thing they propagate. Don't be fooled, on the surface it is appealing due to it's easy access, but this is horrible experience right down to the inherent lie it is reflective of skillful interaction relevant to acquired PC it is being run on. Expect to be brutally executed by own ally right off the bat no delay, no question asked, no remorse, no noteworthy concequence. Honestly this is exactly the type of thing a person would deserve even trying it. Not sure which snow globe they were peering into for this, but it doesn't fit the criteria of a positive envelope. There is no fixing this disaster

Entry shooter nobody should care about. CS2 for short is a Counter-Strike title for the poor. Garbage, a burning dumpster fire. False sense of manifesting zero to nil talentless first person skill coupled with it is designed for people with severely disabled cognitive functioning. On the surface it seriously appears to be 100% legit the next best thing or iteration fueling the series, far cry in reality. 

Once the hard truth sets in, it is fully realized. Don't judge a book by it's cover. 

Only got a few hours of online queue interaction across a period of several years throughout it's developed cycle including it's content, however this is definately enough to suffice knowing it is pure and utter suffering even being a better opponent. Absolutely no ties to either Source or Counter-Strike which both do the style far better even to it's evolved now counterpart Counter-Strike 2 which only just hit the ground running to immediately crash and burn in direction. Everybody is a CT, because being the Terrorist faction is absolute suicide

Design looks ugly, despite being technically newer and the round announce audio is an abysmal nightmare. This is commonly marketed by budget vendor display tech as the ideal competitive benchmark, despite it does the TEAM-FORTRESS 2 inhereted cosmetic skin store worse, which shouldn't even be possible. Anything good they've incorporated such as the Scope Focus or the new playstyle is entirely weighed down by the fact it just isn't a very good experience. Only peg leg structural integrity support holding this continually collapsing skyscraper up is the weird crosshair which at this point is part of the appeal trickery. Movement is floaty, the shooting is weirdly all over the place except for the power weaponry which is even more blatantly in control of the entirety of every round which no question will lose in actual stakes. Pretty sure by now it's so concretely embedded into the community there is no will left to change it to a significant degree in which is desperately required to revive the series. No idea what they were thinking with this, as it hit an all time high of desperate attempt forced spoonfeeding. Queue up, to be ranked in a reoccurring, never ending, revolving door, spinning world rotating plane of land theory of predictable treachery with nothing to show for it except useless digital currency. Bullpup has a terrible 3D field of view scope, yet is worse than using the tried and true no scope crosshair increase previously seen. Tried to resurrect first iterations of player acceleration as if they were good or worth keeping, but scrapped animations, viewmodels, and formula. Source already had years of backlash for altering a few numbers of AK-47 output in relation to Armor Protection. Just pointing out now, if people are still being recommended this nonsense by a so called ally, should just hit the Block and Report button and never speak to them about anything ever again. Help people acknowledge how foolhardy they are for wasting their life trying. Don't forget to be the one who pulls the trigger first as fast as the nervous process will allow in relation to tick rate and latency vendor preference. Already forgot, nullified for the intended result, here let me help. Here, let me get that. Don't worry, got it. How was that?

VAVLE - CS2 - COUNTERSTRIKE 2
HELLO EVERYONE
i heard that ""new security thing added by Valve. After you change your name you have to wait 2-4 hours or something like that"" i cant trade because i changed MY NAME

But 75% of your server are ""WALL + AIM HACKING"" and u do nothing REPORT are only for pressing theirs are no action are taking against the hacker .

instead of wasting your time on trading and scammer improve your servers .

i got scammed with my knife , steam only banned the scammer from trade and the knife is getting back to steam !! another time if i got scammed i will not report the scammers let him have the item because u cant give it back so let him take it , it better than u take it.

and your market is very badly if i sell my item in low price to buy another item is low price , i cant buy it why !! i don't know why the money will be pending for 48 hours .

mak

With constant updates and smooth gameplay it is near the perfect online shooter. But lets start with the bad points, first of all the game is riddled with hacks which can ruin a ranked game as you are either forced to leave and accept a penalty or carry on playing through the practically unbeatable round. This is probably the worst aspect of the game other than this the fact that you have to now pay for gun customizations that are created by someone else is just terrible.

This said CSGO is one of the few games that has made E-sports what it is today, it is a fair game that you can just pick up and play (if you don't count hackers). And always leave you wanting just one more game.

Remembering ... Do not play the free version, as it is infested with cheaters.

If you are thinking about playing this game, quit thinking and do it! It doesn't cost a fortune and if you have dedication and are motivated to improve I'm sure you'll have an enjoyable time!

1. Introducing the zeus to it messed things up I think. It was always a lot of fun to run around with your knife out and annoy people by stealing their levels. getting a knife kill was often pretty challenging though and u really felt good when u managed to get one. now though, the zeus serves the same purpose and is insanely more effective, always one shots and has a much further range than the knife. With the bit of the new arms race ive played, the joy of having the whole lobby slowly descend into knife madness is gone. Everyone just goes zeus.

2. Needs more maps still! Shoots and baggage look very nice though. I'm sure they are just working on overhauling the old maps/making new ones. In the case of baggage it was completely overhauled.

3. The baggage overhaul is questionable to me. First off I love that the conveyor belts work now, and some things have been changed in a way I rather like. The tunnel in the center, the room at the bottom, good stuff. I hate the vent overhang over each spawn though. If the teams ever get unbalanced baggage just becomes a spawn killing mess. The more I've played it seems players are getting more used to it though, so maybe after some time it'll grow on me.

Improvements:
Improved graphics, new competitive ranking with premier game mode, weapon buy back at the start of the round, new smoke mechanics, map-based competitive ranking, and custom placement of weapon stickers.

Issues:
1. Cheating has never been worse, no overwatch system for community based bans.
2. Missing maps, game modes, commands, overwatch, and achievements.
3. Map based competitive ranking requires 10 matches per map which is ridiculous. A hybrid ranking system is needed to reduce the number of matches needed to rank.
4. North America region ranking is broken.",1416033226,1708749863,False,0,0,0.538461565971374512,2,True,False,False

Valve/Steam is making MORE items and skins to make MORE money than allocating employees to detect cheaters/spammers.
""Dave The Owner"" is becoming ""fatter"" than Kim Jong-un having so much money eating and eating... So much money not necessary to go public. Congrats dude.
Every single match there is at least one Chinese cheater/spammer (Even Korean w t h).
I know they are all BAD because good Chinese are already D**D.

3828 hours deeper into the game and i stand by my original statement.


The game is unplayable in it's current state.
Matchmaking is full of cheaters, so if u want to play this game you have to use a third party matchmaking service like Faceit. I am officially not playing MM til Valve has solved the problem.

Replacing CS:GO entirely and not allowing players to have CS:GO on their Steam library like 1.6 & Source.

Poor optimization, stutters, FPS drops and crashes. Bad performance on mid to low end gaming PCs.

No Mac Support, so Mac gamers who bought CS:GO can't even play.

Forcing everyone to play an unfinished version of CS2 that still feels like a beta.

Removing content from CS:GO like: maps like Cache, Train & Cobble, Danger Zone, Wargames, Workshop maps, community servers, no factions, missing commands...

Updated graphics: Some love 'em, some say they ruin the original aesthetic of the game and that it looks ""too cartoony"".

Broken skins, some players hate the new looks.

Overall dislike with the new ""subtick"" system which is mostly defined as a ""laggy, unpolished experience"" and a bunch of other nasty words you could read yourself by scrolling down the reviews.

Issues with lower ping users trying to kill high ping users and viceversa.

Game was shipped as a ""full release"" though it didn't bring anything new: no new cases, no new operation or gamemodes, no new cooperative missions, no new maps (asides from 3 reworks), no new anything. Players criticize that the ""full release"" is lackluster and barely adds anything new, in fact, it removes more features than adding anything.

Players are also mocking the new ""tutorial"" for being rather obsolete and not teaching enough to new players.

People compare it to Overwatch 2 and how mismanaged that game was by Activision-Blizzard-King, replacing Overwatch entirely and killing it's essence.

Overall people are unhappy because the game clearly needed more development time yet it was forced to release and replaced CS:GO entirely with rather less features and barely anything new.",1708717286,1708717286,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not only is there a substantial lack of anti-cheat measures, but also an astoundingly impotent level of support for it and the cheater problem that plagues it. Valve curbed the problem to a degree with Prime Status back in the day, but cheats are so advanced and easy to generate nowadays that it's basically spelling out the death of multiplayer gaming. 

I really couldn't express with words how disappointing it has been giving this game (and Valve) the benefit of the doubt, day in and day out. If I could refund my time, I certainly would. Don't waste your own time and sanity on this trash heap of an experience, because Faceit won't even save you.

Sure, the game itself is great, balanced, whatever, but like most other things in life, the company you keep (or rather, the company you're forced to be kept with, in this case) is far more important than the game itself. For me personally, it's generated one of the most lackluster and depressing experiences I've ever had the displeasure of having to go through, and that says a LOT.

-Game feels more stable, like no crashes when for example changing the resolution etc.
The game itself as well as the skins and stickers look great.

As a longtime fan of the Counter-Strike series, I couldn't wait to dive into Counter-Strike 2, and I can confidently say that it has exceeded all my expectations. Having played every iteration of the franchise since Counter-Strike Zero and Source, I can attest that Counter-Strike 2 is a true masterpiece and one of the best FPS games of all time.

What sets Counter-Strike 2 apart from its predecessors is its seamless blend of classic gameplay mechanics with modern enhancements. The core gameplay remains as addictive and exhilarating as ever, with intense firefights, strategic team play, and skill-based gunplay. From the iconic maps like Dust II and Mirage to the diverse selection of weapons and equipment, Counter-Strike 2 stays true to its roots while offering a fresh and immersive experience.

One of the most impressive aspects of Counter-Strike 2 is its attention to detail and polish. The graphics are stunning, with highly detailed environments, realistic weapon models, and smooth animations. Every map feels meticulously crafted, with strategic chokepoints, hidden corners, and destructible elements adding depth to the gameplay. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the series, the level of immersion in Counter-Strike 2 is unparalleled.

Another highlight of Counter-Strike 2 is its robust multiplayer experience. The matchmaking system is fast and reliable, ensuring that players are matched with opponents of similar skill levels for balanced and competitive matches. The inclusion of ranked modes adds an extra layer of challenge and incentive for players to improve their skills and climb the ranks. Additionally, the community features, such as custom game modes, server browser, and workshop support, provide endless opportunities for players to customize their experience and connect with other fans of the game.

As someone who has spent countless hours playing Counter-Strike over the years, I can confidently say that Counter-Strike 2 is a worthy successor to the franchise. It captures everything that made the series great while introducing new elements that keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. Whether you're a longtime fan like myself or a newcomer looking for an adrenaline-pumping FPS experience, Counter-Strike 2 delivers in every aspect.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike 2 is a must-play for any fan of the FPS genre. With its addictive gameplay, stunning visuals, and robust multiplayer features, it sets a new standard for excellence in gaming. I've been playing Counter-Strike for years, and I can say without a doubt that Counter-Strike 2 is one of the best games in the series and a testament to the enduring legacy of the franchise.",1708709031,1708709031,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

tl;dr This game is good, but if you sometimes find yourself not having fun (long after you learned the mechanics), I can understand.

This game has already relatively the same upsides CS:GO has, so I won't talk about things like the gunplay, the basic mechanics, weapons, maps etc. unless there are significant differences in my subjective opinion.

The biggest downgrade of this game is that you have to win 10 matches to get a rank in each map, as well as winning 10 premier matches to get your ELO score... It takes many months to do that, unless you have no life. This makes the game much less approachable and if you're a fan of CS who would like to get other people to get what is so good about it, it's gonna be challenging.

A significant difference that makes CS2 stand from the rest in the frachise is the stability... and not in a good way. I can't count the amount of times I saw a player get disconnected because of a server related issue (because of how many times it happened). Meanwhile, the amount of times that happened in previous CS games was, like, less than 5.
The movement and the player colision is also janky as heck. Sometimes you bump into players, and other times you go right through them.
The netcode in general feels like it requires 5G or something, it's the only way I can describe it based on how I've seen every player treated.

The 2nd worse thing this game has is probably the matchmaking. Every match feels like a gamble, in which you bet some of your time (approx. 40 mins) to see if you will have a fun match or not. I'm not saying that you need to win to have fun, but a lot of times I lost, it was a stomp and that is surely not fun, at least in the matches played before getting a map rank. Imagine getting shot in the head by a running enemy... and I thought the AWP was a disgrace (I hate all sorts of instakills).

You will NEVER feel the sense of pride or accomplishment by this game, it's a game made for you to sink your time in, and you will never feel rewarded or fullfilled by (just) that. It theoretically should not be your goal, as a player. This game's true progress is ranking up, but that's only if this is what you aim for. As for me, I just wanna have fun each time I play, which is unfortunately not certain, mostly due to the matchmaking and/or the smurfs.
This game's matchmaking pool is a sea, with fish that are smaller and bigger than you, you just have to bet every time you queue which fish you play with & against. Premier, Comp and Wingman are just straight up you gambling your free time. It's still... relatively... worth it for the social experience, although the same applied to CS:GO too and I don't see a reason why CS2 is better yet.
I'm sure Valve works to make the game better in regards to servers, but with matchmaking, I'm not so sure...



CS:GO REVIEW
tl;dr This game is almost perfect. It's all fun and games until you die from an AWP shot too many times
I recommend playing in lower ranks only.

This game does a lot of important things right... and just a few things wrong.

In competitive, the only way to have fun is to win, because this game is NOT one of those that is fun enough to enjoy it even when you lose, unless you trick yourself into doing that (like me). In order to win, the key is to become at least average with the mechanical skill this game requires, but the most basic way to do that is to shoot only when you're still. Unfortunately, this means that Run & Gun is rarely a viable tactic (unless you're using an SMG in lower ranks). Camping is encouraged to a discusting degree, as well as headshots. Head is the only thing the enemies aim at (especially in average/high ranks, which is reasonable) and I just wish this didn't happen to such frustrating extent. When you die, chances are, the kill feed will mention it was a headshot. Lastly, spread is the reason you will most likely miss your shots. Even when you fire a pistol, if you use the firerate to its full degree, that will be the reason your shots didn't go where you expected them too. I wish this wasn't the case for a lot of pistols but here we are.

Unlike most, I simply enjoy the content the game has to offer, the guns, the maps, the modes and the social interaction (that may happen once in a while), which makes it sad for me that the only mode that is mostly getting attention by bot the devs and the players is competitive. Literally everyone plays competitively. Worst than that, people always tend to pick maps based on how well they know them, which means that new or fun maps can hardly become permanent additions. Heck, most maps that have been permanently added are maps that cater more to the try-hards. 
Not to mention, any other mode other than Competitive hardly gets updated, because people just don't care about fun apparently and all they want is Source 2 (fair enough), 128 tick servers and better anti-cheat. Like, I get it, 2/3 of these are important and reasonable to ask, but I believe there are other stuff worth mentioning too. Casual and other fun game modes are neglected. Competitive will never ""die"" because ranks are the reason people play this game, which is sad to see. There are game modes I wish had official matchmaking queues, like Fight Yard.

Talking about maps, this game used to be good at adding maps, until you become attached to a map, only for Valve to take it away from the official matchmaking. Multiple maps, like Santorini, Season, Tulip and Coast have been in and out of the game, sadly.

The AWP is getting it's own paragraph. Why? Because it's that awful to see an AWP in a match, especially if it's user is a skilled one. A sniper that can insta-kill if it shoots the head or the body? So, if you like getting eliminated, just because someone on the enemy team decided to save 4500$+, this is a game for you. No matter how good you are, you can't prevent an enemy from saving $. Insta-kill guns aren't fun to play against and despite being someone who has been a CS fan since 1.6, I can understand any newcomer's frustration on the AWP. I can tolerate CS:GO's AWP, but that's partially thanks to the fact that I don't see it that often, as well as it's mag capacity.

I would normally not recommend this game, at least until Valve added enough classic maps back in the game, and hopefully made proper changes to make the fun modes even better, and give players incentive to play a mode that isn't associated with a ranking system. However, an important reason why I easily choose this game over others is because of the massive amount of players in Competitive and the social interaction that comes with it, since people use voice chat, as well as the solid movement and shooting mechanics, which simply can't be found in other games and is too good to pass up. Despite this game not being a masterpiece, it is one of the best games out there, far better than most. Heck, the Source engine by itself is one of the best things that happened to the gaming industry.",1530172469,1708706520,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Since CS:GO, I have a love-hate relationship with this game, kinda toxic.

You see, I'm an aging millennial, so I play this FPS game because it's the only one I know how to play for PC, and I'm too busy to learn a new one.

Nowadays this game got a bunch of new stuff, flashy interface, I believe Valve tweaks it to appeal to the new generation, understandable. Still, kinda feel over-complicated, but I got used to it.

As a positive point, last few months the cheaters decreased A LOT. 
This game was UNPLAYABLE for most of 2022/23, it's way better now. Thanks Valve.

Few points I believe it would make this game MUCH BETTER:

> I'm frustrated with the fact I can't customize my character inside the game, and it looks like I need to pay for it anyway. But it would be SUPER COOL if I could actually earn points from winning the game to exchange for those custom things, or use the Steam points for it.

> I've never paid anything on this game because I kinda grandfathered Premier/Prime mode, which I never used because I'm too old for the audio chatting and teamwork involved with the classic game mode, and it's too slow for me. So if I could ask something from Valve, it would be Arms Race and Deathmatch ranked...

> I'm playing this game for 20 years, so I'm here for the adrenaline rush and dopamine fix lol
So if they had fy_ , aim_ , and awp_ maps on matchmaking that would be my dream.

> Lastly, if I could filter somehow a ""game mode"", like ""play with casual people that just came back from work"" instead of always matching with the ""energy-drink-fueled kid that plays this game 18 hours a day"", the game would be more enjoyable and balanced.",1708702547,1708702547,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

730,78410353,76561198271919148,0,57,18698,0,18698,1706553500,"I thought better of Valve than to think they would ever sink to Blizzards level and do a Overwatch 2 with their most loved title when they did much better with how they handled the Left 4 Dead series (even if L4D2 is theoretically superior to the first game in every way, they still kept the first one for the ones interested)
I'd love to return that model when ""ending support"" or ""making a sequel"" (both of which is perfectly natural for any developer), didn't automatically mean killing the game permanently because you're afraid it would compete with the remake.

This is not comming from me expecting permanent support. I would be totally fine if they never updated/promoted GO again, shut down all its servers (the game had perfect bot implementation and peer 2 peer hosting anyway) and moved the owned skins to a separate game (or made more valueable skins exclusvie to CS2) for those players who only played for the economy. The game was future proof until its mother betrayed it.
It never needed the facelift as CSGO looked better than most CoD games comming out 10 years after it. True artistic skill is making a game look amazing on a outdated engine with a timeless artstyle rather than spamming a bunch of GFX.

Even if CS2 might eventually be a great (or even better) game again in 10 years time, that defeats the entire purpose of making a ""sequel"" in the first place if youre just gonna break the foundation to get back where you were instead of just leaving it alone and moving on.
Just calling it ""Counter Strike 2"" makes no sense since that overlooks Condition Zero, Online and Source and if they refer to it being the sequel to GO then it makes no sense either since there now is no CS1.

Even the trailer is more soulless and pay no attention to the action, risk and thrill of CS and only highlights that ""this is the new E sport money cow because we said so"". 
A cinematic reimagening of playing a round on Nuke is replaced with a (incomplete) roadmap of features, a narrator pretending to care about history (when the game the trailer represents killed history) and a light hearted and colourfull ad that feels indifferent from any mobile game or toy commercial.

I must admit there are some few and small welcomed features (volumetric smoke is next to destructable environments the most mindblowing tech i never thought would ever be possible in games), but most of them dont even need Source 2 (like seeing your own legs or having honest crosshairs) or are swimming in a pile of garbage like annoying bloom/oversaturated lighting that makes Dust 2 look like a nuclear bomb has gone off (before the Terrorists even bought grenades) or make cs_italy dark and brownish in a ugly Fortnite colour scheme. The worst offender being the trolly HUD that blurred and opaqued the minimap so its harder to read & switched the positions of health and money just to be a jerk. (If it aint broke dont fix it! Change is only good if its a nessecary step for objective improvement!)
The game has also gotten harder to run. So much for accessibility in a even and competitive game. Wasnt much of a issue for me but i can imagen it will alienate a majority of the low end users or competitive players who thougt 120 frames on de_engage was too slow.

This is just disrespectful to any modder/mapper that has poured years of their life making content for this game or to anyone who values game preservation. The only reason i liked to play GO in the first place was the history behind it and the ocean of community crafted maps that are now incompatible and stuck in the trash bin.

RIP CSGO. I never liked you but i didnt want you to die for a bloddy VR engine in a irreversable update that only removed 10 years worth of content & polish and replaced them with new bugs and a game without legacy.
Unless there is a standalone mod that uses the last (good version) of the CSGO engine where i can pull my maps to im never playing this again. I refuse to update it or even aknowledge CS2 untill some modder or archiver provides a alternative. But i guess im the only person who cares about this and this was what the community (who probably just didnt want to admitt they hated spread or blame lack of skill on hit reg) wanted all along.
This is the second time Source 2 stole a game from me first by making the first half life game in 15 years VR exclusive and now by forcing me a ""update"" that i never asked or hoped for.

This is NOT a sequel but just the same game but with less than what we had before:
1. Less content (workshop maps and permanent alternative gamemodes like DZ removed)
2. Less polish. (Studdery movement, tilting glitch, exploits)
3. Less artistic dignity. (Gotta ruin player visibility and framerate by polluting the artstyle with expensive motion blur, screen tinting, bloom and lensflares. Its not like the rotten source engine is popular to this day just because it lacked annoying effects like this)
4. Less legacy. This is not the game i met my awesome friends in and not the same game i watched content creators grow in.
5. Less trust in valve to preserve their titles you paid for.
6. Less respect for the player.",1604079871,1708679930,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I've been playing CS since the 1.6 and Source days ‚Äì over 1,200 hours logged between the two. The raw gameplay, the gritty maps, the incredible community mods ‚Äì that was CS.  CS:GO was already a step in the wrong direction, and CS2 feels like they kicked the franchise while it was down.

Where's the modding soul? No custom maps, no crazy community servers? CS used to be a playground for creativity, now it's a sterile corporate product.

Microtransactions killed the vibe: Paying for weapon skins that used to be FREE community creations? Paying for map packs that would've been awesome workshop additions? It's insulting.

Gameplay feels... off: I can't put my finger on it, but the movement, the gunplay, it doesn't have that classic CS tightness. Like they tried to copy the ""modern shooter"" feel and ruined the formula.

No respect for the legacy: Where's the respect for the iconic maps, the old-school game modes, the history of this series? Feels like they just want to milk a familiar name.

Bottom Line:  If you loved the old-school CS, this ain't it. It's a soulless, cash-grabbing imitation that misses the whole point of what made Counter-Strike special.",1708637696,1708637696,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Valve should be ashamed.
I can't stop playing, i'm addicted, if I kill myself it will be thanks to this garbage game.

pros
The game looks great! don't get me wrong it looks really fucking good
maps looks great and matchmaking is okay
the guns looks fucking awesome!
Sub Tick is okay
cons
the game crashes don't matter what settings you are running on could be low - very high graphics and still crashes for no reason including in game when throwing a utility or even shooting crashes EVEN MOVING AROUND CRASHES THE GAME
movement is ass (i love csgo movement way better)
rife and smg hit reg is god awful it's really bad i can't even hit my shots when i have my crosshair on the person
sub tick is probably the worst thing they could ever introduce I've seen people run into cover and they still get headshotted behind cover or even shooting someone with an awp when you should got a kill but no you die instead. 
D sync is really bad to same goes for sub tick.
IP Exploit I will not say anything further

but yeah i would not recommend playing this game at it's current stage honestly valve should of waited at least a year or two of releasing cs2 instead of doing it last month and leave csgo discontinued next year which is awful and really bad decision on valve.

anyway that is my opinion and i will stand by it so hope you have a nice lovely day",1623983057,1708590156,False,0,0,0.464150935411453247,0,True,False,False

[i]Let's start at the beginning![/i]

[b]What can we expect from this game?[/b]


[i]Fun, hours of gameplay, raids and new friendships. This game was made for people who like to challenge themselves and others. Its gameplay is not at all easy for people who are just starting to play CS:GO. You would need to spend a long time training to be able to do something useful in your team. However, even if you find it difficult at first, it may surprise you after a while.[/i]

[b]Does this game have a toxic community?[/b]


[i]And what game doesn't? Of course, for the most part the community isn't toxic, but it is toxic in a way. Sometimes you'll come across people who swear at you for no reason, or make fun of your nickname because they don't like it, or simply because you're gay or, in the minority, because you're a woman. Of course, this isn't generalized, it happens sometimes. I'm not here to rubbish the community, as I've seen it happen to other people and to myself in some matches.[/i]

[B]Is this a good game to pass the time?[/b]

[i]Yes, it is. Even though the style of play may seem cloying after a while, it won't let you down. There are several modes you can play with your friends, as well as competitive modes which, as the name implies, are for competing with other players. So you'd have plenty of things to do solo, as well as with your friends![/i]

[b]Does this game have a lot of hackers in it?[/b]

[i]Well, so far I haven't found any hackers in the games, but from what people in the community have been saying, there are some hackers in the game. This is because the game has recently become a free game, so because of this, many people who previously didn't want to hack the game because it was a paid game are now free to get in and strike terror in the game.[/i] 

[B]Is CS:GO Anti-cheat any good?[/b]

[i]As far as I can see, it is. It's made by valve itself, the creator of Steam. So, because it's from Steam, I think they take a harder line against the hacker community that exists within games.[/i]

[b]My rating for this game?[/b]

[i] I give it a 9.2. It's not perfect, but it's not so bad that it's unplayable. However, it's a lot of fun, you can make a lot of friends, among other things.[/i]",1606726753,1708574739,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is getting worse with every update. Now it keeps crashing continuously. Another proof that the original Valve developers are gone, and those who are currently there are not incompetent.


# Update 2024.02.01.
-------------------------------
Almost half a year after CS2 released and still full of bugs. Broken and retarded matchmaking system, missing contents, and lots, lots of cheaters. Seriously, CS2 have the most cheaters out of all CS games. What happened Valve??? 
Shame.


Counter Strike 2 right now is flaw, janky, incomplete, half-finished. It would have needed several more months or years to optimize and improve. And on top of that [b]ALL previous CS:GO progress, for which the player invested a lot of time and energy, has completely disappeared!?! [/b] CS2 should have been a separate game. It should have let the players to choose which game they prefer not force them! This is unaccaptable!


- CS:GO achievements are gone!
- Downloaded demos are gone
- Hardly earned ranks are gone
- [strike]No workshop (yet)[/strike]
- The new buy-menu system is horrible and limited
- Graphics still looks 15 years old
- Sluggish feeling
- Slower gameplay
- Missing maps
- Missing game modes
- Tick issues
- Physics are slightly worse now
- [strike]If someone leaves the game in the first couple of rounds, the match will automatically end with a loss for your team!!![/strike]
- You have to grind your rank up from 0
- The new UI trying to copy modern games, but its a very cheesy attempt and totally not fitting 
  for CS.
- The whole game feels cheap and beta right now

+ Slightly better graphics
+ New smoke. yay!


Sadly, Counter Strike is starting to lose its identity and slowly becoming a Fortnite game.

Valve do nothing against hacker because it's a easy way to get more money of the stupid community.

Introduction:
Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) marks the latest chapter in the storied Counter-Strike franchise, which has captivated gamers for decades. To fully appreciate the significance of CS2, we must first traverse the historical landscapes of its predecessors, including the groundbreaking Counter-Strike 1.6 (CS 1.6), the transitional Counter-Strike: Source (CSS), and the widely acclaimed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). This comprehensive review delves into the intricate details of the Counter-Strike series, exploring its rich esports history, the allure of virtual skins, the evolution of operations, and the impact of map design on the gaming experience.

Counter-Strike 1.6: The Foundation of a Legacy:
CS 1.6 laid the foundation for the Counter-Strike phenomenon, emerging as a mod for Half-Life in 1999. Its tactical gameplay and tight gun mechanics quickly garnered a massive following, establishing the game as a mainstay in competitive multiplayer gaming. The grassroots esports scene began to flourish around 1.6, creating the blueprint for future iterations.

Counter-Strike: Source - A Transitional Phase:
Counter-Strike: Source, released in 2004, aimed to modernize the series with a new engine and enhanced graphics. While it faced initial skepticism from the dedicated 1.6 community, Source introduced dynamic physics and improved visuals, paving the way for the aesthetic upgrades seen in subsequent titles. The transition was not without controversy, but Source's impact on the series cannot be overlooked.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - A Resounding Success:
CS:GO, launched in 2012, was a critical turning point for the franchise. The game maintained the core mechanics of its predecessors while introducing updated graphics, new maps, and innovative gameplay features. CS:GO not only revitalized the series but also elevated Counter-Strike to unprecedented heights, becoming a cornerstone of the esports landscape.

Esports Evolution: Counter-Strike's Competitive Legacy:
The Counter-Strike series has been synonymous with esports since its inception. From local LAN tournaments during the 1.6 era to the global spectacle of CS:GO Majors, competitive Counter-Strike has evolved significantly. CS2 continues this tradition, building on the foundation of its predecessors to offer a competitive experience that resonates with both casual players and seasoned professionals.

Skins: Virtual Aesthetics and In-Game Economy:
CS:GO revolutionized in-game customization with the introduction of weapon skins. These virtual cosmetics not only added a layer of personalization but also created a thriving economy centered around skin trading and marketplaces. CS2 expands on this concept, introducing new, meticulously designed skins that add a fresh dimension to the virtual arsenal.

Operations in CS:GO: Dynamic Content Delivery:
CS:GO's Operations introduced a dynamic aspect to the gameplay experience. These time-limited events brought new maps, missions, and challenges, creating a cyclical pattern of engagement for players. CS2 continues this tradition, promising a stream of fresh content and keeping the player base invested in the evolving narrative of the game.

The Tapestry of Maps: A Crucial Canvas in Counter-Strike:
Maps have always been a cornerstone of Counter-Strike's success. From the iconic Dust II in 1.6 to the intricate layouts of CS:GO's Overpass and Mirage, each map has shaped the competitive landscape. CS2 inherits this legacy, introducing new battlegrounds that challenge players and foster strategic depth, ensuring that the dynamic nature of Counter-Strike persists.

Counter-Strike 2: The Next Chapter Unveiled:
CS2 emerges as the culmination of years of development, learning from the strengths of its predecessors. Building upon the legacy of 1.6, Source, and CS:GO, CS2 promises a refined gaming experience that caters to the diverse tastes of Counter-Strike enthusiasts. The anticipation surrounding CS2 is palpable, with the community eager to witness the next evolution in the series.

CS2 Esports: A Continuation of Legacy:
The esports scene surrounding CS2 is already taking shape, with tournaments and leagues adapting to the new title. The competitive integrity and strategic depth that define Counter-Strike are expected to thrive in CS2, ensuring that the game remains a linchpin in the global esports ecosystem.

Innovations in Skins: CS2's Aesthetic Frontier:
CS2 introduces an array of innovative skins, showcasing the evolution of virtual aesthetics. Collaborations between developers and the community result in unique designs that reflect the player base's preferences. The virtual skin market in CS2 is expected to further elevate the in-game customization experience, providing players with an expansive palette for personal expression.

Dynamic Operations in CS2: A Constant Evolution:
CS2 embraces the tradition of operations, introducing dynamic content that keeps the gaming experience fresh. These operations not only bring new challenges and maps but also serve as a testament to the developers' commitment to ongoing player engagement. CS2's operations promise a continually evolving landscape for players to explore and conquer.

Map Diversity in CS2: Balancing Tradition and Innovation:
CS2's map design strikes a delicate balance, incorporating beloved classics while introducing innovative battlegrounds. The goal is to create a map pool that caters to various playstyles, ensuring that CS2 remains accessible to both veterans and newcomers alike. The diverse range of maps in CS2 promises to be a key factor in sustaining the game's longevity.

CS2's Future: A Promising Horizon:
As Counter-Strike 2 unfolds, the future of the franchise appears promising. Ongoing support, potential expansions, and continued engagement with the esports community hint at a dynamic future for CS2. The developers' commitment to innovation and responsiveness to player feedback positions CS2 as a frontrunner in the ever-evolving landscape of competitive gaming.

Conclusion: CS2 - An Evolving Masterpiece:
Counter-Strike 2 encapsulates the essence of its predecessors while pushing the boundaries of what Counter-Strike can achieve. From the historical significance of 1.6 to the transitional phase of Source and the resounding success of CS:GO, CS2 emerges as a culmination of the series' rich legacy. With its commitment to esports, virtual customization, dynamic operations, and map diversity, CS2 stands poised to become a timeless masterpiece, ensuring that Counter-Strike remains a dominant force in the gaming world.",1695919939,1708505806,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Surfing used to be an integral part of the way I enjoy this game. And these days there are only a few maps that are even enjoyable.

These ramp bugs are like so, you'll be surfing and all of a sudden you just stop moving. It's like the game just hitches, or your feet glitch into the ground. Idk but it's infuriating because it's random.

I can run the same map 100 times, the same exact way, and only get through 5 times because at some point. On the same exact path, the game bugs and I go flying off of the ramp with a random trajectory.

how am I supposed to grind with +100 / -800 after that ?

I won't even spend my time writing an useful comment for a game that doesn't deserve it.

However, it is still missing key (casual) maps like de_cobblestone, bots have no difficulty setting (while it's not in the GUI, the console command exists, but doesn't work ._.), and the anti-cheat is still pretty crap. 

[hr][/hr] 
28/09/23 Update: I'm disappointed in Valve. First of all, you can no longer play CS:GO. Why? Why didn't you just release it as a new app? People still play CS:Source, so why not let us play CS:GO easily? You wiped things such as achievements from CS:GO in the process and it's just disappointing to see from a company as beloved as Valve. I'm guessing it'll be they wanted to keep skins and they wanted to keep the 1.6 million or something existing CS:GO reviews. The reason this annoys me so much is because CS2 isn't ready. It's buggy and still missing key features such as the workshop, the other game modes like arms race and danger zone as well as major maps that are used in professional tournaments like de_cache and de_train. This isn't even touching on the sub-tick shooting animation issues, where the animation has to wait till the next tick instead of happening at a sub-tick level for some reason? The whole game feels underwhelming for something that is supposed to be an upgrade from CS:GO. I didn't even touch on the terrible frame rate I'm getting, seriously, 80fps at 1080p medium on an RTX 3060? Bit of a joke. They should've taken Valve time, it's perfectly fine to delay the release of a game if it isn't ready.

-Russians + former members of the USSR: People without any type of remorse, focused on squeezing this game as much as they could for their lives, all of them with more than 3000 hours in the game but quoted less than 10.

-Central Europeans + Scandinavians: Calm and polite people who simply want to play and have a good time without neglecting their high competitive level.

-French: People? The only thing they seek is to win in the most disgusting and vile way possible, not to mention their beautiful language, which is as if when you speak you are vomiting after drinking 3 bottles of expired absinthe.

-Portuguese: Real textbook cretins, at first they seem calm but as soon as you ignore them in a round they proceed to rant about you in their native language at a speed as if it were a YouTube video at x3, their body odor which is scarce is sneaks through their microphones.

-Spanish: Literally the mixture of all the above, depending on the autonomous community in which they reside, they present different features such as:
The Andalusians do not know how to speak and are very heavy in the entire meaning of the adjective.
Gallegos, chaos and animals can be heard in the background.

The anticheat system provided by ""valve"" is so bad that many players switch to third party servers such as ""faceit.com"" because they have significantly fewer or no cheaters.
In addition, it would be better to replace a player who has left the game with another player in order to compensate for the resulting disadvantage for the team, instead of letting the team play with one less player.

All in all you can love the game but hate it at the same time.
In my opinion, fixing the critique mentioned above would lead to a better gaming experience and fun.

With the determination of a CT guarding the bomb site and the precision of a T executing a well-coordinated rush, I scoured every corner of the virtual battlegrounds in hopes of uncovering pixels stripped of their digital garments.

Yet, like a failed rush against a fortified defense, my efforts yielded no fruit. No matter how many crates I opened or how many custom servers I explored, the promise of nudity remained out of reach.

However, amidst the disappointment, I discovered something far more valuable: the sense of camaraderie shared among players, the exhilaration of clutching a round in the face of adversity, and the sheer joy of immersion in the vibrant CS:GO community.

While the game may lack in pixelated nudity, it more than compensates with the thrill of competition and the bonds formed through teamwork and shared experiences.

However, despite it's enduring popularity; I personally do not enjoy the game. Let me explain.

The gameplay loop basically boils down to buying weapons and going into shootouts against an enemy team.
All of this takes place in a limited pool of maps - which are very much static and small.
You compete for virtual ranks that are designed to display your skill level in the game to others. You can also go for collecting skins for your weapons - though they are mostly random drops.
Unfortunately, toxic teammates that take the game way too seriously along with occasional cheaters take a lot away from the experience.
However, if you have a few friends that play the game casually every now and then - it can still be enjoyable.

This is a competitive game. Sometimes new maps are added and older maps are reworked or removed. But apart from some visual changes and some weapon balances, the game plays out pretty much the same as it did when it was first released in 2012.
Though, I do enjoy some of the changes. The HRTF sound system update, the Negev change and recently the changes brought in with Source 2 update are all nice changes that changed the game for the better in my opinion.",1485890648,1708392818,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Looked even promising beginning for Counter-Strike's new installment. Except it slooowly over the years became the biggest cash cow and gambling addiction den you can ever witness and that's what it hurts the most to the core. Game itself is a self working Betsy that has had enough of such torture but still kicking, whilst every patch comes out making the game more and more unstable. Genuine was more fun than it used to be without skins but even with first batch of skins added it, it wasn't hurting anyone. But now... now the game is in a messed up state where you have tons of bugs and glitches- not to mention clippings.
There are bots and cheaters even trading bots everywhere filled with scamming pollution than your average Chinese powerplant workers. Not to mention people keep loving this game saying there's nothing wrong with it with the most delusional intellect of a mindset you can gaze upon other than knowing everything is a pile of hot junk here and there.
Did I mention every gun audio in this game sounds like a NERF toy gun? Or did I even mention the Overwatch system to let players see and find cheaters is also not very fond of you trying to VAC ban users? Aka people will still be hiding their cheats or ways of doing to undo their filth. Not to mention there ARE folks who occasionally are going to witness Overwatch footage and let cheaters have their angel wings and the host watching the footage is one filth himself.

I cannot fathom how I wish to go few years back and enjoy this game again. I'm also more terrified to even trying this game without Overwatch system falsely accusing me having cheats by playing the game because it can be exploitable in the wrongest hands. This may sound like an over exaggeration but there are already fewest examples spreading upon. Besides, I cannot enjoy this game knowing that even hitregs or weirdest spray patterns exist and you would question your mental health if a shot landed or not. Again there's lots of things in this game wrong and I wish it wasn't the case...

1-unlike csgo, cs2 doesnt have movement. You cannot do any bhops or it's not satisfying at all

2-fps. Oh yeah, while I was getting 200+ in csgo, I barely can see 100 fps. It is generally between 60-80 fps

3-cheaters, Valve is doing nothing about it and this is why you are playing every match finding yourself thinking if somebody in the enemy team is cheating.

4- Crashes. There are tons of crashes in the game. Sometimes game says ""vac can't verify game session""so you have to check integrity if you are having that problem. Also sometimes when you are trying to accept the match you see like nobody has accepted the game. But somehow after the countdown game says ""you didn't accep the match in time"" soooo now you have to restart your game .ddd. No we are not done yet.
Game literally is breaking my internet in every 5 minutes or maybe even less. Game sends me back to lobby and my whole internet is being gone for this game. Even in discord or any other app you can imagine, they basically are losing the connection because of I am playing cs2.

Trust me and don't play this game. I don't have even one good thing to say about cs2. Game is just releasing new update and they are just fixing the geometric issues or other unimportant stuff.

cs2 is unfinished game and apparently, valve doesn't aim to make the game better and more playable.

- New dealt damage stats are visible only for about 5 seconds and only displayed after round ends, if you lucky enough to catch it as you might be watch something else while dead

- There is absolutely no way to track who hit you first, who last and who in between with the newly introduced dealt damage system

- You won't know the damage taken was done with what weapon. You just cannot know that no more.

- You will only get a summary of damage dealt at the end of round under enemy avatars, again for about 5 seconds

- It is very difficult to tell by avatar, who hit you from the players table (When pressing TAB). You have to scan by eye the entire players list, then find their avatar to associate with their name. It is so CONFUSING!!

- It sucks you can't develop any strategy based on above. At least I used to for the past 20+ years. I know, I am old, I grew up with this game. I also grew up with Atari. That was fun!

- Totally unacceptable for Valve to delete CS:GO and shove this garbage in our throats

- I always play with the XM1014 (Auto-Shotgun) the new one in CS2 sounds like a pistol, really Valve? You gonna do me like that. Is like one driving a ferrari but its exhaust system sounds like a little Honda Civic. 

- I actually paid close to $15.00 for CS:GO. Since the game is not in my library anymore, I feel robbed (I actually do). Sorry I did not asked to be updated to CS2. At least valve should return my money

- Smells like lawsuit to me. I mean, this should be illegal to take something away from you after one paid for it.

- Game has some performance issues, it has closed out on me on a few occasions. Never happened before with CS:GO


CONCLUSION:
-  I have been playing CS2 for few months now, I just can't get used to this dealt damage stats. I can't. It is plain stupid. I miss dealt damage in console feature every time I play.

Edit; 19-02-2024:

Honest opinion - Play valorant. Atleast they give a sh*t.

I just sat through 5 premier mm lobbies with cheaters. 3 of the lobbies were 5 man premade aswell. Because so few bans are going out that people feel confident to just cheat as 5 mans. It's an absolute joke.

I saved dusins of these cheaters steam ID's from over a month and not a single cheater I have played against have recieved a VAC ban yet, as of writing this. 

The integrity of the game is gone. 
Not to mention the overall lack of content and IMHO the game just feels like it's still in Beta.

Spray is ruined, A-D tactic (shooting while pressing A-D) won't work anymore, even the AWP, which was the only gun I believe I had some skill with, doesn't seem to work. 

Premier is a bad idea. Why would I compete for a place on a stupid top. Other than that, premier is full of cheaters. Half of the top are cheating and the anti-cheat is worst than it was on CS:GO (I never thought that can happen). Competitive still exists but now you have a different rank for every map, which ruins the whole point of it. Why would I wanna be silver on Dust and Global on Mirage? I WANNA BE GLOBAL EVERYWHERE IF I'M GLOBAL RIGHT? Oh btw, there isn't a single player that is ranked higher than Legendary Eagle Master when I'm writing this. They ruined it so bad.

Every bugfix spawns 5 more ridiculous bugs and it feels like Valve don't have a QA team working on this game at this point. The latest ridiculous bug is now kicking players from competitive games for 'teamkilling' when they're really killing the enemy players. It sounds made up but this is a real bug. Unfortunately it's just one of many introduced in the latest patch. Other gems include grenades sticking in thin air and extreme lag when scoping. All this in a minor patch! You can only begin to imagine how many 'features' they cram into the major patches,

The ranking system is borderline unplayable, if you try to queue with mixed elo friend groups the outliers will get shafted as the ranking system will essentially try very hard to equalise everyone to the same rating over time. Similarly bad players will obtain astronomical ratings by playing with 4 friends. In a game where no one's rating even remotely reflects their skill, good luck finding balanced matches. Not to mention that since the game is still horribly unstable you're going to be playing a decent number of matches 4v5 as your teammates will crash out the game and occasionally not be allowed to reconnect to the server.

After losing 4 matches in a single sitting to having teammates who are AFK, teamkilling, crashing repeatedly, being kicked for ""teamkilling"" when not actually teamkilling, or a combination of these, I've decided not to waste anymore of my time on this game and have uninstalled, gg volvo. Maybe catch you for CS3 but I doubt it.

game mid, better with friends, server browser kinda broken though
10/16/23
CS2 is out, server browser still doesnt work, find a way to keep my game open when the non working server browser comes up
thats about it, game mid
1/1/2024
CS2 Browser works. my game constantly crashes on casual dms, if you dont play casual at all its whatever. too many bad players throwing out hackusations and ruining everybody's game. if you can put up with it or know how to hit mute it isnt too bad. it's mainly that there's always one or two people in the game doing it

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

As a longtime fan of the original CS game, I was eagerly anticipating CS2. However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment upon playing it.

Firstly, the graphics are a massive step backward. While the original CS had a gritty and immersive aesthetic, CS2 feels like a cheap knockoff with bland textures and uninspired character designs. It's as if the developers put no effort into updating the visuals for a modern audience.

The gameplay mechanics are also lackluster. Controls are clunky and unresponsive, making it frustrating to navigate the game world. The AI of enemies is laughably bad, often standing still or running into walls instead of posing any real challenge. It's clear that little thought went into refining the gameplay experience.

Furthermore, the story is nonsensical and poorly written. Unlike the original CS, which had a gripping narrative that kept you engaged from start to finish, CS2's plot feels like a disjointed mess with gaping plot holes and underdeveloped characters. It's impossible to become emotionally invested in the story when everything feels so poorly executed.

To add insult to injury, CS2 is riddled with bugs and glitches. From game-breaking crashes to physics-defying animations, it's clear that the developers rushed the release without properly testing it. It's unacceptable to release a game in such a broken state, and it shows a blatant disregard for the players who spent their hard-earned money on it.

Overall, CS2 is a massive disappointment and a stain on the legacy of the original CS. It fails to capture the magic of its predecessor and instead serves as a reminder of everything that can go wrong with a sequel. Save your money and steer clear of this trainwreck of a game.

That's a problem.

This game is horribly unfun and tedious. You're not playing it because it's skillful, varied, competitive, or fun. You're playing for the barely legal skin stock market attached to it to make money from the textures Valve sells on fake guns like NFTs and crypto, but without the real world usage of crypto, and all of the make-believe usage and regret of NFTs.

Everything you loved about CS, whether it be the goofy and casual multiplayer, the great presentation, variety of unique maps and modes, satisfying weapons, fun physics, iconic sounds, fast-paced gameplay, or even the charming juvenile artsyle from CSS and 1.6 has been stripped down heavily, replaced, or removed with exactly one exception.

And the game is incredibly anti-fun because 20 people in a competitive tournament have fun for more than 2 seconds with this game once a year in some country you don't know the name of because they found some slightly broken gun or strategy by accident and now it's going to be nerfed or removed.

(They don't actually have fun, they just want the money. Listen to any one of them for 2 seconds, and they sound burnt out and exhausted. Just ask Summit1g.)

No experimentation, no fun strategies, no weird or cool new game modes, no fun or interesting maps for more than a month maybe when there's a new operation, and Valve wonders why everyone still plays Dust 2 like the lab rats they've conditioned their players into being. 

Maybe if your game is made with the most basic and repetitive gameplay for 12 year olds on their grandma's laptop, you should expect that. It actively encourages people to play like reckless idiots on the worst map because your punishment for playing well is playing the horrible game more and being blamed for losing when you die from nowhere.

Maybe you would at least provide some of kind of reward or sense of progression for playing it, right? Well if you count some jpeg you can spray on a wall 50 times that's worth a penny as a reward, then you should just go play a better game. People complain about Call of Duty, but that game is the best selling yearly for a reason.

A lack of progression and rewards give you nothing to show for your time. And the game has actively had many changes targeted at making it less fun when it's far too simplistic to even matter. 

R8 Revolver, sniper scope nerfs, movement is slow and clunky, customization options are just paywalled features from older games but worse, new features they do add are horrible and manipulative. It's all been scientifically made to be worse and make you spend more time and money when nothing is there.

So if anything you can think has been made worse or removed to make money, what does this game do well? Exactly one thing, the story.

CS was not known for its story, but when Valve released Operation Wildfire in 2016, they added a cool coop campaign. It's not even remotely close to Left 4 Dead or Portal 2 coop, but it was a genuine improvement over Condition Zero Deleted Scenes that was somewhat relevant to the rest of the game.

Here it is:
https://youtu.be/xqvOuVd2Ysw

When I played Condition Zero Deleted Scenes, it became pretty clear to me that it was stripped down, pretty generic, and lost in translation between 5 developers who never finished any one of their games. Valve added a neat coop mode that had you doing basic, but fun objectives with easter eggs and little rewards.

This coop multiplayer story hybrid is something that no one has ever done well, and it unfortunately was another case of that, looking more like a hacked together coop mode that a couple modders would put on the workshop. But compared to Condition Zero, this is a welcome improvement.

I would think a multiplayer shooter would have some multiplayer in its story, and a 2 player coop mode is a great way of doing this. However, I don't think this is the highest priority for Valve, seeing how long a second coop campaign took to release.

Check the date on the second video here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdS3un_Z3Zc

A live service game should always be adding new content as opposed to removing it. And be doing so frequently to keep you playing. The only times CSGO adds anything is when it's unfun, so anyone aside from those attending competitive events yearly are benefiting from these stupid decisions.

Games are supposed to be fun first and foremost. And with this in mind, I cannot actively recommend this game to anyone with all of its issues, and terrible anti-fun first attitude. You should not be judged as worse or punished for trying to have fun playing any game, and Valve knows it.

As Valve themselves will say: 

""Any system that generates revenue at a cost of customer happiness is a broken system we need to fix.""

And after 10 years, it should be clear they'll never fix it. Attitude reflects leadership, and that's something no update or patch will ever fix. Cannot recommend.

CS2 Update:

They removed most of the game. I guess they turned up the color saturation now. That's about it. 

So the one excuse I had playing this game is gone. No more arms race, deathmatch, or other casual modes. To be fair, every call of duty does them all better anyway, so if you really want to play this bad game, even when Valve doesn't want you to, just go to the Betas and select the [Demo_Viewer] version. It's really not worth your time, and calling it a tactical game is stupid.

It's an arena game with low health and bad guns, difference is that Counter Strike Source is $10 and you can't pay me to play this. Plus they also screwed over their core audience of people with bad pcs and laptops. So good luck playing it now. I'm going back to Payday 2, later.

Arms race update:
So I saw Valve added arms race back in, but I don't even know why they bothered because they only have 2 maps and both look like an Unreal Engine 4 game from 2015. If you're going to piecemeal the game I originally purchased in 2015 back to me, could you at least have the common courtesy of making sure all the old maps are in there? ""Remastering"" two maps that are equal to shipment in COD4 is not some hard work of art, it's literally just a texture pack. And not even a good one, I might add.

Let's put more effort examining them than Valve did ""remastering"" them. Shoots now has no sniper cover, and the map has worse visibility than CSGO. They also removed the cool rain and pirates. Baggage added a ton of ladders and walkways so you can spawncamp even more than before. Now you can get on top of a vent and ambush both sides while having cover from the garage door. And instead of looking like a real life airport, it looks like a generic Overwatch map. St. Marc, Monastery, Safehouse, and Lake are gone.

I despise this game so much for a very good reason. The only thing this game used to have going for it was that it was more of a cops and robbers game with real life police and domestic terrorist groups and their history and tactics being used to flavor what is an otherwise extremely boring army game. I find this vandalism of the real world wars on terrorism and real life police and army ties to be extremely disrespectful to myself, Hidden Path, those who have served, and you reading.

CSGO was building a world and a cool co-op story with danger zone and the various fun and casual modes they would add in every so often. It was a lot like Halo 5 by the end of its lifecycle, where it was a fun game that both competitive and casual players could enjoy and that had a lot of fun and experimental content with a big community that made cool custom modes and maps. It was like call of duty but without any of the usual toxic pitfalls those games fell into and all of the fun social aspects you came to know and love.

Now it's gone. Hope those skins were worth it. Death to CS2.",1466959636,1708240998,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I began playing Counter-Strike in 2005 with CS 1.6. I watched Wisenhunt and cut many old habits from shooters like Halo using long practice sessions and much research. I found internet cafes that hosted local competitions and placed in the tops on all of them. I got down more than a few times going into a higher level of play. Learned discipline, sportsmanship, and respect. I worked my way through the professional scene into national competition, and only once landed into internationals.

My Global Offensive rank is Silver Elite as of this review.(Supreme Master First Class before the 'Great Elo Shift')

I will wholly recommend this game for anyone who wants to learn the basics of competitive shooters, have a good time, and make new friends.
I will never recommend this game as a professional competitive environment without utilizing a third party system.

Valve is an entirely different company, and this game is no longer a Counter-Strike game in my view. So many updates down the pipeline of this former Source console port has seen it deteriorate into a fully accessible CS Clone with many issues.

Let's begin with proper configuration to play this game in any semblance of professional play.
Block https://blog.counter-strike.net from your network
The ingame widgets drag anywhere between a few kb's to 100MB/s from your network and stay on even during a match
Use custom configuration maps or files to remove in-game bloat
Change your entire game options tab to suit what anyone in the game would actually use (Why would default be anything other than 1???)
Then hopefully you've paid your way into competitive, or you're in for some of the nastiest third world country behavior you've ever seen on your road to arbitrarily rank a different leveling system than you'll ever pay attention to for the rest of your life, outside of once a year for a participation trophy (or way more colors of said trophy if you play 24/7).
You'll be very naive to believe you can play this game solo, especially without Prime. In the end if you want to be serious, they will take your money, and your data as you'll have to fork your phone number out to another ripe internet repository to be stored indefinitely whilst you play.
As a previous iteration user, you'll find controls are never as responsive, spread is rampantly enforced now, and you'll be placed with anyone between an equivilent to complete noobs to professionals all in the area of around 4 ranks as the 'Great Elo Shift' mentioned previously has taken full affect in bringing some of the worlds strongest players to the end of Silver rankings whilst complete imbeciles are still amongst them as well. You can no longer use skillful strategy, as shots are left entirely to chance, noone else knows to lower their latency by blocking the CS blog, and everyone has an entirely skewed idea of what ""skill"" even looks like.
this is where I have to say. for the set of users like myself that helped build an entire community around Counter-Strike...
Press Uninstall, and enjoy Source.

/// Below this is my original CS:GO review, left up for posterity.

CS:GO is a highly competitive skill-based first-person shooter that will eventually pay for itself in skin and sticker drops. Tons of game modes both casual and competitive and deep gameplay make it hard not to come back a few times a week. You can sell drops on market for a few pennies for junk up to bigger chunks of cash for popular or high-quality weapon and knife skins.

This game regularly goes on sale for as low as $3.75. If you're only a casual player, that might be the price to shoot for. If you're looking for a competitive shooter to sink more time into, even full price is gonna be worth it.",1395448907,1708226073,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The CS2 we got and the there lack off proper updates is deplorable; from basic game mechanics and movement being ruined and changed for the worse to the so called ""sub-tick"" system where those with lower ping and higher frames get the advantage in nearly every situation. What you see, isn't what you get as peaker's advantage is still a huge issue while your own bullets are seemingly whiffing through enemy player models and sprays feeling like an inconsistent mess. 

The ranking system on competitive mode is beyond skewed, for reference; once being global doesn't mean anything in CS2, starting ranks will nearly always be silver and good luck getting out of it. Silver in CS2 is more likely anywhere from Nova to GE on CS:GO from the games I've experienced, and without a pre-made team you gamble to end up with either players with sub 50 hours and no experience to over 5k hour try-hards. You're better off playing Premier which has it's very own massive flaw just like standard competitive; cheaters.

Cheating is now more rampant than I've ever seen in CS:GO, every other premier game has either a closet cheater, a full blown cheater with a fresh account and (possibly) smurfs with barely any playtime. Demos are being 'corrupted' left and right and there is still no Overwatch, VAC is banning those with DPI switch buttons on their mouses instead of those that actually full blown cheat and that doesn't bode well considering VAC-Live was expected by many to actually function. Don't let A.I fix your game. FIx it yourself. Get a part of the team actively snooping out cheat development and counter it instead of recreating an already outdated trash anti-cheat that doesn't work.

Valve likes us players to think they're doing something for the game but, adding old content back in after 4 months, dropping a new case with a shiny new knife and only updating the game when a Tournament is actively going on to casually fix some minor things won't solve the larger issues this game faces and unless they start working on actually improving the game and fixing the mess they created this game will continue to lose it's actively dwindling player-base. 

I hate being so negative about a game I used to be so passionate about, but CS2 has let me down massively. Each time I play I'm reminded on how good CS:GO was compared to what we got now. Yes graphically the game is great but, in my humble opinion, it wasn't for the better considering the trade-off we got; good ol' CS:GO replaced for a beautiful but, buggy mess filled with cheaters.",1527002067,1708225561,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But seriously it is surprising how this makes the game far less tilting / frustrating to play. 

I do miss arms race because that was my warm up, before competitive and casual is no substitute because even with lower ranked players you are going to die in arms race, which is not the case in a causal game.

I was toying with the idea of using retakes for warm up instead, which is also not present in CS2 (at least just now) but those really long to get achievements were keeping me with arms race (Never will have the chance to get them now).

Hope they at least bring back these two modes and I would not mind all the other missing modes too.

Only very real negative would be the Premier matchmaking, which is great until you get to a rank up match. This is were it falls down, People disconnect from matches or you are paired with people who seem to have never played the game before and even when I carry a match (rare but it happens) its not enough to actually win the match. I will say if you have a five stake am I sure it is absolutely super to play this mode. However, I think they need to tweak the solo queue players to have a more even match at this point - even match of 10 people on a rank up game would better (salty but better).

Lastly the ranks per map for competitive mode actually seems like a really good idea, though it does take ages to get a rank especially if you are like myself and play all the maps in turn (remove a map each time I play it until all maps have been played and then re-queue them all again, etc.).

Anyway that is my opinion of the game to date. Hope it helps someone out there.

Addendum: I attained a rank on Dust II and just had my first game with other ranked players and it felt just like a game should feel playing amongst the correct skill level of players, I was the lowest rank and if felt like it. Its just getting to the rank on each map that is going to be a age to achieve. I think it would be better to have a matches to get an overall rank on every map you played first and then after that it would change to ranks per map, just to get over the getting a rank hurdle.",1448215375,1708207138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* missing popular game modes (DangerZone, WarGames, etc)
* there are *still* perf issues with this game! (frame rate drops)

* and in the 21st century in deathmatch we still drop new players right next to live players...

really Valve.. what were you thinking??

CS2 is still not up to par

* all the above issues persist
* DM servers have max player limits too high 
* DM servers have no spawn camp protection and no logic around spawn protection 
* sub-tick is w-i-e-r-d... is it working? or is it b0rk3n? who knows.

* THEY HAVE RUINED THIS GAME *

Plenty of better FPSs on the market today.

BTW: I couldn't find a single improvement compared to the orginal CS:Source which I played roughly two decades ago.

The CS2 Update nuked the unranked normal game mode, so there's no way for a beginner to learn playing the game in a realistic environment. You're forced to play either the competitive Premier mode, in which you only get assigned a skill group after winning 10 matches, or the generic ranked mode in which, again, you need to win 10 matches on each map to be assigned the respective map's skill group.
Since you're matched up against players with thousands of hours of experience until you get a skill group, you're probably going to lose a lot more than you win. This leads to you having to play a frustrating amount of games with unfair skill disparities between teams.
There's not even a lot you can learn from playing against much better opponents other than ""Guess I should aim better."" and ""Maybe I shouldn't have been here."".
On top of the enemy probably ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on your head every game, your team mates will flame and even kick vote you out of the game if your performance can't keep up with the rest.

This has been adjusted and feels way better now.

Settings need work, Fullscreen locks in wrong resolution and can't be changed. 
Don't see why there can't be a Hold option for Snipers for those who don't like Toggle.

Also there should be a damage report after the round, showing where you hit or got hit. It is in Deathmatch, why not everywhere?

Economy feels like it needs some adjusting, you can win 7 rounds in a row and after losing 1 not having money, combined with the big loss bonus, doesn't feel right.

Feels like there is a lot of room for performance optimization too, framerates seem to change often, especially after updates, either that or frametimes, not sure.

These days the game is full of hackers, and when you aren't contending with hackers then you contend with random lag spikes that make no sense in the game, and if its not the lag and its not the cheaters that get you, then its the terribly optimised maps! 

Why my GTX2070 has frame drops on Overpass and Ancient every time I am around water... hell only the devs will know... weirdly my brother WITH THE SAME graphics card and almost identical setup has no issues.

And when I finally decide that its time to play a premier then I am greeted with toxic team mates who in round one call ""NO ONE LOVES YOU, NO ONE CARES FUCK OFF AND DIE"" then I am only left to wonder why I even started playing this game again?

The developers clearly do not care about the cheating problem, it really is an easy fix, but only they will know why they wont address it. Maybe the cheater problem is bigger than we all think and if Valve actually does something about it then we may realise that there are only about 500 of us in the world who plays legit?! Who knows.

All I know is that after 4 600 hours. I am done with this game, its not worth investing the time in this anymore. I will rather go off to Valorant where the anti cheat actually works.

And the best thing, it replaced the old version.. 

1. Matchmaking and Ranking.
You need 10 wins PER MAP to get ranked...
In this Time you meet so much hackers and players with > 5k hours of CS.

In the end... you cant get a Rank, because you cant win!
Sometime you get a Hacker in your Team and will win very EZ, because no one will kick him.

2. New Buymenue
WHY did they Chance the buycodes?!

3. There is no AntiCheat or Overwatch anymore...
So its Cheaters heaven! Not that the old VAC was any good..
But delete overwatch and VAC at all makes this game to one of the hacker
infected games ever!

4. Reporting System
If you and your friend hate one player?
Just report him for Griefing and get others to do so.. There is a

I guess it might just not really be my kind of thing. I've not played many games like it and I find the mini games like arms race, or just messing around in servers to be a more enjoyable experience. This is just my opinion and I know that there are large numbers of people who enjoy it and have played far more time than I have. But not my cup of tea.

Edit: 80 hours and around 5 years later and I really haven't changed how I feel about this game. It has it's upsides, I've certainly found myself having fun at times, but it's just not a game I *like*, or it's not something the game itself does that gave me the enjoyment, but enjoying it in spite of what I dislike because I had friends to play it with.

Could Tetris be a covert ploy fomented by the former USSR to distribute Communist propaganda throughout the western world? Is Tetris truly what it would appear to be or is it in fact the most successful subterfuge of the twentieth century?

I seek to prove that Tetris is in fact a simulated microcosm of the philosophy of Marx and Engels, a clever encryption of the penultimate revolution to be held by the proletariat at the expense of the bourgeoisie. 

To begin I must typify who the players of this Marxist melodrama are. The player serves as a member of the bourgeoisie, perhaps a wealthy factory owner or a land baron, and the falling blocks which litter the screen are representations of the proletariat. Nameless and faceless, the anonymous members of the proletariat are sacrificed at the altar of capitalist greed by the bourgeoisie player whose only goal is to convert his proletariat pawns into capital, as represented by the player‚Äôs score. Now this score is truly meaningless, an ethereal measurement of wealth accrued at the expense of others for no other purpose than to elevate the player‚Äôs ego and to serve as a means of comparing how well one member of the bourgeoisie does in relation to another. This is capitalist one-upsmanship at its finest. ‚ÄúDamn the expense so long as I have more than anyone else,‚Äù what a comforting philosophy to be fostering among today‚Äôs youth.

However, the player cannot gain wealth perpetually. Just as in Marxist doctrine the revolution of the proletariat is inevitable; eventually the player will make a mistake in his or her manipulation of the proletariat and the player will pay for it, dearly. The proletariat will rise up. Uniting as one the working-class blocks build ever higher, ascending to the bourgeoisie throne and casting down the player, the proletariat seizes the means of production and the reigns of government. Game over.

This end is inevitable, the Revolution cannot be stopped; it can only be postponed. No matter how skilled the bourgeoisie is no amount of cajoling, bribery, or intimidation will save them. The player will lose, always. The only comfort to the disenfranchised player is the hard-lost score, a miniscule, meaningless number, the only testament to their struggle and a taunting reminder of their former glory.",1421346562,1708103649,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. INTRUSIVE ANTI CHEAT 

2. 128 tick, if subtick must stay, provide definitive proof that it is better. For anyone wondering 
     why the gun play feels so bad (though not the only reason) Valve scaled down the spray 
     patterns for weapons, the reason being ""it will make it feel more like 128 tick"" oookay.. so 
     Valve says back in GO the patterns were vastly different between 64 tick servers and 128 
     tick, just blatantly talking out of our asses now aren't we Valve? Main reason for 
     confronting this, being that if subtick is so much better than 128 tick ever could be, why are 
     we trying to get it as close as we can to 128 tick and failing at it too? Subtick is just another 
     way of saying: Here at Valve we are cheap bastards and will NOT invest our endless cash 
     flow into better servers for the player base that is the source of that cash flow in the first 
     place. Classic capitalistic bullshittery, If your company is making profits make sure to never 
     give back, cut costs, and sacrifice quality at every turn.
      
3. Fix peekers advantage and overall player model movement speed.
     a. Actually align your hit boxes with your animations. 
     b. Drastically reduce the run n' gun/ jumping while shoot accuracy. (for all weapons)
     c. Eliminate the dramatic player model sway from side to side/ back to front. 

4. Go through the laughably small map selection you brought to the table on your over hyped 
    rushed release, and actually clip edges and angles. (lets not wait forever like pit on dust 2 
    in GO, before all the maps started to get a fresh update back in 2016)
     a. Add more maps (ones that fit the fundamentals of CS)
     b. Drastically reduce the lighting and shadow effects, they are super cool I like the engine 
         and its capabilities, however this use of lighting does NOT fit competitive play. 
     c. Remove Ancient, it fundamentally does not fit CS. Mid is a fuster cluck, the rest of the 
         map is a series of narrow funnels onto sites with too many angles to clear, and nowhere 
         to sensibly rotate in any timely manor, etc.

5. This is a simple one Valve, are you ready? I swear its not rocket science, you may want a 
     pad and pen though. Okay here we go..  Make the guns do the correct damage, especially 
     through objects and certain materials. Its like you guys lost all the data you had on 
     ballistics and are just winging it at this point, it has been stated that CS:GO was just ported 
     over to Source 2, did anyone even attempt to check and dare I say double check anything 
     at all?

6. Fix the economy.

   
  CS2 development team really could just keep sitting around being useless fuckers with 
  mounds of cash to blow up their own asses, or they could have some self respect and pride 
  in their work for once. 
  Now the whole dev team sits there and disregards everything because they've now been 
  bullied about it. Truth is I'd praise you if you did anything worth a shit lmao.

i played the beta and now the game is fully released
during beta testing i hoped that issues with performance and bugs would be fixed at launch
they weren't also subtick sucks

28/10/2023
This game is a pathetic mess, hitreg is non existant, performance is f*cking adorable, valve sends patches about ""cracks in walls"" on ancinet instead of fixing the problems that are ruining the entire experience
people with high end PCs struggle to keep a smooth game while hacing 300+ fps
once there is a shootout with more than 1 smoke the game becomes a powerpoint presentation
and i average 200 fps in it
VACs for high sens, flying boosts, pathetic matchmaking,
CS:GO had some issues too, performance dropped due to the amount of stuff put in a really old gfx engine, and when we pictured csgo going into source 2 engine we expected the game to run better, we dont need the ultra splashing water with metric f*ckton of particles, we dont need volumetric smoke that lags the entire server once you throw more than 2 CS2 is dying, rapidly losing playerbase and soon skins will be worthless and game will sit in dust
Don't buy prime, you're just wasting money
wait untill the game's playable, prolly around 2047

However, I learned new language skills: now I can curse in Russian and Brazilian Portuguese.

Also, my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased.

Now I can bear the crying of my children for longer and I can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures, such as –û—á–∏ —á—ë—Ä–Ω—ã–µ (Dark Eyes) or Garota de Ipanema (The Girl from Ipanema).

In conclusion, Counter Strike transformed me into a better father and a better person, in addition to making me more patient, tolerant to hateful people and more trained in languages and cultures.

^ this was my review for CS:GO

As for CS2... what a dogshit experience; rubber-banding players and saying they are sitting below 30 ms. Don't bother with 'skill based matchmaking' unless you have 4 or 5 to a party because you will get unranked enemies that one tap every round and teammates that don't wear headsets or microphones.

Want to land shots? Well CS2 will have you standing still against a still enemy and once you aim for the head and shoot a bullet it will miss, yet the trail will show it going through the enemy.  But rest assured, the enemy will be able to headshot your team while running no matter the angle :)

Want to kick a random that is AFK or throwing? Can't do that if you're queued as 4 people because then the person doing the griefing won't get a say in the vote.... makes sense

Have confidence in VAC? One of my best friends gets reported and banned within a 5 minute period for aim assist at 4 kills round 20+ using an auto-shotgun. Don't worry though, all of those level 1-4 steam accounts with no hours headshotting your team the whole game won't be penalized for anything like THAT.

TLDR: CS:GO is dead and Valve killed it for a clearly worse experience... good thing there's a new case though, right?",1525726997,1707979028,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

One the one hand, the game looks amazing, the new smoke grenades are really cool to play with, and the gameplay feels largely unchanged, apart from the new subtick system. On the other hand, we've lost a lot of things from CS:GO, such as easy in-game access to workshop maps, changing the bot difficulty for bot matches, and even most console commands that a lot of people use, such as cl_righthand and cl_bob. Not to mention the wide raft of bugs and glitches that came with this ""full launch"". If you ask me, it feels like the Counter Strike community is taking part in a forced public beta of Counter Strike 2. I would honestly wait until Valve fixes a lot of the bugs in the game, which may take quite a while, knowing Valve.

Edit 11/10/2023:
With the update a few days ago, the game feels a lot better to play. I feel like my shots are going where they're supposed to, and I'm pleased with the progress that Valve has made in terms of making the game playable. However, key features from CS:GO are still missing, such as cl_righthand and cl_bob. Workshop support has been finally introduced to CS2, and in my experience works well. I am still a bit hard pressed to recommend CS2 at this stage of the game's lifespan. I would encourage new players to wait for one or two more large updates before playing, or ideally holding off until the first CS2 Operation comes out. But it is playable at this stage.

Edit 2: 2/14/2024:
The game plays a lot better after the Arms Race update, but now there are issues with lower frame rates and more lag. Also, cl_righthand and cl_bob are still absent, but this could be due to Valve trying to make things more equal, or potentially trying to add it into the settings menu, rather than have it be confined to the console. Either way, Valve has been rather slow to fix the game and/or add new content, but the important thing is that fixes and new content are both in the works.",1696922809,1707944805,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played all the way to 1.6 and had a blast (tho nades acted diff in 1.6 and took a long time getting used to but whatever).  Then years later GO comes out and you restrict aim on weapons and some of the features the original had.  It felt like you just took some of the heart and soul out of the game and gave us a zombie version.  Still playable and recognisable, but not what we loved and wanted to continue playing.  Years later we come to today where I paid 20 bucks for the premium of CS2 and I wasted my money.  This is awful.  The summary is:

 ""Play a game with 2 teams that dont matter bc its all free for all and your guy is a simple who can't aim down gun sights or run fast and are stuck in a basic limited version of our once glorious game"".  

All the franchise and history behind this game and in it's now current form I'd have to say i feel sad and embarrassed for the dev team.  Maybe good things should come to an end and fade away.  God knows I wont see another half life game out before I pass but wow Alyx was super duper so maybe thats a good thing. All you did was make a game based on an older version of one of your games and then strip it down until its broken and pointless and has no essence of the original aside from copying the maps.  Anyways, don't buy this, this game is awful.  I would suggest an actual shooter with actual game modes for near the same price, or free.  Most anything from the last decade will have these features and not be a clone of something in its former glory.  Stay away, dont buy unless they ever add actual game modes other then free for all....like, you have free for all but you load in as 2 teams?

Just horrible!

Valve what have you done?

Movement is broken.
Hitboxes are broken.
Aim is squishy.
Audio is like having your head under water.
Subtick system is not working and feels a lot worser than 64 tick.
Nothing is static - hit reg is a random ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and based on luck
Looks more like a comic than a tactic shooter.
Cheaters everywhere.
HUD is just distracting and way to big.
In comparsion to CG:GO it will eat up a lot more resources and will run your components even in the menu hot.


There was no need to purge a working game with a open beta.
Sorry, but you cant literally dont play this game crap.

Valve, congratulate yourself for polishing graphics, physics and do some stuff how granades work.
I hope somebody will lose his job for this.

I'm pretty sick of this community. Only toxic, ""I'm the best"", COD TDM players. Pure sh1t ch3aters. 
Stucking in <5000 ranking becaus of team mates leaving during the match or players who thinking they are the next simple. 
Valve, please give the russians theyr own game servers for doing stupid things. Nobody wants to play with them.


I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!

Update 02/14/24:
Its getting worser and worser. Cheaters everywhere. If you want to see how VAC Live is working download this game.
I do face players in almost every match with newly created profiles, Steam Level <4 or profiles not even set up.

nice game recommended.. 



CS2 from 2023
CS2 certainly has its moments. The gameplay is often exhilarating, providing an intense experience for fans of the genre. The variety of maps and game modes keeps things fresh and engaging. Additionally, the selection of weapons and equipment is impressive, allowing players to find their own playstyle.

The graphics and sound are also well-executed. The visuals are appealing and contribute to immersion, while the soundtrack and effects enhance the game's tension.

But to be honest, all the good is overshadowed by the presence of cheaters. It's frustrating to play against individuals who cheat and manipulate the game to win. It undermines the integrity of the game and makes it difficult to truly enjoy. It's disappointing to see that the development team isn't doing much to address this issue.

Overall, my opinion of CS2 is mixed. It has great potential, but the presence of cheaters makes it difficult to fully enjoy. I really hope the development team can address this problem better in the future because the game has the potential to be truly great.",1499831648,1707928709,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I had to come back and edit it, to tell you I have 420 hours in game. Yes, that is important.
Once again, I am here on an important time, as my playtime has reached 444.. need I say more?
On another edit, this time I've reached 500 hours. A lot of time wasted now.

555hours ;D next one coming with god himself.

satan was 777, right?
not quite there yet, just around seven eleven, but I just needed to say thanks to a great, really great teammate i just got. He is name ayo... literally, and that 1-8 comeback wingman tie made my late Christmas.

You queue without prime  to try the game. You enjoy bots in deathmatch, you get in a match of comp, people try to cover their hacks till you kill them because idk maybe you're playing the game. They say: OMG HACKS. Turns out they did have cheats the whole time and were waiting for an excuse to press Insert.

You buy prime, thinking Oh I paid money. Others paid money. No Cheating because Money Lost. Well people spin-bot in prime (literally turning around themselves and wallbang you before you even see anything) and wiping whole teams. 

Do I recommend cs2 ? No. Do I recommend Prime ? No, Definitely not. Do I recommend skins ? What for, to spend hours getting killed and looking at another hacker point of view, No thanks. 

You think faceit is better ? You think Lan matters? 

Just watch my cs2 trailer and click install.

CS2 is a highly anticipated sequel to the critically acclaimed CS1, promising advanced features, improved performance, and an enhanced user experience. In this review, we'll delve into the key aspects of CS2 and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

User Interface:
CS2 boasts a sleek and intuitive user interface, making navigation and task execution seamless. The redesigned layout enhances productivity, with customizable options catering to diverse user preferences. However, some users may find the learning curve steep initially.

Features:
CS2 introduces a plethora of new features, including enhanced code analysis tools, advanced debugging capabilities, and seamless integration with popular development frameworks. The addition of AI-driven code suggestions and automated refactoring tools streamlines development workflows, significantly boosting productivity. However, the sheer breadth of features may overwhelm novice users, necessitating comprehensive training and support.

Performance:
CS2 exhibits commendable performance improvements over its predecessor, with faster compilation times, reduced memory footprint, and smoother execution of resource-intensive tasks. The optimized codebase ensures swift responsiveness, even when handling large-scale projects. However, occasional performance bottlenecks may arise under heavy workloads, requiring periodic optimization and fine-tuning.

Compatibility:
CS2 maintains backward compatibility with CS1 projects, facilitating seamless migration for existing users. Furthermore, cross-platform support ensures compatibility with a wide range of operating systems and development environments, enhancing flexibility and accessibility. However, compatibility issues with certain third-party plugins or libraries may arise, necessitating proactive troubleshooting and updates.

Community Support:
CS2 benefits from a vibrant and active community of developers, fostering collaboration, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement. Online forums, documentation resources, and user groups provide invaluable support, helping users overcome challenges and unlock the full potential of the platform. Additionally, regular updates and bug fixes demonstrate the developer's commitment to addressing user feedback and enhancing product quality.

Conclusion:
CS2 stands as a formidable successor to CS1, offering a compelling suite of features, improved performance, and robust community support. While the learning curve and occasional performance issues may pose challenges, the overall experience is highly rewarding for developers seeking a powerful and versatile coding environment. With its innovative tools and collaborative ecosystem, CS2 sets a new standard for modern software.

People have been playing this game for years and have countless hours into this game and the previous iterations of counter strike and will just annihilate you. Whether that be from skill, cheating, or you just sucking; you won't have very much fun. 

The state of the game now (at the time of review) is not as complete as the players were hoping for. It's missing half the maps CSGO had and other niche things like Overwatch. Valve will (hopefully) add the rest of the components in over time but as of right now the game itself, is complete; just not as complete and polished like CSGO. It has the popular maps, all the guns, and skins that players typically care the most about; its just not at its full potential. Which is annoying for a lot of players too including myself, but, at least we can still play it.

The cheating also described in other reviews is not exaggerated either. There are a substantial amount of noticeable cheaters. More than in CSGO. I really don't know why that is; I'm not a game developer or a cheat software engineer or a cheat seller/user. All I know is that I see much more memorable cheating in CS2 as opposed to when CSGO was around. I'm hoping Valve does whatever they need to do to remedy that faster than they have been moving so far. Don't say I didn't warn you. 

Given all that information, I still do enjoy this game. It's still counter strike and will always be a marvel for FPS's world wide for years to come. No matter how clunky, goofy, glitchy, or aggravating, it will always be fun. Valve will continue to improve on it patch after patch until its finally complete. I will always come back to counter strike for some good ol' fashioned janky hitbox fun. But if you're new or returning, don't let the bad reviews or what I said discourage you. Just play it. If you hate it, just uninstall. The game is free for crying out loud.",1707883635,1707883635,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's dive:

Sub-tick rate feels like a joke right now. Movement is clumsy, running with mates to the same place as terrorists feels like garbage. Dropping bomb, guns and grenades feels wrong. Insane peeker advantage. Spraying and tapping feels bad.

The audio is not on par with CSGO. Definitely needs some improvement, but it's still miles ahead of Valorant's, or should I say, leagues better.

Lack of QoL. I never could get into COD, because of all the handshaking. I'm not starring in a rap music video to throw my hands everywhere. It's not THAT bad, but I would love to see me some cl_bob action in a console.

The last point is optional, I can see where Valve is going with this. They're trying to create the same experience for everybody. I absolutely love the new jump-throw mechanic. Lack of r_cleardecals feels like a right choice, that is if the blood splatters and bodies are the same on every client. The follow recoil option on a crosshair is a nice touch.

I never really liked faceit that much. The idea of splitting the community that way is wrong. But matchmaking felt unrewarding. You get the Global Elite and that's it. Boring. That's why I love the new CS rating. And would've loved it even more if I haven't been playing vs 5-man stacks. I understand that it's not as severe as playing vs a 5-man stack in Dota, but, for the love of GabeN, add a strict solo queue. And make it so the Enter button would accept a game.

I see a lot of people ain't happy. From the release date up to right now CS2 got around 60% positive reviews on Steam. They want to see Arms Race, Danger Zone, Mac support, Achievements. I say fuck all that.

I love Valve for doing the groundbreaking work, for supporting Linux, for Steam, for the memes. I wasn't even mad when The Artifact was released. But this time I got hit hard.

I know that Valve will deliver eventually, because they are good at fixing things. But at the time when Dota 2 was released, which I didn't like, I had Warcraft to go back to. Same with CSGO and CSS. This time I have a broken game that I don't wanna play. And that's a pity.

Actually, now that I've used my brain power to put thoughts into writing, I'm not mad anymore and will be leaving a positive review on Steam. Cya in Premier.",1707877701,1707877701,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Introduction:
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, commonly known as CS:GO, stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of tactical first-person shooters. Developed by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment, this iconic title has solidified its place in the esports pantheon since its release in 2012. As we delve into the intricacies of CS:GO, it becomes evident why this game remains a cornerstone in the competitive gaming landscape.

Graphics and Art Direction:
CS:GO might not boast the hyper-realistic graphics of some contemporary titles, but its visual style is deliberate and effective. The minimalist approach allows players to focus on the gameplay, with clean and easily distinguishable character models and environments. The art direction strikes a balance between realism and playability, contributing to the game's timeless aesthetic.

Gameplay:
At its core, CS:GO is an unparalleled experience in tactical gameplay. The emphasis on teamwork, strategy, and precise gunplay sets it apart from other shooters. The game features two distinct factions, terrorists and counter-terrorists, each with unique objectives. Rounds are intense, short, and demand split-second decision-making, creating a palpable sense of tension that keeps players on the edge of their seats.

Weapons and Economy:
The weapon system in CS:GO is a masterpiece of balance. From pistols to sniper rifles, each firearm serves a specific purpose, requiring players to make strategic choices based on their team's economy and the current round situation. The economy system, where players earn money for kills and objectives, adds a layer of depth, forcing teams to carefully manage their resources for the best chance of success.

Maps:
CS:GO boasts a diverse map pool, each with its own distinct layout and challenges. Classic maps like Dust II and Mirage continue to be fan favorites, while new additions like Vertigo and Overpass bring refreshing changes to the competitive landscape. The map design encourages varied strategies, ensuring that no two matches feel the same.

Esports Integration:
CS:GO has become synonymous with competitive gaming, with a thriving esports scene that has captivated millions worldwide. Major tournaments, such as the ESL One series and the ELEAGUE Major, draw massive viewership, showcasing the game's enduring appeal and providing a platform for top-tier teams and players.

Community and Modding:
One of CS:GO's strengths lies in its robust community and modding support. The Steam Workshop allows players to create and share custom maps, skins, and game modes, fostering creativity and community engagement. The support for third-party competitive platforms like Faceit and ESEA further extends the game's lifespan beyond casual play.

Conclusion:
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a timeless masterpiece that has withstood the test of time in the ever-evolving landscape of gaming. Its emphasis on skill, strategy, and teamwork, coupled with a thriving esports scene and a dedicated community, solidifies its status as a quintessential title in the first-person shooter genre. As CS:GO continues to evolve with updates and new content, it remains a must-play for both seasoned veterans and newcomers looking to experience the pinnacle of competitive gaming.",1707681763,1707860804,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

I had a blast playing this game back in 2014-2016.
but then they changed the tag system and it made me depressed, I get it, I misplayed and now you punish me, don't make me a cripple just kill me faster already.

So i moved to surf and i became more relaxed, and i have met some awesome friends, and i really had lots of fun. 
Army came by and made me disconnect from the game, but i still came back to it to play some surf and meet some funny individuals, but today its impossible; The transfer to CS2 bugged the slopes in the surf game-mode and made the community server browser very inconsistent. 
 
But i didn't give up, i found out that there is still a playable version of cs:go and the community servers were working, but since the last CS2 update they placed another roadblock that many people don't know they can bypass.

So now surf in CS2 is dead and the community is gone. 

Today i tried for the last time to play CS2 as Valve wants the game to be played, but its very hard for me to do so; the FPS is fucked and the new graphics make it very distracting to detect enemies, and it easily makes my eyes fatigue.
All of this was made so there would be more options for skins (and maybe a nerf to the smoke).

Thank you Valve for killing another game that we all loved.

                                                - wont accept something in what they're wrong

I just recommend this game when you have enough time to put it into this game, you have to be skilled to have fun and some friends. I like this game.

Edit from my previously positive review: CS2 Release2. Game is not ready, the netcode/hitreg does not feel good, sprays are weird, movement feels too slow. Premier Matchmaking is absolutely unbalanced, playing vs former Globals and a lot of enemy 5 stacks when queuing solo. Valve has a lot of work to do.
CS:GO Release vibes, and no one liked that game back then.
Molotovs also explode too unnoticeable kind of, standing in one way too often when they explode behind you. Also smoked don't extinguish them as quickly as in GO, I died in a molotov that I threw a smoke into and walked into the smoke afterwards. Great.

Developed as the much-anticipated successor to the iconic Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), this latest installment in the series undoubtedly brings a fresh coat of paint to the beloved formula.

One of the most striking aspects of Counter Strike 2 is its stunning visual overhaul. From meticulously designed maps to intricately detailed character models, every element of the game exudes a level of polish that is hard to ignore. The updated graphics breathe new life into familiar environments, making each match feel more immersive than ever before.

Moreover, Counter Strike 2 introduces a host of new features and gameplay mechanics that add depth and complexity to the classic formula. Whether it's the addition of new weapons, enhanced customization options, or refined movement mechanics, there's no denying that the developers have gone above and beyond to deliver a truly modernized experience.

The game's multiplayer component remains as addictive as ever, offering intense firefights and strategic gameplay that keeps players coming back for more. The revamped matchmaking system ensures balanced matches, while the inclusion of new game modes adds variety and replayability to the experience.

However, despite its many strengths, Counter Strike 2 does fall short in some areas when compared to its predecessor, CS:GO. While the updated visuals are undeniably impressive, they come at the cost of performance optimization, leading to occasional frame drops and stuttering, particularly on lower-end systems.

Furthermore, while the introduction of new gameplay mechanics is appreciated, some fans may argue that they stray too far from the simplicity and purity of the original Counter-Strike experience. In particular, certain changes to weapon balancing and movement mechanics may alienate longtime players who prefer the more straightforward approach of CS:GO.

In conclusion, Counter Strike 2 is a worthy successor to the iconic franchise that introduces a wealth of new content and features while retaining the core elements that made its predecessors so beloved. While it may not surpass the greatness of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in every aspect, it nonetheless stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of the series and a must-play for fans of competitive first-person shooters.",1707818855,1707818855,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

While the core gameplay remains faithful to its roots, Counter-Strike 2 introduces enhancements that inject fresh energy into the iconic franchise.

However, there are still areas that could benefit from improvement. For solo players, facing full five-stack teams can be a frustrating experience, underscoring the need for better matchmaking algorithms to ensure more balanced matches. Additionally, occasional FPS drops, even on high-end hardware such as the Nvidia RTX 3090, detract from an otherwise seamless gaming experience.

On a positive note, recent updates have finely tuned the sub-tick system, resulting in the most refined gun-play among all Counter-Strike iterations.

The addition of new smokes and loadout features enriches the strategic depth of the game, offering players additional avenues for tactical mastery.

Overall, Counter-Strike 2 maintains its status as a premier competitive shooter, delivering intense tactical gameplay that continues to captivate players worldwide. While there are still areas for improvement, the game's enduring appeal and dedicated player base solidify its position as a cornerstone of the esports landscape.",1415719461,1707814388,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has had a huge impact on my life and has brought me so much happiness and gave me a sense of purpose in my life. not to mention the opportunity to teach newer players how to play competitively,

However, it is clear to me with the reckless updates of CS2, how standoffish and cold Valve treats CS2, and the only true content since release also including a Case, that Valve has no care if CS2 is enjoyable, only if its profitable. Clearly this new case is generating huge revenue for the game. A game that is no where near the state of the game that you have taken from us. A game we all paid for.

I've been a casual for maybe 15 years with this game, and don't see myself stopping. The developers even (sometimes) listen to the community, and implement the changes they want (eventually...) if they're meme'd on hard enough. Counter Strike is an enigma, and I hope it continues to improve as time goes on. Even though we'll never see a CS 3, as Valve cannot count that high.

Seriously, valve, when people are literally giving their inventories away for free, you know you screwed up.
And even if you are going to ""eventually"" add csgo content back in, the community doesn't know that yet. you would need to be more transparent about that.

Seriously though, the wort part in my opinion is you overwrite CSGO and don't give us any form of backwards compatibility with community maps. I wanna play Insertion with my buds. maybe throw in some motel or pool day.

- anti cheat doesn't work, it feels like it's not even turned on!
- very poorly optimized game, CSGO was far from optimized but this takes it to another level of how badly it performs
- lag spike even after using noclip throughout all the maps, still the fps goes from 280 down to 150 just because of a stupid smoke or sudden lag spike
- bad ranking system, who the h*ll in valve had this ""great"" idea...
- movement and recoil are terrible. The recoil feels exaggerated at this point and the movement feels very off and looks terrible
- no more bhop...
- 4:3 is not as sharp as csgo, I can't believe a 10 year old game looks better in 4:3 compared to CS2. Absolute trash...
- no matter what system spec u have YOU WILL LAG A LOT. Even lobanjica said the game doesn't feel smooth and is lagging, he has a 5k euro pc btw

Game is trash because of this. Literally I speak in the mic and get kicked out. Happens very frequently. People in this game are more autistic than anyone. Ruins the whole game. I DO NOT EVEN BE TOXIC. I SPEAK IN THE MIC AND THEY TELL ME TO SHUT UP OR SAY RACIST SLURS. When i talk back BOOM, I see the whole team trolling me, shooting me and then voted to kick me . Then they all kick me out. The team is like a dog following It's owner. When they see the option, they just press F1 and accept it without even thinking. Also I've seen hackers in the game. HAPPENS VERY FREQUENTLY EVEN WHEN I DON't USE MY MIC THEY STILL DO IT. For example if you don't do what they want you to do they'll kick you out. Yes I do place as a team, I ain't trolling.

Update - Kick system is still VERY VERY VERY ABUSED. Game is so trash, really it is. They cut the game by half. There's still hardly any maps, way less then csgo.. Game is still trash. I ain't lying",1692880098,1707747134,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT : Full of cheaters ,feels like a scam, my team full of unranked,silver 1's and such and the enemy mg , gn4 and cheaters (i cant attach the proof here ). Sadly this game is ruined by people with no life .

EDIT2: It seems like after you go +1000 hours the game is a little better as a matter of cheaters,still are,but less I presume,or more lucky to not have meet so many cheaters

EDIT 3: Second time I uninstall this, mega full of cheaters , over-watch anti cheater is off, full of parasites ruining the game ! , if cs 2 will be the same then its the same useless game but with sprinkles on it !

EDIT 4: Instaled cs 2, more cheaters, nothing chanced, they only added a nice graphic, smoke-fire effect and liquid water in mollotow that actually moves. GABE MAH BOI ! You promised 2 years of no cheaters, after 10 years of CSGO this is what we getting ? Its nice cant lie but thats all, looks nice ,we need better backbone against cheaters , a better overwatch system, a better vac, if faceit can do it, why can't steam as also ? :'[ ....

Review a while later:

It really pains me to write this.
In no particular order:

constant crashing
horrific ranking system
even more cheaters somehow
from 250+ FPS to 60 FPS at times
horribly blatant copying from Valorant, lost it's entire identity
servers not being available
gunplay feels worse
worse movement
downgraded maps
worse gameplay to cater towards visuals
limited buy menu for some reason
I hate the tracers
I hate my legs
constant bugs
hits not connecting
pro play being way less enjoyable
12-rounds to eternally please adhd-kids who don't have an attention span
sounds suck or are confusing
a horribly rushed release 
huge content and map cuts
thousands of fun gamemodes, custom maps and community content just gone
skins look worse
scam- and gambling sites being way too lucrative to do anything about
no accessibilty to CSGO at all (if we are blatantly honest, literally noone would play CS2 if CSGO was still accessible)
who thought it was a good idea to remove flags when searching for teammates
horrific matchmaking with 7+ people speaking russian, not communicating or having no clue how this game even works
no friends to play with anymore because everyone dropped it

---

This is it. I was a diehard CSGO fan, I loved everything about it. When CS2 got announced, I was hyped more than anything. They really blew it. From the lackluster release up to now, I always gave them the benefit of the doubt, I always tried to get back into it. It truly is one of the biggest disappointments I got to experience in my life. This is it.

It's just really sad what this game has become. I literally write this with tears in my eyes because there are so many great memories and friends I associate with this game. It really was a part of me. 
Coming back from school to play CSGO with your friends, Getting my buddy's AK redline because I bought him food once, getting scammed on some random third party site as a 14-year old because I wanted to do these trade-up challenges, joining a shitty clan with wonderful people to try to get better, learning nade lineups until 3am to instantly forget most of them, all the randoms I connected with along the way, all the clutches I shadowplayed thinking I was the next S1mple. Creating a second account and sharing it with my friends, all the hours playing hide-and-seek, my word-file where I wrote down all the dream inventories I wished I could affort, all of my favorite YouTubers and Pro-Players. Dropping to Silver Elite Master which unironically became a long lasting meme within my friendgroup, to then finally reach Global after 2000+ hours. I even wanted to tattoo the bomb code on my arm god dammit. 

And it all got taken away from me just like that. It's so over, my life has peaked a long time ago.

I don't care if you call me old-fashioned, I don't care if CS2 is plenty successful, I don't care about any other opinion, the game is dead to me. 

At long last, goodbye CSGO.",1556095600,1707725971,False,1,3,0.496054142713546753,0,True,False,False

PREVIOUS REVIEW

CS2 released in open beta, but Valve felt pressure to call it a game release because they announced a deadline that they couldn't meet. The problem is that they didn't push the deadline back, and as we have seen many times in the past like 5 or so years, gamers would rather have a FINISHED game then a buggy mess that will age well. If only you guys had put this game up for open beta, and fixed the bugs that we had known about since closed beta, this wouldn't be that big of a deal. Like how are the physics in your engine inconsistent?",1587629964,1707720118,False,0,0,0.463576167821884155,0,True,False,False

The two sides are fun and nice there. The different sides make it nice and fun. I like to play the game because there are people there to play the game with on the counter strike 2 maps. There are different game modes too. Pretty much you have to use the guns in those as well. You have to shoot the bad guys all the time when inside the game. I know people that like to be on my side of team to shoot the bad guys. Do not shoot people on the side you are on because they will say bad things to you.

For some reason, CS2 just feels like a repackaged CS:GO for hardcore players who loved that and didn't want it to change at all. The shooting feels cleaner and the game is prettier with some better load times, but there's nothing new as far as content goes outside of the loadout system, which essentially boils down to restricting your gun selections while in-game, outside of the ability to take both variants of the M4. Valve had the chance to offer a rating system and anti-cheat that solidified it as the premier competitive shooter choice, but instead VAC got mass-cracked before the game even came out and cheating is running as rampant as ever before. On top of that, now it requires you to WIN 10 games on each map before you're rated for that map and that map only, so you're at the mercy of playing absolute killers on their unranked 4th account until you can pull off some wins. This may take longer than you remember, as the ""short match"" option has been removed from competitive games, as have many of the other game modes that you could just play instead. There is no carry-over rank from CS:GO despite this being basically the same game. There are no new maps or weapons, and changes to existing weapons seem non-existent, with many guns are still feeling pointless.

If your intention is to stand by a franchise you've been playing for decades (no matter what) or to become the next great eSports shooter pro, I'm sure you'll love this. If that's not you, there's competitors who offer much better experiences. Counter-Strike 2 will most likely be continue to be the leading competitive FPS for hardcore players due to it's history, but it's probably going to be a hard pass for most people looking for something new to play.",1648613991,1707683041,False,2,1,0.551326215267181396,0,True,False,False

Fine, but I miss Demolition, and they need to bring Monastery back into the Arms Race rotation.

Updated Review (Counter-Strike 2 @ Release - Not Recommended):
Yo, fuck this noise. This bullshit ain't even got Arms Race or Demolition.


Original Review (CS:GO - Recommended):
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive adds a much-needed component to an otherwise long-lasting and fun action game: accessibility! The addition of Deathmatch, Arms Race (unofficially better known as ""Gun Game""), and Demolition help new players acclamate themselves to the weapons and team dynamics found in more traditional competitive modes. While matchmaking's fun, there's still a server browser, for those of you craving custom maps, rules and play modes.

Sadly, they added cosmetics. And while it's helping keep Valve in business, it ultimately adds nothing to the game, minus community members who try to grind through matches (i.e. ""Just let playerX win."") whenever a new chest is released. Oh, and a lot of the CS community is *still there,* though in a gesture of acknowledgement of how troll-filled competitive shooters can get, muting players has never been easier.

That being said, CS:GO is a solid entry in an excellent franchise for new and old players alike.",1479927264,1707675179,True,0,0,0.540069699287414551,0,True,False,False

Communication between devs and community is nearly non-existent. Valve just needs to listen to the feedback and they can make Counter-Strike great again.

CS:GO was a great game with more game mode and a lot of map. There was more than 200 achievements and a lot of community maps.

There are very serios bugs week by week, a lot of cheater and I am still missing the great game modes and maps.
And in 2024, I have to open ports on my router, to play with my friends. Really? With CS:GO didn't need that. You should develop upnp. It's 2024 now guys.
After a ~half year development, they've got us a new mode, with 2 maps. Great work guys .... no, not at all.

This is a work level for a team of 5 senior devs of some indie studio with deadline of 3-4 deadline at max. This is not a work level of a multi-billion $ corporation.

However, the game now feels way better than ever before, thanks to the improved netcode/hitreg, good positional 3D HRTF audio and better visuals.

But lack of new gameplay mechanics together with useless VAC-anticheat don't allow me to recommend this game.

Is it so hard to add ML anti-cheat trained with the tons of proven cases you have in your Databases, Valve? Come on.

CS:GO is a very famous game. Almost everyone has heard of it and considering how old it is I was always surprised by the continued popularity compared with modern giants such as CoD, BF, etc.

So recently I decided to try out the game (I owned it for a while before I actually started playing it). Instantly I can see why this is one of the few games that will last decades. CS:GO is a classic Close Quarters Battle game. It features a number of fun game modes (from deathmatch to hostage rescue), it has a lot of well designed maps (with news ones always being addded), and it has all the great weapons that every shooting video game needs.

However, one thing clearly marks this game far above its competitors: its mechanics. The game design and shooting mechanics offer ease of use, realism, and a learning curve which allows growth in skill as you play. It is a fine balance that has been perfectly executed, unlike many other shooting games I have played. Playing on small maps with no vehicles or other additions, the 'shooting' in this game is what defines it, and [b]what makes it the funnest combat game I have played.[/b]

Also worth noting is the community of this game, yesterday when I was on the server there were around 350,000. This game has the 3rd largest user base on steam and 86% of its 3 million reviews are positive which is phenomenal.

Lastly I would like to acknowledge the Dev team which somehow keeps updating the game even though it is nearly 7 years old and now free. And the updates aren't bug-fixes but new content!

EDIT: A long time later, with many more hours and much enjoyment gained: I will not change my positive review but I will add that the match making nowadays is quite poor.",1557647750,1707636258,False,0,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

However, Valve needs to crack down on the cheating and smurfing problem. This is a very hard problem to fix, and they only can do so much. I just wish the community was not as toxic.

Edit (now at 2k hours): Still a great game. Once you get into a good trust factor you rarely run into hackers/smurfs. I would love to see 128 tick servers and maybe even source 2 to come out. I wish valve communicated more with their player base, but it is part of their business model not to. Also I hope you guys bring back maps like cobble, aztec, etc. and put them back into the game. Maybe you guys could put them into a separate map pool or something. ALSO DON'T OPEN CASES IF YOU WANT SKINS. The best way is just to buy them off the market. If you want to have some fun and test out your luck go ahead but don't expect to get anything. If you do get a knife or a really low or high float item, make sure to check with someone trusted in the community for its price, or go onto a market place and check.

Rampant cheaters every other game, no new content, unbalanced elo loss and gain in premier, peeker's advantage, incorrect bullet registration related to ping differences, the list goes on. 

However, my love for this game never seems to fade. As tilted I am feeling hopeless playing with a cheater, or demotivated because open queue teammates have no mics or are toxic for no reason, that's the state of the game and I have to live with that. I hope Valve is cooking something up with new changes and bringing back Train and perhaps creating other maps for us to enjoy. CS has always been a great tactical shooter game with a need for precision, proper timing, and strategy to be good at. 

Back to the actual review, this is the game to play if you want to get into FPS games. It teaches you to control your recoil, and unlike many other FPS games such as COD and Apex, the less you move the better you shoot. That does not mean movement is unimportant in this game. I will argue is even more important. 

This game will push you to your mental capabilities and technical skills, and you will be rewarded when you win rounds no one thought you could. Even in this state the game is currently in, I will still 100% recommend it for anyone.

Edit (Feb 10, 2024): Valve released the first major update in CS2, and I must say it's in the right step forward. Reducing peaker's advantage, bringing new mechanics in the game such as smokes on shadow (even though it is quite buggy right now), and movable stickers and changes to the Zeus, are all changes that I see as for the better.

I question why I play this game every time I do, and I feel on the verge of quitting for good just as often.

CS2 early review: Well it's out, and it's dog crap, improving smoke and nothing else. And maybe, other players have had a different experience, but mine has been dog crap. The hit reg is dog crap. The performance on a high end PC has been dog crap. Overall, I was having a tough day, and then I stepped in dog crap.

Oh, and how about all those CSGO achievements you spent years working on and earning? Well they don't mean a damn thing anymore, since they're gone for good along with the game you might've wanted to continue playing, and you never had a choice.

I honestly had more fun with CS in the first betas, and then up to 1.5, where 1.6 and beyond never felt the same, and I've been hoping for that original feeling ever since. CS2 is not that thing, and it basically sucks in it's current state.

Edit 02/10/24: The BIG F'ING UPDATE is out, so the game HAS to be better, right? Nope. Hit reg has NOT improved, and I see a serious issue with data reg in general, where in fact the 2 times I decided to pick up a weapon towards the end of a round only to find that what I ACTUALLY DID AND SAW HAPPEN didn't actually happen, and I still had the same gun in my hand from 3 seconds ago. Of course this problem manifested itself in multiple enemies not receiving damage at all from clear hits over and over. This game is still a flaming dumpster of poop, even stinking when I'm not playing it.",1437797832,1707603796,False,0,1,0.45267486572265625,0,True,False,False

[Scene: The living room of the Banks mansion. Uncle Phil, Aunt Vivian, Will, Carlton, Ashley, Geoffrey, Jazz, and Hilary are gathered around the TV. The room is filled with anticipation as Uncle Phil prepares to play Exit Kun.]

Uncle Phil: [Holding the controller] Alright, everyone, it's time for me to show you how it's done. I'm going to conquer this game like I conquer the courtroom!

Will: [Grinning] Oh, Uncle Phil, you sure you're up for the challenge? This game's got more twists than one of your legal cases!

Uncle Phil: [Smirking] Don't underestimate me, Will. I've got the eye of an eagle and the reflexes of a panther.

Carlton: [Excitedly] Go get 'em, Dad! Show 'em who's boss!

Uncle Phil: [Proudly] That's the spirit, son.

[Aunt Vivian chuckles as Uncle Phil starts the game. The screen flickers to life with vibrant colors and quirky characters.]

Geoffrey: [Dryly] Oh, I do hope this game doesn't test your patience too much, sir. It seems rather... stimulating.

[Ashley and Hilary walk into the room, curious about the commotion.]

Ashley: What's going on? Is Dad playing another one of his video games?

Will: [Grinning] You got it, Ash. He's trying to conquer this one, but it's giving him a run for his money.

Hilary: [Smirking] Oh, this I have to see. Dad, don't break the controller this time!

[A few minutes pass as Uncle Phil encounters his first anomaly in the game, followed by another, and then another.]

Will: [Smirking] Looks like Uncle Phil's legal eagle eyes are struggling with this one.

Carlton: [Excitedly] Go, Dad, you can do it!

[Jazz interjects with his usual flair.]

Jazz: [Laughing] Yo, Uncle Phil, you're slower than a snail in molasses! Let me show you how it's done.

Uncle Phil: [Annoyed] Jazz, I've got this under control. No need for your... expertise.

[Jazz starts backseat gaming, offering unsolicited advice and commentary as Uncle Phil's frustration grows.]

Jazz: [Laughing] C'mon, Phil, you gotta be quicker than that! Even Carlton's dance moves are faster than your progress in this game!

[Will, Carlton, and Ashley exchange amused glances.]

Carlton: [Whispering to Ashley] Dad's got this, right? He's just warming up.

[Geoffrey maintains his composure, observing the chaos with his usual dry wit.]

Geoffrey: [Sipping tea] It appears the game has proven to be quite the challenge, much like trying to teach a fish to ride a bicycle.

[Uncle Phil's temper reaches its boiling point as Jazz continues to tease him with his antics.]

Uncle Phil: [Furious] That's it! I've had enough of your nonsense, Jazz.

[Without hesitation, Uncle Phil strides over to Jazz, grabs him by the waist, and hurls him through the nearby open window.]

Jazz: [Screaming] Uncle Phil!

[The room falls into a momentary stunned silence as Jazz sails out of sight and crashes onto the lawn outside.]

Will: [Laughing] Classic Uncle Phil move!

[The family bursts into laughter as Uncle Phil closes the window with a satisfied smirk.]

Uncle Phil: [Smirking triumphantly] Now, where were we? Ah, yes, conquering this game like a true champion.

[The family settles back, enjoying the spectacle of Uncle Phil's gaming prowess, as the screen fades to black.]

(Verse 1)
Every now and then
I get a little bit lost
In this maze I can't figure out

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit confused
Spotting anomalies without a doubt

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit anxious
That I'll miss the exit, oh what a plight

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit frantic
But then I spot the clue in plain sight

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I miss the mark
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then
I miss the mark

(Chorus)
And I need a hint tonight
And I need a clue more than ever
And if you only guide me right
We'll be finding the exit forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be lost

Together we can navigate to the end of the line
Your guidance is like a compass leading all the time (all of the time)

I don't know what to find and I'm always in the dark
Searching through a puzzle and making some sparks

I really need a hint tonight
The solution's gonna start tonight
(The solution's gonna start tonight)

Once upon a time I was finding my way
But now I'm only getting led astray
There's something I can't see
A total eclipse of the clue

Once upon a time there was light in this game
But now there's only spots that look the same
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the game

(Turn around, bright eyes)
(Turn around, bright eyes)

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know I'll never crack the code
You always wanted to hide

(Turn around)
But every now and then
I know I'll always be the one
Who'll seek the path that's deep inside

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's no easy exit
As tricky and mind-bending as you

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's no challenge greater
There's no other game I'd rather pursue

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I miss the mark
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I miss the mark

(Chorus)
And I need a hint tonight
And I need a clue more than ever
And if you only guide me right
We'll be finding the exit forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be lost

Together we can navigate to the end of the line
Your guidance is like a compass leading all the time (all of the time)

I don't know what to find
I'm always in the dark
Searching through a puzzle and making some sparks

I really need a hint tonight

(The solution's gonna start tonight)

Once upon a time I was finding my way
But now I'm only getting led astray
There's something I can't see
A total eclipse of the clue

Once upon a time there was light in this game
But now there's only spots that look the same
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the game

A total eclipse of the game
A total eclipse of the game

The game can still fun for casual experience, but has a lot of broken parts which spoil said experience.

Especially considering that before CS2, we had CSGO that ran just fine and didn't make it so that the performance goes on to have ""bad trip"" after an update.

I'm glad that Arms Race has made its way back into the game after almost a year of waiting, but not having monastery or lunacy available to play on is... rather disappointing.

Like why are these people limited on what they can buy. Do these Ts and CTs need to have specific licenses for each weapon and can only carry so many on them at a time? It just doesn't make sense from a gameplay or lore perspective. Adds nothing, limits everything.

Worst of all is they are almost always premade with somebody to farm XP/score so the enemy team can't even kick them so you just have to sit there and wave goodbye to your promotion that took hours to get to, cheaters on Competitive i don't mind so much since it is pretty much casual 2.0 gamemode now and enemy team will more likely kick the cheater if they are solo q since nobody seriously cares that much about map rank because of Premier.

Why does the slaughter of chickens matter? We sit here, quarantined during a global pandemic and separated from our friends and family, as we can only watch as our elected politicians ignore the pleas and needs of the people. We can only watch as they plunder the United States of her riches and we careen towards a recession on par with the Great Depression.

-Additionally CS2 causes my computer to consistently crash while playing. Don't have this problem with other games. Eventually having my computer blue screen permanently during a CS2 match when one of these crashes occurred.

counter strike always was THE game for me, i have close to 10k hrs in css, csgo and cs2, but it seems it ends right here. i'll pause for a year or so and maybe it will change to the better. if not, im done with this crap.

The release and update to CS2 has been more than underwhelming at most,

1) Increasing the need of compute resource to run Valve's new source 2 engine, albeit better has killed majority of the players on low end gaming personal computers of the past.

2) The removal of past achievements tied to CS:GO was disheartening to watch as a singular global achievement sits at the very pedestal of what memories it used to hold.

3) As a fairly new replacement of the counter-strike franchise, it has failed miserably in porting and migration of the vast maps and game modes it had carried in it's predecessors wake. Taking it several months before the official release of match download was available (Disappointing for a ""Competitive"" game).

4) Fall of Anti-Cheat, Hype buzzwords of AI to deem an upgrade to anti-cheat is marketing sham at best. As someone who worked in Data and AI industry, you run into common problem of zero-shot learning (data-less learning) to identity new cheating behavioral patterns.

After putting years of my life into this game. I can say truthfully, that this game is quite fun. Playing games with friends has always been a must for me. Without friends, I don't think I would have put so many hours into this as I have. Most community servers are good for a laugh and the Competitive gamemode is mostly filled with nice players.

However. The main downside to this game is the community. Though the game is fun to play with friends and good overall community gamemode servers. Both official Competitive and Casual modes are (in my opinion) unbearable. The toxic nature of these games has pushed me away from playing as of late. But I wouldn't blame that for me loosing interest in the game.

Overall. CSGO is a great game to have a mess around on with friends and for a quick fix of Competitive gameplay. My only words of wisdom regarding this game, is be ready to mute a lot of your team in Casual matchmaking.

EDIT2: They have still yet to implement any of the changes that we have been asking for, still no maps from csgo, netcode still runs like garbage allowing insane peekers advantage, hitboxs still do not seem fixed in the slightest and still a huge cheater problem (possibly worse than CSGOs) i still don't recommend the game to anybody wanting to start off or any returning players

CSGO:
Pros: Fun game, simple goals and huge player base; Lots of skins and content.

Cons: Ranking system is useless until MG3+; Hackers common at lower ranks; far too many smurf accounts.

That being said; Comp play is exceptionally difficult at lower ranks due to so many people having multiple accounts and general salty people that think they're pro. The plus side to that is that it's hilarious hearing them sound off and get mad.

It has been they competitive first person shooter. This is not mindless arcade call of duty(post cod4 promod) style. It is almost as much of a mind game as a mechanically intensive ""Easy to learn. Hard to master"" mantra that Valve seems to like so much. 
    I will not be speaking of the more casual players that only plan on playing respawn game modes or 10v10's. I will be speaking for people that enjoy playing games in a competitive format that are willing to learn and put time into games with high skill caps.
      here is a fair warning, if you hate not being the best at something, this might not be the game for you. You have to put a lot of time into this game to be good. I have almost 800 hours on this game at the time I am writing this review, and I am Legendary Eagle in the rankings, and I still think that I am not good at all. Most of the pro's have been playing the counter strike series for almost ten years or more. So be prepared to never be the best if you are starting now.
   
  I wrote that back in 2015. I now have around 3.5k hours across all my accounts. Though there are many good things about the game, there are better options in 2024 for the north american community. Cheating is still plaguing the game 9 years since I started playing if you want to just boot up the game and  play a few games. The community is so toxic and I can't play it outside of a 5 stack anymore. The new premier matchmaking system also needs a ton of work. You would be better served playing valorant for a 1 to 1 replacement, not that val is perfect by any stretch. I can not recommenced getting into the game as a new player.",1450622286,1707442595,False,0,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Its intense gunplay, strategic depth, and vibrant/vulgar community keep players coming back for more, year after year. But everything changed with the arrival of this fateful update ‚Äì the update that shattered the dreams of its loyal fan-base, ""A Call To Arms"".

It began innocently enough. The developers promised a major overhaul, teasing new features, improved gun models, and exciting gameplay tweaks. Players eagerly awaited the update, THEN, it happened.

Excitement turned to disbelief, and disbelief turned to outrage. The once-beloved game was unrecognizable. The entire sticker system has been changed in ways that disrupted the delicate balance of sticker crafts. It was re-balanced to the point of absurdity, turning once-reliable crafts into useless toys.

The community erupted in protest. Forums and social media platforms became battlegrounds as players voiced their discontent. Some demanded immediate rollbacks, while others called for heads to roll within the development team.

But the worst was yet to come. Behind the scenes, whispers spread of more sinister motives behind updates that are yet to come. Rumors swirled of corporate greed driving the decision-making process ‚Äì of developers pressured to prioritize profit over player satisfaction.

And so, the saga of Counter-Strike 2's bad update served as a cautionary tale ‚Äì a reminder of the delicate balance between artistic vision, corporate interests, and player satisfaction in the ever-evolving world of gaming.
