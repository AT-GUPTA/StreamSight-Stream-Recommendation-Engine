Honestly...This game just isn't for me, I guess. Compared to like, Xrd, it's slower, simplified. Plus, I've heard a few horror stories about the matchups and whatnot. Not to mention that a [i]certain controversy[i/] happened. Or the fact that it's still ongoing with little to no neutrality. (It's pretty much both sides atp, don't tell me otherwise.) And it doesn't help that he character in question is almost everywhere at this point. That in itself just kinda...put me off this particular game in general. (I'd go as far to say the character's Guilty Gear's Neco-Arc in probably the worst way possible. But enough of that bs.)

I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm sure the game has its audience. (I mean, obviously. Have ya seen the reception since launch?) But, you gotta admit, the mechanics are a bit dull (albeit better, as of Season 3), and frankly, it feels like it's main appeal is the visuals rather than the game, not so much both at once. (Though, in that regard, I guess that's why the likes of BlazBlue exists.) Still, I guess this, all of this, is inevitably what happens once something enters the mainstream. It starts to get degraded, slowly. More so just eye candy while most of its identity just gets thrown under the bus.

And yeah, I get it, it's accessible and whatnot. But...Is that really worth it...? And maybe these words are just...meaningless.

Truthfully (and hate me if you want), if I do get this back, it's mainly for the cosmetic mods. But, as it stands, this game just doesn't do it for me. I'm sorry. (But sorry isn't enough, is it?)",1708653300,1708653300,False,0,0,0.398773014545440674,0,True,False,False

Please make everyone as fun as Happy Chaos, it doesn't have to do with how good he is its more to do with how many options and routes he has
Also instakills please

Edit: Asuka and Happy Chaos are the only dope characters in this game, and they're both zoners. Coming back to give this a negative because i feel it lacks the exciting options and flair of accent core and Xrd, so playing this game after a session of the past games just makes the experience feel bland. The UI is off with no real metal/rock feel, the screenspace feels congested, and the higher emphasis on strike/throw takes away from some of the decision making that was unique to the guilty gears of the past (not to say the past games didnt have some strike/throw to them, just less so).
Also, still no instakills, even though the game moves extremely fast, they were a super fun casual draw to the game with cool animations, so its a shame to see them go in preference of keeping the game more ""esports"" and ""easy to pick up"". A lot of these factors build together to making strive feel less substantial, I dont see much reason for coming back to this game anymore past visuals and a few characters (Characters new to strive, typically, because they feel less restricted from a game design standpoint).

You can also get Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 for really cheap on sale, which is super good too since it has unique mechanics like instant kills, Sol Dragon Install, and some weird ass characters like old Bedman, Slayer, and old Ky. GGST traded these for a more straightforward approach to fighting games, and while I prefer GGST, there is certainly a more casual and silly appeal to the older game (although it can be competitive too)
Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R is another GG game, but I found it to be a little too competitive-feeling and confusing. The graphics and music also felt much less appealing. It's super cheap on sale as well, though, so it is certainly an option. Whatever you do, I really recommend you don't get the original Guilty Gear, since it's basically a joke game",1708035311,1708035365,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have over 600 hours in the game. I've played in offline tournaments for the game with friends and at major events as well. The characters I played the most are Nagoriyuki, Sol, Anji, Axl, and Faust. My highest elo rating was around 1750 from ratingupdate.info, which places me near the top 2%. I could usually beat the average Celestial player but would rarely beat the best / professional players. At the time of my purchase, this was the only fighting game I've played. I started by using an X-Box 360 controller briefly, then a PS4 controller for the majority, my keyboard briefly, and then finally a Hitbox.

I really can’t describe what it is I don’t like about this game anymore, but I’ll do my best. My taste for fighting games in general has definitely changed over time, but so has this game. It’s hard to tell which between the two is shifting my perception the most, but it’s impossible to separate them. As such this review is probably a lot more subjective than what I’d like.

I think the skill required to be a strong player in this game has changed over its release. It’s not that I find it less skillful, it’s more that it’s just different than what I think is impressive. Though to be honest, I feel it has become less skillful overall. I don’t get that impressed seeing a strong GG:ST player anymore. Obviously they’re a lot better than me, but I just don’t think this game at a high level is that interesting or exciting anymore. I don’t see those big, flashy, risky outplay moments happen as often. The power level in this game has gotten too high and it restricts a lot of decision making. Every character now just feels so repetitive and predictable. A majority of the roster is just such a poor time to play against.

I used to watch all the major events for this game, but now whenever I do, I just feel so jaded and annoyed. I’m usually disappointed with the win. There’s always parts of competitive games that I find frustrating, but in this game they’ve been easy enough to overcome or ignore. You must understand that I have over 600 hours in this game and it’s the first fighting game I’ve played. Obviously, I’ve encountered a lot of challenges and hurdles learning this game, but I’ve faced the same things everyone else has in this game. My complaints aren’t about the challenge. These frustrating aspects were never a problem before, but now they are.

I don’t enjoy my time with this game anymore. I strongly dislike it. However, my time spent with it was incredible and it was truly some of the best moments I’ve had playing video games. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it anymore. I don't think I'd have the same positive experience I did if I were to pick the game up now for the first time. The fighting game I play the most now is Street Fighter 6 and while I think it’s a considerably better game, it doesn’t have the luxury of being my first experience with fighting games. As such, Guilty Gear: Strive will always be one of my favorite games ever, even if I don’t enjoy it anymore.

Sorry to say I can’t recommend it.",1706217967,1707889809,False,2,1,0.473865211009979248,0,True,False,False

Was great until season 2 with mediocre character releases and long periods of silence, come season 3 still with mediocre character releases + new mechanics in the game now that throws 'guilty gear simplified' out the window; currently the biggest anime fighter with 2nd best netcode behind SF6, it is still a great game but many people have moved onto SF6 or tekken 8 or just better games out there. Arc has also been doing smaller adjustments infrequently, the game is nearing its end of life span.

Storymode cutscenes were terrible as there were strange pauses between the lines delivered, audio volume was different among characters, some definitely more louder than others; Characters seize all movement during cutscenes and freeze...movements are stiff as heck, resulting in a very unnatural/uncanny cutscene. I don't know how the animators got an OK sign with this level of quality tbh (any other game, the characters have little movements even when they don't speak).
Arcsys shows they are not on par with this kind of storytelling with other major companies out there which is a shame.

If you are getting into this game in 2024, buy the basegame, but don't buy the season pass UNLESS you are sure.",1707720397,1707740245,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Just use your anti-air when she restarts her rekka"" Yeah that doesn't work cause after you hit them they can just use neutral slash and go back into it (For Happy Chaos at least you don't have the frames for any follow up. I'm not giving up my boy over one move). Cherry on top being that she has a zero frame, invincibility granting overdrive (can't even Romanian Cancel to block it). Even if you removed that Elphelt is still just a massive fuck you to new players. You could take a 4F sever and every other player is an Elphelt that spams the rekka. While more experienced players see this as a nuisance most new players don't know how to counter it. Maybe remove the ability to go back into it and just tweak her moves for a more competitive setting and this could be a good character. Right now however she sucks in competitive but destroys low floors. Also I've had a multitude of times when the game thought my roman cancel button was dust. No I did not fat finger, it does this in practice mode as well and I can see the lack of a dust input. Also some attacks hit high and low apparently so neither guard works??? 632146 is neutral (I have tension) and I didn't input any attack. Don't get me wrong I love this game but it really pisses me off when I input something and the game does something completely different. I also don't like how this game picks favorites (I miss point blank grabs while other people grab me from kick distance). On top of the gatling system being completely fucked, sometimes a move gatles into another sometimes it doesn't. Zero consistency on what moves can go into what and sometimes the game straight up discards inputs (Also steady aim broken, curse + steady aim means instant lock on but sometimes it misses anyway).

Pros:
Zato-1

Zato-1's luscious hair
Zato-1's thighs
Zato-1's absolutely bangin new moveset, bringing the bunga to a puppet character near you (only in select theaters)
Zato-1's straight up thiccc juicy thunder thighs
Uhhh I think there's some other characters in here too, that's cool I guess.
Oh, the presentation and soundtrack are fucking S tier. 

Cons:
the online is kinda janky and I don't like the more limited movesets compared to older titles, but I like most of the new characters and the game is still pretty fun, even if I prefer +R and Xrd.

On the surface, GGS looked to me like any other fighting game, with complex inputs and combos, in other words, something I would struggle to pick up and enjoy.
But really it only took me a few hours of doing the tutorial and practicing basic mechanics before i could start enjoying myself, first against bots, then against my friends.

The ceiling is still very high for me but it didn't take long for me to enjoy myself, and to feel like i had some decent understanding of the basics of the game.

I would totally recommend it, even for new fighting game players. It'll take a while to start really having fun with it, but that's true of most PvP games.

It unfortunately began to have server issues and rampant problems with ""hackerman"" during and after the various crossplay patches which is unfortunate. They tried to make the game better and somehow hurt it. Other than that the future is bright for this game I love it. However Dizzy has yet to be added to the game and that pains me.

11/28/22 Update. I now have 160 hours in on PC alone and another fat stack in on psn. Dizzy still isn't in the game (congrats to all the Sin fans btw) BUT I am having even more fun now! Finding weird interactions in the heat of a match then going back to the lab to replicate them never gets old. The soundtrack is still full of absolute banger after banger. I find myself no longer just floating between characters and instead I now have a main and a secondary (who will be my main eventually). They could fix some of the matchmaking issues and allow us to fish for 50 or 100 at a time though. But generally speaking I love this game and the majority of the community. If you are on the fence just come on over. There is something here for the casuals and the strivers looking to get better.

10/2/22 Update. I now have about 160 hours in between psn and pc. Went to my first tournament yesterday and placed 9th with a 4-2. Dizzy still isn't in the game and I float between multiple characters. No game has brought me as much joy as I've found in Strive. Win or lose as long as I'm not playing a random using that scuffed ""Ethernet"" cable hooked up to their local smoke shop I'm having fun.

Still no Dizzy but I can be a moe demon with yo-yo's I'd sell my soul to. Yeah I bought the dlc on PSN too what about it?",1660239765,1706903826,True,4,0,0.531878411769866943,0,True,False,False

The art style is really nice and the character design is great. Each character feels unique and unlike most games I was easily able to find several characters that I enjoyed playing (Nagoriyuki, Ramlethal, Testament, Giovanna, Ky). Music is pretty good too. 
Gameplay is pretty fun. It's super satisfying to learn all the moves of your character (except for the Z move-I can't do that one) and attempt to kill the Faust player. I suck at fighting games but it's still fun to play with friends. Really appreciate that you can play local multiplayer because that's the only way I've played it.
This is probably tied for my favorite fighting game (with smash) even though I am not good.

If u look at the earlier game's , yes this one was way simplified but it's not exatcly a bad thing.Alot new player's can enjoy it , as average combo's are around 4 hit's long , so u don't have to spend half of ur day labbing just to play. U can ofc make longer combo's by the use of mechanics or trapping someone in the corner.
Speaking of unique mechanic's , u have ""Dust"" (which let's u launch opponent in the air and do massive dmg combo's to them) , reflect shield , wild assault and roman cancel (let's u slow down time , so u can get away from being hit or extend ur combo!).
Artstyle is SO BEAUTIFUL , daisuke has a rlly original artstyle , u can especially see it in the older art.Which rlly works with characters who are very unique aswell and had allot passion , love put into them! It does have one downsite , which is they look super unconnected during cutscene's. Music is also super good! , I listen to allot of the track's from the game cuz they are just so energetic and metal!
In general I have rlly fun time with the game and despite it's few downsite's I think it's rlly worth a try ,even if ur experienced with fg's. Everything about this game is energetic and fun. I even started labbing combo's cuz of it and Im ready to try little harder games in the future. Thank you Daisuke for this game!

A tale unfolds, fierce and bright.
Guilty Gear Strive, a love untold,
A symphony of passion, a story to behold.

Within the pixels, fighters dance,
Each move a verse, a sweet romance.
Sol and Ky, like stars aligned,
In battles fierce, their destinies entwined.

Arcane forces, a tempest's embrace,
In the heat of battle, love finds its place.
May the echoes of our clashes resound,
As we navigate this battleground.

Ramlethal's grace, like petals in the breeze,
A beauty unmatched, bringing foes to their knees.
In every swing, in every slash,
A love story written in each thunderous clash.

Faust, with his scalpel, mends and heals,
A quirky love, where laughter peals.
In the strangest places, connections thrive,
A testament to love that can survive.

Anji and I-No, melodies in the air,
In the chaos of battle, a love affair.
The strings of fate, they pluck and play,
A harmonious union that won't fade away.

May our battles be fierce, our hearts aflame,
In Guilty Gear Strive, where love's the aim.

Our love story in pixels, forever will abide.",1705835134,1705835134,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No you shouldn't buy it. 
You're too late, the game is managed horribly, low population(with crossplay), and a bad online systems of sunken cost fallacy nonsense. Which the low population exasperates HEAVILY imagine one instance 32/32 and the other instance is 2/32. WOW WHAT A GREAT SYSTEM. (A general pool system like any other fighting game does would resolve this and brings variety)

Also when it Fatal Errors which UE Games do randomly, it will make your PC unusable until the game finally closes after like 3 minutes. Garbage.


Most of the cast is boring to play and play against. Bridget was brought in to bait and pander non fighting game players to buy the game oogle him then never play again. Easy sales! (This is a insanely objective of a statement in case you have zero friends and acquaintances to garner this data, Testament had no where near the pandering power Bridget did and it shows) 
And the money is all it's about obviously, to the point they delay a CRITICAL network patch to fix the online and wait to push it with the new paid for character. What a hilarious joke. Are they that broke they can't pay for certification of a patch for consoles?
The game is unplayable most of the time, magically you'll get matches, then suddenly you'll be soft-locked from the lobby and have to restart the game to get matches again.

The balance is boring, there's characters that are designed around having the most unfun interactions possible of pure guessing diceroll garbage which the rollback frames shaving off startup of moves certainly doesn't help identifying any of that nonsense. 
There's characters that Arcsys RED have no idea what the hell to do with. They can't seem to figure out how to balance Nago and Ram. They just made Nago take more damage when the player using him is being an idiot (doesn't help in actual proper matches) and due to this character and how they work, the general strategy of what to do against Nago? Don't do anything is the best thing you can do, very engaging! His win condition is existing! And Ram is just an example of balancing off the worst player's. They have no idea how awful it is to play against Ram, they just see bad rams lose and buff her. She used to be a god in the corners, and slightly below average mid screen. NOW she's a god at all parts of the screen.

And the general characters like Happy Chaos, who even enjoys playing against that character? A complete failure of a character slot.
Bedman is plagued by horrible design of just moves that get covered by horribly flashy effects and a useless character in the FOREGROUND walking infront of him and you, constantly just getting in the way visually. You can get a mod to remove the character but that doesn't solve the console players being plagued by it, does it?

There's this whole useless ranking system that is just extremely exploitable and completely binary in how it works. It doesn't account for anything other than ""did you win? did you lose"" It doesn't care about the player you played against or anything about them.
This is where everyone plays on Floor 10, the highest floor you can pick as ""deranking"" doesn't mean anything. But oh man what about Floor 11? That horribly useless vanity floor that requires the most absurd requirement I've seen in a fighting game.
You have to 5-1 someone in celestial floor to become a ""VIP"" which basically means you're locked to it and floor 10.
So I'll laymans what this means. You have to basically beat someone worse than you. Not evenly matched, not better. WORSE than you. To get VIP. What kind of prestigious value does that even have? Anytime you see a VIP RCode you can infer simply ""oh he bodied someone who couldn't fight back"". Cause that's how you get in. There's no ""I won the set I get in"" You have to obliterate someone in a set. AND THEN win a set like normal.

VIP should just be 2-1/4-2 requirement. Not 5-1. What the hell is this nonsense? Did they design the floor visually first and think ""wow 5 stars sure looks pretty, lets do something with that!"" It resets every month anyway so what's the point of trying to get into it if you'll randomly get tossed out? They removed being locked to Floor 10 so now you can just randomly go (AS A PREVIOUS CELESTIAL PLAYER) down to floor 8 arbitrarily trying to populate lower floors cause everyone sits at floor 10 but this has the negative problem of players just harassing newer players. 
As well as just being annoying as anytime you go to Floor 10 (where you belong) and got an unlucky streak against a Nago or something and have floor 8 or 9 as your lowest, it will constantly ask ""oh the floor 10 people so scary"". Like bro I've been in Celestial, I've beaten floor 10, why are you taking an extra button press now arbitrarily.

It takes them a year just to fix fundamental technical problems with their game(which there's still problems that are known). What confidence you have of them improving anything with the game itself?

There's just no hope for this game, they'll just make it worse, their idea of better defense mechanics is to have yet another spending of resources this time of your burst gauge in this next upcoming update. Wowee can't wait for that to basically do nothing like YRC. Inbred designers.
Can't even fix the FD bug, your bandaid patch was a FD button that most people won't be able to fit on their stick.",1623737302,1705800460,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Whether it's picking the wrong game (I started with Accent Core +R and then Melty Blood AACC, both of which are extremely difficult games with very good player bases), whether it was just the unfamiliarity with basic system concepts (holding back to block instead of just pressing a button, up also being jump), I never got into it.

Then, one day I saw that Strive was on sale for 50% off. I thought, hey, I got a big paycheck recently, why not try it out? Even at its worst the OST goes hard and I've only heard like a third of it.
I never looked back since then.

At its core, Strive is a game you can UNDERSTAND. People might say it's an easy fighting game or that it's for babies, and they might be right to some extent but nothing changes the fact that anyone can pick up Strive, fuck around in the tutorial for like 2 hours and UNDERSTAND the game mechanics. Of course, all of this didn't make me good; I'm still hovering between floor 7 and 9 these days, but nothing can take away just how much enjoyment Strive has provided for me over the last couple months.

If you're thinking of trying a fighting game and you're willing to spend some money on it, buy Strive when it's on sale. You will not be disappointed.",1705765714,1705765714,True,0,0,0.47397768497467041,0,True,False,False

Good things 👍:
• One of the prettiest games I've ever played. Absolutely gorgeous.
• Easy game to pick up, but extremely hard to master.
• Pretty big cast of characters, there's something for everyone.
• There's hot people around every corner, this game has triggered many a sexuality crisis.
• Just listen to the soundtrack, do it.
• Bridget.
• POTEMKIN BUSTER RAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad things👎:

• The lobbies honestly suck, it takes so much time to get into a game, and half the time it'll just break and send you back to the menu if you dare to try and play the game you paid for.
• Happy Chaos ._.
• It's so expensive, just wait for a sale honestly.
• ArcSys is a BUNCH OF COWARDS and they wont add my girl dizzy :(

What happened from launch to now?
Compared to Xrd, they stripped the flavor and removed a lot of the fun.
Whenever you fight anyone, it doesn't feel like you're learning because a tiny mistake and you lose 70% of your health and it's practically game-over from there no matter the skill level. Especially the overly-rewarded emphasis of over-powered offense and don't reward you for defense and playing smart.
It's a real shame that this was my first ever fighting game that I consistently played and the foundations of this game being exposed of simplifying it too much and the power creep with the DLC and general balance.

After playing this game endlessly on PS4, rebuying it for PC to then eventually play after coming back from a considerable break, and learning of both the history of Guilty Gear and the new path paved by Guilty Gear Strive, I have come to the conclusion that this is not the masterpiece it once seemed to be. In fact, it's the complete opposite; it's a cancer, the beginning phase for the end of the humble, passionate Arc Systems of olden times.

Although I first thought this was nothing to worry about, the further I grow in maturity the further I began to realize the terrible truth. It only got more terrible, and now I've reached the end of my GGST phase, and it unfortunately resulted in this bad review.


= Neutered and Unhealthy Gameplay =
Although pretty fantastic for newer players, the gameplay has quickly devolved into Flow Charting due to lack of depth, and the Rank Tower doesn't help at all. The intention behind the new gameplay was to allow players to learn ""without practice"", which sounds amazing at first, but then you realize the result: literally zero depth.

Autopilot is rampant in the game as a lot of interactions become optimized very quickly, and since almost every decent player is in Celestial, all those who are slightly below average are facing almost the exact playstyles over and over again. All of the creativity is locked behind a pretty door, so you're fighting flowchart after flowchart below Celestial, which results in you using the same 3 counters against everyone, which eventually turns you into a flowchart as well. It just got boring.

Open Park was better since you could fight anyone, but even then the game got stale. The top of this game is reached fast, which kills long-term enjoyment quickly. Wish the game had more substance, which it continues to receive, but never quite perfects the game. I loved the gameplay until the honeymoon period ended. Now? It's a repetitive bore.


= Bridget, Retcons, and Crappy GGST Story =
Okay, we're gonna get controversial here, so I'll start with something easy: the finale of Guilty Gear. Simply put, it was super underwhelming. Story mode looks shit, which you get used to, but the fact the game sells it like it's some cinematic wonder is just so dishonest. Remember the dishonesty because that comes back later. GGST could have had something amazing with the story mode, but all of the budget went into the game, which is nice for gaming, but that's still a massive L for story mode. The fact this is the FINALE is so shocking; felt like the middle of an anime, not the end.

Now, let's get to the controversy: the horror of modern Bridget.
Holy crap this character was destroyed. Such a lob, not because trans, but because that's all he is now: trans. The fact people like this character shows just how empty the whole movement has become, and that needs to be said even if people think it's transphobic. I'll get flak for this, but I'd rather it be me and not a weaker soul.

There's a great video by someone named Dimitri Monroe regarding modern Bridget. If you want a good idea on why ""she"" sucks, watch him. Long story short, like Testament, Bridget is trans because... money I guess. People hated Bridget when he was a trap, but now that he is trans, everyone loves him. Why? Idk, cause trans! Yippee!

The OG story was that Bridget left the village in hopes of returning one day and revealing the truth that he was a dude, but that wasn't gonna work by itself so he thought treasures would make it better. Story never really wrapped up beyond that, but GGST was gonna be the finale, so maybe Bridget would finally get to be the boy he was denied from being? That would be beautiful, right?

No, he's trans now.

So, the new story is that, Bridget, who was forced into being a girl or else HE WOULD DIE, went off on a journey to hopefully return treasure to his mean village and be accepted for who he really was, but while he was out, he just gave up and accepted being a girl. So, once she returns, the village welcomes her and the money and doesn't change. The end!

????? 
What??????

Just terrible direction for the character, and it definitely was only done for publicity, and sadly, it worked. Everyone loves Bridget cause trans and that's it. No character, no moving backstory, no resolution that everyone looked for; just a retcon and a middle finger. GGST devs were going back and forth about the canon behind Bridget being a girl or a boy, and, after a failed attempt to gaslight the audience into believing Bridget was trans all along (yes, they really said that), they just admitted it was a retcon and accepted the reality of character assassination. Very disappointing to then learn that everyone loved the retcon, which is just awful. So, so awful.

They don't love Bridget, no, they love what they want to be Bridget. They are just like the mean village; forcing a boy to be a girl, lest they be abandoned otherwise. Disgusting, immoral, and horrific.


= Crappy Initial Content and AWFUL Prices =
I've already written a lot, so I'll make this quick. The launch character and map roster were bad, but when Red Team got some content out, they put it behind a paywall. A large one too. This had been an issue with Fighting Games forever now, the only okay exceptions being Tekken 7 and SSBU since they both had insane rosters on launch, which really made the DLC roster not required for a good roster. That's not the case with DDFZ, GBFV, BBTAG, and now GGST. All of those games started small and made the acceptable content required to be bought with a hefty price. Terrible, greedy, and anti-consumer.

Sadly, most of the gaming sphere has become unbelievably expensive with negligible reward. If they don't have stupidly expensive DLC, they're built on lies and overhype so gamers can buy a $60 dollar piece of garbage. CoD, OW2, Starfield; almost everything nowadays is guilty to a degree, including this Gear... who is Guilty... and Striving...

Too much money, not worth the buy. The pitiful map roster makes the map DLC feel required, and to top it all off, 10+ extra colors for all characters are locked behind a paywall. Xrd had like 20 free colors per character alongside secret colors, while GGST only has 5. Impressive... if you were 3 years old and this was your first original video game. For an entire company dedicated to fighting games? Yeah, that sucks. The fact they actually did do some work but locked it behind considerable paywalls reveals that it's all greed.

Oh, and speaking of greed...


= Why it all happened... LIES and GREED =
Every single one of these problems all come from the exact same origin; the wish for GGST to reach a wider audience. Why? Because money! Of course it is, because humble development is dead. Look everywhere in the gaming market; it's all greed, lies, and all for money. Passion is dead, it's been dead for a decade now.

Make the game easier so more people can play, which equals more money. Retcon characters and make them pure progressive pandering so more people will buy them, which equals more money. Make a terrible story mode and sell it as an amazing cinematic masterpiece so people will buy the game just for that, which equals more money. Oh, and to top it all off, make everything super expensive! Why? To make more money! Money, money, money, money, money!!!

That's all GGST is: a money machine. Whether or not I loved this game, it's clear what the purpose for GGST is, and I'll do my deed to make sure this doesn't get any more money than it already has. I've dumped 150+ already, wish I didn't. What I once considered a hopeful future for fighting games has now shown itself as the dark void that will turn fighting games into the cash cows the rest of the gaming market has become.

ggst from the very beginning had problems with lobbies and net play, but after 1.25 its become unbearable, don't waste money, wait till they fix that sht, [strike] jonny [/strike] boring elphelt released and its still unplayable 

big damage and simple blockstrings, in a game where defensive mechanics are plenty at first glance, but the more you play, it becomes clear that in fact defensive options are rather limited, makes flow of battle predictable

meter system. tension only has use in 50% (was 25% in previous titles), meter gain for attackers usually bigger than defender (not if the defender has significantly bigger HP, but that's another can of worms...), and with RC that basically eliminates risk of a failed attack and how some characters can explode risc gauge (cough, cough ...nago... cough ...) - we have a rather disbalansed and more ""party game"" experience, where some chars are loved by game systems (nago, HC, leo..) and some are forced to work against the game itself (pot, anji, milla...)

sometimes you feel like playing on 9f rollback but game telling that its only 1-2f (you can literally see one thing but hear other, not good at all), UI isnt greatest also, too many popup menus are very confusing to use (you need to open like 5-6 menus to get to follows or the like)

tutorials are very strange, on one hand there is a lot of information, but they are also often very restrictive in how you can tackle the presented situation (for example - when you being taught what to do against Briget cgrab, you are unable to attack at all, and able to jump only when move is used in mixup, but in reality you can just mash 5P or 2P on cgrab, so not being able to experiment on the spot to find all possible countermeasures is kinda sadge),they mostly don't let you try mashing or backdash (and those are often pretty good in strive),and that's limits your toolkit and approach options.Would be sweet if after you beat the mission withone option that was presented by tutorial, you can retry mission, but that time can use whatever means possible, instead of going and trying to wrestle with training settings to repeat that situation. so in essence most missions are quite meaningless.

arcsys patching is true to traditions - not touching top chars, shuffle mid chars a bit, buff some mid chars (but in such a way, so they won't become better still), and occasionally breaking some unfortunate random for no reason

in the end - strive is easy to start, stylish, and have a lot of ppl playing, but going deeper is full of flaws on a base level and is completely unbalanced.

honestly a lot of ppl online, probably only reason to play that disappointing mess of a game.",1648302243,1705362439,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My first suggestion is to start of with Sol and Ramlethal first. They're great characters, easy to use, and came during launch. Go straight to Arcade mode for each character to understand their story, it's way better than the actual story mode which you can watch it all on YouTube for free, and literally almost everyone in community recommends you do it this way. Buy the DLC you're completely invested or you want to have more variety, it's up to you. Online is great, but keep in mind, they're going to be people who will kick you ass, they had this game longer than you and I.

If you're old school GG Player, there have been a lot of changes. Some characters got a smaller move list or different move list (May, Faust, and Baiken). Some old and new characters are DLC lock (Sin, Baiken, Johnny, Bridget). Oh Yeah, everyone got a redesign either small or big (May, Faust, Elphelt, Testament, and Bridget). They're brand new characters in the game (Giovanna, Nagoriyuki, and Goldlewis), also That Man is now playable (Asuka-R).

Mods are great, I pretty sure they're one-way viewing. We got a lot of pervs in this community. Also a lot of LGBT supportive Community mod that are great, If don't like seeing that stuff and think it's gross, I get it. I just kindly ask you to leave *rack shotgun*, just not calmly. They're also a lot meme mods, like Ronald Sin, KFC Dickinson, everyone has Drip, that one Testament mod (You know the one, bro only has 6).

Overall I think the game is great, it's visually beautiful, with great voice acting, and has great game play. I highly recommend it.",1705021369,1705021369,True,1,0,0.52050471305847168,0,True,False,False

mods are also great, like toji fush from jjk being a mod for johnny, sussy shadow for zato as well as dio-zato (they share the same voice actor if you play in spanish dub), Sengoku Nadeko for ramlethal 

anyway great game, millia rage got me down bad

“Mankind knew they cannot change society. So instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the Beasts.”

Hostility is akin to love
Thinking of your opponent’s actions to fight,
Reading your opponent’s inner thoughts to fight,
Planning attacks that will hit your opponent to fight,
And then transmitting your thoughts with those attacks,
The more you think of your own advantage, at the same time you think of your opponent,
In the instant you mix with your opponent, a passionate feeling arises, and blood boils,
Reality is hurt, and you wound your opponent,
Hostility is akin to love.

The cutting-edge 2D/3D hybrid graphics pioneered in the Guilty Gear series have been raised to the next level in “GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE-“. The new artistic direction and improved character animations will go beyond anything you’ve seen before in a fighting game!

A testament to just how much effort went into making this game great is how they took the time to create an original theme song for each character lyrics and all, and they're all absolute bangers. All of the characters are so unique and creative both in terms of gameplay and design. Learning a new character feels like taking a whole new perspective on the game as a whole, and all of the movesets just feel great and look great. A personal thing that I dislike about the game however is how oversexualized the characters are and how pervy the community is lol, but I'm willing to pay the price cause this game is just awesome, me and my roommates have had great times playing this game up till 4 in the morning.

If you want an actual great PVP experience: Go play Tekken 7 or wait for(as of writing this review)upcoming Tekken 8, SF VI(if you can get over Crapcoms monetization and hope that you won't have online issues), GBFV Rising or give Blazblue CF a chance, although that is a ""Discord fighter"".

This game is an overrated pile of rubbish. This was my first GG game(not my first FG)and I got swept up to the hype train and I regret buying it. I played constantly from the release and I permanently flushed this game when Happy Chaos came out. This review is mostly from the beginning of the game to that point and idc if they have fixed some things, I've already had enough. Here are my reasons for not recommending this game:

- The online is a f*cking shit - show. The battle stations never worked properly since the beginning of the game. We all remember the connecting to the main menu and checking R - Code - shenanigans? Constant disconnects, laggy matches, 4K Counterhit slowdown bug, some stages run like @ss, hackers harassing streamers and many more other technical problems. Atleast they gave us a Wi - Fi indicator. The whole ranked tower is terrible and I know many people who have also said that why not just have a normal ranked queue. It's the traditional Arcsys special olympics poorly implemented lobby/battle station blues which they push to too many of their games.

- The gameplay just isn't fun and is way too offence oriented. The whole gameplay flow just feels obnoxious and watered down to a more simplistic degree compared to older GG games to attract more casuals. I don't have a problem with a long running fighting game series becoming more simplistic but you have to do it well, Strive misses the mark. Everyone does too much damage, rounds are over in an instant, the reversal window is fucked up, some characters just constantly keep attacking and you get a small to moderate punish if you hit them back while if you guess wrong you lose 70% of your life. The corner carry is absurd, worst offenders are Ramlethal and Nago. The fighting games I enjoy like Tekken, Soul Calibur, GBFV Rising and SF VI overall feel much more rewarding for mounting a good defence, this game is just braindead attacking. The whole corner wall break concept is just a deception for making players feel like they got out of the corner for a 2nd chance. In reality the positive bonus what the opponent gets is almost or just as bad as you being in the corner.  For those who care about SP content it's non - existent. Basic Bitch Arcade and a long story movie with zero gameplay.

- The balance is all over the place. This has to be one of the most unbalanced modern fighters I have played. Since the very beginning Sol had his notorious F.S and ""The Kick"", then we had the Nago deletes your lifebar in the corner - reign, Ramlethal is still an 10 IQ overtuned character and finally we got one of the most cancerous characters ever made in a fighting game: Happy Chaos. I rather watch paint dry on the wall than play against him. Every ""meta"" just felt like a tiresome chore to play. As for some weaker characters: They waited for a century to buff characters that needed those buffs or never tweaked anything. After twiddling their thumbs each season for too long they eventually nerfed or tweaked Sol, Nago and Happy Chaos, but I already lost my respect towards the games balance team who clearly don't know what they are doing. They don't know how to make the game balanced and fun for all skill levels which is 100% possible to do.

- Everyone circlejerks the OST like it's the best thing ever. It's not. There is 3 good songs(RotS, DoP and Hellfire)while the rest are either mid(e.g Zato, Johnny)or grabage(e.g Baiken(her older themes are 100x better), Giovanna, Elphelt, Ram). If you want good FG OST go listen to Soul Calibur, Blazblue, older Tekken, SF, KoF or older GG(When I heard X2 tracks after Strive music, Strive got absolutely smoked).

- I read the lore a lot, because this was my 1st GG game and the amount of pandering and virtue signaling to a certain obnoxious, unhinged and spastic group of people is borderline comical. Maybe it's partially because Daisuke got married and started to partake in the school of soy? Retconning Bridgets and Testaments whole backstories, making certain female designs more ""family - friendly""(i'm surprised Baiken didn't get censored)while Anji and Johnny are build - up like Adonises. They did all that but then they censored all mentions of certain areas from the in - game story glossary, you know what I'm talking about. Seems hypocritical to me. Look, I want my males handsome and cool and they can show skin as much as they want, but you can't tell me there is a double - standard and it just keeps getting worse and worse as a whole in video games. All these things for modern audiences who most likely won't even play the fucking game.

- And to comment on some of the new and re - desings overall: so much of them are lamer than the previous GG games. I like anime aesthetics myself, but I know that many GG fans didn't like the Xrd designs because they were too anime and I can respect that. I think the X2 and Xrd aesthetics are both miles better than Strive's. Ky Kiske, May and Elphelt went all from having unique fantasy clothes to wearing boring and uninspiring everyday clothing. Giovanna, a newcomer, has the same issue. Testament on the other hand had a more darker, simplistic look and now he looks like some over the top fashion model that tries to have more ""realistic"" clothing but just ends up looking ridiculous. No wonder the old characters that didn't get changed were the most well received, because why fix something that is already 10/10? If you want to re - design old characters atleast do it properly like for example Tekken.",1704057950,1704082253,False,4,0,0.486500382423400879,0,True,False,False

-Did I mention how much I dislike Elphelt Rekka already?

But past that, I continue to play and enjoy the game...even if I have to live with Elphelt Rekka still being in the game. After all, what would I be without my Baiken mommy and Mr. Dolphin daddy?",1703661939,1703720445,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It sits somewhere between street fighter and an anime fighter without being either. It feels slower and less fluid than any anime fighter while not as mechanically sound as street fighter. It just sits humbly betwixt. If this is fine for you than it's an impeccable game. But if you're looking for that streamlined combo flashiness of a Blazblue, than this ain't it chef.

Old part of the review [b]EDIT later[/b]:
Please don't buy this game, servers don't work, you can't match into any other players, lobbies will kick you out and have you restart the game just to disconnect again.
The game is actually unplayable in the literal sense of the word. You cannot play. You can try to matchmake, but you cannot play.

Here's the updated review.
The negative review stays but for absolutely different reasons.
This game started off pretty popular because it was actually very easy to pick up and play for an anime airdasher, featured (and still does) some simplified mechanics like gatlings are very short in this game or there is no airteching and there are only two kinds of knockdowns, soft knockdown and hard knockdown.
In the early days the lack of airteching was the only real gripe I had with this game because it essentially rewards players who can't do their combos since even after a dropped combo (a massive failure most of the time) leads to your opponent landing directly in front of you and giving you a so called meaty. This leads to no repercussions for people that play badly (very prominent in this game).

Nowadays I have only problems with this game
First of all balancing is out of whack and I don't mean it in a way that ""some characters are weaker and some are worse"" because every fighting game is like that, without exception.
The problem with this game is that the devs clearly have favorites that usually the community calls for nerfs so devs will usually try to address these characters and in a few months they will ""adjust"" these characters.
What that usually meant is they would write an entire article in the patch notes how they changed a move people had a problem with and then ""to compensate"" they would buff some other aspects of their kit.

This on paper makes sense, nobody likes their character to be nerfed, but what had happened in reality, usually the move that was nerfed, what happened to it for example: the hitbox usually was reduced by one pixel or the move was slowed down by one total frame and then the same move would get 5 different buffs and the rest of the characters' kit would get a lot of buffs too.
This made a lot of other characters play catch up and pretty much the entire cast with few exceptions kept getting only buffs (and what I mean by that, the favorites kept getting buffed, or as said earlier if the character wasn't liked by the community they got one nerf and 10 buffs to compensate, while some characters that weren't devs' favorites were just kept in the dust) and playing against any and every character feels like a chore and is very unfun.
This is what you would call a ""kusoge"" lit. ""shit game"" and to elaborate, almost all characters have such an insane power level they feel nothing like they did in patch 1.0 and not in a good way, they're all a knowledge check or have a way to shut you down completely meaning you can't really do anything once you lost neutral, or some characters being so oppressive, you pretty much lose as soon as you pressed ""start"" against them, unless you play equally as a top tier character.

I'm not sure if the server issue was addressed or simply the hacker attacks stopped, the game is playable now, albeit significantly less people to play with.
If you have a friend or two to play with, friendlies are still really fun to mess around in, but playing ladder it feels like taking ""fighting game"" to it's literal sense because it feels less like fighting another person and more like quite literally fighting the game.


If you want an alternative to a fun anime airdasher with rollback here is some equally or more kusoge games but they're either cheaper or more fun (or both), especially with friends:
[b]Blazblue Central Fiction[/b]

[b]Guilty Gear Xrd[/b] or [b]+R[/b] (all three are also from Arc System works)

[b]Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code[/b] or [b]Melty Blood Type Lumina[/b]

[b]Under Night In Birth II Sys:Celes[/b] as of writing this review is coming out soon (the three mentioned here are from France Pan and the movement is very satisfying in these games, Current Code is a kusoge through and through but is fun in friendlies (there is a rollback version of MBAACC outside of steam), Type Lumina is actually fairly easily approachable)

Not a lot of people play these games but tbf that can also be said about Strive nowadays as well.",1680984759,1703600100,False,6,1,0.493647515773773193,0,True,False,False

It was so easy to pick up, but there's so much to learn and get better at. I think it's a perfect first fighting game.

Additionally, this is what got me into Guilty Gear, and Guilty Gear is freakin' AWESOME. The characters, the story, the gameplay...it's easily one of the most underrated game series out there. Learning about the series and watching high-level gameplay videos has become a huge pastime of mine, and, as a game developer myself, I take a lot of influence from the series' approaches to gameplay balancing and character creation.

However, the peak of this already peak game is definitely the music. GGST's soundtrack is quite possibly my favorite OST of all time, which I do not say lightly, and is probably one of my favorite albums period. I'm serious, if there is any game to get into just for the music, it's this one. There isn't a single bad track on the whole album; sure, some are a little uninteresting, but they're intermixed with some of the greatest rock songs I've ever heard, songs written with passion and emotion that tie together this brilliant clusterfuck of a game.

I'd give it a perfect rating, but there are some pretty obvious flaws like annoying top tiers/balance and the dreadful online interface, so it'll have to settle for just nearly perfect.",1703439513,1703439513,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Good 2.5D graphic style, great artistic design, the characters look very nice. 

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead

Fun fighting game, very pleasing to the eyes, wide range of characters and more coming out for your own preferences. Each character is very unique, and playstyles vary.

---{ Audio }---
☑ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

The OST in this game is amazing if you are into hard rock music, playing a fighting game with this game's music pumps your blood and keeps you going and going. The previous Guilty Gear games' OSTs can be found by fishing, and they are all incredibly good as well.

---{ Audience }---
☑ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

Intense fighting game with large visuals, recommended for Adults and Teens to play online against other people and get better at the game, recommended for Kids only if they are gonna play offline against the CPU or against their friends, they probably won't have fun losing hard to some random person online.

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

Game doesn't seem to be taxing, however, you do need a pretty good PC to run this game.

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult

Game is designed to be very fluid and easy for a new player to learn.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

Competitive game, therefore, grind is only for rank and fishing collections/collectible items

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☑ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

There is a story mode, I never went into it as it is more of a light novel experience with animations, but I heard it is a pretty in-depth story.

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☑ To infinity and beyond

Competitive game, therefore game time is as long as the playerbase remains active.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☐ Worth the price
☑ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

Pretty pricey, but if the game is on sale and you like fighting games, definitely a must buy.

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved

There aren't that many bugs, but every now and then a bug is found on twitter that can be pretty game breaking.

They removed weight classes in the game and reduced complexity of the fighting game genre. As a result, I have permanently quit fighting games because of GGST.

Want to play the game with a character that always has four mixups but no kill potential? Play millia. Meanwhile Potemkin is able to single grab any character for over half Millia's health. At the end of the day, Anji Mito is the only honest character is this game, Ramlethal players can't stop drooling, Baiken players get a bad reputation, Sin Keiske players are predators irl.

The music, visuals, game play. All great, and is actually starting to feel a lot better because of changes made that I really like, such as wild assault and deflect shield which add more decision making with the burst gauge. I wish some things were different like words can not express enough how much I hate air dashing in this game, it feels like your flying through molasses before you get any momentum with a forward air dash and then the back air dash is just pathetic. While that's not my only complaints everything else I guess I don't despise that much. If you are someone new to the genre, I really do recommend! If you just take things slowly and play with the mentality of ""I want to improve"" You will get better.

-Damage is too high. You will die in 2 interactions most of the time. Even when you win, it will feel hollow, as more often than not, Rounds aren't won by outplays and sorta ""just happen"".....now try to imagine how you will feel on losses lol

-The wall mechanic. The guy who worked to put you in the corner doesn't get to benefit that much from his positioning advantage, as it's hard to not break the wall, making screen control feel less worth. The one who got cornered will still get messed up by the extra damage and positive bonus he's about to deal with. It brings nothing good to both players outside of cool looking stage transitions, just a hassle.

-Small move list for characters. It didn't bother me that much at the start, but you really start to feel a bit limited and bored after playing the same character for a while.

The story, the characters, the design change, the battles, the suspense, the thrill, everything packed right here in this game. As if Xrd didn't wowed me enough... Strive did made my cradle rock. 

PROS:
- Diverse characters, each with their own unique fighting styles;
- A design change that we, fans, didn't know was possible;
- Ongoing DLCs (Elphelt came to rock with us!);
- Engaging and touching music;
- Story is complex and well written;
- In Arcade, you can fight characters that you don't have as DLCs yet (I got a chance to fight against Testament Extreme Route - oh, happy (chaos) me!);
- English vocals and translations for great understanding (Thank you!);
- The game has trading cards and achievements.

NEUTER:
- Found out how to reconfigure settings to allow me to play with Keyboard Arrows! Yes!

CONS:
- My game is slowing down (lagging) at times. Could be the drives or the FPS. But the difference between the visual and the keyboard input is mere 2 miliseconds, so it's not bad. 

NEUTER:
- Fought with a friend in a private room, he/she was absolutely stunned that I play Strive with this low performance frame rate. (Boy/Girl, you should have seen me playing GGXX Accent Core Plus emulated on a Win 7 - it was waaayyy slower than this!)

With nearly 20 hours of immersive gameplay under my belt, I stand here in awe of the epic journey that awaits any intrepid adventurer who dares to traverse its sinister landscapes. Allow me to share my experience, which has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on my gaming soul.

The attention to detail is second to none, with hauntingly beautiful environments that simultaneously evoke a sense of dread and wonder. Every corner of this world pulsates with life, and the atmospheric graphics draw you in, making it impossible to escape its grasp.

The fluidity and responsiveness of the controls heightened my sense of empowerment, enabling me to effortlessly dispatch hordes of foes in a symphony of chaos.

But Diablo 4 is not merely about mindless hack-and-slash action. The intricate web of lore and storytelling weaves its magic throughout the game. Engrossing quests and captivating dialogue breathe life into the rich tapestry of Diablo's universe, introducing memorable characters and gripping narrative arcs that kept me invested and hungry for more.

The character progression system in Diablo 4 is a testament to its depth and replayability. As I honed my skills and unlocked new abilities, I felt a genuine sense of growth and evolution. The freedom to customize my character's playstyle and experiment with various builds added an additional layer of excitement, ensuring that no two playthroughs would ever be the same.

It would be remiss of me not to mention the cooperative multiplayer aspect of Diablo 4, which amplifies the experience to staggering heights. Joining forces with fellow adventurers, battling formidable bosses together, and sharing in the spoils of our conquests created a sense of camaraderie that is truly unparalleled.

In terms of longevity, Diablo 4 offers an expansive endgame that guarantees countless hours of enjoyment. From the challenging dungeons and raids to the endless pursuit of powerful loot, the game continually entices you to push your limits and prove your mettle. With future updates and expansions promised by the developers, the Diablo 4 experience promises to be an enduring odyssey.

In conclusion, Diablo 4 is an absolute masterpiece that has captivated my gaming heart. Its awe-inspiring visuals, addictive gameplay, immersive storytelling, and robust multiplayer elements combine to create a gaming experience that is nothing short of legendary.

The character designs are unique and diverse, with fighters that range from a looming doctor with a bag over his head and a scalpel shaped spear, to an anime girl who summons dolphins, to a witch with an electric guitar. They even got Saul Goodman in on the action. Additionally, there is trans/nb representation here in the form of Bridget & Testament (DLC fighters). I love to see it! 

The music is great too, with each character having their own theme. The gameplay is flashy, and the timings for motion inputs aren't too tight which means that I (a noob at fighting games) can still use them. The graphics often convincingly look like 2D animation, which is something that I love to see.

Horrendous powercreep as the devs try to one-up their previous handiwork with the new line of DLC characters, hideous lobby system that tries(?) to evoke pixel-art charm but looks more like a cheap shovelware 2D platformer, nonsensical bugs that at best prevent you from starting matches for no reason and at worst completely softlock the entire game, lop-sided ranked system that top-loads way too many players in rank 10, it's like I never left. What [i]is[/i] new is that they added a few new universal mechanics and some new moves to characters, but I saw precious little of these in my online matches, so that should give you an idea of how meaningful those additions were. My previous stance on this game remains the same: it's a frustrating, poorly designed (mechanically-speaking) game that manages to worsen over time, but not altogether unpleasant, especially if you have a high tolerance for bullshit. Original review below.

I have a deep love-hate relationship with this game. I love the incredibly diverse cast of characters; I hate how often I see some characters more than others (and I mean [b]way[/b] more than others). I love the way I can connect and play against others from across the world; I hate how the lobby system that you need to use to do this sucks complete ass. I love how some fights can be a brutal, nail-biting, adrenaline-pumping tug-of-war where it's anyone's game; I hate how [i]most[/i] fights are one-sided steamrolls where neither side really enjoys the game. While it's easy to see the vast number of upsides that Guilty Gear Strive has to offer, I cannot recommend this game for several reasons:
[list]
[*] [b]Character balance has been and always will be horribly broken[/b]. Starting with perhaps the most egregious fault of GGS, the character balance. There are characters who are objectively strong in all circumstances with few drawbacks. There are characters that have historically been incredibly weak, regardless of the laundry list of mundane ""balance patches"" since launch. Those that find themselves in the middle of this dichotomy often are nominally balanced, except for the one attack in their moveset that is [i]wildly[\i] overpowered, meaning any player will spam that attack to great effect at very little cost. Everyone who plays this game knows this, and it shows every time I log into multiplayer and see the lion's share of players pick the same five characters, falling into the same type of playstyle, making online play very predictable and redundant. 
[*] [b]The lobby system is utter rubbish, and nothing has been done about it[/b]. This is another thing that has troubled the game since launch. For all the gorgeous visual style that GGS is famous for, Arc System Works made the baffling decision to implement a lobby system that is barely functional, unintuitive, and horribly ugly to boot. The number of times that I have been randomly kicked back to the title screen (not the main menu, the [b]title screen[/b]), denied a match with another player for no reason, denied the ability to queue up for a match, disconnected while in the middle of a match and kicked back to the title screen, soft-locked myself while trying to queue up for a match, loaded into a match before being disconnected before it could even begin and then immediately kicked back to the title screen, I cannot even begin to fathom. Despite claims of fixes in the multitude of patch notes since launch, the problems persist with no sign of abatement. And just for clarity, it takes a solid minute for me to go from the title screen to playing the game again. [b]EACH. TIME.[/b]
[*] [b]The DLC characters are just ridiculous, what were they thinking[/b]. Earlier I mentioned the abhorrent job ASW did at balancing the base characters in this game, but that is nothing to say about the trainwrecks of balance that are the DLC characters, which practically border on pay-to-win. Each new DLC, with the exception of Goldlewis, has added an objectively better character than most all of the base cast. More range, faster recoveries, higher damage, smaller hurtboxes; these characters lend themselves to a reckless and uninspired playstyle of spamming the same overpowered moves with impunity, knowing they will always have the advantage over anyone who plays any other character. You need only juxtapose Axl Low, a hardcore zoner with limited close-range abilities and okay damage who is available in the base game, and Happy Chaos, a hardcore zoner DLC character who deals mondo damage, has close-range abilities that can knock encroaching opponents back to the other side of the screen, generates tension meter by the truckload even when his attacks are blocked, effortlessly forces opponents to cautiously approach on penalty of losing all their forward progress, has a long-range spammable attack with very little downtime, AND a super that can hit literally anywhere on the screen. The difference is night and day.
[*] [b]If you're not a god at the game, ranked mode is extra depressing[/b]. ""Git gud to enjoy the game"" is an abysmal approach toward game design, but the geniuses at ASW have gone and done it anyway. For context, the ranked mode is a ""tower"" comprised of 10 levels, in a way ""roughly"" sorting everyone by skill level; beat enough people, go up a floor. Then there's a ""secret"" 11th level where you can ""earn"" the right to try and win 5 out of 6 games against players already in the floor to actually be able to regularly play there, but that resets each month unless you're so good your avatar goes super saiyan and catches fire (this is only a [i]slight[/i] exaggeration). There is a critical problem with this arrangement. Expecting a 10th floor player, which is already a pretty good skill level all things considered, to win 5 out of 6 games against objectively more-skilled players is ludicrous, because even if one was [i]evenly-matched[/i] against them, they would only win half of their matches on average; that's just basic math. For obvious reasons, no one can enter matchmaking for a floor that is lower than their current rank, but this means that anyone who is in floor 10 but cannot match into floor 11 can [i]only[/i] match in floor 10 and no where else. As a result, the 10th floor is overcrowded with players who likely have the skillset to go toe-to-toe with those on the 11th floor, but because of the obtuse rules toward gaining entry to match with such players, are forced to fight over and over on the 10th floor, often steamrolling those who are trying to earn entry into the 10th floor rank. It's an aggravating environment that does not accurately measure players' skills and frequently fails to generate enjoyable matches against evenly-skilled opponents, which signals a complete and utter failure to implement a ranking system.
[\list]

This is a non-exhaustive list of my gripes with all the horrible design choices in GGS, but it's all the points I feel are relevant for any prospective gamers looking into it. 250+ hours of trying my damnest to love this game, which I genuinely did for a time, have all converged into this depressing and pessimistic review warning all of its perils. And yet for all the complaints I have laid out, there is still a pretty good game buried under it all. Although all the hours I have sunk into it have left me jaded and disappointed, I am clearly in the minority, and even now I will admit the obvious: it's still a fun game. To anyone thinking of buying this game, think twice and please take the points I listed above into consideration, that's all.",1642734233,1702674581,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Got very decent soundtracks. If it's your first time playing a GG game go for it. If you played XRD before let me tell you something. It's different. At first you'll say ""eh, is it really worth it?"" Then you will start asking the real questions like, ""where is instakill?"", ""why are there so few special attacks/combos?"" and ""WHERE IS ELPHELT?"". Well, at first, I wasn't a fan of the game. Now? I love it. Returning XRD feels very different now but in a bad way. I love both games. They are both good but I'll keep playing Strive not XRD. The main reason is the playerbase. XRD is basically dead. After the rollback update it is better than before but still not enough. It aged and it shows that. Bought it and now I got no money. Do I regret it? No. Will I survive?

    Original, outdated review: I just started playing the game, but I already found a worthy man to call my eternal rival, a Ken to my Ryu, if you will. That man has beat me every time I opened the game, and I always find him waiting for me to start playing, and I can't deny him at least 5 minutes of my day whenever we meet. What's his name, you ask? Well, it's ""Communicating with server"", of course. 
     It's aggravating how you have to wait up to 5 fucking minutes just to play the game after you pressed start, and the constant disconnects, crashes, matches that straight up refuse to start, etc. make this feel awful to play.
     Furthermore, the game's combo mechanics feel like trash and the characters are shadows of their former selves, but the new RC is cool.
     As a guilty gear fan, I find it sad that I have to give the game a negative review, but it's simply not a guilty gear game at this point in time. Will change the review if it does get better.",1623468585,1702585042,True,0,0,0.524964690208435059,0,True,False,False

-Extremely Fun
-Very easy to pick up and learn
-Awesome cast with some convoluted but solid lore
-Hands down the best video game osts ever
-Amazing artsyle and animation
-Very active playerbase
-Great modding community 
-Alot of hot women

Cons
-Dogshit servers
-Happy chaos
-Asuka
-Very watered down combat mechanics compared to older guilty gear games
-Floor ranks is a very flawed ranking system
-There isn't much single player content 
-Most of your r-code data is saved locally so if it shit itself alot of your stuff is reset (has happened to me twice)
-Burst/Gold burst attack level is too high 
-Alot of dlc characters release unfinished and under tuned
-Depending on your region the prices could be inflated and alot of servers are dead most of the time 
-Dizzy isn't in the game

I started with XRD a while back and since the single-player for that one was so goofy I thought about going back through the series to learn more but nothing about the gameplay looked significantly different from XRD in an interesting way. This game certainly feels distinct. When I bought it, I didn't really like Strive for anything but it's art direction and soundtrack. The gameplay felt a too easy and I thought the whole ""wall-break"" mechanic was really shit for a game with burst and RC which gave players plenty of room to escape the corner or even reverse that pressure effectively. Now it's almost exactly the opposite. Out of the original roster the only change I didn't like was Faust but out of the DLC the only redesigns I like more than the original are Jack-O, Bedman, and Testament and I haven't liked a DLC song since Baiken's theme. On the other hand the ""drive-rush"" lite mechanic they've introduced has made the gameplay feel far more fluid to me. It's still not very difficult to do well in Strive but freestyling combo's is feels way better when you can play fast and loose with the new mechanic. It's not very balanced and you can certainly FEEL when a character is good but that's not always a bad thing. I like the direction it's going and honestly, as long as the gameplay improves I don't care how much they botch the designs. Besides Dizzy, please don't do that to Dizzy.

- Single player wise, there is an arcade mode that you fight 8 rounds with increasing difficulty. There is also a survival mode, VS mode, missions which are basically extended tutorials for fighting games and the game mechanics. Other than that, there's a story mode, which is just a movie, no gameplay.

- There are no ""unlocks"", you'll have to pay for new characters. You can play to get money for avatar items and room decorations though

Something that still bothers me so much about this game since day one is the online. Matches play great when you actually are able to get into one thanks to rollback netcode, but trying to get a game going can be a major hassle. There are times where I tried connecting with multiple players for a good 15 minutes to get something going before I had to back out all the way to the title screen to login again. Extremely frustrating and can take the wind out of wanting to continue playing.

The gameplay itself is fine and welcoming for newcomers with the colorful cast of characters. I came back recently just to try out Elphelt and she plays fantastic.

My gripe so far is that the game can be wildly unbalanced even with all the new system mechanics like Wild Assault and Deflect. It does make those moments where you can steam roll really fun but the opposite end of it feels pretty bad. I don't have an exact answer on what to do with this but the way how the meta feels is why I stopped playing early Season 2. Because of this wild unbalance, it doesn't make it a fun game to spectate either.

If you're coming in and wanting to learn a fighting game, this is a great game to do so. The game is still actively being played and you're bound to have a good time. If you're a longtime fan, you'll definitely be seeing the holes in this game on higher levels of play.

I'd overall would recommend this game because it is a solid game. Guilty Gear Strive has brought in so many new players to this awesome franchise and I'd love to see it grow even more.",1629182615,1702408050,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As it stands, I currently get one online match in the lobbies before I am ""disconnected from the host"". Results are mildly better when I am in a private room with friends, but I always run into some kind of connectivity issue within an hour of gameplay. My friends' experiences are pretty similar; this seems to have nothing to do with system or connection issues, but with server load and functionality. 

Not to mention that right now, dozens of successful streamers currently cannot play this game online because of an exploit of the R-Code system, where malicious entities can freeze another user's game, post messages through their avatar's chat, and cause other problems.

This game is beautiful and so much fun to play when it works, but in an era of incredible new fighting games with good netplay experiences, I am unable to keep making excuses for these developers. These games live and die by their online community, and Strive's is dead in the water.

Not really

Is playing it fun?

Not really

Is it easy to learn?

Not really

Is the online any good?

No

Why do you keep playing it?

It's one of those games that's really fun to THINK about playing but actually playing it is miserable

Are the visuals good?

Yes

Should you buy the game to look at them?

No

Is the music good?

Yes

Should I buy the game to listen to it?

No

Is the community any good?

Yes and no. But at the end of the day if every guilty gear was wiped off the face of the planet the Earth would be a better place. A fan of guilty gear can either be one of the kindest, most chill people you'll ever meet, or a complete piece of shit. The only in between is people who are technically ""nice"" but they're annoying as fuck. You can find nice and chill people like the good guilty gear fans everywhere both irl and online, but bad guilty gear fans are a special type of insufferable

What's playing the game feel like?

It's like dating the hottest guy in the world. His skin is smooth and silky, he has gorgeous lips and flowing wavy hair, and he has a lovely voice. Unfortunately every time he sees you he beats the shit out of you and calls you slurs. He's into raceplay, likes kids, and threatens to gut you if you ever think of leaving him. He used to act like an angel but the longer you've dated him the more of a bastard he's shown himself to be

I DO NOT recommend this game to people who...

Enjoy playing games with friends, like having fun, like playing more than one video game at a time, like comprehensive game mechanics, or want to continue enjoying life on this planet

I DO recommend this game to people who...

Like being abused, enjoy arguing with other people on the internet, want to become an insufferable human being, or are on the brink of ending it all

If you do end up buying this game stop the moment you get into celestial floor, it exclusively gets worse from there

At the end of the day all the best parts of this game can be experienced without actually playing it
(like most fighting games)

Buy it if you want

Edit: As time goes on however, it becomes apparent that the Season 3 changes also kinda made snowballing even stronger, if pulled off properly (looking at Chipp).

The lobbies to this day are completely dysfunctional and make you want to stop playing before you even start. The gameplay is fine for a simple low, investment FG. The characters all feel relatively bland/limited compared to older Anime Fighters including previous entries in the series. And it has THE SINGLE WORST character design in modern FGs, Happy Chaos. If you know, you know. At least the soundtrack is fire. The game's biggest strength is that it released in the perfect window where all the great older FGs were starting to reach their end of life, and nothing much was on the immediate horizon. I guess it could be a good gateway to get new FG players into the genre so they can find actual good FGs.

First of all I alwas wanted to get into fighting games. I also understand that those games are especially complex and fast pased. Therefore as a very beginner I started out with the tutorial missions.
Even in the very first tutorial missions I got really frustrated. Let me list a few examples:

- Double Jump
 ""evade the attack by Jumping and then use a jump in any direction"" - well turns out even while the tutorial specifically list diagonal inputs you can only do a normal double jump. Since the timing to evade the attack is quite precice and at my first two tries I plunged directly into the attack I assumed that I should evade the attack by jumping sideways. I basically did multiple diagonal inputs in the air in it just didnt work. In the end the tutorial text was just wrong and the tutorial only allows for a straight upwards double jump

- General Input Timings
I generally had/have no Idea what certain symbols mean. A curved Arrow from Right to bottom, then straight right was confusing to me. I interpreted as right, down, right. I tried it out and failed over and over. Then I thought maybe its down, right, down instead, since from the symbol I couldn't really tell. Here I just had to input the buttons very fast (I used my d-pad on a controller, its way easier with the analoge stick). This misunderstanding is annoying. And I feel like an idiot trying out what seems to be easy instructions, there is so much guesswork.

- Basic Recommendations
I still do not know If Guilty Gear should be played with a keyboard, Controller (analoge stick) or Controller (D-Pad) and im sure there are people who can play with either of those controls. But for me I was unsure if my misinputs are just natural, a lack of talent, or if im using the ""wrong"" input device. The control I mentioned previously was easier to execute with an analoge stick, while inputting via analoge stick proofed to be very finicky when I tried to perform air dashes.

- Overall Experience
In my hour of testing I felt like doing an exam. I had no fun and it seemed to that I would need to invest another 5 hours just to get the basics down. Then I would have to memorize several input string and bite my tongue for every misinput in game. I just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel and wish that there is a breadcrumb of fun in the learning path that keeps me going. I refunded the game because im afraid of giving up half way, being frustrated for hours and have spend money for that experience.

It has fantastic graphics and music and super fun/addicting gameplay, so I definitely understand it's initial appeal.  I started having problems once I started to even remotely take this game seriously a couple of hundred hours in when I really felt I had mastered the mechanics. I started to notice little things about the game I didn't like; The game is just WAY too simple overall, each character has less than 1/2 the moves they had in Xrd. There are also characters that are just.... Objectively easier to play and therefore better than others (May, Ky, Sol, most of the DLCs) people will try to convince you this is not true but they are coping HARD do not listen. While the mechanics are pretty fun and have a decent amount of depth overall, the characters feel incredibly simple. It's like playing Super Smash Bros. with Street Fighter mechanics.  The game has a diverse roster of characters that are super fun to mess around with at first,  but I find that there's just not enough depth to explore within the movesets besides a set few characters, which is INCREDIBLY disappointing considering this games predecessors are Blazblue Centralfiction (different series, same devs) and Xrd. I understand that a lot of moves may overwhelm new players, but that's the entire point of implementing a simplified moveset that filters out just a few moves to choose from. (Ex: Street Fighter 6 simple controls) Another MASSIVE problem with this game is that it has the WORST ranking system in any fighting game I've ever seen. The floor system is absolute garbage, and if anything prevents you from getting proper matches by giving you the option to pick your ""floor"" while needlessly gatekeeping the ""Celestial"" floor off to players that win A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MATCHES IN A ROW (Basically pure chance unless you want to play the game to the point of actual suicide) This leads to a myriad of problems, the most prevalent of which being that if you lose more than (basically 1) match in a row (which is inevitable because it's a fighting game) you lose your floor/rank! Which makes it virtually impossible to obtain a rank of any kind, leaving people with thousands of hours on the game to just sit around and farm wins off of people that are worse than them. The floor system also lets you pick your own opponents in the worst most tedious way possible, frequently leaving you switching between different online lobbies to even FIND a match. Not to mention the game freezes frequently when waiting for online matches, which is adds extra insult to the massive, life threatening injury that is Guilty Gear Strive online. Previous games (Blazblue and Xrd) had lobby settings for friends, but simplified the matchmaking to just clicking a name on a screen and getting into it. Street Fighter 6 has much better online capabilities and the characters are just as diverse so if you're looking for a serious online experience I'd reccoment that or Centralfiction/Guilty Gear Xrd instead. While SF6 is new, those other two are  a bit dated but probably some of the most fun I've had with this genre. As I said before I really used to enjoy this game and recently I came back to it and tried so, so hard to enjoy it again but I cannot play this game without a deep, insatiable rage taking over me. As much as I want to enjoy this game, I DETEST Guilty Gear Strive with every ounce of my being, but I do think it's a decent game and will play it sometimes. Honestly, I HIGHLY reccomend if you're just getting into fighting games, you'll have MUCH more fun with this than a tryhard ass game like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter, but if you're looking for like... a decent fighting game experience, I'd reccomend Blazblue, Soulcalibir, Street Fighter 6, Xrd, Mortal Kombat 11 (Haven't played the new one), Marvel vs Capcom, or pretty much any other game that isn't this one, Melty Blood, or Dragon Ball FighterZ.",1658534872,1701801859,True,0,0,0.519417464733123779,0,True,False,False

Is taken by the heart

Death is king now

Man hunted to waste life's grace

Because everyone is his eyes and ears

Would it have revealed it all?

Guilty Gear -Strive- offers a lot of both people like me on a casual level, as well as those who try to take their abilities to the absolute limit at a competitive scene. 

The cast of characters, their design, and the expansive soundtrack are this game's strongest points. I think this series is really unmatched when you consider the roster overall. There is plenty of fighters to pick from for a person to really find their 'vibe', both in terms of their move set and their respective personalities.

 In low level and mid level play its fun, execution of moves and combos are easy/simple and tense. Floor 6-10 is the most fun.

 In high level play(Celestial), you play neutral and someone converts 1 hit in to a 60% health damage combo. Nago and Sol particularly went from fun match-ups from floor 6-10 to 80% heath bar damage gods.. 

Personally, I think the only way to fix it is to give other characters the ability to get value off their counter hits. I like the fast paced aspect. You really get maybe 3-4 correct guesses to stop/reverse pressure and fights are like popcorn...good luck playing just one.

The servers are TRASH and out of my time i've spent maybe 30 minutes actually fighting someone and the rest of it was just connection error after connection error

And i intentionally went to a higher tower floor because the game is almost dead and at the time of writing this there's like 50 people on the entire ladder playing, and then i lost because they were better at the game than me, and i got demoted for losing an unfair match to begin with. I lost a few more matches for the same reason and every single match was a floor of demotion as punishment for losing to a better player because i had no players at my level to play against.

Hours later i played a few matches against players 'my new level' after getting demoted so many times, won several times and got nothing. Not one promotion.

What is this bullshit that i lose unfair matchups and i get punished EVERY SINGLE TIME, and then i win fair matchups and i am not rewarded at all.

The visuals are simply outstanding, on of the best looking games of this year.

[Oh Strive...

I had previously reviewed this shortly after launch and gave it a 7.5. Time has shifted that opinion, along with revisiting the other Guilty Gear titles.

I think history will reflect on this game as the fast food edition of Guilty Gear. Despite all the marketing hype a critical mistake was made developing the game, in that at it's core it abandoned the essence of the series. Instead of mixing in commonly used tools (such as simple input specials and autocombos) to help new players get adjusted, they opted for gutting movement and defensive options, along with reduced movelists. This, along with a critical lack of any single player content (which would ACTUALLY serve to move units and keep casuals invested, but instead they get a Story mode that is just an Anime movie with no interaction) all results in a Guilty Gear that feels like it is only half finished while running at half speed. 

Online offerings could have provided a reason to keep coming back for more despite the more rudimentary gameplay, but even there developers chose to make climbing the highest mountain relatively easy and accessible. Not so much as having a win points, or rank system, there are merely 11 vague skill ""floors"". If you have basic fighting game skills you can get to floor 7 with ease and the highest rank called ""Celestial"" is easier to reach than the Gold ranks in Street Fighter. It will look good at first glance, but it won't be long until you find yourself in training mode asking if that's all your character can do, and you'll have the same feeling after finishing a drive-thru cheeseburger.


4.5/10

If you want to play Guilty Gear play Accent Core +R, it seems the community there is growing, especially since it has rollback netcode and is super affordable.

If you want to pick up your first fighting game you'll find far more complete and rewarding experiences in Street Fighter 5 Champion Edition or Mortal Kombat 11.]",1638161946,1700631271,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

         -Awesome soundtrack

Cons: -Online lobbies are pretty bad
          -Loading screens can be frustratingly long
          -Story mode is not very fleshed-out (it's essentially a 10 episode anime)
          -Some characters definitely need some balancing (pls nerf Sol and Ram ArcSys)

Summary: My gripes with this game are minute in the face of everything it gets right. This is a great entry point into fighting game for newbs while maintaining depth for the vets. The s-tier visuals and soundtrack are icing on the cake. I cannot reccomend this game enough.

The characters are all pretty unique with no real overlap in roles. Most of them are fun to play and fun to play against, with only a few exceptions.
I think this game is especially new player friendly but still with plenty of complexity if you want it. The ranking structure is also really great, with 10 ""floors"" you can play on, each with its own skill level. You can always go to a higher floor, but can't go below certain floors as your skill improves. This means you have the freedom to keep playing at a higher level if you want to, regardless of what the game thinks, essentially letting you choose your own rank. There's also an unranked area where you can rematch people as many times as you want.
The best part of the game is the netcode. You can reasonably play against people with pings as high as 150 without any discomfort, much better than the absolutely horrible netcode in games like Tekken, SFV, or DBFZ. 
The soundtrack is also great and I would have happily paid $60 just for that.

The biggest downside however, is that a lot of the top characters are so busted that they make the game non-competitive if you don't pick a similar character. Zato, Happy Chaos, and others will put you in constant pressure that will have you trying to block for the entire duration of the round unless you have put an absolutely inordinate amount of time time into learning how to deal with specifically that individual situation.",1624857210,1700265743,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Strive is a step towards bringing Guilty Gear to a larger playerbase. It's intuitive, the feedback every time you land a hit is fantastic, and the aesthetic is amazing. It's a great first fighting game for anyone, in my honest opinion. Even beyond that, the roman cancel system has amount of depth to it that gives people trying to master the game something to sink their teeth into. You can't get to higher levels or play without mastering roman cancels, but you don't need to if playing at high levels doesn't interest you. At the end of the day, strive is flashy, fun, and in your face.

There are reasons why people dislike strive, though. There are enough characters with neutral skips to make neutral frustrating or seem irrelevant. The top character, Happy Chaos, is genuinely unfun to fight against. The grab invulnerability on wakeup and after being hit puts an inordinate emphasis on fuzzies. Problems like these are pointed out by high level players, and that's fine. Strive might not be the game for them. Aside from Happy Chaos, there isn't anything glaringly bad about the game worth despising the game for.

I'd recommend anyone newer to fighting games pick up strive, and I'd still recommend that those with more experience pick it up. With over 500 hours in it, I still love it. If you're a fighting game veteran, though, I'd suggest you look hard at the mechanics before you purchase.

It's too bullshit blazing, RC is the most brain-dead busted thing I have ever seen in any game and allows conversions and borderline TOD off of basically nothing. Everyone dies too fast and meter gains way too fast, especially with positive bonus. In season three already good characters got better due to wild assault, and the not so good ones got left behind. The whole gimmick of wall break on paper sounds good, but the fact that you can get a hard knock down after it with super or wild assault is insane and lets the opponent just reset their pressure while you can do nothing. and positive bonus makes it worse and lets there pressure go on forever. I love you Daisuke but for the love of Christ go play XX Accent Core + or XRD REV 2 if you want a much more balanced, but still at it's core the Guilty Gear experience. I will be playing those from now on since I still absolutely adore this series and the characters. The most left for me here until or if the problems I have are fixed or adjusted is to check out the new characters and play with friends every now and then. #BUFFMYBOYFAUST.",1699741861,1699741861,False,8,2,0.506511867046356201,1,True,False,False

GG:Strive is, like the series as a whole, ""anime maximalism"". Everything is cranked up to the maximum while staying incredibly earnest. There are few series with cooler presentation than Guilty Gear and Strive is no different (though Instant Kills were really cool in Xrd, sad they are gone.)

As a relative newcomer to fighting games, I find matches with equally skilled players any time of the day. The training mode misses some features I loved in SF6 (a baked in frame data display for example), but the mission mode does a much better job at teaching the basics of the game than SF6's character guides and tutorial. 

I love how distinct the characters feel and have big trouble deciding on a main, since almost everyone is fun to play. On a competitive level, some characters might be a bit overtuned, but ultimately it's fairly balanced.

Seeing friends from all walks of life play and work to better themselves at the game stands as a testament to the success of the games mission. STRIVE is more than a subtitle, but a theme at the core of the game that is reinforced by everything inside it, from the story mode, the music, and even the very useless and cheesy and of match analysis the game does for you. The game invites you through its iconic and diverse characters, stays in your memory from its wide array of fantastic music, and keeps you playing and learning with its simple and satisfying game play, all to reinforce its theme of STRIVE-ing to be better.
Strive is not a perfect game by any means, there is plenty to complain about, but at its core lies something to be cherished and remembered, that burning desire to improve that i saw in all of my friends picking up the game, is something that can happen to anyone that picks up the game, and i will never forget the memories I've made, seeing my friends finally kick my ass and being so excited for them despite me losing.
Guilty Gear STRIVE is a game anyone can pick up, something that can inspire anyone to improve, pick it up and have some fun with your friends, i promise fighting games aren't so scary.

Which is why it is such a shame that the lobby to get to the matches is plagued with the classic ArcSys lobby syndrome of not functioning as it should. At least having the option to have a room with just a list of names (see Marvel vs Capcom Infinite) would be a godsend and would alleviate this issue. 
Other than that, the matches are over fast, but the rematch option is just as fast, keeping you involved and engaged. If you have a friend who you want to play dozens of matches against, this game is for you.

It is genuinely a rarity for the servers to let me into a game, without showing me the fabled ""failed to match with opponent"" and failing. Honestly, I would be fine if it functioned 40% of the time. But it doesn't. Its genuinely a exciting moment when the servers allow me to play the game I bought for 40 dollars. And once you're in? It works great. Flawless, most of the time. But the amount of time spent walking around a lobby, watching ""failed to match with opponent"" over and over again, trying to get into a single match is unacceptable. I get into more matches in Xrd, which is a game that has a maximum player base of ten. (xrd is very good though) I'm recommending this game because its great. Fantastic, even. But these servers are really testing my patience here. If I found the genie from Aladdin, fixing the servers for guilty gear strive would be all three of my wishes.

Teething issues:  Yes, GG Strive has some teething issues, with lobbies as many people have said. But the devs are doing a good job pushing out fixes and updates on a regular basis.

I hope the devs are budgeted to update Strive regularly with bug fixes and lobby improvements rather than only adding DLCs. Why? Because, I think, when the FG community sees responsive devs sorting out game issues on a regular basis, that this helps the Strive FG community feel that they've been heard. This in turn helps the FG community stay engaged and active online.

Wish List: 

1) Keep expanding the tutorial/missions for beginners. New players to FG's are the future.

2) Keep working on making the AI really smart. Find creative ways to have the AI imitate human players of different skill levels so that offline against CPU actually preps you for online play. 

3) Keep making that awesome net-code better and better. It's key because it brings people from far away close together. And I think this builds trust between gamers and developers. A trust that's been lacking in other games that have endless loot box mechanics and pay to win features.

RATING: 8 out of 10 – at the moment.

+Visually impressive, stages and character models look great at 4k.

-Lazy and intrusive in game UI
-Soundtrack is mostly washed up deadbeat dad ""metal"" with a side of absolutely disgraceful vocals
-Weak DLC roster
-Very questionable approach to balance

Between learning Street Fighter III: Third Strike and utterly disavowing Tekken in any way, shape or form, GGST won over my heart with its cast of characters, homages to rock, and overall aesthetic. 

Fine, I also thought that I-No, Gio and Ky were hot, okay? I remember not thinking this game was 3D. I was fucking surprised when after a round, I saw Sol up against the stage wall, rendered in glorious 3D. 

""Oh my god.""

My friend has been trying to get me to take my playing to a better level, and honestly, as cool as that is, I'm also content to just screw around. But I did decide to take him up on that. And now I hate Anji Mito. 

Oh well. This game splashes with style, slashes with charm, and dusts you with atmosphere, kickass music, and bombastic moves. I've never been so honored to have my ass get kicked in this game. One day, my Ky wil crush Anji. Guess I gotta learn the matchup.

I hope this is useful for anyone considering giving Guilty Gear Strive a shot, be it a newbie like me or a veteran player of the FG community.
[h1]
[/h1]
[h1]PROS[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Great characters[/b] with unique personalities, mechanics and each with it's own song theme (with lyrics). Seriously, you'll fall in love with them.
[*][b]Absolute [i]BANGER[/i] music.[/b]
[*][b]Easy to grasp but hard to master gameplay.[/b] Learning each character moves and mechanics feels rewarding and fun, and you'll [i]never [/i]stop learning.
[*][b]Incredible art style[/b] and one of the most stunning animations I've seen in any video-game. 
[*][b]Good tutorials[/b]. Really useful if you're new to Guilty Gear or fighting games in general (like me).
[*][b]Intuitive guide for the lore[/b]. In case you like to read hours of convoluted lore and character background, the [i]Guilty Gear World Mode[/i] got you covered. You can also just ignore that, read a wiki or watch some videos, but hey, it's cool to have that in the actual game.
[*][b]Honestly it's just so addictive and fun[/b]. If you like anime, good music and complex combat mechanics, this game is everything you could've asked for.
[/list]


[h1]CONS[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Unstable servers. [/b]It can take a while to find matches and sometimes you'll just get a network error out of nowhere. Didn't happen much to me, but it's important to notice
[*][b]Bad multiplayer interface.[/b] It's unnecessarily convoluted, buggy and also flawed in assigning players to their skill level.
[*][b]Literally unplayable story-mode. [/b]This mode is just an hours-long cutscene with no gameplay, no previous context for new players, and overall just poor a script even for a fully cinematic experience. Really disappointing considering how much potential it had.
[*][b]Outrageous prices for the Season Pass.[/b] Almost half of the character roster are behind a paywall (with more to be added in the following season, and not counting the arenas and extra colors) and the prices of each Season Pass [i]doubled[/i] since I bought the game. I really hope they lower the price soon because this just makes the game content so fucking expansive.
[/list]


[h1]My experience with the game[/h1]
Guilty Gear Strive was my real introduction to the fighting games community. I've never been that interested in the genre and the thought of getting into it was scary, due to it's competitive nature and complicated mechanics. A few months ago, I didn't even know what ""neutral"" meant in a FG context. And to my own surprise, my journey through the game (and the many others that I've decided to explore after) couldn't be more fun and engaging.
To be clear, what got me into GGST wasn't the gameplay, but the soundtrack and characters. I bet anyone can just listen to a few songs and get to know some of the cast to start yearning to learn how to play, just to experience the whole thing. To me it was Baiken, Bridget and May. To you it could be Sol, Nagoriyuki, Testament, Johnny... Even if you know nothing about the lore, the charisma of these characters and the songs associated with them is endearing enough to captivate you.
The thing is, the gameplay simply encapsulates the essence of it's visuals and music, turning the whole experience into a perfect amalgamation of anime art, combat, and rock music. You can feel the beat of the music, the power of each attack, the spectacle of the fight... Honestly it didn't feel all that difficult to grasp. After learning the basics and beating the Arcade Mode on the Hard Route, it almost felt like it wasn't all that complicated of a game. Then I saw what more experienced players can do, and I started to understand what a competitive fighting game feels like.
And the best part? Being defeated by random players that are better than me wasn't demotivating at all. A bit scary, for sure, but it opened my eyes to how much there is to master in this game. Unlike many competitive games I tried, this one made me want to keep playing even after facing defeat. Because it [i]felt good[/i] to play with those characters.
Each one of them is interesting in it's own way, although each person will have their own taste. It could be their design, their personality, their lines, a specific move, their mechanics... My first ""main"" was May, but as much as I love her, Baiken was the character I REALLY wanted to play with. Since I couln't pay for the Season Pass, I bought her DLC individually just to try her out. It made the game 200% more fun, I've been playing non-stop since, grinding every week. Boy I love this game.
Now, considering that the characters are the soul of this game, one would think that the Story Mode would be phenomenal... Unfortunately, that's [i]by far[/i] the weakest part of it, making it my biggest disappointment with this game. Instead of an interactive experience, with good writing and using the amazing music that you listen during the matches, what you get is essencialy a 3D animated movie that is way longer than it should be, with zero context for new players (besides a wiki-style guide that lectures you through the massive lore of the series), convoluted plot, unbearable pacing and an awful animation that feels really out of place considering how good the rest of the game looks. Upon visiting the game, my first impression was that Guilty Gear had great potential for an action anime or manga series: memorable characters, interesting (albeit wacky) story, outstanding soundtrack and great visuals. How could they mess up this part [i]that bad [/i]is simply beyond me. I'd say without hesitation that the soundtrack has a more interesting storytelling than the actual Story Mode.
Does that make the single-player experience terrible? I don't think so. The Arcade Mode is still fun and shows interesting interactions between the characters, and the tutorial missions can teach useful lessons. Besides, you'll always go back to the competitive play. When you jump into online matches, test your skill with other players and learn with your mistakes, that's where the fun is. I couldn't see myself that engaged with a multiplayer game before, but here I am.

[h1]In conclusion[/h1]
My advice to new players is, just pick the character that resonates with you and don't be afraid to face the mayhem. If this is your first fighting game, you've picked the right one. It's intuitive and has the right amount of complexity to make it interesting, while also having the most unique visuals and soundtrack you'll find in the genre. Keep playing and maybe you'll start getting deeper into the FG lexicon, grinding your skills to new levels and start to look up to bigger challanges... Before you know it, you'll already be blazing through matches and addicted to the smell of the game.",1697274148,1697275687,True,1,0,0.501790285110473633,0,True,False,False

It's definitely a good game, I'll give it that. It's just that I can't get into it as much as Blazblue or UNI. I have played other Guilty Gear games albeit not all on Steam, but those were pretty fun in their own way. This game does feel like Guilty Gear in some parts and sometimes feels very different, which I know what is going for. The visuals are amazing and the music is sick, but the gameplay, especially the lobbies, and sometimes the UI give me a slight bit of sourness in my mouth. The game does feel okay at best, the UI dosen't really work for me, and the lobbies are straight up awful. The player matches in the Steam version didn't even function until a patch was rolled out. I would recommend it to newer folk, but as a game right now, I wouldn't recommend it at full price. Let's see what the patches would do to it.

※September 10, 2021
After 3 months and patches, it sure has improved especially since the most recent one. Characters feel more fleshed out except for the bottom tiers, and the networking is slightly better than last time. It still has a quite annoyingly long ""connecting to server"", and after getting used to the gameplay systems, it's not as expressive as other fighting games, but it plays good enough to have fun. Overall, it's still not worth 60$.

※April 3, 2022

This game has become much more advanced with many new discoveries that have made a pretty okay game to a very in-depth, and surprisingly fast fighting game.

Guilty Gear -Strive- is yet the latest in the Guilty Gear franchise, offering a great entry point for newbies while still offering much to master. One of those ""low skill floor, high skill ceiling"" kinda games. Be warned: you may need to build up those skills before successfully tackling Arcade Mode, but Mission Mode exists to teach you many things.

Online's got rollback, skill-based matchmaking, even background matchmaking (so you can practice combos while waiting for a match). You will be assessed on how well you can take down an AI Sol, and assigned a tower floor which has other players your level. You may venture higher if you think you're up for the challenge, but cannot go lower than your floor (unless you're in Celestial, I guess).

There are also a few lesser features for which items can be unlocked:
• Avatar customization (how you're seen online)
• Gallery (to be filled with artworks, music, and even trailers)
• Room furniture (for custom lobbies)
• Digital figure (you can arrange models however you please to take photos and share them online)
items for these features are obtained through fishing. Or in other words, a gacha mechanic. Spend the World Dollars you get from playing online or clearing missions in order to fish.

This game has just 15 characters, not counting DLC. As of Season 3, there is a confirmed 13 DLC characters. That's... an alarming ratio. That's 46.43%!! In any case, they each come with some banger tunes. The whole soundtrack's an banger, really.

Due to some... complications, the online for this game has reached a level of inconsistency that is no longer acceptable. There are no exceptions: if the online modes for your primarily-multiplayer game don't work, you get a thumbs down. This game was in a pretty great spot before the problems with online started, and I hope the team is seriously working hard to provide a fix.

I've heard the problems are being caused by a cyber-attack, then I heard it was an issue with adding cross-play into the mix post-launch. Either way, it doesn't matter to me: the lobby system was pushing it as far as online play was concerned, and now on top of all the previous problems it just doesn't work. I've been on board for the additional 2 seasons of content, but I don't see myself buying into another season's worth of content if the problems aren't fixed.

Best of luck, ArkSys. I'm looking forward to the day I can edit this review back to a positive one.

OG Review:
I love fighting games, but have never messed with anime fighters for more than a few weeks at a time. I've kept coming back to this one after about a year, so I'd say it's a winner.

Pros
+ presentaion is outstanding
+ gameplay trims the fat of most anime fighters while maintaining complexity for plenty of room to grow
+ tutorials on fighting game basics are thorough and plentiful
+ online netcode is great (finally they show us the ping!)
+ Combo creator is a clever addition that can keep you occupied for hours on end
+ story mode is just a movie basically... but at least it's a pretty good movie
+ feels like something different for the anime fighter subgenre

Cons
- story mode requires 2+ hours of youtube studying if you haven't touched the series before
- online lobby system to get into matches is half-busted (""failed to connect to duel station"" is way too common). please just give us regular matchmaking, please for the love of God ArkSys stop it with the lobbies.
- no combo trials from the dev team (might take some time to weed through the not-so-great ones in the combo maker mode, or ones that are obsolete because of updates)
- massive jump in online ranked skill between floor 10 and ""heaven,"" many players are complaining about the entry system that must be ""earned"" to get into heaven every month. Because there are no floors at the heaven rank, intermediates are thrown into the arena with the best of the best, which isn't always the best way to learn.

As far as fighting games go this one's still an easy 5 out of 5. If you're an anime fan and all those Naruto/Demon Slayer/One Piece fighters keep letting you down, try this. You won't be disappointed.",1635457832,1696988399,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A pretty decent anime style fighting game. The soundtrack is excellent and the gameplay can be very fun at times. In addition, the graphics and animation are also excellently done.  

In contrast to the game’s marketing, there is very little story and singleplayer content. The game’s “story mode” is just one extremely long cutscene and another fairly long cutscene (which I honestly don’t mind that much (and most users shouldn't even try to watch in the first place)). On singleplayer content, there are about 3 things you can do alone; “survival mode”, “arcade mode”, and “vs cpu”. Survival mode is a (boring) infinite series of player vs ai matches. Once every 10 or so opponents are defeated, you face off against a “boss” opponent. This goes on until you die. Arcade mode is a short (also boring) series of 8 player vs ai matches, with some story surrounding the character you use. Finally for singleplayer content, the “vs cpu” mode is a single match against an ai opponent who is using a character of your choosing. 

However, the real meat and bones of this game’s play time comes not from the singleplayer content. The multiplayer in this game is well done. I have had quite a lot of fun playing this game with friends. For the most part, this game is balanced enough to the point where no character is very noticeably better than another. Now as I have said, I have had a lot of fun playing this game with friends. Friends who live very long distances from me, and I have the netcode to thank for that. The netcode on this game is very good (as is most rollback), which results in smoother online play. You can also load into online matches with random people. The ranking system for random matches online is not all that great, but it is just fine, and does its job. The gameplay has enough depth, I can’t really say more as enjoyment is subjective. 

Unfortunately, now, we get to my biggest issue with the game and ultimately a deciding factor for many users. The price. This is a $40 game, which is fine, if not a bit expensive. The real issue is the DLC. The DLC systems are very annoying, resulting in, for example, getting a cast about half the size of BlazBlue: Centralfiction’s for nearly twice the price. Insane.

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion, this is a good game, with a lot of fun to be had with its excellent netcode, fun gameplay, and amazing soundtrack. Sadly, it is weighed down by a heavy price tag for a low character count, and has paid DLC.

CONCLUSION CONCLUSION:

It’s good, but expensive. If you can, get it on sale.",1696052558,1696052558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In case you aren't aware, as of the 24th of August 2023, ArcSys has made the incredible decision of getting rid of regional pricing in some countries.
Here is what this means in practice:
[list]
    [*]Some countries were hit with ridiculous price increases. We got hit with a 2x price increase, and I'm starting to think we were lucky. People from other countries reported they got hit with 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x and even [u][b]a mind boggling 10x price increase[/b][/u]. Really, it would be funny if it weren't so sad.
    [*]This also means that, [u][b]in some places, Strive by itself with no DLC is more expensive than it was on launch[/b][/u]. In our case it was R$ 129.99 back in 2021, and now it is R$ 179.99. The previous price on the day before this new change was R$ 86.99 btw, so it really more than doubled for us.
    [*]And since everything doubled, [u][b]a season pass now costs even more than the base game did just a couple of days ago[/b][/u]. Previously for us it was R$ 56.99, and now it is R$ 107.99. So basically, season 3 costs 20 bucks more than the base game for people that got the game before August 24 lol. I bought the Ultimate Edition back in May, and got the game + seasons 1 and 2 + a bunch of new character colors for a discounted price of R$ 122.49. It is simply impossible for me to justify spending so much on S3, and unless there's a sale or the prices get readjusted, I might skip it entirely. Hell, might drop the game completely even. I'm not interested in keeping up with a game where I can't afford any of the new content lol.
    [*]Btw, here's a fun fact: [u][b]some people have reported that in their region, this new season pass costs as much if not more than Street Fighter 6[/b][/u], which is an entirely *new* fighting game game with substantially more content than Strive lol
[/list]
Overall, it really feels like ArcSys is actively trying to kill Strive at this point, and if this is the case, I wish them the best of luck in their endeavours lmao. Because I'm not sure what raising the prices for people in poorer countries accomplishes. Sure, it might make them more money, but that means even less of us can actually afford it. And I don't know if you guys are aware, but for a game with dogshit single player content (story modes are just big movies and not even playable, and arcade and training modes are literally the bare minimum these days) in a genre where the multiplayer aspect is the most important component, having more players is very very important. Vital even, you might say lol. As of the time of me writing this comment (25/08/2023), they still haven't addressed the issue in any way, shape or form. Funny enough they did already talk about fixing Faust's banana crashing the game lol.

So idk, pray for a sale or a price change if you are really interested in this and live in a country with garbage economy. Just be aware that the online might be completely dead by then lmao.

Edit (26/08/2023): I have just checked and it seems that the soundtracks (Necessary Discrepancy 1 & 2) didn't have their prices altered in any region at all? I'm not sure if this means anything, but it could possibly indicate that the new pricing is an error? But given the lack of official acknowledgement, I wouldn't count on it though.

[strike]Edit (10/09/2023): ArcSys has a survey about season 3 going on (you can find a link on their GG twitter @GUILTYGEAR_PR). If the price change has affected you too, PLEASE considering telling them through there as well. Survey closes on the 14th of September. Let's hope they listen.[/strike]

Edit (28/09/2023): Well, it's been over a month now and the price hasn't been reverted or at least lowered. It's very safe to assume that this is the new price and it won't be changed.

I'll be honest, I am beyond disappointed with ArcSys. I haven't even touched the game since S3 dropped, the initial interest and hype I had when I got it is basically all gone. Not being able to enjoy the same content as everybody else kind of sucked the excitement out of the game.

Say what you want, but her gameplay is just destroyed in this game. She can't play against a strong rush down. She can't play against strong zoning and neutral. She lost her main tools. My character keeps losing at the equivalent level. Previously, Millia had a place under the sun, but in this game she is simply helpless. You have to be an idiot not to notice this, and you have to be a nasty hypocritical bastard to justify it. Millia has suffered too long in this cheap game and continues to suffer at a high competitive level. Nothing changed. Regardless of the fact that there are a couple of the same bottom characters forgotten by the developers. but I don't care about them. I care about my waifu.

I am not a fan of buffs in this game. These buffs didn't really help any character from the bottom. Literally. They polished the top gorillas, making them the ultimate broken junk, while the characters from the bottom received modest, barely noticeable help over the course of 5 patches in this game.

It's total hypocrisy on the part of the Strive public to now say that characters like Faust, Anji, Millia, and the like ""bottom dwellers"" can compete against broken S level monkeys. It's all a lie, the rhetoric of lying bastards who have no reason to say it , until those characters can compete against S level in this game.

Important. S tier in this game is not 1, 2 or 3 characters. This is a List of almost half of the roster.

Saying that some character ""can't get close to S"" automatically puts him in the bottom half of the roster. Literally. How are the High Tier characters who are doomed to be at the bottom of the list?

In fact, Millia has a lot of unplayable matchups against Po, GL, So, Ra, Le, Ch, Ma, Ch, JackO, Za, Ba, Gi..., it just devalues Millia as a competitive character. I've been talking about this for 2 years now, but stupid clowns still can't figure it out...

Do not disgrace yourself and study Millia in AСPR. Millia in Strive is a mockery of her. You can only defeat very stupid lower lvl opponents. Against the equivalent level, you have no chance in this game. Don't fool yourself. This is what I have seen over the 5 patches of this game.

Of course, Strive's cheap and biased audience has no capacity for critical thinking. They just believe what cheap bastards like Hotashi, Sajam and LK are telling them.

Strive is a cheap game where Millia was and still is at the bottom of the competitive scene and can't compete at an equivalent level of skill. At the same time, most of the scrubs openly hate and mock her as the most ""dishonest"" character in this game. Complete Absurd. These people have neither honor nor conscience. Do something with this cheap gorilla game please.",1695899977,1695900447,False,3,2,0.493421077728271484,3,True,False,False

I started playing it about six months ago, a little while before the release of Asuka. Its the first 'serious' fighting game I've ever played, assuming you don't count platform fighters like Smash or my very short look at Persona 4 Arena. It went from just some new fighting game to my second most played game on Steam, and easily my favorite fighting game of all time. Shortly after getting into this game, I went back and played all the previous Guilty Gear games on Steam, save for Isuka. My most played is still Strive by far, but I've put a bit of time into all of them. I figured I would preface all of that before explaining what makes the game good.

Here are all the reasons this game deserves your 40 dollars plus DLC.

-Gameplay-
Strive is a very beginner friendly fighting game with a low skill floor. It was the first serious fighting game I ever played, but I improved quickly and did well. Just about anyone can launch the game and pick someone like May or Faust and be alright from the get go, so long as they understand how inputs work. Even without knowing special inputs, some characters can get away with just their normal attacks. It's not hard to learn, and even if you're completely new to the game, you'll get the hang of it faster than you probably expect. That said, if you try and go any higher than floor 4 or 5 with such little skill, you will naturally get your shit rocked. You need to learn how the game works before you can get up that high, unless you're playing an easy character. The unique Roman Cancel system, along with the Burst system and the new mechanics added in Season 3, make any character, simple or technical, have a lot of depth. There are still optimal characters and best ways to play, but there isn't really a 'bad' character in the game. Any character can get good results online if you yourself know how to play them.

-Music-
Of course I had to talk about music. People joke that this game is actually a 40 dollar soundtrack with a free game tacked on, and I would have to agree with them. This game's music is amazing. I personally buy a lot of Steam Soundtracks, since they're higher quality than I could find on YouTube or Spotify. This game alone has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long while, even ignoring songs from the older games. There isn't much more to say, just a really good soundtrack.

-Characters-
The characters in this series have really great designs, personalities, and are really fun. It would take way too long to describe them all, so just play the game.

-Community-
This game is still very alive. It was at Evo for the past few years, it has a massive online following, and there are still thousands of people playing. The community that surrounds this game is one of the kindest game communities I've ever been part of.


In closing, just buy it if you're on the fence. It's a great game. It has some network issues at times, and random quiet price increases are scummy, but I feel that the pros outweigh the cons.",1695533965,1695533965,True,8,0,0.587777495384216309,0,True,False,False

Take everything that made the older games great and throw it out the window and you get Strive. The only good thing I can really compliment is the Graphics but not anything else. ArcSys tried to sell the game as a neutral heavy game just to slowly retract that statement over time, ESPECIALLY with the combo training mode. The point of the extremely high damage was to emphasize that point. The Damage thing is just also not really a fun thing. 

The soundtrack is repetitive, this would be fixed if nearly the entire soundtrack wasn't lyrical since the lyrics can get really repetitive as well. When Sky Should Be High is the best song in the game you know you did something wrong. (Not trying to say that's a bad song or anything)

Bringing back older characters as paid DLC is something that just shouldn't exist (Can't really knock on strive specifically since most fighting games do this)

There's also just the fact that the game was made to ""appeal to casuals"" which I can understand what they're trying to do but it only hurts the game. Especially when Xrd Games were already easier than the Accent Core games, which were extremely difficult to play. This actively makes you worse as a fighting game player considering that it has you adapt to an easier environment. Which also gives you the demoralizing mindset of getting washed in any game with more complexity, considering how you have to work more to achieve results. 

In all honesty, we should've just gotten a Rev 3.",1695310794,1695310794,False,12,1,0.531098842620849609,0,True,False,False

I struggle to find what else to say, this series just appears to get less and less wacky with each instalment.

I played X and Accent Core as a kid, immediately enamoured with the soundtrack, characters and presentation.
I've always been a little sad at some things that got removed between that and Revelator, but Rev has so many of its own cool features to make the changes worth it.

Every character in Strive feels like they've been nerfed, like they've just forgotten a bunch of moves they used to know for the sake of balance, and though they've done quite a decent job at re-balancing the experience around these changes, I still cannot agree that it is a better experience overall - In the end, that's all I want from a sequel, for it to be better than (and probably have more stuff) than the previous entry.

It looks prettier than Rev 2, breaking walls in the corner shakes up the combat nicely, and some inputs feel a bit easier to do with marginally better sound design in some areas.
That said, the music isn't so much better as it is just different now that it includes lyrics (The GG soundtracks have always been drowning in bangers) and so there just aren't all that many improvements, especially with such a small roster of characters. It's much easier to learn, and maybe that's the purpose of it - If you're new to the series, I guess take this as a recommendation? I would still recommend playing a simpler fighting game first to grasp the basics.

The new characters are pretty cool at least, and I look forward to seeing them all get Zappa'd in the next Guilty Gear, hah.

Also I suppose it would be remiss of me not to mention that Testament being a trans woman is awesome, makes perfect sense in context of the plot, and is a wondrously welcome addition to the series that is by no means necessary, but doesn't detract either - Testament's boring-ass new moveset? Not so much.
...I say this mainly to preface that I think I would've preferred to have some non-offensive, non-joke femboy/enby representation in the form of Bridget, but I guess things could be way worse on that front, lol. So I s'pose I'm happy enough about that too, even if it doesn't make the game worth playing.",1695298162,1695298162,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Because when you purchase this, you're not getting Guilty Gear - The Game, but rather Guilty Gear - Lobby Simulator. And by the looks of things it will be multiple years and possibly in the game's end-of-life when that will be fixed. If at all. A year later, and a new season pass is being sold, yet not a single change in sight to the matchmaking system and their ""improvements"" to server connection times still lead to 30+ sec start screen waiting from the EU. Yes, you sit on the start screen for almost a minute (It was much worse before, i didn't bother testing it with the update because it will still long enough).
But I'm sure they'll keep cranking out characters, make new season passes and more. If you think you only care about the core fighting game experience, this will be a great game for you. Me personally, I can't sit through their shit lobbies, shitty networking design, shittier matchmaking experience and equally as shit everything else. I'll possibly return to it when they fix this hot mess (looking like when its dead), if I'm not already busy with my huge backlog of other games to play that actually respect my time. 
One other small thing that you can take from what you will. I was looking through SteamDB and saw Skyrim still has a min 14k players (SE, not including the old one). A single player game. Meanwhile this has a max of 8k. But of course, its different genres, every other FG sits at similar numbers (T7, SFV, MK11), and its not an apples to apples to comparison. Even then, I do think I'd rather go play Skyrim than this lobby game. Guess I'll just use Elden Ring to scratch my PvP itch.",1623442580,1695281843,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me start by saying this game is good fun. Press buttons, cool stuff happens. The Cast is incredibly eye catching and filled with personality, the mechanics are simple and gameplay is fast and flashy no matter how new you are to the game. As a bonus - even If you are getting into the game - it's not too late, just be ready to know that the ""honeymoon"" period of this game sailed off two years ago. However the game at it's core is very easy to pick up, fun as part of fighting game mastery and can times be absolutely hilarious with the right crew of people.

However as we approach year 3, the original things that made it great are starting to show their own issues. In particular match-making is starting to stutter. I had the option of playing S1 on PS5 very early on and it was crazy how packed the rooms were; you could get a match pretty much instantly and you were never pitted against someone who'd outright smoke you because everyone was in the same boat. Nowadays and Notably; Anything below level 7 in Tower (effectively the Elo System to have you fight players at your skill level) is beginning to get empty and getting a string of games against varied opponents to improve your skill is less frequent (still enough around though).  The player base is what I'd say ""still healthy"" for a fighting game this old but far from its first few months (peaking around a 1/3rd of what it once was on new patch day), But Ideally one of the next steps for Arc systems is to collapse the number of Tower levels from 10 to around 5 and find a way of keeping matchups as close as possible.

Now Don't get me wrong this is just a natural part of game life and the game is fun, but it has some other issues. First it's the damage. S1 & S2 Damage output was insane in this game with two-touches quite common (especially for Chipp players). Season 3 has seen a slight reduction of damage, but even a suboptimal combo can land you a good 30% off someones lifebar without any real effort; and the damage you take just regular blocking is still crazy high - Yes there's a mechanic to mitigate this but good lord do bodies drop quickly. Next is the combo-routing: the game got ""solved"" quite quickly because damage and combos were so high and easy to do, due to this as new characters have popped in and others received buffs/nerfs not that much has shifted. They also changed the ""Gatling"" system - a combo system in older games, up a bit - I can't tell if this is good are bad. It's good because there's less of an auto-combo system in place, but bad in that it's more about knowing to do what combo when rather than random routing off a lucky counter-hit.  

Third issue is that Arc System works seem reluctant to shake things up and I can understand why - deviate too much and you annoy the loyalists; however Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, MK 1 are all out / or coming out; and and at this point SF6 has pretty much redefined the bar when it comes to content in a fighting game. For GG to remain competitive it needs something to make it stand out - what that will be though is hard to say. I mean it does come with whats basically an anime movie, the lootbox game of fishing is a cool distraction, and missions really help develop your game knowledge. However beyond that there's very little stuff to ""do"" other than hop online and alot of people don't want that.

Next is the cool but not really helpful combo-learning system. Back in XRD you had missions and trials to work through with each character. Strive ""sort of"" has this - in the sense that the community make these trials through the combo builder system. This is great as you can get everything from ""oh wow I didn't know you could do that"" moments to absolute meme/trolling types, however you can't help but feel it would have been really handy to have about x10 Arc-System implemented tutorials for each character for you to get a solid foundation for each of them and then have the creation mode be what topped/built/theory crafted characters to the next level.  

Final issue is the price - fighting games have gone beyond tolerable in cost now for what you get. The Base game is around £37 GBP at time of writing, but over £90 for the seasons passes bundle (i.e. extra characters) and a load of colour swaps. Nothing really changed across the seasons other than the roster and title screen - no new game modes or features. That makes it a Hard nope if you want to buy and own it now - so as usual the advice for something this old is wait for a sale; if the base game is sub-£30 and the season bundle around £60 you've got a good deal; above that you are just fuelling a really lame business model that seems to be in every fighting game these days.

So Overall where does that leave Strive? Personally I'm still on the fence about this game - 2/3rd's of it I love, the remaining 1/3rd is indifference or distaste. End of the day I would recommend it to people at the right price and doubly so if you just like Arc Systems / Anime / Fighting Games. Early on as a new player you will be allured by the visuals, as you grow into it you'll like what you can do with the combat system (the Roman Cancel system is really what makes GG stand out mechanically); and when you really know the game you'll enjoy what High level in tower can offer. Also for an anime-style fighter (which are typically degenerate messes) it's pretty solid and it's only at higher game-play levels gaps in characters start to show; but for a laid-back play with friends or like-skilled players any character is viable.",1695156597,1695156597,True,2,0,0.52507472038269043,0,True,False,False

- Looks incredible.
- Music is killer.
- Characters are (fairly) fun. Balance is up for debate.
- Game is simple to pick up but has enough depth to be interesting.
- Tutorials and Mission mode, while a bit basic, cover all the basics you should know to jump in.
- Online is incredible, the only fighting game I've played where I don't even have to think about how my connection is going to be.

- Game takes a while to load up, connecting to servers and all, but I'll take that any day for great netcode.

Or get Xbox PC pass, where it's just $11 AUD a month.

this game is ridiculously accessible and easy to learn. However, online connection can be abysmal (at least for me) and the ranking system isn't very good (Arc Sys has stated they will fix this). Character designs and art direction is off the charts, music is insane and the lore is certainly something (I made a presentation for my friends based on the main character, it ended up being an hour long).

Ranked is completely awful--elo has been around for decades and works, please use it.

Input parser feels completely nonfunctional often and screen freeze buffer windows don't make sense--it doesn't feel like I'm in control of my character.

Too much extremely specific counterplay is expected matchup knowledge e.g. If your counterplay involves consistently using an instant faultless defense, the offensive mechanic in question is too powerful--instant faultless is too conditional for something that requires that you stop blocking.

Positive Bonus is also one of the worst designed snowball mechanics in any fighting game leading to inescapable checkmates due to chip damage even with a reasonable amount of remaining health. The fact that you get this buff after dealing a massive amount of damage and the cost is just resetting to neutral (or if you break with an Overdrive being PLUS THIRTY-SIX WHY?).

Great for people who want to get into fighting games.

Most of the characters follow simple A -> B -> C combo routes. They started adding in new moves for the cast but only a few at a time and some feel somewhat meaningless outside of some specific neutral situations.

I'll be honest I prefer Xrd Rev 2's system of combat regardless of how complicated that game is and this is because each character has so many options and combo possibilities.

However I'll admit that Rev 2 and Accent Core Plus R can be stressful games.
Strive in its simplicity kind of helps ease things up a bit for me.
If I take a break from Guilty Gear a month or two I need only to start up Strive and start picking back up what I may have forgotten.

And then when I spend time relearning or learning new things it has massive benefits.
I got back to the other games a little more confident.

I do need to also mention something else I appreciate about Strive. I don't need to buy two different versions of the game if I want to play with someone on another platform. Strive handles cross play very surprisingly well. I got to play with an old friend of mine I haven't seen in a while on PlayStation 4 and we grinded several hours on this game just like we used to on BlazBlue and Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 years ago.

I'm going to sound like a broken record now because what I'm about to say, others have said too.
But for how much I enjoy Strive I do hate that many of the characters and their combos are a little too simplified. 

I play Baiken in several games. I like how she plays here very much, her new parry is a welcomed and much appreciated addition to her move list. But I wish she kept her old parry and parry dash too.

It feels very off to no longer at least some of the old strategies she had in other games.
In fact I feel its a shame she can't combine her old stuff with the new.

I am grateful however that Strive didn't go the same way as Dragon Ball FighterZ and just give us a ton of auto combos. Granted that game can have very creative combo options too and its fun.
But auto combos do not help anyone new to your fighting game. In fact it ruined my ability to grasp and realize the combo potentials there or be able to learn to fight certain online match ups.

So thank you Strive for not doing that. So long as you stick to your roots even with the new stuff I'll keep coming back. Still hoping for next season all characters get some new move from the old games. Or maybe the next sequel they would bring back the complexity we enjoyed in Xrd Rev 2 and expand upon the new stuff the Strive introduced.

Lastly I'll give praise to the animation quality and soundtrack. Strive's a beast of a game.
If you're new to Guilty Gear and reading this review, give this game a try as it will be a good start into this series especially with its simpler gameplay. You might find yourself going back to older games like Rev 2 after to put your skills to the test.

I think now that it's been half a year and Strive maintained a decent enough playerbase it's safe to call it a succesful continuation of the Guilty Gear franchise and something that clearly attracted a lot of new players or returned old ones.

For the most part it's well deserved. The presentation and animations are wonderful. Music for the most part is great. The netcode is fantastic, and characters feel generally good to play. Despite all the problems I have with the game it's a solid FG to jump into for anyone looking for something new or looking for their first fighting game.

That said, there's plenty of issues with Strive even after several patches. Some are a result of rushed development, others are just design decisions that I personally dislike. Most notably the loading times are still terrible. Even if the community mostly solved the issue thanks to Totsugeki app, ArcSys showed little care for the playing experience for anyone outside Japan. Even the most recent patch that adressed loading times only aimed to improve it for USA audience which is honestly insulting.

Outside of that there's some problems with stability of the game. While game itself doesn't crash (at least for me), the netplay experience is hindered by a multitude of errors, dysfunctional lobbies and weird disconnects. I honestly think the game would have more players if Strive was delayed but came out with lobbies that work.

Speaking of lobbies, along custom combo creation tool that was teased pre-launch, lobby customization is one of the thing that's yet to make it into the game thanks to Strive clearly coming out ahead of the schedule. While these are not major issues, they are still issues.

Things that are present also took a minor downgrade compared to Xrd, most notably the training mode that doesn't teach you nearly as much and the combo trials that are largely terrible and don't do a good job of preparing you to fight no life larries and wi-fi demons. This would be fine if custom combo sharing was a thing but we're still waiting.

When it comes to design, I'm honestly nowhere near good enough to have a nuanced and credible opinion on it but I personally hate how much damage everything deals in Strive. To me, a fighting game is way more fun when you can't die from 2-3 combos and strategy has more value, which might sound even less credible when coming from a Tekken fan. Still, it never feels good to eat a random poke or a counter hit and see your lifebar file for a divorce. It doesn't help that defensive mechanics in Strive are not as deep as Xrd's. No blitz, no dead angle, YRC costs as much as a super, instant block is so strict that even pros can't use it effeciently.

Ranked system is one of the worst in gaming. I feel quite confident in saying that because I've never experience anything worse. You know how traditionally games use a system like ELO or GLICKO to figure out your skilla and assign you an MMR? Well, Strive doesn't care about that, it's too Rock and Roll for it. Instead you got 10 floors + Celestial where you can do a special 5 wins in a row challenge to prove you're second Diego Umijuarez. Words cannot describe how bad it is. You can always ascend to floor 10 if you want, you just can't play below your floor, which means everyone is basically at 10 no matter their skill. Celestial is also just same floor 10 players who got lucky and played a favorable matchup or farmed worse players. To call it ranked is a joke but it's the best we have unfortunately. 

The mess doesn't stop on that. If you que by going into the tower itself not only does it waste time, but it also allows people to preview what character you play, allowing them to easily dodge any bad matchup or character they don't like. Terrible decision.

The removal of gatlings is also super questionable to me. While it's easy to get used to, it does make offense a bit more boring all around to me compared to how it was in other games. 

Lastly, I'm not a fan of some character changes. Not cause of anybody getting weaker/stronger but just cause they feel a bit more sterile compared to previous iterations. Strive still got its own kind of sauce but it just doesn't feel as exciting. 

Now to reiterate, I still think the game is fun and worth jumping into. Netcode is great, population seems mostly stable and might even grow after offline tournaments or least 1 DLC character that's not lame as hell. The game needs a lot of improvements but if you're into fighting games, you kinda know that we have to eat a spoon of garbage for a drop of honey and this is the smallest spoon of garbage we've had in a long time. That said, if Xrd had this netcode and comparable amount of players, I'd probably not touch Strive.",1637930529,1693873378,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But, if you like fighting games that have a bit of footsies and whatnot, then this game is for you. Think of the combo game in Strive as 25% DBFZ and 75% SF. Additionally, don't forget to include one of the games major mechanics ""Roman Cancels"" which allow you to make any move in your character's arsenal plus on block, make a whiffed move safe, extend combos, and a get off me tool, similar to Dragon Ball's spark mechanic but mid-combo. In this game the roster only consists of 15 characters, however, those characters are extremely different from one another. I can definitely see myself playing this game for years. In conclusion, if you like fighting games, get the damn game.

i can't say anything that most other people have repeated a million times already so ill just say:
- one of the greatest fighting games of all time, showing off a veteran's studio's years of experience
- each character is oozing with personality and style
- garbage lobby systems that only get a pass because the netcode is good (especially compared to what other japanese devs were putting out at the time)
- streamlined mechanics that don't take away from the essence of a good fighting game match, and despite the simplicity they still somehow allow you to style out and feel good about it, especially in season 3
- 9/10 not as good as the other guilty gears doe

It is the most successful entry in the 25-year-old franchise and for a good reason. This game will certainly be a main stay in the FGC for years to come[/h1]


 [b]Presentation [/b]
   As I mentioned before in the Street Fighter 6 review, Guilty Gear Strive is a game that knows what it wants to be. I am not familiar with the franchise, so my opinions and thoughts would be just about this particular title, but I can say for sure that this game has style. Beautiful cell shaded graphics alongside an amazing original soundtrack and sound design. It has artistic merit all along the way. Not only that but the character design is top tier, and when compared with games like Tekken, KoF and MK it is clear that this game is far superior in that regard. 


 [b]Features [/b]
    There are four ways to fight people in this game: ranked mode, for fun, local and at player lobbies. The most interesting of these four is ranked mode's implementation. The ranked mode revolves around ""floors"" instead of an Elo. You start ranked against a CPU opponent that measures your power level and puts you on a floor. There are 11 floors in the game, 1 to 10 and then the celestial floor. The higher the floor number, the higher the skill of its players. Floor placement is way more fluid and dynamic than elo: you can go up or down in a matter of hours, so consistent play is way more important. One bad day and all your work can go to nothing. While a bit cruel, this system can give the sensation of a true ""ascension"" and journey, with highs and lows, so, because of that, I consider it a more interesting way of showing progression in the game.
    Training, arcade and tutorials are very well made as well. You can even create and save your own combos, watch old matches and try to fight against an almost invincible final arcade boss. My only complaint is with the story mode: There is nothing to play, only a literal 4 hour movie. Since story mode is not a very important or strong part of most fighting games i can let it pass, but it is still a little disappointing. 


 [b]Gameplay [/b]
Guilty Gear Strive has the gattling system:

- Punch (P) cancels into Punch or Command Normal

- Kick (K) cancels into Dust (D) or Command Normal

- Close Slash (S) cancels into Slash, Heavy Slash (HS), Dust or Command Normal

- Slash cancels into Heavy Slash

    Besides that, there are the Roman Cancels and Bursts. Roman cancel is when you press 3 action buttons, besides Dust, and your character sends a shockwave that slows down the enemy for a few frames depending on the situation (which is indicated by the color of the Roman cancel: Blue, Yellow, Red and Purple), giving you tools to scape, trap or even extend combos. The burst is either a ""get off me"" tool to stop combos from enemies, or a more aggressive tool to gain meter faster when used at the right instant. All those mechanics are integrated in a fast-paced combat that gives room for smart play, quick thinking and originality. It is immensely satisfying to perform those mechanics and use them to your advantage, while maintaining your own fighting style.",1682464251,1693204973,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Updates come and go that make minor changes to one thing or another but never address the things people have been complaining about since release.

Half of the terminals for matches in lobbies just don't work, you walk up to them and just get an error message. Probably another half again of the terminals people manage to get onto won't accept opponents, they just give another error message. There's a semi-automated matchmaking system that will place you against people while you practice in training mode so you can sort of circumvent the barely functioning lobbies, but it's unable to handle people who go AFK in the queue or people you've declined matches or rematches with, so if you get matched against someone like that the system will just keep giving you the same exact prompt to play them over and over.

The ranked tower constantly interrupts you by limiting you to three matches against someone at a time, presumably to stop people from grinding easy rank off of someone, but doesn't stop you from just getting back on the terminal again against the same person after those three matches for three more. All it accomplishes is forcing you to sit through loading screens. Every few matches it will also stop you completely to inform you you're being moved to another floor so you never get any time to get to known people on any floor, defeating the purpose of a lobby system entirely. The whole system is also set up in such a way as to gradually shift the entire playerbase upwards in level, regardless of whether or not people are really getting better at the game, so eventually everyone will basically just be lumped together in one big pool where the skill disparity is comical. It's already happened for the top half of the playerbase and it's probably only going to be another couple months before it's happened to the bottom half as well.

EDIT: They finally added pre-match ping indicators in the second year of the game's lifespan, they take a good 10+ seconds to show up though and are frequently inaccurate, I've had many matches that showed a stable 40-80 ping green connection indicator before the match only to be horrible 8f rollback lagfests. But hey, at least the indicator is there now, useful or not that's a step in the right direction.

You'll also sometimes get disconnected mid-round for seemingly no reason, perfectly good matches stop abruptly mid attack with a minute long ""please wait"" message before you're kicked all the way back to the main menu. Sometimes it doesn't even get as far as letting you start the match and just gives the disconnect message as soon as you approach a terminal.
It's really embarrassing that people point to this as the fighting game with the best netcode, if a game in any other genre was released with these kinds of network issues it would be mocked ruthlessly.

The game has acquired a reputation for being a good entry point into the fighting game genre but it's vastly overblown, the tutorials are garbage for anything more than learning you can hold back to block and how to extend your combos but the real meat of learning the game is understanding what every character can do and the character-specific tutorials are awful and go no further than ""hit the slow move before it finishes"" or ""jump over the projectile"". They added a system for sharing combos with other players to help people learn offense but you can't load those combos into training mode to practice against, you have to manually record yourself doing the combos so if you're struggling to figure out how to deal with something you better hope you're able to do it yourself.

It's really a shame because from a strictly gameplay perspective it's an enjoyable game, but when you have to go through such a struggle just to get to the point of actually playing the game and it's fighting against every attempt you make to improve it's hard to feel like it's worth launching at all.

SEASON 3 UPDATE: They said in the patch notes that they'd fixed a lot of the issues with the lobbies. They lied, all the old issues are still present but on top of those now when you try to change between rooms you get a network error and get kicked back to the start screen and have to go through all the menus again to get back to the room you were trying to go to.",1638412855,1693174115,False,3,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

It still has qualities worth praise, the music and art direction is still godlike as you'd expect of the modern series, however, nearly every single other aspect of the game has become increasingly poorly managed post release, and is now at a breaking point for me.

The servers now barely work and have had severe issues for over a year yet despite online quality being one of the original big praises for the game andArcSys has done nothing to fix it, and online being in shambles since crossplay and entire regions being able to play the game since a year after release, the game consistently gets glitchier 
 
the gameplay shifts between overly simple/basic to overly complex/convoluted from character to character will little consistency, you have braindead simple characters with no depth like Sol going up against incomprehensible characters like Asuka and nearly most DLC characters have some unnecessary meter or resource even when it doesn't make sense, none of which feels cohesive.
 
They're completely destroying their characters by completely changing core aspects of their backstories and personalities and etc which is most egregiously on display with the trio of Faust/Testement/Bridget none of which have remote effort trying to explain such core drastic changes with Faust not even being remotely touched on for like 2 years+ despite being a mainstay and there being several movies

The monetisation of confusing and absurd, they charge the same amount for all season passes but they have very different amounts of content in them, and they charge an absurd amount for a DLC that only has one single additional color palate for the base roaster which even had a 2 year exclusivity period, and most colour and deluxe DLCs and such are heavily misleading and sneaky not giving as much as they imply, and there being content only available through season passes meaning you should never buy characters or etc individually.
And the price for the game and it's DLC fluctuate randomly to absurd degrees lowering and raising massive amounts in specific regions with no real pattern, with there recently being being a change that increases the price across the board from anywhere from 5% to a insane 90% with the countries receiving the 90% already having much more difficulty buying games whatsoever.

And the community has massively gone downhill after the initial year, with constant toxicity, attacks, flame-wars, aggression, strawmen, hate, bigotry, bootlicking, projection, elitism, generationalism, and etc completely unlike the rather likeable and chill and funny fandom the game temporarily had during most of the first year. And while there's many high quality costume mods and such people have made, there's a sizable amount of drama and bias and inequality and discourse surrounding most of that too.

Overall, as someone who put several hundred hours into this game initially and really liked it for a while, it's such a shame to see how it's had the ball dropped time and time again in most areas since, with music and art being the only consistently reliable aspect.
There are still things worth caring about the game, but overall it's become such a mess and I no longer recommend it or have intention to keep playing.
I suggest looking towards one of Arcsys's other games such as Xrd or X2 or DBFZ or any of the Blazblues except CrossTagBattle, maybe Persona arena.
Or maybe you'll prefer some of the other great Fighting Games coming out around now or on the horizon, Street Fighter 6 is fantastic though you'll have to prepare yourself for abysmal levels of monetisation if you set your sights on it.",1623491855,1693118454,False,0,0,0.378787875175476074,0,True,False,False

I'll probably edit or delete this later, but here's a rundown of the USD pricing (June 2021 ~ August 2023), because the new ""Daredevil Edition"" looks like a mess:

The initial release on Steam had Standard and Deluxe options, but no Ultimate Edition.
Standard = base game (15 characters) = $60
Deluxe = base game + season pass 1 = $85
Also, “GGST Special Colors for Sol and Ky” (the EX color swap for characters *and* effects) was a special freebie that was only redeemable for the first two weeks (in June 2021). I *think* they temporarily brought it back during season 2. Maybe. I need to double-check that.

So, SP1 was $25. SP2 was also $25. Now, SP3 is $25 as well. Consistency. Nice.
The base game price became $40 (August 2022). Yay for price drops.
25th Anniversary Appreciation Color DLC (May 2023) = free. Who doesn't like free?
FYI, the Necessary Discrepency OST (May 2022) = music through SP1.
All of that makes sense, right?

The ""Ultimate Edition Content Kit,"" when Steam finally got it (thanks, probably-1-yr-contract-PS-exclusive color) should've been $15, max. More like $10. It is, however, $20. The PS4 and PS5 Ultimate Editions cost $100, which basically** added this ""content kit"" DLC to the Deluxe Edition ($85).
** PS4 and PS5 digital editions also had 3 days of *partial* early access back in June 2021. (The initial release of GGST wasn't exactly smooth.)

The new ""Daredevil Edition"" bundle info (Aug 2023) is confusing and horribly misleading. You're not saving $144, because it's counting DLC twice. It should be a savings of $43.
Base game = $40
SP1, 2, 3 = $75
Ultimate Edition Content Kit = $20 (again, should be much cheaper -- never on sale)
25th Anniversary Colors = $8 (should've been in SP2, let's be honest -- never on sale)
Total = $143, not $244.

-+-+-+-

My last point and biggest concern right now: there haven't been any story mode updates since SP1. I love the extra stories in GGXrd, which has three -- so far GGST only has one. I *need* more than arcade mode conversations and unique match quotes between *some* characters. I would be happy with the equivalent of a drama CD/radio drama, esp if it has the on-screen line-by-line replayable script option (I love that in story mode).

A lot of downtime - between matches, floor changes (evil when you try to get to celestial), long ending scene, overdrives ffs, you can get 50% tension faster than their animation, i want to play, not to watch something.
-- Balance... if you played previous games this is the same shit all over again, 2 balance patches in a year, plenty of broken chars barely get any nerfs yada-yada, asians can't balance, we all know it. At start we barely have any HP and after all the buffs almost all chars can kill in 2 combos, it's fun for comeback EVO moments or something, but not that fun in other cases. Besides when devs explained what strive strives to be - it was no corner lock, no wake up lock, no long combos with poke startup and year later it's sad to see, wake up lock is real, corner lock kinda not here, but when wall breaks it's already a loss of huge hp chunk and you usually die on second wall break and they ADDED poke CH's confirm last patch. Defensive tools using resource generated from offence, so attacking side have all advantages. (upd 2 years later. now burst gauge can be used in offence to confirm random midscreen pokes and steal burst from the opponent. And postivie bonus recovers it, so wallbreak snowballs even harder and at the start of the round chars have full burst, so easy confirms. Bravo. Why do we even have 99 seconds round time, should have probably cut it to 30.)
-- Ranking system is shit, you have 11 floors with more than 1/4 of the players on the last two and no one on 1-5. Then 11th floor is celestial and you need 5 wins out 6 games to get there, so with some luck almost anyone can get there (or get carried by someone, since you can't drop out) and with 24ppl in the instance SBMM basicaly doesn't work. Overall ""skill level"" is invisible (in fighting game btw) and if you don't use 3rd party sites you can't check it for yourself. So, basicaly, you have celestial, where around 15% of the players are and thats it, all ingame rankings is about how many matches you played there, best fighting game metric for sure.
-- Ping indicator ingame is great, but why we can't filter out ppl by it? Like 24 man lobby, there is 2-3 dudes with bad Wi-Fi/200+ms delay or bad internet/route and your auto battle option (no one in the right mind gonna do it manually) gonna challenge this same dude all over again, no matter if you or they press cancel all the time, do you know definition of insanity?
--Rollback connection is usually great, playable up to 200ms (if both sides have good internet) some predictions on high ping are broken like Anji overhead when you see low animation startup, rollback and you already got hit by overhead.
--And old problem if opponent have potato computer still there. You gonna be in lag hell together for some reason, but they are born and bred there, and you just a passerby. And on top of that - you can't leave match midgame, i would prefer this option.

The inputs may have been simplified from the previous game but the game keeps a majority of its mechanical depth. Things like the Roman Cancel and gatling systems make the game very rewarding for newbies and veterans. Thats not even mentioning the visuals and soundtrack. I cannot stop listening to this OST, every time a character is released the first thing I want to hear is their theme. The visuals are also absolutely beautiful, all the animations are spot on and very pleasing to watch. In conclusion...

The recent new mechanics such as wild assault has drastically increased the speed and possibilities for interactions giving a lot more varity to individual playstyles and decision making. Uncertain of the future the mechanic will have on higher level play but for now it's a good tool for getting genuine interactions and just being able to get in more often.

tl;dr: fighting games are a wild world of spending way to many hours investing to see where things head in a longer term, often or not this takes a direction that majority of players don't exactly enjoy.
However because of the high invest time the ability to refund gets taken away from you pre-maturely once you've reached that point where you fully understand that you just don't like the interactions the game's meta has evolved around. It becomes quite easy to feel like your time and investment has been robbed from you. I don't feel like getting better at this game was worth it as the challenges of the game aren't enjoyable.

Review below is pretty opinionated take on the interactions as personally i enjoy more fast pace decision heavy gameplay with a continuely growing tech finese scale (games like tf2/quake personally fill this role quite well as the more you learn and adjust to the game mechanics the more options open up over time and the more you can do)
Seeing as i haven't gotten deep into fighting games until strive (only slightly dabling in older titles) i always wanted to learn them, after playing strive and branching out to a few other fighting games i've come to the realisation that the way high level gameplay evolves almost universally in these games is in an inverted sort of funnel where overtime options and decisions get narrowed down rather then opened up, you don't make more decisions and perform more hard executions, you just get more autopiloted routes that are designed to cover other routes and you end up making smaller decisions that lead into those routes.
The reason to do this is to lower the amount of things you need to hon/focus on, so things that are overly general will win out against things that are very specific.
This results in games that don't feel like your playing against a real player but instead games where you are either playing against a sandbag that your just dunking on, or your filling the role of the sandbag as the interaction has been taken from you.
This leads to a very unenjoyable experience and it's an experience that is unfortunetly really common in the genre, games like these drop off hard because at the end of the day they just aren't fun for extended periods of time. 

Mainly because Winning isn't fun, and losing isn't educational.
After understanding the game, you don't learn anything. You just make a lot of guesses in an RPS system with a lot of option selects.

Personally, this game isn't for me. As the slow pace and direction arcsys has been pushing by adding so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ zoners to the game has made the rushdown playstyle i enjoyed at the start of the game, nearly impossible to enjoy at a high level now.
The only times i'll be able to rush down an opponet is when their a fresh install and that just doesn't make me feel good as i unlike most iwho play this game, i happen to have a moral conscious and i don't like playing against people who can't compete when i know for a fact that what i did was straight up unsafe and wouldn't work in a real match.
If you're like me, then just play something else (like tf2), avoid fighting games, they are all snake oil at the core.

I really really wish i could get that time i spent back, i feel like arcsys should've been paying me to play this ♥♥♥♥, not the other way around.
These games fall off hard for a reason, people in positions within FGC may not want to state it aloud because they rely on these games, but it's something that i'm certain everyone secretly knows as a major flaw with these games they just don't want to admit it and companies like arcsys have monetary incentive to make sure the flaw doesn't get fixed (how else can they sell more games and hype culture to funnel people into tournments under the thinly veiled promise of glory.

Aside from having the best visuals in any fighting game to date and an amazing soundtrack, I've been able to get several people into this game who had no interest in other ArcSystemWorks games because of the accessibility barrier being lowered. They even feel the motivation to actually go into training mode and lab out their characters, which is very rare for casual players to do in my experience. 

Overall this is a great game with good accessibility and outstanding online, and the high sales so far mean it's likely to be supported by ArcSys for a long time. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fighting games, casual or otherwise. 

The only real issues are that the online lobbies, especially on PC, are often difficult to get matches in due to how inconsistently matches go through, with player lobbies with specific ID codes being unusable at the time this review was written, though I expect that will change. Once you're in a match, though, the game has the smoothest online experience of any online fighting game I've played. (I forgot to change this when it happened, but player lobbies are usable now. The game does still have a few bugs in the lobby system, though.)

Season 3 Edit: This game got some new mechanics that fucking rule, and the online still isn't 100% ideal but it's improved enough that I've never had any issues.",1623905518,1692939338,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The music stands on it's own while also complimenting matches. 

The story mode not being playable makes sense, and it's there for the fans and serves as a great conclusion to the 20 year long running story. Still, I really wish it was playable... and that Jack-O was base roster cause like. Come on. In this context, it's like making Chun-Li DLC.

The core of the genre is usually only experienced by the minority that the genre caters to. The experience you have is entirely dependent on how you enjoy the genre, making it difficult to create a general review that potential players can use to gauge their decision on purchasing GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE-. I will be reviewing the game based off how I personally enjoy fighting games.

I found GGST most fun as a game to learn how to play, climb up ranked to a point I was satisfied with, and only revisit to occasionally fight versus friends or complete achievements. My enjoyment came from mastering game knowledge to participate in competition. I know very little about the single-player content it provides, but that is a result of how I chose to play GGST.

Learning how to play is easy with the amount of resources GGST provides combined with external resources to arrive at what makes fighting games fun faster than most games of its genre. The series has done an excellent job in simplifying mechanics of its past installments while still having creative applications to make combat fun. GGST runs online matches entirely on rollback netcode, making each match feel smooth despite distance or connection. Another great feature of GGST lies in its gorgeous visuals. Arc System Works are the golden standard for anime-style games, GGST being no exception to that fact.

However, the game's skill floor has increased over time as it does with most fighting games making its initial learning curve more difficult. If this will affect your enjoyment of the game, I would recommend playing more recent fighting game releases. GGST also has issues with balancing certain characters and controversially being too simple to control. This reduces the consistency of veteran players and its understandable to be upset when mastery isn't rewarded as much to those who commit themselves to the game the most.

GGST succeeds in welcoming new players to an intimidating genre. It's a great starting point for someone looking to introduce themselves to the anime fighting game genre as it is one of the most beginner-friendly fighting games on the market. If you can see yourself getting behind its flaws and appreciating the best of what GGST has to offer, I would recommend trying it out yourself.",1627880279,1692395330,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ranked system is bizarre, rooms are their own weird 2d platformer and have no built-in player rotation, Steam integration doesn't work, and the best option for joining friends is sharing 6 character room codes.

The DLC characters have much less intuitive counterplay than the base roster, and also cannot be used in training mode without buying the DLC.

Subjectively, I'm also not a big fan of the differences from Xrd. The game was made slower and longer combos were removed, but some of the aspects of Xrd that made it accessible (like the universal gatling combo) were also removed, which I think hurts both competitive and casual play.",1665538218,1691874653,False,7,2,0.457869261503219604,0,True,False,False

It seems on GGST i struggle WAY more to win and have to be trying as hard as possible to get a win. Overall, I'd give this game a 10/10 still for the quality it has.

at its core GGST is woke crap meant to draw in none gamers and especially none fighting game players. with it's fast gameplay amazing soundtrack  and wonderful graphics. and overly simple design. (compared to past iterations) 

so should you buy?

8/10 if you don't play FGs the silver lining is it's easy to get into

if you're a competitive player 4/10 beat on newbs and pad your ego. pickup bad habbits. just don't.

i will say the game can be fun if you're ""bad"" cuz you won't see most of the games bs.
unless you meet a smurf y'know the type thosends of hrs top player buying multiple copies of a game to make lvl 1 accounts n beat down for ""fun"" unfortunately this is commonplace in online team games and FGs.

won't even talk about the scripts/ block bots you see 1% of the time. for reference in my almost 1,500hrs i've seen 2 scripters. but only time will tell not sure if i should have even made mention of this.

Good game for beginners as well as it's very easy to pick up but there's not a lot to master at all and it doesn't actively feel rewarding to master either.

For older players it gives a new play style to some of the character due to easier to learn game plans and cool inventive characters that fit right at home with the older cast.,1690655205,1690655205,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Just understand that you will need a lot of resilience when it comes to news from Arcsys.
If you are looking to become a better fighting game player, This game CAN do that... but I'd recommend Street Fighter 6.
There is no ""ranked"" matchmaking. So you will either fight someone who is a little newbie, A smurf who just wants to dick around or someone who lives, breathes and shits this game.

The gameplay rocks, the music rocks, and the visuals are unmatched. Each character is unique and plays vastly differently from any other given character. Its pretty much impossible to not find a character that you like to play. Each track from this game has stayed in my playlist for the past couple of years and i find something new to appreciate with them pretty often. Another thing that i love about this game is the community and FGC as a whole. Because of this game I got to meet a lot of really cool people in the wider FGC space. And I gotta say playing at locals is some of the most fun ive had in a while. Sure the game is a bit unbalanced, and we're currently in a bit of a lull of content, but the game is still great and is fun to play. The online is great when it works, but getting into a match can still be somewhat  troublesome. Overall, guilty gear strive is absolutely worth your time.

Just behind it a gaping crater, so infinite in size that it consumed everything around it. As if I was falling into a black hole, the crater stretched and contorted to gobble everything in every direction. There was no horizon. There was no sky. Only the gates, burning eternally. I turned around to see a small light behind me. Beyond was mortality, a gateway back to the life I had once lived. Should I go through it, I could return once more to the world I once knew, live a little bit longer, do the things I never did, live a life just a bit more fulfilled. But that would never happen. There was no second chance, no cheap trick. The light was but another trick of the realm to torment those few souls with just a bit of hope left. No one would ever reach the light, for it lie at the end of the crater's infinitely far edge. To try and cling on to hope and make the infinite trek back was just another punishment of eternal suffering. I turned back to the gates and walked forward. As I went through them, the light behind me vanished. Past the gates, stood the devil himself. He stood still and patiently, as if he had been waiting for me since the day I was born. He beckoned for me to come closer, and said, ""Welcome to your eternal damnation. There is no nine rings of fire for you here as your punishment, just like that of every other unfortunate soul to come here, is that of emptiness. To wander the endless void, devoid of all hope, to let your mind go numb, to have your very being rot and fester until there is no more left of you to corrupt. This is your last interaction for after I leave you on your way, you will have nothing, no one to speak to, no surface to feel, no sounds to hear, no light to see, no aroma to smell, no food to taste. It will just be you and your thoughts. And when your thought runs out and your mind burns up, there will be nothing left but the silence echoing through your consciousness. You will rot and decay until you are nothing more than the emptiness that surrounds you."" He looked at me, expecting me to say something to him. But I said nothing, only looking on to the void that would soon become my one and only eternal companion. But then, something came to me. It grew in my stomach, spreading to my lungs and diaphragm. It crawled up my throat and flooded my mouth. It kicked at my lips, shattering my teeth just to get out. My muscles moved on their own, acting out of their own volition, freed of my control. My head moved up, my eyes met his. And as he looked at me, peering into my deepest thoughts, the thing finally escaped, bursting from of my mouth, flying out in every direction. His eyes widened in disbelief and his mouth grew to an amused smile as I said something that no one had ever said to him before.

The issue with the game is that it continues to struggle helping me find people to play against even with its active player base. The game has been out for years and its match finding has never been updated. The game has NO matchmaking. You have to enter into a lobby and find players to play with manually. Then, there are problems with connecting to other players, and there are players with high ping in your region because they are connecting from a different country since everyone joins a select couple servers. As a result, it takes you a long time to find a good game. 

You can find a game faster if you want to play ranked at a specific rank, because most players are connecting to the higher ranked lobbies, which the game lets you access at any time regardless of your current rank. Therefore, the ranked system also lacks skill based matching, so new players will have a really hard time learning how to play. Particularly because the gameplay loop of going from a match to training mode and back takes longer than even Tekken 7, a 5 year older game, simply because this game will not do matchmaking. You have to load into training mode, select characters, exit, go to online, wait for it to load an connect to server, find a populated lobby, find a player in that lobby to play with, all this could take 5 minutes each time or more. The only thing assisting new players is the community's amazing resources for this series. 

The game has a ""quick match"" option but this is not matchmaking, it simply puts you into a ranked lobby, with no choice of entering a casual lobby, and you sit in training mode until a person joins your lobby and walks up to your character in the lobby and selects 'play' on you. Not to mention they can see what character you are playing, which can making it so some players get more matches than others due to game balance and character popularity. This game makes it hard for you to even play the game if you want to. It says I have almost 200 hours played in this game, but how much of that time is spent finding a match and loading between menus? It would be longer than you think, the longest of any of the top fighting games available. Just play SF6",1689863039,1689863039,False,2,0,0.53125,1,True,False,False

I like SF but it is extremely unforgiving in terms of executions and even the rhythm during long input moves is not consistent, you might switch up the tempo right in the middle of the execution. So far, GGS has been really fun and more forgiving while also making a real effort to help new players understand setups. how and when to cancel, and how/when to combo, understanding these things can transfer between fighting games.

One evening, me (F22) and my boyfriend (M21) were watching memes on YouTube from his phone, something we frequently do together. He REALLY likes memes and quotes them often throughout the day, no matter whether he is happy or being goofy and even when he is raging at a game or genuinely heartbroken. One day about a year ago, he came home to tell me he got fired and said ""my life be like oooh aaah"". It's probably a coping mechanism for him, but personally I do not understand it.

Anyways, we saw one meme, a guy a clearly masturbating saying things ""I'm about to cum"" but it was spelt out as ""ambatukam"", and thought it was the funniest thing ever so we looked for more. There were more videos of him being edited into scenarios like him mourning the loss of his brother named ""Bato Khan"", and we spent no less than 20 minutes laughing nonstop at these videos. Afterwards when we went to make dinner, my BF said joking ""that's what I'm gonna say in bed now"".

Fast forward a day later, both of us are horny and head to the bedroom to fuck. It was great, but then towards the end, my BF said loudly ""ambatukaaaam"" and then proceeded to cum. I laughed along with him but I was a little uncomfortable because it sorta killed the vibe.

About a week later, we're having sex again, and he says them same exact thing as last time, but this time, he laughs ""just kidding, I'll stop"" afterwards. Well, it turns out he wasn't really telling the truth because the next time we had sex, he said ""bouttobus"". I then whining-ly said his name in desperation and he then chuckled.

We didn't have sex for about a month until last night. We were doing fine as usual, and he even managed to cum without saying any memes... or so I thought, because right afterwards, he said something along the lines of ""thank you for letting me buss, it's what I needed"". I can't even remember much of what happened during or after that because I was in pure shock that we would just kill the vibe like that again. All I remember is that we cleaned up and he went to play COD or something that involved him shouting stupid jokes and memes to his friends.

I do not have the heart to tell him that he isn't funny when he does this, because the last time I confronted him when he kept saying ""yooo that's sus"" every time I mentioned something vaguely sexual, he almost cried. He stopped saying that one phrase but still has about a thousand other memes in his vocabulary. I guess this is just my life now, and as much as I want it to stop, I love my boyfriend so much and will have to live with it.",1689375763,1689375763,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is a fantastic franchise, with a colorful and unique history, with every character being an incredible explosion of personality and care. The lore is rich, but never the true focus. In the series latest entry, characters and mechanics were streamlined, with many of the more complicated actions much simpler. At first I really didn’t like this change, but I’ve grown to appreciate what makes it different from the other games in the series. In fact, I’ve grown to appreciate every inch of this game. The more I played, the more I liked it. Even though things seem simple, a world of depth is revealed within it all. 
The characters breathe creativity and experimentation. It feels like you’re diving into a cave of options with every choice you have. Despite its small roster, it makes up for it in spades with originality and profound expression. The more I played, the more I understood. Everything in this game just feels right. Creating your own custom combos has never been easier or more enjoyable. I have to give a shoutout to the ‘Combo Recipe’ feature, which lets me save and load my own combos to practice in training mode. Within minutes I’m able to set a large amount of fun combos to try, all made by me. It’s wonderful, and It’s such a shame more fighting games don’t have this. 
The music is incredible, as with all the Guilty Gear games. Each theme is tremendous in it’s layers of meaning and powerful tones. They are all full length songs, with amazing lyrics and wondrous melodies. 
The game is gorgeous. It has to be the most beautiful game I’ve ever played. When I saw footage, I knew I had to play it. Each stage has so much care and effort put into it it destroys the competition. I adore the stages. With so much detail and such amazing art direction, it really feels like you’re in a new location seeing the events fold out for yourself. 
The online is smooth and reliable, with no issues there. 
The story mode is ok, but I see it as a general step down from Xrd. 
Arcade mode is fun, with some great surprises in there. 
And of course, I can’t not mention the incredible representation. I never thought I would be seen so well by a fighting game, but here we are. Bridget is a miracle I never thought would happen, but she is real, and she is amazing. Every word she spoke felt like it was coming out of my own mouth. Daisuke has taken a massive risk, but it means more to me and other players more than he may ever know. I am incredibly, incredibly grateful for his vision and amazing compassion. It’s clear to me what this game is trying to say, and it’s something so very special. 
This game, this franchise, and this story is dear to me, and has gone beyond and above what I ever imagined. To Daisuke and the rest of the team, thank you for making such an astoundingly good experience, and for showing the world what happens when you don’t back down. 
This game will keep on blazing until the end of time. Thank you. 
Thank you so much. <3 <3 <3

The empty precepts disguising good intentions
A clean page is blank page, never, never
Like a wave launching, we leave out the chances
A black page is a blank page, never, never

Get up before they reach you

I don't need to be recognized for everything
Don't take them down to the ground to a face to face
I just want you to hear someone's little voice

With each game and every totsugeki that graces my ears, my admiration grows while my sanity teeters on the edge. Totsugeki, a word that once brought joy, now consumes my thoughts like a totsugeki wildfire. It echoes relentlessly in my mind, totsugeki, totsugeki, totsugeki—am I falling into a state of glorious delirium? The totsugeki obsession intensifies, and I fear I'm losing grip on reality. Totsugeki, the line blurs between admiration and madness. Totsugeki, totsugeki, totsugeki—it reverberates through my very being, a testament to the totsugeki force that both captivates and unhinges me. I walk the fine line between devotion and insanity, embracing the totsugeki chaos with a mix of awe and trepidation. Totsugeki, my beloved companion and tormentor, I surrender to your intoxicating spell.

And let me take a moment to address the Ramlethal players out there. Oh, dear Ramlethal players, what a sorry bunch you are! Your feeble attempts at mastering the game pale in comparison to the totsugeki brilliance that consumes my existence. Your moves are predictable, your strategies uninspired. Totsugeki, it's as if you lack the very essence of totsugeki within you. Your Ramlethal is nothing more than a feeble imitation, a pale shadow of true greatness.

So, my dear Ramlethal players, take a step back and witness the totsugeki magnificence that surrounds you. Learn from it, for it is the true embodiment of skill and dedication. Totsugeki is the lifeblood of the game, the pulse that drives us forward. Embrace it, my friends, or forever remain trapped in the realm of mediocrity.

As for me, I shall continue my totsugeki journey, my mind teetering on the edge of madness. Totsugeki, totsugeki, totsugeki—its siren call guides me through the chaos, fueling my unyielding passion. May the totsugeki force be with us all, except for you, Ramlethal players. Your totsugeki game is, quite frankly, dogpoop.

Guilty Gear Strive steadily approaches its 3rd year of service. Guilty Gear Strive is probably the best example of a game released at the right time in the right place. With all other major Fighting Games slowly winding down and getting ready for the generational leap, ArcSystems swooped in and released what might be their best title yet. The new Guilty Gear looks amazing, plays fantastically, and is easy to grasp for players. Add to that a soundtrack that slaps harder than a fullscreen combo and you have yourself the fighting game that mainevented EVO in 2022.

[b]But with a new Street Fighter releasing and Tekken right around the corner, how does the most stylish fighting game stack up in 2023?[/b]

[h1]The Smell of the Game[/h1]

Talking about fighting games is always difficult because eventually, every newcomer will run into an impossible information brick wall. Frame data, 15-hit combos, and all those characters that have their own quirks to work out and react to. It's too much of a mountain to climb before you even get to a point where all of this makes sense to you. And just like Dragon Ball FighterZ, Strive tries to lower the barrier to entry by making all those concepts a little more digestible. But unlike Dragon Ball FighterZ, you now have options now that lower the frustrations of getting your ass beaten. It's still not perfect by any means, but Guilty Gear Strive is relatively easy in execution. And once you learn a few combo setups and how to punish, you can focus more on honing your craft without getting absolutely destroyed. All of this is just a longwinded way of saying, Guilty Gear Strive is a great game if you want to get into fighting games but offers enough for veterans to stick around. Especially since it foregoes the usual trappings of the anime-fighter subgenre. Characters with mechanics and gimmicks are so complex, a degree and extended training course are required to get a baseline understanding.

[h1]Love the Subhuman Self[/h1]

The amount of content in Strive is absolutely insane. After all, it is a love letter to the long-running series and feels very much like the grand finale for most of its characters. There is a story mode, which is more or less two seasons worth of anime rendered in ArcSystem's beautiful art style that you can watch at your own convenience. And you don't even have to fight in between major story beats. And if you're not familiar with the Guilty Gear franchise, don't worry. Strive comes with an exhausting glossary that includes the history of the entire franchise since its inception in 1998. An excellent training mode that comes with all the bells and whistle's you want in a fighting game, minus the actual frame data. And expensive list of missions that in egregious detail explain everything you need to know about the gameplay. Even how to handle certain characters and their super annoying abilities, so you can spend more time practicing what you need to practice instead of trying to figure out what you did wrong in the first place. A great addition is also the combo lab. Here you can practice and save your own combos and upload them to the games server. You can also download other peoples combo's for each specific character to practice in a self-made mission mode. As for ranked play and online play, Guilty Gear Strive really loves to shove people into its various lobbies. You can create and decorate your own, or attempt to climb the tower. It's not perfect by any means and as of writing, playing online and matching up with other players can be a little rough. But the matchmaking itself does a great job of putting you up against players of your skill level. So generally, Guilty Gear is bursting with combat if you're here for cutscenes and or online play. For singleplayer there is your bog standard Arcade mode. But outside of a number of bot fights with some little voiced cutscenes in between, it'll get dull really fast.

Guilty Gear Strive features a diverse roster of characters that only expands as the game's lifecycle progresses. And there is enough variety here to please even the hardest of critics. I mean who doesn't want to play an artificial doomsday device with two gigantic swords or the world's most excitable, buff 5-year-old? Characters in Strive ooze charisma, be it unique voice lines and animations depending on who they're up against. And that doesn't even scratch the surface, especially with those bangers they call their theme songs. Guilty Gear has always been a love letter to Rock n' Roll but Strive's soundtrack takes it to another level. Just look up the 1-year anniversary music video they showed at EVO last year. Mechanically, they all distinguish themselves from each other. Every single character still offers that signature Guilty Gear depth while also being relatively easy to pick up. Be it Ky Kiske's take on the Shoto-Archetype (He has a Sword) or Bridget's Yo-yo that makes for an excellent tool for spacing and lets her pressure across long distances. It's really hard to recommend anyone since all the characters promote their own playstyle, and with the Roman Cancel's the possibilities for combos and big brain plays seem endless.

[b]The best way to pick a character is probably just taking whoever you fancy into the dojo and messing around with them. Get a really good feeling for their individual attacks and practice their special moves.[/b]

[h1]What Do You Fight For[/h1]

If you want to get into fighting games or are just looking for something to cut your teeth at before Tekken 8 roll around. Guilty Gear Strive is probably the best fighting game to pick up right now. The community is still extremely active with a very healthy competitive scene so it won't be hard to find people to play and practice with. If you're coming in with no experience in 2D fighting games, Guilty Gear Strive is probably one of the most accessible ones out there (SFVI is a good option too). You'll spend more time learning and honing your basics instead of trying to hit extremely dodgy multihit combo's that'll send your opponent across space and time. With a fantastic roster of characters, plenty of support from the developers, and extensive effort put into the tutorial. So if you're looking for a game you can play for hundreds if not thousands of hours, only to get stomped at your local tournament in pools. There are worse options out there and at least you're playing the most stylish Rock Opera in Gaming.",1688838790,1689009262,True,34,0,0.738630414009094238,0,True,False,False

Personal story aside, this game is really fun and smooth! The controls are easy to learn and pretty responsive. The game is incredibly fast paced and matches can be 30 seconds long. The music is amazing and definitely a contender for my #1 favorite OST. The tower system is kinda annoying but it's fine. If you are someone playing a fighting game for the first time this game is pretty forgiving with inputs. You can easily do the inputs and they're easy to learn and master.

This is truly something that anybody can pick up and understand, but only those who actually take time to learn will be really exceptional.

Great fighting game with deep mechanics, mostly amazing music and good character design. I still suck but that's to be expected.

The good:
• [b]The art style.[/b] Everything looks good and consistent.
• [b]The music.[/b] Most of it is heavy metal bangers with influences from other genres. Very memorable.
• [b]The combat mechanics.[/b] Unlike some fighting games I've seen this one doesn't massively overemphasise flashy cinematic super attacks and it's much more about fundamentals, timing, spacing... you know, the good stuff.
• [b]The combat balance, for the most part.[/b] Some characters are objectively stronger (=easier) but not overwhelmingly.
• [b]The netcode.[/b] The way the game handles latency is fairly smart and results in a smooth experience most of the time, provided you don't play with someone 5000 miles away.

The meh:
• [b]A fishing minigame...[/b] really? why do so many games have one of these?
• [b]The singleplayer content.[/b] There isn't much of it, this is clearly a PvP game first and foremost.

The bad:
• [b]The anime.[/b] Yes, the game contains a full-fledged anime and it's bad.
• [b]The netcode.[/b] Yes, I listed this under good but there's also the fact you can get randomly disconnected without warning or explanation, matching with an opponent can fail in like 10 unique ways and the devs' attempts to fix this haven't been very successful so far.",1688625252,1688625252,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The online mode is decent, and I've never had any issues with it personally, but I have heard a good amount of folks complain about the servers not working. But, in my experience, it works great most of the time, and the netcode is solid. I definitely recommend this game if you've never played fighting games before, enjoy anime fighters, or just enjoy playing as a variety of weird and crazy characters.",1687975749,1687975749,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To give our enemies a smack down.

He makes it up with his heart.

His command grab is a work of art.

A hero to the common man,
From humble origins he began.
Born a slave and fought to be free,
A solider who fights for thee.

The mechanics are slightly different from other fighting games, in that combos are often ""discovered"" as opposed to simply stringing together 4 buttons and seeing which ones work well. It is much more about timing and much more unforgiving if you mess up a combo.

That being said, the controls themselves are not too difficult to understand. The special moves for characters I would say are easier to pull off than other franchises, such as Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter.

The character design is odd, but usually to it's strength. It's takes a second to appreciate what they are going for if you're not used to seeing tons of sexy characters, such as Roided up badasses and half-dressed Femm-Fatales.

Review:

It's a great game, the best fighting game I've played in years. The characters are well-designed and when you invest time in a character, you can unlock their full potential and experience the peak of competition.

As someone who has been playing competitive games for years and has a passion for fighting games, I was able to reach the maximum rank within 24 hours. This game is definitely geared towards competitive play, and while some balancing and macro issues may arise from time to time, I thoroughly enjoyed the competition.

The music, modernized versions of old cult characters, and combo chains all contributed to my enjoyment of the game. It's no surprise that this game won the award for Best Fighting Game.

The story is well-handled for a fighting game and the skins are decent, although I think better skins could have been created beyond just color packs.

I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fighting games. I haven't played a game this much in a long time, my fingers were sore from gripping the controller so tightly.",1683435360,1686457121,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This is one of the best looking, best playing, best sounding games I can remember. It's an incredible introduction to fighting games and is bursting with tool to improve your game. With rollback and crossplay it's really easy and fast to get matches too, and their matchmaking system is super smart - it recommends a level for you to play at to find matches with comparably skilled players, but it doesn't prevent you from ""playing up"" into higher skill levels, it only prevents you from ""playing down"" to pub stomp new players. And all of that is just in the ""tower"" - the game's equivalent of ranked. There's plenty of casual matches to be had in the ""park"" as well.

It helps filter out the casuals and people who have weirdo politics that want to be ""included.""

Gatlings are nonexistent and combos are brain dead easy (for the most part). Combine that with the extremely wack damage, 2 or 3 interactions and you're dead or win. Feels like 2D Tekken 7. The new wall mechanic is honestly really stupid and feels like it belongs to another series. Xrd had crazy mechanics sometimes but it lended a real identity and insane depth to characters. Strive cuts it all in half for the sake of accessibility. Many fighting games are doing this and that's fine if done correctly. Even Street Fighter 6 does this... kind of.

Street Fighter 6 came out a minute ago and it is the most accessible fighting game I've ever played. The option for Modern controls makes everything easier for newcomers and for some characters it's arguably broken. It's slower than previous games, interactions are extremely visually readable, most of the roster is extremely simple (not JP lol), etc. But that's not all it does. Certain V-Skills or moves from Street Fighter 5 became part of the core moveset for some characters in 6. This means characters have what they previously had and then some. This on top of the new Drive Gauge and it becomes a crazy deep game that can be as complicated as you want it to be. The roster all plays extremely different and have unique ways to approach them, as deep or as surface level as you feel comfortable with.

Strive misunderstood that depth means difficult and difficult is bad. Long story short, go play SF6 instead. Ryu gang.

WISH YOU DIDN'T SUCK AT FIGHTING GAMES? DON'T WORRY STRIVE HAS GOT YOU! DON'T EVEN LIKE 2D FIGHTING GAMES? FORGET ALL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE ITS SO EASY AND DIFFERENT! ITS EASY TO LEARN, HARD TO MASTER, AND YOU WILL LIKELY GET GOOD AND UNDERSTAND IN UNDER 20 HOURS!

Guilty Gear Strive is a godly and super fresh breath of fresh air for 2D fighting games. Its truly like no other with a character for everyone that plays so differently it almost completely changes the game! Not only are things easier to pull off in game play but commands are easy to learn and slide into, along side a great tutorial to do so. You will jump in to multiplayer and get rekt, but after awhile you will understand what you did wrong and grow, as you test and learn your characters you will become so much more. This is generally how fighting games work but for the record I'd like to state as someone who sucks at 2D fighting games this game has absolutely picked me up and taught me how! Its easy to get into and its so so FUN! There is an amazing online system with rollback net code that makes online matches feel as smooth as butter! I haven't experienced one single lag problem and felt like I was fighting someone in the same room! The tower and hub worlds are super cool and great ways to find matches nice an quick. As well as being able to customize your character with unlockables you can fish out which was pretty cool (very whatever but also very cool) and many ways to customize your profile too its all pretty cool. The game is simply just amazing, if you DON'T LIKE 2D fighting games AT ALL I STILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!

The gameplay is a like a 7 for me this game is good but the gameplay is kinda a lil off compared to the older games of the same franchise like GG Xrd REV 2 well like in the older games you can do much more than what you can in Strive example continuously combo on walls and stuff but that will be cancelled off by wallbreak in Strive which I understand that it's made to keep the balance and also gives the chance for the opponent to strike back at you but at the same time that could throw off the person who did their best to get them into corner. Also special moves for some character are reduced makes them easier to use but less effective in various situation but removing out Instant Kill could be a good thing since who would wanted to be killed right after did some amazing combos to keep the opponent at bay? The music as I said impressively done the vocals, the guitar and the lyrics as excepted of Guilty Gear franchise it has it's own craziness and style unlike other games! The visual are anime-like and has better lightning than the previous game, better 3D animations and graphic effects. I highly recommend this game if you're new to fighting game this game might be a lil pricey but it's worth it if you wanna start gets into fighting games, it's also worth it to check out the older games they might have harder inputs and stuff worse visual graphics too but their gameplay are 100% way better and harder once you get to understand them.",1685732613,1685732613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But this game is amazing I feel it is new player friendly and I have had 0 issues with just jumping online and having fun. The story mode is around a 5 hour 3D Anime movie which at first was a disappointment to me but then I watched it and loved every second of it. I would say go watch a youtube video for the story of the other games if you have not played the other games which doesn't take too long. I really enjoy all of the characters and their stories which caused a issue for me where I didn't know who I wanted to play because I want to play them all.
If you are looking for a fighting game that is new player friendly this is a really good pick. It does have things you need to practice to master I just feel compared to other fighting games this is way easier to pick up an play.

Let this be a warning of what to expect for anyone looking at this on sale during the Arc World Tour 2023. Some issues from launch took a year to be resolved. Latest security fix to stop anyone from being able to chat as you or crash your game seems to have broken everything else. Since they probably aren't going to roll that back I'm not expecting a quick fix.

It takes a long time to get good enough to know just how bad you are at this game and this one has been made easier to learn than the others. I played for a few months around launch, came back when Bridget came out and she's kept me here since.

I'll be giving some other Guilty Gear games a shot at some point but unless this one recovers soon this could be the end of my routine and I may end up with a different routine by then.

Update 2023-06-01: It's been nearly 3 months since a patch messed things up and a new patch on May 25 was supposed to fix everything but doesn't seem to have. Street Fighter 6 comes out tomorrow and it looks really good. Sadly this will probably be the end of online play for Strive. Even if they fix it later no one will be playing anymore.

+ Online play is smooth with very high-quality **rollback netcode**
+ Functional Crossplay between Steam, Windows, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.
+ Every character is very unique, with many archetypes being represented
+ It is more accessible so it won't feel overwhelming to learn
+ Amazing visuals
+ Amazing rock soundtrack with vocal character themes
+ Great tutorial in the form of Mission Mode
+ Fun and intuitive system mechanics that complement each other

However, there are a few cons you should be aware of
 - Sparce single player content
 - Game needs to take time to connect to network upon startup for online play instead of a connect to network function in 
     the main menu similar to Blazblue Central Fiction. This usually last for a little while, though Arcsys has addressed the issue and hopefully will continue to do so.
 - Lobbies are difficult to navigate in Online Match. Player Match is more easier to connect to opponents and seems less 
     bugged

Even though these issues are present and definitely of valid concern, I'd more than recommend this game to anyone wanting to try out a fun and rich fighting game. LET'S ROCK",1659996974,1685435751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

10/10 would highly recommend if u like fighting games and even if ur a little interested in the game. You should get this game. You wont regret it.

Update: Lobbys are very unstable at the moment and it takes an absurd amount of time to get a single game match. Its annoying because the actual game is fantastic but lobby's are dog shit. Its like fighting games take a step forward and another one back.

The most recent patch seems to have fixed lobbies. I've played about 3 hours without any issue. 

I would recommend this game to anyone interested in fighting games. It has great netcode with a large player base meaning you'll have better luck finding good matches in this game compared to many other games in this genre.
The character roster is very diverse, no two characters play the same and each character is strong enough to be viable for online.

I played a bit of Mortal Kombat and Soul Calibur when I was a kid, but Guilty Gear is what made me learn what plus-on-block and okizeme mean. Every single facet of this game oozes style and the fights are tight and technical. Characters include a black vampire cyborg samurai, the Secretary of Absolute Defense of the United States and his not-an-alien, a crackhead turned ninja turned president of the Eastern Chipp Kingdom (yes, he is the president of a kingdom), and cute pirate girl who yeets dolphins and hits you with a big fuck-off anchor. Among many others, I'd be here all night describing them all. The lore of the game is insane, and while I do think that +R had (a lot) better character interaction with specific lines for certain matchups and so on, Strive is still fine in that regard, I guess, I keep hoping the devs will patch in some matchup lines but everyone always skips the intros anyway so who cares.

The actual gameplay kicks ass, it's combo heavy but doesn't overdo it like some other fighters (Skullgirls comes to mind) where you have to reliably pull off 37-hit combos to actually execute your gameplan. Some characters are very combo centric but others have a gameplan that solely consists of ""walk up and command grab"" with everything else you do basically just being setup for your P-Buster. The online servers are pretty shit right now but the devs are reportedly working on making that better. I didn't have a ton of problems when I was playing this game regularly but it was noticeable when you did, you'd drop matches or lag out of the tower and have to rejoin. Playing against your boys on the couch is prime game time, just pick your favorite flavor of busted overpoweredness and pit them against each other.

Mostly I love this game for its style, which specifically is just taking something kind of cool so ridiculously over the top that it turns a bit cringe and then wraps all the way back around into being awesome again. Every menu and loading screen have little bits of flavor text that don't mean anything and you see for .8 seconds before the game loads, it's just there for you to ponder over. Every character looks awesome and feels awesome to play. Literally there are no bad characters, you will find mains of everyone on the roster because this game has a fighter for everyone but every fighter has a unique gimmick. The music is insane, some of it I can pass on but several songs I have become so ridiculously obsessed with that they made it into my daily playlist.

Buy and play this game if you like fighting games, or if you want to learn to like them. If you're a real old school fighting game veteran and you want something that feels more like that, buy Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R instead, or one of the older Guilty Gear games if you want, there's been quite a few of them. The franchise is about as old as Street FIghter, and in my opinion it has been heavily slept on by the public at large. It's good, especially so if you enjoy the admittedly cheesy but genuinely cool aesthetic.",1685150853,1685150853,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

From really bad online service, to terrible balancing.
Not terrible balancing, but bullshit balancing.

Characters are up and down in terms of strengths, similar moves are just straight better with some characters than others. Ramlethal has disjoints, but Testament, a similar-ish character does not. You hit bridget in her yo-yo and she gets hurt, but hit nagoriyuki in his sword and you get hurt.

There are absolute terrible normals as well. Nagoriyuki has a braindead closeslash arguably better than his 6P which should be the anti air, but instead, the close slash is a better anti-air.

The hitboxes are also wacky. Jacko has some absolutely terrible J.normals, getting hit by Nagos Close slash ON THE OTHER SIDE WHEN I WAS CROSSING HIM UP.

The balance and reward also dont make sense. There are characters like Jacko or Zato who are very very hard to play but their reward is lesser than other characters who get their high damage out of seemingly nothing! No setups or anything, just straight damage while other characters have to work for the same reward.

Thats another thing! Because of wonky hitboxes and stuff, and the high damage, the game rewards accidental plays by too much! Someone whiffed (not on purpose) their meaty, the opponent was ready to block, but because of the whiff, the animation looks like he is open, but the opponent presses a button and gets countered by another of the same button into a huge combo.

So characters like Jacko, Zato, Anji maybe and just generally difficult characters do not at all feel rewarding to play. The games balance is way to skewed towards straight fighting. Putting characters like Ram, Nago, Leo etc up there.

Happy chaos is probably the only character who imposes a very difficult strategy if the player can play him right. Although its only difficult in execution, once that is practiced, you get a very frustrating gameplay versus him.

And the game takes too long to try and fine tune the balance. Balance patches are far and few inbetween. Certain characters got certain reworks twice over (Anji) and that just shows how bad the developers assume the gameplay of the characters. With Jacko, nobody uses bomb. They made it easier to combo with but no straight buffs. I do not even think they play any of the difficult characters.

The game also has little defencive mechanics. For a Win-condition strike-throw type fighting game. It sure does love to not let you play. A lot of the mechanics of GG Strive is from past GG games, and I have finally come to see how they do not translate well.

In a slowerpaced fighter such as Strive compared to its previous games, it likes to showcase bullshit moments very obviously. Such as grabs not connecting because just maybe the person was 1 frame off into the blockstun. Or extremely obvious animations that shouldnt hit, yet they do. Resulting in a surprise for both players.

How can a volatile game like this have such hard hitting Rock Paper Scissor situations?
And then go off to reward accidental plays. It just turns out to be frustrating to see that your skill just does not add up to the game. You can see a huge shift in strategy when the opponent who has the flow suddenly looses it because he slightly whiffed a normal, got punished for it and now he is in the corner helplessly.

In defence, since there arent any defencive mechanics essentially, you make 1 single mistake and you are either dead or have to block the ordeal again. Yellow roman cancel and maybe burst are the only defencive mechanics. Instant blocking is a non-mechanic because it is too hard to do and no rewarding to try and do at all. Yet yellow and burst can be baited...

The game is sorely lacking in just straight strategy. Jacko, Goldlewis and the new character Asuka and maybe one or two others are strategy based characters. Yet the reward is very hard to obtain for arbitrary reasons.

Why pick Sin Kiske?!?! Why?! You have Ky and Sol who are better Sin. Straight up. Same moves, but better.

Strive is going to get burried.",1623714497,1685045780,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The biggest being they had almost a year to listen to people's feedback and yet did not do anything about the lobby system in the game. This is the worst lobby implementation I've ever experience. While playing with some friends in a private lobby, I often can't observe because the queue breaks for some reason, and unlike Street Fighter V you cannot spectate mid-match. The visuals are boring, and it make general match making so much more clunky than it needs to be.

Another lobby related annoyance is that you can't change your character without breaking the queue. The problem with doing that in a lobby is that by leaving the queue you'll be missing out on spectating the next match.

My other big frustration is just how long it takes to get into a game. It takes two minutes after launching to get into the game (where you'll see the message ""Communicating with server"" flash 60 times). Then you have to go through a similar process when trying to connect to multiplayer.

One of the main system interactions also uses a radial menu, which works for some, but not if you use a keyboard or a button only layout, then it becomes very awkward.

They also released with private lobby codes broken at launch, along with this ""follow opponent"" option which you see whenever you finish a match. That was just sloppy.

Guilty Gear Strive is a fun, accessible fighting game with free form mechanics that make the game complex and intuitive yet simple to learn. Be it a game to sweat your testies off, or to get drunk and play casual with friends, this game has something to please all

The long: I have a few hours in this game now, I've reached Celestial Challenger but havent obtained the rank. I have ample playtime on almost every character, I have a lot of hours in different Fighting Games, so I think there's some value in my opinion.

The Good: Strive is a game that decided to take the Guilty Gear franchise in a different direction than what is ""normal"" for the series. It's focused on making characters simple, yet still highly differentiated from each other. The new/refurbished Gatling system is the skill floor for the game, learning to chain a normal attack into another normal attack based on the button pressed. It's a simple flow chart of ""This button can only be chained into these other buttons"" which makes picking up the game exceptionally easy. It still has special move inputs, which can be intimidating to new players, but there aren't anything particularly harsh and the games inbuilt features for learning said inputs and their use cases is extremely well done. The game has what I would consider the gold standard for fighting game tutorials, so as opposed to me rattling on further, just know that this game will hold your hand until you're ready to win your first match

The Bad: Strive does not have skill based matchmaking. It has a ranked system in the form of ""floors"", which number 1-10, with a secret 11th floor for the exceptionally skilled. You get ranked a floor at the start of the online experience (Which I will get to later) and can challenge any floors above yours, but not floors beneath. This sounds okay on paper, but the problem is that the first 9 floors might as well not exist, as players tend to group around the highest normal floor (10) to try find matches properly. This means the comp experience is pretty much a blind pick. Then the lobby system for non-comp matchmaking is a normal mosh of any player, with no real information on their skill level beyond a profile badge telling you their ranked floor level (which doesnt help if they dont play ranked). This is fine for people like me who don't mind getting bodied for the first few hours while you learn, but I can understand if this is a turn off for some players. There's no good solution for it either, so keep that in mind. I do not deem it a big deal however

The Ugly: The servers for this game right now are in turmoil. They rolled out complete crossplay over all Platforms (Xbox, PS, and PC) which is amazing for the games life cycle. Unfortunately, complications of some kind have occurred and the lobby system is borderline unusable at times. The devs have on multiple occasions left empty messages saying they're looking into it, but only in the last month do I actually believe that they have a plan of attack. It's not the worst, but it is bad. If you have someone to show you what it's like, please look into it yourself. It's not a dealbreaker for me, but it is for a lot of people. This is also not to mention a rampant hacking problem that, while generally only being a problem for people of higher status (Content creators namely), can happen to the regular playerbase. It just locks you out of playing the game you paid for temporarily. It's shit. I have no idea if they can even fix it. The devs barely acknowledge it

Closing note/TL;DR: If you're here to play Jack'O because you saw her pose online, she's a harder character to play, but not as hard as you soldier. Worth
If you're here for a fun fighting game, whether if you're a FG veteran or a beginner, its a good start
please excuse the devs not so bright behavior, they are good devs, just slow sometimes.

Here are some reasons why this should be your first fighting game!

There's over 100 tutorial/challenges that cover basic fighting game fundamentals, and guilty gear strive specific mechanics. 
The game makes sure that they are easy to understand, and has a roadmap of challenges that it teaches you how to complete, gives you the knowledge for, and can get you from absolute beginner to beating your first small town local tournament. 

There's even in an in game player combo creator where you can create your own or test out other player made combos on specific characters so that you don't need to go out of your way to learn combos for other characters if you don't want to. 

 At it's core the training arena gives you so many tools to fine tune whatever it is you're trying to improve on no matter the skill level. 

Online PVP - With rollback netcode as long as you have good internet yourself, matches should feel smooth, and fast paced without the usual stutters all thanks to Rollback Netcode. 

If you're worried about not finding people or majority of players being too pro then don't worry about it. 
I assure you this game is still incredibly popular online and has crossplatform. There's also specific lobbies called the ""Tower"" where it will restrict expert players from joining rooms meant for beginners only giving you room to practice with others.

If you're want to get good at a fighting game and willing to put in the time. I highly suggest getting this game and completely the tutorial challenges from noob all the way to expert. That knowledge alone will carry you in most of your games, and once your ready you can start learning combos to min max your punishing game.",1684898237,1684898237,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+Amazing Netcode
+Deeper than expected game mechanics
+Relatively well balanced at high levels
+All characters feel unique and interesting
+Great visuals and soundtrack

Mixed (depends on personal tastes):
=Game is dramatically simplified compared to previous games, while some mechanics have been made inexplicably more difficult, such as ""Instant Blocking"", reversal timing. Seems arbitrary.
=Unless you unlock soundtracks, default OST has lyrics, which may get annoying
=Significantly greater focus on ""neutral/footsies"" compared to previous titles

Cons:
-Awful lobbies and poorly implemented ranked mode
-Game play may feel extremely limiting for fans of old GG games
-Despite simplification of the game, there is still a steep learning curve that may frustrate new players
-Story mode is a non-playable, 4 hour long, anime that you just watch. No gameplay.
-Arcade mode is boring
-No frame data available in the game; you'll have to use the Wiki/Dustloop

Overall: Highly recommend to fighting game fans, recommend to people interested in learning fighting games, but have a hard time recommending to fans of GGXrd/AC unless you are willing to keep an open mind.",1625090457,1684786120,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A few years ago I got into DBFZ and could finally get that enjoyment of learning the fundamentals and what types of characters I liked playing but despite the 3v3 format and fairly long list of characters it began to feel pretty boring with combo routes feeling too familiar and variation lagging behind as I got better.
Even though I had stopped playing DBFZ I still very much enjoyed the idea and looked more into Arcsys and saw that a new game called Guilty Gear Strive was being released and once I saw the unique characters and started getting invested in the lore and especially the music I knew I had to buy the game as soon as I could. This game is probably the best purchase I've made when it comes to games of any kind and I've been so excited to bring in my friends and start learning again.
Honestly worth every dollar including the DLC in my opinion.
There have been a lot of people recently talking about server issues but personally I've not seen any at all, not from the launch and nothing from the past few months either. If you do experience the problems after buying the game though I'd just recommend trying an ethernet connection or, if it's particularly bad, you can always refund (assuming you didn't play for much longer than 2 hours).

tldr; The game is 100% worth it from my experience and if you like the characters, music, or even just the look of the gameplay I'd say give it a shot! If you're coming from DBFZ I can say from experience that this game feels so much more rewarding to play in every way. Good luck, have fun!!",1684722308,1684722308,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Game In All
I love this game so much. I haven't had this much fun with a fighting game sins, I first play Street fighter and Mortal Kombat combined.
If you like fast paste fighting games I, %100 recumend this game.

Online
If you're worried about the lobie sistome I was to but it is pretty good, despite the few issues it does have witch ill tuch on more in to this part of the review.
the net cod is really good and there isn't as meany characters as athere fighting games but it doesnt hold it back.
and there will be more with the coming seasons.
the lobby system config sucks if your on flower 4 or below because there is never anyone on servers 3 and below 4 sometimes has people but rarely.
but you can just go to the higer level servers.
if you like at least 3 of the DLC characters or you wont the story extenchin I recumend getting the delux game its just a better deal.

Story mode
update after ive played the story mode
there will not be any spoilers but.
the story mode is amazing and raps up the existence of some characters like goldfinger and i cant what for the DLC story expansion.

update the servers at lower levels are more populated now so its not that much of a probblum but it is still there 3 and below moste often don't have people down there, i havnt bin to flure 1 or 2 but i would asoom its the same.

Even the 'bad' characters, still have notable strengths which can make them viable at almost every level of play. The games netcode is generally very good as well. There are network issues as of right now, which could be annoying. I can't comment on how its affected everyone else, but for me, it hasn't affected me TOO much. The developers have also planned to fix it, and hopefully it will prove to be effective. Overall, if you think the game looks cool and you want to give the game a try, I would highly recommend it.

I noticed that literally every sol player plays the exact same, like they literally found the same guide on the internet and all follow it religiously, its honestly really pathetic. I guess that's the nature of fighting games but holy fuck you guys are fucking losers.

Don't get me wrong this game was pretty awesome and a great intro to fighting games, and learning the game was the best part, but after getting to the higher floors, every game is the exact same. I've gotten to the celestial floor, and could barely hang up there, literally getting only 1 win before the season reset. I haven't been able to get back there, but I am still a consistent 7-10 floor player. I found (in my experience) that the lower the floor, the more fun the games are. Not necessarily because the opponents are worse, but because there is a very clear difference in their play style. Most players on floors 7 and 8 are playing from experience, and often don't know the optimal combos and they play from what they know, which if you are anything like me, feels good to play against and feels like a genuine game. However, once you get above floor 8, you can tell that those players are just try-hards who look up the craziest combos on reddit, and will just play footsies with you until they can pull off those combos. Those games are just straight boring, and don't feel fun to play against, like if I wanted to play against a mindless robot that pulls off the same moves over and over, I'd play against a bot. Those are the biggest gripes I have with this game, and probably fighting games in general.

Game overall is great if you can overlook the repetitiveness of the higher floors. Best things i can say about this game is that the art style is pretty dope, music is absolutely bitchin, and its a great game to start with fighting games, but once you've gotten 100 games you've seen it all.

Also Faust and potemkin are the best characters no doubt.",1633853394,1684292873,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

It's a 2d fighting game, think Street Fighter, Marvel vs Capcom, King of Fighters. Don't think Soul Calibur, Dead or Alive, and especially don't think Tekken.
There's a few 2d fighting games out there, and I think it's fair to ask of any of them, (especially one that's as expensive as Strive is at potentially $80 USD) ""What sets this game apart from others in the genre""
In my opinion, what sets Strive apart is how incredibly easy it is to learn. I have played almost none of the games I mentioned earlier. I didn't think I liked fighting games besides casually enjoying Super Smash Brothers (which is a very different game). Strive proved me wrong. 
The most ""special moves"" (read: moves with strange inputs like quarter circles) any character you pick is going to have is like, 10. A lot of the ""normal"" moves have universal properties, so you can pick up a character and have a good idea of what each button should do once you have somebody figured out. Each character plays very uniquely, sure there are categories of character, but I feel even characters in the same category tend to feel very different to play. 
I really like this game for its elegance, though I must note a few of my friends got into it at the same time I did, which really helped with the learning curve and fun value. I wasn't getting stomped by people who already know everything about the game.

I like my fighters characters/game to be fun,unique,have a good soundtrack,SFX,Etc. And Strive brings everything to the table for me in a fighter and much more in my opinion. This is my first Fighter ive bought in years that i actually enjoy. I played DBFZ (Dragon Ball FighterZ) for years and it got really boring for me after a year or two because of how simple it was. Guilty Gear Strive does not feel that way after putting 100 hours into and i already dedicated a lot of time to a few characters in the roster which was something i never did with ArcSys DBFZ i always play the same characters because they were the meta in the game but here in GGS there is a meta but it feels like every character is viable and suits a play style you would like. Every character plays,sounds,and looks beautiful!!! the whole game is GORGEOUS!!! the graphics look amazing and the soundtrack OH MY LORD the soundtrack is all BANGERS i had all the OST on repeat when i played this game day 1 and each song matches each characters overall theme,look,and even backstory and lore which had me interested enough to buy the last installment of the series since ive heard of this series before i can not stress enough how much i love the characters themes and theme of the game i might even get the soundtrack on vinyl because its that good trust me give the OST a listen you will not regret it. Im very casual when it comes to fighters but this game makes me wanna dedicate more time to it because of the fun gameplay which is not easy but not hard which is what i like easy to pick up but hard to master because there are some characters with a star difficulty ranging from 5 to 1 star difficulty so there is something for everyone. But overall i love this game and yes it is 60 bones to cough up for a fighting game but i pre-ordered and still regret nothing its so worth the 60$ and im glad Strive is my first Guilty Gear game because of its lovable characters,BANGER soundtrack,AMAZING graphics and overall fun gameplay if you want a good fighting game to play casually with friends or wanna be more competitive this is the game on the block for you IMO I love this game and plan to put hundreds of more hours into this amazing game along with more DLC characters to play and learn when ArcSys drops them later on!!!",1634633911,1684147145,True,2,0,0,1,True,False,False

I can feel the difference between this and the GG I knen, and doesn't bother me. Actually it is best to have this and a past GG games too, so you have more options in both style and characters. Being that I am a big Venom and Bridget fan...i kind of have to right now. 

If you aren't sure because you have too much love for Xrd Rev 2 or Accent Core, wait for a sale on this. Wait to see who gets announced next as DLC. Really all of the lines of this series are good, and different enough to pick them all up. Being that I started this series with the first Guilty Gear on playstation, this series has come a long way...so enjoy what it is.",1683698380,1683698380,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
