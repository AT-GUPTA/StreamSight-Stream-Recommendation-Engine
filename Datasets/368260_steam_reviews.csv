Considering the retail price at 60 USD I'd have to give this game a 7/10 due to the following problems.

Cons

- Great yet limited combat, the story is long and diverse but requires save state loading if you just want to jump in and play. A custom game mode like Doom Eternal, Halo forge or even Prey's Mooncrash feels like it would extend the player interest while giving new ways to play through the card based strategy mechanics.

- Gameplay balance: 
Our main character feels too generic, this can feel clunky when the story mode missions have mandatory characters making your protagonist feel like a watered down version. Having a choice in healing/dps/tanking would be nice to make the initial hunter deck more engaging.

The throwables and environment interactives feel too limiting in relation to the movement system (3 card plays, 2 redraws, 1 physical movement). There's far too little to interact with, for what feels like negligible damage beyond knocking back enemies into junk.

- Minor issues like pause button not pausing a single player game.  Allowing interface customization of in game notifications. Thumbnails for game saves would be a nice touch (custom named saves are allowed).The in game currency system coupled with crafting feels a bit forced for what is mostly skin loot boxes. Make my character look less like a psychopath when I'm sprinting around the abbey.

All that being said, if you like marvel comics and old series such as X-Men Legends then I think you'll enjoy the story and gameplay that only improves as you unlock more characters to play with. The story didn't feel particularly ground breaking (really wished they did the X-Men necrosha story arc) but the writing is pretty solid and willing to make the protagonist their own character given a few ""paragon/renegade"" choices the player can decide upon every now and then. As a comic geek with low expectations going in I'd say its a good buy only when on sale.",1708906384,1708910255,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It features a score of Marvel superheroes and you (Hunter - a hero you create yourself). They all live in an Abbey wich surroundings you can explore and pick flowers.
A big part of the game is making friends with the very talkative other heroes (all of whom seems to have a rather lot of issues) so they all can level up to help you in the other big part of the game - battling all kind of supervillains and their henchmen.

It really is a great game - I am right about now playing my second run with all dlc. To bad not a lot of other ppl will ever play it.

- extremely dialogue heavy. 1 hour of playtime was about 20% gameplay.
- the dialogue is incredibly cringey. Compared to a game like GOTG, which somehow managed to nail the tone of the characters while still being distinctly different from the movies, and this felt like ""We have MCU at home""
- there are so many long drawn out spell animations. No way to fast forward or skip. It gets repetitive and old fast. Imagine playing Slay the Spire but you have to watch a 20 second animation every time you play a card.
- The cutscenes can be skipped, but there are just so many, and it really could just as easily be dialogue so you could read and skip. 

The whole game just feels padded with so much unecessary stuff that doesn't respect your time.
The gameplay might even be fun, I liked XCOM, but there's just so much that gets in the way of you experiencing it that the game feels like it doesn't want you to play it as much as it wants you to watch it.

That said, the gameplay itself is PHENOMENAL.  Very fun, doesn't get stale (for me, at least), 10/10 on the gameplay which is the core of the game, buuuuut this gameplay is attached to a whole OTHER game, where you basically go on dates between Marvel superheroes and your oh-so-creatively named OC ""Hunter"", and it's kinda like... have you seen the movie Hancock, where one half of it is a very interesting take on a superhero idea, and the other half is ridiculous relationship drama?  That's this game.  And you can date the heroes if you're into that, but you can't fuck 'em or even kiss 'em, because the devs are cowards XD

This game is, I think, a 9/10 or 10/10 for a very small group of people with very specific overlapping interests, and then a 5/10 to 6/10 for everyone else.  The reception reflects that, and we aren't likely to get a sequel or even any more DLC for this product.

Which is a shame, because honestly this should've been an X-Men game if they were going to go with an OC and a bunch of melodramatic party members all jammed together in one mansion.

Drawing a fresh set of cards each turn that will all work 100% reliably creates an excellent balance of predictability and randomness.

While the turn based card combat is brilliant be warned that you will have your daily chores....

Pat the dog
Buy a gift
Decrypt the intel
Research an artifiact
Research an upgrade
Analyse a gamma coil
Spar with a buddy
Upgrade your cards
Check none of the heroes need therapy (you may need to do a random task)
Check the superlink - answer messages (which may involve another random tasks)
PIck up the random floaty bits round your home base that give you money/resources
Run around the abbey grounds looking for random reagents (and/or Agatha's clues)

Then choose your mission. Story or resource? The choice is yours. 

'Hangout'' with a buddy at the end of the day  (to get those special combat buffs, because you can only get help saving the world by being nice to people).

It's fantastic, an absolute steal on sale,  and a complete time sink. The social sim part of it can get annoying, although it's great fun watching all the heroes bicker, or have your character behave like a total d*ck in conversation when one of them has an existential crisis . There are flaws in this thing but the core combat of  annihilating goons and the occasional super-goon in tight arena's packed with things to throw folk into is great fun, hugely addictive and makes it all worth it.

Nice job Fireaxis. Thankfully it's not X-Com with superheroes - and it did deserve to do better. Shame we won't be getting a sequel.

On the other hand, this game interested me for so long that my stubborn refusal to allow other fickle and toxic gamers dictate my choices finally took over during a great Steam sale (~$45 w/ season pass iirc). That decision proved to be the right one.

Midnight Suns was 100% worth my time and money. That being said, I DO recommend buying it on sale and getting the DLC on sale as well.  My first playthrough with all DLCs took me ~102 hrs and I was also able to get 100% achievements during that time easily.  Turn-based strategy has always been a favorite style of mine and Midnight Suns pulled it off well with their card/deck-building system. Plus, being a fan of Marvel from a young age, the characters and story was especially intriguing to me.

There have been complaints and bad reviews regarding the so-called ""dating simulator"" aspect of the game and, while there is definitely NO romance feature to be had, I actually liked this part of the game. Truly, this was a solid design by the developers to not only introduce superhero lore to players that aren't avid comic book readers, but to also include an immersive reason to justify increasing stats and combat ability between the player and other heroes from a team-building perspective. Plus, the humanizing, relatable, ""behind the curtains"" view of the superheroes' alter egos went a long way to getting even more attached to the characters along the way.

The game structure has a day/night cycle which is beyond stellar for Midnight Suns. Admittedly, I did find it tedious and repetitive during times when I only had a short time to play and just wanted to get to the action of the battles, but overall it worked out great!

With the DLC, one run was likely enough for me, but nostalgia and fun might bring me back eventually.  If not, 102 hrs for the price was definitely worth it.  Ultimately, if the game doesn't interest you, then stay away.... But if you have been wanting to try this game (and/or have been on the fence about it), I highly recommend grabbing it and the DLCs / Season Pass whenever you see a great sale!",1708298418,1708298418,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I came back to edit because after I saw the game had released all planned DLC, I came back for another play through. As disappointing as it is to say with the DLC there are so many soft lock bugs, where the only solution seems to be is ""Reload an earlier save and try again"". Can't recommend in it's current state.

Story wise this is both a great story and great way to learn more about the Marvel universe. You get to interact with various heroes from all walks of life, learn their stories and even become friends with them. This is also great for shinning a light on lesser known characters like Magik or Nico. It really felt like the people who made this knew their comics, so many references to events or tales from their solo series are here and it felt great learning about them.  
Game play wise its a turn based tactical game with  cards. But you get extra actions and abilities later on that most enemies become fodder.
It did lag a bit at times and there were some scenes where it would just remain in combat mode and not go to cut scene even tho all enemies are dead. But half of those are due to my laptop being not that great. 
And damn that ending was fire but due to how poorly the game was received I have a feeling we aren't getting a sequel anytime soon. Which is a real shame since you can tell the people who made this knew their stuff when it came to Marvel.

It's trying to be a dating sim and a card game and I find the writing of most of the characters to be extremely obnoxious and the dialogue just drones on and on.

I feel we were robbed of generated maps (like xcom) to explore and use that environment to our advantage while completing missions with our favorite marvel characters. Instead, we get a static arena where all of the enemies just run to you, sure there are some environmental things you can use but it feels so cheap and weak. You know in Xcom where you have restricted movement in the HUB station and then full range of movement in missions? This game is the EXACT OPPOSITE. You explore in your main HUB instead of in the world. The male protagonist voice acting is especially dreadful.

It's a mix between a card game, a turn-based tactics game, a (platonic) dating sim, a walking simulator and a puzzle game. So many different elements that feel like they shouldn't go together, and yet somehow it really works, creating a very addictive experience that's hard to put down.


Let's start with the highlights:


[h1]The Combat[/h1]
Combat is the core of the game and what you'll be spending most of your time doing, so obviously it has to be really good, and thankfully it is.
It's pretty fast for a turn based game, it's immensely satisfying, there's a large variety of abilities and heroes that can provide interesting synergies you'll have to experiment with, and during the first 2 acts of the game as you constantly unlock new abilities and items, it's very easy to fall into the ""just 1 more mission"" loop as you want to try everything out and improve your deck.
You've got 2 different mechanics at play - the cards and the environment.
Cards are usually hero-specific and will have that hero perform an action, either targeting enemies, allies or an area.
The environment is what makes this different from normal card games, as your heroes and enemies are all positioned somewhere, and you can move them around to position for area attacks, as well as use environmental attacks that don't require cards.
The idea takes some getting used to, but it's great once you get the hang of it.


[h1]The Abbey[/h1]
The gameplay loops is divided into days - You start each day with your character waking up in the morning in The Abbey (your base of operations), and you'll have a variety of morning activities to do. Then you play a mission, and once you return from that mission, it's night time - and you have access to different activities around the Abbey before you end the day by going to sleep.
This part of the game has its ups and downs. Here's what you will generally be doing:
[list]
[*][b]Upgrade/acquire things[/b] - Get new cards, upgrade cards, craft combat items, apply buffs to heroes, heal your injured heroes, etc. General team management stuff. This is... fine. It's not exactly fun in itself but it does a good job of getting you excited for the next mission.
[*][b]Explore the grounds [/b]- This is where it starts getting a little strange. Basically you're going to be walking around a pretty large semi-open world, solving puzzles, uncovering mysteries, finding lootboxes (yeah... [i]I know[/i]), gathering alchemical ingredients like plants and mushrooms, etc. It's not terrible, and the game does go out of it's way to make it clear that this part is completely optional, but I did all of it anyway just to see what I'd get. You don't get [i]much[/i], but it's still entertaining enough to do, I guess. The major upside is that it helps you level up your relationships with the heroes faster, which helps unlock unique abilities that are extremely useful.
[*][b]Hang out with Superheroes[/b] - This is absolutely the weirdest part of the game. Have a picnic with Iron Man, start a book club with Blade, go mushroom picking with Wolverine, play video games with Ghost Rider. What an absolutely insane thing to put in your game. Strangely enough, it is kind of entertaining, even if it is mostly awkward. It helps the characters feel more alive, I guess - even though there's no real reason to interact with them ""realistically"" - the best thing you can do is tell everyone what they want to hear in order to max out your friendship asap. It doesn't matter if you contradict yourself - e.g. tell Captain America you support him and then tell Iron Man you support him too, even though they have completely opposite opinions. This never backfires, they never seem to talk to each other about you, so just... lie and manipulate, I guess. Just don't use this game as a guide on how to make friends in real life.
[/list]


[h1]The Story[/h1]
Ehh... well, there certainly is a story. And I'll admit, it does on accession invoke a ""hell yeah!"" moment when something very cool happens... but that's the best thing I can say about it. It's generic silly Marvel nonsense, with mediocre writing, acceptable-at-best voice acting (I'm sorry, Matt Mercer fans, I like him too, but he does his ""wise and stoic"" voice for the whole game - you know the one if you've watched Critical Role. It's not very expressive), pretty bad facial animations, and honestly a very boring protagonist whose inner-conflicts and mommy issues are eye-roll inducing.
It's not terrible, but it's far from being a highlight.


[h1]The... Microtransactions? Really??[/h1]
Yup. Really. They're only for cosmetics that there's really no need to get, but it's hard to not be annoyed by the inclusion of microtransactions in a single player game. This isn't a free-to-play mobile game, so there's really no excuse.


[h1]The Bottom Line[/h1]
I had a really good time with it. There's a ""post game"" stage after you finish the story where you can just go around doing more missions, so I might still fire it up every now and then when I've got time to kill, because it's genuinely fun. I don't see myself doing a New Game+ though.

TLDR: Execs mismanaged the development process, and devs salvaged what they could to make it a playable experience. 6/10

I'll start with the cons.

- Loot boxes that were clearly an abandoned micro transaction feature.
- Antivirus says this game's folder has hundreds of locked files.... seems sketchy...
- Invasive anti cheat in a single player game... why bother?
- Story and dialogue seem rigid and kinda bland.
- This is NOT X-COM Marvel edition (IT REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN!!!)
- Exploration is tedious and grindy. The running animation is terrible.

The good news:
+ A Card battler with map positioning makes for a clunky but unique experience.
+ I get to experience characters with which I'm unfamiliar.
+ MCU fans will enjoy seeing some characters outside their element.
+ Occasionally I get MCU vibes from the dialogue... it's hit or miss.
+ There's a shallow but present RPG factor.
+ Some costumes are unlocked through play, though it's a grindy slog.

Original review (Dec 2022):

I stuttered a little here and there. Over all the game is running smoothly for me. Maybe I'm just lucky.

Windowed full screen runs better than full screen. Letting the default video settings run seems like it improves performance.

Otherwise, the game seems decent. I have mixed feelings about XCOM turning into a card battler, but I do enjoy the game. There's lots of decent dialogue, though I'd prefer to see MCU Voice actors.

The complaints about the anti cheat seem legit, but so far I haven't had any issues... that seems like an industry problem that should be resolved ASAP, not that I can control it.",1670023225,1707270807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The card ability system is interesting but combat overall is not nearly as tactical/challenging/rewarding as Xcom 2. Unit positions and movement are effectively irrelevant. Your dude at the back doesn't have to worry about burning through movement to attack their dude at the back and vice versa, whereas in Xcom 2 movements cost action points and you can't do everything you want.

Oh and on that note, no hit probability. Everything hits, no RNG other than random card draws. So combat entirely relies on who you hit first, an attack which you know will hit, no matter where your people are on the map, and the attacks you're allowed to make are randomized.

First off, let's be fair...This is turned-based card game and not a tactical game such as X-COM where movement is everything: cover, advantages / disadvantages.

When you move in Midnight's Suns it's to cause damage using the terrain in a certain direction (jump, slide, crash). You can also move to avoid an explosion you want to trigger but where you stand on the field doesn't change much to who's targeting who. Combat relies mainly on chance + on how you use your hand.

If you are hesitant to get the game because you feel overwhelmed by the enormity of the MCU content... don't worry.. you do get introduced with basic background stories for each character and you get to decide if you want to learn more by talking to them. And if you are already familiar with Marvel, you might also pick up references to past events in the comic books, cartoons and films.


Pros
-----------------------
- Hunter is a great addition to Marvel's roster;
- Fresh story that kept just enough distance from the MCU;
- Fun and quirky super hero humour;
- Loved how each character has distinct abilities and animations + It's fun to swap the team formations to try new combos. 

Cons
-----------------------
- A bit long and repetitive at times (ie general ""side-quest"" missions);
- The Abbey grounds map is huge and there is not much to do in it (yeah its totally optional but picking up ingredients & chances to get new cosmetics = meh);
- Very verbose small talks - although reaching level 5 relationship gives you access to powerful abilities (ie via the challenges);
- The characters challenges are way too difficult and require a precise & specific order to complete them.  I would have preferred more freedom in my actions. Used a walkthrough just to get the legendary ability cards.

What's next?
----------------------------
Although it is unlikely to get a sequel (financial reasons), I would really like to play with a new mashup of characters set in a new location based around the Fantastic 4s and the X-Men.",1707170493,1707172471,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like Marvel and the characters in the picture, and you like XCom or Fire Emblem, you'll probably enjoy this. The gameplay is a little bit different--it's card-based, which I know turns some people off, and it's not based around things like hit chance (hitting is automatic when you use an attack card). But while the general missions can get a little bit repetitive, they're always introducing new twists in the story missions (that will then get recycled into the filler general missions) and it keeps the gameplay fresh. The social simulation is also great, letting you form bonds with Marvel characters that feel organic and sincere. There's no romance, which is a little bit of a bummer for me personally, but there's very much a sense of found family which I love. Also a surprising open-world side-quest area that's unexpectedly robust and satisfying. All in all, a unique and extremely fun experience.

A few vestigial aspects of the XCOM games feel a bit out of place. Mostly any timers for processes to complete which in 90% of the cases is ""1 day"". The card battling mechanism feels more at home in this superhero fantasy setting than in the original games. Same goes for the small battle arenas.

The game is not perfect and there are still small (mostly visual) bugs even a year after release. If you like the Marvel characters you get a lot of content for your money. If you prefer a more real-feeling combat the XCOM games will be the better choice for you.

As a die-hard fan of both comic books and video games, Marvel's Midnight Suns is a dream come true, seamlessly blending the rich narrative depth of Marvel's comic universe with engaging gameplay that had me hooked from the first moment.

First and foremost, the narrative of Midnight Suns is an absolute triumph. The game weaves a compelling and immersive story, bringing iconic Marvel characters to life in a way that feels authentic and respectful to their comic book counterparts. The writing is sharp, the dialogue is witty, and the overarching plot is a rollercoaster of emotions that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire journey.

The inclusion of the Hunter, a customizable protagonist, adds a personal touch to the narrative, allowing players to feel like an integral part of the Marvel universe. The interactions with beloved characters like Wolverine, Iron Man, and Captain America are a fan's delight, capturing the essence of their comic book personas and adding layers of depth to the overall experience.

Visually, Midnight Suns is a stunning spectacle. The vibrant colors, fluid animations, and attention to detail in character design pay homage to the iconic Marvel art style. From the fiery spells of Doctor Strange to the acrobatic prowess of Spider-Man, each hero's abilities are visually distinct and a joy to behold. The game's environments, inspired by iconic Marvel locations, further enhance the immersive experience.

Gameplay-wise, Midnight Suns strikes a perfect balance between strategy and action. The card-based combat system is a fresh and innovative take on turn-based battles, providing a strategic layer that kept me engaged without sacrificing the fast-paced excitement expected from superhero games. Experimenting with different hero combinations and building synergies through the card system added a tactical depth that I found incredibly satisfying.

The RPG elements, such as leveling up and unlocking new abilities, give a sense of progression and customization, allowing me to tailor my team to match my preferred playstyle. The variety of missions and challenges kept the gameplay diverse, preventing any hint of monotony throughout the campaign.

The attention to detail in fan service is commendable. From the nods to classic comic storylines to the inclusion of lesser-known heroes like Magik and Nico Minoru, Midnight Suns caters to both casual Marvel enthusiasts and hardcore comic book aficionados, creating a tapestry that celebrates the vast and diverse Marvel universe.

In conclusion, Marvel's Midnight Suns is a triumphant fusion of comic book lore and video game excellence. It's a love letter to Marvel fans, offering a compelling narrative, breathtaking visuals, and innovative gameplay that showcases the best of both worlds. As a comic book and video game lover, Midnight Suns has not only met but exceeded my expectations, earning its place as a must-play for anyone who shares a passion for the extraordinary.",1706801967,1706801967,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just finished getting all the achievements in order to give the game a fair assessment. 

Basically the game was its strongest when it was doing it tactics strategy thing and went off the rails when you were forced to do the SIMs portion. 

There's so much to go over but ultimately I didn't like the way many of the characters were written. Blade did not sound or act like Blade. In fact the entire cast felt like CW versions of themselves. Even Deadpool, who I actually didn't hate thanks to North selling the dialogue but 90's Deadpool would call this Deadpool a pansy. Logan's the same, he's not a happy go lucky free spirit, he's not supposed to be open or friendly. Neither is Blade and you have him hosting book club meetings. I... what? This is what that viral comic book shop owner was talking about. These writers aren't writing the character, they're writing themselves if they were the character. This Blade is NOT the Wesley Snipes Blade that I first got familiarized with as a kid. THAT Blade was awesome and badass and controlled the every scene he was in. This Blade reminds me of a buddy I had back in highschool. Nice guy, not a vampire hunting super hero. 

I didn't mind the story of Lilith mother of demons, but the ending was so anticlimactic it made me cringe, but I should have seen it coming. 

To that point I'm not sure how much the Hunter needed to be in the game. I didn't hate their character, but the writing definitely suffered from the Hunter being this ""create a character"" concept. Instead of being a solid character written with traits common to people of the 18th century you have to write them in this genderless, raceless, cultureless way that can accommodate any number of different background because ultimately the hunter is just there to self insert for the player. Which is a shame because the original concept of the Hunter being some 18th century pilgrim was unique and interesting and could have been played for actual humor and clever writing. Instead they give some lazy excuse that they were dreaming while dead so they conveniently know all about modern technology. A lot of the writing is like that. Things just hand waved away for the sake of expediency. The Hunter was an interesting idea but ultimately the development time would probably have been better off focusing on other Marvel characters like Thor and focusing the central plot around all of the heroes instead of just the Hunter, Bruce and Wanda. 

Then the other problem is it goes too heavy handed with the political commentary. No, I don't need my self insert to randomly bring up income inequality to Tony Stark while lamenting the existence of billionaires and forcing Tony to justify himself. I don't even like Billionaires but I dislike pompous preachy speeches even more and my Marvel game isn't the place for it. Marvel's Earth is not our Earth, our sociopolitical and economic debates aren't theirs. And that's just one example. 

Not all the characters were bad. I enjoyed Tony, I think Cap was appropriate, Banner, Deadpool, Wanda were all fine. I didn't know a number of them, like Magik, Nico or Robbie so i can't say if they acted out of character. And I want to say I understand that the game is probably made for younger players as the target audience but that's not an excuse to me. The original Marvel Ultimate Alliance was also targeted at T for Teens but didn't compromising on how character talked or act.

That's basically my thoughts on the story. Gameplay wise I liked the game, I like the card system, and when I started focusing on min maxing my decks and upgrading my cards and battling with them I was having the most fun. When I was running around the abby collecting stuff it kind of broke up the pacing. And on the one hand the game is constructed that you can just do mission after mission if you want and never have to touch the abby, but in order to do things like max out friendship with your team to get their ultimate it kind of then become required to do interactions, hangout with them, take them to haven sports, etc, and again that's when I just want to smash my head against the key bored due to some of the cringe dialogue. 

The core gameplay is fun. I was a fan of the XCOM games already so I knew more or less what to expect, ultimately what the game really needs is just one more season pass. Another enemy faction to go up against like Doombots and Drones. I know the game flopped so a sequel is probably never going to happen but it seems like the game was made in mind for one more update with Dr Doom as the central villain and 4 more heroes to round out select menu. 

As is, you have 3 races of enemies, HYDRA soldiers, Lilith Demons, and Vampyres. It does get repetitive fighting them especially because HYDRA often supplements the other 2's rosters. I'd say it probably needs a balance patch too. Deadpool's En Fuego mechanic just isn't working properly. It's not worth the baby sitting it takes. Maybe if environmental kills and shoves also counted towards the kill counter. 

Look I put 160 hours into the game, I wouldn't do that if it wasn't fun. If the woke writing is a turn off you can just skip most of it and I think you'd be fine. But I think it's a shame because a really compelling story could have been the thing that generated popularity for this game and justify further expansions. I'll give it a recommend. Not at full price but discounted I think it's fair.

I have never played any of the Xcom games, so I can make no direct comparisons. For me, however, it's most akin to a turn-based RPG. It uses ""cards"", but it's like this; Your ""hand"" is essentially just your ""move list"" and your ""cards"" are just the moves on the list. You get a set number of card plays per turn, and there are status effects that can increase that amount, for instance. When your turn is over, the enemies get to do their attacks/buffs/etc, and then it's your turn again. If you've enjoyed turn based RPG's, then this should comfortable enough.

The other half of the game is a semi-open world friendship and crafting simulator. if you're a fan of friend sims, you'll likely find this part of the game lacking. If you're only into the combat, this part of the game probably will be to your disliking. But for Marvel fans just looking to indulge in the characters and lore, I found this aspect of the game to be a delight. You'll spend time getting to know each character, having conversations with them, unlocking costumes, and more. I found the ambiance of the Abbey to be suitably creepy for the subject matter, and even enjoyed indulging in the ""witchier"" aspects of the game, and was influenced to spend some time learning about the real Salem Witch Trials.

You can get new abilities for heroes ie common, rare, epic and legendary.

While I have always been a giant comic book nerd, I have been feeling a great deal of Marvel burn-out with its incessant cinematic universe. I don't necessarily think it is bad, but if someone kept spoon feeding you the same slop for days on end with no reprieve, I doubt you'd still enjoy it. Point being, this game has charm in spades, and it has so much character that it easily outdoes what a lot of other products attempt to do with other established IP. Each hero and each NPC have their own personalities and wants, and each of them are almost cookie-cutter copies of their comic book counterparts. While I'm not an elitist when it comes to the MCU's source material and how well they are reflected in the movies, I do think a lot of critical character points are left out. For example, RDJ's Iron Man never once mentions alcoholism and, if we are being frank, that level of despondency is what really plateau's Tony Stark's overbearing playboy nature. It is something that keeps him grounded, something that keeps him relatable. Yeah he's a supergenius playboy philanthropist (his words, not mine),  but he's also human, and he's prone to mistakes and fuck-ups. Firaxis's Tony is just that. He's a human with mistakes and errors. Sure he's an overbearing smartass, but he does it out of compulsion, not out of character bloat. His sassiness isn't what makes him Iron-Man, and Midnight Suns understands that.

Sadly some doors will stay closed, no more DLC's, even if some are kinda teased, like Quicksilver. The story is as Marvel as it gets, but one of the better ones. A great one even. I liked the end. I liked the battles over all. Only at the end, i got a little bored with the harsh grind for the bonding points to get everyone to their best ability.

The story and character sub-plots are written extremely well. Kudos to the team that must have spent hundreds of hours putting this together. Even if the combat system isn't completely living up to your expectations, I would recommend the game for the story alone.

It's the classic case of ""play the bad game to play the good game."" Every time I open the game, I play to get to one battle and then get back to a hub world and the pace grinds to a halt. It would be OK if it were just the normal X-Com type power up activities, but you have forced story activities.
Many of the forced story activities are the relationship building ones, and it's a bad design. I shouldn't be making friendship choices in story based on if it helps me in combat. Even if I wanted a dating sim, I wouldn't want to be metagaming it.
The other power-up activities are poorly paced and fairly linear.
Combat is generally good, although it's a little confusing. It's a turn-based position-based card battling combat system, except you normally don't control movement directly. It's very gamey compared to X-Com, but that's not a bad thing. Like many deckbuilding games it's a fairly shallow deckbuilding experience. 
The Marvel heroes are presented well enough. It's not a hero sim, it's still very much a ""game"", but unlike some other games they almost all look like the heroes they should be. Unfortunately there's an awkward mix of hip young heroes (not that the characters are new) vs old established heroes. The Midnight Suns teens are mostly characters who are I least want to interact with. The main character is basically an Amnesia tabula rasa, something that happens in video games because publishers are afraid of forcing personality on a player. It's not as bad as other games because you have some elements from your past you remember.

Disappointed in the glitches and gameplay. of course this is only my opinion.

glitches to name a couple: defeat all enemies, but there are 2 left and the objective is complete / talking to people and the indicator still shows that i need to complete talking to them, again.

slow gameplay and load times: after every mission i must ""sleep"" w/b-roll load time AND there is so much talking, this is not like the real world, no one communicates today, but in marvel land communication is key, you can't stop them from talking.

I thought the ""card rpg"" style was interesting, but I am at the point where the random play just doesn't work for me, where I can only make certain moves a couple times. I am still going to push through this game, but I will not purchase another card type game again.

So i spent 2 more hours on this game and I am just going to uninstall it :) Even Geforce Now stalls and crashes trying to load into the game.

Marvel’s Midnight Suns is a fun turn-based game that uses cards for its combat, while also using the environment around you to do damage to enemies and complete a handful of objectives. When you aren’t fighting against Lilith and her mind-controlled hydra henchmen you are learning more about the rest of the team and understanding more about the new main characters origins. The game struggles to find its pace at some points feeling very slow at times. While the game looks really nice it also struggles from graphic and performance issues from time to time. 

[h1] Key Takeaways: [/h1]
✅ Wide variety of characters to unlock and paly
✅ Many lore items to collect and side stories to participate in
✅ There’s always something to do in the main hub
❌ Story pacing lags behind at times
❌ Missions feel stale / repetitive at times
❌ game loop starts feeling monotonous
❌ still buggy months after launch

This is the factor that made X-Com such a big deal is because you built up these amazing characters and stories-- but you knew every time you sent them out on a mission you were risking all that with no take backs, but that is absolutely what made the game incredible and is just the one element that is so vexxing because it is missing- but in spite of that, it's a cool game without question. Smashing bad guys doesn't get old and I do enjoy the challenge they throw at you in every mission- if they did expansion, the other change I would make would be the ability to just bounce around in the mansion/ base without having to run all over the place. And if I'm being honest, the mansion felt like it had a lot of potential unrealized- just ended up being a bit boring (heroes are really just going to sit around all the time and read?? how about train, or do things that are funny - Captain Marvel photon blasts the dryer when it doesnt work, Strange teleports Magik and drops her off in the lake mid shower after she sasses him etc.

It is a good and fun game, but honestly? There is A LOT ROOM to improvement. The idea of using cards is, of course, a good idea when you talk about indie games. It is less envolving in this case.

The game itself runs well, the gameplay is good and the wide roster of heroes with their own unique abilities and playstyles keeps the game refreshing. There's also a bunch of side activities/exploration on the side which is really easy to complete. The story in itself is pretty good. The world is ending and we have The Avengers, X-men, Midnight Suns and other team members working together from stopping this. The pain point however is that even when we seem to win, we always lose in this story. Up until the last couple hours of the story, we just take loss after loss after loss without a break and it feels unneccesary. I have about 56 hours in this game, the story is long but it doesn't help that inbetween main missions you're forced to do side missions, just to make the game even longer. You're also forced to go sleep after doing 1 mission which seems like a useless mechanic.

This is a fun game with layers of shit I don't care about heaped on top. The strategic gameplay, which is a mix of deck building and turn-based combat, fighting, punching, using spells, throwing enemies around, with a variety of challenge, protect this, attack that, survive this long, is all great. I wish the game was popular enough for mods to improve this; add more cards, speed-up attack animations, add more Heroes.

Separating the player from this good is a TONNE of cutscenes, talking, running around a dull environment collecting collectables, mindless daily chores, increasing friendships, etc. I just made Wolverine bring himself back from the dead, go beserk, kill 8 wraiths and soldiers and dogs in a row, and take down Venom with a combo attack. Why would I then want to watch him lounge in a pool in boxers? The pacing is lurching and the exciting moments are juxtaposed with too many boring parts. Too many loading screens. Too many holding down buttons to advance, taking way more time than a simple button input. 

Similarly, the core combat gameplay is good but stilted. Everything takes too long-- enemies that can split apart into copies have copies that split into copies and you have to watch each split animation play out every time, then watch their attack/move, repeat. Simply moving Dr Strange involves him going into a flying animation, flying across the arena, landing, playing a special turning around animation, and finally being able to action. Because it's a Marvel property, a lot of money has been poured into overlong flashy animations, and you have to watch every move go through every sensational animation every time you select it.

It's also a bit more simple than something like X-Com. You can only control a max of three Heroes, and tactics is limted to card draws and card play limits, also typically at a max of three. Deck-building and levelling a hero is a long, arduous experience. It's also annoying how the game lets you choose heroes, but inevitably you are forced to use someone who is underlevelled and has default cards.
The strategy is also half-centred on the cards and card use order and using card resources, which is fun but also detracts from the overall positioning tactics.

The Marvel crap is tired but there are some cool moments and it's fun and satisfying to pull off combos with familiar favourites. If you need a turn-based game, get it for cheap or look for something better.

It's sold using Marvel as the backdrop for some pretty stupid and unnecessary ideas.) For whatever reason these guys felt that a turn based deck builder was a smarter idea than just a regular turn based game with a roster and learned attacks. 

On the surface its a bright and colorful Marvel adventure that you just can't help but sink your teeth into. After almost 10 hours Im putting this game down as I've lost my respect for its creation. 

As aforementioned, this game uses a deck building component to present its combat. This is ok on paper, but their implementation of it sucks because there is no balance with player cards and availability. Only 3 people can play in each mission, which means you only have  8 cards per person for attacks. For whatever reason the game randomizes these cards, instead of taking a balanced inventory of playable ones. That means its randomizing 24 individual cards for play, and not 2 or 3 from each deck. So it is fully possible and probable that you will draw 5 cards for Deadpool, but no cards for Blade or Dr. Strange on any given turn. 

You can't plan around this, as card selection is totally random. On top of this the developers felt it reasonable that the player can only use 3 Play cards (Attack cards), 3 re-roll opportunities and one player move chance per round. Adding a re-roll option, much less 3 chances, proves that the system is broken and only serves to pad out a seriously flawed game-play mechanic. Again this totally guts player agency and the ability to freestyle because I have no idea whats coming or how to stop it. 

But wait! There's more!!!

On top of these unnecessary restrictions on the player, the devs have also decided to embolden every single enemy with an uncoordinated supply of reinforcements, buffs, and full on frenzies made to interrupt your turn at any given moment they want. 

Interrupting MY turn in a turn based game before I've finished my move. Wouldn't that be a blatant disrespect of the foundational structure of the games supposed deep gameplay mechanics? 

You are outnumbered, overrun at all times with hardship after hardship and none of what s in the game helps to alleviate that. 

You can only use 3 people per mission, and this kind of ruins the entire point of having a massive marvel team: Why get happy about people I love on my team, when there are so many more I CAN'T bring? 

It's story is pretty nice for a comic fan and I've loved meeting all my old favorite marvel heroes. Unfortunately I'm burned out already by the combat and game play so I kinda don't care anymore. It's not my favorite marvel heroes utilized in interesting and innovative ways. It's a 3d modeled Marvel game that uses deck building for its ""strategy"" and combat. 

The Heroism mechanic is what ruins the entire package for me. These guys have locked player ability behind the amount of heroism you have at the beginning of the match. What is heroism? It's a word. Seriously, there's no explanation of this mechanic. If you have enough heroism you can use most of your attacks, but if you have no heroism than the player will not be able to use any cards. They cost heroism. Why lock card usage behind heroism? Why not just allow the player to use the card, independent of heroism constraints? No one ever explained it, because they were too brain dead to bother.  More often than not you'll run into a no heroism problem, and there is nothing to do about it except suffer through the games bullshit. 

This game is a try-hards wet dream. If you are feeling a hollow nothingness at life, need desperately to validate your strategy endurance to your friends because you have no sense of self confidence or just existential bliss at simply being simple and alive, than this game is for you. 

Nothing about it is really fun but it is touted as such because people who love playing X-Com for whatever reason believe suffering through shitty circumstances and horrible strategy design made to look impactful is a virtue.

Worked for me:
1. Knocking people around in combat is pretty fun. You do extra damage when you knock them into another enemy or a friend, and you can trigger environmental effects.
2. Unexpectedly, my favorite part of the game was the Abbey, the area you can wander between missions. There is a whole mini-metrovania component to it, finding abilities that let you reach new areas, etc.
3. The UI/UX is solid, and the game does a good job of telling you any info you might want to know. Plays great on a Steam Deck, too.

Didn't work for me:
1. Besides knockback, the rest of combat is uncompelling. There are various status effects, character-specific mechanics, and environmental features, but 90% of the time combat is (a) squeeze bonus damage out of knockback and (b) play the cards that deal the most damage.
2. The growth/rpg/deck-building elements are a letdown. There's a lot to like on paper, but rarely do you make interesting choices or feel more powerful. 
a. Every character has their own deck, which spreads the deck-building too thin. After a dozen hours, most of my heroes still had basically the deck they started with.
b. The main way you get stronger is by leveling up (which increases your stats and makes all your cards better), but the enemies' stats grow too (presumably tied to your level), so the numbers feel meaningless. The low enemy variety doesn't help; punching a Hydra soldier with 80hp for 20 damage feels identical to punching that same soldier with 40hp for 10 damage.
c. The other stuff (base-building, friendship, etc) adds some nice variety, but it again lacks a sense of choice or consequence.
3. I'm not sure how else to say this...but the whole game feels like fanfic for someone else? Here are all your favorite superheroes, except they look and act like off-brand knockoffs. Instead of doing heroic things, they stand around waiting to interact with the self-insert main character, a superhero you've never heard of before and who is more powerful than everyone else. Whenever plot happens, everyone just looks at the main character and says ""what should we do, main character?"" There's nothing wrong with fanfic! I respect that this kind of story can be satisfying for the right audience.

Nonetheless, the tactical gameplay is super addicting and the fact that it is based on card based gameplay with deck building does not take away the possibilities of all kinds of synergies between characters, just like the prior XCOM games from this developer.

To make it worse, there are no animations to it. Only the Skyrim stand-still-and-yap. If you enjoy seeing Tony Stark standing stiff as a log talking about extra-dimensional threats (which can be interesting for the experience) then you're likely to enjoy the game. But if you hate it, and just want to beat up Lilith's minions, you are either going to hate the experience, or skip a lot of scenes just to get into another fight.
The fights are the best part. The player is challenged in the same way they are with XCOM, with the biggest difference being always guaranteed hits. Provided you are on a higher difficulty there is a lot of fun to be had in the fights. It is a shame that so much of the game is lifeless NPC yapping. The DLC however in some ways improve upon this, but that is just DLC content, not base game content.

The game experiments with the turn-based strategy genre and their efforts pay off. Commanding the team is good fun. The player does not use tactical luck, they need to design formidable plans.

From the never ending enemy rounds that feel like an eternity has passed until you get your turn again to the annoying base dialogues and the mini cutscenes 'opening' caches, artifacts and intel packs. This game feels like a mobile game through and through with better graphics.

It's such a pain to get new attack cards for your heroes, let me explain why i hate it. You have multiple quality levels: common, rare, epic and legendary. Ohh and you need 2 of a kind to upgrade just 1 to + tier. Then you have multiple heroes that you have to grind cards of different quality levels for multiple cards and i'm just getting sleeping imagining opening coils to get new cards.

The base 'activities' are one of the rings of hell, probably the torture ring since i felt like i was tortured with every interaction i did with this bad mechanic.

Should i even mention that this is a full price game that has a shop with credits and microtransactions? Yes, no? Who knows, but i am glad this failed in the suits eyes so they toned down the microtransactions to what we have right now. Ohh and the skins are trash.

I got this game on a huge sale because i kinda like card games and like the marvel heroes, but good god was this a bad purchase from my part.

When it lets you play the game that is. When you are in combat, the game is great. Battles are tactical. Card mechanics are fun. Finding synergy with heroes and decks is a great time. That is when this game shines.

Unfortunately, this game does everything in it's power to keep you from combat. There is just so much other nonsense in this game. First off, way too many different kinds of currencies you are supposed to keep track off. Each one helps you upgrade a different thing, or allow you to do a different thing. The game is never very clear on how you get these things. Also there is a whole ""optional"" go out and forage around the grounds for collectibles that is totally optional but you should really do it.

Also, everyone wants to be your friend. And it is annoying. Every time you come back from a mission you are bombarded with people wanting to talk to you, wanting to hang out, wanting you to come to their club, wanting you to listen to their awful dialogue. (There was a point that one of the young hero calls your character a boomer. And it lands as flat as you would expect.) 

It has gotten to the point in only 7 hours, that unless the dialogue is about the main story itself, I am skipping all of it. I don't care to hear about the characters quipping in an off brand MCU way. I like these characters on paper. But my god they will not shut up. And all of this extra crap keeps you away from the best part of the game. Which is the combat. There is too much extra nonsense.

This review is a thumbs up based off the combat gameplay alone. It can be fun to get upgrades for your research area and unlock new cards. But most of the other nonsense at the Abby is boring at best and annoying at worst. Also I've heard there is no romance option. So these people just want to be your bestie. And that is it. Which makes the whole thing feel very sterile. Like Marvel wanted you to like all of their characters, just not too much. If they ever make a sequel to this game, more combat, less everything else.

I enjoyed the game. The Abbey(the social/upgrade area between missions) uses far more CPU then it should and maxes out my old i5 4690k. That shouldn't be an issue on newer systems. Some people complain the game is too dialog heavy, but as a Final Fantasy 14 player I'm used to it.

I recommend getting the Legendary edition during a deep discount, as the DLC characters give nice combat bonuses and will regularly make comments about what is going on in the story.

That sounded pretty good, to be honest, but now having played through the campaign I can tell you it isn't that.

It's Hades crossed with Gears Tactics - or Hades crossed with Chaos Gate, if you need a more recent reference - and it's great! I've really enjoyed it, and I'm definitely going back for more.

Here's a quick rundown of the gameplay loop.

- Wake up, pet your dog. Pet the cat too if you can find her.
- Check your messages on Superhero Facebook
- Head down to the workshop to see what Dr. Strange and Tony Stark have found in the lootboxes from yesterday's mission
- Do some training with your fellow heroes
- Head out to do a mission
- Socialise with your superfriends
- Head back to bed to do it all again tomorrow

You can see the comparison with Hades - do the action part, then come back home and talk to people. Listen to them, make decisions, help them with their problems, hang out and do fun mundane activities... and get various bonuses and perks by doing so. Unlock new outfits, both superhero and casual, dress up your customisable player hero whichever way you want, buy upgrades, improve combat abilities, then next day out you go out to do it again. The game is a little stingy with resources to begin with but around the time Wolverine shows up (that's not a spoiler! He's the best there is at what he does, and what he does is: appear in the header image on the store page) it opens up and starts giving you useful quantities of the many, many kinds of points it contains.

The writing and voicework were pretty solid throughout - these things are obviously highly subjective, but I didn't find myself wishing I could avoid any characters. The movies are a big influence visually but I'd guess the comics are more of an inspiration for the character motivations and backstories.

I don't know if this will matter to anyone but although you do a bunch of romance game type stuff - hang out, give appropriate gifts and offer compliments - in order improve your relationship with a whole bunch of heroes, it's all strictly platonic. If you're hoping to flutter your eyelashes at Iron Man-senpai or make Majik and Scarlet Witch kiss, or whatever, you're out of luck. At least until the modders get hold of it.

The combat is a lot of fun. You'll take 3 heroes of your choice on the mission and each round will draw cards from the 8-card deck that you've selected for each of them. Cards come in various rarity values, but it's fairly nuanced: common cards don't become useless as you get epic cards - they're often weaker, but more generally useful, so most of my heroes still had a number of commons (suitably upgraded and enhanced, of course) even in the endgame.

You play the cards in whichever order to take down your enemies - plus rescue civilians, hack terminals, disable fleeing helicopters, or whatever the mission objectives are. Sometimes there's a time limit, sometimes not. Obviously though you don't know which cards you're going to get from turn to turn, so it's about making the most of the hand you're dealt and it adds a lot of variety.

A simple combat round might involve you playing some combination of attacks to soften up your enemies, skills to give you buffs and generate Heroism points, and heroic abilities that burn those Heroism points to do a big flashy ability that damages a bunch of enemies at once.

But of course there's a lot more to it than that. Cards can weaken enemies, or strengthen your heroes, or force an enemy to attack a tougher hero rather than the wounded one they went for last turn; enemies have their own special abilities that they'll use to spoil your plans; and you can also use the crates, platforms and explosives scattered around the battlefield to take out enemies without using cards. 

There's also a subtle strategic layer to moving heroes around: you can only manually move once per turn, but moves that are necessary to use a card - say, to punch that guy over there - are free. So you can use a card to run across the arena, hit enemy A, and then your hero is in position to kick that crate into enemy B, who flies into an red barrel that explodes and knocks out B and C and damages D. It feels very rewarding to pull off this kind of chain reaction.

The combat animations are excellent; someone has put a lot of effort into making them look and feel good. Smacking enemies into one another or hurling them into live electrical cabinets just never gets old, and they're usually pretty snappy - no long power-up sequences before you zap someone. All the various buffs and debuffs and keywords are explained succinctly with a mouseover so it's easy to work out what's going on.

There's also a whole open world section that you can explore and find resources for the crafting minigame - it also leads to cosmetic resources and new outfits - and solve puzzles, discover lore and backstory and so forth. I enjoyed it but it's entirely optional.  

In fact that's true of almost everything but the combat. You don't have to mess around with the puzzles if you don't want to. You can skip most of the conversations and cutscenes. You don't have to do any of the optional challenges or give people gifts or hang out with them. Even with the missions there's a Story Mode difficulty where you can make the combat really forgiving, and multiple Heroic modes to make it tougher if you want more of a challenge. It's a game that's pretty respectful of your time and personal preference, to be honest, so none of it feels like a chore. 

Despite the dialogue about the imminent end of the world and so forth you're also not on a strategic time limit as far as I can tell - I was able to carry on and chase whatever upgrades I wanted before I triggered the final mission, and afterwards the game quietly restores you to a time just before that in case you want to carry on doing missions and finishing any last quests. I took my time and did pretty much everything and I logged 82 hours, which includes some AFK time and is probably about the upper limit of what you might expect. The game ran smoothly; I think I got one crash to desktop in all that time and the autosave had me covered so I didn't lose anything.

Some minor complaints - the game sometimes forgets to delete enemies from the board after they've been KO'd. It's not really a problem, but it can look like you're in a lot more trouble than you really are. There are too many types of currency - Intel! Credits! Gloss! Three kinds of Essences! Compliments! Blueprints! Artifacts! - and that's before you even start to get into crafting reagents and collectibles. I got the Fancy Schmancy Edition with the season pass so I didn't see any mention of the real money shop for skins. The vast majority of the characters look better in their default costumes anyway so I wouldn't regard those as an essential purchase for anyone except the most enthusiastic.

Okay that got a bit long but the game has really impressed me. It gave me a lot of freedom and encouraged me to explore it rather than forcing me. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who isn't actively repelled by superheroes and/or turn-based combat.

UPDATE: 1 year on and now with all the DLC I've played through it again and it's still great. The new characters are fine; you won't miss out on anything really game-changing but some of the base upgrades they bring with them are great, and each one brings a new 3-4 mission chain plus one final boss takedown mission if you do all of them.

Overall this was my GOTY for 2023 by a mile, and I will doubtless come back to it again one day. If you're looking at this month's Humble Bundle and wondering if it's worth a shot, I would say it definitely is.",1674335355,1705253814,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The core of it is also a mix of card game and tactical battler - with big emphasis on deckbuilding.
Than we have ""friendship simulator"" that although mechanically is a bit cringe - gives a lot of story and builds characters pretty well.
Than the addition is the (optional) mini-open world of the abbey with some puzzles and exploring. This also adds a lot for the lore building and can be a refresher from time to time. 

As a marvel fun I find the story to be solid. Not trivial but also nothing revolutionary - yet another apocalypse scenario :P Although you seam to have a lot of dialogue options It doesn't seam to impact much - and afaik the ending is always the same. 

As for the core of the game I found it a lot of fun. Possibility (or often necessity) to shuffle the  team made battles not to feel boring or repeatable. 

The overall quality is typical AA game although sometimes there is some junky hiccups with dialogues. Also annoying factor is that you often find out about something and can't use it in dialogues but well - the rpg aspect is just a minigame so I can't hold it against them for it not being super developed. 

I think this is an amazing treat for marvel fans. If you want to only focus on the strategy part I think you will find much better titles - because treat here is all the sub-games coexisting together to build up story and characters and that is ofc directed towards marvel fans.

I'm probably halfway through the game, playing on medium difficulty, and most combat missions play exactly the same: keep chaining one-shots on weak enemies while you save up resources to deal massive damage to the important enemies. Remember when XCOM: Chimera Squad cut some mechanics and a few people complained that it's too simple? Well, this is Chimera Squad cut down by about 70%. In its place, you can have a parasocial relationship with the entire fucking Marvel back catalogue, and sometimes collect some fucking mushrooms for them.

Theoretically there are some other mechanics with various forms of buff, debuff, buildup and payoff, but because most encounters last 3-6 turns and your hand is (mostly) randomly drawn, you barely ever get to plan a turn ahead. Oh, you want to stack bleed on enemies as Blade, and then expunge that for extra damage? Sorry, your bleed card didn't draw, and it's best to focus fire anyway because nobody ever misses and your positioning doesn't matter (apart from telegraphed AOE damage).

It's as if someone designed a potentially great combat system, and then someone else realised that there's not enough time for idle chatter with squad members between missions, so they made all missions laughably short. I could try a higher difficulty but I expect I'd just have to try harder to finish in the 3-6 turns or die.

Which is another problem in itself: the combat is (or could be) decent, the dialogue at the base is fairly well-written (for a video game) and sometimes funny - clearly a labour of love, even if there's a bit much of it - but having it all portioned into alternating 10-minute chunks is constant whiplash. Just as you're getting into one, you're ejected into the other.

The Abbey exploration part is at the ""my first Unreal Engine game"" level of quality and can fuck right off into oblivion.

All in all, an interesting project with a huge breadth of stuff, pulled in multiple directions by the AAA requirement to be accessible, its creators' strategy pedigree, and being licensed from Marvel.

I hate to call this or any of my reviews a “review”; I think reviewing gaming or anything takes a genuine skill. One that I do not have. That being said, let me give you my two cents if you want them =)

I think this game is okay. That’s about it, it never does anything so well as to really be worth the effort for me which is why I’ll be leaving the game at the halfway point in act two. I still recommend this game, especially if you have done your research and you think this looks cool. It’s defiantly not a bad game, but it’s not great ether. For me, the problem is that the game never does anything that well or anything that feels super interesting to me. That’s important, to me.

The weakness I see is that game focuses on the story and the “sim” or “dating sim” aspects. Basically, the focus is more on talking to heroes in the abbey and on the narrative as a whole. Whereas, the actual RPG/tactical combat (or whatever you’d call this gameplay) is not really the focus.

My first problem is that the story and all the talking and the sim is proportionally too much compared to actual gameplay. It seems to me you do more talking and managing the abbey than actual superheroing and fighting. What I don’t like is that the story is only okay, and often in cut scenes portrayed poorly. Hunter is supposed to be a legend, but kind of sucks, and so does the other heroes. At lease in the cut scenes. Add to that plot devices such as mind controlled superheroes and overpower super villains, and you got some of my least favorite things about superhero stories.

However, if you like the story and don’t mind the plot devices or the “mediocre” efforts of our heroes in the cut scenes and such; this should not be a problem for you.

My second problem, is that combat is too watered down. The cards are fine, I was scared about that, but it hardly feels like a card game and more like a turn-based game. What I don’t like about combat is its simplicity. It just does not have the “fun” of something like Triangle Strategy, Xcom or Fire Emblem. You see all of these franchises have strategy and turn-based elements, but Midnight Suns just don’t have the gameplay to support a 30–70-hour game.

Ultimately, this feels like a dressed up mobile game if you ask me. That being said, what the game offers is pretty neat and superheroes are always rad. However, like I stated in the beginning; I don’t feel like the game does any of its elements well enough for me to want to push through. That, and the ratio of “simming” and managing takes too much time compared to fighting and actually playing the game.

I resisted this game for a year, and then I finally gave it a shoot after I saw some of it on an old, random Kyle Bosman YouTube re-stream. I should have trusted my gut and stayed away, but maybe you shouldn’t? Just, try to make sure that you really are into this. Hell, it was a blast to power up Blade and mess around a bit, it’s f-ing BLADE in a modern video game. That’s was at least wroth a try for me =)

Having said that, I would only pick this up on a sale due to some issues that bother me at the base price point (Got mine 50% off).

- Friendships are a lot of work, and there's nothing in game to mark what each hero wants. Use the wiki and save yourself time. Don't worry if you don't have a lot of epic/legendary gifts since the game will give tons later on.

- A lot of heroes aren't going to be available for quite some time. This can be bad if you're stuck waiting for your favourites. I wouldn't have minded this if there were enough card choices for each hero to have multiple decks, which brings me to my next point.

- Very limited options for making decks. Each hero only has 4 basics, 3 rares, 2 epics, and 1 legendary (Except for your custom character, The Hunter). As someone who enjoys the superheroes, I didn't use The Hunter if I didn't have to. I noticed that each hero more or less needs to play as the game wants which was strange for a card battle game. I'd rather have fewer heroes and more build options per hero since you spend.

Day and night cycle, time is spent in turn based mission arenas and in the abbey. I am 119 hours in and I am still unlocking mechanics via research

Split between the non combat abbey(research,relationships, gathering materials, unlocking chests, collectables, light puzzle solving,lore, training and sparring,material conversion, unattended solo hero missions\tasks) and combat based arena missions(turn based, card based, mission by mission adjustable difficulty) 

I recommend to always be researching I am still unlocking new mechanics(forge research) even with this many hours in, I am still getting things to unlock that benefits to combat and the various resources you get.

That said, it was what I was looking for. I enjoyed this card game a lot more than Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering because it was infused with lore and acting. Its a PVE card game and enemies are a bit dumb or predictable. It works for me, but for others that may not work as well. There is a lot of lore and narrative. As for the strategy, it works for me. I really enjoyed improving their cards, and grinding (That said I installed some mods after 75 hours to avoid grinding as much). Yes, its a game where the game loop is fun enough that grinding was not annoying, rather enjoyable. I like XCOM 2 a lot, but I understand why the changes in game type or probably necessary, moving around like XCOM 2 just doesn't make sense with super heroes at least not to me. This style made more sense to me while it also kept it strategic. You have a deck of 8 per character and some combo cards so around 26 cards per encounter. If you restart the match, the cards still show up in the same order so its not fully random at least not if you restart a match. I found it easy to spend time in this game, and the story so far (76 hours and only in act 2) to be pretty good. If you like turn-based and super heroes or games like Fire Emblem, or games with card decks this is worth playing. It was stable, didn't crash for me with an old laptop with a 1060 GTX.

Pros:

Diverse and Iconic Superhero Roster:
Marvel's Midnight Suns boasts an impressive lineup of iconic superheroes, bringing together fan-favorites like Wolverine, Iron Man, and Captain America, along with some lesser-known characters. The diverse cast allows players to mix and match their favorite heroes, creating unique and exciting team combinations.

Engaging and Strategic Combat:
The tactical turn-based combat system in Midnight Suns is a highlight, providing a deep and engaging experience. The variety of superhero abilities, synergies, and team-based tactics keep the gameplay fresh and challenging. Players will find themselves strategically planning each move to maximize their team's effectiveness against the sinister forces they face.

Stunning Visuals and Immersive Environments:
Midnight Suns delivers on the visual front, with stunning graphics and immersive environments that capture the essence of the Marvel universe. From the dark and mystical atmosphere of The Forge to the vibrant and dynamic battlefields, the game's visuals enhance the overall superhero experience.

Compelling Storyline and Character Development:
The game features a rich narrative that explores the struggle between supernatural forces and Earth's mightiest heroes. The character development is well-executed, delving into the personal stories of the superheroes and their interactions with one another. The storyline keeps players invested, eager to uncover the mysteries that unfold as they progress through the game.

Innovative Card-Based Abilities System:
The introduction of a card-based abilities system adds a layer of strategy to the gameplay. Players collect and customize their decks, allowing for a personalized approach to combat. This innovative system enhances the overall experience and encourages experimentation with different playstyles.

Cons:

Uninspiring Dating System:
One downside to Midnight Suns is the inclusion of a dating system that, unfortunately, falls short of expectations. The interactions with superheroes feel forced and lack the depth needed to make this feature enjoyable. It may come across as a distraction rather than a meaningful addition to the game.

Repetitive Dialogue in The Forge:
While The Forge serves as a central hub for the heroes, providing a place for them to interact, the repetitive lines of dialogue can become tedious. After a while, players may find themselves skipping through conversations, missing potential character development moments due to the monotony of the dialogue.

Lack of Direct Character Leveling:
Midnight Suns deviates from the direct character leveling system found in games like X-Com. Instead, it opts for a card-based progression system, which might not appeal to players who prefer a more straightforward approach to character growth. The absence of direct level-up mechanics may leave some longing for the familiarity of traditional RPG systems.

Marvel's Midnight Suns delivers a superhero spectacle with a captivating storyline, strategic combat, and an impressive roster of characters. While the dating system and repetitive dialogue in The Forge could use improvement, and the unconventional leveling system may not suit everyone's taste, the overall experience is a thrilling adventure for Marvel fans and strategy game enthusiasts alike.",1704839301,1704839301,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

This is a strange mix of a superhero RPG and turn-based card combat. The latter something i am generally not a fan of, but turned out to be pretty good. Most characters feels really different and there is a lot of depth to combinations, crafting and experimenting, and trying to deal with the drawn cards.  And while the combat is pretty good, the story is pretty amazing. Some of it felt a bit predictable, but it was a solid story and - especially with the DLC - there were enough curveballs to keep things amazing.

The final part of is the character, and that is the greatest strength of the game. You get to know and befriend 16 characters and they are all interesting. You get to hang out with them in group and one-on-one. The major NPCs were amazing, even if you don't get to hang out with them in the same way, but pretty much everyone have character growth. The main character was pretty good too, and i felt the relationship to the NPC was great too. 

Overall: 5/5

Overall few i have very few issues with the game, and they are minor:

Crashes.
The games really doesn't like if you skip the startup with the Firaxis logo intro. I think i had 11 crashes there, apart from that i have had no crashes or any other issues. You can tab out with issue. So pretty much a non-issue.

""I need more""
So having spent a lot of quality time in the game i think  i would love more. I felt i got good value for money. Disclaimer: i got it for 70% off which is definitely a steal. I would have loved to play a DLC or a sequel and paid for it too. I need more. Not sure how much replay value there is sadly, because once you have gotten all characters and have gotten their friendship level up there isn't much left apart from the same story missions and same random missions.

TL;DR
An amazing RPG where you get to hang out and befriend amazingly written superheroes, good combat and a great story. 5/5",1704792208,1704792208,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Must play at 1080p for the fonts to be readable. They are too small at higher resolutions. They are unreadable at 4k. UI Scaling doesn't let you go high enough to compensate.
- Maybe a little too much talking in between missions. This one is subjective.

If you are a fan of marvel AND turn-based combat, I think you will really like this game. It's not a ""must play"" or anything, but it is a quality product. My biggest problem with the game is definitely the UI Scaling though. Developers, please don't do this again. The minimum font size at 4k should be 54px, and probably much larger than that honestly in most cases.

If you like Marvel, Marvel Comics, or the MCU I think you'll enjoy this game. Outside of Spider-Man 2, I don't think you can come closer to feeling like a super-hero then this. You can have a lot of fun outfitting & interacting with your team & the dialogue is surprisingly good. Battles are fun, impressive, & addictive. Feels like a comic with the production quality of a Marvel movie. Give it a try, bub.

+ gorgeous battle graphics & animations
+ solid voice acting & dialogue 
+ interesting & fun card game dynamics
+ upgrade cards/base/appearances
+ excellent stable of characters
+ mystical/demonic/undead story theme; think ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""

- too many things you need to collect & upgrade

It brings a lot of dialogue based story and related character progression, similar to Mass Effect or Persona. It also brings a small amount of exploration. If all of that sounds appealing, then this is pretty much the perfect game. Clearly, a lot of attention and care went into every aspect of its design.

Personality wise, the characters are super lively. Very entertaining the entire time through to be sure. However, they do seem to forget that you have spoken to others about certain plot points at times.

Gameplay: If you saw Firaxis and were thinking XCOM, this is like....XCOM-lite. There's still definitely some strategy and planning in mind, but it's not nearly as deep. Not to say that's a bad thing, but setting some expectations. In my opinion, a vast majority of the combat items available to you are 100% useless and never going to see the light of day.

There are some bugged parts of the game. Without getting too specific, one of the suits. Never got it when I should have gotten it.

The relationship points DO seem to matter story wise, but not in any way that's crazy. I'm not gonna lie, I looked up a guide on gifts/hangouts early on. Even with that knowledge, I still had like 5 people I wasn't maxed out with at the end of the game and that's with having done a LOT of general missions.

Story: Pretty decent the entire way through.......except the ending. It had my jaw drop at how amazingly BAD it is. In an effort to be like the MCU, there are post-credit scenes. First one is worse than the ending. The character models of some of the people in it didn't even load. So I was seeing books float and hearing the voices. The 2nd post-credit scene was actually decent. Something I'd expect from a post-credit.

They set themselves up for a 2nd game, but who knows if that's ever coming.

Also, I got the DLC. Deadpool CARRIED it.

Its deckbuilding is pretty accessible (coming from someone who doesn't play such games) and makes combat pretty distinct from previous Firaxis games. The Marvel characters are mostly well written (Magik especially) and I enjoyed that to get to know them you have to actually think about their personalities rather than just straight mashing the Light or Dark morality responses every time. Those were enough to carry me through to the end of the game.

That being said, the game has a lot of little technical bugs that have not been fixed even over a year after launch. Nothing gamebreaking, but its clear that the game hasn't been given the TLC it needs (and it doesn't look like an expansion will come out to fix them and polish up the game). The overarching story is predictable and nothing worth writing home about (the character writing is where the focus went), and it feels borderline fanfic-y that your character becomes super best friends with all the heroes and kicks lots of butt. The game has the same inverse difficulty curve as previous Firaxis games, the beginning is difficult as your characters will start out weak and basic before levelling them up unlocks more abilities and fleshes out their kits.

Overall, I would wait for a good sale and pick it up (like I did).

X-COM with cards, and superheroes.

Marvel’s Midnight Suns sounded like it was just going to be yet another typical Marvel game, but all of that changed when Firaxis was named as the developer.  This is the company that produces the excellent X-COM games and if you immediately think it’s X-COM and Marvel… yeah it is.  For the good and bad.  

The good thing is that these heroes look like the comic book version of the characters and tend to talk like it too.  There’s good voice acting, and a high stakes story right from the beginning.  Combat is a tactical game combined with cards for actions.  Players control three characters and can move each as individuals, but there’s a lot of depth about where to move characters, and which attacks to use. 

On the other hand, the bad is there is a player self-insert that doesn’t fit the world called “the Hunter”. He or she just looks out of place.  The card combat and the tactical X-COM style will not appeal to everyone.  Also, the combat is great, and the story is good, but the side character and romance stuff are rough.   Oh, and there is a DLC and a season pass, which does have four more characters. I previously owned this game but I don’t think any of that is given away for free here. 

Pick this up if you like X-COM and want to play that with superheroes.  This also can work if you're a fan of card games but want something much more tactical, but overall I find this to be a pretty surprisingly good game.  But that is because this feels like a game hand-created for someone like me.   Still, I enjoyed myself and I’m glad more people will get a chance to check this out.

The core of the game is sending three superheroes, all with different sets of cards which represent their moves and abilities, into a fight against different factions of enemies and completing an objective, such as defeat all enemies or secure a device. You can only play so many cards per turn and certain cards cost ""heroism"" to use, so you have to balance smaller attacks with big heroic punches and laser beams. The fights are really engaging and its a lot of fun to experiment with all the different heroes and how their abilities synergize.

Between the fights, you return to your home base and socialize with the other heroes, doing requests and activities with them to build up your relationships. This unlocks additional bonuses in fights but for me this was also one of the driving forces to progress in the game besides unlocking cards and new heroes. The overall story is fine, I bet it's a lot more fun if you have more familiarity with Marvel and these characters, but regardless of how much you know Marvel, the characters are all really great, well-performed, and fun to interact with. Some of my favorite characters weren't necessarily the ones with the best abilities, but the ones who had the most interesting backstories or the best dialogue and quips.

I'd definitely recommend checking out Marvel's Midnight Suns, especially if you're a fan of strategy games in the vein of XCOM or really any card-based strategy game. My one piece of advice would be don't spend too much time on side missions before advancing the story. I did that early on because I wanted to unlock a lot of cards but I found it makes things drag and you're better off advancing the story to unlock more stuff than spending all your time with the beginning stuff. Okay that's it. Have fun!",1704460219,1704460219,True,3,0,0.528214752674102783,0,True,False,False

[H1]So what's it about?[/H1]
In Marvel's Midnight Suns, you build a team of seasoned Super Heroes from across the Marvel Universe to combat Lilith, Mother of Demons. There are three parts to the game: in the morning you train, select a mission and then do the tactical combat. When you return it’s time to hangout and discover the areas around the abbey. In between you build your card deck and abilities so you can then handle more challenging missions with better rewards.

[H1]The good[/H1]
[list]
[*]The combat effects are done exceptionally well, especially the dual attacks.
[*]Each character feels unique: compare having Spiderman unlocking a terminal (carefully hacking) versus Venom (smashing the keyboard).
[*]The story outside the friendship simulator part is good for a Marvel hero game. 
[*]The music and sound effects are done really well.
[*]All the text is voice acted and the voice acting is actually quite good for nearly all characters and 80% of the time
[*]One of your friends is a doggy :-)
[*]You can customise the heroes and your room with various outfits and items.
[*]You can also upgrade the cards into more powerful versions and customise them further to make your heroes even stronger.
[*]The environments are partly destructible. 
[*]I like the auto-complete function of the deck - you can put your favourite cards in the deck and then the game will add the best cards to complement.
[/list]

[H1]The not so good[/H1]
I bought the game on Steam: why is the awful 2K Launcher still required that reduces performance? 

Take the following steps to get rid off it:
[code]
Step 1: Start by right-clicking Marvel's Midnight Suns in your Steam library, selecting 'Properties', then the 'Local files' tab. Click 'Browse'.

Step 2: In the Explorer window that appears, open up the 'MidnightSuns' folder, then the 'Binaries' folder, then finally the 'Win64' folder. You’ll see an .exe file named 'MidnightSuns-Win64-Shipping' – hold Shift, right-click on this file, and click 'Copy as path'.

Step 3: Go back to the Steam Properties window and click the 'General' tab. Paste the path to that .exe into the Launch Options field; it should along the lines of ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Marvel's Midnight Suns\MidnightSuns\Binaries\Win64\MidnightSuns-Win64-Shipping.exe"", including the quote marks.

Step 4: To the end of this path text, add a space, then ""%command%"" (not including the quote marks). Then simply close the Properties window, and the next time you launch Marvel’s Midnight Suns, it should do so straight from this executable, skipping the 2K Launcher.
[/code]

[list]
[*]The friendship simulator story feels like a fan fiction soap opera. Earth is about to get destroyed yet the heroes are more concerned about book clubs, birthday parties and what the other team members think of them. Thankfully you can skip this dialogue and most cut scenes. 
[*]There are too many currencies affecting all the upgrades. It makes it feel like you are artificially locked into making progress and doing mundane tasks. 
[*]If you are looking to max out all your skills, levels, cosmetics and friendship stats for all heroes then be ready for a massive grind with artificial barriers.
[*]The cards are a good concept but combat is simplified compared to X-Com. 
[*]The pre-rendered cutscenes have dated physics and character animations with heavy compression and depth-of-field issues.
[*]There is not much enemy variety. The only variation are the bosses that sometimes show up. 
[*]In the later missions the rules suddenly change for that mission like the super villains have unlimited lives or you only have two turns to make it harder? 
[*]Also some of the mission objectives in the friendship simulator can't be fulfilled unless the games feels like it.
[*]It's a pity that some of the heroes are only unlocked late to very late in the game. 
[*]The rain effects are not great at all.
[*][SPOILER]The portrait photo of the Hulk is so cheesy :-(. There are also no other outfits available for Bruce. He is also the only hero where you cannot build up any friendship with - it feels like the developers ran out of time and just dropped him in within further consideration. [/SPOILER]
[/list]

[H1]Bugs and glitches[/H1]
There are numerous bugs and glitches varying from your mission objective disappearing or one unique armour not being available, crashes and items that glitch through the world. It’s nothing too game breaking, but I expect a much higher standard from Firaxis. 

[H1]The DLCs[/H1]
The DLCs add cosmetics to the game, stories and heroes. I enjoyed the latter and they are worth a buy (if they are not included already) when on sale. 

[H1]Summary[/H1]
Marvel's Midnight Suns shines in tactical combat, character effects and the general story, but bugs, glitches and the friendship simulator are not great. It’s a pity as there is a good game present just the negative distracts a bit. 

[H1]Should you buy it?[/H1]

Marvel's Midnight Suns is an absolute triumph in the realm of superhero gaming, delivering an unparalleled experience that seamlessly blends intense action, captivating storytelling, and breathtaking visuals. From the moment you dive into the game, you're immersed in a world where iconic Marvel characters come to life in ways you've never seen before.

The gameplay is nothing short of spectacular, with Midnight Suns introducing a unique and strategic card-based combat system that adds a refreshing layer of depth to the traditional superhero genre. This innovative approach keeps players on the edge of their seats, requiring both skillful tactics and a deep understanding of each hero's abilities. The result is a dynamic and engaging combat system that feels both familiar to long-time Marvel fans and invigoratingly new.

The narrative is another standout feature, weaving a rich tapestry of storytelling that explores the personal struggles and triumphs of our favorite superheroes. The character development is top-notch, providing players with a genuine connection to the heroes as they face the darkness that looms over them. The inclusion of a customizable protagonist adds a personal touch to the narrative, making the player feel like an integral part of the Marvel universe.

Graphically, Midnight Suns is a visual masterpiece. The attention to detail in character designs, environments, and special effects is awe-inspiring. Each hero's powers are brought to life with stunning visual effects that capture the essence of their comic book counterparts.

In conclusion, Marvel's Midnight Suns is a must-play for any Marvel enthusiast or gaming aficionado. It successfully raises the bar for superhero games, offering an immersive experience that combines innovation, storytelling, and breathtaking visuals.

The developer is known for XCOM games and while the general philosophy is somewhat similar it's better to forget about XCOM. Minute to minute it's more reminiscent of Slay the Spire. You go into combat with (usually) 3 heroes, each has a small deck, and you get these cards dealt into a common hand. You use character abilities using various resources, you use the environment, you can usually see enemy intentions - it's a deckbuilding roguelike all right. It also has a home base with lots of activities with superhero characters. A lot of cutscenes and interactions. And on top of it around the home base, there's a pocket-sized Metroidvania for some reason where you can get some resources for the main dish.

What I dislike a lot about this game is the free2play feel. There are dozens of resource pools. You get most of the improvements out of loot boxes. You break down cards and fuse them to improve them. You craft stuff. It doesn't ask me to buy loot boxes with real money, but it feels like it will do so any minute. It's all so tiresome, you get constant incremental upgrades for doing anything at all, and it never feels substantial. Battles themselves can be fun, but they quickly become repetitive. You can use various characters, you have different goals in different fights, but you always fight the same set of incredibly boring Hydra soldiers. Sometimes someone else comes and livens up the fight but it's not enough.

That's not the biggest issue. The biggest issue for me was that the story is not optional. At first, I thought all the Marvel tiresome wisecracking would end after introductory missions. No. The story piles up. It's similar to Fire Emblem Three Houses or Persona games. Your heroes go to a walk, organize clubs, talk to each other and your main character. It's non-stop, it doesn't pity you. It repeats the same jokes dozens of times in small variations, and even worse, the characters wise-crack the same phrases all the time. Tony Stark opens your lootboxes and he has like 3 different jokes for this process, and after several hours of the game, you will be able to make a perfect impression of all 3 Tony Stark jokes. If you try to play a puzzle training battle with, say, Blade, you will have to use him to fight dozens of characters alone, and after each kill, he will tell you your mother's joke. The game has an option for reducing the amount of combat phrases, but it will not save you from out-of-combat conversations and it also doesn't work at all. I'd think I just have no sense of humor but I've just recently played Shadows over Loathing, a game that also constantly tried to be funny and way much more effective at it, and I loved it. And it's not even Marvel hate from my side - I found Guardians of the Galaxy to be a fine game.

I couldn't stomach this game. The fights themselves are decent and they look novel and entertaining for a while, but not for long.",1704197795,1704197795,False,29,5,0.556075513362884521,0,True,False,False

[h1]I only recommending this game if: 
1. You enjoys this type of combat.
2. Big sale.
If you're not into turn-based tactics games or cards games, ignore this one, you won't miss anything. It's not XCOM but Marvel.[/h1]

The combat is good, it's a mix of card game and turn-based tactics. You control 3 heroes, each with 8 cards, you have 3 cards to play every turn, cards are not discard from your hard after every turn, 2 redraw  and 1 move per turn, you can spend your move point to push an enemy one time every turn, if they hit something both will take damage, there are environmental objects you can interact with to deal damage, they cost no card play and use heroism instead, some cards give heroism when played and some uses heroism. There are single target cards, buff/debuff cards, AoE cards, damage in a straight line cards, it's fun trying to make a build once you unlocked all cards and the ability to put mod on cards.

While I did finished the game, I did not enjoy half of it, the only good part is the combat, literally, even the musics are generic AF.
[list]

[*]The gameplay loop is like this, you start a the day in morning, there are certain things can only be done in the morning, then you start a mission, finished it and come back at night, then you need to socialize with other characters to gain friendship points, exploring the open world which is just one map with some metroidvania aspects, you go to sleep. The problem is the story and writing is dog water, it's mind numbing bad, basically a highschool drama but with superheroes or CW's The Flash after season 3, usually I don't care much about story but my god this one is insufferable, I've seen indie JRPG with better writing than this game and literally half of the game is socializing.

[*]Not only that some of the game designs feel like this was suppose to be a mobile cards game, many things you can only do once per day, you unlock cards by opening loot boxes, you gain materials by opening loot boxes, most of the UI are huge and make no sense for a non-mobile game, dialogue options are useless and does not affect the game at all so why even bother? there are like 20 different materials it's like a fkn MMO and they are all useless, the only thing that matters are credits and essences to mod your cards and oh boy, modding cards is a whole other problem. There's so much grind involve as if this was supposed to be a live services, you gain so little credits and essences per mission like less than 250 per mission for the majority of the game and modding cards can cost thousands to get the right mods unless you save scumming and learn what cards seed is which is a really annoying thing to do hundred of times. 

[*]The open world/map is so lifeless and pointless, so many useless, uninteresting collectables, open world powers that unlock depend on your story progress like a metroidvania, you walk around and unlocking respawnable chests to unlock color pallets and that's it. It could have been cut and it wouldn't affect the gameplay at all.

[*]Don't expect Slay The Spire or Monsters Train in term of card synergies, half of the heroes are downright bad without the right mods for their cards and with mods, most cards feel the same because they all use the same best in slot mods, the animations maybe different but the functions are the same, KO an enemy to get card play refund, gain +2 heroism, AoE attack that apply debuff. Legendary cards are a joke, half of them are just damage card like every other damage cards, no unique buff or anything.

[*]Difficulties are a joke, I change difficulty every time I unlocked a new one and it doesn't seem to change anything, even on the hardest difficulty the game is a joke.

[*]There are like 8 bosses in total and their fights are the same, down them 2-3 time and you're done, each boss has a gimmick that don't even worth mentioning. Same thing could be said about level designs, they are all the same, flat and small with no environmental obstructions.

[*]There are many enemy factions in the game but ultimately they acts the same way, fodder enemies that can be killed just by breathing at them, a shield guy that will protect the mission's target, an enemy that cast debuff on your heroes.

With a fairly deep roster, there are obviously more optimal choices to make, but I found that you can make any characters work if you devote time to them. I wish the story would continue on a bit further than it does, but the fun XCOM like strategy is married well to interpersonal stories and overarching themes that I think were executed very well. The voice acting is also superb, and helps you to become invested in the story and the characters, even when some of the actual dialogue is a bit strange.
I would have liked to see a bit more dynamic combat/mission options, which is my one true gripe about the game. After a while it does start getting a bit repetitive, and running around the social area gets pretty stale eventually. I think it would have been neat if the social space evolved a bit more visually than it does, since the 'upgrades' you can make only alter the Abbey very slightly.
Overall, definitely would recommend and would love a sequel, though I'm not sure that will ever happen.

I won't go into a bunch of detail about the game play..... you can watch Youtube or something for that.  I'll just say that it is a well made game from a AAA studio that features a good balance between deck-building, turn-based combat and third person ""team building"" that I found very unusual and interesting. Between missions of serious butt kicking action, you will spend your time building relationships with your team by joining a book club, planning surprise parties, playing video games and generally just chilling with your buds while discussing your messed up childhoods. That part of the game will not be for everyone, but I enjoyed it as something a little different from the norm. The game also does a good job of keeping all of the ""heroes"" involved in the story and missions so that none of them get completely lost in the shuffle. The main negative in my opinion is a limited amount of re-playability. There are only a few general side mission types in addition to the main story missions, and as good as they are, they do become repetitive after you master the best strategy to complete each type of mission.

This is a very good and very simple 'puzzle combat' tactical game.... under layers of mobile and AAA-chasing dreck. The actual missions are quick and enjoyable, and the story is a fun and slightly lighter take on the Midnight Sons/Suns comic runs. The new hero/heroine fits right in in the spooky side of the Marvel universe, depending on how willing you are to retcon the villain Lilith.

Sadly it's got frustrating time gating, tedious materials collection, and a rather pointless open world aspect that all feel like remnants of some other game. I'm probably glad it's not that game -- the open world portion has chests that drop randomized cosmetics and power-ups that were likely designed to have lootbox cash shop keys rather than the in-game key system we actually got -- but it's still mostly worse for their inclusion given the fairly simple lightweight nature of the underlying tactical game. The net feel is of a mobile game trying to parrot triple-A trends at the minimum possible depth.

A tighter focus probably could have released this as an uncritically delightful double-A title for less development cost and at half the initial price... which is about where I'd recommend buying it.

Given the open-world and collection elements a part of me wishes they'd made this as an attempt at an iso-hack-and-slash, a solo revival of Marvel Heroes. All that tedious real-time travel would make a lot more sense in that kind of game, and there's definitely a contingent of us who miss the brawler superhero genre.

You get to have 13 different Heroes (Plus a dog name Charlie that can be summon by the Hunter) along with 4 other in DLC with there own different abilities. Though some abilities are the same as each other, but not too samey.
While getting more cards from Gamma Coil, once legends rarity hit and you start getting the same cards, it becomes pointless to get new cards, especially Hunter have a whole lot compare to the other heroes.


While I love the main combat part of the game, all the Abbey stuff is a huge bloat that gets in the way and it's completely annoying with the cycle. It's funny how with all the screenshot and video on the Store Page, no screenshot but only 1 video at the very end show off all that bloat the game have.
If that bloat wasn't there, we might have gotten a whole lot more content from the main part of the game, such as instead of the friendship thing, we got Side-Story Mission for each of the characters with new enemies and mission types. But no we gotta have this sim crap.

As seen with the Eclipse Credit, the game have a shouldn't be here in a single-player game marketplace, if you get the season-pass the marketplace become a useless bloat as the pass gives you all of the skins.

Exploring the Abbey is fun, as it is a little open world with collectables to find and lore to uncover. The relationship building aspect can be a little tedious- but can often provide interesting insight into the minds of the heroes around the Abbey. The worst part of the game is that sometimes the relationship-sim part has the heroes worshipping the Hunter (the new hero you play as), and it is very out of character for them. These relationship conversations typically aren't important to the plot but can help build combat abilities so don't feel like you have to sit through it, I recommend skipping through most of these conversations.

- TONS of writing that shows understanding and care for the huge cast of Marvel heavy hitters to some more obscure heroes. This is all brought to life by what surprised me as one of the best voice casts in any game, especially one with so many characters. It's wild how enjoyable it is to spend what feels like a good half the play time just talking to everyone and soaking up all of the good writing from fun to emotional moments. 

- (Mostly) short and snappy missions that never get old due to the card system and heavily scale-able difficulty. Having a large cast of characters to swap in and out to find different synergies made me not want to finish the campaign and just keep running side missions because I didn't want it to end. The animations and visuals are great and really make you feel the power of the heroes while also constantly putting you on the edge of peril where it's exhilarating to narrowly pull out a win.

- A rewarding progression system that introduces itself at a solid pace to build your familiarity with the game systems so that the strategy portion of deckbuilding and how to spend your time and resources never feels old.  Another surprising part was the open world exploration of the Abbey grounds.  It's actually quite a large area that opens up slowly and the mystery baked into finding all the secrets is really fun to slowly go through in downtime between missions.

Only cons would be some performance issues I had on the final mission causing game crashes, but thankfully there are autosaves every turn.  Also, some of the general missions types are much harder than others, especially if you don't have a proper team comp.  On higher difficulties this can lead to some frustrations because even later in the game, there are only a few heroes that can fill tank and support roles, so you'll find yourself using them a lot more than others.

The DLC characters are great, and I highly recommend unlocking each one as soon as you can, as they unlock some super helpful upgrades when you finish their research,. However, some of the DLC missions have CRAZY difficulty spikes and the DLC story starts to wear a little thin as it goes on. The DLC vampire enemies are also the most frustrating ones to fight in the game to the point where it's just not fun after you've dealt with them enough.

Overall, this game will sink it's teeth into you and you will love it if you are into any of the following things: XCOM games, Marvel comics (especially the more occult characters/x-men/Avengers), Persona games, deckbuilding games, good writing/voice acting, RPG progression.",1703927469,1703927469,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- All battles run at 40fps on medium-high settings. Performance is much better in-game than I was led to believe (though there have been performance patches since launch explicitly for steam deck)

-Moving around in the hub world between battles is a pretty stuttery experience at sub-30 fps in many spots. It sucks, but it doesn't really impact the gameplay.

Game:
This game is fun as hell! It's not an X-COM derivative, it's more like Into The Breach: your goal in every round is to figure out how to maximize the number of actions your heroes execute, which ends up being more of a puzzle than it first appears. 

You can only play 3 Cards per round, but many Cards will refund a play if you KO an enemy with them. By picking the right enemies, you can play more cards. 

There are also Move abilities which don't require cards (so they aren't limited by the 3-cards-per-round) to do things like throw an enemy into an environmental hazard. 

Card plays will reposition your hero, so playing a Card might leave you in a great spot to execute a Move. Lots of synergy between the heroes as well. 

The combat outshines everything else this game has to offer which is a relief: a lot of the dialogue is rough around the edges and the first ~3 hours of the game has a lot of the worst, cringiest dialogue in the whole ~35hr main quest. It's mostly skippable or easily fast forwarded with subtitles. The actual plot of the game is fine though, with 'saturday morning cartoon' vibes.

A lot of people may feel disgusted upon seeing it's partly card game and yes, cards are huge part of the game and sometimes bad luck can be quite discouraging. But drawing bad card can be somewhat like missing 80% shot in X-Com. It happens, it sucks, but can be played around. And boy sometimes it's fun to solve some situations in combat phase. It's more tactics game than card game. You must take in consideration every aspect of battlefield like position of your heroes, position of enemies and types of enemies, obstacles on the battlefield, abilities you have in hand (cards) and which you could draw... It's hard to explain without showing, but it is not ""another card game"" like some people say.

+ Pretty enjoyable combat - whole tactical part of the game is almost superb.
+ Characters - pretty good writing, nice dub, great lore material and nice references, pretty nice selection of heroes too
+ Story - Almost every aspect of main story was quite enjoyable with some twists and great character interactions but had some hiccups in the end

~ Roaming - I have mixed feelings about this part of game. All ok until you realize there is some ""exploration"" part of the game, solving some little riddles and collecting stuff evidently only for extending playtime.
~ Amount of lore - While I was enjoying a lot of dialogue with the other characters, it got pretty tedious at the end of the game. The amount of their problems and backstories which are constantly presented to you is overwhelming and I found myslef not really paying attention towards the end.
~ DLC - DLCs are great, Deadpool is best of them and it contains nice story line and missions. But although I enjoyed new characters, they are not integrated to the main story very well, if you know, they are DLC characters, you will notice it. Like standing together further away from others etc... I know, it's mostly technical limitations and main story was done before DLC's but it's too obvious and you see these characters somewhat different.

- End of story - Not a fan of ending. Won't spoil, but not satisfied. Too clichés.
- Optimalisation - Oh boy, I had some hiccups while playing. Sometimes lagging action resolving (players of X-Com 2 would know), some frame drops, one or two crashes but was not that bad. Still it could be better.
- Move / Push - Where can I start? It cannot be only me who had this issue. Every turn you can move character or use that move to push enemy (into another enemy, into some hazard obstacle, of the cliff...). If you want to push enemy, you must engage ""movement"" and after that select an enemy. I had dozens of situations where I accidentaly moved character instead of pushing an enemy. I know, my bad, but this is so easily ""misclicked"" I must mention it.

Battle and Gameplay
quite surprised at the beginning because it uses a deck-building card system, but after learning it, it's actually addictive. Each superhero can carry 8 cards, and each team consists of 3 heroes, for a total of 17 heroes (4 from DLC). Overwhelming? At the end of the story, yes.
My advice is to just enjoy playing it; you don't need to push story missions, grind and upgrade decks for each hero, try each hero, and don't be too quick to conclude which hero is your favorite because you will be surprised that all heroes are fun.

Animation and Cutscene
Battle animation heroes and hero actions in cutscenes are quite satisfying to the eye and add enthusiasm to continue playing this game.

General Mission (Side Mission)
Using auto-generated missions so that side missions will appear endlessly, similar to X-COM but X-COM we are pressed for time, can't keep grinding, now in this game there is no such problem, want to do side missions? no problem. If you have finished the story, you can continue playing too because there is a new game plus.

The best way to sum Marvel Midnight Suns is that it is a mashup between the new X-COMs (also from Firaxis) and a trade card game (there are plentitude of those nowadays). One can see the influence of X-COM on Marvel Midnight Suns, from the animations to the strategic yet fun turn-based game (although here the abilities are cards on their own). The base building on X-COM is replaced here with a more story based approach where one interact constantly with the other heroes, access their reactions and chose dialog accordingly. There is also the exploration of the map surrounding the building (or base) where everything happens. The exploration part is basically optional and it is not required in order to play and finish the game but it’s a nice option for those that like collecting items and having more information around the lore of the game.
Probably the most controversial part of the game is all the dialog and interactions with the other heroes which takes a considerable amount of time between missions. I don’t mind this part at all, I think it’s very well done even if the dialog can be a bit cheesy at times, but hey, we are playing what is essentially an interactive comic book and Marvel comics are not known for their profound writing anyway. I do admit that I kind of speed skip those sometimes when I just want to play the missions.
The production of the game is very high level, from the fully voiced interactions, the story, the animations, sound effects and graphics.
It’s a pity that the game wasn’t a commercial success, probably because everyone was waiting for X-COM 3. Probably there won’t be a Marvel Midnight Suns 2 but at least I can safely say after 80 hours of this game (I guess close to finishing it) that what we get in this one, although not perfect, it’s an amazing game for anyone that likes turned based combat and has any slight interested in the Marvel universe. 
If I had to give it a rating, this is a very solid 8/10 game.

The spaghetti they were throwing at the wall was very sticky that day and everything made it into the pot. 

All that said, its a very fun game and it runs fairly easily on my low to mid grade laptop.

Sometimes there is too much cut-scene dialogue, story shoveling but you can skip it easily and its not necessary, as the NPCs tell you frequently.

Yes, but only if on sale. 

Now for the long answer. At least for me, MMS has absolutely zero replay value. The missions are tedious. Hero abilities take forever to cast, and everything seems unnecessarily grindy and slow. While combat can be fun when you land the exact combo you want, it's just very slow and drags along painfully at times. It seems like there should be a 2x speed button or some kind of setting to skip some of the ability animations, considering how long some of them take to complete. And there is a lot of leveling tedium as well, wandering from one place to another simply to upgrade a card you should be able to upgrade from your inventory. And some other tedious busywork that feels totally unnecessary unless you're playing on higher difficulties. 

Now for the good. The characters and story are fantastic, and don't let anyone tell you differently. While the story may seem like a basic ""good vs. evil"" schtick, it's actually a bit more complicated than that and will give you a great new character in the form of the Hunter. I absolutely loved the way the character ended up developing, and without spoiling anything, the relationships you build over the course of the story really are the greatest reward of the game, particularly with the characters who haven't had any real exposure previously on screen. I even got a little emotional a few times, which is rare with this type of game. The combat, as I said, is pretty fun. There's some nice exploration around the grounds. And there is a lot of comic-based character backstory as well, plus plenty of cosmetics to play around with. 

I think it's safe to say the base game is worth the money, at least at a discount, but possibly even full price if you're into the comics and you enjoy turn-based combat or card battlers. 

Now the DLC: I didn't care for it personally. I could have saved my money on it. Admittedly, Storm was amazing. But Morbius and Deadpool ended up being some of the least-used, and their stories were extremely short and not particularly compelling. The whole vampire schtick felt out of place somehow as well, perhaps because you're already focusing on a world-ending threat and it just adds more confusion into the mix. 

All in all, base game is a yes; easily can sink 50 hours or more in, even without doing all of the extras. DLC is a no unless you like a few extra missions and a little bit of vampire-related story that doesn't really go anywhere. And that's from a thoroughly satisfied customer who would recommend this game a dozen times over.",1703656608,1703656924,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Marvel's Midnight Suns is a highly anticipated addition to the Marvel gaming universe, bringing together beloved superheroes and an innovative strategy-based gameplay experience. Developed by Firaxis Games, known for their work on the XCOM series, the game promised a fresh take on the superhero genre, and it certainly delivered.

The storyline is a captivating blend of dark mysticism and the familiar Marvel narrative, introducing players to an original plot where Earth is under threat from supernatural forces. The player assumes the role of the Hunter, a customizable character, who collaborates with iconic Marvel heroes to save the world.

One of the standout features of Midnight Suns is its tactical, turn-based combat system. Drawing inspiration from XCOM, the gameplay combines strategic decision-making with the awe-inspiring abilities of superheroes. Each hero boasts a unique set of skills, and players must carefully plan their moves to unleash devastating combos and overcome formidable adversaries. The synergy between characters and the depth of the tactical gameplay make every battle a thrilling experience.

Graphically, Midnight Suns impresses with its stunning, comic book-inspired visuals. The characters are beautifully rendered, staying true to their comic counterparts while incorporating a modern flair. The environments are rich in detail, from mystical realms to the familiar streets of Marvel's iconic locations.

The game also stands out in terms of character development and narrative. The interactions between the Hunter and Marvel's legendary heroes add depth to the story, and the decision-making aspects contribute to a sense of player agency. The emotional resonance of the narrative is heightened by an excellent voice cast that brings the characters to life.

However, Midnight Suns is not without its minor flaws. Some players may find the learning curve steep initially, especially if they are not familiar with tactical RPGs. Additionally, while the customization options for the Hunter are extensive, some players might crave more depth in terms of character customization for the established Marvel heroes.

In conclusion, Marvel's Midnight Suns is a triumph for both Marvel enthusiasts and strategy game aficionados. Its engaging narrative, strategic depth, and faithful representation of beloved characters make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Firaxis Games has successfully brought the Marvel universe to the tactical RPG realm, creating an experience that is as thrilling as it is visually stunning.",1703649416,1703649416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]TL;DR:[/b] I stopped enjoying it because of the underpolished characters with wich you spend a significant game time interacting with, and the unnatural third-person navigation mechanic of the base which also takes a significant time (ie. ~75% doing this two, the rest are cutscenes and the actual gameplay)

The main gameplay (the one with the cards and turnbased tactics) is solid and fun, however, something had to glue together all the missions and that's where things gone south.

75% of my time has gone into ""Talos Princeple""-ing the abbey and its grounds (this third person manuverable base), plus playing ""Mass Effect""-ish superhero socializing simulator, both of which are really underdeveloped.

The problem with the latter is that looking at the models' faces and body ""movements"" is just eerie breaks the immersion and feels cheap, and it's not just clicking through lets get over with it. The answers matter because of this friendship mechanic with the heroes. You can also lose not just win points engaging in these conversations (many of which are mandatory).

The former: it's huge and poorly designed. No artifacts to help you better navigating it, and no jumping/climbing on vertical terrain (ie. you cannot bypass a ledge on a mound), plus (this is the point where I write my review) this has also mandatory missions involved.

Maybe these things won't bother you, and can look all over the models and don't get lost navigating in third person, but for me it's just more salt than I'm used to,

Gameplay was fine, but wasn't what I was expecting. Guess I could have watched some videos, but its not as X-comy as I was lead to believe. Sure its turn based strategy, but tactical rpg, I don't think so. Positioning isn't as much of a focus. Your attacks are what ever the cards you are given, which admittingly have pretty cool animations., but the levels are just a square battlefield with backgrounds that look like the level has depth but are blocked by invisible walls. 

Then the inbetween hub area feels like a completely different game, with dialogue written like parody versions of a cartoon version of these characters written by Joss Whedon when he was 12. Dialogue is like: Iron man swoops in 'quippy one liner', Dr Strange 'indubitably, Iron man, it seems the magical BS is strong in this region' strong female character 'whose the dork?' Iron man 'that's dr spooky don't mind him, he does that'. All its missing is a sitcom laugh track. 

Honestly, I have more fun modding X-com 2 into adding Marvel like characters. The perma death in that game and making the characters  like comic book characters adds a sense of loss when they die. I strong recommend X-com 2.

But still, somehow manages to be one of the best Marvel games around, featuring the most fun card-based combat systems I've ever toyed around with. Not only that, but Midnight Suns tells a heartfelt, well-written story that brings out the best of it's vibrant roster. Those of you familiar with these heroes from comic book pages will be pleasently surprised, as some of them are way better written than anything the House of M has done recently, but I digress.

So, here's the gist of it: if you don't try hard and just enjoy the ride, without attempting to complete everything on your first run, this game is an absolute blast. Sure, you will hit a few bumps along the road, but the sights will be worth it. The core loop is almost addicting, while managing to offer plenty of lore for you to sink your teeth into. Not only that, but some of the plot elements are real heavy hitters, highlighting the human side of our favorite legends. 

Also, there's a dog and you can pet it and yes, it's a mechanic. 

There's no hiding the truth: even though this game offers tens of hours of content, it still feels unfinished at times. It's obvious that the scope of the project was planned to be way bigger than the existing product, with a sequel after-credits teaser to boot. Sadly, the outlook of that happening isn't that good as of today. But I hope I'm wrong. I hope that we do get that sequel some day. 

Because I'm 100% convinced that Moon Knight was planned to be a part of this game and there isn't a single force in the universe, capable of convincing me otherwise. But I'll have to wait out until we get a sequel in order to see my fav hero enjoy the fun stuff, donning gold. 

So, TL;DR, here we go: 

Midnight Suns is the best Marvel game since Ultimate Alliance 3 and one of the best tactical games of its year. And that's not ""nuff said"", but I emplore you to find out why yourself. Yes, it isn't perfect. But it deserves your attention and love. Mark my words: this will be a cult-classic a decade from now.",1703622195,1703622195,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game absolutely does not respect the players time.  Inane badly written conversations in the Abbey stand between you and every engagement.  And the the battles themselves waste a not insignificant
chunk of your life waiting on combat animations to finish.

And about all that dialogue they're so proud of, real people don't talk like this.  These characters interact with each other like people trying to imitate how humans they've watched do it.  This isn't so bad it's good, it's so bad it's very bad.

This is what a game designed by 4 or 5 teams all in separate locations that never talked to each other looks and plays like.  When they bolted Frankenstein's Monster together the parts didn't form a whole.

The core card battling mechanic is interesting and solidly done, but it just doesn't mesh well with the rest of the systems. I found it frustrating that you could only take three heroes on each mission, often 2 of those are selected for you, and you don't always have or know what cards you are going to need, forcing a restart and reload. It feels arbitrary and restrictive. Combo-ing up some good cards can feel pretty great, but you have to depend on luck to draw them. Too often you CANNOT do what you want because you don't have the plays or the draws. Environmental objects and interactions can be neat, but you can only move 1 hero per turn for some reason, again, feeling unnecessarily restrictive.. 

Despite it's weaknesses, if the combat was more prominent then I might give the game a pass, but SO much of Midnight Suns is inane and pointless chatter or running around the manor fining collectibles. You are fighting a world ending threat, but make sure you stop for 20 minutes between every fight to customize the drapes, pick some herbs, chat up yet another hero about something incredibly uninteresting and join the book club.  It feels like doing chores, because honestly, it is doing chores.

And the writing! Nothing prepared me for how bad the writing is. The dialogue is often super cringe and annoying, full if unfunny quips, stilted jokes and awkward exposition. It's sort of tied to the core combat through a ""friendship"" mechanic that just feels random and awful. Better pick the right response, say what the hero wants to hear, or you lose a point of friendship. Blegh. Many of these characters are beloved by many people, with complex histories and backstories, but the writing makes them seem like one-sided morons with the emotional intelligence of a 12 year old.

What I wasn't prepared for was how much this game would hijack my social life, with each mission feeling like a raucous dinner party with my favorite Marvel characters.

The gameplay? More addictive than Spider-Man’s web-swinging across New York. It's like chess, but with Iron Man and Doctor Strange as your knights and bishops, casting spells and launching repulsor blasts instead of the usual, boring chess moves.

The story? It's as if Marvel decided to throw a surprise party and invited every cool superhero they knew. From the brooding Wolverine to the always-charming Ghost Rider, every character brings their unique flavor to this narrative fiesta.

And let's talk about the graphics – they're so good, I'm pretty sure I saw Captain America's shield glinting in my living room. The level of detail is so high; I half-expected Doctor Strange to pop out of my screen and offer me a cup of tea.

But it's not just about the battles and visuals. The game offers a 'Friendship' feature that's like a superhero version of speed dating, except you're trying to make BFFs instead of finding a date for Saturday night.

Combat is mix of card game,tactical RPG with fluidly animated super hero moves, which depends of team of heroes you lead.
This game grew to me,I am pleasantly suprised,and I am almost 60 hours in and it seems there is plenty more to go.

Only thing I may have an issue with,that outside combat,while exploring the Abbey or just walking around,sometimes camera has been losing its focus or being too fast in changing angles.Nothing major.

If you are like me whenever I see card based gameplay in a video game I do tend to run the opposite direction. I'm really glad I did my research ahead of time. The cards keep the gameplay fresh for every encounter you face. 

I noticed its on sale for Christmas. You should pick it up if you are on the fence. It's so rad. DLCs are dope too because they add another side story as well as 4 classic marvel icons. Personal favs are Storm and Venom.

Do you like marvel? It's probably the best marvel game out there aside from Marvel Snap.

Do you like strategy games? It's a great turn based strategy that leads you to try different things with how you can draw cards that make it so you can't just rely on one specific character.

Story is solid it's a typical superhero story but the dating sim aspect of the game is pretty campy and enjoyable. Going fishing with Wolverine is something I never thought of doing haha.

I originally did not recommend this due to the massive amount of bugs, but now the game runs fine with only slight stuttering after cut scenes (which is probably just my fault and I need to adjust some settings). Having played 6 hours with it working as intended I can say it's fun, but not as awesome as I was hoping for 
""Marvel XCOM"". The card system feels limiting and makes me feel like my superheroes are less super than they should be, but I also understand it'd be really hard to balance Iron Man and Captain Marvel against regular goons if given no limits. I wish they just had abilities with cooldowns (stronger ability = bigger cooldown) but the devs decided differently. Still a fun game, recommend if you're a fan of Marvel, otherwise there's better turn-based strategy games you can play.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: 

I'll start with I LOVE Marvel and I LOVE strategy games like XCOM so I wanted to love this game. That said I do love the story and the casual interactions with the characters, but I continually had massive drops in framerate to point I was playing MS PowerPoint the Game and my characters facial textures would continually glitch out giving me rainbow void man. Didn't have anything gamebreaking, but all in all I recommend holding off for right now and checking back in maybe a few months to a year. By then these issues will hopefully be fixed. SOOO MUCH POTENTIAL THO! I'll definitely be revisiting this eventually and hopefully I'll have a better time.

(For those curious I'm running an AMD Ryzen 5 CPU and an RTX 2080 Super GPU so I had pretty decent hardware, at least decent enough to warrant not having problems like this.)",1674003176,1703135920,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

[b][u]Author Transparency/Risk for Bias[/u][/b]
Big fan of both Firaxis and strategy/tactics games, casual Marvel fan.

[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]
A fun and novel mix of deck-building and turn-based combat. Each hero has some unique traits and cards that allow for some satisfying plays when comboed correctly. Hero decks are a mixture of basic attacks, buffing or debuffing, and heroic abilities. Heroes and their decks are fairly balanced though a few heroes are a bit stronger overall (ex. Spiderman and Magik) while others are underwhelming at times (ex. Captain Marvel and Nico). Still no hero is useless and it can be fun to try out different team compositions & decks as you continually hone your strategies. New cards and combos are unlocked as you progress through the game which has you revising each hero’s deck. Cards can also be enhanced and altered to an extent to customize each hero’s deck further.

Missions alternate between story missions with cutscenes and standard missions that jump right into battle with a singular objective; the latter being the more grindy part of the game, but this can be kept to a minimum if you do not want to unlock all cosmetics. Non-story missions are varied enough that they do feel overly repetitive unless you have exhausted all story missions. The grid system found in most tactical strategy games is abandoned for a more open field allowing for more fluid positioning when making your plays. Difficulty can be easily adjusted if you are having trouble or if you want a greater challenge without having to start a new game. Additionally, each turn allows a movement and items as free actions as well as a number of redraws to even out bad luck with your hand for the turn.

Down-time between mission activities is a mix of resource management, exploration, research, and socializing with your team members to further your character’s relationship with them. This is a nice breath of fresh air at first but can become quite tedious at times and requires an above average amount of tutorials. Exploring the abbey and doing a host of side fetch quest feels largely like padding. The hero relationship & conversation pieces are very light and wholly plutonic so do not expect any romance scenes or Bioware-esque dialogue trees.

[b][u]Story/Characters[/u][/b]
Fairly engaging narrative despite the generic “big bad has returned to destroy/enslave the world” plot with some surprise twists. There is witty dialogue in both the game and from the characters that will likely make you chuckle. Characters all have some endearing traits though there are few times they can come off as annoying. Dramatic moments are appropriately spaced and add tension without overwhelming the plot. There is sometimes a bit of a mood whiplash though when the high stakes moments are proceeded by the routine downtime activities.
It should be noted that this game does not take place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

[b][u]Visuals[/u][/b]
The game hosts a variety of different environments for field missions which all have some unique flavor. Battle animations and effects are colorful and engaging. Character designs are a mixed bag with some interesting takes and some very dull ones, but you can purchase other options to suit your tastes and will likely find a look for each character you can enjoy.  

[b][u]Audio[/u][/b]
Remarkable soundtrack in most cases especially the battle themes, ‘A Night at the Carnival’ was my personal favorite. Voice acting and sound effects are well done overall with no glaring weaknesses.

[b][u]DLC[/u][/b]
A bit light on the content for what you get which is a new character and 3 two-part story missions for each DLC plus a final mission if you have all 4 DLC characters. Recommended if you get it discounted.

[b][u]Replay Value[/u][/b]
Fairly mild, most of the replay value comes from trying out a different voiced version of the player character, dialogue options, and deck strategy for your character assuming you did not try all the possible combinations in your first playthrough.

[b][u]Miscellaneous/Nitpicks[/u][/b]
Heroes that are just 3rd wheels to other characters’ plot missions all use generic battle posing (ex. Standing with fists clenched) during cutscenes instead of displaying their powers which is a bit jarring in some cases.

When you're not doing that, you're back at the Abbey hanging with the rest of the superhero crew, going on little ""get to know you"" outings, joining a book club, dealing with Tony's ego, performing rituals to bring back your memories, and supporting the next generation of heroes working in the shadow of the Avengers. It's a bit schlocky, but it's all good fun.

Missions are a small arena where you bring 3 of your heroes and the enemy brings an array of Hydra minions and the occasional supervillain of their own to oppose you. Your choice of actions each turn is controlled by the hand of cards you draw from a mixed deck that combines abilities from all three heroes. If you've played ""Across the Obelisk"" or ""SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech"" you'll have some familiarity with the mechanic that each hero is bringing a different array of powers into the fight. However, the tactical positioning, use of environmental objects, and just sheer fun of kicking the crap out of minions is an unreal execution of the basic premise that is hard to put into words. I love using throw abilities to pile up enemies in clusters so I can set off an explosive barrel in their midst or bury them under a load of cargo crates.

So what is there not to love? In short - the Abbey itself. There's a large area to move around the HQ and even the Abbey itself has a surprising amount of space in it for characters to hang out and mingle. Unfortunately, this makes the process of finding the person you want to talk to a bit tricky. Going from doing research to upgrading your heroes to planning the next mission takes more clicks and running around than I really wish it did. But honestly, the part that rubs me the wrong way is the grounds outside the Abbey that's littered with a bunch of quests and crafting ingredients. You'll find yourself going through tight, winding paths of trees in circles looking for mushrooms, flowers, and just random hot spots to click on to advance your quest. I just want to get back to the actual combat missions, please.",1703034305,1703034305,True,4,2,0.541734158992767334,0,True,False,False

1) There's something to like for a lot of different people and the game provides optionality for every facet of the game. If you love Marvel, want to make friends with every character, and have every conversation and lore dump, then you can do that. If you have no interest in that, then it's all largely skippable with 98% of the conversations being optional. If you enjoy card battlers and want to optimize every deck in the game, then the game provides numerous paths to do so with tons of characters to optimize. If not, you can keep the difficulty in an enjoyable sweet spot and keep the deck adjustments fairly basic to make missions more like puzzles to solve.

2) This game has the best difficulty system you'll find in a game. You start with Normal, then as you progress the game will offer you the option you to turn up the difficulty if it sees you're performing well in your missions. What do you get in exchange? Currency (gloss) that you can use to buy cosmetics for all your heroes! Again, it's a totally optional offer and can always be adjusted back down later on if you decide to do so. (I cranked the difficulty up into Ultimate before eventually pulling it back down into Heroic in order to make the game more puzzly and less grindy card-battler.)

3) The game has a ton of cool cosmetics in the base game if you're into that sort of thing. The DLC packs are certainly cool, but there's more than enough base content to unlock during one playthrough. I have the DLC outfits and enjoy using some of them, but the base game default and challenge suits are all pretty cool and I use them most of the time anyways.

Bonus thought: The DLC isn't critical to buy, but I did enjoy the dozen extra story missions. The added characters are fun as hell to use and provide a lot more variety on missions. (Venom is AWESOME.)",1702961488,1702961488,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's almost like they had three half finished games that they decided to merge into one. The game can't decide if it wants to be a turn based tactics game, a card game, or a superhero dating sim.

The writing is typical Marvel style schlock, full of dated pop culture references with no punchline and corny ""Awkward!"" style lines. Akin to jingling keys in a baby's face until it giggles.

The ""tactical"" combat is very shallow. It's card based, and takes place in exactly the same small flat, square arena with a few explosives and environmental hazards to knock enemies into, no matter what the fight. Positioning doesn't matter much, enemies telegraph their next attack and just run up and hit you, no cover, or elevation or anything like that.

In between fights you go to ""the abbey"", and play a bizarre almost Sims like dating game sequence where you run around and pick up collectibles, talk to various heroes, and play dress-up. I'd almost enjoy it if the writing wasn't so corny. But it seems weird to play monopoly with Wolverine and Dr. Strange while the Earth is in peril. 

None of the big story moments seem to have any effect on the characters. A few moments after his sanctum is destroyed, and Scarlet Witch is seemingly killed, Dr. Strange is cracking jokes and playing Monopoly with Tony Stark.

The game isn't horrible though, just don't expect any deep tactical fights or clever writing. I got it on sale, but still wouldn't recommend at $30.

The gameplay strikes a perfect balance between action-packed superhero battles and tactical decision-making, reminiscent of the XCOM series. The diverse roster of Marvel characters, each with unique abilities, adds a layer of strategy that kept me engaged throughout.

What sets Midnight Suns apart is its gripping storyline and character development. The narrative unfolds with cinematic flair, and the interactions between characters are both entertaining and emotionally resonant. It's a Marvel fan's dream come true.

With 2 base and 6 unlocked difficulty levels to start the player out easy then let the player unlock the choice of higher challenge as they clear missions and progress through the story, the game is great at giving players choices.
With a decent sized cast of heros and both RPG level/stat building as well as card/deck management for character progression, there's some pretty interesting forms of power progression and balance around that. The card based combat system that's kinda sorta a deck builder-lite with tactical character positioning brings interesting strategies, and every hero has their niche that can stand out, particularly in higher difficulties.

However on the negative side, nearly everything else about this game is an exercise in poor UX design, tedium, and mediocrity to the frustrating point of a death by a thousand cuts. The game is riddled with regularly repeated short cutscenes or transitions that linger overly long and take away player control on nearly every input from the player. The input for skipping cutscenes being holding a key/button for around a second makes even the skippable animations and cutscenes an annoyance with how frequent they are.

For example, at the end of every day after a mission when the player character ends the day by sleeping, there are 3 repeated cutscenes. Each has to be skipped separately and two of them are the exact same every time they play, with the third one being a random scenic shot on a rotation. This is in a campaign that will probably take 40-80 in game days. That ends up as a lot of time spent seeing the exact same thing over and over, and that's just one component of the game cycle that's on repeat, though one of the most noticeably egregious.
In combat, many cards trigger mini cutscenes that have no way to skip or shorten the animations. For some reason these tend to quickly shift away the camera to attempt to get an action shot, though not always successfully. Hero Combo cards are particularly bad in this between how little effort was put into them and how long they take to play out. Hero Combo cards will just swap back and forth a few times between the two heroes the card triggered for. They will play the same animation per hero no matter which heroes are involved, and never show both heroes at the same time for the duration of the ""combo"". There's not even some random variance in their attacks, seeing a hero combo with another, means one has seen them combo with every other hero.

Even the card management menu shows very little care when it's a core part of the game. Filtering and sorting never saves, there is one default of all cards and sort by newest that will be set every time any card management screen is entered.
Adding cards to every hero's 8 card ""deck"" is oddly not refined for how common an occurrence it should be as part of character progression. When one gets a new card they want to add, instead of being able to swap the card in, first a card has to be removed to open up a slot, which puts it as the newest acquired card. So then the desired new card becomes the 2nd newest card and has to be selected as such to now be added to the deck. The default sort being newest also makes it more difficult to identify duplicate cards. Extra duplicates is an easy to hit goal when the deck building restriction is only 2 of each card type.
Not to mention a few times I've had the menus bug out and go unresponsive on me.

There are a lot of different types of resources and items for various types of outside of combat progression that can be found. Probably over half of them are near useless and will end up doing nothing but clog up item menus. The great thing is the player's only allowed to salvage or delete a small subset of item types, so these can be a constant reminder of pointless decisions or wasted time/resources. Thankfully NG+ will wipe out all of these otherwise undroppable items if one even manages to get to that point.

Overall, while this game brings a number of interesting and good ideas to the table, it also manages to bring in a mountain of bad decisions that overshadow the good parts of the experience. Definitely not worth a full price buy, maybe on a deep sale. Also don't even consider getting the Digital+ Edition, it's just a bunch of overpriced skins.

Basically you upgrade your team by not only going on missions, but also by the relationships you build with them, which ties in with the story very well. The walking controls/mechanic outside of combat feels clunky as hell but you get used to it. The base building isn't as intensive as XCOM the headquarters and is more at your own pace. If you love Marvel, you'll love the story. Most team members are Marvel characters that have some sort of dark side like Blade, Scarlet Witch, Magik, and it's pretty bad ass. Also has some iconic Avengers in the roster. Can't wait for the sequel.

You are talking for about a minute or two, which for missions that last long is not a bad ratio. The conversations are interesting to know more of a character, and you could even just skip them if you dont like any reading/conversation at all

The game feels too simple at first, but it continuously introduces new mechanics that TURN it into a great turn based game. Upgrades, abilities, deck selection, hero roster, you really get to customize your style of play through different heroes.

I have not finished yet, but i think it at leas gives enough hours of entertaining play, its a twist on the XCOM formula because there is no random factor and no permanent death. That makes it a little bit less strategic (infinite attack range) but it is also more of a puzzle (play your cards right and win).

The RPG and downtime elements are more involved than I thought they would be, the latter of which might not be everyone's cup of tea.

And the actual combat is delicious. Scanning the battlefield looking for the best ways to combo minions into stronger enemies, use stage items for heroic action attacks, and all the other effects you get with the cards.

Outside of the combat you've got a Tomb Raider's mansion-y exploring thing going on with the Abbey, upgrading your cards and choosing research options to improve the Abbey, prepping for the next mission by crafting consumables, and of course talking to your team and getting involved with little storylines.

Why not? Well, take a look at the price. Then add on the DLC. £100 for a completely new franchise game is just too much for most people. Especially when Denuvo is involved, which puts a lot of people off on principle. People will often put up with being scammed by DLC prices when it is a series they know they like. It's a lot harder to commit to that sort of spend when it's a new franchise. Especially in the middle of a cost of living crisis. 

That said, I'd recommend you do what I did when weighing up whether or not to buy the game. Put it on your wishlist, and get it when it is on sale. I definitely think it is a fun game - flawed, granted, but a fun game.

MMS is far more an rpg than the strategy games you might expect from Firaxis and the rebooter of XCOM. That does show to an extent, as there are decisions developers more used to making rpgs wouldn't have made, and the story isn't as strong as you're probably used to in AAA rpgs. 

The battles are the most enjoyable part of the game, and what happens in-between tends to feel like busy work. The combat is card based, where the game combines the deck of each hero you bring to combat (deck = 8 cards), and you draw cards each turn from that to fill up your hand (to 6). From there you choose 3 actions per turn to take out the opponent. Some cards might refund an action if you kill an opponent, or allow you to draw more cards, others might heal your heroes, or give them stat boosts, say. It's not a cakewalk to win the battle, particularly on the harder difficulties (which unlock as you progress through the game so long as you win decisively enough), and it can be quite fun working out the best combo you can make from what is in your hand at any given time.

On the flip side, some types of card are simply more useful than others. 'Quick' cards (which refund an action if you kill an enemy) are essential, and cards which also allow you to draw more cards equally so. On the other hand, some of the stat boosting cards feel more like luxuries, as you need to ensure you have pest control sorted for the weaker enemies first and foremost. Then there are some cards, which are meant to be incredibly strong, that felt to me more like hindrances - cards which allow you to summon an extra ally for a turn or 2. That sounds great, but because their cards get added to the card pool for those turns, and your hand draw at the start of the turn remains 6, it ends up just making it harder for you to combo your cards effectively. 

That said, this doesn't stop the combat being fun, it just means that many cards just aren't viable on the most merciless difficulties.

As regards the writing, you'll probably work out what is going to happen and when with plenty of time to spare. The final 'twist' - such as it is - is so obvious from almost the first moment that it feels almost like a plot hole that the protagonists don't see it coming and adjust their strategy accordingly. So don't expect too much from this perspective.

The characters are a mixed bag. Full disclosure - I'm not a Marvel buff, by any stretch of the imagination. I'm aphantasic and I think as a result I struggle to connect with the medium of comics. I also watch very little tv/films, so I was coming at this unaware of what I was coming into character-wise. Honestly, the game could have done with less Avengers, and more Midnight Suns. Take out the two Captains, and the game would have been far more enjoyable. Add more characters like the Midnight Suns and doubly so. 

Captain America is just dull, to be frank, and it is clear that there is no real character arc for him to go on unless, perhaps, the story is based solely upon him. Captain Marvel, on the other hand, reads like a Mary Sue of a particularly unpleasant person with no self awareness, to be blunt. In that there are strong female characters in the Suns, it was quite depressing to see a character that felt almost misogynistic (in a postmodern, irony type of way). To be fair, I genuinely don't think this is the fault of the people working on the game - I get the impression that she was written faithfully to her current characterisation. The rest of the Avengers are fine - Strange and Stark both provide comic relief at times, and display vulnerabilities that allow them to remain interesting characters; Wolverine has a wry stoicism; and Spiderman has an endearing kind of naive wonderment. If you are looking for character beats, however, you'll be looking to the Suns - particular the female members imo. It would have been nice to have more of those.

DLC, I can't comment on - I'll get them, but only in a sale. I enjoyed the game, but not enough to splurge £40 on the DLC for it. You can get some fantastic rpgs for that price. And that, as I said at the start, is my advice. Buy it, but buy it on sale. Maybe you'll enjoy it enough to get the DLC full price, and you'll still have paid the kind of money you would expect a computer game to cost.",1702073243,1702073243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

About half the game you spend just hanging out with Marvel characters and superheroes in their dorm rooms or common space. You can go on little friendship dates too like stargaze with Iron Man, pick mushrooms with Blade, etc. It's actually such a charming game because of this. 

The other half is a pretty satisfying card game who's only downfall is there's not a rogue-lite mode so you can just play the card game half as many times as you want. You're pretty much really incentivized to keep moving on and play the main story missions. Which there's a surprising lot of. 

If I could make a suggestion: don't go in expecting a very gameplay heavy game that's super complex just cuz it's from Firaxis. It's a little more casual, and more of a 45/55 split where you're spending more time with characters rather than playing the game. Which honestly is really cool.

The few that ease off this forced witless banter are good enough but still wooden/flat and the worst offender, the player character ""The Hunter"" its about as interesting as the given namesake...

The meat and potatoes of the game is the turn based, card battle, whatever. Its actually really fun, it has a lot a wee quirky cards and once you get around the environmental stuff and some of the more contextual skills it can be quite satisfying destroying a room in a single turn. Levels and enemy types are varied well enough and look damn good too. The problem i had with it were two main things. First - The battles often seem to rely too heavily on environmental damage for success, its a good chunk of the strategy, logistically annoying and doesn't make a lot of sense. Why would most the characters even need to throw an object at someone? wouldn't you just punch them it would take less effort probably and im assuming most of them probably feel harder than a crate, why do they need to vault off of an object to do a jumping attack? they can fly/portal/jump high inherently. I spend so much time punting enemies into each other or objects that it kinda feels like a weird elaborate marvel themed game of pool. Second - The scale or size of the maps, its a bit uh sad. I was hoping for more of a xcom large battlefield to navigate, you can tell more of the story on larger maps (maybe throw some of that forced flatmate banter in there), move through an area navigating and battling your way to objectives, It would be great to throw someone through a wall to create a opening to a inner facility as an alternative entrance. The scale could have been ramped up a bit, at least more grandiose destructible objects. Instead its tiny maps with wee destructible objects, but its not xcom so lets move on, Its just very limiting and doesn't feel very epic.

Then there is the Abbey/grounds, Its like a small open world/your base, but in like 3rd person roll playing game mode. Its very pretty, a bit sterile, but i find it odd the battlefields are tiny and yet so much effort and space into what amounts to an elaborate garden stroll with puzzles.. you move about rigidly, cant jump or attack anything, you read, pick plants and open chests mainly. Its a total disconnect from the main game-play, i often found myself thinking why the fuck is this here in a turn based, card strategy game? Why am intimately dealing with this characters daily walks and family mystery nonsense. Its a played out departure for narrative/story telling sake and upgrades. Im sure that all could have easily been inserted into the game more thematically, through cut scenes, different kinds of side missions/in mission conversations. Its not that its bad per say, it just begs the question, is this actually fun?

 When your not hamming it up in the yard you are contending with a superhero team leader/flatmate sim...in a magic church...its not great and again feels like another type of game tacked on. It would be completely fine if i wasn't always doing the literal leg work or if the Heroes were interesting, genuine or hell just different but they are not, so i just went through the motions of talk to superhero A this night, work out with super hero B during the day, answer random question from super hero C to increase ""friendship"" or some other resource... repeat. Tony, Strange and carol open special kinds of loot boxes for you, but in a fancy way, later you might even get to take someone on a special stroll... You personally attend to everything and make sure to pat everyone on the back afterwards... for doing one mission a day.... Such wilting flowers these heroes. The worst addition is the pseudo hero social media thing... why really, what does that add to this game but another dressed up unnecessary interaction. Where is my cutaway of the Abbey with little superheros going about there business in the various rooms where i can easily manage tasks and upgrades... Ill admit as a whole it does have a certain appealing charm/quaintness to it, but again is this actually enjoyable, is this a good use of player time? Im not sure on this one.

Graphically its really nice, Abbey/grounds are quite well done but again i think everything needs more grit, weathering, maybe some cobwebs? Still yes pretty. The spells, attacks are flashy, bold and not too played out. The heroes themselves look pretty awesome, they are certainly well done for the most part its just they seem a bit doll like, its almost like they wanted to make them and a lot of other things look comic book esk but couldn't quite commit to being stylised enough to pull it off, Parker is straight up unnerving looking. Maps and props/back ground stuff is again very nice and the enemies are down right awesome esp the demons/lith. 

All in all its still fun to see Marvel heroes pull off cool moves and kick ass, it feels great when you dominate from a well planned/executed run, i wish there was more of that in every sense. Even the Abbey stuff, played out as it is can be is somewhat charming but pick a lane is what id say to the people making this game, still if you like Marvel enough you might even enjoy the other parts.

[olist]
[*]Turn-based, tactical strategy that revolves around careful choices of moves and positioning rather than RNG;
[*]An open ""world"" (a single map, really) with a bunch of collectables and crafting;
[*]A superhero-themed social simulator where you play out slice of life scenes and guess at which responses will make people like you the most.
[/olist]
Of these, the strategy part is the thing that provides the actual entertainment and is what you're paying the price of admission for. The open world bit is just sort of there to keep you busy in between missions, and the social simulator bits... well, I'll come to that later.

The turn-based strategy is fresh and interesting. Despite being made by Firaxis, this is not ""XCOM with Marvel heroes"" at all -- every attack always hits and you know in advance how much damage you'll do, there's no two-point system for making moves but instead a system where you can reposition one character as much as you want before finalizing (normally only once per turn, though) and the moves you can make each turn are drawn at random from the collective pool of abilities you equipped on your heroes, each of which has their own distinct play style. The battlefield is strewn with environmental hazards that you can bump enemies into for extra damage or instant kills, and every move either generates or consumes ""heroism"" points, with mundane attacks generating them and high-damage flashy abilities consuming them.

It's challenging in the best sense of the word, and there are so many different heroes, abilities and modifiers that you can have many hours of fun figuring out new strategies for cards and heroes that work well together. At the highest difficulty levels, where enemies retaliate with deadly force, you have to be so careful about what to play, and when, and how, that the game almost starts to feel like a puzzle game where you either play optimally or die horribly -- in fact, the challenges for each hero to unlock their legendary abilities [i]are[/i] straight up puzzles. But if you're just here for the superhero power fantasy and puzzling is not your thing, don't worry -- the game has no less than 8 difficulty settings, on a gradual curve from ""you basically can't lose"" to ""make one mistake and it's over"", with the higher levels gradually unlocking the more successful you are on the lower levels.

The open world stuff is nothing special; you've seen this a hundred times before. There's a plethora of object collections you can complete and ""mysteries"" to investigate (which all really boil down to finding even more objects), some parts are blocked off and only opened up later as you've completed other bits, the works. Almost all of it is optional in the sense that the resources you get from this can also be obtained as rewards from missions (unless you really want those palette swaps you can only get from loot chests, I guess) and the bits of the backstory you uncover that really matter end up in conversations and cutscenes anyway, so you can do as much or as little of it as you please. It's not bad, but it's pretty obviously busywork.

And speaking of busywork, we get to the social simulator bits, and this is where things start to unravel. In terms of gameplay, you interact with characters to level up your ""friendship"", which in turn unlocks passive bonuses and legendary abilities. Lest you think this gives you some kind of opportunity to roleplay being part of your favorite superhero team, you'd best temper those expectations: your responses are limited to ""light"", ""dark"" and ""neutral"" reactions, and you will want to pick the ones that level up your own character and/or friendship as effectively as possible, as anything else basically punishes you. And no, you're not going to be kissing Captain America in the broom closet either, all your relationships (or ""friendship levels"", more accurately) are strictly platonic. Gazing at the stars is as far as you'll get, which is treated no different from fishing, gathering mushrooms, and all the other exciting things superheroes get to do when they're not punching bad guys through apartment blocks.

Rarely has a high stakes story been so undercut by requiring the player to sit through story vignettes where characters do the most mundane stuff imaginable as part of their downtime -- not by choice but as part of the leveling mechanic. It can lead to serious tonal whiplash where one moment you're returning from a mission where the bad guys have advanced their ridiculously circuitous plot for world domination by leading you into a trap and the team is at its lowest point, and the next moment you're sitting with the monthly meeting of the book club that Blade started because he's too shy to directly ask Captain Marvel out on a date. That's not me making a joke, by the way, this is a thing that actually happens in the game. The problem here is not that the story or the characters are badly written; on the contrary, every character here is faithful to their depiction in the comics. It's just that the interactions are so frequent and at the same time so anemic (and on occasion, animated in such a lackluster way, with characters standing around like zombies) that the best friend you'll have in the game is the button you use to skip the scenes. It's really rather sad when the aforementioned book club subplot ends up as one of the most interesting parts of the (side) story.

As far as recommendations go, even though everything that's not the strategy game severely overstays its welcome, the strategy game is enough to sell it. On PC you have the added bonus that there are mods to reduce the grind and tedium of the other bits, and it's very telling that those mods are among the most popular (well, after the nude mod for the ladies, of course, because gamers).

5/10 story
Why?
1) Moral Choices (-1 point)
Some dialog has light side, dark side, ties. The morality of some seem random. 
Example:
*Person a feels bad*
diolog 
a) (light side) tell them the harsh truth (+1 heart, +1 light side)
b) feel better (+1 heart)
c) (dark side) get over it (-1 heart, -1 light side {note: +1 dark point = -1 light})

*person b is sad*
a) (dark side) tell them the truth  (-1 heart, -1 light side)
b) peanuts? (+1 heart)
c) (light side) I also had a bad childhood (+1 heart, +1 light side)

This is not a exact example taken from the game but in general it is very close I one moment telling the truth is good then in another moment it is bad. On a related note some time the choices are just bad (as in all choices are just unrealistic, random dialog).  But in the end the choice really does not matter.

2) Dialog Choices (-1 points)
All of the choices have the problem of it says one thing but on choice the player says something in that is similar. 
For example: 
*Person a feels bad*
diolog 
a) (light side) tell them the harsh truth (+1 heart, +1 light side)
>b) feel better (+1 heart)
c) (dark side) get over it (-1 heart, -1 light side {note: +1 dark point = -1 light})

Hunter: ""I am very sorry to hear that. I have no wish to make you unconformable.""
Just why would you put that as ""feel better."" and again  the choice really does not matter.

3) Good moments (+2 points)
This game as some really good moments.

4)  Heroes adaption (+3 points)
Heroes for the most part feel like the COMIC version.

5) The M.C. The Hunter is written inconsistently (-1)
Hunter is somtime a person out of time, then a person

6) Dialog does not matter (-1 point)
2 main result of Dialog is friendship change, and light/dark side points.

7) The main story just spin wheels (-1 point)
During majority of the story nothing really happens the most impact-ful things that happen is a person joins you party. Thats it. 

4/10 game
Why?

1) Grind (0 point)
The game needs a bit of grinding to be on level.

2) Balance (0 point)
The balance feels off. 

3) The Bugs (-2 points)
There are thing that do not work. At the time of review you can not get one of the best passives (and armor) with out a mod.

4) The lag (-1 point)
The game on a playing level runs as well as a frog. 

5) Heros (+2 point)
Each hero feels different to play.

6) Moddable (0 point)
Some people made mods for this game.

7) The Customization Sucks (-1 point)
Very limited.

8) The game has premium currency (0 points)
It only for cosmetics.

9) The Game Locks Story Mission behind doing other noncritical missions (-1 points)
There is no reason why.

10) The day/night system is pointless (-1 points)
The system of days do not countdown to doom. They tick research counter and refresh other things. It would be cool to see a countdown to dooms day or have events happen on curtain days here there is no real point.

11) game has 2 modes (0 points)
a) walking around the Abbey
Here you get upgrades and prep for a mission

b) Turn Based Card Game
This is the Mission.

12) core game is good (+2 points)
It fun and is a OK time-waster.

13) The game looks bad. (0 point)
The models are just plain bad on any setting.

DLC 5/10

1) It overpriced (That's Bad)
2) You can get it all with the Legendary Edition [on sale $30] (That's Good)
3) The DLC is kinda short (That's Bad)
4) The DLC adds a new spin to gameplay (That's Good)
5)  There is no more DLC (That's Bad)
6) The DLC has good writing (That's Good)
7) After the DLC the Heroes do practically nothing (That's Bad)
8) The DLC is Animated Well (That's Good)
9) The  DLC has it's own boss (That's Good)
10) The quality of the DLC is simular to the rest of the game (That is bad)",1701826532,1701826824,False,3,0,0.494809657335281372,0,True,False,False

Midnight Suns takes the above and mashes them into a surprisingly addictive, entertaining, and fun game! There’s a depth to the skills and card building as well as the character interactions between missions, albeit with some fair amount of grinding.

I’ll also say I am biased because I’ve loved Marvel comics since I was a kid, so this is probably nostalgia-upping the review, but hey – shrug. At least I’m being honest here.

I’m surprised this isn’t more popular rn in 2023 as I write this half-assed review. My unproven hypothesis is that so many people got Marvel fatigue after Avengers: Endgame finished conjoined with a lot of mediocre Marvel content since then, that many are just too sceptical and Marvel-fatigued to touch yet ANOTHER Marvel piece of entertainment.

Well, I got good news! This game is often on sale on Steam many times at 75% off. So I recommend putting it on your wishlist and waiting for a sale. It’ll come soon enough unless death takes you first.

A better comparison is Into the Breach crossed with Slay the Spire, and turns out that if you put those two games in a blender and pour in some Marvel it makes a damn fine smoothie.

It's got some issues, the UI can be painful sometimes (jumping through different menu to cash in cards to upgrade others, moving around on the map to get the perfect dash attack lined up) and the plot is nonsensical bordering on incomprehensible, but it doesn't detract much from the gem of its core gameplay.

I was genuinely sad when I finished all the DLCs and realised I wasn't going to hang out with the characters any more, especially when it was so obviously set up for a sequel.

But ""Marvel's Midnight Suns"" leaps off the page, proving that not only can this idea work, it can be extraordinarily fun and engaging. The game starts off at a gentle pace, offering a few options to get your superhero boots wet. However, as you delve deeper and start upgrading and unlocking abilities, the true brilliance of the game begins to shine like the gleam off Captain America's shield.

Each character in your squad brings their own unique flair and power to the table, transforming every battle into a high-stakes, strategic puzzle. It's not just about throwing punches or blasting energy beams; it's about crafting the perfect strategy to outwit and overpower your foes. And with the top-notch voice acting, sleek design, and spectacular battle animations, each encounter feels like you're living out your favorite comic book scenes in real time.

But the heart of ""Marvel's Midnight Suns"" lies in the Abbey and its cast of characters. The game strikes a perfect balance between different Marvel IPs, offering a diverse and well-rounded roster. The real joy comes from interacting with these iconic heroes and villains, watching them grow and evolve through an original story that's as compelling as any Marvel blockbuster. As an original character, you're not just observing the action – you're an integral part of it, forming relationships and making decisions that shape the course of the narrative.

The game's pacing is masterful, always leaving you eager to see what the next day will bring, be it new developments at the Abbey, advancements in your research, or shifts in your relationships. It's the kind of game that keeps you saying, ""Just one more day,"" as you get more entangled in its engaging world.

The only kryptonite to this superhero saga is the occasional bug that pops up, a reminder that even heroes aren't perfect. And while it's a heartbreaker that the game didn't soar as high as it deserved in the commercial skies, leaving the prospect of a sequel in doubt, ""Marvel's Midnight Suns"" stands tall as a testament to innovation and creativity in gaming. It's a game that took a bold leap, flew into uncharted territory, and landed gracefully, proving that sometimes, the most unconventional ideas can lead to the most extraordinary adventures.",1701621406,1701621406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It could have been great but is held back by some poor design choices that turn the game into a chore. Thankfully a lot of boring stuff can be sped up with mods.

I recommend the following to make this game worth your time:
[list]
    [*]Don't play this game without a SSD. There's a lot of loading.
    [*]Don't buy it at full price. Wait until a sale.
    [*]Ignore the microtransactions. They're for cosmetics.
    [*]Look up how to bypass the 2K launcher so your performance isn't trash. There's a guide here on Steam that shows you how to do this.
    [*]Once you are comfortable with the game's mechanics (I'd suggest when you hit level 5), install mods to increase mission rewards and friendship rewards. x5 is a reasonable setting for those mods for a first playthrough.
    [*]Focus on the heroes you like, and don't worry about the others falling behind. Once you get the THREAT Room upgrade, you can catch others up. Install the CHEESE Room mod so the THREAT room wastes less of your time.
    [*]Ignore the Abbey stuff if you find it boring and don't care about cosmetics. Most of the cosmetics look awful anyway. The increased mission rewards mods will make up for any resources this provides.
    [*]If you want to mess around with the Abbey stuff, install the mod that increase Arcane Level ups.

I bought it thinking it was a tactical turn-based strategy game, and a portion of the game is that, but a majority of your time will be in cutscenes, dialogue, and building understanding of people and social relationships. In short, it's a role-playing game. BUT that's not the issue here.

THIS GAME IS A SATANIC CULT ACCLIMATOR. NO JOKE!

You may laugh, mock me in the comments, and such, but at least first check my evidence.

EVIDENCE #1 - PLOT AND SETTING

We start out with the evil villains resurrecting an ultra-powerful witch-demon from the dead. They are immediately rewarded for this dark act of necromancy by being slaughtered by the evil witch-demon. Classic villainy.

So how do our heroes respond? They immediately form a witch coven in Salem, Massachusetts and perform their own necromancy raising their own witch-warrior from the grave. Funny how we see no consequences for dark arts when our heroes do it.

EVIDENCE #2 - CHARACTERS

So where are our noble heroes? Captain America, Black Panther, the X-Men, even Guardians of the Galaxy. No, even the shallow moral code of the fictional heroes is too much for our cult, where independent thinking is not allowed. Right away, nearly every hero you get is a practitioner of dark arts, possessed by a demon, or otherwise fundamentally evil.

Behind the casual wit, you'll notice every character follows a personality pattern of vast ego, self-entitlement, and no questioning the ego of others. Motivation is gaining power and forbidden knowledge. Method is end justifies the means. This is the exact personality of a real-life Satanist. Notice no humility, no moral boundaries, and no standards or fear of repercussions.

EVIDENCE #3 - DIALOGUE

Cults carry certain values, self-entitlement, pleasure, self-empowerment, and a quest for hidden knowledge. They won't mention that you receive these benefits for only a brief time and at a self-destructively fast rate, and that it comes with major penalties including numbness to good things, pain and horror for you and your loved ones, and loss of your body, mind, and soul.

Sure, in game you'll be given dialogue options of ""LIGHT"" or ""DARK"", but may you notice that the developers' view of morality perfectly aligns with Satanism and cult values. If you suggest that it was ok to let Wanda leave the coven for the real world, then expect to be marked as 'DARK'. This matches the cultist ideal of ""never leaving the family"". At the same time, if you suggest we shouldn't use evil methods to fight evil, expect to lose friendship points and be openly mocked by the characters, only to find the evil methods are integrated as core game mechanics. This perspective is integrated in ALL the game’s dialogue.

EVIDENCE #4 - SOCIAL GAME

Cults recruit others by a method called love-bombing. They will be exceptionally affectionate and attentive to new recruits to quickly form emotional bonds in those recruits, before they know what is happening. Then, once they are emotionally addicted to the attention and affection, they are manipulated into horribly dangerous and self-sacrificial things, ranging from giving up your life savings to allowing your body to be possessed by a demon.

Love-bombing (minus the major downsides) is represented in the game by the friendship system. You MUST spend dialogue time with the other demon worshippers to develop your abilities in the tactical game. The first time you decline, Nico with her pentagram necklace will follow you to your room and accept nothing less than you watching a movie with her, ignoring all your arguments to the contrary. The game means to portray this in a kind light, as if someone who loves you will force you to be with them. THIS IS NOT TRUE. If this happens to you, beware! At best this is a toxic friendship, but at worst it could be a gateway to a dangerous group.

Speaking of such, the game will have you join an EMO KIDS group, portrayed as just as casual and innocent as a weight-lifting or Pokemon club. Except the club meets at night in the woods performing dark rituals on a stone altar. IN REAL LIFE, THIS IS NOT SAFE! These clubs absolutely exist in real life, but they are not innocent, and will cost you greatly! The benefits they promise are not worth it.

EVIDENCE #5 - GOOD AND EVIL SMOOTHIE

Tarot cards, pentagrams, blood magic, and more dangerous things are all introduced casually into this game. Other games may portray these things as elements of the evil side, but this game clearly intends to blur the lines of evil and good, normalizing these things for the player. The term ""Midnight Suns"" references the game's theme that good and evil can be blended. The game teaches that you can tap into the power of evil and use it for good reasons.

In real life, this is not true. DEMONIC SPIRITS ARE REAL, and for their persistence in evil, they are condemned by the Creator God. For this, they are absolutely furious, and their ONLY GOAL IS TO HURT US as much as possible in retaliation before time runs out. They have also received a series of judgments that has limited their power (for the most part) to whispering lies to our spirits, nudging us in the wrong direction. However, they can temporarily gain power if they successfully convince us to give up our own power to them.

That is where Satanic cults and their methodologies come in. Everything from Ouija boards to pentagrams to Tarot cards are methods of us humans passing our power to an evil spirit. Sometimes they trick us into doing it for free, such as when you think it's all harmless fun. Other times, they will entice you with lies of power or hidden knowledge, as in Eden. ""You will not surely die,"" the serpent said to the woman. ""For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."" What they will never tell you is that the benefits are brief and petty, while the penalties are massive.

CONCLUSION

This game is intentionally and skillfully designed to acclimate the unaware to being comfortable with evil, yet the game does not portray the horrible downsides. Stay away from evil! Learn how to identify it, and flee from it. If you want knowledge that is clear of lies, study the Bible, the Book of Truth. Not only will it clean up your life, but if you trust Jesus as your Savior from sin, you’ll be gifted eternal life and then the fountain of knowledge will never stop.

Edit (11-29-2023)

OK so I hate to drop $60 on a game only to give up on it so I kept at it.  I stick with my initial impression.  This game is VERY slow to get you into the action.  However, once you figure out how to skip through the endless (and pointless) dialog and get into some actual game play it's pretty fun.  Repetitive yes but the developers obviously went to pains to stretch the game mechanics to make it as diverse as those mechanics would allow. 

I'm now almost 90 hours in and at least now I do not regret my purchase though I do think the developers could really make some quality of life improvements.  For example, after every mission you must go to sleep.  Is it really necessary to make us sit through the crawling into bed and then waking up animations EVERY time?  Granted it's only a few seconds here and there but doing it hundreds of times gets annoying and is needless.

Also, the game mechanic of almost all attack cards being knock backs and the important foes to defeat being immune is just annoying.  I know it is a way to add challenge to the missions, but, it just gets irritating when the cards you draw leave you impotent over and over to actually attack.  Especially towards the end game.  

Conclusion, is this a good game?  I don't know.  If you don't mind the ENDLESS dialog or don't mind bashing a button or key a bazillion times to just skip through it.  Sure, OK, it can be fun.",1700414808,1701269021,False,3,0,0.418829143047332764,0,True,False,False

It's a solid X-Com like game with the spin of you build a deck of cards for each character's actions. There's different types of cards and restrictions on what you can play. Overall the battle system is a lot of fun and puts a nice little spin on the traditional X-Com style tactical game.

The storyline itself is okay. Nothing too amazing but about what you would expect from a Marvel videogame. The voice acting can be pretty hit or miss depending on the character.

My most played games are rogue-likes and MOBAs, so sinking time into a game can really feel like a chore, and maintaining investment is difficult for me.

THAT BEING SAID, this game is amazing and had me hooked from an early point. Playing this game made me feel like I was playing an old Playstation 2 game where the developers almost seemed like they didn't hate their job, and just had a passion for making a good game.

So when I originally seen the core gameplay (especially when I did the tutorial), I thought that a card battler is a dumb idea for an XCOM like game, along with limitations of 3 card plays a turn, movement system also seemingly shallow because you can traverse only one character only once wherever you choose in the whole area. All of this gave so much impression to me that this game is probably shallow in terms of mechanical depth. To say the least; I stand completely wrong for thinking that. 68 hours in at this time of review and I spend many minutes on end trying to think my turn out and maximize the most of my limited actions, while also preparing for the repercussions of what the choices of my actions will be, and even beyond that the deckbuilding system is so unique for each of the characters playstyles and is generally flavored to the characters powers themselves ie Spiderman throws people around, binds them, and benefits a lot more from environmental usage compared to Captain America who usually focuses more on building up block for your team and taunting enemies to be the frontline of defense. There's also The Hunter who is technically your main character and his/her deckbuilding is probably the most vast in the game based on if you went down a light path, dark path, or any other kind of builds you can make out of them.

Continuing on beyond the core gameplay, the characters and interactions you have with them are very surprisingly true to all of their actual comic counterparts and interacting with them through socializing can actually lead to some interesting and meaningful conversations that go beyond the gimmicks of their characters. There are sooooo many lines of dialogue that even though I tend to be invested I skim through a lot of it, but the writing is still pretty good overall and I will stand by that any day.

Comparable to XCOM you have a main base type of area called the Abbey. You can explore the Abbey island and find interesting things about the plot of land, but most of this is secondary content and you can pretty much completely ignore it if it's not your cup of tea. The Abbey itself allows you to do research, get more cards for characters, hang out with some of the heroes, and can be actually upgraded and customized more than you would think.

For the record this game does have microtransactions apparently, but I actually only just found this fact out 68 hours in so I think that says enough about how irrelevant they are to the actual game.

I will say bugs are slightly common, but not once did I have a single bug that actually hindered my progress or broke the game. At most my experience were just visual hiccups, one dialogue line overlapping another briefly, and other small things that weren't very notable.

Overall I'd say if you like XCOM this game has a lot of depth and is definitely worth giving a shot. If you're a big Marvel fan this game is true to what you're seeking from that. If you're neither of those people, then I would still recommend this game if it's on sale, because there truly is a lot going for this game and it might be a good introduction into a different genre for you.",1701022765,1701022765,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Characters and story surprisingly remind me of some of the golden age Bioware games like the original Mass Effect and Dragon Age. Biggest con is definitely how buggy the game is, but that's something that has gotten better over the time I've played it and will ostensibly continue to get better as time goes on.

Edit: Coming back later and putting some more time in a few months after some more patches and DLC drops, and it really has cemented my feeling that there's something missing here that's really difficult to put my finger on.

The game felt dissonant to me, isolated in a vacuum the systems work fine but together they either needed Midnight Suns to be a strategy card battler or turn-based strategy rpg, including character skill tree and points allocation, not the mixed nuts serving we got.

The hero roster is the classes/companions found in other turn-based rpg's and served their function in combat and had different personalities for you to engage with which meant little in the grand scheme as you will be doing the exact same activity with each over and over trying to get incremental buffs. So yeah i really didn't care what Spider-man (or anyone) had to say the eighth time we 'hungout' watching a movie or stargazing or standing on a cliff staring out into the ocean. You will need to 'hangout' a lot in order to level up your friendship and consequently get the buffs which are especially useful for the higher difficulties.

I was so disconnected by the third act i just skipped all dialogue and cut-scenes (that i could) from the final few Transia missions and friendship hangouts along with all the end credits. Just so i could say it was finished and not feel like i totally wasted 68 hours of my life.

Despite that statement above the writing and story aren't bad at all, the games strongest point is actually the story. It is the systemic tedium derived from trying to play through the story, enduring the repetitive combat and friendship hangouts, that makes it average.

The combat system is easy to learn and not too difficult to master however card effects and traits can be convoluted and there isn't a great tutorial for newcomers to the genre. Combat does lack any sense of tension or fun once the initial thrill of learning it subsides. 

Cards/powers for you heroes are gained based on a 'rng' system, you can end up with the multiple copies of the same card which isn't a bad thing per se as they are a source of resources needed for upgrades or can be used to upgrade themselves. They are unlocked at the end of missions via the forge, can be created and upgraded through the latter using blueprints or sometimes earned by completing the friendship quests such as the book club and emo kids and sending heroes out on 'ops'. 

I feel there was a huge opportunity missed to engage and empower players to build each hero the way we wanted instead of grinding away to get 'rng' cards which may or may not be what we wanted. More than once i just discarded entire groups of cards (for resources i didn't need) because i had powered them up and modified them to where i wanted and yet i kept getting copies of them forcing me to go out on bland general missions to grind for more.

i recommend this for Marvel diehards who don't care what they play as long as it has Marvel heroes in it.",1700971584,1700971584,False,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

- The Fights
- Social Interactions
- Exploration and Management


Social Interactions:
Really great Game for People who read Marvel Comics in the 80s & 90s.
Comics at that time had a great balance of Action and personal ""Drama"" (everyone who read 80s FF or Avengers knows what i mean).
I think i never played a Marvel game were the characters had more personality.
At the start its only a few characters but later there are NPC conversations everywhere.
Logan sits at the Bar and tells Wanda about that time Hulk ripped him appart, Peter tries to contact his aunt and Carol reacts to it, Cap and Ghostrider playing a Videogame and Cap talks about a giant monkey on a Platform and so much more.
And all of this without interaction of the Player, these little moments are just there, in the Background.
At these moments, the characters feel almost alive.
The conversations with the NPC´s are great too, they come to you with there problems, wanna talk about there past or just wanna watch a movie to come down after a big fight.
Some Characters act like Aholes, you can react to it and it changes there behavior.
There are even ""social quests"", where a character asks you about a favor.

The Fights:
The fights start simple but over time you start to understand more and more (and get more abilities).
And  at the end you chain attacks, make complex combos between the characters and get more an more out of your fight. 
The progression feels so smooth that i only realised it at the start of New Game+.
First i was skeptic about the Card aspect but it works great.

Exploration and Management:
You have your big hub area, its where all the social interations happen but its much more.
You can explore the whole area (forests, graveyards, old churches, occult places etc), solve (simple puzzles), find items/recources, find new locations (for social interactions), find out about the lore of diffrent characters.
Upgrade Abilities and equipment, research new stuff for the hub area and so much more.

Is the Game perfect? Nope.
I had some minor bugs (interaction prompts not showing up, decorations not working right, black screen in conversations).
But there where rare (at least at my time with the game).
Othere stuff annoyed me much more, ""social quests"" that where imposible (gain a friendship level with character x in 3 days, but character x had no interest in talking to me for a 4-5 days), a big framerate drop in the final fight, ingame DLC with premium curency (cosmetics), not be able to heal your own character from injuries at the hub (even you can do that with NPC´s), reseach that is tied to ""how often you took a character on to missions"", not be able to manage anything in the evenig (after the fights).


Would i recommend it?
For fans of old Comics that really liked the private/personal side of the heros, absolutely!
Best Marvel experience in years!

For fans of XCom-like tactic games?
Not so much, the fights CAN get complex and fun but are just a third of the whole game and in only small areas.

Its more for People who liked Valkyria Chronicels, good short fights, much bigger social aspect.

However I gotta say, it's rather spectacular, entertaining and opened up a whole new avenue of games for me to try.
Here's a Pros & Cons list.

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
+ Customisable main character. Ability to customise team-mate outfits. There is a fair amount of customising in this game.
+ Wide Variety of Heroes / Anti-Heroes to choose from (Iron Man, Ghost Rider, Deadpool, Blade, Storm & Spider-Man to name a few). With plenty of villains to match.
+ Exploration - Before & after mission exploration, allowing you to learn some lore, gain collectables, improve friendship levels with other heroes & improve heroes abilities and outfits.
+ Plenty of abilities, unique to each hero, allowing you to find your perfect play-style.
+ Voice acting is top notch.
+ Visually pleasing to look at.
+ Great story, great writing. Deadpool & Blade is a duo I never realised I needed until I played this. Combines humour and seriousness rather well.

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
- Noticeable FPS drops in certain areas (The Abbey to The Yard / The Abbey to The Forge areas). Mostly smooth everywhere else.
- Certain dialogues overlap. (Listening to 2 different people talk at the same time). Rather sporadic when it occurs.
- Only one mission per in-game day. It'd be nice if I can do 2-3 missions a day before having my heroes rest. Instead, you're forced to rest after 1 mission. 
- Pricing. The best edition which includes the season pass & a few hero customisation options, is a bit pricey at £90.

Overall, as a game that's introduced me to a whole new genre of games, I'd say it's definitely worth playing.
Although with how pricey the best edition is, I'd recommend buying it on a discount of 40%.

One aspect without the other, and the game wouldn't work as well. As it is, there's a very satisfying gameplay loop. There's also an exploration aspect around your abbey headquarters, in nature, as a bonus that I liked, but that can be ignored most of the time.

My first impressions weren't great, I thought the graphics were a bit lacking for a AAA game, while still decent, but they did grow on me as time went by, especially the character models. Combat animations were brief and spectactular. Graphics in the battle fields were very good.

I'm not usually a fan of strategy games with card decks or so-called card battlers, but this one won me over. It becomes quite fun once you get the hang of it. There's depth and variety while also keeping things relatively simple. I particularly loved the knockback attacks. The field of battle is limited in size, this is not X-Com, but I thought the size was appropriate: not too big or too small. Every playable hero plays different and there didn't seem to be any clunkers. In fact, I was surprised how much I played every single hero, even though I had my favorites.

The social adventure aspect, where you build up relationships, is wonderful and obviously inspired by the Persona games. There are clubs to attend, hangouts with individual heroes, an electronic social network, and you see heroes talking to each other, training, lounging, etc, in your headquarters. It's mostly talking with a few choices here and there, but it's very well written and interesting, especially if you're a Marvel fan. It's the superhero game where it feels like I learned the most about the characters, perhaps not in term of histories, but in terms of personalities and what makes them tick.

You play as your own new character created for the game, the Hunter, male or female with customization options, and it was rather well done. He was cool, had a great voice (don't know for female), and I liked playing him. I also liked the story, not as much as the friendly character interactions, although the store page unfortunately spoils a few big things if you pay attention. The voices were mostly very good and well chosen. Highlights were Nico Minoru (played by the Runaways tv show actress), Blade (played by movie Spawn) and Captain Marvel, but your preferences will vary.

I can't go into everything, but there's a lot I could have written about, such as the text-based hero ops, levelling your card deck for each hero, decorating your room, buying clothes, creating battle items, buying gifts to offer and, of course, exploring around the grounds. They make for interesting distractions, make the game richer, and you can mostly ignore the stuff you like the least.

What I disliked was the lack of enemy variety and super-villains. For the first 30 hours or so, I mostly fought Hydra goons (think modern Nazis) and I got sick and tired of them. Then you get another set of enemies that are more interesting. Super-villains are few and far between, although they're well designed and fun to fight. Another thing I disliked were the constant enemy reinforcements appearing almost every turn. They quickly grew tiresome. I get it was probably done to keep the challenge up and to surprise, but I could have done without it or at least not as often. Last thing are the super-hero costumes, beyond your own, locked behind a pay wall with real money. They're cosmetic, there's only two extras for each hero, but in older games they would have been unlocks. As it is, for each hero except yourself, you get one initial costume (with a choice of unlockable colours) and the Midnight Sun costume near the end.

Despite my few gripes, I definitely recommend Marvel's Midnight Suns. The sum is greater than its mighty marvellous parts. *****",1678648388,1700880306,True,126,3,0.897561371326446533,11,True,False,False

You play as an original, fully customisable character called the Hunter, child of the game's main antagonist - Lilith, the Mother of Demons. The Hunter joins forces with beloved heroes and anti-heroes including members of the X-Men, Avengers, Runaways, and X-Force, to save the world from the Mother of Demons and her waves of Hydra forces, bolstered by her demon-spawn and some notorious super-villains. 

The cast of characters is great. I'm not a Marvel superfan and have only bought a few comics here and there, but I grew up watching the 90's Spider-Man and X-Men animated shows, seen a lot of the movies and played a lot of games, so my familiarity varies from character to character. That being said, I like that there are some I didn't know at all before I played the game. Every character is fleshed out and has a lot to say about themselves, other team members, and their nemesis, both past and present.

Each member of the team comes with multiple, customisable clothing options for both work and leisure. More importantly, though, every character has a deck of ability cards that can be upgraded and augmented, and used on combat missions.

The combat is where the game really shines - and I was sceptical at first because I'll admit it looks pretty unusual, even for a fan of strategy games like XCOM.
You take a team of up to three heroes on each mission, and randomly draw from each hero's deck to make your hand. You get a limited number of redraws and card plays each turn. Each card either generates or costs Heroism points, a resource which the team share. Weaker attacks might grant you one or two Heroism, while stronger abilities might cost you 3 or 4 Heroism. You can also spend Heroism points on interacting with the environment by toppling a streetlamp over some Hydra goons, or kicking a table into a pack of demon dogs. Movement points are also taken from a shared pool.

Movement is interesting. You usually start each round with one movement point, which you can spend on moving one hero where ever you want in the arena. Some cards can grant additional movement points, and you can unlock the ability to spend movement points on things like curing a team mate, or shoving an enemy.
Whether or not you have movement points, some cards will move the heroes around the arena while performing abilities. For example, if you pick a Hunter attack card and then highlight an enemy that is across the arena from Hunter, a symbol will appear on the arena floor showing you where Hunter will be once you play this card. With this attack you'll move over there, but this skill will move you to here, etc. This adds an interesting layer of tactical challenge.
You only have one movement point, but all three of your heroes are going to be hurt in an area of effect attack next turn if they stay where they are - can you get all three of them out of the blast zone? Can you position enemies so they get hurt instead of you? You can't always decide exactly where a hero moves to, but it always gives you the information you need to weigh the pros and cons of each possible move.

There are some really cool abilities with great character animations, sound and visual effects that go along with them so, whether you're summoning a mystic vortex or smashing with big green fists, actions feel like they pack a punch.

The combat is what keeps me playing, but that is only part of the full Midnight Suns experience...

A Day in the Life of Hunter:
Wake up in a new T Shirt and Jeans
Pet my demon dog
Give some philosophical advice to an Avenger
Console an angry goth girl whose friend has been brainwashed
Do some training with a team mate, giving them an edge in their next mission and strengthening your bond
Inspect a magical artefact
Assign a research project to expand the base
Send a hero out on a solo mission
Pick a mission to play and go kick some butt
Get home, get back into my Tshirt and jeans
Work hard, play hard.
Sit in the hot tub with Wolverine and chat about our feelings
Give him a gift I think he'll really like
Go explore the eerie grounds around the base and pick some mushrooms
Go to bed in your Tshirt and jeans

I was greatly surprised by the graphics of this game - they are amazing. The textures and lighting look realkly good in 4K. The only complaint I have is that a few of the animations are stiff. This is more noticeable during 3rd person section of the game. Instead of an overview of the base, this time you control a character in 3rd person to explore around and have conversations. I found that this led to an increased sense of feeling part of the world.

People who are expecting yet another Rogue-Like card builder or a x-com clone should stay away from this game because even though it looks similiar on surface , deep down in game design there are massive differences. And , this is NOT a RPG, you cannot ""create your own hero"" and choose powers from a set of 100s. You have some leeway with the gender and appearance but the character's story and his/her powers is mostly rigid. Which is the right choice to tell a good story.

Many of the negative reviews I read make me face palm, as they barely scratched the surface with 5 to 10 hours or rushed the game to the point they are literally not engaging with 80 % of the game. Besides many complaints are about overpriced DLC ( which you absolutely do not need to buy ) or about technical glitches of which I encountered a total of zero in 100 hours. I rarely defend any game in steam but here the hate is absolutely not warranted and the fault is here with the customer not the game. Most of them are probably from salty misinformed day-1 purchases.

--- Combat ---
It has tactical combat which plays akin to x-com series, on top, it utilizes a deck Building system for the abilities of your heroes. 
What is different in Midnight Suns though is it does not share the urgency and danger of a x-com campaign. You do not permanently lose your heroes. Which makes it a very different - and better in my opinion - experience. That is why I do not think people who want another hardcore x-com experience will like this game. 
Similiarly card system is not there for you to make a vastly different build. But rather it enables you to change your heroes skills slightly to better suit your composition and spice up the combat by familiar card-battle mechanics. For an example you cannot make Blade to be a Support character as much as you try, his main focus is DPS. This is why I also think that people who want a solid TGC or a Rogue-Like akin to Slay the Spire should tamper their expectations. 

---Exploration---
Missions are separated into story missions and side missions which you can do in your own pace. That is crucial for the game does not force you to do something in X days , so you can take your time to level your heroes with side missions, build up and explore the abbey (your base) , and connect with the residents.

The abbey and its surroundings is masterfully crafted and has it's own meta exploration mystery, in which you try to unravel the past and the backstory. You progress through this via a metrovid-style skill blocked progression system which assures you do not burn through all the exploration in 1 night. Even after 100 hours I am still not finished with exploration. And I was very thorough. The collectible Books and Lore is actually relevant to the main story which deepens your understanding too why is all this happening. 

---Social System---
The social system in place -which does not deserve the hate it recieves-  enables you to build up friendship with the resident heroes and unlock better skills and synergies with them. There is tons of well voiced dialogue in this game. After 100 hours I am yet to hear a dialogue repeat itself. Is it sometimes cheesy and emo? Well yes, but this comes with the Comic territory. That is the quality you can expect. People who are complaining that the dialogue is bad probably never read a marvel comic in their lives and are here to complain because they watched an Angry Joe review. (who actually liked the game).
Yes the social system is not Persona, but it is better than your average banter system they slap into each game nowadays. It actually reminds me of Bioware games of old. 

---Story---
Story is actually good for a Marvel IP. I would consider it at the same level as the story of any avenger movie. At the end of the day it is a comic story and is not made to compete with Elden Ring or a David Lynch script. But it has enough action, cheese and ups and downs to be better than anything MCU is producing in Phase 4. Yet again, I cannot comprehend how people can hate the story of this game , it is as solid as any DC Arkham game. 

---Technical---
Graphics are very good , and game never dips below 60 frames (borderless v-sync) with my 3080. It definitely feels polished and never ever crashed in 100 hours. I encountered 0 bugs, be it in the UI or in Animations, which are top-notch. Effects are spectacular. Soundtrack is well done and integrates itself into the game well enough. I cannot confirm any anti-cheat software reducing my Framerate in any way. Again the complains here should not be taken seriously. Just don't try to play the game with a potato.

---Cosmetics---
Game also has tons of cosmetic options which are unlocked via chests scattered around the Abbey and its surroundings, via social interactions or directly available to purchase with the in-game currency. I saw a premium currency in the inventory but never seen a shop for it, and did not ever had the need to buy anything because I am yet to unlock all cosmetics I saw. Even If I would like to spend some cash , which I never do, I would not now where. The game does not promote its in-game store to the point is is only available in the main menu. Once you are in the game you cannot even access the marketplace! I am not saying that MTX is good but Midnight Suns keeps it to meaningless cosmetics an hides it away. 

---Conclusion---
I did not have any expectations for the midnight suns and was positively impressed by it. I am playing nothing else than this game since I picked it up and I immediately fell in love with it to a degree that I am looking to do a second run with a female Character. After 100 hours I was literally feeling dread because I thought the game will end soon but instead of a end-game cutscene I just progressed into the act 2. I sincerely believe that the game deserves better. This has the potential to be a very good franchise.

I wouldn't say it has done anything revolutionary here - outside of trying to combine elements of several genres - but the animations and the voice acting for me was both spot on and top notch. It's not an action title so don't expect that - it's a story told during deck development with some base modifications along the way.

Does it get repetitive? I suppose, but I like what this game does so I don't mind it. I've put about 50 hours in and I feel like there's still a bit more to see - but I chose to slowly develop all available characters.

So who should buy this? Anyone into Marvel who can tolerate a card battler would find value here. People who like strategy elements in their games might enjoy this too.

At first I was a little disappointed that it wasn't Xcom3 but after around hour 2 I started to REALLY get into it.
There is quite a large side game (Think Persona 5) of exploring/dating sim that actually is quite fun (easy but fun)

I am sure I will be playing this for quite some time, again it's not Xcom but it doesn't really have to be.
If you are not a comic fan like me you can still enjoy this game without knowing the backstorys of the diffeent heroes. The game does a good job at helping you get accustomed to the different heroes.

I feel it was worth every penny and would not hesitate to buy it, I am over 230 hours in and finally starting to get the itch to play something else.
This game is about as perfect as it gets Xcom combat wise.
The Role playing element is ok, its not the selling point but it is fun and provides a good break between the super fun action.

Only real problem I have had with the game is that I like it so much that I actually wanted to do it 100% however there are a few bugs that have stopped me from getting 100percent.

I was sold on it when reviews came out and mentioned hanging out with superheroes with relationship levels, like in Persona. But I have to say the parts in the Abbey are the more tedious aspects.

I admit, the story and characters aren't so interesting to me (although Marvel fans may disagree), but I did greatly enjoy using the card system and its upgrade/mod abilities to create interesting and fun characters to take into battle. I also appreciated the high number of difficulty levels to chose from as they become unlocked as they did ease you into increasingly more challenging encounters. From a purely game mechanics level, this game represents a culmination of the work Jake Solomon oversaw at Firaxis; it is sleek, simple, but highly adjustable in ways that encourage deeper thinking on character composition.

It's kind of a friendship simulator and a card based tactics game that exist next to one another. Both games on their own are a little shallow, but together they provide an entertaining experience.

The majority characters in the friendship simulator are believably flawed, but they don't act very believably given the situations their in. More importantly, None of your choices with the characters have an impact on the narrative. Had there been ten or fifteen less hero's in the game, but your relationship with the characters had an impact on the story, the game would have felt far more complete and been more entertaining. This also would have given the game far more replay value in my opinion.

The systems and mechanics in the tactics half of the game are stellar. That's why its so painful that almost all of the mission types feel exactly the same. Most missions end with ""kill all of the remaining enemies"", and I believe that cutting that requirement alone would have greatly helped make all of the mission types feel more distinct and made the game feel far less repetitive.

So why recommend the game? Whenever one half of the game wears thin, it's pretty easy to jump into the other half. It's not as seamless as it should be, but it's easy enough, and the game has enough entertainment value to warrant 100 hours or so of play.",1700701196,1700701196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
368260,128333643,76561198134200108,0,3,4877,0,3168,1671907378,"It's beyond a doubt one of the best Marvel games I've ever played and I'm typically not a big tactical turn-based player. The story is compelling and the interactions with the Marvel heroes is a lot of fun. I have to admit, I never thought a book club with Captain Marvel was something I wanted, but I found myself looking forward to each meeting after a particularly rough battle the day before. Firaxis dug deep into Marvel lore too because the sheer amount of dialogue opportunities is insane to me (How could you forget about your precious Chewie, Carol? You monster!). 

Though some complain about the character models, I didn't take issue with them. I wish there were more unlockable costumes for the heroes awarded through gameplay, but it's possible those are coming later. I hope this game goes on for awhile, and I definitely hope there's a sequel. Heck, the format would be perfect for other teams too. I would totally play a turn-based Defenders or X-Men game (just in case you're reading this Firaxis) if they produced them. 

Which brings me to the combat. It's like the most sadistic game of billiards I've ever played. I genuinely loved watching each one of my heroes getting more and more powerful with each training session, hero op, and hangout. Suddenly, Spiderman was wiping the board in a single turn, Carol became essentially invulnerable, and I cleared two waves with Nico's Witchfire without the enemy even getting a single turn. In short, Firaxis achieves in a short time span what so many superhero games have struggled with in the past: It makes you feel like you're controlling mortal gods.

Collecting cards and powering them up is a satisfying mechanic in and of itself, but seeing them in action is even better. The animations (when they aren't choppy, which we'll get to in a minute) are super fun. Hearing Logan roar never seems to get old for me. Strange winding up with a purple tornado to bounce an enemy into an exploding barrel is a treat. And dropping portals with Illyana and spear tackling enemies through limbo into their comrades? Priceless. While the dialogue and worldbuilding are great, the combat is where Midnight Suns really shines. 

That being said it's not without it's flaws. I have a pretty nice PC and pre-patch I was suffering from a lot of the issues most players were with long load times and buggy menus. Post-patch I'm suffering sporadic crashes. I have to admit though, those technical flaws don't diminish my enthusiasm for the game, frustrating though they may be. I'm also not a big fan of releasing a $50 DLC pack on day one, but that's hardly outrageous in this day and age.

I'd recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of turn-based tactical games. As for players who aren't, but still love the Marvel genre, there's a story mode that should make the combat a little less frustrating. I can't wait to finish playing the core game. I'll definitely be scooping up the DLC at some point too. If for no other reason than I hope driving sales spurs Firaxis to drop a sequel.",1670726584,1700700653,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

First things first, yes I am a Marvel fan and yes I am a turn-based/deck builder games fan. I enjoyed XCOM a lot, many people compare it to that (it's from the same studio after all), however it's quite different, 

What really dominates in this game are deck building elements (collecting cards, upgrading them, building decks) and believe it or not, also socializing, joking around with all the heroes. Combat often felt just as a mean to progress in the story or to get to another day and talk again, explore, train etc... It never was the main focus.

And now the fun part, the combat was actually really good. Very thought out and balanced, made me really think about the steps I have to take in order to win. Huge variety of combat scenarios, different environments, engaging music even. It all clicked together perfectly. Having such a quality combat while it's not even the focal point of the game speaks absolute volumes.

The Abbey, where you spend most of the time, was beautiful. Heroes you are talking to were well written, dialogues were engaging, funny, emotional. Coming from the MCU, I was sceptical that the voice acting won't feel natural to me, but I was really pleasantly surprised. They did an amazing job and I got used to their voices so quickly. They got them all right...

The game takes place in the Marvel Universe and features a variety of iconic characters such as Wolverine, Captain America, and Iron Man. Players control the customisable character, The Hunter, and work alongside the Midnight Suns team to prevent Lilith, the Mother of Demons, from bringing about the end of the world.

One of the strengths of the game is its immersive and well-crafted story. The game's narrative is captivating, and the characters are well-developed and intriguing. The game's cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and sound design all contribute to a polished and professional production.

The gameplay mechanics are also well-executed. The turn-based combat system is satisfying and rewards strategic thinking. Players can customize their character's abilities and playstyle to fit their preferences, and the game provides a satisfying challenge as the difficulty level ramps up.

The game's graphics are also impressive. The character designs are faithful to the source material and are rendered beautifully in the game's 3D graphics engine. The environments are detailed and immersive, and the game's visual effects are top-notch.

What I got was an amalgamation of tactical turn-based gameplay, strategy card game, and The Sims, with Marvel's fun characters and storytelling. It sounds odd, and it definitely is, but it works very well and creates a unique identity for itself and a game that is just fun. 

The story and dialogue is typical Marvel fare, high-quality and witty but cringeworthy at times (just embrace it, Captain America saying 'did someone order a knuckle sandwich?' repeatedly at a collection of spectral hounds from hell is funny if you let yourself believe it is), and the voice-acting is great. Character interactions were a high point of the narrative for me, and that plays a key part in the gameplay as well, since the relationship between the player character - the Hunter - and the other heroes is something that you can maintain and build, which provides lots of great dialogue as well as a myriad of bonuses when fighting with the heroes in question. Speaking of the Hunter, you get to create your own superhero and choose how they act to an extent, as well as decide whether their abilities are light or dark (two pretty different paths gameplay-wise) or a strange mix of the two. Lots of character customization is present which is a lot of fun to mess around with. The combat is fun and engaging and easy to keep fresh, and there are a lot of different difficulties with ramping rewards that you can change whenever you want, ranging from very easy to 'all of my heroes die within two turns and I can't do anything about it but cry a little,' meaning the game is always as hard as you want it to be.

You get a lot of content with the base game, it took me about 60 hours to beat the game, unlocking everything that I could along the way, and I am going to play at least part of new game+ for experimenting with different builds and achievement cleanup. Paid DLC coming out in the future promises to add quite a bit more content as well, which is cool.

I do have a complaint for the game, which is that it is currently pretty poorly optimized for PC. My PC can run the newest, most graphically impressive games on max settings, except for ray tracing, but it struggles with this one for some reason, and that seems to be an issue that is very common. Lag and stuttering is pretty common, which isn't game breaking because of turn-based combat, but it can be very annoying nonetheless. Also annoying are textures that fail to load in, either on character models or the environment, or on the ui, any of which require the game to restart, which is also quite annoying. This didn't ruin my experience, but it was a stain on an otherwise wonderful experience. The game is pretty new so hopefully they fix these issues, but it seems like they are focusing on pushing out DLC.

Overall, Midnight Suns is a very fun, varied, and unique experience that is fun and engaging, but suffers at times from distracting performance issues.

The truth is that it is surprisingly fun. Surprisingly not because it comes from Firaxis, who has a long history of success in the genre, but surprising because the writing, the visuals, in the gameplay are all of excellent quality – which no one really expected from a Marvel product at this point. In fact, I would have much preferred to see the plot of this game on the silver screen than the things we have for the last several years.

Speaking specifically of the tactical play, it is a departure from the standard square-and-move two phase tactics that XCOM itself introduced and games since have imitated. Instead movement and conflict is almost node-based with facing and blocking becoming more important to keep in mind than in many predecessors. Combined with the deck-building power-escalation gameplay, it set off at a different direction than many other tactics games.

Certainly on sale this is an absolute gem to pick up. By the Legendary edition, don't worry about skins or anything else, and just play. The DLC might actually have a more interesting plot in some ways than the core, but it doesn't matter.

Of course, as every review has to say to try and counter all the people that see ""Firaxis"" and ""I can see individuals"" then immediately conclude that this is some sort of XCOM clone, it really really isn't.  But then, those folks clearly aren't reading/watching any reviews anyway, so I won't linger on it.  They'll buy, they'll get mad, and they'll downvote the game because the game ""fooled them.""

By day, it's a card-based, turn-based strategy game.  I never played card-based before and found it to be really fun.  Yes, you certainly can get burned by the RNG giving you bad cards, but it's not much different than getting bad rolls when rolling to hit.  The nice thing about the system is that, once the card is in your hand, you (mostly) know exactly what it's going to do.  If it says it will do 115 damage, using it on an enemy with 116hp will not KO it while an enemy with 115hp will go down EVERY time.  That makes it possible to plan precisely for several moves!  Fun stuff!

By night, it's chit chatting with the superheroes.  I liked that, too, for the most part.  I don't know a whole lot about Marvel characters beyond the movies, so I learned a bit and even got to meet new characters.  It got me interested enough to even check out some character videos on YouTube.  The humor is fun, too.  With DLC, you'll have 15 heroes talking about how nice you're being, though, which gets really tiresome.

There's also an exploration game in here, at least for the first half or so.  That was... OK, I guess.  It's just exploring the grounds around your HQ, so it's not like you're going to have a big environmental variety, and the mysteries you find go from OK, to minimalistic, to ""why did you even bother?"" over the course of the first act of the game.  Then it's done, and you only go out to harvest loot and herbs from time to time.  I love exploring, so I'll even take a mediocre exploration mechanic, but I wish they had done more.

Oh, and there's a little puzzle game in here, too.  Once you get your friendship level up high enough, you can send that hero on a special solo mission that amounts to a puzzle for you to solve with that character's powers.

As I mentioned at the start, though, this isn't Firaxis' best effort.  The entire levelling system seems pointless to me.  Gaining a level makes your hero stronger, but the enemies get stronger by (as near as I can tell) just as much.  The ""gloss"" currency you use for cosmetics works great in the first part of the game, but once you have everyone dressed how you like, the currency becomes pointless.  There are several difficulty levels you can unlock, but a higher difficulty level just rewards you with more xp and gloss.  As I just said, those aren't very useful, so people playing harder difficulties for greater rewards won't be happy with the results.

I think the game itself is worth the full price, but $15 is far too much to ask for each DLC.  The prices get much more reasonable when on sale.  The DLC is designed so that you can add them in anytime.  They do all synergize together to form a complete story, so I would suggest getting the Legendary edition on sale.  Oddly, there doesn't seem to be any ""upgrade to Legendary"" bundle system on this game.  That's sad.  This game is pretty unique, so it would be great if players could buy the base game and then upgrade to Legendary if they find they like it.

The combat uses a card system where each character has their own deck of cards that you set. For each mission you get to bring 3 characters (although it'll always require a specific character) and then their decks get added to the main deck you'll have access to in the mission. At the start of each turn you'll randomly draw cards from the larger deck and have 3 card plays, 2 redraws, and 1 movement. For the most part the position of your character doesn't matter aside from knockback abilities, and you'll move either depending on which enemy you attacked with a card or if you use your 1 movement to manually reposition a character. So it's less about tactical positions, and more about what the most effective use of your cards is.

I'd say the core gamplay loop is a little similar to Mass Effect where you do a mission and then talk to your companions at your base. The game has a sort of ""friendship sim"" where the dialogue choices will either gain or lose friendship with different characters. The higher your friendship with a certain character, the better cards you can get for them. It also uses ""light"" and ""dark"" dialogue options in conversations which affect your character's light/dark balance, which then affects the types of cards you'll get for your character. This is not a good/evil thing and sometimes the light option increases friendship with some characters whereas with others the dark option is better. However, the friendship sim is actually more complex than that. For example if a character likes the light option, sometimes picking the light option will actually decrease your friendship depending on the context of the conversation. This is good and provides better roleplaying aspects than most RPG's out there. One thing to note is that the game is not designed to where you'll max friendship with every single character. I tried evenly distributing it and I ended up reaching level 5 friendship (the max) with one character, whereas most were at level 3 friendship, and some were at level 2 friendship.

The main downside is how long the Abbey sections take. After the mission you're at the Abbey where you talk to the characters as part of the story as well as upgrading your cards and getting new cards. In addition to story cutscenes, you'll also frequently have the ""hangout"" options where you choose a character to hangout with, which is where you'll have an extra cutscene with them to increase your friendship. All of it definitely has gameplay purposes instead of just being additional lore, but it still takes way too long to get back to the combat. The only one that's truly optional is the Abbey exploration where that will only give you additional lore and cosmetics. However, the Abbey sections don't feel like a waste of time because almost everything you do is used to help you in battle or upgrade your characters.

Another downside is the way the dlc is set up. You don't have to buy all the characters, but if you do then their stories intertwine a lot and you'll have a required mission for one character so that you can do a mission for another character. All the dlc characters are part of the same side story and there's a final mission where they all team up to take down the big bad. I don't think this final mission could even be played if you don't own all the dlc characters. So the way it's set up is that you need to buy all the characters at the same time or you'll miss out on some of their missions. The dlc characters do comment on the main story so it also feels like an incomplete experience without the dlc. However, they become much less involved once the dlc story finishes.

Character interactions and relationships with your custom character are mostly spot on with how they act in the comics and the paranormal angle of the story really feels like treading new ground as of late. You develop genuine attachment to or dislike for their personalities based on how they act. It is unfortunate they did not include romance options but it doesn't take away from the story and can survive without it.

Superb gameplay. Loved the story and the characters as well as the ""Abbey"" stuff.

It's a pretty niche game though, especially with the Abbey and its many RPG elements. It's the kind of thing that you'll either hate, or absolutely love. If you hate it, you'll most likely find it to be ""draggy"" and tedious. But if you like that kind of stuff like me, you'll most likely find yourselves fully invested in the characters and the Abbey Grounds lore, and love every single development of it. The characterisation of the Marvel characters are also pretty spot on compared to the source materials. Had my doubts about the arena missions and the card-based gameplay, but now that I've finished the game, I honestly prefer it to the percentage-based gameplay in XCOM. The gameplay is far more complex than you might think at first. It's super satisfying no matter which difficulty you're playing it at.

That being said, it's not a perfect game as of this review. The most recent update seems to have had a negative impact on performance along with some minor bugs. Nothing game breaking, but can be mildly annoying. NG+ is also somewhat underwhelming with only very little carrying over. Then there's the 2K launcher, which is just... yeah.

All in all, if you're into this type of niche game that blends XCOM-like Turn-Based Strategy with almost dating sim(ish) RPG elements in a Marvel universe, you'll love it.

Here's hoping Firaxis will do a WOTC-like story DLC for it.

A demon queen has been resurrected, and the only person who can stop them, is their child. Marvel heroes band together around this new character, Hunter, who can customize to your heart's content, while attempting to thwart these demonic forces. In doing so, you'll recruit new heroes, upgrade their abilities and befriend them in a system not too dissimilar from something like Three Houses: give them gifts and favorable dialogue options and unlock new bonuses with them in combat. And no, you can't marry Blade, I tried.

The meat of this game is the combat. You take any combo of three heroes into battle. Each hero has their own deck of cards that combine to form what you draw from, and here's where the real systems kick in. Each hero has a unique mechanic, something that thematically ties their cards together. Blade does Bleed and then has effects from hitting Bleeding enemies. Nico has random effects, which makes her tricky to play but with big pay-offs. Spider-Man is all about mobility and dealing damage with the environment. And each card can be upgraded, customized and tweaked, so each hero plays exactly how you want them to.

The story is standard comic book fare. I told people that whether or not they enjoyed the game likely hinged on how interesting the phrase ""Book Club with Blade and Captains Marvel and America"" sounds. And the response you had to that sentence is likely the response you'll have to the game as whole. It doesn't do anything to NOT be a comic book story, but as someone familiar with comic books, it's an alright one of those.

I haven't followed Marvel comic storylines for decades but this is a real gem which deserved better.  The VO and story were doing pretty darn well and kept me engaged and playing through missions.

I have only 4 complaints.
1) Only one mission a day?  BORING!  I want to grind things out and not have to go through a whole day per mission.  You should have been able to assemble teams and send each team out on their own mission per day rather than 95% of the roster sitting idle each day.

2) I am not sure I like this new trend toward adding a card aspect to everything but it works well enough but I like my games to be more skill based.  Having a random card draw just adds randomness which can screw you regardless of skill.

3) I think they might have been improved the DLCs by adding more story content 

4) Please, for the love of god, make DLCs standalone AND integrated into the storyline (if you must).  I have too many games to replay a bunch of them so making it to where you had to basically start a new game to get the full experience every DLC was a bummer.

I bought this at full price and got the Legendary Edition with all the extra costumes but I would say to wait till it's at least 25% - 50% off if you are going to purchase.

You spend A LOT of time talking to Marvel heroes (65,000 lines of dialogue!) with voice acting that matches perfectly to each character. But I argue that the conversations are quintessential Marvel comic book writing, with the perfect polish of camp and heart. This game feels like it's an authentic part of the Marvel universe. But just like some of the best Marvel stories, don't take it as seriously as the gospel. It's entertainment; be entertained!
From a strategic perspective, it's not as intense and unforgiving as the XCOM games by the same studio; it's not as card dependent as a CCG, nor as dramatic as The Last of Us or Red Dead Redemption 2. <i>But crucially, it's downright fun!</i>

A shame it won't have a sequel due to bad sales.

Highly recomend it if you're into turn based games and strategy.
A bonus if you like superheroes.

I'm not much into card games and was kind of dubious on picking this up, but it was very addicting and a joy to play. 
A spectacular mix from Xcom way of play, but with cards, and RPG elements in the mix to keep you entertained, as well as some ""base"" management, like Research and Upgrades.

Strategy:
The mix of cards and Xcom is beautifully done, always kept me interested in going to another fight, try new heroes, new combinations...
And with such an extended group of characters I was afraid I was going to drag through some fights with some of them when mandated by story, but they all have great options and skills, so even if you don't like them/level them, they can still do their part in a fight when you're forced to pick them.

RPG:
As a Marvel fan I was very surprised that the dialogues and characters are so entertaining to talk and listen to.
Both their physical depictions, their wardrobe style, the way they talk and react to you... very nicely done, you really feel a difference when talking with Captain America or Wolverine.

I was always eager to hang out with them in the off time and level up their friendships, very worthwhile, even after they are maxed.

The characters are so good that I even started liking Captain Marvel and Mobius, characters that, when I met them, I thought I was going to drop them asap, but they ended up not only fun to talk to, but also very entertaining to play with.

The bad stuff:
- People complain about need for grind: personally, didn't feel I needed to farm or grind.
I understand the complaint, if you do want the best stuff, like cards and upgrades, some farming is required. But I didn't feel it was too much.

Sometimes I felt I did need to get a specific mission to get an item, but general missions are so fun and get so many options, that I ended up doing more than 1 general mission between story mission just because I wanted to try heroes, combinations or unlock research.

- Dragging time
There are a lot of cutscenes, the ""loading"" between mission does seem like padding,
You basically get a 5~ second scene that you can skip and make it last 2~ seconds. It does get boring.

- FPS
Never crashed but it does break/lag, FPS wise, in some large cinematic battles.

Overall:
Very underrated game, worth a try.

At first it does seem like an XCOM-like game.  So the comparisons are inevitable, and by comparison, it sucks.  Supporting graphics are nice, but the gameplay system is essentially a small rectangular area.  Positioning does not really affect gameplay other than by a few examples of AoE abilities and by common objects scattered around that can be used to deal damage.

But the gameplay is basically fun, and the reason is that this is not at all an XCOM game, it is a PvE card game with supporting animations.  Progression comes by unlocking new heroes, and new cards and upgrades for those heroes.  The gameplay is simple enough to be fun for a casual blast through, but has enough depth that it can be challenging if you ramp up the difficulty.

This only makes up 50% of the game.  The other half is essentially a friendship and exploration simulator where you get to hang out with the Avengers and some brash young kids.  The voice acting is basically excellent and brings life to these characters, and most of the jokes land well.  The main character has an amusingly Keanu Reeves-style deadpan delivery, but perhaps this was done intentionally to allow you to inject the personality that you want, so that you can feel part of the events and not merely feel like an observer.  The Abbey is very beautiful - even on my low-spec PC, the grounds are gorgeously illuminated both a day and nighttime - and you can explore it at your own pace.  It is a real joy to find new areas, and you can even take snapshots on a drone camera if you wish.

- The combat / card turn based tactics is really cool. There are about 6 or 7 mission ""types"" and even doing the same mission type - you get different heroes, different enemies so the missions don't feel repetitive even though I have a ton of hours in the game.
- I like the alternation between - combat - then you chat with the heroes and upgrade things - then back to combat - it helps break up the action in a good way.
- The heroes behave like I would expect them to behave. The writing is really well done from the perspective of the heroes being how I expect them to be. Loved that.

The Cons - all of these are really minor nitpicks:
- I don't like wandering around the Abbey grounds picking flowers - it takes a lot of time and you sort of have to do it. (You don't really have to do it - thus it being a minor nitpick) but I wish it was a little less grindy here.
- I wish you had more options to make your character look different. Like - different body styles for example. I am not big into the cosmetics - so I have no spent much ""gloss"" on unlocking everything - I kind of like the default look every one has the best already. (mostly)
- Sometimes it is difficult to tell if you can hit an enemy with a environmental - but again this is really minor.

Love the game - the very ending after the credits hinted at a sequel and I hope they make one. :)",1700181864,1700181864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like card games and Marvel, this game is for you. The main story is very engaging, but the season pass missions with the ""Tomb of Dracula"" finale are very exciting. Very good graphics, many iconic characters and well-thought-out decisions regarding comic book references. I should also mention the map, because the Abbey contains many secrets and in the evenings after a mission I like to discover new parts of the map and solve Agatha's puzzles.
The disadvantages are that sometimes you have to be very observant, the game contains errors, and after completing the main and side storylines, the game becomes boring and monotonous. Moreover, the game does not reward players who maxed out everything before the final mission, because we get all the midnight suns suits for this mission. Photo mode, especially during daily sparring, should have a rotating lens to adjust for a better photo. Research at the beginning is a very good decision by the creators, but if after the final mission you still have something that requires you to complete a hero mission with this character, you cannot fully upgrade the abbey.
I give the game 8/10. It's a really good card game with Marvel characters. You can do a speedrun and complete it in 35 hours, but you can instead learn to get better at it to gradually increase the difficulty level (which is also a very good decision by the developers - there are many levels of difficulty).

Not having speed up animations option and repetitive animations that take 10-15 sec to complete, and mini-game introductions that take almost 1 min each time that can't be skipped sucks too.

In watching any of the trailers for the game, you get the impression this thing is fast paced, action packed, crazy awesome attack animations, etc. It has all that...sorta. They are the same moves every time, and you might repeat those same moves 20 times in an encounter. For me, the game started off looking freaking awesome. I loved how it was like watching an episode of a film series for the cut-scenes. I kinda wish they just took it in that direction. For me, every aspect of the game was an afterthought. You play day by day (in game days), and each day you get up, chose a team mate to spar with (you don't actually see any fights, just a comic style photo), chose a solo mission for a team mate, talk to anyone you can, do a mission, come back and ""chill"" with a team mate, sleep, rinse and repeat. Oh and the team mates ask these awkward ""how should I handle this scenario?"" questions that they as seasoned fighters would not really be asking. You also have to cozy up to your team mates, which was the most cringe thing about the game to me. It's incredibly scripted and cliche. They also over emphasize the polarity of everyone's attitudes, making everyone insanely 1D as characters. Between missions, when you are chilling at the abby, on an island that only one person can teleport anyone out of (seems like a really dumb idea in case she dies and everyone is just trapped there forever), they want you to explore the grounds/island. You assume the 3rd person POV for your character and try to explore around. The controls of it are clunky and you can't even jump, so a pebble on the path can stop you mid-run. Also the map controls are just terrible. You can't use the mouse to just drag it or pan, you have to use WASD and it just overshoots everything. While they want you to explore the island and perform some sort of side project for a dead lady, you're told it's not required for the main campaign, which I guess is nice but also adds to the whole ""everything is an afterthought"" vibe I kept getting. You get the game thinking your gunna be in combat most (at least half) of it, but nope, you gotta go help Nico set up a surprise birthday party and talk up your team mates to deepen your bonds with them, otherwise you can't upgrade them as well as you otherwise would. They also have an annoying loot-box aspect (why am I not surprised since so many games are doing this) reward from missions to get things for upgrading your cards. That alone is a mega turn-off. Also, the card aspect of the combat is just really not cutting it for me. I get that a lot of people seem to like it, and to each his own. View my review as a lamentation that I didn't watch a streamer playing it first so I knew that combat was a fraction of what the game's about. If I compared to mass effect series, I loved those games! They did a great job with the writing, and those characters really had some chemistry somehow, so by the 3rd game you really knew you'd miss them when it was over (after all the DLC was completed at least). So I do like the idea of bonding with your team, but the way it's done in this game is just so cringe (again, to me). I really wish I could refund, but there's no way to get a feel for how the game is going to be in only 2 hours. It took me about 4-5, and I kept going in the vain hope it'd get better. 

If you do wanna get this game, I just suggest watching a streamer for a few hours and you'll see what I mean. Maybe you'll like it, in which case absolutely support the company.

Why am I ""combining cards"" to make them more powerful, why isn't that a natural part of a leveling system? It's overly complicated in stupid ways that lead me to believe the intention was to be able to purchase card packs for real money. 

And as an aside, I am so over Matt Mercer.

P.S.
I played some more time and made the call to submit for a refund. Here's my overall reasons:

- The card battle system is great, but the card leveling part of it is overly complex and plays like a $5 mobile app game, not a major title.
- I checked and aside from DLC, out of 13 playable characters there's only 4 in the game that I actually care about, Nico, Ghost Rider, Hulk, & Wolverine.
- Absolutely unnecessary exploration to find essences and unlock cosmetics. Why does this even exist? It seems to be just a time burner. Let me unlock these things through missions.
- The dialogue reads like everyone is Tony Stark in disguise and I hate it. Everyone has his same arrogance, the same snark, and it made me not want to develop relationships with any of them.
- Micro-transations... f*cking micro-transactions. As stated above, this feels like a mobile app game.",1699575190,1699638906,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Midnight Suns hit a spot where xcom couldn't for me. I know everyone loves that game but I couldn't get into it, and I gave Midnight Suns a try thinking I wouldn't be bought into it and would probably refund. I say that, but it captured everything I would want out of a Marvel game so far.

Friendship (maybe romantic) elements where you get to learn more about characters you're unfamiliar with. I never cared to learn more about Magik and suddenly I am now obsessed with her. I got to learn about Blade and found out he's not my cup of tea.

The biggest draw is you get to make a character. yes, the creation elements are limited but you can still project this idea of a character onto them and play a path how you want. I'm very impressed, and I'm enjoying myself with designing, building relationships, and the combat is something I don't think is an annoying grind.

The best thing is the combat, its incredibly fun, incredibly diverse and the card mechanic really shines in making it feel continuously fresh!

The story as well is a major bonus point, but sadly both the story and the combat are dragged down by the ""Mobile Game"" Mechanics the game uses. Im 100% convinced that the original intention was to put it chock full of MTX, this can be seen by the fact that you open Gamma Coils, which open like your typical loot box and you only get one per mission played, you also open Artifacts the same way, Artifacts also level up your Research level and provide 5 different resources need to upgrade and create cards.

This screams ""Mobile Game"" and ""MTX""... Another awful part is that every Story mission requires you to complete a randomized mission first before you can proceed with the story, this really drags out the game and slows down the story. The nearly endless talks and club activities, while sometimes fun, are mostly incredibly repetetive and full of empty words and phrases with no meaning.

Lastly the Abbey can be explored, similar to adventure games you slowly get new abilities to open new ways and find new information and chests, the problem here is a.) you can explore 100% of the Abbey within like 10h of playing and then are still left with like 20-30h of story content where the Abbey just sits around and b.) most of the stuff you find is pointless anyway.

Midnight Suns is a deckbuilding turn based strategy game that borrows from XCOM style Squad based combat but uses cards for actions and abilities and uses a class system based off the holy trinity of tank, damage, and support. Out of combat, you will be talking to your companions in a visual novel-esque way in your hub, trying to earn higher friendship with them, learning about their backstories, do chores for them, etc to get special items and experience. Some people didn't really like the hub content because they wanted a raw strategy game but that's kind of the point of this game. Although, the game's steam description could do a better job of explaining that to people also. I very much enjoyed the hybrid nature of this game. It helps it stand out in a sea of same-y games.

Pros
-Easy to learn hard to master game play.
-Very fun game loop of Story quest, talk to the characters about life and stuff, do a side mission for loot, and then continue the story
-*Mostly* pretty balanced and allows for multiple play styles.
-Interesting characters, some have better interpretations of these heroes than their MCU and recent comic run counterparts that's for sure.
-A pretty interesting story too. There's legitimate, meaningful conflict that you can weigh in on as the main character. There's moments of actual ambiguity and complexity, and it never feels like a generic ""good/bad morality"" system. Not every hero likes talking to a goody two shoes boy/girl scout who follows all the rules. Heroes also have contradictory desires, so you can't please everyone. It also really feels like you're a team leader who needs to get to know their teammates in order to keep the peace. (Although, there's not much you can do to mess it up. You can't get anyone killed and everyone is still accessible if someone doesn't like you)

Cons
-Very buggy and prone to crashing (it's gotten better but still an issue)
-The combat is pretty good but definitely caps out on complexity after a certain point. It's a much simpler game than XCOM and other deckbuilders.
-Can feel grindy at higher difficulties. You can't beat certain levels without leveling up your heroes and getting the right cards.
-Some heroes are totally useless or are outmatched by other heroes who fulfill the same role. that can suck if you are a fan of one hero's comics and you want to play them at higher difficulties.
-The game assumes you like comic books and are familiar with these characters and so will not explain their backstories fully and the history characters have with each other to you.

Overall
Buy on sale. I got the game with the season pass for about $45 earlier in the year and I feel like it was worth. I still come back to this game every so often just like Xcom. This game is definitely not worth $100 for the legendary edition. I checked Nexus and there's a lot of mods for this game too. There isn't a lot of game play changing mods but there's cool skins, hero rebalances (which could fix the main issue I have with this game), and a few other things.",1699359262,1699359373,True,0,0,0.492610841989517212,0,True,False,False

Frankly even there I would say it differs.  MS is as much Adventure game as it is Strategy game.  Also the combat is throw all the characters into a small field and play cards, nothing like X-COM.

If you like Marvel and always wanted to meet the characters you should love this game as it literally has hours of dialog (I've never seen a game with so much non-repeating dialog and animated segments).  A large part of the game is building friendships with the heros and hanging out with them discussing their issues/lives.   All of it is very well done and the closest you are going to get to meeting and going for a swim/fishing with Nico/Spiderman/Deadpool/etc. you are likely the find.  The story line is long and very Marvel like with endless goons to crush with Super Villains thrown in to keep it fresh.

If you are someone who hates Adventure games, story quests and not a Marvel fan you probably won't like it, as it moves very slow if you are just looking for combat.  A typical day is like:
1) search for glowies in Abbey
2) check email
3) respond to email by having discussions with whomever contacted you
4) travel around abbey talking to all the people who want to speak to you and may ask for something
5) hang out with anyone available if you want to earn friendship.
6) pet the dog (you must do this every day)
7) optionally you can explore the grounds which may lead to more encounters or discussions.
8) go to Forge to receive upgrades to Research, Cards and Items based on what you did yesterday
9) go to training yard
     a) spar for various benefits
     b) upgrade cards
     c) heal characters
     d) upgrade yard
10) go to CENTRAL and set up missions that run without you
11) go to mirror room and finally get a mission
12) set up battle deck if you have card/item upgrades
13) fight your mission
14) return to abbey
15) search abbey for glowies (yes again)
16) talk to everyone who wants to speak with you
17) hang out with anyone available that you wish to 
18) turn in common item for an arcane key you can use to open chest
19) purchase gifts to give heros to generate more friendship

And this is just the stuff you need to do every day,  there are tons of optional stuff like every character has multiple outfits to choose from and you can dress up your own character, decorate your room change the paintings that are up...  Also remember at each character interaction with take 5-10 minutes and you will have multiple of them each time you enter the Abbey and none of it is text it is all played out on the screen.  You are there in the middle of arguments between Dr Strange and Tony Stark and such and you always have choices as to how you respond and they effect the game. 

So yes I can see how someone who liked X-COM which was just combat and nothing else would seriously dislike this game, I'm a big Marvel fan myself and while listening to Dr Strange can get on your nerves after a while.  That is actually the point.  Spiderman and Deadpool are annoying, you can't help but like Steve Rogers, Nico lacks confidence and Magik is well Magik.  Insanely cool if you know them from comics, not so much I suppose otherwise.

In Combat all characters use completely different attacks and moves.  Sparring together opens combo moves between heros that are very cool.  Most characters have special rules that apply just to them like Ms Marvel turning into Binary.  Matching character abilities together to get the best results is a big task.  Don't go to a web site experiment yourself or you are cheating yourself of some of the best fun in the game.

Lots of replayability if you can live through the dialog over and over again LOL.  This is one game no one will be finishing in 30 minutes.

This is like a Marvel Mini-Series with combat.  It even has a difficulty mode to allow you to play where the combat cant be lost if you just want to follow the story.  Crazy good fun.

I really enjoyed both the social sim and tactical combat elements, and the loop going back and forth kept me going for hours at a time. This is a AAA title that I actually feel could be worth the money. I'm tempted to just get all the DLC content thru the season pass even off-sale.

With how much they throw at you at the start, I was definitely a bit skeptical that they would be able to deliver on their scope, but fortunately one of the most tedious aspects (the Abbey exploration, while kinda neat, really just throws you in the deep end sometimes) is completely optional. And if you *really* hate the social sim elements that much, you can skip a good chunk of that as well. The enter key is your friend, guys.

If I had one thing I would change, it would definitely be the artificial break between story missions. It's absolutely the biggest hamper to the pacing as you'll be really into what's going on with the plot, and then that all screeches to a halt until you complete another random side mission. You could've solved this with a better progression system that punishes players who charge too far ahead and too underlevelled, naturally introducing a need for the side missions to improve your cards and your power.

There is a good strategy game at the core of Midnight Suns. There's just so much that gets in the way of it that it's hard to justify the amount of time it takes from you. I enjoyed the Abbey banter more than most of the reviews here did, but after the first few hours you start to notice that there's much less of it than you'd think. The grind to unlock facilities and proper decks for your characters is so mind numbing that even installing 20 'speed the game up' mods wasn't enough to get me over the hump.

There was some ambition here, and I have to respect that. But in trying to make this game more expansive they just ended up diluting the good parts too hard. The horrific loading times are a sign that the game can't keep up with its own lofty goals, too. And WHY can't we speed up the same combat animations we've seen hundreds and hundreds of times already?

Maybe if they'd cut it down to the base Midnight Suns roster, perhaps one A-list hero like Doctor Strange as an outsider, that would have helped to ease the feature creep somewhat.

I didn't even learn about it until a month or two ago and was surprised that it had already been out for a while. Exploring the area around the abbey was interesting. I particularly enjoyed discovering the spooky old church and the old graveyard. I have explored abandoned areas in real life and found this experience to be quite satisfying.

I really enjoyed all the different costumes for the characters. It took me a while but I finally unlocked all of them. The missions were fun, but kind of repetitive, although that happens with games like this so I have come to expect it.

The dialogue between the characters was kind of bizarre at times. The main character almost becomes like a therapist to the others. In all the games I have played over the years (have been playing them since the 80's), I have never heard as much whining and complaining from the characters in a game about their problems.  I think it reflects how society has been changing over the years with people being more likely to want to discuss their problems with others than they used to. I found it a little weird in a video game. Constantly listening to their emotional baggage was taxing and actually distracted me from saving the world.

While there weren't any romance options, for a while there I thought the main character was going to be doing the excitement with both the Scarlet Witch and Captain Marvel. Things seemed to be moving in that direction very quickly, then suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Another thing I found odd was that Captain Marvel is supposed to be carrying on  a romance with Blade, but she is constantly talking about taking me to see remote star systems and toward the end of the game, suggests we go to Deneb-7 to party - just the two of us! And this is right after Blade tells you he is planning to marry her! Maybe there should be a sequel where you compete with blade to win the hand of Captain Marvel? Then after your honeymoon on Deneb-7, you help her fight the Skrulls? Something to think about!

The graphics were excellent and I thought the available cards were pretty effective for the most part. I didn't experience any major bugs in the game. The game did seem to slow down a bit when I had a lot of saved games, although there is a limit to the number you can have. Several times I thought I had encountered a bug when book club and garage meetings weren't progressing , but I eventually realized that some events in the game had to be triggered in order for those things to progress.

Overall, as a fan of comic books from back in the day, I thought this game was fun and would highly recommend it. Compared with most of the other junk out there I was pleasantly surprised.",1699202248,1699202248,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""painful"" doesn't really quite cover the ideas I had about this one, but I kept hearing good things. then great things. and then it was on sale for -60%. and then I saw it was from the same people who gave us X-Com 2. and besides, I could always refund it (if the story ever stopped taking up valuable minutes).

and then it started and my eyes were rolling so much with the Witty Marvel Banter. and the tactics seemed sub-X-Com in every way. but then it kept going, and what do you know -- I actually started to like these characters. Captain Marvel is nothing at all like her movie's depiction, thank all the Greek gods. and Tony Snark, while definitely RDJ-infused is a lot less cringe as I worried he'd be. (all the voice actors deserve praise, but the Iron Man voice acting is quite an accomplishment; it's an RDJ impression in inflections and tone, but also something else all at once.)

and if I miss the RNG percentage tactics of X-Com, that's fine. I Have X-Com for that. this game can play more like ""Into the Breach"" than X-Com - you're almost always aware of what your enemies are going to do, so you react both their plans and your own. it's satisfying. it's light. there's social dynamics going on; like a really pared-down ""Baldur's Gate 3"" or something. it's good stuff. 

what can I say? I was dead wrong on this one. all those ideas I thought hateful and cliche and boring just aren't. it's a good game, and definitely worth the massive sale prices it's usually up for.

The gameplay is really good, and more then that, it's one of the most innovative tactics games I've played in a while. The deckbuilder mechanics add a really unique flow to the combat, and as much as I don't like the superhero theme personally, I have to admit that a cast of mostly familiar characters with distinct powers works really well with this system. Everyone has a unique gameplay identity, and combined with the similarly distinct enemy types, this makes for a lot of variety if you bother to swap your characters around. (And you should try to keep everyone evenly leveled because the game will sometimes force you to use certain characters.) If you're familiar with deckbuilder games, you know how satisfying it feels to pull off long combos by managing your resources well, and this aspect is also present here, while still being easily approachable. There is a big focus on positioning and knocking enemies around too. You unlock difficulties as you go along and can swap up or down when you feel like it. The difference between the highest and lowest difficulty is huge and there are a lot of steps inbetween, so whatever your preference is, you'll be able to find your sweetspot. Before I played this game myself I would joke about Firaxis being dragged into the MCU content mines but from a game design perspective, this is more interesting then another XCOM game would have been so maybe it's good that they got to do something else for a while to try out new things? Maybe?? It's not like I play XCOM for the plot or characters which bring me to...

...the writing. Let's just say that if you don't like capes this isn't going to change your mind. The main story tries and parts of it are a functional, if standard, urban fantasy narrative but unfortunately everyone is a sarcastic shithead. It seems like a common opinion that people don't like the teenage b-listers but the truth is that everyone talks like an annoying snarky teenager. Adult Man Tony Stark is the worst offender here but even Blade, the one character I really wanted to like, doesn't get by without making unfunny jabs at Twilight. There are some nice moments here and there but you'll have to listen to a lot of groanworthy MCU-style dialogue inbetween. Personally I found it worth sitting through for the gameplay, but this is a full priced game with a 50€ season pass. I don't have any of the dlc so I can't comment on the quality, but that's 110€ without discounts if you plan on getting everything and that makes me less inclined to look past annoyances like this. I'm willing to ignore a lot of bad or uninteresting writing in video games, but the characters here are often actively annoying and the hub area activities are a key selling point that just fell completely flat for me. I got the game on sale and didn't expect to like the writing, so I wasn't disappointed, and not everyone is as annoyed by this writing style as I am, but like I said at the top, I'm writing this review for people who are in the same camp as me. Everyone's mileage is going to vary for how much the character writing matters, but the gameplay is genuinely really good. If you're willing to give it a shot, go for it, if nothing else the gameplay is at least unique and interesting, just maybe pick it up on sale if you're buying it purely for the fights and not for the opportunity to hang out with Wolverine",1699088433,1699088433,True,1,0,0.51316678524017334,0,True,False,False

The core combat game play seems pretty fun, however, even after two hours I can only say ""seems"" because there are so many cut scenes and other dialogue that I feel like I barely got to play the game at all. Even in the combat, every time you play a card, there is an animation of your character's move that seems like it would get old pretty quickly. 

Overall, I think if you really like Marvel, and you are willing to go for a slower-paced experience with lots of story/narration in between actual game play, this could be a good game for you. Looking at other reviews, people seem pretty divided about the writing of this game. For what it's worth, from my short experience, I thought the writing was okay, serviceable - I think there's a bit of hyperbole in some of the things people are saying about the writing.

of my time so far, maybe 60% mashing esc to get past endless cutscenes and get back to the part with some actual gameplay, 30% wandering around a janky third person walking simulator, mindlessly following blips on the HUD that lead to more endless dead-eyed cutscenes, and maybe 10% quite fun combat when the game finally decides you have done enough faffing about to allow you in. But once in combat you can't have a camera that shows you any real percentage of the arena, or that adjusts itself to try and fit both character and the only remaining POI on the screen at once, or that allows you to see how your 1 move per turn is going to affect lines of fire for all the debris special actions etc.

Oh and then there is the immediate on-release season 1 DLC on a £50 game! Want to pay £12 per new character, come on in!

Can't say how disappointed i am that this was what 2k and firaxis were doing with their time instead of Xcom 3.

Recommended if you want more marvel lore delivered unendingly at you in order to earn the right to actually play the game for brief periods of time.

I only played the tutorial section but based on this and the many reports of bugg that remain unfixed I decided to refund.

Let's begin with the best: The game mix of XCOM strategy, RPG elements and card playing/ collecting is fun and clearly the star of the show. Heroes will level, get stronger, and most importantly get better cards. Each character does feel unique and each convinces with its own background story and emotions/ motivations. The battle mechanic (manage heroism for each turn) is challenging, but yet the game is easier compered for exampel with XCOM. In and out of battles you will earn many different types of materials, artifacts, credits, etc. and soon you find yourself in a very addictive ""collect and spend immediately""-mechanic. Fun! Tbh, sometimes it can be a pain to keep the ressources all straight and navigating the menus, manage all of them back and forth just to upgrade/ get new cards. Here I would have liked a simpler or faster system. But the possibility to customize all characters was great and gives a lot of variation. Creating your own personal ""superhero dream team"" felt fabulous and also offered a lot of variety as there are many different characters from the Marvel universe to play.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Marvel’s Midnight Suns combines addictive, deep strategy gameplay with a cast of characters that make the moments outside of the action just as rich and enjoyable as those in it. A lengthy campaign packed with missions to go on and relationships to form with Earth's Mightiest Heroes make Marvel's Midnights Suns a modern strategy classic and one of my biggest gaming surprises this year.

The gameplay loop consists of three phases: grabbing upgrades and improving your friendships with the other heroes in the morning, then running a mission, and then triggering an event in the evening with one or multiple heroes.

The missions are where the card game comes into play. The goal is typically to either eliminate all enemies or one beefy target by playing your cards smartly and making good use of the environmental interactions (mainly pushing enemies into things). It's a lot of fun, with many ways to manipulate the action economy and every hero feeling very strong without compromising the challenge.

There is also an optional, but recommended, exploration side to the game: you can run around the abbey grounds and unlock chests for cosmetics while learning the backstory of the abbey and its residents. It's a bit of a shame no card-based mini-games or puzzles were included there, it feels like a missed opportunity.

As for the story, it's... fine? I find the writing rather juvenile, but I'm having a good time watching the characters interact. I suspect that fans of the comics will enjoy the world-building a fair bit more. All the dialogue, which is most of the text, is very well voice-acted, although the characters' faces are unfortunately low-res (a couple of the heroes look like absolute goons at the abbey).

While a lot of people have apparently run into pretty bad technical issues, I have not ran into a single one except for massive frame drops in the very last battle.",1670337024,1697858657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, the description of the game is a bit misleading. When I initially went over the blurb I thought it was a gothic horror game about dungeoncrawling the Abbey! It's actually a pretty lighthearted romp.
Second, the game draws heavily on the Marvel Cinematic Universe aesthetic, which means lots of irreverent chattering and a lot of emphasis on ""heroes as people"", with Mass Effect-esque teambuilding and conversation - I like that, but it's definitely not for everyone, and that seems to be the focus of a lot of complaints I've seen.
Third, the game is actually fairly short. My playtime comes after maxing out friendship levels with characters, getting my decks to a point where I was happy to go to NG+, thoroughly exploring the Abbey grounds, and so on - but I play games slowly.

It's an interesting attempt at merging Marvel superheroes, RPG elements, and strategy that utterly fails in every aspect. There are several promising features or elements that are dampened by Marvel’s current attempt at witty dialogue and inability to touch upon mature elements. Also, by the card system in place.

The DLC isn’t worth it either, while their story is more condensed, it still feels very contrived. And half of the characters have abilities that suck (Bleed, and kill count, which goes down if they are hit).

[b]Music: [/b] 6/10

The music is fine for the most part, though unlikely to be memorable or remembered after a while. Sound effects work just as intended and deliver the cues you need. Voice acting ranges a lot from good to bad to annoying. However, that is also the story’s fault and forced humor.

[b]Visuals: [/b] 8/10

The game looks superb regarding the superheroes, villains, and visual effects. However, most of the enemies are copy-pastes of one another, and don’t stand out, which applies to the world where you find yourself too. 

[b]Gameplay: [/b] 2/10

The game seems and is interesting for the first few hours, after that, it just becomes a slog with half-assed features and poorly implemented design choices. Fights are restricted to small rooms (with technically infinite enemy reinforcements) that offer no challenge outside of seeing which cards you receive each round. Since you draw cards from a random pool each turn, you might have a decent hand (counting redraws or cards that allow you to draw more) or shit hands where cards cost heroism and you may not have it.

Before finishing Act 2, I had already seen all enemies thrown by the game, and there was nothing they added or change in the game. In fact, and this was simply moronic, at a certain point there is a cutscene where the characters find themselves fighting a new “enemy” and act preoccupied. An enemy you’ve been killing for several hours already. 

The card system seems interesting at the start, however, after a while you realize that A) there is little variety, B) a lot of cards are useless (looking here at any card that causes Bleed or requires Bleed for their full effect), C) upgrade path of cards is simply linear and offers nothing else and, D) Mods might as well not exist.

Now, before going into the abbey. Back at the missions, there is also no variety. While XCOM had a similar issue regarding objectives, the difference was that the maps were huge compared to the ones here, and that even a simply enemy could prove fatal if handled poorly. Here, there are no risks to getting hurt, outside of being unable to use a hero for a couple of missions if wounded too much. 

Back to the abbey. You have a huge map that has mysteries (which is an insult calling them like that) and that don’t add anything to the game. You have collectibles and resources, that outside of forced interactions with a few teammates aren’t required. You also unlock havens, and new locations which can help improve your standing with your team and gain bonuses.

The issue here is that you can find everything, unlock everything, and increase levels (because they have a friendship level, research level, spell level, etc) by midpoint of the game. Also, that most of the things you do, don’t offer much at all, except to waste your time. Since most of the rewards are purely cosmetic.

The only actual purpose would be to increase your relationship with certain characters to gain bonuses. What is the issue here, first, if the Hunter isn’t on a mission, then those superheroes won’t gain zit regarding their relationship. Second, you can’t hang out with your superheroes every night, meaning there are wasted nights. Third, the major boosters to relationship level, are only available once per game. And fourth, you can buy gifts to help boost this, however, you can’t just give them the gifts, you need to hang out with them, which goes back to the second issue. 

[b]Story: [/b] 2/10

The story begins great, interesting, and seems that it will be quite a ride. After 10 15 hours, I realized this was not going to be the case. One of the biggest issues regarding the story is the main character, the Hunter, they are simply Mary/Marty Sue’s with a voice which are forced to you and have little variety. Instead of giving us someone highly customizable, there’s only so much to do. And worse, instead of having your superheroes work together and acknowledge their difficulties, they only grow regarding the hunter.

This is more egregious when you solve their issues or help them notice something, only for them to backtrack at the next cutscene or go back to fighting as if you hadn’t just worked things out. 
The story was predictable from the very first dream, and it can boil down to Poor communication kills. It’s amazing the amount of characters that hide information just because and complicate things.

Further on, after a while, even when things are serious, the whole team is joking around as if it were a sitcom, having petty fights, and depending on your characters as if they were truly showing the characteristics of a leader or trusting person.

You are The Hunter, a reborn hero who gets to live in the Abbey, together with a lot of Marvel heroes. You also get to save several of them from the hands of the villains. From the Abbey, you go in missions, kinda like XCOM, some of them being scripted for the story and others being random, to save civilians, steal provisions or destroy some objectives. 

And now for the real gem of this game: combat. The combat is one of the best designed mechanics in any game that I've played in all my life. It's made with cards. Lame, isn't it? Not so. The cards are in fact abilities, with them you build all the characters and form decks that can and it's better to form combos inside the deck and with other characters'. For example Deadpool can apply Bleed status to enemies and Blade can wipe them out after that, cause a lot of his cards do much bigger damage to bleeding enemies. Also the  heroes can push others in all kind of objects and it's very satisfying to see the enemies explode or hit each other. The random factor of drawing cards only improves the experience IMO. You must always think what are the best moves for your heroes, so the combat is very tactical. It's also spectacular and cinematic. Spiderman is considered one of the weakest heroes, but, oh boy, what a show it is when he is in combat and jumps to move all the enemies for his friends convenience!

Of course you can do all kind of things in your base, like building tech stations, training, improving the cards, searching for ingredients and discover many mysteries. You also get to befriend all the heroes and go to some clubs (Book Club with Caotain America made me laugh like hell). Which is nice for the most part, mainly when they tell you about their past life and wishes for the future. What is not nice is that, when you return from story missions, you have to make a looo....oooot of small talk with everybody. Not rewarding at all. That was why I did many, and I mean really many random missions. This is also because the story is typical Marvel and I'm not a fan (I only like most of the X-men movies).

Pros:
- graphics
- you can create really beautiful characters
- combat - the best or in the top three of tactical combat in any game I've played
- combat video effects and animations
- combat - the joy of exploding bombs
- combat is perfect
- meeting and knowing all the heroes (some of them are funny)
- slice of life in your base: you get to relax between missions for example going fishing with Venom or petting your hell dog
- XCOM style missions

Cons:
- too much talking when you return from story missions
- probably we won't get season pass 2",1695801872,1695801872,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

That said, the friendships you have with the other heroes are preset and you don't have any influence other than increasing or decreasing your friendship level. The friendship system is my favourite part of the game and it does feel like you become closer to the other heroes that have interesting and diverse personalities.
The gameplay is fine, the system is complex enough that you have to think about strategy and can get better over time through your skill as well as which characters you choose and deckbuilding. When you complete general missions, you end up facing the same types of battle over and over again, to the point where they start to feel tedious instead of exciting, but mixing up the heroes you use can be fun and novel.
There is a lot of customisation in the game that can be unlocked through exploration of the grounds and through a currency that you end up having surplus of. Customisation is pushed a lot in the game but is something you don't have to participate in if you don't want to.
The story is akin to a general marvel arc, big villain, some henchmen and the end of the world imminent. Midnight Suns focuses on the occult and magical side of the Marvel universe which is a contrast to the MCU. This feels like there is a lot more to learn and explore, which gives the world a lot of depth. The actual exploration of the grounds you do (in third person with wasd controls) is fun and fills out the context of what you are doing. The Hunter is a new character for Marvel but slots into the universe nicely.

As an Avengers game, it is great! The characters sound and feel like the ones we know for the Comics and Movies, with Firaxis's own spin on them that feels both unique and familiar. The voice acting is expertly done, doing every character justice with very good performances. And there is a LOT of voice acting, across SO many characters and Multiple dialogue choices. You could easily spend more time listening to the characters talk than playing the Tactical Battles... and that is a GOOD thing, because it is FUN to hear them banter.

Gameplay wise, I was skeptical of the Card system, but it works! It's more about resource management than having the right cards at the right time. It might seem daunting to have to Juggle the Card Plays (the actual using of the hero abilities and attacks, which you typically only have 3 per round), Movement Actions, Redraws, Heroism (a vital resource stronger cards need, weaker cards generate, and used for environmental attacks that don't take from your Card Plays), and item uses. However, it does not take long to figure out how to handle those resources to do more than just the 3 actions per turn, and it makes you feel smart when you set up synergies between those resources and character abilities. I'm not a fan of Card games, at all, and I LOVED this game's battle system. It is not straight X-COM, but what it is suits Super Hero battles pretty well!

I do feel like this game suffers a little bit of the Power-Level-Balancing other Marvel games suffer. (Captain Marvel and the Scarlet Witch shouldn't be doing, and taking, roughly the same amount of damage as Blade and Captain America). But I can more easily forgive the game for it as MOST of the Heroes present are on the higher-end spectrum of Marvel power levels, and there not really being a good way to stay true to the power differences from the comics and movies AND make the game balanced. Outside of that, the characters feel true their themes and powers in the abilities they get. Doctor Strange FEELS like how Doctor Strange would fight, and Iron Man FEELS like Iron Man as he repulser beams everyone. Every character has features that make them and their play style MUCH more than damage and health numbers, like Spider Man's MANY bonuses and free uses of environmental attacks, which is SO in character for him!

The story as a whole is decent. The character interactions are sublime and feel like a comic come to life or one of the better movies. The plot on the other hand is a bit of a slog, with the heroes Constantly on the back foot for the VAST majority of the game. It feels like the plot of one of the (good) movies, but with 3 hours stretched to fit 60. And it all conflicts with how well you win the various battles. (Enhanced Super Villain shows up. Goes into gameplay, we kick his ass with Plenty of cards and health to spare. Goes to cutscene, and he's kicking our asses o_O ). DESPITE my complaints, the story is still worth experience, as it absolutely gets the emotions and character development right.

Last thing I will say, is that even though the game does that thing we all hate, injecting an entirely new character and making them the center of the story, it actually WORKS here, because of the player character's connections to other less-known but beloved Marvel characters, and how they interact with the heroes. If THIS aspect worries you, don't worry, they actually do it RIGHT.

In particular, the downtime is a slog to get through. It revolves around talking to the heroes in the abbey, forging bonds with them.

Hobbies... other random topics. Which again, shouldn't be all that bad on paper, but that is 80% of what you will be doing in this game. No, I am not exaggerating.

This is why writers will stress that interactions should be meaningful and only happen if it moves forward character development in some way. In a ""dating sim""-esque game, even more so.

Update at 97 hours in

Ok, not a tactics game.  At all.  Its a card came.  Well, it has as much tactics as say, a lazy day game of poker that your playing for bottlecaps.  It is a card game.  Which means RNG fughts.  Make your own mind up about that.  I know what my opinion is.

The graphics are great.  It is awesome to see some of the way they execute the powers, creating some really good visuals.  The combat itself if you get a good hand is amazingly fun.  Unfortunately getting a good hand seems to happen (for me) about once every 10 or 12 fights.

Now, at 97 hours in, I've not reached endgame.  I'm still in chapter 3.  No idea what is left to do, but... at this point, the futility of it makes you feel like it is pointless to continue with it anyways.  Your going to lose.
SPOILERS.
SPOILERS.

The story.   Uhg.
Ok, it starts off great, and until about 1/2 way through chapter 2 your feeling like you are getting to play an entire story arc, including all the side or crossover issues.  Which feels cool at first.  Except for the overarching sense of doom and inevitablilty written into the story.  You lose.  Over and over. Even when you win, you lose.  A light?  A beacon of hope?  Nope, we're going to shit on that too.  We're going to ramp up about mission after mission after mission after misson that will solve this, or fix that, or help the other, and it never does.

Even the small victories feel pointless by the time of the big 'well fuck.'  Yeah, that'd be the conclusion of chapter 2.  It really feels like that is where the game was going to end, where things would finally, finally go well for our character.  NOPE.  Here's a frying pan to the face, you got a whole nother chapter, you've lost thus far, and the big bad that has beaten you at every turn thus far?  Yeah, just got an UPgrade.

However, the fights themselves are fun because of the graphics and effects.  Getting to see your favorite heroes do their thing is really cool.  For about 20 hours.

Then we get to the bugs.  Its Fraxis, so get rid of the launcher asap.  But be ready for regular crashes.

So, in conclusion.  It IS fun.  But it is just as frustrating as it is fun in its current state (9-22-23 posting).   Make of that what you will.  Good luck.

POSITIVES
1. I enjoyed the story. Totally different take than the MCU and I like the melding of the Midnight Suns world and the Avengers. The voice acting is impeccable if you're not comparing it to MCU actors.
2. Exploring the Abbey is a nice change for Firaxis. After spending years on the Avenger in Xcom 2, it was nice to wander around a bit.
3. Building the Hunter is a unique experience and he can fill any role you need him to. I find him most helpful as a healer, particularly in the early game before you gain access to high level heals from Nico/Strange/Wanda.

NEGATIVES
1. The combat is a slog. I was really hesitant about this game because of the card dynamic, and that was probably the part I hated most. At least in Xcom, you had all your abilities to use at will. There were so many times in this game that I was like ""I need that ability right now"" and you have to rely on luck to redraw it.
2. The environments are extremely repetitive. Again, Xcom environments were vast and always changing. Each region in this game seemed to have three generic maps with the same features just slightly adjusted every mission.
3. NO SPOILERS - but the ending was terrible and anti-climatic. If you play through, I think you'll agree.

It's worth a play now that it's cheaper, but I think this game is above average to good. Ultimately, per usual, I think a strong developer wasted a really good opportunity with a legendary IP and the game kind of fell flat. Hopefully some of you see it differently.

In between battles you can explore the rather large Abbey grounds, it's like X-Men meets Hogwarts.  There's mysteries to solve, fun stuff to do.  Then, on top of this you have a SIMs-esque interaction mechanic with the other characters where you make friends with them and this actually has an effect on their combat abilities.  Then on TOP of all this, there's club nights, book club, shop class and the EMO KIDS... after a while, you don't think of Wolverine as Wolverine, in your head you call him Logan, Iron man becomes Tony, Carol... well she stays Carol, Ghost Rider(the new one) is Robbie, you get the picture.  Then ON TOP of all this... you have a pet Hellhound named Charlie that has been waiting at your room door for 3 centuries that accompanies you on challenge missions as well as can summon in combat(though I recommend the bladestorm ability), but the kicker is that if you play the male avatar it's voiced by matt-freaking mercer and hearing him say ""How's my Charley Warley puppyface"" makes me smile every time.  There are also a lot of other excellent voice actors in this game, Blade(I call him Eric now) is played by Michael Jai White who played Spawn in the live action movie as well as Gambol in the Dark Knight, Steve Blum plays Logan and also has done so in countless versions of the X-Men cartoons, Josh Keaton I've never heard of before but he's a dead ringer for RDJ as Tony Stark, almost every voice actor in this game has an IMDB page as long as your arm.
On to the music... none of it is invasive but again, it has that Hogwarts feel to it, epic yet unobtrusive.  You truly feel like you're immersed in this universe of magic and science.

Part of me wants to give this a raving review about how underrated it is, and I think parts of it is just that. The combat, at its core, is really fun and parts of the story did go in ways I didnt expect with twists that I didnt see coming. But the main feeling I take away from the game is that it just feels really scattered and unfinished.

There are bugs that have been around since XCOM 2 and they are just as frustrating here as they were then. The graphics in the environments and combat are decent but the character models look so weird up close, which is odd since so much of the game is spent in conversation with characters. The game has a weird focus on making conversation with the other heroes and while half of the time it feels relevant to the overarching story, the other half is just filled with so much filler conversation that doesn't need to be there. I usually enjoy story-heavy games but here I ended up skipping through so many of the conversations because they just felt like filler. The overarching story is fine, and at times kept me really invested, but the ending is so generic and expected that I wish they would've done basically anything other than that with it.

The game consists of turn-based combat with a unique card play system.
People hear ""card play"" and immediately think ""cheap mobile game."" This caused a bit of sticker shock when this game was released for around $50.

In actuality, while the card mechanic is central to the combat experience, it's not a major component of the game as a whole. The game includes resource farming, crafting, varied character interactions, and exploration components as well (it should be noted though that the entire game is single-player only).

Had this game released closer to a $30 price point, and with better marketing that downplayed the card mechanics and instead talked up the other aspects, then I think it surely would have been a solid hit.

As it is, I strongly recommend picking this game up when it's on sale. It really is a lot of fun. 

EDIT after finishing the base game (about 84 hours of gameplay):
The game got a little grindy between story missions (it was literally the exact same 7 or so battles again and again), and I was thoroughly sick of the conversations with characters and ""hangouts"" by the 2nd act, but it was still a lot of fun. I'm heartbroken that there won't be a sequel to this game. It ended on such a bittersweet note. Having finished the game, I do think it's WAY overpriced given the amount of content.

Was so impressed after 2 hours of game play spent another £40 on the DLCs and restarted with all the extra content.

First of I see a lot of reviews mentioning X-com, this is not x com in fact the only thing it has in common is that they are both tun based combat. Now thats cleared up.

This game has so many fascist its hard to describe. The best I can say is its like being dropped into a marvel movie with you plying the part of a new hero. You get to talk to and become friends with many of the marvel franchise heroes whilst living in the abbey, there is tons of dialog but its all really well voice acted and thought out with some really funny stuff and Easter eggs in there and makes you feel like your actually part of it. The story line is great and you can advance the story as slow or fast as you like as there is tons of other stuff to do.

This game is an incredible blend of Deck-building turn based combat, life simulator and puzzle solving.  
Put simply if you fancy dropping into a Marvel movie and hanging out with all your favourite characters this is gonna blow your mind. However don't expect a fast paced combat game that's not what its about. The combat is awesome and the mechanics are great cleverly using all objects on the battlefield which can be used as offensive weapons, like throwing stuff of kicking stuff into baddies ect. As stated it is a card battler so some thought must be put into deck building and what hero's are gonna be better in your 3 man team for that particular mission as each have there own strengths. 

You can only do 1 mission a day though, the rest of it you spend exploring the abbey, solving mysteries, cultivating friendships, customising the abbey, yourself as well as all the other heroes, deck-building and upgrading stuff. 

Ive got over 50 hours in so far and would say im a quarter into the story. You could rush through and play it quicker but you would miss so much.

To sum up, if you love marvel and want to drop into a beautifully crafted world full of interesting characters and decisions, stunning cut scenes and like turn based deck builders you will love this. Just don't go in expecting fast paced game play with battle after battle, its slow paced so you can savour every moment and look forward to your one battle a day. Enjoy the immersion and don't rush through because you  when its finished you will be sad.

Enough said, buy it its just awsome.

So far the only real gripes I have with it is that there is a recurring performance bug (as in performance is 30 fps+ normally and then suddenly it is single digit fps in perpetuity, and yes my specs are way higher than the recommended) in the Abbey that only restarting the game can fix.  Although it is recurring it is inconsistent, sometimes its fine for hours and sometimes it happens after 15 minutes.  So far it only happens in the Abbey, most often right after the Hunter wakes up for the next day, I think it might have something to do with the UI system and those pop ups maybe.

Game has good pacing, a good narrative, good combat, amazing characters, plenty of things to do to give the strong feeling that you are progressing in some way, and has what i think is a very good ending. i would say on a sale this game is 100% worth it and the dlc characters are also very good and worth it. the narrative on dlc is weaker than the main but is still good.

This game is wonderful and scratches a lot of itches because of the unique (to me) combat style mixed with the RPG elements. It's familiar yet different enough to make it fresh and fun. The card/deck builder system is great and there's A LOT of room to build out individual characters and entire teams that can do some truly wild and fun things together. I found myself gravitating towards certain characters more than others, but they're all viable and fun to play based on your own personal preferences.

The story is fantastic, the interpersonal relationships are fun to see, and there's a lot neat lore/comics stuff scattered throughout every facet of the game. It feels like a lot of care went into creating this and making it feel like a rich environment worth exploring and getting lost in. I knew plenty about most of the characters (Iron Man, Wolverine, Blade) but the inclusion of Nico and learning about her backstory really made it feel like I got something out of it because I wasn't previously familiar with her.

Most reviews just don't cover this game well.  The label of RPG brings with it a lot of expectations.  This doesn't match my RPG expectations.  

Over half this game is simply talking to different heroes.  It a Role Playing Game... you are role playing a character/story.  This is okay if you are interested in all the heroes and talking to them.  

This game's combat s NOT like Xcom 2.  At the heart of it, it is a card game.  There is no turn by turn map where you advance and move around your characters, use cover, take high ground, etc.   It's a tiny little fight area like the old Playstation games where you get this tight circle, fight the camera, and realize is more annoying then fun.  While you can pick which opponent you attack and with whom, but you use one of your cards in your hand to do it.  That's about the extent of battle.  You can also throw an opponent into an object, with careful planning.  

When you level up, you don't get to pick a specific skill, power, or attribute.  As far as I understand you can make some decisions about which power to increase slightly, but I don't consider that true RPG.

So, for better or worse, I'll keep trying this game.  I suspect the combat will be the thing that makes me quit playing at some point.  However, if you feel comfortable with how odd and story-centric it is, then I'd say buy it on sale.",1693961215,1693961799,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The lore you get as a Marvel fan is unparalleled, as is all the interactions with the characters as you build your friendship with them. You also gets tons upon tons of lore with the exploration of the abbey grounds that you can choose, or choose not to undertake in your play through.

The flexibility you have in creating your team, your deck of 8 cards for each hero, and the options you have in combat where you don't even need cards to do damage so long as you have energy and environmental attacks are endless. 

This is a gem of a game that will never get a sequel, even though the ending alludes to one, because it was let down by a greedy publisher who rushed the PC port with bugs, some of which are still present. Near the end of the game, namely in the final battle, it all feels a little rushed as well, as if they just rand out of funding for voice acting and cinematics.

2K also charges 60 dollars for a season pass that has 9 missions total, and four new characters. They are integrated in the game in a way that makes me think they might have been cut content for the sake of a season pass.

This game is worth every penny, but only buy the legendary edition so you get the full package, and only buy it on sale, because even if I love this game to death, greedy publishers like 2K. Their own launcher, by the way, makes the games performance much worse,causing some of those issues with bugs. You can disable the launcher through steam commands, but you shouldn't have to

I highly, highly recommend this title. 

Firaxis, as always, did a great job with making the game play addictive, fun, strategic, and difficult.

This is a really amazing game, held back only by its terrible publisher.

New:

Okay. I found that this game benefits enormously from being played on a powerful system.

I actually bought GFN Ultimate because of BG 3 and now I play MMS almost exclusively.

It really is a fantastic game. Everything related to exploring the Abbey no longer sucks because everything runs absolutely smoothly. Loading times are okay. I like the conversations, some better some not so much ( which is totally okay ).

The battles, the possibilities to assemble the teams, tinkering with the cards is really fun for me.

Pro's: 
-maybe to some the story line could be good, I personally do not like it, however everyone has different tastes.
-If you like story based games (more story less game play) then you will probably like this game. (personally not for me)

Cons:
-IT IS NOT LIKE XCOM. Do not be fooled. If you loved XCOM for the reasons it's challenging spirit and the multi-level depth of strategy, this is far from it. It is turned based and that is the only thing it has in common with XCOM

The are a couple of things that make this game stand out

The card system which is used in combat

prevents you from falling into a rot while using you major heros


i cannot stress how much this (while i can be frustrating at times) improves the overall perpective on the game

each round has the right level of unpredictablity and when you make a good play

Now that is a sense of achievement

the set up with you base and an endless cycle of goodies and interactions with the heros

i would advise you to just enjoy the ride

don't rush this you can have quite alot of fun for many years with this one


while the main mission can take you up to 100 hours

the side missions are infinite

what this missions if you like combat

you can focus on that

if you like collecting goodies

there is also room for that

getting to know marvel lore

is quite exciting as well

there are a number of stand out cosmetics

like iron man and doctor strange

that really take the edge of the visuals

the enviromental interactions and how they play into the combat

makes you want to use them

it's an interesting mechanic how they do alot of damage but don't cost you a card

what that turns out to mean is that players are actively encouraged to make use of them

which adds to the visual treat of the whole thing

the story is decent

but honestly while not being filler

it becomes quite obvious the story is there to serve the gameplay

the game is about game play

again while not being centre stage in the areana

the story does it's job

it informative and to the point

letting and alerting you as to what to do and what is going on

it's also designed with a skip button

and there are mission highlights availble to remind and guide you incase you missed something

there you go

you have a real gem here

1. Crap combat - They have combat set up to where you can only choose one card (action) for your turn during the round. There's literally no option to seek cover, move to other areas of the combat zone, block incoming strikes, or do anything other than attack. In other words, you just have to stand there like a statue and hope that you take out your enemy in one shot or else you're definitely taking damage that you can't do anything about. 

2. Graphics are garbage - The cut scenes look like they're from about 2003. There's no level of detail to the characters at all. Half of the time, their lips don't even match the words they're saying. Shoddy work. Please don't be fooled by the screenshots on Steam; they're enhanced to make it look better.

If you have a teenager or young tween that hasn't played the X-Coms of the world this would be a perfect introduction to the genre. It's deep enough to keep you curious, and the story is perfect for the demographic. I personally found the story to be pretty shallow and often found myself saying ""why am I doing this""? As far as the Midnight Suns go. Nico and Magik I liked quite a bit. Robbie isn't nearly as interesting in this game as in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Blade is Blade and Wanda is pretty underdeveloped other than ""she be powerful"" as far as the Avengers and friends go Captain America is at his Boy Scoutiest. Spider-Man is in college and has quips. Carol Danvers is kind of the generic ""has all the powers"" person. Wolverine is fun. Dr. Strange and Tony have a buddy thing going in the Forge and it's pretty good. Not-quite-RDJ-but-close has some good lines. And for Hulk if you don't know anything about him now you're not gonna learn it here. Caretaker and Agatha are like two sides of the same character but one is a ghost. And Charlie is a good girl. I did like Hunter he/she (you pick) has complex relationships with each person and has a lot of dialogue options. You can play Hunter exactly how you want, however you do have to keep in mind what answers might increase your friendship level.

Game play is quite fun and is clearly the star of the show. Heroes will level, get stronger, and most importantly get better cards. Cards you can make even more powerful. Each character does feel unique and putting together 3 that work extremely well together is a fun task. It's challenging to manage your heroism points for using stronger abilities vs generating those points using quicker attacks on minion enemies. A major gripe of mine is you will spend the entire game playing with 3 characters but the final battle is not a 3 person battle. You will earn many different types of materials, artifacts, credits, etc. This game is one of those with a whole lot of currency types for unlocking different things. It can be a pain to keep them all straight and navigating the menus to convert this into that then back to this to put in a card to adjust it to that you get the idea. Some characters have more customization options than others. Hunter's is nearly endless. The others vary. Some have a lot of clothing and swimsuits (yeah really there's a grotto) and others don't.

Some problems I found where skins not being available, I bought a couple and changed them to their Midnight Suns attire when I unlocked it only to not be able to change it back. Some animations, especially these latter game guarding enemies are like... backwards. If you know someone that can fall into that trap where they spend too much money buying virtual credits steer them clear of this game.

Everything you do outside missions is an absolute steaming pile of garbage. Story, progression, base building, companions, card crafting, ability management, even graphics all of it sucks but because the moment to moment mission gameplay is so fun it is still a recommend.

I cannot tell you how infuriating it is that there is no option to just jump from mission to mission directly and having to return to the abbey (hub world) every time just sucks so bad.

I'm a big fan of the XCOM games so seeing this labelled by a few folks as ""Marvel meets XCOM"" peaked my interest and it genuinely ended up exceeding all expectations. 

I will say  this - if you like XCOM but aren't so much into Marvel, this maybe isn't the game for you. There is a lot of friendship management stuff (alongside base and character management) outside the of missions, which means there is also A LOT of dialogue - I'm an avid Marvel comic reader and even I found myself skipping a fair few conversations just to get to the point. That said, the character dialogue was generally on point and captured the spirit of Marvel, and I thought everyone was really well voiced. 

Overall it has a really satisfying gameplay loop reminiscent of XCOM - do a mission > do some base management > level up characters > rinse repeat. I found it suuuper satisfying and addictive, so much so I didn't even get into the wider base exploration and side-quest/puzzle stuff until mega late in the game.

The gameplay is very clever, too.  The deckbuilder aspect keeps things just random enough, and once you've drawn a card you know exactly what it will do.  (This is a pleasant change from XCOM, since your heroes don't miss or graze.)  The mechanics are easy to understand and allow for complex strategies.

game has a bit of similarities to XCOM but is vastly different.

Deck building is awesome very customizable but wish you could have more than 8 card deck per character
Some special moves have short cutscenes that are flashy
Decent size roster to choose from
Customizable characters (color schemes and outfits) fully unlockable through gameplay

Some people might be turned off with thee amount of weird character banter or sometimes long conversations between characters but if you like some background info on characters lore or funny interaction then it's fine, if not then that's also fine cause you can get passed all conversation pretty quickly and get back right into the gameplay.

Coming from time with XCOM, the card play also helps your superheroes actually feel super without them hiding behind a wall with a 65% chance of being hit. You trade off the chance of being damaged with the chance of drawing the right card in your deck for your situation.

The Abbey does have a lot of stuff to do and can drag on a bit towards the end when I was ready to call it quits and I knew what I wanted to do.

The game is quite long if you want to do everything and it has the same affliction as an XCOM game. The one that keeps telling you that you can afford to do just one more thing before you go to bed.

I had a good time with the combat, with each hero having their own playstyle and role. Coming up with team combinations and figuring out how heroes work together is interesting. I regret, however, that there are no unique animations for specific hero combinations when they do their team-up attacks; you just see one hero attack, then the other from the other side, never appearing in the same shot.

Running around the abbey and hanging out with heroes while they relax between missions reminds me of Xavier's Mansion in X-Men Legends. It's not exactly the same but it makes me wish I could go back and play that classic.

There were some performance issues in the late game that I might be willing to blame on my own aging hardware.

The most positive thing about this game was the story, It was written very well, and I liked the mechanism when you interact with other Marvel characters which I grew up with as a child, It was really fun!

However, the battles were a mixed bag, I liked the animation and the effects of all the heroes. but it lacks diversity, At some point, I found out that both general missions and some enemies are repeating themselves very often, and for me, it's very boring.

Now for the bad stuff:
I played both with my PC and Steamdeck:
- On my PC I had a terrible experience, My system requirements are a little higher than the minimum, and I got many crashes at certain points in both Battles (Ghost Rider tries to attack), and in some cutscenes... I had to consult with 2K support to try to fix it, but they didn't succeed in helping me... I was thinking of refunding this game because of this poor experience.

Long version: This game has a lot to recommend it.  After all, it's Firaxis doing (what looks like) ""XCOM but Marvel"", it goes darker than the MCU will (save maybe Multiverse of Madness), it has tons of character progression goodness including level-ups and collectibles and it's got a mix of characters we don't usually hang out with in the bigger titles like Nico Minoru and Blade.

The problem is that each of those elements just kind of fizzles.  Firaxis is only doing an XCOM lookalike; this is a card game with a very basic tactical element inelegantly bolted on.  The darker themes are fun at first but wear thin once you're used to it.  The collectibles are only very rarely worth anything; lots of times, you're just collecting a currency you can use to buy clothes.  The RPG-style ""progression"" is just a card game's pale imitation of it: cards get incrementally more useful, but you still only bring eight of them into a fight.

The character interactions deserve a special mention.  They form a crucial part of the game's appeal; it clearly wants you to enjoy talking (...well, listening) to all of these characters a whole heaping bunch.  They invested in the writing time and voice talent into making these characters feel as ""you are there"" as possible.  

Here's the problem with that: I. DON'T. CARE.  I mean, it's fine at first, whatever--but the amount of time they just want you to spend hanging out with these people is almost impressive.  This is a big problem for me, but maybe it's not a big problem for you--maybe you want a Marvel Tea Party game.  For me, though, the thing that made me just stop playing one day and just uninstall it a week later when I tried to play again was the realization that I didn't particularly want to hang out with them any more.  They aren't awful, they aren't hilarious, they aren't...anything super unusual.  They're them, and by necessity they can't actually interact with or listen to me at all.  We aren't friends and I'm not there.  Why keep listening to this?

Everything else in the game is mind blowingly slow paced. There is so much dialogue that I'd say about 75 - 80% could be cut and you wouldn't miss out on any details.

They do keep the hangout sessions brief but eventually they start to repeat and its just another thing that drags on and on and on.

Sound like fun? Then go and immediately buy the full version (ok… maybe wait for a significant discount), the game can actually be quite fun if you can look past the huge number of flaws, grinding, repetitiveness and tedious chores. If not, then this game is probably not for you.
The missions are the fun part, with (usually) 3 heroes each with a unique deck of 8 cards, and 3 actions (for the whole party) per turn, not counting some free actions. You build up heroic points using “basic” attacks & support, then can spend them for strong finisher moves or to damage enemies using the environment. The enemies get reinforcements every turn, so you’ll rapidly be in trouble if you can’t efficiently eliminate them. The mission ends when you complete the objectives. The problem arises when you realise there are only 2 factions you will battle in the whole game, with a 3rd one you will meet 2-3 times in the story missions and never in the other missions, and the DLCs are adding a 4th one, each faction consisting of minions aka cannon fodder & 2-6 different enemies. They try very hard to add some variety to the missions, for example, zonk every enemy, or get the crates before they explode then zonk every enemy, zonk the helicopter or the trucks before they run away, then zonk every enemy or capture the agent and zonk everybody… you get the picture
Every hero is unique and fun to play, but there are very little to no synergy between them. Getting a perfect score (3 stars) usually means you must finish the mission in 2 turns (6 moves) in normal, making the support/defensive/tanks heroes pretty useless. OK, you just get less Gloom with 1-2 stars, and Gloom, except for gifts, is only used for buying the tons of cosmetics, but I felt the entire game that the best defense was attack… Yes, you can spend your turn buffing your heroes, giving them block/buffs/healing them, stunning your enemies, making them bleed to death eventually (after their next move), or you can just plainly kill them before they have a chance to hit you. The story missions have fixed members, but you may bring who you want in the general ones. Your main hero will probably always be part of it for a few reasons (gaining friendship & auto-leveling the other members), and by the end of the game he will be so overpowered the only reason not to include him would be to make the game more challenging.
There are tons of dialogues/cinematics & interactions with every character (and yes you can fast forward the “static” ones or skip the whole scenes), including the DLCs, but the core game consists of only 21 story missions (and a few ones are filler), with the DLCs adding a total of 13 others. The post game contents add almost nothing, just general missions against higher level enemies for more (& extremely expensive) customizations. If you’re wondering, buying all of them would require 160-200 000 Glooms, each individual one costing 50-300, with a few up to 1000, and a 3 stars mission at normal gives 100 (and around 220 at the hardest difficulty)
There are quite a few bugs, mostly minors & graphic glitches, with a few fatal crashes when starting the game, game freezing up to 2 minutes when saving & sometimes before missions (happens more frequently end game), final mission is very laggy, with dead enemies sometimes forgetting to disappear, but there is an unforgivable bug preventing you to get the ancestral suit for your main hero. With the game being considered a commercial failure & the devs long gone to other projects, it’s very unlikely they will ever be fixed
They hate cheaters, kicking you out of your single player game for thinking about using a program like Cheat Engine, but Mods works very well. In fact, as far as I know, they are the only way to get the ancestral suit, and you may find some very useful QOL improvements, or a way to make the mindless grinding less annoying
In summary, this is a game with a lot of potential, an amazing amount of work & attention to details, but ultimately is drag down by suspicious design choices that might turn down every but the most compulsive players. I’ve been killing the same 10 enemies in my last 100 missions, but man do I look cool running around, gathering mushrooms in my selection of 100 T-Shirts!",1692626890,1692626890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good:

Excellent and complex combat card system that is surprisingly easy to understand and fun/addictive.  Not without problems but very good to see something new done after so many years of copied game formats.  Learning and experimenting how your different teams of super heroes play together stayed fun for the full 90 hours i played the game.  The combat alone is enough to make this game very very good in my eyes.

Difficulty always feels right and is adjustable on the fly.

Information given about how everything is and what it does is fantastic, makes a complex game quite easy to understand.

Animations looks great,

Every character plays in a unique way that feels right for their character, which is a quite a feat after getting around 17 of them... maybe venom isn't unique enough only, and storm could use more skills then a completely lightning based set, but her set makes sense for setting her character apart from the others?  

Love the unique banter between sets of superheroes when brought to missions.

All heroes can be built a couple of different ways, Dr strange can be a full support/healer or large damage dealer for example, and suits playing with different hero setups.

Epic last battle!

The ok :
Music is ok
There is a very grindy nature to the game especially in preperation for the end battle if you want to play on higher difficulties (though you could new game plus instead, which id recommend as it would be more fun, the missions are better than the optional battles)
The grind itself while normally horrible in games, isnt so bad considering the complexity of playing around with different hero comboes makes each fight feel different, and there are a couple of small catchup mechanics.

The bad:

The story unfortunately could use work and is mostly just about a bad guy you cant beat on your own so you have to make super friends and talk to them about life problems... not engaging enough.

Would be cool if you had subtle changes to your heroes that you could make to add to the play style of the heroes like your main character has with their collar.

Would be great if you could slightly tweak the end placement of many of your heroes abilities, as placement is so ridiculously important in this game.  It sucks when you have to spend a movement to move 1 step left, when the character could have done exactly that and still pulled off their previous attack, but no option to angle it. 

Epic last battle could use some checkpoints... the fight goes for over an hour, 1 mistake on hard and start again folks T_T.

Ironman seems a little too much like the kid who got picked on all the time in school and makes hilarious jokes all the time to deal with it... maybe like spiderman? Seems odd, but i don't know my comics back to front :P.

All in all a very fun game with unfortunately a mostly skippable story, highly recommend a play through.  No idea why they are saying it wasn't a success.  You can tell this is one of the few games these days that were made for the love of games and not just the addiction and market projection for sales of games, this needs to be supported to see a turnaround of the trash that gets released these days too often.... so play it :D!",1692498122,1692498122,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some highlights for me.
No random misses. Except for 1 character, basically none of your attacks are based on random chance. You can come up with a plan and execute it.
All of the 17 characters have fairly distinct card selection, make each feel unique.
The games dialogue was a hit for me. Even some of the repetitive idle/filler dialogue after a full playthrough,

1) Narrative story. RPG style with decision selections that raise/lower your friendship with each character or the main character's Light/Dark rating. Friendship and Light levels grant bonuses in the combat phase of the game. If you're a Marvel fan the writing is decent and stays mostly true to canon. 

2) Combat. Turn-based. Limited actions per turn to play cards from each character's deck. Each character has a customizable deck of 8 cards that are all shuffled together at beginning of combat to make a 24 card deck. Combat has interesting elements such as environmental effects, combos, status effects. Puzzles with enough complexity to be interesting and enough variety to not seem too competitive. There's a main story line and side stories if you got the DLC. There's always multiple side missions with varied rewards so you can stretch out the game's main quest as long as you'd like.

3) Exploration. Running around the home base area looking for hidden things to gather collections, unlock RNG chests, etc. This aspect appealed the least to me.

The amount of spoken dialogue is absolutely bonkers, my first playthrough with everything collected and doing everything that can be done including DLC took me roughly 100 hours (can be done in 60 hours or so but I just loved to grind levels to get every card/costume/item) and never was there a re-used dialogue between characters nor does it get repetitive. Everything feels genuine and the source material love from the writers speaks for itself.

The combat system is like a love child of Slay the Spire & XCOM, while everything non combat related is a homeage to the crew member interactions on the Normandy in Mass Effect 2. It's a shame that a sequel in any sense is probably never going to happen, but if you're in doubt, get the game with season pass in a sale without rethinking. I paid 40€ for the package and it was worth the pay to every cent. I might be superhero tired moviewise, but this game rekindled my love for the characters and comicbooks. 

Played the entire game on Steam deck without much issues, but from around ingame day 120 the game was showing some weird issues. Battlefield would be black where I couldn't see anything but my cards, saving my progress sometimes took 3 minutes. It could be due the fact that I overstayed my welcome in the game with grinding everything to the bone where I could've finished the game halfway the playthrough, but definitely became frequent the more deeper in went into the game.

Then, as they showed off more, and showed the card system, I got concerned.  Then when a few reviewers mentioned the portions in The Abbey, being boring, but there being so much of it. And so much pointless conversation.... I didn't buy it at launch.

This is in my top 5 (non indie) games of the last decade (right up there with Witcher 3, XCom 2, D2: Resurrected (whatever it's my top 5), and Doom 2016). For me, this stands with them. Similar to the above, I will be going back to this game at some point in the future (New Game + is a thing here). 
That said, it 100% won't for everyone. What I will say though, is you get a pretty good feel what this game is in the first 2 hours. Buy it, try it, refund it if you hate it. 

Card System - Didn't think I would like it, but it's great. You unlock new cards for each character, and can build a deck of 8. Different characters can play off each other and each has their own niche. It works beautifully. The only characters that were kind of lackluster, IMO, were the DLC characters, and Majik (which sucks because I like her character so much). Overall though, the system is fantastic.  I would say for MOST people, this isn't going to be a problem unless you have a deep hatred of card systems (if you do, buy it, play for 2 hours, and see). 

The Abbey - OK so there is something a little janky about the Abbey portion. That said, it would me over after a 5-10 hours, and I found myself 100% exploring the Abbey (technically I think I had 2 Mysteries left to solve). It's basically 3rd person exploration with some puzzles. A lot of it involves character moments that are great. It's also well worth reading the Journal pages, as it gives a lot of backstory that, IS shown at the end, but it's so much more meaningful with the Journal pages.

The Characters / Talking - OK so I understand why some (like SkillUp) did not like this. I get it. BUT.....I thought it was great. Don't get me wrong, there were a few characters I skipped Dialog on (again, mostly the DLC characters), but for the most part, I really enjoyed most of the conversations and was happy to sit through them. Some of the characters are stand outs compared to others. Nicko and Majik were stand outs imo, along with several others.  It started out as fine, then I went through a brief period in the first 4-5 hours where I was like ""oh my god just let me go do a mission"", but it found a good pace I would say 10 hours in.  And some of all of that may have been me exploring too much of the Abbey at the start.

DLC - OK so after about 5-10 hours, when I knew I was hooked, I read some comments that recommended buying the DLC before finishing the campaign.  So that is what I did and here are a few things I will say.
1. The DLC is fine, but if you are tight on money, or aren't sure about the game as you are starting out, don't feel like this is necessary. Deadpool and Venom are OK, but I had a hard time caring about Morbius or Storm (who I thought I would love). 
2. The campaign involved, is pretty good. Liked it quite a bit. It's about 10-15 missions across all DLCs. And it does connect. So if you are going to buy the DLC, I would recommend just getting the season pass for all of it.
3. Should you buy it before?      That depends. I find myself, wishing I had waited, because I WILL plain new game plus at some point in the future, and it would have been great to have some new characters and story for that playthrough.   That said, if you think there is no chance you would play the game twice, and you want the characters, then yeah I would do it near the start of the campaign. 

Overall, this is a fantastic game and I would leave to see this team make a sequel. Originally I thought ""I wish they had just made another XCom"". Now, would be thrilled to get another one of these as well. So good. Highly recommend people at least check it out. Refund if it's not for you.",1691982487,1691982487,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the best marvel game I have ever played. The characters act exactly like they really would. The writing is great. The story is great. It's like being part of the marvel universe, getting to hang out with all the different characters. As you play the game you will realize why they put in the characters they did. Such an addicting game. I just can't put it down. I sincerely apologize to the creative team for hating on this game before I gave it a chance. So much content and so gratifying to continue to unlock new things.
**EDIT**


I hated the idea of cards and too much story. I'm a huge XCOM fan. I'm a huge Midnight Sons comic fan.  I waited to buy this game because I was mad about them changing the name and the aforementioned cards etc.

I have to say that this is a really fun game. It takes a good few hours to get into it and get going. Once you do, it has been really enjoyable. I usually just read/listen to the first sentence of dialogue unless I'm really interested in that part of the story, so I know whats going on but I don't have to hear things I don't care about.

I would say give it a try if you like marvel, like rpgs, like strategy/tactics, like building relationships with other characters etc.

Still playing this game, not completely done but i am enjoying it.

I see the major complaints about the bonding with teammates and too much talking. Of course there some characters I don’t care to hear. You do not have to do the side quests and bonding stuff. But without doing that you will have a harder time completing the game as their cards will be the basics. Over all i feel the game is balanced with gameplay and story.

Have you ever wanted a Story based deckbuilder that plays it's combat out through Cinematic 3D combat?

The only game i can think of that comes close to this style is a game called Dead in Vinland, It's a RPG/visual novel/survival game with Line combat, it also has the collecting, base building and upgrading/management side of things but they are vastly different in so many ways. Still it's as close that i think anything else would come. It's also a david verse goliath, Midnight sun's is a high budget AAA and Vinland the indy underdog. I'd suggest playing both!

Everything about the Abbey makes me question why I even play games anymore.  I hate everything about it.

Then mission starts and it's an entirely different, better, actually fun game.

Pros:
- The card based combat system is great. Most heroes really have a good feel them, Capt. America uses his shield the way you would expect, Spiderman uses the environment really well, etc.. The difficulty levels work well and because it is a card based system, the combat choices vary greatly based upon the 'hand you are dealt'
- story is solid, some cut scenes are really exceptional
- a reasonable set of enemy combatants that have their on style and how you have to combat them
- looks very good/great, heroes look and feel like heroes

Cons: (these are mainly during the initial game play, first say 6-8 hours of play)
- Tutorial is not very good (a better tutorial would have probably meant a lot more sales). After awhile you figure out what needs to be done and such but not clear at all after the tutorial. 
-  too much extraneous/extra dialogue. Some may like it but wow, so many chit-chat stuff that really doesn't do much as far as the story  (much of it really, meh). You can ESC through it but early on you can't tell what is important as opposed to what you can skip. Once you get a feel, can ESC through but it adds to the tedious feel.
- Too much tedious stuff to do. Gathering... like why? Just tossed in. Sure you can make good stuff with the reagents but this isn't an MMO, this is a HERO game. Shouldn't be rummaging around, should be story and combat focused. Dialogues, too many (as mentioned). Puzzles... mild puzzles around the grounds that just waste time but have to be done. Chests to open... more time-consuming nonsense. Whole Abbey part of the game should be streamlined. Some of it is good and does fit but roughly 50% can be tossed, it detracts from the main game. (think of Fallout 4, was it a settlement building game or a kick-ass combat in the wasteland as you look for your son? The lack of focus detracted from both games. It should have been 'do main quest' then you can start building settlements. MS could have done the same, do main story then you can keep fighting and if you want explore around doing 'Abbey adventures')
- The voices were all good (each heroes voice fits well) but there is rarely any inflection or any emotion behind it, I assume computer generated. It makes for some boring monotone/'flat pacing' while various heroes discuss their traumatic back stories.  
- no idea why but your character runs about with that marsh-mellow feel that devs seem to add for 'realism' but just feels awful to both control and to view. Absolutely no need for it.

Middling:
- reasonable replay and extended combat
- little bit of overlap on hero abilities, though overall a good job. Think they could have used more debuffs, distractions and specialized taunts. Like Spiderman could have a taunt that makes the mob target him but he gains a 'dodge' that has 'X%' chance of avoiding the attack, etc.. 
- Hero Ops. These were ok but definitely could have used more here in design/effort as opposed to the Abbey grounds stuff.",1689212012,1691630601,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

People describe it as XCOM with superheroes. This isn't XCOM. This is a JRPG, and not a very good one at that.

Combat has minimal tactical positioning. 90% of the time, the position of your characters doesn't matter. Now and then you need to move a hero to line up an area of effect attack, but mostly you just play cards to perform attacks, and it doesn't matter where the hero is or where the target is. When the enemies get a turn, hero positions don't matter at all. It's really not much different than the oldest JRPG combat where characters stood in lines and alternated whacking each other.

Combat doesn't really feel right, since the heroes all seem kind of equivalent in some ways. Two different characters that ought to be very, very different hit pretty much the same way for the same amount of damage. The only time heroes feel unique is when they're doing special attacks. Special attacks that feel like JRPG special attacks rather than superhero moves.

The other JRPG aspect is the cutscenes. The endless cutscenes. Sometimes I'd sit down trying to get to a part of the game where I actually did something, and I'd have to sit through 30-40 minutes of characters talking where I wasn't even selecting dialog options. Blah blah blah blah.

There are dialogs where you do get to choose what you say. Sort of. You'll select a dialog option and your character says something completely different that's only vaguely related to the dialog choice. Most of these dialogs are just filler,  not furthering any sort of plot. They might gain you Friendship points, but they're uninteresting to me as a player.

It probably gets better. There are hints of more interesting cards I haven't seen, and eventually unlocking things if friendship levels get high enough. The problem is I'm 5 hours into the game, and I'm really, really bored.

I’m really sad this game didn’t sell better - the combat mechanics for this game are really fun, and I actually prefer them to X-COM. Instead of plodding forward from cover to cover carefully and cursing missed shots, it’s so much more fun to improvise with the cards you get on each round. When there are fields of damage ticking down, it’s fun to use abilities to both do damage to the buy guys and reposition characters. Knock back mechanics and environmental damage were great, and the game even felt forgiving by having mechanics to redraw hands. Heroes all felt different to use, and the game forced you to use different combinations, which kept the combat feeling fresh.

Whoever designed that combat system should be proud. Just an excellent rework of the XCOM forumula.

The story bits were between OK and fairly good, once I got past all the heroes not sounding or looking like they do in the movies. I get that no studio is going to get the actors from the movie to do all that voice over work or lend their likeness, and while it was a bit off-putting at first, it was eventually good enough to tell the story.

I’m a bit more down on some of the card aspects - in particular the re-rolling for mods. It felt more like a way to let the player grind infinitely to roll over and over again for the “good” mods like free. While I like the game, I didn’t want to grind missions and play the loot box game over and over hoping for the best mods for cards or feel underpowered because I didn’t grind enough. But otherwise the card system was good.

The Abbey systems felt a bit “tacked on”, as if it was a way for the programming team to split the game up into 2 distinct parts to make it easier to work on. Wandering around the abbey grounds to open free chests for mostly junk was not great, and harvesting resources for consumables just felt like a waste of time. There was some good story stuff using the Abbey that justified it’s existence, but I’m not a fan of pointless and obvious timesinks. If they had put the reagent gathering behind more combat challenges and made the rewards meaningful, then it would have been more fun.

But those are minor complains. The meat of the game was the combat and story, and Firaxis nailed that. This is definitely a game I would recommend to friends, and I hope they have a nice long tail as more people “discover” the game.

This game is for you if you like/love marvel and can stand  long personal dialouges of the heroes and the adventure part which consists in running around and solving simple puzzles.

Pros:
*Combat is fun (gets repepetitve in the long run though)
*If you like marvel you ll like the characters (most of em at least)
*story even though not the best is decent enough.

Cons:
*Repetetive(every part of the game:combat, exploration, dating activities.)
Note:relationship part isnt dating per se it's a ""friendship simulator"" so you never go beyond that)
*A little bit woke @some parts
*ending
*combat is fun could have been much more complex though. Imo wasted opportunity


The game seems liked they had mtx for the cards in mind which would have made the game an even lesser ""success"".

Anyhow still would like a second game that would advance the mechanics and maybe be less repetetive.

In short, gameplay is mediocre at best.
Battles are card based, which doesn't feel great in a strategy game like this one.

Relationship with the other heroes, which take a lot of game time unless you constantly skip everything, is terrible. It could have been great, like Firaxis did with XCOM: Chimera Squad, with brilliant dialogue and interesting and well fleshed-out characters. But instead, we get dialogue an characters that are boring, cliché, cringey and sometimes down-right annoying.

Also there is an exploration mechanic which gives you rewards in cosmetics and battle items. This is very poorly executed, making you roam the same areas over and over again, with very limited fast-travel.

Another thing worth mentioning, the game has a lot of ""woke"" culture on the characters, and, one could argue, also in the story. If you enjoy that, maybe that can reduce the impact of all the terrible writing and characters. Conversely, if you don't like that, it would make it all the worse.

1) The loop is weak.  Your ultimate purpose is to defeat the ultimate Evil  by doing missions to collect items that allow you to upgrade your cards and gain experience. However, there does not seem to be intermediate goals to motivate you playing any further. 

2) The Midnight Suns world is small. Exploration is solo and tiny in size.

3) The graphics are average by today's AAA game standards.

4)  Combat is card based.  Up to now, it has consisted of 3 heroes taking on 4 to 6 hydra  nondescript soldiers and officers in a small arena with little diversity. Additional hydra waves are generated a each turn. These are hardly credible opponents for your superheroes. 
The most frustrating part of combat is the lack of control on the movement of the heroes. Up to this point, it has been 1 move per turn for my party. That is not a lot for 3 heroes! 

5) Loading times between combat and non combat scenes are noticeable.  

The sad reality it that in my 20+ hours of play, I have not experienced one WOW moment! Thus I can not recommend this game.

Note: I decided to stick with the game for several  more hours just to make sure that I had not made a hasty judgement.

- Only three heroes per mission, with one typically being selected for you and another being your created character
- The abbey exploration can be un-intuitive 
- Created characters dialogue 
- Feels like a lot of the abbey mechanics (forge, intel, sparring, selecting mission, etc...) could've been done from an interface (Like XCOM 2's avenger gameplay) instead of an open world.

Hey guys I 'm going to keep the review simple as hell. I have written 2 pages so I am going to cut out explanations and details.  Keeping it real short and to the point! 

Pros 
-  Great Story Line, thoroughly enjoyed it
- Great visuals in Missions and side missions
-  Great Combat Animations, exaggerated and overly top special effects
- Awesome Game Mechanics.  Basic Mix of Xcom, TCG and RPG Elements. 
Its like a new Genre.  A simple version but effective.
- Best playable characters. Some From X-Men, New Mutants, Avengers and Midnight Suns. Cool! 
- Great simple fast pace tactical turn base strategy type of game I have ever played.  :)
- The game is so creative that the creatures and heroes abilities affect 
the gameplay, the environment, the status effects and forces you to counter situations 
like no other. 

Cons
- Graphics and Visuals look somewhat PS3/PS4
-  Animations are very average for 2023
- Friendship mechanic boring and repetitive 
-  Babyish dialogue, Vague and dry. 
- Main character : Poorly executed and uninteresting (Hunter)
- Not a complex or deep enough Card strategy Game or Tactical turn base.
Enjoyable but I would have loved if they focus even more on the gameplay
and less on dialogue. 
- No Mulitplayer. Clearly this would be one of the best multiplayer!

Mini Thoughts 
Marvel's Midnight Sun shines in its game mechanics. Its hardcore, creative, overly exaggerated,  strategic, 
complex, detailed and very unique. I haven't even clock the story. Too busy unlocking new cards from doing missions to amp up my hero cards. I definitely do not like the visuals of ''Abbey'', This  Skyrim Hogwartz vibe and models looks too simple, basic and poorly designed. Gears of war 2 from Xbox 360 still looks amazing compare to this. But the Visuals looks stunning when you do the missions.

Steam keeps asking me to say whether or not I like the game. If you could see my Steam profile, you’d see that Marvel’s Midnight Suns is the game I’ve played the most (and it’s not close); in fact I’ve put more hours into it than any game I’ve played on Steam in the last five years. So yeah, I like it - quite a bit.

Marvel’s Midnight Suns is a tactical, turn-based combat game from the guys that made XCOM but using cards instead of abilities and mashed up with a RPG adventure game all set in the Marvel universe with our favorite Avengers (Iron-Man, Hulk, Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel), Spiderman, Wolverine, and the Midnight Suns team (Ghost Rider, Blade, the Scarlet Witch, Nico, & Magik) and the Caretaker. You play a new hero - the Hunter, son or daughter (you get to chose) of Lilith, mother of demons. The Caretaker is your Aunt, sister of Lilith. With the Caretaker’s help, and that of Agatha Harkness (yes, that Agatha), you killed Lilith once before, stopping her from bringing the dark god Chthon into the world. That was roughly 300 years in the past, and also resulted in your death. At the start of the game, you’re resurrected and set once again on the path of stopping Lilith, who with the help of Hydra is again trying to bring Chthon into the world. Along the way, you work with the heroes you’ve assembled to foil her plans, working from the “Abbey”, a Medieval fortress brought magically from “Transia” to just outside Salem, Massachusetts. Exploring the Abbey and the grounds, you’ll discover what set Lilith on her path. You’ll also make friends with the other heroes, ‘hanging out’ with them and giving them gifts to increase your friendship level and sparring with them to build up the combat level of your team. You can make additions to the Abbey, like a Lab and a practice combat area (the Threat Room) as well as customize the clothes & costumes of your hero and all your buddies, as well as customize the look of your hero. There’s also your pet devil-dog, Charlie, who can help out in some of the missions (and in exploring the Abbey grounds). You can also scour the Abbey grounds to find treasure chests (which require keys) and reagents to make magic potions, etc. that can help you in combat.

If you get the Legendary edition, you get 4 additional heroes (Deadpool, Venom, Morbius, and Storm), each with their own missions (3 each in a separate story involving ‘vampyres’ and Dracula, and a 13th mission where you finally defeat Dracula. The nice thing about these extra heroes is that once you’ve started their first mission, then you can add them to your team for defeating Lilith. Of the four, my favorites were Venom and Storm.

The combat is tactical and turn-based. For most missions, you have three heroes and each hero has 8 cards. Over the course of the game, you get new, better cards - which you can upgrade and modify to make even better. Cards can be ‘attack’, ‘skill’ (heal or defend), or ‘heroics’. There’s also ‘environmental’ moves - bombs, rocks, platforms, etc. By building up your heroism during combat, you can execute different moves. You get three cards per turn, but certain cards are ‘quick’ so if you knock out an opponent you get the card refunded and get to draw another card. Oh, and did I mention the cards you get to pick from each turn are randomly chosen? That’s where it gets tricky - deciding which heroes to take on a mission (sometimes you don’t get to choose) and the interplay and cards to use and the order to use them. 

Some folks complain that there isn’t enough combat. It’s about 45-50% of the game. The rest of the time you’ll spend at the Abbey, making friends and exploring the mystery of the Hunter’s past. I personally thought it was just fine and enjoyed solving the mystery. Not to mention ""book club"" with Blade, ""Eco kids"" with Magik & Nico (and others), and ""Shop Class"" with Robbie, Peter, and Tony. And getting to know Nico & Magik better. When the time came for the final battle, they were two of my four highest champions - along with Cap and Spidey. When you get to that point in the game, you’ll better understand what I mean.

Sometimes, especially at the very beginning, the dialogue is a little juvenile (e.g., calling Tony Stark “Robo Man”), but as you go the story generally gets stronger. It’s a fairly dark tale, and I won’t spoil it.

What I didn’t like. The resource hunting could be frustrating; once you harvest something once, it will only occasionally reappear. And the game isn’t always clear on the fact that you have to advance the story in certain ways to access parts of the grounds. The price. $100 to get the Legendary edition was steep; I bought it on sale for $60, which really to me is the perfect price. There are occasional graphics glitches, and I’ve seen some folks report game breaking bugs (I have not experienced the latter myself).
But the positives far outweigh the negative. I had a lot of fun playing this game. 

There is a new game+ mode - and from what I’ve heard it’s good, especially if you’re a completionist. I’ll likely eventually go back and play to do that, but for now, I’ve enjoyed my time.

- The combat is honestly very refreshing. Yeah, the card draws can suck, sometimes, and yeah, I agree that the move mechanic seems arbitrary, but the versatility in which you can approach the game is great.
- Befriending everyone. I actually really appreciated this function in the game and I enjoy how it was integrated. The fact that it encourages you to build relationships with all the characters is neat.
- Lots of features. While the game suffers from a tiny bit of feature creep, there is really a lot to do, and it almost never feels like a chore. Most of the side quests and other objectives in this game are fun, too.
- The abbey design. I know others reviews say they don't like it, but I actually think the scope and design is fantastic. Great job on the execution.

The bad:
 - There are some pretty frustrating bugs in this game. My least favorite is when the dialogue starts jumping ahead even if you're not pressing anything. 
- The story. It's not bad, but it does feel rushed in its last act, and sometimes, it hits some corny melodramatic notes way more than it needs to, especially in dialogue between The Hunter and Caretaker, which I wish the game didn't focus so much on, surprisingly. They're great characters, but there's not enough lore to stretch these two characters into what I ended up turning into 100 hours of gameplay. The DLC doesn't quite remedy this, either.

I recommend this game. It's worth a purchase. Even at full price, you get the bang for your buck, I believe. Although, if you're getting it for the story, I'd probably get something else.

From the trailers, it looks like it's an XCOM strategy game with Marvel Heroes, and you'd be right to think that (they even joke about it in the game).  However, it's actually different and I couldn't be happier. This was such a great time and I'm glad I finished it.

Let's start with the story first. You play as an original character simply known as the Hunter (whom you can fully customize). You have been resurrected in a strange dimension called the Abbey. Your mother, Lillith, has been brought back to life by the forces of Hydra and you need to work with the Midnight Suns and the Avengers to put a stop to her evil plans. You've been asleep for centuries and getting two teams to work together is gonna be tough, ESPECIALLY when it's prophesized that the world is doomed and some villains as heroes fall under Lillith's thrall. Can you and a handful of heroes really put a stop to it all and save the world?

Okay to delve into what I was saying earlier, Midnight Suns is XCOM + Persona + Slay The Spire combined together. XCOM in the sense that you will be battling on a map, turn-based tactics style, however, you use cards to fight instead of just actions. Wherein XCOM was about hiding in cover and percentages, MS is more about knocking enemies into obstacles or each other. It's really simple, and as you learn your card abilities, you'll turn 3 action turns into crazy combos that wipe out enemies in flashy style. Each hero you recruit has 8 cards to them so deckbuilding is not hard whatsoever. You'll combine cards, gain new ones to strengthen them into better versions, and even modify them later in the game. It's pretty fun to mix and match the cards to your style and play to each hero's gimmick. Doctor Strange is good at buffing the team, Magik makes portals and good at knocking enemies into things, Iron Man's cards get stronger when you use redraws on them to buff them, etc.

The Persona style of the gameplay is what loses a lot of players. In between missions and story bits, you can walk around the hub world of the Abbey and spend time with the Heroes. Talking to them, hanging out with them, or even handling some of their requests will increase your friendship meter. As your friendship with them increases, they'll gain passive buffs and when you reach max friendship, you can do a challenge mission to get their new costume and ultimate card. The hub world does slow the pace of the game down and in the beginning, I wasn't too fond. But as the story progressed, I loved it. I liked learning about the heroes, seeing them interact with each other, and seeing the funny scenes where they formed ""clubs"", it made them more likable and not just characters I use in battle. 

Outside of talking to the Heroes, you can also explore the hub world of the Abbey and it's HUGE. You can do side quests and explore around to gain magic keywords that unlock more areas and treasures so you can get recolors of costumes for yourself and the heroes. The exploration is optional, so you don't really have to go out of your way to do it, but it does add some nice lore to the overall plot.

There are a variety of missions you can do aside from the story missions and doing so will help you raise your heroes' levels and get loot. You can get new cards for the ones you bring along on missions, find artifacts so you can research buffs to upgrade the rooms around the Abbey, and more. It's actually pretty cool to see the Abbey grow and change as you gain new things as well as get better cards for your heroes. The gameplay loop was enjoyable, aside from a few hiccups. Voice acting was fantastic and I loved the heroes they used. Most of them were popular ones with a dash of a few that some people might not know (I was so hyped they used Nico from the Runaways!). I could have finished the game sooner, but I was having fun grinding and increasing my relationships with the heroes. The whole game plays like a long MCU movie, from the cheezy one-liners to the epic set pieces and I wouldn't have it any other way honestly.

However, this game is not without its gripes. I've had plenty of graphical glitches, and slowdowns where the heroes or enemies stand in place and don't do anything for a few seconds instead of acting, but luckily I've never had a crash issue. I've had the same problem as other players where sometimes the dialogue would skip forward and I'd hear them double up over each other during a conversation. The biggest offense I think is the lack of a fast-forward button. Just like most tactic games, seeing the animations for the first time is great, but when you are 20-30 hours in, sometimes you just wanna move things along (Nico, you are best girl, but your high-level spells take sooo long to cast). If you like to grind like me, you'll really hate the lack of that fast-forward button even more because this game loves to throw hordes of enemies at you. Woe unto you when you get to the late game and even their animations take a long time to sit through. I read other reviews and agree that there is a lack of enemy variety. Once you get Act 3, you've just about seen all the enemies, and aside from the Bosses, there's nothing left to shake things up.

Final verdict, despite my lengthy gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I sunk 70+ hours into it and I regret none of it because I had a blast. I lost a couple of missions here and there so the challenge was just right for me. I recommend this game for players who love Marvel games and strategy card games. HOWEVER, be prepared for lots of dialogue in the ""getting to know you"" hangout phases of the game. They are long but if you like getting to know your heroes and seeing some funny dialogue, then it'll be well worth it. I sooo wish they would make another one of these games, but, alas, I'll just have to come back and do the DLC chapters if I want some freshness again.

Just want to add to my original review that I've now spent over 600 hours on the game, doing multiple playthroughs and trying out various custom rules I make up for challenge runs and I never find myself getting bored.

Just from the gameplay alone I think this game provides seemingly endless hours of entertainment once you get into it, and I haven't even downloaded (or made) any mods yet!

The DLC that came out adds a lot to the game too, and I really hope they make more.
I would happily buy more DLC at full price, this game is so much fun and I love how it writes the characters.

[b]~ - [u]Original 2022 Review[/u] - ~[/b]
More RPG than strategy game, but with a healthy chunk of both genres, this is a different style of game to one you might expect coming from Firaxis, one tailored more towards immersing you in a world rather than flinging you at constant battles.

That's not to say there aren't battles aplenty to be had, because there are a LOT of them, but rather than bases and battles, the majority of the focus of this game seems to be on environment exploration and characters.

And I think it does those things pretty darn well.

-- Game Length --
Took me 120+ hours to play through my first playthrough, though that was a playthrough where I unlocked everything, maxed out every friendship, and got every achievement apart from full Dark points (as I had committed to a Light playthrough).

So there is plenty of content to engage with, but it's also a game you could probably breeze through in 20 to 30ish hours if you just focused down the main story and did little else.

-- Gameplay --
As for the gameplay, improving character stats and modding cards was addictive, it had a good curve of progression, and decent room for self expressing and experimentation. 

The fights themselves were ones that I never ended up getting bored of, even through all my hours of probably a bit too much grinding, and a shout out to the animation teams for the in-fight animations: The game is beautiful in combat at max settings and high FPS, though this does lead to a bit of an odd contrast with the quite clunky cutscene and dialogue animations, but that's forgivable enough.

The exploration back at the Abbey was surprisingly my main reason for coming back to the game during my first 40 - 50 hours of gameplay, I feel the game's captured that sense of eerie wonder that some early Harry Potter titles and Fable 1 managed to do quite well. 
Which in truth is probably my biggest surprise of the game, I did not expect so much of this game to be about exploration and mystery solving, nor did I then expect to find myself loving every minute of this side of the game (which I did).

-- The Writing --
It's strong in the character interactions, be it via the game's in-built fake social messaging system where you can read the characters talking with eachother about all the things going on in the game (both big and small), or via the hangouts and various conversations you can listen in on or join in in person.

It really does do a good job of making you feel like you're living with all these people, and I quite liked most of those people I shared the Abbey with, so it was a good time.

But it must be said that the writing takes a bit of a nose dive when it comes to the main plot.
Basically, nothing will surprise you if you've seen this kind of plot before, well, almost nothing, the second arc had some nice, admittedly small, curveballs in it.

But the plot gets you from points A to B, and allows the real good writing (the living with everyone at the Abbey) to exist within its literary casing well enough, so it's not the end of the world.

Though another thing worth noting is that the writing never makes an attempt to explain why Captain Marvel isn't just flying all your enemies up into space, or why you only send 3 Heroes out on a mission and the others just chill at home while the world is burning all around us, or why it takes Iron Man multiple missiles just to blow up a General Mission Objective glass container, or any of that power level stuff.

Obviously the answer to all these things is ""it's so the video game can exist"", but it's sad to see no attempt at an official explanation given for any of this, it's basically left up to player imagination to come up with their own headcanon explanations.

-- Overall Impression --
Definitely a game I'm glad I bought, and a new direction for Firaxis that I hope they pursue in future titles.

I was honestly pretty disappointed by vanilla XCOM 2, it felt quite uninspired to me at the time (though the later DLC expansions did a lot to make up for that), so seeing Firaxis try something new, both in terms of how they handle strategy gameplay, and in terms of overall game design (with this game's focus on exploration and characters) was a pretty cool thing to see.

This game's not perfect, but it's got a lot going for it, and it feels like a game the dev team wanted to make.",1670813995,1690954708,True,41,2,0.738830089569091797,0,True,False,False

To me, all that is a plus. The game takes a while, which means you are with your favorite characters longer. The characters and their unique abilities all feel genuine, and honestly it's some of the best writing in a game that I've seen in a long time, give or take a few awkward moments. They really managed to capture the comic side of Marvel with a little hint of the MCU mixed in.

There are plenty of things that may be considered problematic elements. The game tends to suffer from occasional stuttering and camera glitches. A couple characters have some graphical issues (at least for me, running an NVidia 980 Ti, one character in particular has a graphical bug on his neck that is VERY prominent). Pacing wise the game does get bogged down at times before speeding back up, and it can cause a little feeling of whiplash when that happens. The microtransactions aren't in any way necessary, either. 

All in all, the game is a must have for long-form RPG players, Marvel fans looking for an Ultimate Alliance-style story, and/or fans of games with unique tactical elements. If you can get the Legendary Edition on sale, even better. The characters that come in the season pass are well worth it, as are their storylines. I got the Legendary Edition on the summer sale and I don't regret it at all.",1690953311,1690953311,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But a friend of mine mentioned it and I thought I'd check it out during the steam summer sale. It turns out it is a surprisingly deep game play experience with a wide assortment of Marvel heroes. 

It very much feels like XCOM II style game play, but mixed with a less punishing deck building experience.

Be warned though that:
1. Developing friendships with the super heroes is a big part of this experience. Which at times almost feels like a dating sim. It's kinda weird.

2. Sometimes you will find yourself smashing an enemy or having a good team chemistry only for the cut scenes to say otherwise.

To sum up. I'm liking the cosmetics, game play, and tone of the game. It's worth a shot if you like turn based gameplay and marvel.

Is it worth the price? Well the $1 an hour rule sais it is, even at full.

However - I am a massive Marvel fan and after c.40 ingame days of the same game loop, I was praying for this to end.

The game loop is terrible.  Wake up, talk to ppl, have 1 battle, go night, maybe talk to more ppl and adventure the grounds (I almost fully explored but consider this an unnecessary side game for cosmetics that noone will see anyway). And then sleep.

Combat - is actually good.  There is a combo here of card plays and strategy; whilst it is certainly no x-com, it has to be given credit where credit is due.

This game has a deep deep well of lore and story from which to drink and I enjoyed every moment of it. I loved exploring the abbey grounds, completing mysteries, reading the lore and getting to know Agatha. 

Things I loved:
- Charlie. She is the best girl and you know that right?
- Story, I always wanted more.
- Sub-Stories, I always wanted more.
- Lore, I could read lore all day let alone have it given to me by the heroes.
- Exploration, I enjoy exploration so this gave me a nice little side thing with extra lore to discover
- Befriending everyone
- The Clubs! More clubs or club meetings!
- Combat. I enjoyed lining up or planning out the best way to defeat all the enemies in as few turns as possible.

Things I would change/add:
- Being able to edit your decks/salvage cards from the training yard.
- If there is no story event happening let hang-outs happen more often.
- Mission info pop-up that occurs at the beginning of every mission is not necessary after the first time you do a mission like it.
- Combat animations could be condensed or have a ""speed up"" option you could turn on. 

Overall I adored this game and will be playing again. I look forward to seeing Midnight Suns 2.

The tactical layer is weak. Positioning is unimportant, abilities are very samey, and there’s very little ability to think tactically because your actions are restricted to a handful of random cards each turn. Draw all support, healing, or defensive abilities? Tough luck. 
Because it’s a card battler with three plays a turn, a hero getting KOd doesn’t matter. Losing a soldier in XCOM can easily lead to a squad wipe or at best a much more difficult mission, but here it’s a mild inconvenience. 
If this wasn’t bad enough, the cards themselves can be upgraded in a number of ways, but the caliber of the cards does not increase. Instead, early game abilities are by far the most useful, so there’s no incentive at all to unlock or upgrade abilities. 

The strategic layer (running around the mansion and hanging out with heroes) is a huge time sink, and nothing matters.
-	Loading times of almost one minute between missions and the strategy layer, even with a SSD.
-	Each “day” in game has THREE separate skippable cutscenes. One for the Hunter to get into bed, one landscape scene, and Hunter getting up. 
-	After you get up each day, there’s a number of tedious tasks that don’t matter in the slightest. Go to do research and unlock the previous day’s cards, go to the training area to build friendship with another character, stop by the gift shop to buy presents, stop by C.E.N.T.R.A.L. to do an off-screen hero mission for a pointless reward, and THEN select a mission. These things could have all been done through a simple interface, but you have to run all over the mansion to do these tasks. 
-	There’s a lot to do in the strategy layer, but you’ll probably be in the middle of the game or later before you realize none of it matters. Unless you really want to go fishing with Wolverine, or go to a (repeated) book club with Blade.
-	There’s a huge amount of collectibles, but literally none of them matter. Even the mission rewards don’t.

This is a game of two halves, turn-based combat while clearly inspired by XCOM and Fire Emblem that takes those sources and evolves from them into something fresh. The second half, instead of building up your base, weapon & armor tech (although you can do that too) is spent getting new abilities and upgrading your favorites to develop the combat styles of your team. 

After missions you can hang out with the team members of the Avengers and the titular Midnight Suns, seeing them trying to live and work together to prevent an ancient prophecy. 
The Abbey grounds also has challenges and mysteries to be completed for those who want to explore the history of witchcraft in this corner of the Marvel Universe. You can also design cover art for your own comic with the heroes from the missions you send them on. 

There are some issues:
- Menu system can be slightly uncooperative
- Exploring the Abbey grounds feels restrictive at times, like it is forcing you to stick to paths
- Performance issues, mostly immersion breaking. Not buggy or prone to crashing
- Pacing can be quite iffy at times
- Character models aren't great.
- Some characters talk too much, like rants that wouldn't fit inside comic book speech bubbles.

Cons
Pretty grindy (note the 105 hours of playtime)
Feels like there's too many resources at play: coins, crafting/upgrade ""coins"", cosmetic ""coins"", optional real money coins for different skins, reagents for crafting, keys for opening chests, artifacts, cards, blueprints, intel points, gifts, compliments (yes compliments to raise friendship are a collectible resource).
Some of the outfits have model clipping issues that can come and go
Too many picture frames lol

Pros
The card based combat is really well done, enough of a unique take for it to be worth learning but not too difficult
Most of the characters abilities feel unique, depending on play styles different characters might be your favorite
In-game changeable difficulty levels (granted I'm not sure if the later difficulties are balanced well, I stopped increasing the difficulty when I felt like I started struggling)

Terrible story. I mean, you have to try super hard to make a story about Marvel Heroes so vanilla and uninteresting. It's not possible that it happened on accident. The ""Every Choice Matters"" slogan from the trailer is a lie, bold faced. Nothing you do matters. It is very very linear. What you say may affect what some one thinks of you, but it won't drop you below the current 'Friendship Level' you have with that character. So, in short, you can't make them hate you, not really, I tried. It's also not like you can change the outcome of the story or even any of the situations. Nothing you say or do will have any affect on the outcome of any quest what so ever. I have over a hundred hours in this game, because (aside from a really fun and addictive card system) I like to see the different directions an rpg can go, this one doesn't go anywhere. The majority of the games story (for what it is) is trying to make you hate the classic characters and drag you into constant nit pick sessions between the characters. I mean, these Super Powered Crybabies all act like it's junior high all over again. Trying to find clicks and see who can be the most dramatic at any given moment. Everyone has their feelings out on their sleeves. It's interesting at first but half way threw Chapter 2, I just wanted everyone to shut up. Especially Nico, Dear Lord she never stops!

Fun Combat with an Interesting Strategy Card System, Absolute Gold! 8/10
Graphics, Beautiful. 7.5/10
Music, Fantastic. 6/10 (-1 point, because as awesome as it is, it is mind-numbingly repetitive)
Voice Acting, Very Well Done. 7/10
Story.... Ehhh 2/10 (+1 point for good voice acting)

Honestly, it just seemed like an excuse to make a Marvel game with no real direction as to what kind of Marvel game. Its not thought out. As I said, most of it is meant to make you hate the 'Old Guard' and if you grew up reading Midnight Sons, Nightstalkers, Darkhold, etc, don't expect to see much that will bring back the joy or sense of wonder those titles held. The Midnight Sun's in this game universe are all younger heroes (even Blade claims to be in his 20's but as a half vampire he's not really sure.

The story plays over a period of 50 to 100 days, whereby on each day three members of your team battle enemy forces, and you also do tactical research, investigate mysteries around your home base, and hang out with your buddies.

The battle system is card-based: each of your team members has a hand of eight cards, which are shuffled together and from which six are drawn at the start of the battle. The battle plays in a small environment where you can move about. You play cards to buff your team or do damage to enemies in a variety of ways. In general you can only play three cards before all the surviving enemies can respond, though with smart play you can get a few more cards out, and you can also use the environment to do damage to enemies. All battles have a goal, varying from a simple ""kill everyone"" to ""defeat specific enemies which hold extra cards which you must play to accomplish something specific."" After each battle you get some random cards which you can add to your decks; you can also upgrade cards or add modifications to them. When you level your cards get better, but enemies level with you, so that the battles are always balanced.

Next to the card battles there is a surprising amount of story to the game. There is an overarching rather mundane plot which goes along the lines of [spoiler]""there is an evil boss who sends out smaller minions and larger demi-bosses to hurt the world, and the player is the chosen one to stop this, but oh no, the boss is actually not evil but just misguided and manipulated by a god-like being who is the actual big enemy you have to fight at the end.""[/spoiler] Next to this big plot there are lots of interactions between the various team members and between the Hunter and each team member. Most of these storylines just play out in front of you, and allow you to make the occasional choice but nothing that influences what happens. 

There are two more, smaller gameplay elements, namely exploration of the area around your home base, where many interesting discoveries can be made, and about 20 small ""puzzle-battles"" where you get a specific set of cards to defeat a specific number of enemies in a specific configuration. The puzzle battles generally award you with a unique, very strong card for one of your team members.

For me, [i]Marvel's Midnight Suns[/i], which I played with the four DLCs included, is a really good game with some severe flaws. Let's go over the game elements one by one.

The battle system is interesting and fun. For most of the game you have access to about 15 different team members, and each of them plays very differently. Mixing their cards together makes for a high variety of configurations. What I found striking is that when I search for ""best heroes"" for this game on the Internet, I found that what people consider ""best"" varies enormously. Some heroes which are ranked low by one site are ranked high by another. There is no hero of which everyone says ""that one is really good"" or ""that one is really bad."" And that is my experience as well: I had my favorites among the heroes, but I found that my favorites changed during the game, when I discovered new tactics. The game also stimulates you to use every hero regularly, which keeps the gameplay interesting.

While I enjoyed the battle system very much, the story elements I enjoyed much less. There is simply far too much babbling in this game. There are so many conversations going on, and you have to do them all, because they tie in to the ""friendship"" system and the ""dark/light"" system, and as these systems are strongly tied to the card battles you must go through them. After the first few hours I just started clicking as quickly as I could through all these conversations, if that was possible, because content-wise there was very little to them. I must admit that one reason that I did not care for all these conversations is that I don't care for the whole Marvel Universe. I never got into ""superheroes"" and frankly, I find it just stupid that they mixed every theme possible together: magic and science and technology and ghosts and vampires and demons and Dracula and the devil and nazis and machine guns and prophecies and conspiracies and motorcycles and alien goo and ancient gods and new gods and a guy who becomes a green monster when he gets angry and an evil book and portals to a chaos dimension and the kitchen sink and lord knows what else (and yes, all of that is in this game). The fact that the overarching story is of the type ""how many times have we seen that before?"" does not help. I don't think games actually need a good story if the gameplay is fun, but if the story is not good, then don't spend too much time on it.

The exploration of the area around your home base is interesting for a while, but unfortunately you have to return to this area again and again to gather resources and open chests. Luckily there is a fast-travel system so it does not take too much of your time. The exploration aspects are an okay addition, but not really a necessary one.

The last gameplay element I mentioned are the puzzle battles. In general, I like this concept: you get confronted with a situation and a hand of cards, and now you have to figure out how you can achieve what the situation requires of you. There is always a way to do it, but it usually is not immediately clear how to do it. The problem here is that many of the puzzle battles did not actually offer you all necessary information at the start. For instance, you may get the option to discard one of your cards and get a new one. What new card you get depends on which card you discarded and when you discarded it. The only way to get information on that is trying it. And IMHO a puzzle should not REQUIRE trial-and-error. Overall, half the puzzles were fine, and the other half a missed chance.

There are two more blemishes I want to mention. First, this game is badly optimized. This is the first game for which I had to set all the graphics to ""low"" and it was still stuttering. And it is not as if these graphics are anything special. Sure, my computer is in need of replacement, but I have never experienced anything this bad. The game also crashed a couple of times on me when I started it. And I think there is a memory leak somewhere, because occasionally the game gets ridiculously slow when you try to make a manual save. Second, while the voice acting of most of the characters is pretty good, the voice acting of The Hunter, the protagonist, is barely passable. There is no emotion in that voice at all. I played the female protagonist, and maybe the male one is better. 

I did two playthroughs of the game, one on Normal difficulty and one on Heroic III difficulty (all in all there are eight difficulty levels and Heroic III is the fifth). After the Heroic difficulty levels there are the Ultimate difficulty levels, which up the ante quite a bit. I considered doing an Ultimate III playthrough, but I noticed that people who do this eschew most of the heroes for a very small subgroup of them, because only a few heroes are really able to take on the highest difficulties. That is unfortunate, because one of the biggest draws of the game is the fact that you can play all these different combinations of heroes, with different abilities, which make each battle interesting. Limiting yourself to just three heroes sounds like a grind.

If you like interesting tactical battles, this game is worth playing, even if Marvel does not do it for you.",1690619982,1690619982,True,2,0,0.548872172832489014,1,True,False,False

These are probably the worst representations of Marvel character's I have ever seen. For example: Blade, Captain America, Captain marvel and Wolverine all join a book club. Blade only joins because he has a crush on Captain Marvel and Captain America only joins because he thinks Blade wants to be his friend but in actuality Blade doesn't even want Cap to be there because he's afraid Captain Marvel will fall in love with Cap and not Blade. Blade and Cap are scared to speak up about their feelings so uh-oh, it's up to us to sort this out. And Wolverine? well.. after he's finishing going berserk and slicing his foes up into little bloody chunks he's attending book club meetings and sipping on teas.

I can't see anyone enjoying the dialog which makes up for about half of the game. The writing is like taking a cheese grater to my private parts. To compare the writing to nails on a chalkboard would an insult to chalkboards.

(EDIT: I also have completely ignored the DLC. No idea if it is good value for money. And the 'premium currency' stuff bolted on by 2k is just silly. Ignore it.)

The turn based combat part of the game is absolutely outstanding. I thought I wouldn't like the randomness of the card draw but it is a lot of fun, making you think up new strategies on the fly and not just relying on the same 'optimal' strategy every turn. In the 46 hours I've played so far, I think I've only been screwed by the RNG just not giving me usable cards once. (And I could have built the decks better.)
One thing I like about Midnight Suns compared to XCOM is that it is a move at your own pace game and much less punishing. Don't get me wrong, that sort of feel is essential to XCOM, but here it makes the game feel more like a superhero movie and less 'stressful'. I don't have to be constantly thinking about how a risk might set me back hours in the campaign, possibly even wrecking the campaign.

Unfortunately, the rest of the game varies between acceptable and not-so-good. The inability to save multiple decks per character is a bummer and something I really wish Firaxis would have added. The card pool available for characters also feels too small. For example, having different types of quick attacks available to each character so you can tailor their strategy would have been nice. You can do some of that with card mods, but it isn't the same.
Hero balance is also a bit of a mess. Just about every guide to the game notes how Captain Marvel is just underpowered. Blade is also let down by how events are resolved; his unique thing is applying bleed modifiers to enemies. Unfortunately, Bleed damage applied *after* the enemy acts. The limited healing options means the overall strategy is not taking damage, but Blade's whole thing is accepting weaker cards/increased setup to in effect give the enemy more opportunities to attack you. 
The way the game is setup and self-balances means you aren't screwed by using weaker heroes, but then you have a mission where you bring out top-tier heroes and you are like ""Oh, yeah, why am I using the other ones again?""

The Abbey interactions is where the game really starts to struggle. The Bioware style of conversations and hanging out with characters is very hit or miss. Some are great, like just about anything with Ghost Rider; while some are just boring, like Magik. The quality is all over the place and it is obvious Firaxis was unsure how to approach the thing so they just threw everything at the wall. I'd say the character interactions are most similar in quality to Bioware around Dragon Age Origins or the original Mass Effect.

Abbey exploration on the other hand is a combination of tedious exploration and fetch quests. 

The story is fine. I'm not a huge Marvel person, so I have no idea why people care about the Scarlet Witch so much and hearing her constantly brought up did get grating. The pacing of the plot also feels a bit off. 

I have no problems with the visuals. I'm running the game at medium on a 7 year old computer that was good when I made it. I have some massive but brief framerate drops when there is loading going on in the background, but nothing more than slightly irritating. The environment design is extremely boring, but thankfully the animations - particularly the superhero attack animations - are great and haven't yet gotten old.

Now i know why this game dropped price 75% in the last 3-6mo. Its a PURE TURD.,1690506819,1690506819,False,4,0,0.455035567283630371,0,True,False,False

Game performance is also a problem sometimes but mostly just made me laugh and they weren't really game breaking. Stuff like dialogue not playing, text is missing and just shows the text file itself (Final_Final_28 for example, which was funny - we've all been there), and animations not going through in fights - things like that. 

I was not a fan of how difficulty works in the game though, I will say that. Enemies just get ramped up like crazy and will KO heroes in 2 hits, but they have like 5x your health.

But there's also a strangely genuine side to it. A lot of dialogue lands just fine on the funny or heartfelt side. The combat has the perfect superhero feel as you pinball around mooks to combo into big hits on tougher villains.

Wolverine seems to be a little weak compared to the other characters. 
 Most tactical games uses the Xcom method of having two actions per turn so it was nice this game tries something different and I believe it is successful.  I agree there is a little too much busy work in between battles which you could skip  some of it especially if you keep the game at lower difficulty and not trying to max out everything.

I appreciated XCom for tactics gameplay with a strong growth arc in the design to keep things interesting for many many hours. This game seems to just jam in a bunch of random modern game design trends bundled with a popular franchise. 

So far as Firaxis tactics games, XCom Chimera wasn't loved by all, but I'd argue that it simplified gameplay in a thoughtful manner, so I still found it enjoyable on a similar level. But this game reduces the tactical play to deck building and random card draws, coupled with very simplistic and often nonsensical spacial positioning. It plays very much like a mobile game and could probably be ported as such, if there weren't a needless openworld-ish metagame superimposed on it, which felt to me very unimaginative and forced. Not to mention tedious .. imagine if the original xcom made you run around the base waiting for elevators to get to the research lab, etc. rather than just sensibly clicking around the UI. Or gathering mushrooms. Seriously, you pick mushrooms in this ""xcom"" game. Why .... ?

I suppose if you're a huge Marvel fan and don't want a deep tactical experience, maybe the metagame would provide enough value to make this worth your time.  Though not top tier, I'd say Firaxis has done a lot to step up their production quality. I did find a lot of the character banter pretty formulaic and tedious, but I'd also say I'm pretty fatigued on the Marvel style, so I have some bias. 

Fans looking for more XCom tactical play should steer clear and replay xcom2 (with crazy good expansion) or Chimera to scratch that itch instead. This seems like a real miss too, I could imagine a superhero game in xcom's tactical gameplay style being an easy win. Maybe the studio was concerned that it'd feel too similar to existing franchise and considered a lazy franchised money grab so they panicked and went with an a la carte design .. idk. I do appreciate that Firaxis is stepping out of the sequel trap a little and trying different things.

The first 2-3 hours were me trying everything possible to fix the myriad of issues this game presents at first installation. I have a beefy system and I was getting massive performance fluctuations that I tried almost everything to fix. I still get micro stutters that stop sound from playing correctly, but am powering through it because I enjoy the GOOD parts of this game. But jesus there is just SO MUCH BAD.

The Good:
-The card battling gameplay is super fun
-The card collection system feels rewarding
-Combining hero abilities off of each other is very fun
-Getting the heroes to interact with each other is pretty neat and can feel immersive at times

The Bad: (EVERYTHING ELSE)
-PERFORMANCE: This game runs like it was baby's first project out of college. Everything from navigating the menu to loading up new music tracks causes the game to stutter. For a studio this big to make a game this sloppy when backed by licensing money from Disney is just a travesty. The 2K launcher itself legit harms this game. If you work around it to launch directly from the binaries and remove the launcher from the equation you can see a 40% or higher boost in performance. While laughable this is NOT A JOKE. I am running a 3080TI and have this locked at 60 frames with a resolution half of what my monitor is built for and I still get drops and stutters (which causes audio issues as well)

-THE LOOK. This game looks just so bad. The main character (you) are 2x to 3x more detailed than all of your friends which just makes them stand out more. It looks like upscale mobile game graphics. I know it kind of works for XCOM, but this just does not cut it for what they are trying to do. All the skin is over glossy and I've scene better looking character models come out of DAZ Studio. IT's bad and it pulls me out of it so much. Peter Parker's face looks like it was molded out of Play-Doh. I'm not normally a guy to harp on graphics but you cant look THIS BAD and perform THIS POORLY. Like fuck?!?!?

-The side activities add an unneeded amount of padding to the game. Like I'm all for building a party and deepening bonds, but they have a star studded cast in terms of voice actors in this game but it has some of the FLATTEST performances I have ever heard. It's a travesty. I know Matt Mercer and Yuri Lowenthal can do better than that. And whoever the fuck told Laura Bailey she can do a Russian accent is a liar and needs to be fired.

There are a lot of unnecessary systems built in here and if you just took the card battler into a simpler format and removed some of the voice acting, this would make a decent game. I can't believe I'm going to say it but if you stripped it down to its basics this would make for a fun little $5 mobile game.

I cant comment on the DLC because I haven't gotten to it yet. 

If you buy this game you're a sucker. There is so much promise here but it feels like they just weren't trying. If you can get it on deep sale then go for it. Otherwise it might be a good time with a black flag.",1689980832,1690071369,False,3,0,0.45685279369354248,1,True,False,False

Midnight Suns shakes up a lot of the recent turn based tactical games by mashing a few game play genres together. I am still very early in the game and have not had time to really upgrade much but have looked ahead on YT for a better understanding of the mechanics overall. I do recommend the game to anyone who likes the Marvel comics content, especially stuff from the original comics [lots of references and Easter eggs] to even nods to the MCU. I also recommend this to turn based tactical fans who have enough of an open mind to grasp how to best use these mechanics and the inherent flexibility afforded. 

I will return and complete this review with more gusto and defined information once I have completed it. I waited for the Legendary edition to go on sale and have not regretted any of my time. The only minor gripe I have is that the collectibles should at least be marked with an icon or question mark to denote when they might be out on the map. You don't have to show each one, just give us a general consensus that there is something of interest in that area.

Thanks to the card system combat is really dynamic and even if you play the same heroes every encounter will be different thanks to the RNG. There is a lot of variety in enemy types, most of them have special abilities which makes you adapt your strategy to them and main story always throws some unique spin on general encounters.

Game is really dialog heavy. Its kinda like Persona 5 with XCOM style combat. There is this day cycle where you talk to people, upgrade your cards, build facilities etc. then you go on mission and then at the evening you can explore your base or join hangout with other characters.
If you like Marvel, you will really enjoy this because dialogs are full of references to comics and MCU. Voice actors are overall pretty good and characters are well written.

I think it's a great first attempt and I would have been excited to see a second attempt, but I fear it's killed Firaxis as we knew it. I blame the fact that the first thing you see on the storefront is the fact there are 3 seperate versions (including a legendary version) AND premium curreny on top of a season pass for a single player game.

I got the legendary version which comes with everything eexcept for one blade skin which you get for linking your account with the 2k launcher. I recommend disabling the 2k launcher as it causes a number of performance issues.

The general gameplay is this: Each hero has a specific playstyle dictated by their cards. Magik focuses around moving characters around, Captain America has a lot of cards around block and protecting allies. You take 3 heroes and enter a mission, which can be taking down a singular enemy to destroying a particular target. It's fun and each hero is unique and fun to use, but the balance can be a bit off at times. Ignore tier lists as they are generally very end-game focused, Spider-man is great during the campaign, but falls off as environmental attacks don't scale. 

The only 3 heroes I would say are bad are Captain Marvel, Blade and Deadpool. Captain Marvel deals pitiful damage until you play 3 of her cards, then she does okay damage. Blade revolves around single target damage and bleed, but doesn't really do THAT much damage and has no way to inflict bleed. Both characters were effectively merged into Morbius, a DLC character who does both Captain Marvel's and Blade's jobs better. Deadpool is the worst character in the game by far, a terrible thing to be when people pay £12 to get you. He feels designed for a different game. His research is literally the best in the game, offering you a free attack (more or less) and was absolutely crucial in some missions for me.

The post-mission stuff is fine. The abbey is neat and fun to explore, but you can do all of it by the beginning of act 2 and it doesn't track the mysteries you've solved. There is FAR too much talking in this game, which is odd as it caps at level 8, but there are 80 (!) potential levels to get (12 base heroes + 4 DLC heroes, who each have 5 levels). You'll max out your friendship level long before actually maxing out your friendships, so it just becomes a grind which is what drags out your playtime. It doesn't help that a bug stopped hangouts (your main way of getting friendship xp) from happening, meaning I had to drag various heroes with me to get small drips of friendship xp with them. 

The actual conversations are fine, I liked them! Deadpool is a hard character to get right (he can be Borderlands tier awful in a bad writer's hands) but here he can be actually funny! I liked each character and I don't think I disliked any of their arcs, however Ghost Rider's arc of him working through Imposter Syndrome struck me as annoying (like c'mon, you're a spirit of vengeance hand picked to avert the apocalypse, you're clearly in the right place).

A side effect of the friendship grind was the fact that the abbey stuff became repetitive. Wake up, open gamma coil, select research, daily sparring, upgrade cards, select hero ops, pick mission, then bed. I was kind of hoping for a research to allow me to do all that in a menu, instead of walking around the abbey constantly, causing what could be a minute to be extended to 5 minutes.

In terms of bugs, it crashed quite a few times, some characters would flee of screen only to rubber-band back to the map for no reason. This isn't a bug, but Venom (another DLC character) is pretty broken, there's no animation of him transforming so many cutscenes that aren't specifically Venom's (which are like, in hell, or being chased by Demons) have just plain old Eddie Brock in the cutscene, only for Venom to magically appear in the cutscene. It's hard to explain, but it's wierd seeing all the other characters fighting demons, and Eddie Brock is just fist-fighting a demon dog, like, why are you not Venom right now?

Customization is lack-luster. All characters have unique clothes, but they are all variations oft-shirt, jumper, tanktop, some type of bullet-proof vest for some reason or hoodie. I would have preferred a smaller number of clothes but that suited each character.

Enemy variation could be better. There's no many and most strategies boil down to 'Just deal as much damage to them as you can in a single turn'.

All in all, I liked this game, I think it's a great first attempt and if you enjoy tactical RPGs you'll love this. I will admit there's not much depth (each hero is an independent character and their decks don't really mesh, generally you can just take whoever and you'll be fine) but even then this is still a lot of fun. 8/10

Story : the main story mid. the ending is not my kind of thing. but the character story are really good. 
Gameplay : a little twist for tactical turn based with card system. bring party max 3 person is not enough enjoyment. at least bring 4. 
Presentation : the graphic is good event my setup was 2019 pc. also they have more dub voice not only in english but many language. the icon for mission tracker is confusing. UI really good. the Cutscene very good. many motion in their animation are funny but it adds the charm. 
Sound : the acting for the main cast (both avengers and midnight suns) really good. i like it. the dub as well. the SFX are on point. the soundtrack not very much. 

the game still have bug and sometime i encounter glitch because the GPU in question. but overall this is good game. my complaint was the selection of the avengers into the midnight suns team which is for me are not click. better have fantastic 4 with midnight suns or some X-men team member.  

that said, this turn based tactics superhero game are really really apreciated. 

Thank you Garth Deangelis for making this game as your last banger even if its not perfect superhero game, especially marvel superhero game.  

i just hope that Fireaxis did not stop just to release one tittle. i hope they make another superhero turn based tactical with another team and greater plot. This thing would be the equivalent of ""Super Robot Wars"" gameplay but with american superhero.

Clearly from the amount of time I spent in the game completing it I enjoyed it but the total package is so frustratingly uneven and downright poor in parts that I can't recommend it.

The game splits fairly evenly into two parts, the combat encounters and everything else. The qualities of the game are unevenly distributed between these halves and if you enjoy the game is largely dependent on your ability to ignore the deficiencies whilst enjoying the positives. Combat is pretty quick, focusing on blasting the enemy with strong abilities, using the environment and targeted aggression. The other aspects of the game are slow, boring and mostly consistent of uninteresting busy work drags horribly.

Firstly, the combat. The card mechanics are great, decks are small enough, cards are evenly powered and there are plentiful rerolls that mean you are never depending on luck. But there is enough uncertainty that your tactics in any one fight will depend on your draw whilst your overall strategy is defined by the deck you've built. Each of the characters feel notably different, and different combinations of characters change how you approach a fight. Using the environmental attacks, pushing enemies around, and using the space are all really fun and add a lot of decision making to each encounter.

This is all good but not perfect. Firstly, and least importantly, I can't say that any character really plays in a way that makes me think of the marvel comics. Iron Man uses rerolls to boost cards, chains attacks together based on how many of his cards are in your deck, can make enemies marked and vulnerable. This is mechanically interesting to play in the game, but there is no reason why Captain America couldn't have the same powers with different animations. I didn't find this affected my experience that much but it also highlights how little this game uses Marvel as an inspiration, a theme I'll return to later. 

The combat arenas themselves are small and flat, lack variety and feel the first version of something that could be greatly improved. For example, the environmental attacks are fun but there are a handful of defined types; barrels that explode, things to push, ledges to jump off for a big attack, crates to drop on enemies. There are normally roughly the same amount in every arena, and all operate in largely the same way. It feels underdeveloped, there is little ingenuity required from the player. Just position the enemies and heroes correctly to use the items in the sole defined way they can be used. As the game does not use any cover mechanic the only reason positioning matters is so your heroes can use these environmental elements and not be hit into them for extra damage. You don't need to be in specific positions to use 95% of the cards. Your hero just moves into the necessary position when you play the card. It adds to the sense you are not really managing a combat encounter, just playing cards and watching animations. As the arenas are small and flat this problem becomes more apparent, and the need to fit 5-8 interactable items into each small area makes them look unrealistic and staged. The contrast to XCom and Chimera Squad's detailed, varied and realistics buildings, streets, offices and warehouses is very apparent.
Enemy design is limited. What enemies exist work in interesting ways, from basic goons all the way up to the main villains of the game. But there is very little variety both in number of enemy types and in how different each enemy type is from each other. Again it feels a little under developed.

Now the problematic half, let's start with the obvious. At one point in the game Blade invited me to a book club along with Captain America, Captain Marvel and later, spoilers, Wolverine. The first book we read is Sun Tzu's Art of War. After one meeting it becomes apparent that actually Blade fancies Marvel and he wanted to discuss a book with her as some sort of date but Cap, the dullard, invited himself along so Blade needed me to make it less awkward. Does any of this sound anything like any of the characters I've named? Not only is the writing completely divorced from the supposedly Marvel inspiration it’s also just bad. Dialogue is awkward, delivered poorly, and incredibly boring. I cannot emphasise enough how dull all this is. Not only is it boring and out of character, it’s also ginormous. Everything is voiced and there are clubs, hangouts, friend levelling up conversations, havens as well as tons of other random conversations and an in game social media site which is somehow more inane than regular social media. These superheroes squabble like high schoolers about who invited who, who's opinion is listened to, who is friends with who. It drains the life from the game. Why would I even want to save such a bunch of whiney malcontents? But you have to engage with this content. Better relationships with the heroes increases your 'friend' ranking which unlocks passive powers for each character, better combo abilities and finally their legendary card. These are things you want to increase your options in the actually fun part of the game. You can also explore the grounds of the base. It is pointless, drowning in tortured dialogue about magic, and very boring.

But what of the main story. Well, it’s much worse. The game is about a demonic threat to the earth, I mean there is a basis for this in Marvel but it’s probably not your first thought when you think of the comics. The threat is poorly defined, relies on nonsense talk of prophecies and parchments of power, has no believable stakes and rolls along at a pedestrian pace. I never felt any urgency to complete a story mission instead of a random general mission and I never cared about anything that was happening. When missions feel neither urgent or important and you don't care about any of the characters the game just drifts into a series of unconnected combat arenas.

Much of the story and writing problems come back to the main character. 'The Hunter'. invented for the game this character is like a piece of self insert fanfic. All the superheroes fall over themselves to tell you constantly how great you are, how perfect you are, how you're the strongest, the greatest, the best hero ever. At the climatic end of the game, mild spoilers, you unleash your power and become even more overpowered compared to the actual superheroes. It become almost pointless to play a card for any other than Hunter in this battle which is so frustrating. Is this what I want from a game about superheroes? No, I want to play the superhero characters I know and love not some Mary Sue nonsense facsimile of a hero. Moreover The Hunter has no discernible character other than being the best at everything. She is the child of a demon which is never made into a relatable human problem about relationships with family you're just asked to understand what its like to be the child of a demon. The Hunter's voice acting is also terrible. The writing may not have been salvageable but the voice acting does it absolutely no favours. (I only played the female voiced Hunter, the male may be better?)

Overall this game is really hard to figure out. The licence has been dramatically underused, the writing is the worst I have seen in a game both for the dialogue and overall plot, the combat is fun if slightly undercooked, the heroes are brilliant in the combat half and awful in the everything else half. I finished the game and invested much more time than needed to do so, I spent far too much of that time aghast by how bad elements of the game were, I spent none of that time engaged with the game as anything other than an interesting deck building combat game. Ultimately I just can't recommend based the overwhelming flaws in the game and, in particular, the way these parts construct barriers to you playing the actually good parts.

I cannot recommend this game to anyone that isn't a Marvel fan, and even Marvel fans should wait until the game is on sale and I would highly recommend using mods to make the grind less unbearable.

I've played, and enjoyed, this game for many hours... but I am a HUGE Marvel fan and just giddy whenever they reference the movies or comics, like Strange arguing that ""it's a cloak, not a cape"". The dialogue is extremely entertaining for anyone that enjoys Marvel, and the combat is surprisingly fun even though it's a ""turn-based tactical card game"". The heroes are all crazy overpowered compared to the basic Hydra and demon enemies, with ""elite"" enemies peppered throughout that can take a few hits before going down, and villains are all either boss or mini-boss fights.

If the entire game was *only* the between-mission dialogue and the combat, it would make for a short but very enjoyable game. The problem is RNG. The people at Firaxis clearly have a hard-on for RNG and think that the implementation of it doesn't detract from their games they make but instead adds replayability because ""no two campaigns will be exactly the same!"" That's cool for games like This War Of Mine where a complete playthrough takes like 2-4 hours and the RNG elements are varied enough that the game is actually *different* each playthrough. But the RNG here is all about ""loot boxes"" and getting good rolls on the cards contained in them. Then there's RNG on getting doubles of the good cards, because you need to combine 2 identical cards to upgrade them! Then once you upgrade a card, you can apply ""mods"" to them (draw 1, +1 move, +1redraw, free, etc.) by spending resources... but when you mod a card, it's again random what mods you get to choose from--3 options selected randomly, you must spend increasing resources for each consecutive reroll, and it's taken anywhere from 1 to 47 rerolls to get the mod I want (no shit, forty-seven rerolls to get ""Draw 2 Cards on KO"" on one card).

The RNG is because Firaxis originally planned on giving the game an online real-money store where players could pay-to-win and buy the resources needed to mod their cards and get the perfect combinations. It's clear that they were going to monetize loot boxes and have in-game purchases because there are literally like 8 different types of currencies in the game. The only games that have that many types of currencies are ones that have plans on selling one or more of them as ""premium currencies"". They only changed gears when they caught a lot of flak from fans during development.

Because the game was clearly created to be a pay-to-win cash grab, it still very much plays like that's the case... but because they changed directions on the pay-to-win part and you can't actually buy any of the currencies, the game is just an absolute nightmare of a grind. Throw the ridiculous DRM those pieces of shit put in it which causes the game to crash if it detects CheatEngine or any other hacking software running at the same time regardless whether it's actually modifying the game process... it's a SINGLE-PLAYER ONLY GAME!!?!?!?!?! That is unbelievably grindy! And they won't let players just edit their currency values to play the fucking game and reduce their grind. That's beyond shady. And shitty.

The *ONLY* saving grace, and the *ONLY* reason I've actually managed to play the game is through a combination of save scumming to circumvent the shit RNG and using game mods. Because for whatever reason, you can modify the game you just can't modify the game while it's running? NexusMods has a ton of quality of life mods people have released to cut down on the grind by forcing the missions to give way more resources, eliminating shitty card mods from the RNG pool, modifying the shitty RNG to make all card mods have an equal chance of occurring, increasing Friendship XP gains, adding a damn map icon for the cat, and so much more. 

Those game mods are the only reason I've played more than a couple hours of this game. Without the game mods, the game is lukewarm garbage. Not quite hot garbage, but it's close.",1687964581,1689674262,False,3,0,0.470588237047195435,0,True,False,False

Big regrets buying this game I thought was X-COM with superheroes and turns out is a Marvel Dating Sim with a (decent) card battle mini-game we rarely get a chance to enjoy. The cut-scenes and friendship stuff absolutely dominates the game time. I feel mis-sold, a shame as I rarely pay over £20 for a game nowadays. Wish I got Aliens Dark Descent instead, at least that has consistent action.

UPDATE: So I played the 80+ hours it takes to finish the story in this game, it's okay. Once you get past the barrage of cut-scenes in the first few hours and learn to skip dialogue it gets quicker - but still not to a great degree. This game elbows you into creating a pretty monotonous Day/Night routine order (wake up, pet dog, talk to characters lit on map, unlock coils, upgrade abilities, etc, etc - E V E R Y game day) to try and maximise your characters. Fans of the game keep saying ""just ignore the relationships"" but you won't unlock skills, technology or items that will make it possible to get through as difficulty ramps up, and plus the skills are a big part of the FUN PART of this game, the action.

I eventually got it during the summer sale and I really enjoyed it, however, I do need to say, the beginning of the game is bad... very bad.

It's front loaded with cutscene after cutscene when all you want to do is play the damned card game. The cutscenes do dry up as you do more missions and after a few hours it becomes tolerable, but the pacing in the beginning of the game is horrendous. They really should have made you do several general missions and after each mission, they should have popped a cutscene. Instead they decided to dump 12 cutscenes on you just as you begin the game. The dialogue is cheesy, the characters don't feel compelling in the beginning and you will reach a point where you just start skipping lines. The story does eventrually get to a point where it becomes interesting and you actually start caring about the characters, but boy, does it  take its sweet time getting there.

Gameplaywise, I think it's great the animations are fantastic and every hit feels impactful. While there is not a huge amount of variety when it comes to cards for each character, you can upgrade and add modifiers to your cards... kind of how it is in diablo 3, so you can create some interesting combinations that way. There is also a... walking simulator game in here. You can explore the abbey grounds in order to get blessings from 4 gods, which are basically ""open this different type of barrier"", but these blessings also manifest in the form of very potent cards in the final encounter. I do believe this walking sim bit is optional. And finally there is the friendship sim/mass effect bit where you go around the ship.... uhhh, abbey and talk to everyone. There is even a sort of paragon/renegade system which is also affected by which cards your MC plays. With regards to the talking parts, some bits are interesting, some not so much, and some carry on a little longer than they should have.

All in all, I really enjoyed the game. Maybe I will give it another playthrough either on new game plus or when the season pass is back on sale. Looking forward to the sequel if it gets one.",1689538455,1689538561,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The battle system is pretty novel, and shows some promise, but any joy that may be found in the battles is constantly interrupted by an extraordinarily awful story and writing requiring more ""skip cutscene"" clicks than turns you'll even find yourself in in combat. The base management portion of the game forces you to run around in a ham-fisted 3D world, checking every corner for a glut of different currencies, each of which incrementally moves you towards getting a single new card.

Every level plays almost identically, being a big square with a similar handful of environmental objects. The heroes all do play fairly differently, but because the levels and challenges are all nearly identical you have to homogenize their decks so they can solve the same generic challenges which really takes an edge off the game

Marvel's Midnight Suns has been an extraordinary journey over the 110+ hours I've invested in it. It is an amalgamation of poignant storytelling, thrilling gameplay mechanics, and an immersive universe that has left me incredibly impressed. This game is a testament to the fact that superheroes are more than their powers; they're beings of depth, with stories to tell and demons to face.

In terms of storytelling, the writers have truly outdone themselves. The narratives they weave through each mission, side-quest, and character interaction are not only compelling but imbued with a deep sense of relatability. The developers have taken familiar characters and placed them in a narrative that is engaging, surprising, and consistently satisfying, bringing depth and personality to each hero. The dialogue is wonderfully written and serves as a testament to the skill and care put into every narrative detail.

Every mission in the game feels like a chapter from a gripping novel. From meeting The Hunter (Your custom Hero) and rescuing specific characters from the villain Lilith's clutches, researching Marvel Artifacts and plot points, to the emotional turmoil of the final mission, each chapter of the game's story is full of suspense, emotional depth, and unexpected twists. The evolving relationships among the characters and the deepening plot create a narrative tapestry that tugs at the heartstrings and keeps you at the edge of your seat.

The gameplay mechanics of Marvel's Midnight Suns are equally impressive. The battle system is deep, strategic, and consistently rewarding. The mechanic of being able to rotate squads mid-fight in the final mission is a masterstroke of design, adding layers of complexity to the encounters. The unique Midnight Suns cards associated with each character's armor bring game-changing moves to the battlefield, ramping up the tension and excitement. Each character is nuanced in their abilities, requiring strategy and skill to maximize their effectiveness in battle.

Moreover, the game's attention to the environment and how it can be utilized to control the battlefield is commendable. It encourages a level of strategic thinking that is often missing from games of this genre. The fact that your friendship levels impact your abilities in the final battle is a great touch that deepens the bond between players and their characters.

The post-credit scenes are the perfect cherry on top, providing just enough intrigue to leave players eagerly anticipating what's to come. The introduction of Doctor Doom in the epilogue promises even more enthralling narratives and battles in the future.

Marvel's Midnight Suns is a masterclass in game design and storytelling. It excels in its narrative depth, character development, and gameplay mechanics, delivering a thrilling superhero experience that resonates long after the final credits roll. If you're a fan of the Marvel universe, strategic RPGs, or engaging narratives, this game is a must-play. It has been an absolute joy to share my gameplay experiences on my YouTube channel and engage with a community as passionate about this game as I am. Here's to many more hours of Marvel's Midnight Suns! Firaxis, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make another one.

The combat is amazing. It plays more like a card game than a TRPG. It eliminates que most frustrating parts of XCOM combat, such as hit chance and sometimes distance management. The combat is set up in a way your super heroes feel like, well, super heroes.

The relationship part is cool. Pretty much like a persona game, after almost every day, you get the chance to hangout with some characters. But you don't really hangout with heroes, you hangout with people. So you can really start to feel close to certain characters during the campaing. However, by the end of the game, there were too many characters and I felt a bit dettached from most of the roster.

The characters are varied and all play uniquely different in combat, but are hit-or-miss in terms of presentation. You'll have Wolverine and Sabretooth feel straight out of the comics, while Iron Man is bargain bin Robert Downey Jr. and Captain Marvel lacks any and all personality whatsoever. Also the main character (The Hunter) is the most boring excuse of a ""Commander""-type PC that I've experienced in a while.
As for costumes, aside from the Hunter, you can only unlock one new costume per character through leveling their friendship (in my 54 hour playtime I only unlocked one). The other two costumes available for each character are real money purchases (through buying premium credits). All of the loot chests in the hub world are pretty much for color swaps for the default costumes, and once you have all of those, you'll eventually get nothing from opening them. Most of the costumes themselves are pretty good, but you start to notice issues with the character models when they're in their casual clothes (Wolverine's jpeg body hair, for example). Also, there are swimsuits for some reason.

The game brings to life the characters we've all seen on the big screen to the characters who have barely seen the limelight.
With the game's focus more on strategy, deck building and limited resources, the game plays more of an XCOM-like than a true hero beat-em-up which feels refreshing compared to other superhero games that have been released.

The combat does get sidelined by dialogue and relationships which to me was amazing.
The best part of a game where you get to basically insert an OC is to just be able to hang out with all your favourite superheroes from genius, billionaire Tony Stark to angsty, emo Illyana Rasputin and learn more about their personalities and stories that you don't really get to see in movies and tv shows.

If you are here to buy this game just to see your favourite heroes fight then you're in the wrong place.

Some really in depth strategy and hero customization options.  The core game play loop is a lot of fun and very engaging.  Choosing the appropriate heroes to bring as part of your squad based on the mission type is clutch.  The card deck mechanic is a fun way to control your team and plan how you want to approach the battle.  Also some of the boss battles and main missions are a lot of fun.  It also goes deep into the comic lore.  If you're an old school comics Marvel nerd like I am, you will find a lot of fun Easter eggs and references that will delight.  Finally the voice acting is top notch including some actors reprising their roles in video game form with characters like Nico and Wolverine (cartoon voice actor, not Hugh Jackman.)   The writing as well is very MCU quippy, and can actually be pretty funny in spots.

Cons:

The non-missions can be quite the grind.  You have the abbey which is your base that you explore and expand on with side missions, collectibles, and optional missions.  This ""find the 4 things to unlock the main thing, which lets you get to the next thing"" is extremely dull.  Fortunately you can skip these if you like, but some of the perks make it worth doing.  Things like special card abilities or optional cards.  Also while the voice acting is good, everyone can be VERY chatty.  They will tell you their life story if you let them.  You can skip past some of these if you would like.  Some of them are actually interesting and well acted, but when it goes full super hero dating sim it does get weird.  Finally the enemy variety is a bit limited.  It's a few super villains, and by a few I mean 3 main ones and then 2 ""turned"" heroes.  And then 2 enemy types, Hydra units, and fallen demon type units of which there are a few variants.   

Overall: 

I'm well over 100 hours into this game with my second play through and very much enjoy the bulk of the game.  I wish it did better financially so we could see a sequel and really grow the game out more.  Maybe we'll get lucky in that regard.

Here's the thing: I don't know how to start this, because pretty much every aspect of the game can be summed as ""it's alright, but..."". There isn't *the* worst aspect of the game, but, by the same token, I'd be hard-pressed to come up with something that didn't have some frustrating bits to it.

I suppose I can try to summarize what this game even is. It is, at its core, a turn-based tactical combat game combined with a card game. You enter (most) combats with three characters. You start with a number of cards randomly drawn from their combined pools and each turn you can play three cards. Normal cards give you heroism points; heroic cards and environmental attacks spend them. Then the enemies take their turn, but they instead each make an attack. Of course, in practice, this is a lot more complex, which gives a lot of tactical options, while still forcing you to rely at least a little bit on luck, but that's the main idea.

And that system can be pretty satisfying when you execute a plan perfectly, especially when you manage to KO every enemy before they even had a chance to act. It's clear that a lot of thought went into it, with different victory conditions, different enemy abilities and properties, etc. The default difficulty seems fit even for people who aren't very good at tactical games, like me, and while you can't start on harder difficulties on your first playthrough, they get unlocked pretty fast and you can switch to them, should you so desire.

Unfortunately, it seems that little else received even close to that amount of attention. There is no other real gameplay other than this, despite the combats being only half of the supposed game process: after each mission, you return to the ""base"" location, where you can talk to the other characters, explore the grounds, solve some puzzles, unlock some chests, get new costume options and color palettes for them, etc, etc, but I hesitate to call any of this actual ""gameplay"", at least it's no more gameplay than a walking simulator.

The dialogue between the characters ranges from okay to ""worst parts of Marvel movies"", and it doesn't help that most of it takes place with them in generic idle animations, even in some supposedly manually-directed cutscenes. The characters have very little chance to shine and develop outside of you pestering them by hanging out with them and giving them gifts, which is a shame because when some attempt at developing them is made, it's usually pretty good.

Of course, I also have to mention the main storyline. It exists. It's precisely as bland as you would expect. Bad evil person is destroying the world, we gotta stop that.

There are, unfortunately, some performance issues and bugs, ranging from hilarious, like characters showing up in cutscenes in their swimwear, to annoying (saving the game can take several minutes sometimes for seemingly no reason), to ""why the hell has this not been fixed"", like the reward for finishing up the exploration of the main base just failing to appear where it should.

The graphics are both pretty nice and outdated at the same time. The environments clearly had a lot of love poured into them, which is especially odd for a game where you spend most of the time hovering 5 meters above everything, but people look a bit... plastic-y. The lack of directed and individually animated cutscenes doesn't help. The parts I liked the most in terms of art direction were the hand-drawn effects, but they were so rare it almost seems like a relic from an earlier iteration of the development process.

The voice performances were mostly alright, though I have to say, I really disliked the way the main protagonist is so blandly unemotional most of the time. This was probably the direction, so I don't blame the VAs, but, unfortunately, listening to their voice is kinda what you do for half of the game, so...

Lastly, I enjoyed the DLC characters and their side storyline, though it didn't fit into the main story *entirely* well, with some characters ending up being introduced twice and such.",1689190958,1689190958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a bit of exploration on some beautifully designed areas, there's a Persona-style relationship game, and a fun, approachable deck building game. All wrapped up around a neat story and likable, fully voiced protagonist that feels pulled straight from the pages of some of my favorite comic titles of my youth.

I bought this on a steam sale expecting to get 20 or so hours of distraction out of it, and after 90 hours of my first play through, I'm now gleefully diving into my second with the DLC. 

10/10.

Just a really fun game to play. My only criticism is that the first three hours or so are definitely the weakest, which is unfortunate, since most people will probably do their two hour Steam return by then.

More Details:

Every hero has their own deck and cards, and they really do a fantastic job of making each hero's deck and play style, ""feel like them"". Playing Iron Man feels like you're manipulating mechanics, Playing Strange feels like you're building up mana and power. Playing Magik feels like you're playing with portals (""Is portal!"") and throwing bad guys around. It's great, and I never felt like there was a hero I wasn't that interested in exploring the game play for.

I was really blown away by some of the voice performances. Tony Stark is fucking Tony Stark man, with all his arrogance, charm, and - sometimes, earnest sincerity. Steve Rodgers is Captain America because He's Steve Rodgers, not because he's on the Super Solider Serum. Are they all stellar? No, but they are all distinct and entertaining. I even got a little teary in some places. 

These are not the MCU heroes, but they *are* Heroes, and you believe them.

Do yourself a favor and get this game if you at all enjoy any of those things.",1689177804,1689177804,True,13,1,0.598460733890533447,0,True,False,False

I greatly enjoyed the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games and probably went into Midnight Suns with an attitude expecting the same. I’ve been told the game is very much like an Xcom game. 

The voice acting was superb. Matthew Mercer voices the male Hunter and Laura Bailey voices Magik (my favorite X-men character). I wasn’t a fan of Storm’s voice actress, but nothing tops X-men TAS Storm. I also thought Agatha’s voice actress was a strange choice. I found myself quoting her regularly in the same tones (“Hunter, hello!”), and that isn’t a compliment. Otherwise, they all fit their characters perfectly. Even Iron Man sounded absolutely perfect for the role. I read somewhere that Hunter is hard to like, but I loved her by the middle of the game. Her stilted way of speaking and formality definitely improve over the game, and the other characters balance her out. At times some sounds like Venom’s wet attacks were a little much. The battle music was always overpowering and anxiety building. 

The character design definitely isn’t top tier, but it’s fine with the customization. I found Iron Man’s mustache and Captain Marvel’s hair the hardest to deal with. I did like the amount of costume choices and color palettes. Hunter’s Abbey outfits were hit or miss and she should’ve definitely had more customization options. 

The story itself is good. You’ve been revived to stop the BBEG again: your mom. By the end of the game I expected the story twist but not the mechanics twist. Without spoiling it I will say it was fantastic and made the end battle pretty great. The game is very heavy on the magical lore, which is where it lost me a bit. I also didn’t feel emotionally attached to anyone in the game. Building friendships with characters is fun but if you pick the wrong choices in interactions their dislike and following rudeness is a little much. 

Gameplay is enjoyable. It a predictable pattern: during the day time you go to the Forge (“Welcome to big Tony’s demon cave. I’m Tony, how can I assist you today?”) and work with Dr. Strange and Iron Man, spar with heroes, send heroes on missions, update your cards, talk to heroes and help them, and buy gifts. Don’t forget to pet the dog!! Once you go to work (your daily mission) it’s then evening where you may be able to hang out with a hero and improve your friendships or go to club activities (not as weird as it sounds). I liked that as there were some I genuinely enjoyed hanging with while others were bottom tier. I also liked that your alignment and choices impacted your friendships. At any time you can explore the grounds and uncover “mysteries”. That gets the quotations because most can be solved with the different keywords (especially Reveal). 

A few issues: some of the characters I hadn’t unlocked would show up where they shouldn’t have been. For example, a character was being manipulated by the BBEG and was super evil… but they were posting on our closed network Superlink (Twitter for the Abbey). Another time during the main storyline another DLC character was just hanging out with us, despite him never being mentioned in game at all. Also, I played on the Steamdeck and the game tended to crash during main storyline battles. I also couldn’t reroll any secondary ability mods. And finally I think I somehow glitched out of a certain mini boss battle because one minute we were fighting him and building up for it and the next he was just gone, literally never mentioned again.

(also, i fell asleep for 6 hours, so my game time is only 18 at the time of this review)

but something about playing with Marvel characters just reminds me of the shows i grew up on, member-berries you got us again...

however it's not terrible... a pretty stable game, although running feels a bit funny... but i guess that makes it realistic, i do have some FPS issues (rarely), but i think that's my PC doing something in the background.

Also, even on normal mode you can fail pretty easy at the battle if you choose the wrong move 4 times in a row, lol, it was on accident twice though! but that's the beauty of games like this, you can take it slow, instead of button mash like a lunatic.

To be honest, as well rounded as this Diamond in the Rough is, the tipping point was Michael Jai White as Blade, i was having a really hard time deciding until i finally noticed i know that voice, i'm a big fan of Spawn (and he's a pretty talented actor). 

...there's only one thing i would really change, FanService: i like the show Archer and all of it's music, lol.... i look forward to seeing Archer and Lana show up in the sequel, hopefully Spawn and The Witcher can also make an appearance.... but okay, i also need to add, the RENT is too darn high, and so is the pricing around here! i did 40% but i understand why you would buy this on a 75% sale. 8.0/10.0 though (if you love Marvel characters ...of old... and videogames)

sidenote: i always assume games get more unstable overtime though, bugs can often arise around the end of the game.

2nd sidenote: i cant really speak of the difficulty, i played in normal and i'm a totally noob in this genre, i've only played the FF series, BattlestarGalactica & Xcom2 (for 1 free weekend)... anyways, this reminds me of Final Fantasy, so enjoy it or dont.

edit: the fans whining about not knowing who The Hunter is... you can't be a real SpiderMan fan like that guy who watched the films almost 300 times in the theater, almost every real fan of Marvel knows who Hunter is.

Those complaining about the way the game is paced slowly by going through animations... it's like you never played any card games(IRL), they are slow, you know? also, just touch grass, make tea, scratch it and move your body... nobody asked you to stare at the screen for ''30 seconds'' when IronMan does his attacks.

April 2023Edit: Never forget settings can ruin the camera angles, like i keep forgetting.

Also, not a big fan of the 2K launcher after using it for a month or 2... And my Computer crashes a lot recently in-game.... When i load the first map of the day, 

Unhandled Exception EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION reading address0x000000000000000
MidnightSuns_Win64_Shipping

(i read somewhere and heard somewhere that there are problems with Unreal Engine4, i guess this is it...reading some reddit posts Windows11 is having this issue along with all other activate version)

this is an offline game...(but it works better without VPN for some reason) ALSO, some game/PC crashes are resolved by unplugging the internet (after the game loads), that's weird, UE4 is strange, after almost 300 hours of playing, i can say i still give this a solid 8.4 out of 10.

but people are right about the cosmetics being expensive for (almost) no reason & i rather buy the GamePass for 20 bucks, 40 is just not my thing, SOARING PRICES!!

Also Captain Marvel isn't woke...maybe 1 statement, but Capn America is definitely woke (like 5 times), but you can forgive him, always forgive papa Rogers.

2nd Edit: Curse Effigy is the only i card (combat item) that doesn't work...(or works improperly, For weeks i couldnt use the card at all, now it seems to effect 1 or 2 enemies... so there are flaws, i disagree with most negative reviews though)

lowering the graphics to the lowest & they still look great, but maybe it's a more fair review to say 8.1 overall score. this is a story from comic books & Every piece of art is its own thing... So character stories are important here. 
Also, i heard the game has like 50,000 pieces (lines?) of dialogue, so someone else beat me to exposing the typos but it doesn't matter since there are only 2 text flaws which i have found. objectively it's a good game... i mean you got gold friendship levels, that's more combat boosts!! i recommend buying all of it for 50 bucks (or under), yup... but i havent tested the DLC characters yet... waiting for Storm and a massive sale, #GetGud",1676871410,1689092919,True,2,0,0.518079578876495361,0,True,False,False

All I knew was that I tend to eventually get bored with tactical, turn-based battle games (even ones with mechanics I otherwise enjoy, like Planetfall and Age of Wonders 4), so it didn't make sense for me to shell out the cash. 

I was wrong. If you're waffling on whether to pick this one up, I definitely recommend giving it a try. If you need the 4-hour grace period to check to see whether it's your cup of tea, just use ""Esc"" to fast-forward through cut-scenes, then go back and watch them later if you like it and decide to keep it.

This game has some amazingly fun mechanics that make it worth checking out, even if you often get bored with turn-based tactical games. The card-drawing mechanic gives a controllable RNG that both keeps things from getting stale while also adding an additional level of strategy as you acquire more cards... you wind up not only focusing on building the 'best deck' for each player, but also customizing decks that work best with specific combos of characters. There are a zillion different ways to tweak the cards and battles, as well: craftable rescue cards, card upgrades and card mods and upgraded card mods, passives based on how friendly your character is with the others, super-fun combo 'finishing' moves... 

The RPG aspect is the weak point (the need to make friends means that actually role-playing will lock you out of key benefits), but I still think it's a lot of fun. And while the intro may be a slog to get through for a second run (I love the cut scenes and conversations, I really do, but there are an awful lot when you first start), I can also see some space for replayability already... and I'm only in the first act. 

So if you're here for a sale, I'd recommend picking it up and giving it a try. If it's full-price and you can spare the cash, I do think it's worth it.

Midnight Suns has a fair amount of bloat and game mechanics that I feel like detract somewhat from the whole rather than add to it. Let me say that this game is heavily reminiscent of XCOM. This is a good thing. While crafting weapons and equipment for your soldiers is an important strategic decision point, I never wanted to run around in 3rd person to collect materials. This game also does away with the grid system which makes it feel much more fluid, but makes positioning feel a bit finicky and somewhat less tactical.

The Marvel aspect of the game adds a lot of depth and gives you an immediate attachment to the characters, but also hamstrings a lot of aspects. Part of what makes XCOM fun is the brutality of permadeath. What sacrifices will you make to save your favorite soldier? But since these are all Marvel superheroes you can't have them die. The game has injuries and such for heroes that take too much damage, but it's pretty inconsequential. Also, you ""K.O."" the enemy soldiers and vampires and such. Which is a joke in and of itself. Blade just shot a guy with an SMG, he's dead, not knocked out. 

Honestly though those are all pretty superficial complaints. The 3rd person BS is the worst part, but you can take it in small doses. 

The gameplay is pretty fantastic though. It's a deckbuilder and you play cards just like most card games, but it's not just mana called something else. The game starts out pretty easy but once you can increase the difficulty it becomes more challenging. The heroes have pretty strong identities in terms of their abilities and I like playing with most if not all of them.

And while I can see why some would complain about the style of the game, I can see what they were going for. This is exactly how super hero teams operate, especially in the Marvel world.

There is a base of operations with soap opera drama and interpersonal team dynamics at play, and the team periodically get sent out on missions, some of those related to the main super villain and main story, and some related to personal team member stories. They have a practice area and a large base. Etc etc.

I will say it can feel a bit slow, has an odd choice of a niche team as the focus (the Suns, though the roster is certainly not skimpy), the missions seem quite shallow and don't appear to be multi stage so far, card management can be a bit fickle, some weird design decisions like multiple currencies that are a grind to get, and writing that can be a bit juvenile (though have you read marvel comics? They have always had teenagey and cringe level writing - you get used to it.)

I think it's great that they tried something different, and I feel they were very close to nailing the vibe they intended (you are a super-hero living the life of a hero in a team of heroes). Perhaps 40% less interpersonal mini-games, and 40% more actual combat would have improved this game significantly.

However, I actually like really the game despite the flaws, and it does feel like you're living in a comic book. If you don't mind a lot of down time between missions and engaging with each character's story through lots of fully voiced dialogue chains, you will really enjoy this.",1688867020,1688867020,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

They spent a massive amount of resources, time, and money on the dialogue part of the game with voice actors etc..., even after completing the main story, I still get new dialogue from characters every single in game day!. 

its really unfortunate that the devs did not rather spent those resources focusing on the main story and combat gameplay, making the main campaign longer, more enemies, more enemy heroes to fight etc... the game would have been really great.

PROS

Marvel roster: a great, if really odd mix, of characters. Some are the 'big name' individuals the Marvel cinematic universe made so popular (Tony, Steve, Strange). Others are lesser known (Nico, Magik, Robbie Reyes). Either way, it's a wide mix of individuals who you don't usually see get to work together so that, in and of itself, is fairly interesting.

Card Buidling: Honestly thought I would hate this aspect, but it's one of the things I enjoy the most. Being able to create a deck (aka build) for each character is a lot of fun, especially when you start synergizing it with the rest of the three man team. There's a lot of room for flexibility and while each character semi falls into the 'holy trinity' of RPGs (healer, tank, dps) there is far more crossover than usual.

Animations: Fantastic in combat. Spells and abilities look great and characters have great style when executing them. Legendary abilities are especially fantastic and give off the same vibe you get when pulling a summon out in FF VII. 

A different spin on mission types: look, at the end of the day the mission style is very much that tried and true formula brought from the Xcom franchise. Protect this, extract with this, kill all enemies. But there are some nice variations here, most notably with things like the Nest Mother and environmental combos. It's not going to make the genre do a complete 180, but it's nice to see something beyond the 'shoot this barrel to go boom' simplicity.

Music: great music selection that meshes well with the things going on onscreen. I think we all knew that was going to be a strong point the minute we saw the first trailer.


MEH

Voice Acting: Can be both good and bad. Gave this a meh rating because I don't think it primarily the voice actors issue here. There are some that are a little flat, but most put on a solid performance. It's just a shame the writing is so bad (more to follow on that). 

Costumes and Customization: They aren't horrendous here, but it's really restrictive for an RPG style romp, imo. Granted, you don't want to have established characters breaking the lore by wearing wild stuff, but I would have appreciated more customization of the OCs outfits and more than 2-3 choices for each of the established heroes. Plus, this is a superhero game. If you're going to be jumping into the arena of custom characters in superhero genre, you need to have something robust when it comes to character creation. 

Abbey: I love the Abbey in general as it feels less stuffy than the Sanctum and less over the top than Stark Tower. I also like the tie in to Salem, the witch hunts, and overbearing religion. It's kind of cool, but I do wish it went a little further in depth than just the journal pages you find lying around or the exploration parts. 


BAD

The Writing: while the main story isn't horrendous, it's your normal super hero/save the world affair, there is far to much time spent on building 'relationships' with all the characters. That in and of itself isn't a bad thing in an RPG. Mass Effect and Dragon age are exactly that and it's hard to find games that resonate so strongly with players when it comes to character relationship compared to those two. Here, the writing is just really bad. 

There are high points. Some interactions were a lot of fun. Being able to sit down and watch Blade, Steve Rogers, and Carol Danvers discuss the finer points of the ""Art of War' was kind of cool. Talking philosophy and the cycle of life and death with Dr Strange was unique. Even theory crafting with Eddie Brock on what it would be like to fight a T-Rex was kind of funny. But the majority (I'd say at least 80% of the interactions) are hack writing. 

Most of them devolve into the established character telling the OC they've 'never connected with someone until they met them' or 'you're such a great friend'.. Never mind that all the Marvel characters have been on multiple teams, hundreds of times in the past, or that the OC is the stiffest and most unlikable of the bunch  (so the simple concept that EVERYONE connects with them is highly laughable). Most of the interactions will be like that. Eye rolling, sub par writing with dumb comments thrown in (Captain Marvel just couldn't help herself and had to talk about 'shattering the glass ceiling' even while laying outside and staring at the stars). It's frustrating because it could have been so much better and this game could have been another Dragon Age level title. But writers are hacks these days it seems, in almost all mediums.

The OC: I hate this person. Look, the story behind them and what they're supposed to do is solid. But damn if they aren't written like a complete twat. Yeah, they have a moment of funny dialogue or something which hits a high point, but they're so stiff in this odd attempt to pull the 'fish out of water' trope. Since you're essentially playing this character, it drags everything down.

Open World (Abbey): my god, I'm not sure who decided this was a good idea. The Abbey serves as the 'base setting' for your squad, very similar to the hovercraft in XCOM. Only issue is, they tied this weird open world mechanic into it where you have to run around to collect materials for upgrades and investigate the Abbey grounds. I can see what they were going for, and it may have even worked, if it wasn't so shallow and half ass executed. Instead, it feels like a tacked on feature, that didn't have enough time dedicated to it to develop properly. So instead of adding intrigue and suspense, it's simply tedious and atrocious. 

They should have left it out and streamlined the game a bit more. As it is now, you'll spend some of the early hours exploring the hell out of it, forget about it for 10 missions, then get sent back out to explore the same areas you already have. It's kind of annoying and god help you if you love to burn through items in combat. You're going to need those mats since each item is 'one use only' and I don't envy anyone who has to farm for them.


CONCLUSION

Overall, I'll give this a recommend, especially when it's on sale. I've been fairly apathetic towards the Marvel IP for years (since WandVision turned out to be a dud) because of the way Disney has run it into the ground. But this game helped remind me why I grew up loving these characters so much. 

While there is definitely some points I would suggest Firaxis leaves out or improves (drop the open world mat farming and hire some decent writers instead of the randos simply sitting in a starbucks) the card building style and combat was a breath of fresh air. It had just enough randomization to keep combat interesting, tempered with allowing the player just enough control so it doesn't feel cheap or ridiculous. I had, and am having a good time with the title, even with it's glaring flaws.",1688496916,1688663566,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

You fight in teams of three in a strategy game style format minus the archetypal grid. Each character has a set of unique cards that represent their powers and are drawn which make up your moves and can be enhanced or replaced along the way.  When the battle ends you spend nights at the keep  relationship building with various team members in a style I'm told is similar to the Persona series. In the morning you do training, light crafting, and some quests unlocking the areas around the keep itself before going back to battle.  Rinse.  Repeat.  That's the game.

One of my friends had the valid criticism that he found some characters annoyingly edgey and their dialogue started to grate on his nerves.  Fortunately, there is a large cast and you can avoid most NPCs.

The dynamics with the other heroes are nothing new (build relationships with them, get positive outcomes), but I also feel compelled and excited about leveling up those relationships.

I'm sure that the DLCs add some extra variety to the game but honestly even what was present in the base game still felt pretty good.

It definitely wasn't perfect, but what we got was something that deserves a sequel. In the same way that, IMO, XCOM 2 improved well upon the formula of XCOM 1, I believe a MS2 could be a better version of this.

If you're a Marvel fan, I think this is even more of a joy. There's lots of references to enjoy within the game in various forms, from name drops of different characters, collectibles of vintage comic books, to character cosmetics that reference different versions of the available roster, there's a treasure trove of ""oh cool!"" moments to be had for fans. It's clear that the people who made this game either were Marvel fans or at the very least made sure to do their homework to deliver an authentic Marvel video game experience.

There are some things they could have done better for sure, I think some character balance was off and some of the RPG elements felt rough, but at the end of the day what I played was a polished experience that by all accounts should have done way better commercially than it did.

Now for some scores:

[h1]Story - 7/10[/h1]
It's kind of campy but that fits in well with a super hero storyline. You've got an apocalypse looming on the horizon and you, The Hunter, are prophesied to play a key role in it. You're accompanied by two main hero groups: The Avengers, the veteran apocalypse-averting crew we all know, and the Midnight Suns, a group of (mostly) young blood who've been united as a team specifically to help fight off the forces of Lilith. You'll meet up with some extra characters too, especially with the DLC, but beyond that you maintain a core group of just a dozen or so characters that you'll take on missions and become friends with. Honestly, I really enjoyed the story but it's got the typical amount of required hand-wavey-ness that most super hero stories require you to undergo in order for it to fit together, so it certainly isn't a masterpiece.

[h1]Gameplay - 8/10[/h1]
It is, at the same time, less and more tactical than other games in the same genre. You forgo the typical battle map with cover, flanking, and Overwatching-All-The-Time and replace it with environmental hazards and a card battle system. With only (typically) 3 card plays per turn though, sometimes your favorite characters can end up just sitting there looking pretty if you just don't draw their cards, which feels bad. Also unless you have certain characters in your party, the environmental hazards can sometimes just be too difficult to incorporate into your battle strategy. But with the way it is built, it works well, and that's valuable in it's own right.

[h1]Sound - 7/10[/h1]
Pretty basic sound design, but I give props to the voice acting. The characters all sounded perfect to me. I don't know if these people have played these characters in other media, but they knocked it out of the ballpark here. 

[h1]Graphics - 6/10[/h1]
In some ways they did really well and in others it could use more work. During cutscenes, there's a weird out-of-focus issue when it is focused on a character's face where the character is blurry but the background is in focus. Also the world details were pretty sparse. The battlemaps you play on are very barebones. The cutscenes seem to be pre-rendered, so if you're playing on highest graphics the cutscenes are actually downgraded. All in all it could be improved upon but it doesn't look bad.

[h1]Performance - 8/10[/h1]
I didn't play this game on release, so I'm sure there were stability patches that made my experience much smoother than it would have been for people on release, but I can't change that so all I can say is that it ran pretty great more or less. There was some issues, like if I moved a lot of characters around at once it could get really confused as to what to do. The final mission also started really wigging out on me for a bit (a save and reload fixed it). But I can't say I can complain too much here.

[h1]Overall - 7/10[/h1]
I definitely recommend it if you're a fan of tactical turn based games or superhero games. There's multiple difficulty settings as well to make it fit your desired challenge, and the only thing that affects is how much ""gloss"" you get as a reward per mission (a resource used to buy some home base outfits and combat outfit colors for your roster of characters, aka cosmetics). There are some outfits for the characters that require either the season pass or premium currency to acquire which I'm not a huge fan of, but by the end of the game I had everyone decked out in their Midnight Suns outfits so the premium cosmetics are very avoidable IMO. I haven't bought any of the DLC as previously mentioned, mostly because the given price point seems high IMO. I can't comment on it other than that. The base game though is definitely worth it, especially if it's on any kind of sale.",1688517549,1688518052,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros

Intuitiveness
I love how simple it is to understand what is going to happen in combat and what each card does. Everything is clear and effects are well explained.

Difficulty Levels
I think when you find the right difficulty level you do have a chance of losing some of the harder missions.

Heroes
The Heroes are awesome. Its the reason I bought the game and I am not disappointed. The characters are so unique and well written. The playstyles are quite unique as well. While there is a good bit of crossover, some characters have very specific mechanics. Take Deadpool for example - his ""on fuego""mechanic snowballs KOs into more damage; however when he takes damage, he loses one level of ""on feugo"". This forces you to have to keep him from taking damage, to keep him as max effectiveness. This is absolutely the best part of the game. The flavor you get from combat is welcome. Each move gets it's own animation, and they are very exciting and unique. 

Deckbuilding & Combat
This is the core of the game. Without it, this would be a dating simulator. The decks have three different types of abilities - Attack, Skill, and Heroic. You get a 8 cards to a deck, needing at least one of each and no more than 4 of any one type. Heroic cards require you to build up a heroics meter by playing non heroic cards. While everyone has these three types of cards, the effects or attack methods require you to think about your hero composition. For instance, ""quick"" allows you to refund the card play upon KO. However, they do low damage and aren't as effective against stronger opponents. Without any ""quick"" cards, you may find yourself running out of card plays in any single round. There are also environmental attacks, too. You can throw someone into an explosive barrel, which sets off an explosive AOE. Or you can pull a lamp post down onto someones head. Very fun and rewarding. 

Voice Acting
While the friendship system isn't my favorite and the dialogue can be a bit so-so at times, the voice acting is insanely good. Although the actors from the movies don't voice them (duh), the ones in the game get close enough to not feel wrong, but different enough to not feel like someones doing a bad impression. I think the worst one so far is Deadpool. He seems a little Gilford Godfrey-esque.

Costumes
These are sick. I love customization and they have different costumes that you can gradually unlock (street clothes and super suits). Reminds me of the comics when they would go through shifts.

Light/Dark System
During dialogue, you sometimes get the option to give multiple options - one that's more positive, one more negative, and a neutral one. The way you answer these prompts will affect which cards you get for you character, hunter.

CONS


Friendship System
Each hero has a friendship meter that the game strongly encourages you to fill. It doesn't have a large impact on the game yet seems to be a big part of the overall package. Sometimes the dialogue options seem like good ones to build on friendship, but end up doing the opposite. There is also a more confusing altogether friendship level you can have, this affects something known as combo cards. The friendship system is about a third of the game and for it to be on the cons side of this list - that's very not good.

Combos
This may be a bit of a nit pick, but we play superhero games for the element of cool. The animations for the combat is so good, except for this. After you gain a friendship level, the only bonus I've seen so far is it gives you combo cards in combat. These combo cards are good strategically, but really don't look good during the animation. It's fine, but combos of different heroes look the exact same as all the others. Unique combos would at least make the friendship system more bearable. I loved a game called ultimate alliance and one of the most memorable sections of that game was combo-ing with your teammates. Iron man would blast Captain Americas shield and it would refract into like 8 beams. Doing something like that would be cool. Even if the characters were on screen at the same time it would be an upgrade.

Enemy Types
You get 2 enemy types - minions and elites. These have a little bit of variance to what abilities they have (one has a shield, another a sniper), but they get pretty old, quick. There are some fights that have you fight vampyres, enemies that cause a bleed effect. These are cool and I would have liked more enemy types like that.

Agatha:
She feels misplaces. Like there is some science and mystical arts in this game, but the blue starwars ghost feels like it misses the tonality of the game. She also has a big quest line that has you go all over the abbot. it's pretty bad with a lot of dialogue. The rare godly trial fights are fun though. Idk if her story line ties into everything at the end or something. Where I at in the game, they could have scrapped that entire part too.

Pool
It's completely useless. It bugs me, don't know why. Gimme a mini-game or a tiny bonus before a fight like start with 5 shield your next battle. 

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Conclusion
It's fun, but not worth $60. I hope they introduce more enemy types, as then I think the combat would be excellent. I do enjoy Marvel and DC stuff, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. The Friendship system is pretty bad. Oh, and make the combos cooler, please. If I could go into a mode where I just did mission after mission and then unlocked new cards after every one with a cutscene thrown in every once in a while, I think this game would be so much better.

The game is divided 50/50, between days, in which you run around collecting upgrades and get to kill a few nazis, vampires, or nazi vampires, and night, in which you give people you just met expensive presents intimately tailored to their personalities after playing video games with them, and they somehow aren't weirded out by it.  Every few nights you also need to run around the woods picking mushrooms, finding Tarot cards, and generally doing season of the witch type stuff.  Hail Satan!

You have to constantly over-validate a passel of plucky goth kids so that they can better help you murder Nazis.  For example, if Ghostrider isn't regularly told that's he's doing a great job whipping Nazis with flaming chains while surfing the hood of a Dodge Charger from literal Hell, he'll get really mopey, and think he may not be living up to the sterling legacy of the original Ghostrider, Johnny Blaze, who is renowned for breaking the glass ceiling of white trash representation in comics.  To be fair, at one point you do watch Johnny defend what appears to be the Gathering of the Juggaloes from demons with some kind of infernal pump shotgun.  It's like if Rob Zombie was capable of coming up with something actually kinda rad.

Several marquee Avengers are also present here.  Steven Strange and Tony Stark are portrayed as a bickering old couple who are also narcissistic sociopaths, which I think is a braver writing choice than any made in the MCU. At one point, Steve Rogers is too sweet and sincere to understand that Blade is using Sun Tzu to cheaply hit on Captain Marvel, so you have to join a fake book club so it doesn't get too weird.  Eventually Wolverine also joins.  He doesn't do any of the reading though, cuz he's Wolverine, baby.    

You can even pay extra for a fabulous version of Morbius that is having a fantastic time prancing around in spandex and capes murdering people, presumably while listening to the Phantom of the Opera Broadway soundtrack on his earbuds.  Sony, take note of how Morbin' time should actually work.

It is pretty long at 115 hours to complete the main quest and DLC missions with most of the legendary hero abilities unlocked. If you like turn based tactics games and Marvel characters you'll probably really like it too. It definitely nails that whole “combat puzzle” vibe that really good turn-based games like XCOM, Fire Emblem, Into the Breach and Gears Tactics have but in a completely different way mechanically. Each character plays very distinctly and different team compositions add a lot of variety to how you approach things. It uses cards to represent abilities, but it's not a card battler. There's no ""AI deck"" that you are going against. You eventually get the ability to upgrade and apply randomized modifiers to cards, which can result in some fun/weird combinations and that is where the game really starts to shine. The base price is overpriced on Steam but I got the Legendary version with all the DLC when it was on sale for $50 and that feels reasonable and it seems to go on sale every other month.

The big negatives have to do with the dialogue. First off, there's way too much of it, especially in the first third of the game. Every conversation goes on for about 4 exchanges longer than it has to. They could have easily cut the in between mission dialogue in half and it would have been a better game.

The dialogue also suffers from Thor: Love & Thunder-esque tonal whiplash and over-quippiness. In the first third of the game they shoehorn a quip into the end of every conversation, regardless of what it is about. The dialogue gets better after that once the demons show up, but the bad dad jokes never go away completely. It's not cringey, but it is eye roll inducing.

The Friendship system is ok overall, but it's also tonally all over the place. Sometimes the writing is good and it feels like two buds hanging out and getting to know each other. Other times it feels like to world's most repressed dating sim where you talk about how you want to travel the world together but Marvel won't let you kiss. The clubs are also mostly painfully dumb with only the EMO KIDS (more bad dad joke humor here) one actually contributing to the plot. Blade's book club walling you in like it's a boss battle until you talk to everyone in it just drags.

There's also a light/dark alignment thing that feels tacked on and pointless. All maxing out in either direction does is [spoiler]unlock one costume and one upgrade card. There is 0 story impact from your alignment.[/spoiler] Going full light doesn't stop you from using dark cards and it doesn't enhance the light cards either and vice versa.

Once I updated my Nvidia drivers the game was stable and never crashed on me running a RTX 3060 and a Ryzen 5 5600, but there are  few other bugs/issues still present:
- Definitely update your drivers before playing! I got 3 crashes early on and the texture on the heroes faces/skins weren't loading for some reason too, making them all look weirdly smoothed out. Updating the drivers fixed both issues.
- Morbius’ Lab seems either bugged or not displaying properly. If you apply a negative trait to something that’s already 0, it doesn’t stay zero. Instead it appears to go negative internally but still display as 0 since if you do a sparring session or get a prestige level later it will still show the trait is 0 despite the +10 increase applied and it remains at 0 until you cancel out the negative that you can't see. Either it shouldn't be going negative or it should at least show us that it is negative.
- There's no way to sort/organize combat items so you have to scroll through all of them to see if you have any duplicates.
- The prestige friendship level reward overlays trigger at the start of a hangout and stay on top of everything instead of showing up afterwards like they should.",1688402811,1688402811,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will however say that as a big Marvel fan I really, really love this game. I bought it on sale with the season pass and all the DLC and for me it was totally worth it, it personally would of been worth it to me at full-price even. 
I mean they even have Morbius in the game! Jokes aside they really do have like all my favorite Marvel characters in this: Spider-Man, Venom, Hulk, Wolverine, and Storm to name just a few. I mean that's my Top 5 and they are all in the game and playable. :)

As a big fan of both Marvel and tactical RPGs this game is so much fun. If you have a pretty decent PC preferably with ray-tracing capabilities then I highly recommend this game to any Marvel fans out there.

Of course, this is (at its core gameplay) still a card based tactical game - so if you hate these this might not be for you.

Graphics:
Excellent, even if some of the characters differ a bit from their movie look.

Story:
entertaining and well written, characters also act like I would expect them to.
Theres the usual helpful friendly neighbourhood spider, the ever cool acting Tony, the mysterical Dr. Strange.
All in their typical manner and even some banter between them is included.
Parts of the Game (the Abbey, being something like the spaceship from Mass Effect or the Camp from Dragon Age) reminded me of these games.
You meet the other characters there and side stories are expanded.

Gameplay:
The tactical card battle on the first glimpse seems to be a bit simple, but the game manges to keep you entertained by always presenting you with new heroes, new abilities, new combinations to try out.
As in any card based game, luck and RNG is important from time to time. The game offers a wide range of difficulty options, and even rewards you for advancing on higher difficulties.

Overall:

It's got this super cool tactical card battle system, some really decent dialogue, and skills that are just on another level. But fair warning, it can be a bit of a hog when it comes to system resources, so make sure you've got a beefy setup.

Pros:
First things first, let's talk about those tactical card battles. They're like the icing on the cake. You get to build your dream team of Marvel superheroes and then unleash their powers using a deck of cards. It's like a brainy chess match mixed with epic superhero action. Players are not only tasked with assembling a team of iconic Marvel heroes but also strategically utilizing their abilities through a deck of cards. This unique approach adds a layer of depth and strategy to the battles, making each encounter a thrilling and engaging experience. The ability to customize and upgrade these cards further enhances the tactical aspect of the game, allowing players to experiment and find the perfect combination for their playstyle.

Moreover, the game excels in providing nuanced skills for each hero, giving players a wide range of abilities to explore and master. From devastating attacks to powerful support skills, each hero feels unique and essential to the team. The diverse roster of iconic Marvel characters further enhances the gameplay experience, allowing players to experiment and create synergistic combinations that suit their preferred playstyle. It's like having a box of chocolates, but instead of chocolates, you get a bunch of kick-ass superpowers.

Now, when it comes to the dialogue, Marvel's Midnight Suns doesn't disappoint. The writing has just the right amount of banter, and the conversations between characters land well for the most part. This adds an extra dimension to the storytelling, allowing players to shape the narrative and experience a sense of agency within the Marvel universe.

Cons:

The 2k launcher. ""nuff said.

Another thing, Marvel's Midnight Suns demands a bit of horsepower from your rig. So, if you're rocking a potato, you might run into some performance issues and longer loading times. 

In conclusion, Marvel's Midnight Suns is a standout title that successfully merges tactical card battles, compelling dialogue, and nuanced skills to deliver an exciting and immersive gaming experience. The innovative gameplay mechanics, coupled with the well-crafted narrative and character interactions, make this game a must-play for both Marvel fans and tactical strategy enthusiasts. Despite the system resource requirements and the launcher, the overall quality and enjoyment provided by Marvel's Midnight Suns make it a worthy addition to any gaming library. So suit up, Hunter, grab your cards, and get ready for an unforgettable adventure in the Marvel universe.",1688246373,1688246373,True,17,1,0.587082922458648682,0,True,False,False

having played through all the DLC it makes the game feel like a much bigger world and all of the characters introduced fit into the roster extremely well.

Original review:
As should be obvious from my hours played, I enjoyed the game.  However, I don't recommend purchasing it at this point. 

The game is heavily locked down against gameplay mods, and it has one of the strangest implementations of NG+ that I've seen, where you lose almost everything from the prior play through. Oddly, characters unlocked in the previous play remain unlocked in NG+, but the story isn't updated to reflect that. Thus, for instance, while your team is frantically attempting to find and save a certain character, she's sitting around your base and can be taken on missions, hang outs, and so forth. Some significant performance issues remain unfixed, and the first DLC was just released in a state that required a hot fix to be playable by a large portion of the player base.

In the places that the game is fun, it's really fun. It has so much potential, but the devs need to get their stuff together, address the deficiencies, and stop locking down a single player game as if it were an online competitive multiplayer game.",1675268815,1688074830,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, there is a great deal of Mass Effect or Persona style talking and friendship management which may or may not be your thing. 

Second, since Firaxis actually does an admirable job of trying to portray the characters accurately, you'll probably find certain characters really good or really annoying, because that's kind of what the source material is like at this point. 

Third, the writing is all over the place. The dialogue is a mix of campy, great, and annoying and so are the plot elements. The basic bones of the story work, but there are parts that are missing or aren't fully thought out. There is also a frustrating tendency to repeat the same lines over and over from cutscene to cutscene like the writers do not trust the player to remember anything.

These points aside, this game is fun to play. I wish the whole thing was up to the standard of the combat, but it is what it is.

Edit: --Spoilers Follow--

I finished the final mission. The mission itself, as nearly all the others, was fun and engaging! Unfortunately, the story remained at the middling quality I mentioned above throughout. I noticed two things about the story in addition. First, there is a frequent insertion of the writing team's politics into the lines of various characters who probably wouldn't say them and second, Marvel's phase 4 movie story rules clearly seem to be in effect. Sadly, the former made it hard to be immersed in the story and the second made the ending predictable. The post-credits scene pointed to a potential sequel/DLC. And maybe I'll play it if the writing improves, but for now, I think I'll go back to XCOM 2.

Edit 2: DLC: Like the base game, it plays well and has a silly story. Wish I could say more positive about it, but in the end I think this group of devs might just be better with more sandbox style storylines.",1671236125,1687799036,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

The combat is probably people’s biggest worry about the game before buying it. I was also a little hesitant upon hearing ‘card battler’, but I came out pleasantly surprised. There are more than a dozen heroes and the fun comes in customizing their decks and pairing different heroes together. Scarlet Witch hits hard but she requires enemies to be close together, something that makes her good to pair with someone like Magik who specializes in moving enemies. 

The game’s story is interesting but I really found myself enjoying the day-to-day interactions with the heroes the most.

But because of too many problems with downloading the patches every time there's an update, I have come to the conclusion that it is no longer worth my time to try to keep playing this game and have now uninstalled it. I have never played a game on steam that has to re-download half the game every time there's an update. A few small changes should not have to be 30GB+ every time. Also the updates restarts from zero if you pause it or lose connection. In addition, apparently there has to be enough disc space to install the entire game (or somewhere close to this) on your computer while the game is already installed, or the patch will not finish downloading. You get no warning about this. It just says that there's not enough disc space, while the download is close to finishing, and if you try to uninstall something, and then try to resume the download, it starts at 0% again. It's like the entire game is made in one single file or something. This has been the same every patch after i bought it, and I think I've spent on average 50GB of my data plan on this game every month since then. Since I pay about 30 euro for 100GB a month, it basically means I'm paying 15 euro each month to play this game. Expensive game.
I will rather play something else now that doesn't make me uninstall other games every month and use up so much of my data plan, and maybe install it in a few years when the developers are no longer updating it.

[b]Considerations for you[/b]
[list]
[*] Do you love underseen Marvel characters and want to play them and experience them in cutscenes?  I loved playing the Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider, Magik, and Spidey the most, but there is some great depth here.
[*]  Do you like cardplay-based mechanics and chaining interactions to maximize your turns?  This is the best part of the gameplay.
[*] Do you like choose-your-decision social interactions between almost every single mission?  They're here and I loved them, but boy do other people hate them.
[*] Are you prejudiced towards or against certain popular Marvel characters?  I sighed a little that we had to have Stark and Logan, but you don't have to play them much.  I was pleasantly surprised by Morbin' Time, and only wish the movie character were more like this version.
[*]  Do you need your computer to move quickly and never stutter or freeze?  Don't buy this.  My computer is at minimum specs, and I did resort to bringing something else to do during the waits.  Even skipping the atrocious DRM launcher did not speed up my experience.
[/list]

I personally loved this game and played it a LOT when I was not scheduling much time at work.  I enjoyed it enough to play through and then alt my way to a full light and full darkness version.  Unlike many commenters, I enjoyed the ""tedious"" interaction sections at the Abbey.  I wish that I had bought the DLC in the package for $60 total when it was on sale, because the DLC was a fun addition that stretched my time, but I ended up paying a bit more than I had to.  The Mod scene is excellent, ranging from a great visual change on Agatha to all sorts of gameplay additions.

[b] The Good [/b]
[list]
[*] Play as Marvel characters and your own somewhat-customizable one throughout a strong Lilith-centered Cthon storyline.
[*] Make tough and inspired decisions when card draw is not ideal.  ""If I charge that guy so he is damaged, then Morbin him out, I can hit the other two with...""
[*] Build the ideal card sets for your favorite heroes that set them up to really shine in character.
[/list]

[b] The Bad [/b]
[list]
[*] Be forced to interact with every member of the team to develop their best selves, including very comiclike soap opera interpersonal storylines.
[*] Have to work around implausibly buffed enemies on certain missions to achieve the goals you need, not just wipe the floor with disposable goons.
[*] Even skipping the DRM launcher with steam shortcuts, the demands on processing and graphics are horrific, and you will wish that they were much more efficient.

[b]Pros:[/b]

Fun Gameplay: People were skeptical of the card based system when it first came out, including me. But it works very well, allowing for both challenging and satisfying combat. It's especially fun as you research combat upgrades, allowing even more strategy. A big part of the combat is actually outside the cards. Moving, shoving, using environmental attacks, and knowing where to knock enemies back to are key. This allows combat to be much more dynamic than it first appears. And each character plays very differently, even all four DLC characters, allowing for a wide variety of playstyles.

Strong Characters: Really, this game is a RPG, and a RPG needs good characters, especially in the party. Luckily, Midnight Suns delivers. All the characters are very true to their comic selves, and I really enjoyed increasing my friendship with them and hanging out between missions. The voice acting is also top notch, with many returning veterans (though Brain Bloom is doing his Bradford voice rather than Captain America voice. I guess with this being Frixas he thought he should, lol.) While its weird to have so many non-mystical characters in a mystical game, it makes it work in the end.

Good Story: The story is nothing groundbreaking, but it's more than serviceable for a game trying to have the most fun superheroic plot it can. It's pretty standard superhero end of the world stuff, but with enough twists and turns to keep things interesting.

[b]Cons:[/b]

The Abbey: Several reviewers have complained about the Abbey, but they seem to focus on the interactions with characters, which I enjoyed. No, my biggest problem with the game is the literal Abbey itself is tedious. Running from one location to another takes awhile, the exploration is cool in theory, but quickly loses its charm, and it feels like time wasting. It's especially bad when trying to craft and upgrade new cards. Running back and forth between the forge and the training ground is an exercise in tedium, and I wish you could just switch between Abbey locations with the press of a button.

Glitches: There are some, even now. Nothing game breaking, but sometimes enemies will get caught on something before snapping to the correct position, a character will fall of the map but still be in their original place, or the like. There's also an absurd amount of clipping on some of the clothes. 

In the end, the game was marketed poorly. It's not X-Com with superheroes. It is its own thing, a fun superheroic RPG with card based tactical combat. Perhaps had it been marketed more this way it may have succeeded. RPG fans I find are much more tolerant of new and weird combat systems. Alas, it was not. But if you're a superhero fan, a RPG fan, or a superheroic RPG fan, I highly recommend Marvel's Midnight Suns.

Consider XCom: EW where a lowly sectoid can flank and insta gib your recruit with a plasma pistol. This game has none of it. Your characters can not die, just fail a mission. And the difficulty is just plain wrong, like having a 300-400 hp hydra shield unit, while my heroes are around 100hp. So I have to spam the same, super-cool attack animations that may deal like 90 damage multiple times to kill that shield unit within the X number of turns allowed, otherwise I can not even touch the objective. Every turn the game spawns reinforcements, and I have no idea how many or what type they will be. 

This feels wrong in a bad way. Adding up 3-4 hp rifle shots to take down a 10 hp Muton in XCom feels rewarding. Picking 3 cards to deal 134 damage to a 400 hp shield unit does not. The card game simply does not have enough depth to it to remain interesting for long. 

Maybe the mods will fix this, but for now the early game (I don't even have the hulk yet) feels boring.

I bought it originally close to release and was met with stuttering, crashing and freezing, only later finding out that it was due to the 2K launcher forcing itself to be used on startup. After finding a workaround the issues I had running the game were resolved. After playing the game for an initial 40 hours I came to find similar problems to most others: the game's interactions were not meaningful and repetitive; the crafting system was complicated and drawn out due to unnecessary cut scenes; the exploration within the Abbey's semi-open world was boring and repetitive due to the nature of the story sections and the inability to run, jump, and maneuver as you would in a game of similar scope. That said, the combat system is incredibly engaging to the point that I found myself ignoring the game's other problems. If you enjoy the superhero genre and games like XCOM this should be up your alley. Being able to pick your favorite heroes and level them up on a team of YOUR creation is one of the best parts of the game and keeps the player extremely engaged in the story. The story is whatever, I found myself putting my most time into this game playing the side missions with different team compositions over and over again which is a testament to how good the gameplay loop really is. The game to me was enjoyable and something I'll definitely keep coming back to casually, but if games with similar combat systems like the XCOM series, WH40K, and AoW4, are not games you find yourself interested in you may not find this as enjoyable as I did.",1687113086,1687113086,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The attack animations and character details are well done and I never got tired of looking at them even after 60 hours. The story is good is well, nothing award-winning but entertaining enough that keeps you motivated to push on.

I will say that while the voice-acting is good (a lot of the characters reprise their roles from other Marvel shows and games), the actual dialog is very cheesy and painfully PG. There is some funny dialog here and there, but I found that after 20 hours I had to begin skipping the casual dialog with the characters (something I never do in games) because it was just so tedious and melodramatic. A lot of times it felt like the characters were high-school teens with the silly drama they were coming up with, instead of seasoned adults. It is essentially required to gain powerful bonuses as well, but I just wish the actually dialog was more entertaining such as something in similar conversation RPGs like Mass Effect or Fallout. If you love the Marvel movies and shows however, you will likely like the dialog but just wasn't for me.

The DLC is hit or miss, I would really only recommend them if you like the characters they provide as they don't offer much to the main game and story. I found the DLC missions to be a bit harder but much more annoying, but they are very short, just 3 missions per DLC.

Overall, if you like XCOM, Marvel, Card Collecting, and Dialog heavy games, then I would recommend this game, primarily if it is on-sale.

Then I saw it was card-based and my expectations dropped. Why would they ruin a good pairing by going and making it a card game?  In addition, early reviews really slammed the non-combat Abbey portions of the game. I ended up passing on the game at release (sorry to all the Firaxis folks that lost their jobs... T_T).

When the Legendary edition went on sale, I decided to give it a shot and I am glad I did. The game manages to keep the XCOM strategy vibe and the card-based combat is actually very fun and rewarding, and serves the Marvel property well. It was very satisfying figuring out the best combos to take out enemies in as few turns as possible, with flashy super moves where you can really feel the impact.  

The reviews were mostly right about the Abbey portions however...they tend to drag on and by the end I was skipping most of the non-story related dialogue. The main story itself is passable, but nothing to write home about.  Most of the characters live up to the comic and MCU counterparts, though I absolutely detested Nico. Overall, if you are a Marvel fan, you will likely enjoy the story and characters for the most part.

I was tempted to write a negative review because of the serious problems that this game has, but at the same time, I don't hate it. To make it short.

[h1] Good [/h1]

+ The list of characters includes less popular characters. Blade, Nico, Magik etc. It's not just Avengers or X-Men again.
+ The plot of the game is fresh. 
+ Still modern Turn-Based combat (XCOM), but with superheroes. Each hero is different. Some of them have unique mechanics. No more random recruits. 
+ Different outfits.
+ No Overwatch. Many XCOM clones used (and probably still use) this mechanic. It makes the combat boring and repetitive. I can't imagine how a PvP match in a game with overwatch would look like.
+ No Chance to Hit/less RNG. I had enough of this mechanic back in XCOM 2. I remember when my character with a shotgun was in front of the enemy and with a 90+ chance to hit, he still missed the shot. In MS, you always hit the target.

[h1] Bad [/h1]

- Annoying enemy types. It's how XCOM and now MS work. The more you advance through the story, the more enemy types you will encounter. Some can multiply and clone any unit, others will make bonds with other units, so they can't be killed separately. I honestly had enough of these games. It's like every Turn-based game is using this formula.

- Some outfit choices are poor. Fallen, Medieval etc. There are much more interesting options in the comics.

- Item/Plant gathering mechanic is filler. This is not a MMO. Not even a classic RPG.

- Some of the dialogues are cringe, silly or woke. Also, Deadpool used the same joke that Iron Man used in Marvel's Avengers. "" For Me? You Shouldn't Have."" Do I need to explain to you why it was MS who stole the joke?

- Speaking of woke. As you may or may not know, the Marvel has gone woke since the 2010s. Why 2010s? I will tell you, my curious friend. Around that time, the Disney company has bought Marvel. 2010s became an era of ""cashgrab"" movies. With each movie it was worse and worse. More dumb humor, more woke stuff. So we have come to the point where a lot of people are tired of this crap. It's not limited to movies. Comics have also taken this direction. Race change, gender change.

Ms. Marvel (Carol) took the mantle of Captain Marvel, who is originally a man. They had to change the damn character and make her look like a lesbian feminist. She will tell you how poor Thor is sad that he is number 3 of the strongest character, after Captain Marvel and Hulk.

Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze) (white male) was replaced by a new character - Robbie Reyes (Latino). Not that I have anything against Latinos or Robbie, but I'm pretty sure that Johnny had enough popularity.

At least they didn't include female versions of Hawkeye and Thor. We do have old lesbian witches...

- This game is a technical mess. FPS drops in some battles (I had this in final battle), long loading times before the Abbey (even with SSD), texture (neck) bug, character animation (battle) bugs, broken music (will stop playing) bug. The biggest problem is the Abbey performance. FPS drops are huge. Developers released a few patches, but that didn't solve the problem.

[h1] The game was a commercial failure [/h1]

""Take-Two CEO Srauss Zelnick admits the tactical role-playing game Marvel's Midnight Suns developed by Firaxis has been a commercial failure.""

""December release window could take some blame, as it pit the game in direct competition with other anticipated titles like The Callisto Protocol and High on Life. Though, The Callisto Protocol underwhelmed both critics and audiences alike and is also considered a commercial flop for its publisher Krafton.""

By now, you should know that games released in December were mediocre or worse. Few were also commercial failures. Weak excuse, in my opinion. Also, Jake Solomon announced his departure from Firaxis.

This genre is not very popular. Add to that MS card-based combat system, filler content, and poor optimization, and you can see why this game failed. Few people like turn-based games. Especially card games.

Who was the target audience for Midnight Suns? According to statistics from one website, Marvel fans are predominantly white. With the number of males being a bit higher than females. Latinos were around 9%. Others are even less.
Around 40%  of the ""fans"" were Millennials, quarter Boomers, quarter of X people and around 7% were Zoomers.
If we bring statistics related to ""gamers"", then the number of female players will drop significantly.

Now I will ask again - Who was the target audience? I'm not trying to be an elitist, but the facts don't care about our feelings. Dialogues and some character choices made me think that this game targeted ""rainbow"" Zoomers. 
Some TBS fans may find this game less tactical or simply hate superhero stuff.
Some ""older"" (not children) players won't find dialogues/characters interesting.
Many Marvel fans won't like new/replaced characters.

I'm not saying you should ignore this game, but if you plan on playing it, then be prepared for bugs/performance issues. I also think the price is too high for what we get.",1686411484,1686916300,False,2,0,0.416666656732559204,0,True,False,False

Wish there'd been more choice of cards for heroes that weren't the main character. Wish some of the writing had been a little tighter/less comic schlock-y. Wish somebody had done an edit pass over the subtitles, which had several typos.

Otherwise, fantastic game. Good deckbuilding mechanics, plenty of choice without being overwhelming. Good story. Fun characters. Moments of genuine humor, moments of genuine pathos. Liked the exploration of the Abbey grounds (though it could have been better, certainly).

There's really two games in one here: a card-based strategy action game, and a friendship simulator. I've gotten every achievement (there's one that I still haven't been able to trigger), and have done basically everything to do in the game.

[b]Card-Based Action Strategy Game[/b]: MOST cards are interesting in some way. Even if they don't always work out the way you hope, there's generally only one or two cards (out of many, many options) per character that I would classify as total duds. The upgrading options for the cards allows things that you initially didn't think highly of to suddenly find a valuable role in your deck, and sometimes specific character combinations make otherwise mediocre cards really shine. There's TONS of room for customization to your own playstyle, while different mission leaders cause you to have to constantly adapt and try different characters. Thankfully, each character feels very unique, even when adding in all of the DLC (I'll get to that). 

10/10, terrific gameplay loop that's satisfying with every character.

[b]Friendship Simulator[/b]: When you're not off on missions, you spend your time at The Abbey, a hidden sanctuary in a pocket dimension inside Salem, Massachusetts. You can explore the grounds, find and solve mysteries (usually to unlock chests with cosmetics), and follow a sub-plot to gain access to great combat bonuses, along with your good girl demon dog, Charlie. Inside the Abbey itself, you can talk to a huge cast of characters from throughout the Marvel Universe, and befriend them via conversation, group activities (I love Blade's Book Club), exchanging gifts, and doing other activities like bonding over a drink (of root beer, much to Wolverine's dismay), or playing video games. A lot of the dialogue here is pretty hit or miss. Some characters and their developments and subplots are GREAT, and some just fall really flat.

8.5/10, some characters could have used a bit more work, and I would have liked to see a bit more steps in the process overall. A big note here is that some of these things are not exactly skippable, and you'll lose out of valuable combat bonuses if you skip the ones that are.

[b]Story[/b]: It's an interesting mix of comic heroes and villains, with a new story, rather than ripping something straight out of comics. The story itself is interesting, and the cast works well within it. It's not amazing, and definitely has some pacing issues, but is pretty good. There's too many instances of, ""Well if this person that has been here the whole time had shared THAT piece of information, we could have done this way faster,"" and ""If this person had only asked for help, this other problem would have never come up"" as primary ways to keep the story chugging along, and add to it. The [i]overall[/i] story is just decent, in that regard, but the character to character interactions are often great. There's not much new in the character interactions if you've read a lot of comics, but they're presented extremely well, and many of them develop organically, rather than feeling like I'm just reading a wiki. 

8.5/10

[b]DLC[/b]: All four DLC characters weave a connected story, separate from the main one, to add basically an entire extra (much, much shorter) campaign revolving around a whole new cast of characters. I actually might like this storyline more than the main storyline, simply because it's more focused and lacks a lot of those pacing issues I mentioned above. Combat-wise, they continue to all feel very different than every other character in the game, which is remarkable at this point, given the size of the cast. For the friendship simulator aspect of the game, most of them are pretty dry; I think they rushed that part of development for the DLC, based on fast timelines. Venom's interactions with Peter, and Morbius's interactions with Blade are pretty good, though. And Deadpool adds a lot of needed humor to the game.

9/10

[b]Music[/b]: It's serviceable. Nothing standout, positively or negatively.

7/10

Ok, on to the bugs. As mentioned at the top, I've gotten all achievements except one. I may need to wind up playing through the game a THIRD time in order to get the achievement to trigger. I'm hoping they just fix that one like they've fixed others, so that sometime down the line I can just load my save file, and it'll happen. I do like the game, so playing it a third time at some point isn't the end of the world.

The BIGGEST problem though, is the constant performance issues. When finishing loading, things stutter for a little bit, but it smooths out pretty quickly; that's not really an issue to me. What is an issue is how frequently it [b]CRASHES MY ENTIRE COMPUTER, AND I HAVE TO HARD RESET IT![/b] I've played 25 hours in the past two weeks. In that timeframe, this has happened six times. Thankfully, the game very frequently autosaves, so I don't typically lose much if any progress, but it's extremely annoying, and does mean I can't do anything else actually important on my computer while playing the game. It's a major, major issue.

[b]Overall[/b]: As-is, 8/10. If they fix those other bugs, 9/10.",1686312764,1686312764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Reviews that have portrayed it as a kind of ""X-Com with superheroes"" are wrong. It's more like ""Fights in Tight Spaces with superheroes"".  In that sense, I recommend it. The loop of getting better cards after each mission is pretty well done. The heroes themselves play differently enough and have enough unique strategy to them that it makes it interesting to put together teams. The selection of enemies could be broader, but it is not so much worse than, say, Fights in Tight Spaces, and that go me through 107 hours. EDIT: I spoke too soon about variety of enemies, there is at least one point in the game where the variety increases substantially.

It is, however, layered over with all of this extra graphics stuff, none of which adds much of anything to the game, really. I mean, some of the dialogue and story stuff is fun; I really like Magik and Spider-man's bits. And playing paper dolls with superheroes is momentary pleasant diversion. But so much effort was put into a game that, honestly, would have been just as good if not better in a full ""Darkest Dungeon"" interface, with well done cell animation and no 3d effects at all.  The fight scenes are ok. There are some bits that are really fun the first 20 times you see them, and then you are like ""right, I get it, Deadpool gives me a thumbs up sign when the explosion happens behind him, hahah"". None of this extra graphics layer is so well done, none of it has such good art direction, that it seems worth the effort expended on it.  I say this as a very die-hard Marvel comics fan since like 1979. It's good to see these characters done in a game like this, its almost a dream come true, but at the same time, meh to a lot of their art direction choices.

Hands-down this is my favorite game of all time.  This is a love letter to the Marvel Universe, but it is not for everyone due to its pacing.

Once per day you go on a combat mission, but for the rest of the day you are interacting with the other characters, sometimes collecting herbs (if you wish), training, setting up intelligence missions, and spending time 1-on-1 with them to develop a friendship with each character that has very beneficial perks and combat buffs.  It is this relationship development which many people have impatience with, but if you can settle into it and not attempt to rush through from one combat mission to the next day after day you will be rewarded by developing a team into a family and bonding with them and the storyline.

The heroes you acquire along the way are plentiful and really well fleshed out. I cannot get enough of it, it gives me MASSIVE Mass Effect 2 vibes and I just wish there were more. Don't get me wrong, there's loads already but some heroes are teased by mentioning and I think (ooh am I gonna get them?) and they stop there. Thor gets mentioned a couple times but he never comes along, same with Johnny Blaze, Ultron, Magneto and a few other names get dropped that you never encounter.

There are a few bugs, especially in the subtitles, a lot of missing words or completely incorrect words. There's also some stuttering that *can* be fixed with the 2k launcher fix in the community hub but there's still some that goes on later in the game. Specifically entering or leaving the yard into the abbey causes the game to REALLY lag for a second or two.

The combat is honestly the funnest I've played in a long time, and I'm not sure any description I could give would really do it justice. Try watching a (decent) person play for a while in a mid-game level where they've unlocked some of the mechanics and hopefully you will see how rewarding it can be to see a planned turn go just right, combining your abilities with interacting with the environment and objectives. I don't think there has ever been a better way of representing superhero combat in a game before. The combat requires more thinking than XCOM, with every hero having a set of abilities and play-styles that all feel distinct and interesting. If the whole 'card' thing bothers you, just think of it as a way of forcing you to improvise your actions each turn and use all the heroes.

A lot of the criticisms have come from the abbey/social side of the game. Honestly I enjoyed most of that too. The story may be tropey (though I would question what game isn't) but it is perfectly serviceable and has several really good moments. Without spoilers, I will say that everything to do with Wanda and Magik is great, as well as the overall plots of the DLC, and the Hunter's background. Yes, the dialog can go on a bit, but you can skip all of it if you get tired so I really don't think it's a problem.

In total finishing the campaign and DLC took me about 60 hours, but I wasn't really rushing through it as I was having so much fun spamming the optional side missions.

The story is pretty good. Hell, I am not a marvel guy, but I enjoyed all the personality stuff, some of the interactions actually feel quite genuine. All the background stuff, like conversations on the Stark social media thing, added to the fun.

Ended up buying this on sale because I loved XCOM back in the day and was willing to give them a shot with a reimagined Tac RPG, wanted to support the studio, and saw that Morbius was a playable character. Yup, I bought the game for the meme, but stayed because it's actually really fun.

Core gameplay loop is very satisfying. I personally would have preferred if heroes had their own independent action/move economy, but can't complain about the finished product. I think there's going to be a lot of replayability here because of the number of heroes and different directions in which you can take each of their individual decks. This game scratches a similar itch to XCOM. It's not the same, but it's still really good. And far lower stress. Can be fun every now and then to play as the OP characters fighting waves of mooks missing 99% hit chance point blank shotgun blasts. Writing is solid. I don't know why so many reviewers whine about it. It's not Shakespeare, but neither is XCOM. The story and writing are good enough to get me interested in characters I otherwise would know nothing about (never heard of Nico Midoru or Agatha Harkness, for example). That's enough for me. The Whedon MCU-style quip fiesta is a little much for me at times, but I can't blame the studio for capturing the feel of a modern Marvel IP. Monetization wasn't an issue IMO. I personally don't care about cosmetics, so maybe that's the reason. Played the entire campaign on default skins and did not feel anything was missing. Let Firaxis make a million dollar skin, if they want. I just want them to make enough money for a sequel.

Relationship management is a new one for me. Thought it was fine and actually very helpful because I knew nothing about most of these characters (I don't consume a lot of Marvel media). Much better to force me to talk with these characters and learn who they are through dialogue then have me run around with no clue who Nico Midoru, Robbie Reyes, or Agatha Harkness are.

My main complaint is I wish that the forge and training grounds (where you buy consumable/card upgrades for missions) were purely navigable through menus like XCOM. I enjoyed being able to run around the abbey as a home base, and think the exploration element is a good balance to the fightings, but I actually ended up spending less time deckbuilding because  of how annoying the card management system is. I also wish there was a way to save multiple decks per hero. 

Would definitely recommend buying the complete edition, at least on sale. You'll get your money's worth. Also, if Firaxis changed Morbius's ""Bloodlust"" ability to ""Morbin Time,"" they would recoup all their financial losses and guarantee a sequel. Appreciate that they worked the meme into the dialogue, though.

The story is top-notch, which is good, because much of the game has the feel of an interactive novel. There is a lot of emphasis on your character's relationship with the game's many heroes, but because these are Marvel characters that you have at least heard about already, the interactions and dialogues are all very interesting. The story's pacing is very well done, and you are welcome to move through the story at light-speed or at a snail's pace, depending on how many missions you want to run between story missions.

The combat in missions is really a card-game, and the challenge is working out how to use the abilities/cards of the heroes you take with you most efficiently. The deck-building is managed between missions, and players who are into the meta of the cards can devote a lot of attention here. If you want to be more casual about it, you can just keep the skill level on the low side. The system is very well done... almost surprisingly so. 

Between missions and character dialogues, your character has another story that you can progress at your own pace that explains some of the back-story of the game's primary protagonist. This is more a game of exploration and a series of solo missions. It was a nice addition to what is already a very big game.

The final mission was brilliant, and the game's ending was good. That's hard to pull off in RPG's with such an epic feel.

The combat is great too, the animations are well done and really feel powerful, each hero feels unique and finding the right synergies with different team combinations is fun, if you play in higher difficulties the missions can be very challenging and require a lot of thinking and careful strategy but it feels very rewarding to find the perfect play to ""solve the puzzle"" and beat those hard encounters.

The story is pretty good and it's a very good change of pace from the regular settings we see in other marvel games, a lot of magic, witchcraft, supernatural, elder gods and pretty bad-ass demonized versions of heroes and villains.

I spent over 100 hrs playing this game on approximately the minimum hardware requirements, and it ran quite well.
I spent most of that time doing side missions (by choice), which I quite enjoyed. The mission structure in this game is much more relaxed than XCOM, where there is no worry of an ""endgame"" state if you just want to do side missions, work on card strategies, and improve your character stats.

There is a mission mechanic where you can unlock higher difficulties for future missions if you do well enough on the current highest difficulty that's unlocked. I find working through the strategic game-play fun enough that I've found my way up to the highest difficulty. I think that's a neat way to find the difficulty that suits the player best as well as a testament to how well they did on the strategic game-play. Even in the most challenging scenarios, there is usually a strategic way to complete the mission. For example, I've never had to lower the difficulty or restart a scenario because I found it too difficult, but rather have instead reloaded an earlier scenario/mission save to find a strategically better way to approach it. Quite fun and satisfying, I think, when I find a card strategy during a difficult mission that works really well!",1685452596,1685452596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a solid turn based strategy game that adds new mechanics and layers to the XCOM model by utilizing card play that guides your tactical combat. Gone are the ""99% chance to hit and whiff"" nonsense of XCOM. It blends board game tactical RPG with tactical CRPG very well.

I'm not a fan of most superhero stuff these days, but this game really gives each hero time to shine as well as the archvillains. There's plenty of variety between their play styles and enemies have enough variety with lesser, mid, bosses, and archvillains to keep things interesting and to up the challenge level as you advance. There's plenty of ways to build each of your heroes through the base game, and the DLC. And unlike many other games, the DLC is meaningful, worth the money, and just as good or better than the base game in both game play and story telling.

Your Hunter character has multiple ways to customize combat style, and the other heroes do as well (up to a point). Some heroes seem powerful in the beginning, then fade fast halfway through the campaign and are weak imo. Others are kinda bad from the get go. I'd say about half were potent enough to play through to the end of the campaign and DLC content after they've been maxed out (upgraded and modded cards). But honestly, I haven't tried all of the builds and play styles for the characters, so I may be short changing them (ie. Ghost Rider or Nico). There's plenty of web pages that have ""best"" builds for each character, and of course, there appear to be more than one for each character so there is no real ""best."" So it comes down to play style. Still, this is testament to the depth and thought that went into this game.

The game toggles between day and night cycles. During the day you spar to gain XP with your heroes and get one time next mission power ups and permanent stat increases. You then do daily upkeep like picking out which special ops missions to run to get cards or other rewards, resolve your rewards from yesterday's victory, upgrade/mod existing cards, and run around and pick up free junk on the floor (credits, 3 essences, and gloss). 

At night you can go to a temple to give up an artifact and get a free key to unlock chests with. As you play the game there's lots of chests to open as the game's world opens up more and more. The locks can be popped again on timed intervals. Some require keys, some don't. They give you rewards mentioned above and cosmetics. You can also join a hangout to up one hero's friendship level with you. You get usable rewards and cosmetics for getting their friendship level high enough.

During both day/night you can go out and pick herbs, mushrooms, flowers, etc. which are used as reagents to grind into power cards. Power cards are added to your team (max 3) and are generally powerful (more heroism, card draw, marking targets, etc.).

I've played this on the hardest possible difficulty when available (the game won't unlock the hardest level, you have to ""graduate"" through each tier of difficulty). And unlike other games where you max out your abilities and become overpowered, this game keeps pace quite nicely up through the finale of the DLC.

I liked the story arcs a lot. They weren't the usual petty, mopey villain that doesn't have a reason to exist except for the heroes to fight against ala the movies. There's intertwined stories between the characters and it's cool and interesting how they change throughout the course of the game. The dialogue can get too chatty and kind of a drag to plow through, but the B key on your controller is your friend to speed read through it all. The anti-woke crowd will probably hate a lot of this. But I liked the diversity as there's some philosophical discussions on things that you don't normally see in video games spoken about with intelligence and empathy instead of throwaway, trendy lines of whatever is popular that moment. It never gets preach or annoying, moves on after it speaks its mind, and I thought it all fit well within the storylines.

There's plenty of customization of your character - both physical features and clothing. There's some customization of your hero buddies but not as much.

As far as replayability goes, the devs added in an upgrade to your base that lets you go in and battle customized enemies already seen in the game. I played these on the hardest possible level with an archvillain and I'm sorry to say that it was kind of a joke at that point. There's a + option to play the game all over again with everything you've unlocked remaining unlocked but I didn't want to sit through all of the cut scenes to play the same game. I'm not sure what the point of this mode is as you can keep replaying the game at the mission table which always updates after each day.

There's a few dings to an otherwise great game - the graphics performance, crashing, and the voluntary grinding in the DLC. Something must be up with the Unity engine, because everyone has been complaining about it - high end or mid grade rigs, AMD, Nvidia, etc. I have a 3060TI with 5600x CPU and it ran terribly. I had to made about 10 changes (after googling it) and even then it still ran like crap. I found another message thread that said to adjust the DLSS and a couple other things and it finally ran fine. There's no excuse for what's essentially a turn based card game to run like this. There's also random crashing. It's not often or too bad, because the game saves before and after missions in the background.

The grinding thing, I'm not sure how I feel about this. In the DLC, there are 4 new characters to play. You have to get them to friendship level 5 and then their special challenge unlocks which is a puzzle. After you beat it, you get their one and only legendary card. I don't recall having to devote this much time to getting the friendship levels up for the heroes in the primary game. I may have played 50 hours just doing this in the DLC and it was such a slog. The problem is, as I mentioned above, some heroes are kinda crappy, and they need every possible upgrade they can get. This is because the game forces you to play with 6 of them in the final DLC battle, none of whom are your Hunter character. And none of whom you can choose from. So in order to have a decent shot at winning, you need to grind to max out their abilities. You could probably do without their legendaries, as I thought some were redundant or not that great.

To conclude, this game is totally worth the money, especially now with the large discount. It's too bad as it sounds like Firaxis didn't make any money on this one so we may not see the likes of it again.",1685325619,1685325619,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Was that your favorite part of the movie? WELL GUESS WHAT. They made a game where you can hang out for endless hours with all your favorite Avengers and X-Men heroes. And you're gonna spend a lot, and I mean A LOT of time listening to heroes and their various problems, complaints, and dreams. Honestly, this game should be titled ""Midnight Suns: Hero Therapist"". 

Also at times you'll get to do the most random things to socialize, even though the literal end of the world is neigh and there are Hydra Nazis and vampires and Hydra Vampires running roughshod over NYC. Here's an example of the above.

Blade: Hunter, I really need your help on something.

Me: Oh hell yeah! It's Blade, the mutha-fluffin' half vamp who is a major bad ass! What do you need Blade? Are we gonna go fight a big evil vamp and you're gonna say, ""Some mutha-fluffas are always tryin' to ice skate uphill"" before you stake Stephen Dorff?

Blade: Uhhh... no. I was hoping you'd join my Book Club.

Me: *blinking* Book... Club?

Blade: Yeah... um, I kinda got the hots for Captain Marvel and you know how sexy book clubs are sooo...

Anyway, that's like 80% of the game. The other 15% you'll spend managing your various resources, combat cards, and outfits for you and all the heroes. Then, eventually, after you've run around doing all the socials and reading Superhero Instagram and finding hidden items around the base, FINALLY you'll get to do a combat mission.

Now don't get me wrong. I actually have enjoyed all of this for the most part, even when the convos and constant needs of the heroes got a little tedious. Because what makes this game pop are the actual hero moments. When you first meet Captain America and he comes crashing in with a hell of an entrance. When you get Venom on your team for the first time and he's just straight up EATING people. When Wolverine comes slicing through a pack of vamps before kicking Saber in the coin purse. This game sets up those hero moments and makes you work for them.

I'm somewhere in the middle. I love this sh*t, but can see where it would be a major disappointment to others (even though I generally don't agree with their arguments, that makes their views no less valid). Yes, it's grind and text heavy, but where that is a negative for many, it's presented in a way that's positive for me. I am not overwhelmed by the routine of the day-to-day...it actually fills in the story and develops a depth to the experience. It's a complete universe, and the characters are very well fleshed out and voiced (but damn...the friendship thing gets a bit homoerotic as well as hetroerotic, and I am sure that there is some whacked fan-fiction out there about it). 

As a story-heavy card-battler, I can see why some players are frustrated, but I am fully hooked and immersed in the story and the game-play. If you want pure combat and minimal grind, then this one might not be for you.

Rating: 8/10

Marvel Midnight Suns captures the essence of the Marvel universe with its passionate approach and enjoyable gameplay, making it a commendable addition to the Steam platform's Marvel lineup. While it excels in various areas such as deep gameplay mechanics, solid character development, outstanding audio design, and more, it does stumble in a few aspects. Nevertheless, this game is a must-play for TRPG and Marvel enthusiasts alike.

Let's delve into the positives. Marvel Midnight Suns demonstrates a clear passion for the Marvel franchise, evident in its top-notch voice acting, captivating hero animations, and the freedom to interact and develop relationships among the diverse Marvel ensemble. It truly serves as a love letter to Marvel video game fans, immersing players in a rich and colorful world. The game offers a substantial amount of content, providing over 40 hours of gameplay, which can be further extended with DLC and completionist endeavors. The animations and audio design enhance the immersive experience, heightening the excitement of battles and interactions. Moreover, the depth of the game mechanics allows for multiple strategic approaches to combat encounters, offering players a satisfying level of tactical decision-making.

However, there are a few areas that could have been improved. The occasional difficulty spikes disrupt the game's flow, leading to moments of frustration. Some poorly designed enemy types add an element of annoyance instead of contributing to the overall fun factor. The most notable drawback lies in the rushed and disappointing conclusion. It becomes apparent that the developers were pressed for time, resulting in an ending that feels abrupt and fails to match the quality of the well-paced and developed storyline. This underwhelming finale is undoubtedly the weakest aspect of the game.

In summary, Marvel Midnight Suns deserves an overall rating of 8/10. It delivers a marvelous adventure with its passionate approach, making it a noteworthy addition to any RPG and Marvel fan's collection. While it encounters a few missteps, such as occasional difficulty spikes and poorly designed enemy types, its love for the Marvel universe shines through. The rushed and disappointing ending may leave players yearning for a more satisfying conclusion. Nonetheless, Marvel Midnight Suns offers an engaging experience that will captivate fans of Marvel and TRPG genres alike.",1679050311,1685037884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is awesome. If you're a comic fan you're going to be surprised with this game's quality. Very few visual bugs, BEAUTIFUL graphics, amazing team flexibility (but there are some garbage heroes, this I can't deny). I'm amazed by the characters' interactions, it's so funny to see Strange and Stark poking each other about science and magic, Eddie trying to hide his admiration for Peter, and every other every day life interaction that the heroes have with each other. 

There are references to the comics, movies and shows. Crafting aspects, mysteries to solve, new interactions every day (the game has a day/night mechanic), friendship to build with your favorite heroes and if you're a Harry Potter fan this game is for you: there are SO MANY things related to magic, witches and sorcery to explore. I really feel that I'm living in a budget version of Hogwarts.

The hard mode (ultimate I, II or III) is really challenging, taking away revives and increasing enemy damage, health and quantity. It's been a pleasurable experience for me. But if you're not interested, the game features over 10 difficulty levels for you to choose.

The main story is good, the side quests are entertaning, there are multiple hero clubs to join and your alignment changes based on the skills you use (light or dark) and dialog options.

I really love going on a mission with my favorite heroes, building their movesets, watching their interactions while battling and strategizing. And last but not least: You can pet your pets and recieve rewards for doing it.",1684896567,1684896567,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

that will rise to meet you.

- I got the legendary edition on sale (1/2 price) (felt totally worth it) and the DLC characters do add a lot of distinct flavour and integrate nicely into the main campaign.

- Vast and Meaningful cosmetic/gameplay customisation, hope there can be more major options in the future dlc or sequel

- lots of Great risk/reward scenarios leading to interesting decisions, great resource economy that means you don't really  waste resources and nice mix of impactful short and long term goals

- Streamlines a lot of xcom luck based issues and yet still feels challenging

- Nice rhythm of daily missions and nightly hangouts

- Photo mode lets you put your photos up around your base


Cons:
- Sure the dialogue is a bit cheesy at times but it still has a lot of heart and spending time with your super hero buddies is great.

- Performance is fine for the most part but could be a bit better (drops when multiple things explode and physics objects go everywhere) - for reference I have a GTX3080Ti + i7-1200 cpu

Conclusion:
Amazing game, hope to see a more dlc/sequel amazing entry point for those new to the turn based action/strategy.",1684796399,1684796399,True,1,0,0.502074658870697021,0,True,False,False

You ve got marvel heroes, turned based combat with cards, mass effect dialogue with a lot of talking, building friendship and so on , you ve got base and other little things. Basically great game overall, it isnt for everyone sure but overall great game , could recommend. But and there is big BUT. The game technical state is awfull. And i am not talking about bugs. Look i got rtx 4080 and intel i7 13700kf and other components on par with them. So pc is not an issue. I invested so much money into it cuz i love gaming and i both enjoy old and new games but i want to enjoy the latest games at best possible graphics. So i did my part to squeeze the most you can out of hardware. And i feel like developers of this game did subpar job at the most enjoyable and stable experience you can get out of this game.  Denuvo, microtransactions and 2k launcher. Not full support for ultrawide screen and so on. And dont get me wrong there are workarounds for example for launcher and you can try to find other workarounds for other problems but no thats not gamer´s job. If the software only purpose is to slow your game and make it work worse then why even implement that software into whole recipe? So you can flex that you are 2k or just solely for the purpose of because you can? That one thing make that game literally unplayable cuz it was stuttering so much. After bypassing launcher workaround it got better but yea there are few stutters here and there. So i doubt launcher was the only problem. Frequent crashes , not full ultrawide support and other little things. Look i can forgive a lot. I can say that cuz i have A LOT of reservations about cyberpunk 2077 but i still enjoyed it to some extent overall. But if the game crashes , stutter and overall isnt as polished as it could be i cant really recommend it. I did my best to get best possible experience out of gaming with my pc. Did devs? Not really. I mean they got their money. I can safely say that they did their job more than adequate in that area. So what do they care about technical state of game? They dont. Thats why i cant recommend it. I go gaming to chill not to battle with issues the game has.  I would rather play worse game in other aspects but at least i can chill with it, not to battle with the issues it has just so i CAN finally play it/enjoy it to the fullest. I dunno. I suppose i could change review and recommend it when they polish it more. But i am doubtful. Its a shame really because i did enjoy the game and i want to play it.

Hydra have resurrected Lilith, a demon with godlike powers, and now the Avengers must team up with the Midnight Suns, and Lilith’s child, known as the Hunter, to save the world.

[h1]Combat[/h1]

•	During each mission you’ll choose a team of 3 heroes from your roster which includes Hunter (your main character, whose appearance can be customised in a detailed character creator), Blade, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, Iron Man, Magik (New Mutants), Niko (Runaways), Spiderman and Wolverine.

•	Each hero has their own deck of 8 cards which allow them to attack, defend, and perform special abilities which are unique to their skills, for example Captain America can use his shield to protect allies, Spiderman’s agility lets him hit multiple enemies, and Magik can use portals to move enemies around.

•	You’re usually limited to playing 3 cards per turn, however if you use attacks which have the “quick” modifier to finish an enemy on low health, you’ll earn a bonus action. Powerful special ability cards cost heroism to play, which is built up by playing normal cards that have no cost, so the order you play cards is important.

•	There are a couple of mechanics which reduce the impact of random draw. If you don’t want the cards in your hand, you can redraw 2 cards on every turn, while unplayed cards are kept in hand instead of being discarded at the end of each turn, which gives the player more control over planning your next turn.

•	During each mission you’ll be significantly outnumbered by Hydra soldiers or demonic enemies, and you’ll have to deal with multiple waves of reinforcements which can spawn endlessly until you complete the mission objective.

•	Some weak enemies will die from any hit, making attacks which can hit multiple enemies, or knock them into each other, quite valuable. More powerful enemies have large health bars and can inflict various negative status effects on your heroes. Shield bearers can stop you targeting mission objectives, and snipers are especially dangerous because not only do they deal high damage, they can also cloak which makes them difficult to hit.

•	You’ll also need to defeat powerful super villains such as Venom, Sabretooth, and Crossbones. You’ll face them in unique boss fights on story missions, and they can also ambush you as reinforcements during optional missions which you perform to gather various crafting resources.

•	At first I thought that being limited to 3 heroes per mission might result in some characters being ignored, but there are lots of missions so there’s plenty of chance to rotate your lineup. And bringing different heroes on each mission helps to offset the repetitiveness of the mission objectives. While most missions require you to defeat all enemies, occasionally you’ll need to capture an enemy, disable a bomb or vehicle, or collect loot.

•	There’s no Xcom style permadeath. If your heroes lose all health during battle, you’ll be unable to play their cards unless you revive them, which can be done a limited number of times per mission depending on difficulty level.

•	After starting a campaign on normal difficulty, higher difficulties are unlocked after you’ve completed a few missions. I increased the difficulty by 1 level soon after it became available. Each mission also has an easy/medium/hard difficulty rating. As an experienced deckbuilder player, I found most missions to be nicely balanced, although hard missions on heroic difficulty can be tough, especially if a supervillian joins the fight.

[h1]Abbey[/h1]

•	Between missions you’ll spend time at the Abbey which is your Xcom style base of operations. There are lots of activities to perform here, and I think my game time was probably split almost equally between combat and the Abbey.

•	Talk to other characters to advance the story. Many of your dialogue choices have light or dark morality points, which allows you to shape Hunter’s personality. Your choices can also affect your friendship level with each hero, and increasing this can unlock passive abilities and powerful legendary cards.

•	Craft new cards and upgrade them to more powerful versions.

•	Give heroes combat training to gain XP and get a passive bonus on the next mission.

•	Send heroes on text only side quests to help other Marvel characters and gain special card rewards.

•	Research new technology and improve facilities around the Abbey.

•	Heal heroes who picked up injuries after being knocked out during a mission, to prevent wound cards being added to their deck.

•	Customise character appearance with different outfits and colour schemes. This includes costumes worn in combat, and civilian clothes worn while relaxing at the Abbey.

•	Explore Abbey grounds to find secrets relating to Hunter’s past.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	Story is excellent and features lots of interesting characters. Dialogue is very well written, and there are many detailed sub plots which provides opportunity for every hero to feel like an important part of the team.

•	Its fun to see these heroes interacting with each other while off duty, whether they’re arguing about the best way to handle an upcoming mission, or taking part in various social clubs.

•	Voice acting is excellent. The cast includes lots of experienced video game actors, and Niko is voiced by the same actress who played the character in the Runaways TV show.

•	Significantly better than anything Marvel have done in film or TV since Endgame.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	It took me 70 hours to complete the story, which also includes a lot of optional missions and secret hunting.

•	The game is very unstable, but thankfully there’s an easy fix. I strongly recommend disabling the 2K launcher, and instructions to do this can be found on the forum. Before I did this I had 8 crashes in 8 hours, but since then I’ve only had 3 more crashes.

•	I didn’t have any problems with framerate or stuttering.

[h1]Monetisation[/h1]

•	While most cosmetic items can be unlocked for free using in game resources, each hero has some premium outfits that can only be bought with real money microtransactions. Their inclusion in a full priced game which also has a season pass is just pure greed.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

Midnight Suns is a fantastic game, which has enjoyable tactical combat, and an excellent story featuring many of my favourite Marvel characters. This is one of the best RPGs I’ve played, and is definitely a must play if you’re a fan of Marvel or turn based combat. However, I recommend buying on sale because of the crashes and excessive monetisation practices.",1684682594,1684682594,True,83,0,0.867380917072296143,3,True,False,False

*edit*
Thankfully the game is a lot more stable now. I play on Steam Deck, so that had an effect on the earlier experience, though with troubleshooting I had been able to get the game to work until a certain patch came out rendering the game unplayable even though it was rated 'playable' on Deck. Anyway, now it's veriified and it seems to work with only a few stutters here and there, but no crashing or anything.
If you like Marvel Characters and have wanted to ""spend time"" with them in a game setting, or see what they might be like off the clock, this game is a fun look at that aspect of things. Sure, the writing side has flaws, but it has some great moments too so far.
If you just like Marvel and want some strategy gameplay, you can skip the dialog pretty easily, but you will need to engage the social aspects of the game at least at the surface level or you'll be disadvantaged in combat, lacking the friendship bonuses and such.
If you want XCOM 3...I guess watch gameplay and decide whether this will scratch that itch for you at all, but you may be better off playing XCOM 2 more if you want XCOM.",1670727861,1684679916,True,0,0,0.508771896362304688,0,True,False,False

I bought the ""full"" game in December for 99 Euros.

Seemed like a tough price but I was trusting in Firaxis to deliver a good product.

That they did - story- and gamewise.

But not technically.

Now with the release of all DLC the technical problems like long loading times or crashes are fixed for me.

And:

No time limit!

Go as fast as you want and like with the content!

:-)

So I can recommend it.

Very much.

It is like a long Marvel Movie, where you are the Main Protagonist.

I like the mix of activities:

Tactical combat+RPG like progression, a good story, likable and often flawed characters and very much side content.

Get the full game.

If it's on sale especially.

I got my worth from it tenfold.

As of the time of writing I am around half-way in.

And I certainly had my blast with this game.

:-)

So then for the pros and cons:

Pro:

- Gripping story
- Likable characters 
- Avengers, X-Men and Midnight Suns combined 
- Huge amount of content to explore, tinker with abilities and enjoy the story
- Strategic combat where you need to mix, upgrade and then deploy your ""Deck of cards"" in a successful way
- Fully voiced even to the last bit of having banters between group members that are fun to listen by just standing next to them
- A definite Marvel experience! Each character has a ""personality"" and the talks to build up friendship are very fun and enjoyable

- Cons

- Full price may be quite high for some (but I can certainly attest the amount of content you get is more than good)
- People wanting ""only"" tactical combat may be disappointed
Why?
The dialogue part is a huge side of the game. And friendship levels from the dialogue enhance combat abilities. So you MAY ignore the side content and dialogue but side questing like exploring the abbey grounds, alchemy, tech-tinkering, Upgrading the Abbey have all meaningful effects. And you would miss out on much. Taking this only as a tactical combat game only may make it a dull experience. 
- DLC should be sold together as they give a whole new FULL story together. As they are connected I recommend to buy the season pass to get all. It definitely alters the game in the best ways possible.


As for me Firaxis delivered a true gem.

Beware:

It is NOT X-Com and it does not try to be.

If you take that and go in open-minded you will get a rewarding game experience.

And now I am looking forward to the second half of the game.

I certainly got all the money's worth from the content and much enjoyment from it!

Don't get turned off by the ""card game"" nature of it, as that is hardly what it is.

- You are rarely given new cards, making the deck combat system less interesting
- When you finally do get a card, 70% of the time you can't add it to the deck, because the system is very limited. You can't have too many of the same card or the same type. But most of the cards are garbage. And you can't replace them, just because the cards you do have spares for can't be added. 
- Very annoying open world. Nothing interesting, but the game wants you to look for garbage loot there. 
- The game also wants you to look for useless loot multiple times. At some point you unlock an ability that reveals something at specific hidden places, so you gotta go over the whole large boring map again just to find those places. Of course, there isn't any way to mark those places on the map when you find them the first time, so you just forget the exact spot in the samey forest where the small symbol is drawn on a fucking rock.
- A bunch of chests scattered around the map. Locked. Taunting you, because you'll never have enough keys to open them. When you do open something though, there's garbage there. This game feels like a mobile game that wants to manipulate you into buying bundles... But it's a single player game. 
- Very few different cards, meaning there isn't really much creativity or deck building at all. Especially considering you only have a few extra cards, and you can't add them to the deck anyway. 
 - Poorly written characters. You don't care about them at all. And they constantly do something really stupid, that doesn't make much sense. Or they get emotional for weird reasons. You just roll your eyes once again instead of caring about characters in this game.",1684351356,1684532436,False,2,0,0.480271279811859131,0,True,False,False

The missions are dull, with only about 4 variations and even then they all fall under the umbrella of ""kill the guy with the shield then destroy/play the card that lets you interact with the goal"". Through the first half of the game the only super villains you deal with are Venom, a lot, and then one off encounters with Crossbones and Sabertooth. The game loop is tedious with the Abby sections being very repetitive (which could be a criticism of the entire game now that I think about it) and not particularly engaging. And the card system is needlessly cumbersome, with the randomness of it meaning you will find yourself in a position of not having a good card to play far too often. 

The environmental attacks and knockback mechanics are actually pretty cool and add an interesting element to combat. Probably the most engaging feature of the entire game. 

Then there's how it actually plays. Keyboard and mouse support is hot garbage, numerous crashing issues, and enough stutters to make playing it more of a chore than something to enjoy in your free time.

Pros:
* The turn-based, card-based combat system is great. It has tons of interesting mechanics, interactions, and dynamics. It is a bit puzzle like (in an Into The Breach sort of way), such that it can be very satisfying when you figure out the perfect set of plays to turn around a bad situation.
* The whole game is very polished. Other than one crash-to-desktop the only bug I experienced was a missing line of audio from a dialog.

But also... Cons:
* For a strategy game, there is a lot of non-strategy part of the game. Way too much. I'd estimate that over 80% of my ~70 hours were spent listening to dialogs, farming components, and playing a weird hero-fanfic-friendship simulator game.
* The grind is real. You'll spend literally hours of the game running laps around the building each day, looking for little glowing resources that are 100% critical to upgrading cards to keep your deck relevant. As you progress through the game, you'll need even more resources to reroll random card mods till you get something decent.
* For a deck building game, they sure make it a massive pain to build decks! To break down unneeded cards you have to run to one end of the abbey, to upgrade cards you need to run to another area. You need to go deep into a character menu to unequip cards that you'll want to upgrade. But you'll need to fill in the deck while you have those cards out, then manually dig through the deck and your card stockpile to place them back in. Why not allow upgrading of cards equipped in your deck? Why not just have one tool for deck management, upgrading, modding, and disassembling??
* Nothing you do matters to the story. Sure there is only one ending, but that is fine. But every time I beat down an enemy boss, the cutscene is as if none of that happened. Beat down a boss... cut to a scene of your group cowering in fear of him. Beat down a different boss... cut to a scene of your group getting beat up, watching idly while he monologues, triggers his doomsday trap, and leaves. The conclusion to almost every boss battle was extremely unsatisfying.

Overall, the core aspect of the game (the deck building turn-based strategy) is very good, but the only way I'll be doing another runthrough is with mods. Namely mods that dramatically decrease the grind, in particular by bumping up resource collection, friendship gains, and removing bad card mods when you reroll them.",1684420661,1684420870,True,1,0,0.5071868896484375,0,True,False,False

The game really hooked me up when it was first tease. That Metallica trailer was so humphhhf, and when the hunter says « Mother! » in it, it gave me chills. I must have watched it 10 times before launch. And would you look at that, it promised a cast of marvel characters so original with less known superheroes. AND a supernatural theme as well!

I was so hype for this game!!! 
But the delivery was kinda mixed for me. 
Here’s why:


Good:


[b]MECHANIC 8/10[/b]

The mechanic of this game is simply awesome. Don’t just think it’s a card game, it goes way further than that. If you play harder difficulties you really have to plan every move you do, every cards you play, analyze your environment and your opponents. It was very fun to thinker about the best way to deal with the fights.

[b]MAIN CHARACTER CUSTOMIZING 7/10[/b]

Although the choices of templates for the male or female model is very restricted, there is a lot of options fashion style. From the hair to makeup to tattoos to clothes, there’s a lot you can do to personalize the main character the way you want. I just wished there were more costumes.


 Mixed:


[b]GRINDING 5/10[/b]

If you’re like me, I love grinding in games. Putting effort into grinding and seeing your team evolve for it, is very satisfying.
It was fun to build and try different cards combination with each character. By the end of my first playthrough I had the perfect build for every characters. What bumps me out is that the grinding is way to long to achieve what you want. You have to repeat the same missions over and over again. They could have slack a little.


[b]FREE ROAMING 6/10[/b]

In between mission you can free roam and explore the map. If offers some kinda cool exploration and things to do. But it gets boring real fast (basically walking simulator)

You can chat with your team after each mission. For marvel fans you can catch a few Easters eggs here and there. Other than that the dialogues feels kinda cringe from time to time. I surprised myself skipping some dialogues near the end of the game, WHICH I NEVER DO USUALLY. It became boring after a while.

I had fun though customizing my room and surroundings.


Bad:


[b]NG+ 1/10[/b]

Ok hear me out. The point of NG+ is to give longevity to a game and keeping the fun alive by letting you keep everything you did in your first new game and wanting to either complete and have everything or have fun with that you already had.

This game offers one of the most demoralizing and unsatisfying NG+ I’ve seen in a long time. 

-You have to rebuy every cosmetics you previously had (Long grind for currency)

-ALL of your decks and cards are reset (Again long grind)

-You lose every levels for every characters and you lose all the abilities you previously unlocked when free roaming

WHO DOES THAT?! Not fun at all

[b]SIDE CHARACTERS CUSTOMIZING 3/10[/b]

They all get 4 Costumes: their main, their ultimate you unlock near the end of the game and two others lock behind a season pass/DLC wall.

If you know your marvel you might want to have them but it isn’t really worth it.

[b]DLC 4/10[/b]

Each DLC offers a new hero with new decks for them, costumes for them, and 3 principal mission for them. Their content feels rush. There is a total of 12 missions for them and they are all terribly repetitive. They tried to incorporate them in dialogues between them and the main cast but it doesn’t feel right. Plus a certain points of the game they barely interact with others and feel like empty shells. The only reason I rate this a 4 is that I'm biased towards the characters they offer.

Also by the time the first DLC came out, I had already finished the game and the achievements weren’t unlocking at all for the DLC. The solution was to start a fresh new save and redo everything up to the point where you unlock the DLC mission. So I had to wait 6 months for all the DLCs to come out in order to do them all in one go. That was frustrating..

Short version. this game is amazing
------------------------------------------------
this game is incredible, all i wanted and more from my expectations. Gameplay, story, writing, collecting this game have it all. Sidequests, endgame content and other mysteries for you to discover. And A lot of in game cosmetics (non MTX) and shaders for combat suits. It's all but ""just a card game"" and the graphics is fantastic.

This game is Truly made by people who love comic books and appreciate the characters story and you can feel that with the tiniest detail in the game.

MTX doesn't matter since the best looking skins is in game unlocks and even if they do its 3€ for a skin instead of 49,99€ for DLC to get them all. 

(all negative reviews you see are just upset people who either wanted a new x-com or had no idea what they was going to get out of this game. have not had any lag issues nor do i complain about the MTX since its exactly what they said it was gonna be, skin related ONLY. (and you can get in game skins free too so you can customize your roster))",1669971249,1684247562,True,2,2,0.47084084153175354,0,True,False,False

I had avoided trailers for the game because I love Marvel, love XCom and don't like spoilers. This left me a bit surprised by the card combat system my first play through. I kind of rushed through it, not really paying much attention to building my deck or the friendship levels with the other characters. I was kind of disappointed that the game didn't have the same tactics structure of X-Com.

Now, of course, I have realized that it as actually similar to X-Com tactically. Instead of manuerving my sniper into position to take someone out, I am setting up Venom to clean out the minions with a chain attack while I build up my Hero points so I can play a hero card and take out an elite enemy. I am enjoying the tactically element of managing each characters hand and using them effectively to complete a mission.

Easy to sink dozens of hours into. My only real complaint is the forest area outside the hub is a bit too large and you'll easily miss a lot of stuff without a guide.

Still, excellent modern strategy RPG with a Marvel Superhero flavor and I highly recommend it. 9/10

great combination of turn-based strategi and superheroes.
i will freely admit that the story, altough feeling kinda fresh when compaired to what marvel have pumped out these last years, aint that great.
what is great about this game is the combat and the charachters you have to choose from,
and if youre a big Marvel fan like me then you will quickly notice that all of them have in some shape or form appeard in a live action project over the years, and there is enough of personality there to really start to like some (and respectivly really disslike some ^^)

This game is a huge miss for me, and I regret even paying the sale price of 50% off and wasting my time thinking this might get better after a few runs. Midnight Suns features the absolute most inane, boring and long-winded slogs in between encounters. It's like the writers thought they were so profound at writing fan fiction, that their shit was so good they had to shove it down our throats in large quantities between every match. The ONE good thing this has going for it is the individual heroes' card based combat choices. That one specific part of the interface really is fun and novel! Upgrading a hero's deck however, is still done through a really annoying interface involving running around and talking to people (which would be fine if they made it a little more interesting and efficient, but it's not). And the joy of playing individual card-based moves is severely dampened by the most boring and basic maps in which said moves are executed.

This game is a fried ice-cream banana sandwich. You like all the ingredients... but they aren't exactly what you expect.

Truly a not so hidden gem and worth picking up. Somewhere between XCom, Slay the Spire and Fire Emblem 3 Houses with a cast of Marvel Characters brought to life by all star voice over work.     *Yes, Critters --> the male main character is voiced by Mercer and the best member of the Midnight Suns (Magik) is done by a Russian Laura.*

But you said XCom, Slay the Spire and Fire Emblem 3 Houses? Those are three things that probably don't blend I mean, yeah, it's an acquired taste... but the gameplay loop does get there.

You have a lot (and a mean a lot) of slice of life interactions with the characters that reminds me of various jRpgs and aRpgs. You build friendship (???) with the marvel heroes through these interactions and this can effect combat?? Some of it does fall flat... but other stories really shine. I didn't know I needed to attend a book club with Blade, Captain Marvel and Captain America until... well... I attended the book club. Or how Tony Stark is a complete oversensitive dolt who can't help but offend the younger heroes of the Midnight Suns... and don't get me started on Magik's story. If anybody lays a hand on my little sister there will be limbo to pay.

Each hero has a deck of cards that you upgrade and build on as the game progresses. The card battling element is truly enthralling. They did an excellent job making each hero feel and play differently. They each have at least one unique mechanic. Niko has random Roulette, Ironman loves ironman cards, Blade makes things bleed... They are not incredibly well balanced but you can clear the game with any of them.

Right, the xCom influence can be felt in how you gear up your squad and mix and match your squad. When going on missions you'll pick 3 heroes and play all three of their decks shuffled together. This pushes you to find combos between the heroes. For example; Wolverine enjoys multihits and Doctor Strange can buff base attack so they combo. Or Niko reduces the cost of expensive cards so you can combine her with a hero chock full of expensive finishers.

All in all I had a blast on both my first playthrough (pre-dlc) and my return to the game (after I bought all of the DLC). 

If you do pick it up; don't do too many sidemissions. The game lets you continue to run sidemissions as much as you want. Yes yes, sometimes you need to take some time off from the story but if you over level too much it drains the fun out of it. Finish the game with at most 2 sidemissions between each story mission and you'll thank me later. New Game + or barelling on after finishing is a better outlet for your desire to upgrade every card and get every ability.",1684063555,1684063816,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I absolutely love this game. As a huge XCOM fan an comics fan this game was a match made in heaven for me. I would even go as far to say that this is Firaxis's best game yet. It runs fine for me with some stutter but not very often. Currently, I need to have ray tracing off to get the best FPS but that isn't a problem at all.

The combat is brilliant here. The addition of a card mechanic to the turn based strategy the developer is known for proves to be a compelling feature. The cards add a randomness to the gameplay and is great substitute for XCOM's RNG system. Every single hero is fun to play. Even if you aren't a fan of a certain hero, or even downright not like them, you will still have fun with each and every hero. The Abbey is also fun, being able to upgrade the Abbey an customize your room. Researching upgrades works similar to that in XCOM where each bit of research takes a certain amount of days to complete. Days work differently here than they do in XCOM as you can only pass the day by completing missions and other tasks then going to sleep. In addition, you are able to explore the Abbey and the surrounding area, opening up new locations to explore as you further along the campaign.

Now here is something that some people may love or not like as much. Half the game is building relationships with your teammates in order to gain combat bonuses and more. This involves talking with them, taking them to various hang out spots, and giving gifts. I for one love this. Me being a big Persona fan makes me feel right at home with this system and probably prepared me for it. It helps that the dialogue is well written, the characters highly likable, and the voice acting being top notch. This sort of thing may not be for everyone but it is well done here. If you are a big Marvel fan then this may be something you can get a lot out of as you get to hang out with some of the coolest heroes on the roster. If you can be open minded and try to experience this fusion of RPG, Sim, and turn based strategy elements, then you really can see that what the developers have here is truly special.",1670049510,1684028216,True,0,0,0.501684427261352539,0,True,False,False

1.  Don't be afraid of the card deck thing.  I hate card games.  Think of it more as the random number generator for the abilities you get each combat round.
2.  I like the superposition between the tactical combat, exploration of the abbey, and the dialog and side activities.  I wasn't expecting it to meld as well as it did.
3.  It's Marvel heroes, and some fun ones at that.  If you like smashing things, breaking heads and otherwise being heroic, this is the game for you.  It's also got some dark story line too, but I wore the white hat all the way through.
4.  There is a limited number of combat missions for variety.  At some point, you've seen them all and realize that you're going to be repeating the same missions.  This has dragged a little more completing the expansion packs after the main story was done.

I used other teams on + game and had fun messing around with DLC and awkward team comps. I want for people to play and support this game so we may get another (BETTER) version in the future. However, I cannot recomend this game on pc in it's current state due to the crashing!!!! I have never played a game with so many crashes! I have a beefy rig and can max settings on many AAA titles with descent framerates but this game is a stuttering, crashing mess! I had very little issue with most of the core game. Usually crashes occur when setting up missions or starting missions. Both DLC's have been a train wreck! I can't even play the Venom DLC because it crashes every five minutes. In Closing; This is an average game that punches way above it's weight. If they manage to fix the crashing issue I would definitely recommend it. Until then Just play Xcom 2 with mods and name your team after marvel characters...
UPDATE:
After uninstalling and reinstalling the game has not crashed in about 3 hours of gameplay. This happened before with Deadpool DLC. Not a great solution for those of us with less than 50mbps download.

The team building element is cool but hardly matters - there is rarely a point where one hero is necessary for their unique skill. All are very substitutable, and that takes away from that gameplay element.

What is unforgivable about this game is it has really good elements that are completely abandoned in the final conflict. The game goes as a repetitive but fun deck builder / team builder for 40 hours into 1 hour rng crap for the last fight that is unlike all the gameplay leading up to it.

Without further ado, I can say without a doubt that I haven’t enjoyed a Marvel game this much ever since [i]Marvel’s Spider-Man[/i] was released (although [i]Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy[/i] came very close). No wonder: [i]Marvel's Midnight Suns[/i] combines turn-based tactical role-playing with Marvel characters, and I absolutely love both of those things. Oh, and it’s all sprinkled with dating sim elements (although you can’t actually romance any of the heroes), and a fully customizable, original protagonist that you create yourself. Between battles, you can have long discussions with all your team members, give them gifts, do various activities with them etc., and all these increase your friendship levels with them (if you played any recent [i]Fire Emblem[/i] games, you know what I’m talking about). As for the battles, first I found the luck-based card system a bit frustrating, but I got used to it pretty fast, and in the end, I could even turn up the difficulty. It was really fun – however, I totally understand if this type of gameplay doesn’t appeal to everyone.

Unfortunately, the game was plagued with (mostly) minor bugs that are still not patched to this day. Most of them are simply annoying (framerate issues and lagging here and there, UI glitches, extremely long loading and saving times, achievements not unlocking), but I ran into a few game-breaking ones, as well. It’s a shame, because otherwise I have no complaints: the plot, in my opinion, is better than in any more recent MCU movies/shows or comics, the cast is superb (loved how they mixed widely popular, mainstream characters with lesser-known ones), there are many side activities, and even some replay value if you want to check all the outcomes in some situations, or take a different route while choosing between light and darkness. Graphics and music were OK, too, although nothing groundbreaking.

I feel like the game would be better on Xcom 2 style maps. The heroes crashing through buildings, getting a bit vertical with flying mechanics and the strategy of moving your team through the map definitely sounds more fun. Its kinda just these little arenas, like super heroes and villains only meet in nice little clearings to fight. haha. But who knows maybe some future DLC or expansion could play with that idea.

Besides the incessant talking at base, it feels like a minigame. Like Chimera Squad, pick a nonsense generic battle with random map objective etc, fight, upgrade base and soldiers a little, then do it again over and over. Enemy variety and strategies to deal with them are kind of minimal as well.

I clocked up almost 60 hours (58.2) and I didn't complete all the side-quests, I didn't max all friendships etc so it's pretty good value, the replayability is definitely there. I'm waiting for the season pass to go on sale and then I will be diving back in on hard mode.

The deckbuilding element is surprisingly fun, although can feel a bit annoying if you dont have any cheap cards come otu and don't have the energy to use a more expensive card. I'm not a card game or deck-building fan usually, but it synergises with the turn based gameplay really well.

It's a great blend of tactical turn based combat with deck building elements and RPG mechanics. Every battle is like a puzzle to be solved, it never gets boring, and continuously escalates. Every playable character is great, whether as a character or through their mechanics, or usually, both.

The social aspect of the game is very subjective, but objectively, it is executed well. I went into it thinking it would be cringe and annoying, and while some characters might be at times, there is a lot of character for everyone, and a lot of it is engaging. 

However, the best part about the game outside of the combat, is how all the mechanics within the game feed into each other. With so many different 'currencies' and resources in the game, it might feel bloated, but everything feels like it falls into place perfectly. Every activity in the game feels rewarding, where improving friendships will boost not only that character's but your own performance in battle, and every mission rewards you with something that always feels exciting. It's very rare in games to get that feeling so regularly. On a surface level, it can seem like a lot of it is filler, but none if it *feels* filler.

Except maybe reagent harvesting in the Abbey once you've already finished all the (completely optional) exploration parts of the game, but thankfully that activity is the most optional of them all. Some people will still enjoy running around gathering herbs, though, and I did for a time -- but after you've collected everything for a while, it'd be nice to have it be automated. Hopes for Storm DLC, maybe? :)

This game manages to combine the best of Fire Emblem & Persona's Social System, the addictive and game-altering card mechanics of Marvel Snap, along with the tense and thoughtful battles of X-Com and other RTS series. It isn't for the average gamer, but it was made for the strategy lover.

Each character's cards/moves feel unique and gives them an obvious purpose, but still presents multiple paths of play-styles you can define for them. The story and social system was so good that it made me more of a fan of the younger Midnight Suns cast than The Runaways series or New Mutants movie ever could.

The story was perfect, with a choice-based system that further adds variety to the gameplay. The collectibles and exploration are just enough to be rewarding without overwhelming. The ENDGAME, had one of the most fun twist and emotional stakes that I've seen in a while (especially for this genre).

My only complaint is that the hangout system felt unpredictable near the end of the game, which made maxing out the last couple of friendship levels a little difficult. Sometimes I'd get hangout opportunities back-to-back, while other times I'd go 3-4 days of general missions and night cycles before getting the opportunity. Just ended up with tons of cool gifts that I was unable to give :(. It wasn't enough to ruin the game though, and only a minor confusing detail.

I could go on forever, but I was really impressed and pleasantly surprised at how fun this was! To the point, that this is the first steam review I've been inspired to right. You can tell the devs poured a lot of love into this! Buying the Season Pass as I write this, and will definitely sink in more hours with the new characters. I hope they keep the new content coming with additional passes! 

P.S. Bonus Points that it runs like butter on the Steam Deck out-of-the-box at a steady 30 fps, which made playing through this even more of a breeze.",1683779669,1683779669,True,2,0,0.532987415790557861,0,True,False,False

Its gameplay loop is simple: Slice of life central hub > mission > slice of life central hub > mission. The closest game I'd compare Midnight Suns to is Fire Emblem: Three Houses. If you just want pure strategy, strategy, strategy or action, action, action, probably give this one a pass.

There are tons of classic Marvel plot holes but the characters pretty regularly acknowledge them (""Yeah, actually we've probably all died at least once at some point or another""). The story isn't anything to write home about, but it's good enough to keep you motivated to see the heroes through to the end.

My only gripe with this game is its optimization. Poor performance, crashes and visual bugs galore. Things like characters facing the wrong way during dialogue are pretty easily ignored after a few hours of playing, but that's no excuse. Performance-wise, some areas are worse than others, and astonishingly the worst performance I get is on the initial menu screen. If you start up the game and it's choppy, see if clicking New Game and playing works out for you. I can deal with dropped frames on the main menu. Crash-wise, I can't isolate the issue, but with auto-saves and the wherewithal to save frequently, I haven't experienced any colossal loss of progress. I've also encountered a handful of soft-locks, mostly in the training yard.

Finally, I just want to add for anyone just buying the game OR experiencing performance problems to first disable the 2K launcher or bypass it by launching the game directly from its executable.

When the game released, there were a lot of bugs. When the first DLC released, there were more bugs. It didn't inspire confidence.

However the underlying gameplay is incredibly fun. Talking to the Marvel heroes and gradually learning what their personalities are like, the things they enjoy and the qualities they like or dislike in others is incredibly immersive and the combat is super fun, you get a lot of diversity in the gameplay through varying hero builds and styles. 

At the current point in time the devs seem to have ironed out most of the kinks, new DLC releases aren't messy like they used to be, and each DLC gets better than the last. I am so excited for Storm's release tomorrow and I hope you buy the game so the devs continue making DLCs for me to buy!

That said, I love the game play. I love the combat and the voice acting is phenomenal! Not to mention I'm 60 or so hours into the game that it feels I got my monies worth. Not like Call of Duty where spend 70 bucks and all you do is the same rinse and repeat over and over and over and over and over again.
The combat is different, but very challenging. You have hero cards and can only play 3 a round. You need to really think on how you can maximize the kill shots with those three cards.
I highly recommend this game. I love that it is different that what is on the market right now. I would definitely buy a sequel!

The game has some cheesy moments, and in some places feel a bit shallow, and some times falls short with the humor aspect.  Some characters no doubt will annoy somebody, but it was still very fun and there can be found a lot of hours.

I'm truly impressed how well Firaxis was able to take that chassis, add in a pretty wide degree of customization, and still retain the elegance at its core.

Deck building stays blessedly manageable, with each character only allowed 8 cards in their deck, and the party's three characters combining those decks into one common one per mission. That gives just enough room to tinker with any particular character and to feel out synergies between heroes, without overwhelming you with the open-endedness of a dedicated deckbuilder. The strategy layer is a little bit shaggy -- its problem is mostly that it [i]allows[/i] you to waste much more time in it than is worthwhile -- but the Abbey ends up being a strong entry in pantheon of video game Home Bases.

Both of those are easily fixable with mods. And mod the game I did. At it's core it really feels like a mobile game. A very expensive one but grinding upon grinding upon grinding gets very tedious. So let's skip all that. Even if you have all the resources you still gotta get the cards to play. Thankfully you get those from missions but only 2 of your squadmates can earn a card so gotta decide who you want to raise. 
The saving grace is lack of pressure as opposed to XCOM games. You can keep doing general missions until you get what you want and level up your heroes. 

The heroes themselves are a mixed bag. Avengers are great. Even Captain Marvel is a proper character and a very wholesome one at that, as opposed to whatever Marvel did to her in the movies. The titular Midnight Suns, a bunch of ragtag teenager featuring Nico (the witch), Magik (the blonde with portals) and Ghost Rider... 
Man I really wanted it to be Johnny Blaze but nope. Some random dude I never met. Magic is one of the most annoying characters I;ve met in a long time. If they were going for a moody teen then they nailed it. Nico is fun to play around with but, once again, annoying during the story segments. 
Besides that there's Blade. Awesome but not as cool as Whesley Snipes version. They watered him down into a PG13 version of himself. 
The rest of the cast are alright. 

The game really wants you to like them and ptus all sorts of hangouts and deep conversations with the characters. Some are amusing, some are well written, a lot of them are well - cringe. 

There's a dog in the game. You can pet her and walk her. That's a plus. 
Graphics are great. No fps drops on my RTX 3070 with everything maxed out. 

Get it on sale. It's fun but you have to work for it with mods and patience. The card system can be frustrating. 
I would have preferred if they kept the XCOM formula and every character had set abilities or skill trees and you could take cover and move around the map.

It's an addicting, pleasantly repeatable (i guess a bit grindy) tactical rpg that really shines. I've put a lot of time into this game and it's totally worth it.
Gameplay is very fun and the combat allows for a lot of strategy and creativity.
I love the upgrade systems, they allow you to fine tune your favorite heroes to your liking.(I trained Wolverine's willpower to max so he heals even more like in the comics, and gave Captain America a massive amount of turn 1 block)
While some may not like all of the relationship building that goes into the non-combat portion of the game, I really enjoyed it as it demonstrated the developer's understanding of the heroes backstories and personalities. Plus you get to be best friends with Deadpool. What more could you want?

One grievance: I wish they offered an upgrade from the base to the legendary edition. Both editions were on sale when I first purchased the game. I bought the base edition.

Cloud saves are there which was critical. There is still performance issues on both Windows and Proton but its better. I think they have done enough to earn a yes from me now.

I think in the long run this will be a good game however its a bit of a mess. On the PC there is stuttering and some crashing.
On the Steam Deck which the game is rated as Playable, the situation is much worse at present. First there is no cloud saving for some reason which there is really no acceptable excuse for a company like 2K. Second and more damning is that the game crashes frequently on the SD and the only way to ""fix"" it is to use a third party paging file extender for linux. So if you thought this game would be great for your Steam Deck like I did, its a big disappointment until there is some official fixes.  

The game its self is fine, the dialogue is on the longer side and the abbey sections drag a little bit, I kinda wish that there was a 2d all on 1 screen hub, I am not sure what the benefit is of wondering around the abbey aimlessly is and wished it was a little more streamlined so I could get the next combat faster. 

Hopefully they will fix the issues and add some Qol stuff to allow the abbey be a little less of a road block.

That said, this game is pretty fun for what it is, just not as fun as a Marvel themed XCOM would have been. 

So anyway, this is like if Fire Emblem: 3 Houses had a 3some, with a card battler and Marvel and then 9 months later a really weird, but kinda cool baby showed up. Seriously, the similarities between 3 Houses and this are eerie. Main character is a legendary god-tier member of the team, despite basically showing up out of nowhere: check. Spend more time running around your abbey making friends, doing favours and talking than battling: check. Doing all that busy work because it buffs your party and adds layers to the gameplay: check. Running around grabbing random balls of light: check.

I find that the battle system is what I actually talk about least while describing it in person, but that it's not *bad*. There could be a lot more to it if they'd really wanted, considrering how complex XCOM is in comparison, but it works well for what it is. You have a team of 3 heroes (sometimes just 2, though) and each character has 8 cards in their deck. You have 3 card plays, 2 card discards (exchanging a card for another) and 1 move per turn, though if you play your ""quick"" cards well, you can often play way more than 3 cards in a turn. Every hero has a unique passive ability and quirk to their cards (eg Blade's passive has a chance to cause bleed and his cards do more things to bleeding enemies). The battle arenas also have a bunch of environmental hazards and items that can be used to control space and kill multiple enemies when used properly. Of the 4 DLC characters, Storm is not out yet as of this review, Venom and Deadpool are very good and Morbius is just ok. I get more out of his lab experiments ( character stat adjustment) than his time on the battlefield.

Overall, I'm enjoying this, but it's not for anyone wanting an XCOM experience. If you like Persona and Fire Emblem style character management, this might be more up your alley.",1683157275,1683157275,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I'm a fan of board and card games, and this game very much scratched my strategy table top game itch in a lot of ways. I think this game's biggest problem was that people didn't know what to expect from it, so let me try and sum up the experience. 

This is a collectible card game, influenced by RNG, and in all my hours, I still haven't collected a copy of every card in the game. Not to say there's thousands of cards, but I keep getting the same 5-6 for each hero over and over. You can upgrade these cards with multiple copies and add other abilities to them. In order to do this, you have to juggle a TON of different resources. By the end of the game, you'll probably have more than you know what to do with, but at points in the game, there might be some grinding to get all the resources for the things you want. 

This game is also a friendship simulator, ala Mass Effect/Dragon Age where you head back to base after every mission to chat with your crew and build relationships with them, and you'll get closer with them and unlock more abilities over time, as well as cosmetics. The Abbey is a pretty big area, actually, and there's a lot to explore and do. 

This game is also steeped in Marvel lore and the backstories of all the characters involved. You'll spend a lot of time in dialogue with the other heroes. Probably more so than you will actually playing the missions. Speaking of, the missions are tactical battles in which you draw a hand of cards from your 3 heroes and play them in order to do things like attack enemies, generate heroism for powerful cards, and buff and debuff. There's ways to play lots of cards in one turn, so you're trying to make the most of every hand. 

All that being said, this was legitimately one of my favorite games ever. I know I'm probably in a niche demographic of people interested in Marvel, card games, and tactical RPG friendship sims. But I absolutely loved this game. I was actually kind of sad to do my last lap around the Abbey before shutting it down.

Some other quick points - graphics are fine, not incredibly great. Thought I would get better frames on a 3080 at 1440p, and the facial animations are basically absent, ala Fallout conversations. The audio is pretty fantastic, however. The cast in this game is actually phenomenal, and top shelf voice actors all around. The music and sounds effects are great as well. I'm excited to see if they come out with a sequel, which I would definitely buy as well.

PROS - You're a huge Marvel fan
CONS - Everything else

If you're a huge Marvel fan, you may end up liking this game.  For everyone else it's super mid. 

Let's start from the beginning. In case you missed it in the promotional material, this is first and foremost a card deck building game.  Everything else presented to you, the player, is a facade of content.  Every decision outside of selecting which mission you want to play matters very little to the story or the experience.  The entire game is locked hard on rails and instead of streamlining the experience to the only enjoyable part (the missions) it forces you to manually proceed through the exact same series of events every single ""day"" in game in an attempt to cultivate ""relationships"" with other characters.  There's no real depth or complexity to any of it.  

The actual combat game play makes up probably less than half of your time played and I got about halfway through the story before realizing it was never going to change.  Despite the roster of available characters you only have the resources to even try and upgrade the specific decks of maybe 3 or 4 of them.  This problem loses a bit of it's severity because there are only maybe 3 or 4 characters worth using to begin with and there's only one good deck combo per character on top of it.  There are maybe 3 mission types and they're all exactly the same every single time.  Even with completely different teams of characters, the actual mission game play never changes because the majority of actions taken are environment interactions, not specific to character abilities.  

The story, I suppose, is subjective, but wasn't compelling to any degree. Particularly because of how cutup and distorted it was with how the game play was designed.  I didn't really care about any of it.",1683076085,1683076085,False,1,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

Honestly I didn't know how to react when I first looked at the game, but once I got into the meat n gravy of the game I was hooked. Simple yet deep mechanics, short beautiful skill scenes and a good story for being turn based. Plenty of backstory of characters I was previously lacking any particular knowledge of, giving me a little respect for the lesser known heroes. 
Tips:
Pet the dog daily
Collect ingredients around the abbey grounds nightly
Use the alter to gain gloss and buy new uniforms and corresponding colors.
Make the game as long as you want it to be! There are story mission then general missions and you are never forced to progress the story and will receive a prompt to start the final mission.

Cons 
-DLC is a bit expensive, I would prefer a 9.99 price point or less for the 4 characters and associated missions.
-Lack of enemy types
-Would prefer much larger hero pool with the possibilities of DLC campaigns, even 12-20 missions for a story with 3-4 characters will fetch more value for a 14.99-19.99 price point.",1683059639,1683059639,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR: A lot of talking but facial animations are bad. Gameplay is ok but not great. Only buy when on sale.

The biggest issue I have with it with thus far is that you spend more than 50% of the time in the Abbey, talking to other superheroes and yet, it seems, Firaxis didn't spend that much budget on animation. Yes, the facial animations are bad but not Forza Horizon 5 bad. It's like a game that came out 10 years ago. You will be looking at lifeless faces a lot in this game.

Combat is so far from XCOM. Don't expect something close to it. Special effects are reminiscent of arcade-style fighting games so that's good. The gameplay feels like a simplified board game. Uncomplicated. Forgiving, but I have not played on high difficulties yet.

Maybe my opinion will change as I play the game. We'll see.

28-hours gameplay update:
I'm at mid-game. You are supposed to be in a crisis, yet you don't feel it. XCOM and XCOM2 is way better in setting the stage of a crisis. Something is off in the way it is written. It's nice ""getting to know"" Marvel heroes though, so at least it has that going for it.

71-hours update:
I completed my first playthrough at 71 hours. Do note that I took the time to max all friendships to unlock each hero's Midnight Sun Skill and armor and to upgrade all the skills on each hero's deck. Venom was the hardest to max out as he doesn't ever seem to want to hang out. lol. 

The story is fine. I don't understand what people are complaining about. Sure, the last mission could have been grander and longer but it's not that bad. My only gripe is I ran into a bug where my fps dropped to 19. My normal fps is at 55-ish (RTX 3080 10G). It was fixed by reloading.

The writing, overall, is okay. Nothing comes as off or weird. Just take the game slow and not rush through it as there is SO MUCH DIALOG. Going through that dialog is kind of what gives that ""getting-to-know the heroes"" feel, which I guess is part of what the game is offering. 

Conclusion:
This is a good game but it lacks in a few aspects that is important for this kind of game:

I mean, inexistent facial expressions can be ignored in Forza Horizon 5 because it's a racing game and dialog with your character on the screen is such a small part of the game. 

Having lifeless eyes is reaaaally bad on a game with a lot of talking. 

Also, unskippable content - not good for grinding.

Aand, it's an apocalypse. It doesn't feel like it's an apocalypse. There is no sense of urgency. Cue in XCOM2 ironman mode. That really felt like an apocalypse situation.

Good game to buy on sale. I'm changing to recommended so Firaxis makes a sequel and hopefully improves on it.",1679994070,1683031210,True,0,0,0.471698105335235596,0,True,False,False

XCOM mixed with deckbuilding. 
Gameplay is smooth, fun and addicting.

The game is not optimized. I played cyberpunk 2077 with high graphics with great performance, but still can't have smooth game play experience like 3/10 times in this game. Sometimes the game freezes, camera goes wonky.

No doubt the marketing campaign, which features classic Marvel characters in unsusual magic-themed costumes, is part of the problem, duing a poor job of communicating what the game actually is. 

Midnight Suns is a card-based strategy game that takes elements of Slay the Spire and marries them to Firaxis' XCOM series of turn-based strategy games. As you play, you build a roster of Marvel superheroes—from Avengers like Captain America, Captain Marvel, and Iron Man to iconic solo heroes like Spider-man and Dr. Strange to X-Men like Wolverine and Magik and magic-themed characters like Ghost Rider, Blade, and Nico from Runaways. At the center is a new character called The Hunter who is a stand-in for the player—at first I had a hard time spending so much time with an untested character, but overtime I came to grow fond of her.

The story centers around an apocalypse being brought about by Lilith, a demonic villain who may be familiar to fans of Marvel's magic-themed characters. Between missions, you spend time at the Abbey, which is effectively the school from Fire Emblem: Three Houses, and in between missions you work on building up your friendship level with various Marvel characters by going on hangouts and doing chores for them. It's not quite a romance sim, but it's close. 

I wasn't the biggest fan of the relationship builder aspect, but I found the combat to be fun and tactically satisfying. Not as challenging as XCOM 2, but not so easy that it feels like a waste of time.

There are still a few issues (some bugs in the later game with non-story missions e.g. missing access cards for storage crates), some severe performance drops even with the launcher disabled, a constantly disappearing cursor when you're hanging out and exploring the Abbey but it's by far one of the best games I've played in the last two or three years. The voice acting is great (although some of the dialogue was described by a friend as 'cringe'), the metaplot is compelling, production values are really high and it works really well having a blank canvas hero supported by more familiar characters from the Marvel canon. The more social bits like hanging around at the Abbey with your team-mates was kinda reminiscent of hanging around with your squad in Mass Effect but with added social mechanics. Will definitely reinstall it and play again when a few more of the DLC's are out (the Deadpool DLC came out during my first run through so I was able to play those missions alongside the main story).

The writing isn't even half bad, it just becomes a chore since there's not even any real routing or strategy in your social approach, you simply check boxes and watch the most uninteresting protagonist of all time be fawned upon by Marvel heroes. The stakes are also completely retarded, with you having a talk about ""The Real You"" with Ms Marvel in a bathing suit, or organizing a surprise party for Magik while the world is being invaded by Hydra, vampires and demons. It's complete nonsense.

Then comes the battle system. Having 1 action by hero linked to a randomized hand of action in a tactical tile-less RPG is an absolute mistake. Even with the redraws, you can end up with a hand of card that is beyond useless and have above 1 star rating completely barred from you from the get go. Having one (1) move by turn for your entire team, which also doubles as a knock back, removes any sort of tactical depth to the game. Enemies WILL attack the character displayed above their head, regardless of the obstacles you put in front of them unless you use Protect. They will walk across the map to hit you regardless of the distance. It's an absolute parody and the entirety of the battle map could have been replaced by a Desktop sized still picture of your team taking a pose. Everything you do on it is something that could have been replaced with just another card: something they often do in order for you to complete objectives. You wouldn't want to actually control ground and objectives in a TACTICAL RPG would you?

Just do yourself a favor and buy something else. If you are a fan of Tactical RPGs, this isn't for you. It's an obvious cash grab tied to the Marvel franchise with no heart and no soul.",1682782681,1682782681,False,3,0,0.473648875951766968,0,True,False,False

The game strikes a perfect balance between card-based tactical combat and some lighthearted mystery-solving-chest-opening-runaround stuff. The story for the main game and even the DLCs is very well written, animation and facial animation, cut scenes are top notch. The difficulty can be scaled to match almost all play styles and player strengths. Voice acting is remarkable as you would expect from a triple-A title. I have spend 100+ hours for the first play through and there were not many dull moments. General missions can become a bit repetitive and less challenging but if you adjust the difficulty, vary your heroes and portion the story missions just right with the general ones you will not get bored.
New Game+ is a nice touch as the first play-through will definitely leave you wanting to try out different dialog choices, party compositions in main missions, etc. and NG+ removes the most boring and grind-heavy, time consuming parts of the game leaving you to enjoy the story again with different choices and tactics.
I sincerely hope sales will pick up for this title as I personally think more games of this genera are sorely needed to balance at least a bit of the mouse-killer action games and FPS titles dominating for a long time now.

Yeah, it's a little weird to be passing notes in class with Blade, but it's handled well and the whole thing is very well-written and it all serves a larger theme. Not saying it's not heavy-handed and cheesy, but it's a comic book story, it's fun.

Roaming around the abbey finding things is highly reminiscent of Mortal Kombat's various graveyard modes, with little surprises everywhere.

The actual combat is amazingly fun, both simple and quite deep. It's highly random, it's far from chess, but it's always fun to have that lucky combo of cards that just works out to wipe out all the enemies at once. Knocking enemies into each other is really the main mechanic of the game, making this almost a cross between Hearthstone and billiards. Which makes me realize it's a real shame the Hulk doesn't have any abilities (that I came across yet!) that continue the knockback over multiple targets so I can set up trick shots. The Hunter's Bladestorm ultimate feels like that - if positioned just right, you can control where 5 different guys end up. In my final battle, I used it to throw two guys into explosives that stun them, kill 3 or 4 others, and use the remaining 2 or 3 as projectiles to kill other minions, all in one shot.

Having played the Xcom games and the latest MechCommander game I was always left very salty with the missing on a very high percentage of hitting we all know what I'm talking about.   This game give a similar feel but  you don't feel like the game is out to get you killed with its mechanics.   Heroes will always hit unless the target has a buff to either let them evade or soak the damage. Additionally the deck building aspect gives each combat scenario and team composition a fresh new feeling of a sort.  Some experimentation and careful selection of cards and characters cab make it seem like a walk in the park or the worst long xcom mission of your life.  All this is just me talking about the mechanics of the game.  I am  a bit of a Marvel fan, leaning more X-Men than Avengers, and loved getting to interact with all the iconic characters available in the roster of the game with more characters to be released over time(yes as paid dlc but lets be honest the sales on this game were dramatically less than what they were hoping for at least to my knowledge).

On the offside the game still suffers from the same annoying issues XCOM games did too. Every mission with some conditions like ""protect objective"" or ""prevent enemy / object from escaping"", there are so many unskippable forced dialogue interjections all the time that occasionally I just put Netflix on the background and swap windows during them because it gets so tiresome when the Caretaker goes on a 100:th tirade about how important it is you do this and that or the mission fails.

I stopped playing originally before any dlc was released because the glitches and stuttering became unbearable.  I tried again after the third dlc was released and I do not seem to be having any issues now, they game is running alot better for me.  So that being said, I really enjoy the game and hope they expand even more upon it.

THE BAD:

This is a good game hampered by terrible performance issues.  I have to reload constantly and start battles over because of constant freezing, which is very frustrating.  I keep running into walls where the game will stutter and freeze at certain points making progress impossible without trying the battle numerous times and crossing my fingers I don't get stuck.   This game does not feel finished with such performance issues.  When the game isn't freezing, it stutters a lot.  If this is ever fixed, then I will change my review to recommended.

I also dislike having to use the 2K launcher to launch the game.

Lastly, microtransactions for a single player game for cosmetics is ridiculous, but this isn't a deal breaker, I just ignore it.  

THE GOOD:

I've seen complaints about the story, but I enjoy it.  It is what you would expect from a Marvel plot line.  I enjoy the character building with the down time activities (I didn't think I would at first, but it has really grown on me).  The interactions between various heroes is pretty entertaining as well.  I also like the voice acting and writing for the individual heroes,  and the range of personalities portrayed for the characters.

The gameplay is very enjoyable to me.  Slay the Spire and Xcom are among my favorite games, and this is a good mix of the two.   I think they did a good job translated these concepts into a single game.  The deck building is okay albeit feels limited, but the tactical aspect, base management,  and character development definitely combine to punch above any one element.

OVERALL:

I cannot recommended the game with such performance issues at its retail price.  Definitely get it on sale as long as you are prepared to slog through some frustration with the technical/performance side of the game. If these issues were fixed, I would recommend the game, but they are too frequent and time wasting, that I can't overlook them.

Once the technical side is fixed,  I would continue to buy DLC for new heroes and story, and would even hope for competitive multiplayer.

1) I love card/deck builder games.  I've played games like Hearthstone, Runeterra, Slay the Spire, Griftlands, etc., and enjoy that style of play.
2) I like turn-based games more and more, especially as I get older and my twitch reaction times have slowed down.
3) I enjoy story-driven games, and the main story of this game does not disappoint!  I enjoy Marvel movies/shows as well, so that definitely helps.
4) I also like the ""sims"" like aspect where you build friendships with the heroes while balancing your own light and dark sides.
5) The visual animations/graphics for the hero abilities in combat are a blast to watch as well!",1682448208,1682448208,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am an XCOM vet and I have enjoyed this game for what it is and I'm looking forward to finishing it eventually when that final character gets added.

Graphically it's beautiful, but with occasional stutters outside of missions [edit: The stutters are all but gone now I've moved the game onto my SSD and stopped using the launcher]. On the missions it's always fine, so it doesn't affect the gameplay, but apparently you should look up how to launch it without the launcher, as the launcher makes the graphics worse. If you're an impatient action fiend then this game isn't for you. There's probably enough chat to bore you to tears. If you like your action live, then this isn't for you, as the action is turn based. However, this is the best turn based combat game I've played, and I've played some of the good ones (including X-Com games, which it is a lot like), and it includes some features I've not seen before, which is very refreshing, leading to some WHOA, THAT WAS SO COOL! moments. The combat moves are beautifully done, very heroic and in keeping with the characters as you've seen them in the comics. Also in keeping with the characters as you'll have seen them in the comics is their chat, which is nearly all voice acted (the exception being the favours), including the Hunter's voice, and the chat they throw into the missions adds to the atmosphere. I really love voice acting, it keeps that suspension of disbelief in check and the overall immersiveness of this game is fairly high for a game with turn based combat based largely on cards. The cards are a great feature, not only randomising things, but giving you a lot of flexibility because you get to build your characters' decks, and if you're really in to min-maxing maybe even customise them for particular teamups. Overall this is the best game I've bought in a long time. Biggest possible deal breaker for me that you might not care about is that your hero, the Hunter, is not gender locked. They could have skimped and only paid a male actor, but they didn't, which is good, because if they had I'd probably have never bought the game. Representation isn't bad overall: Most of the characters are male, but there are at least 5, soon to be 6  (Storm is coming) female characters, and ethnically though it's mainly white Western characters there are Blade, Nico and Illyana, and soon Storm, and though your character only has one voice per gender, the available faces and skin tones can give the impression of assorted ethnicities.",1681652156,1682403882,True,2,0,0.517684876918792725,0,True,False,False

Overall, I would have to say I recommend it, though I'm not sure I agree with the $70 price tag (yet, I'm still relatively new to the game). Here's what I have experienced so far, and I'll update as I discover more. 
My first impressions were pretty dismal. I was vastly underwhelmed, and let me start by saying this is NOT you typical turn based strategy. I, myself, bought the game seeing that, and the fact it was made by the creators of XCOM, and I had certain expectations that were NOT met. However, once I gave the combat a chance, I discovered the combat is quite nuanced and has a rich potential for strategy - just in a completely newfound way. So, BIG first tip, whatever expectations you have for the combat, leave them at the door and you'll fare better than I did to start. Once you let those pre-conveived notions go, the combat becomes a nuanced strategy fest where you will happily start planning 5 moves ahead. its almost like 3D chess in its complexity (once you get to the nitty grittys). 
My impressions of the game within 30 minutes were that I just paid an astronomical price for what amounted to, in my eyes, a phone-quality game. The graphics, admittedly, are dramatically underwhelming for a 2023 release. hell, they're underwhelming for a 2015 release. (However, based on online reviews, it appears they make up for this with playtime length). I also fully recognize I was too quick to judge, and I'm glad I pushed past my doubts, as you will be, too. 
The story seems engaging, and believable within the marvel universe. I, personally, am getting a WILD kick out of having some traditionally underrepresented marvel heroes as party members. #TeamNico 
I'm not sure how I feel about the mission style gameplay, yet, though. You have your main base, that appears to have a vast explorable area (maybe too vast??), and the rest of the game is played out mission style. 
All in all, I would urge you not to judge the game too harshly. It is actually a LOT of fun, once you get into it, and the storyline is quite engaging. 
However, at present, I would also urge you to wait for a sale. $70 will still leave a bad taste in your mouth, and I am as of yet unconvinced it deserves that price tag.",1682403600,1682403600,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

A refreshingly different approach to turn-based combat with a strong plot, better voice acting than these kinds of games normally get, good graphics and great sound & music.

While it isn't as unforgiving as the XCom games, combat still requires tactical thinking and, although I'm only playing on 'Heroic' at the moment, I'm certain the higher difficulties will provide ample challenge for the hardcore players.

Complimented with a vast roster of different Marvel heroes, it is played between turn-based style scenarios and third person ones where you get to explore the Abbey, build a 'friendship' with other heroes, learning their lore and other things you might not have known about them and also unlock various customisations for these heroes. (Which do not require real money!!)

Despite my familiarising the game with X-COM, it is worth to note that it manages to pull itself apart by using mechanics such as Heroism and usage of the environment (such as using a concrete slab to knockback enemies into eachother, or exploding a barrel), paired with heroes utilising different kits suitable for different scenarios ensuring that you make the maximum use of your roster (instead of always using your favourite ones, even though you're more than free to do so)

It has its hang-ups and it is certainly not perfect, but it is pretty dang good. In that time, I have had 2 (maybe 3) crashes that made me reset. I have seen a few glitches, but these were/are not game breaking - one frozen ""dead"" enemy stuck on the screen, Venom and Morbius flying off the battlefield during attacks (this one is pretty frequent but unobtrusive and quite funny really - sometimes they just run off the field of battle and I have taken to yelling ""coward"" at their backs as they go), and the fact that Wanda will not leave her room at first despite having a mission for you (I don't think this last one is actually a glitch so much as an oversight by the developers and it does fix after proceeding with the main story line). 

One thing that has ground me down though, is the dialog. OH MY GOD! There is a TON of dialog. I hope these voice actors made bank for their services because I've played through the Final Fantasy series and am a huge fan of Quantic Dream's games so, I like a lot of story, but come on, guys! I gave up for the most part halfway through. I watch the main story pieces but the after mission chatter, backgrounds and friendship building just drones on and on. As I stated before, I have 128 hours and you could easily add another 50 to that if I sat through all the dialog - and I'm still not to the end! That's not saying I couldn't be if I pushed through, but I sat back and built and played rather than pursuing the story. 

But all in all, a solid card based, X-Comish game with elements of friendship building and exploration (I actually got a call-back in my head to Skyrim while collecting moonflowers at one point and the connection my mind made actually surprised me in this type of game). There is a lot to do and it is pretty darn fun doing it. The story is solid, if a bit cumbersome. All in all, a great game. And it frequently goes on sale - I purchased at 50% off for all the DLC - $50 in this day and age really can't be beat for this amount of content.

only dislike i would say is more of the pointless dialog you have in common areas ""abby"" there's a lot of dialog which doesn't seem like much when you first start but once you get to midish-game you've done the exploration of the map so 97% of what you do will be in the common area of which you will be speaking to people . 2% is upgrading, and 1% of selecting missions to go on.

so typically by mid game on this is what happens:

day starts > talk to X amount of people for X amount of time(time is really dependent on if you listen/read/watch everything if you don't and just skip maybe everything will take 5 mins) > do upgrades (pretty quick)> select mission and play it (takes like 10mins on avg maybe 20-30mins if near end game or higher tier difficulty to beat a mission)> come back from mission and talk to more ppl for X amount of time > sleep > repeat

as you can see there are two chat periods per day morning and night so before you start a misson and after...if you skip everything it may take 10 mins total of chatting...but you played only 10mins...you see why i say it's a bit much?

The deck-building mechanics are neat, and the way cards can layer onto each other and utilize the different mechanics is thoughtful and interesting. But the hub doesn't really offer a lot of chances to get creative with how you set up your teams. The characters all grate after a while because they're all some combination of immature, egotistical, selfish, and/or completely devoid of self-esteem, and this comes up ad nauseum over in-game *weeks* of social interactions. This goes on for so long that I have to think this was done intentionally and just not well executed, since one character shows up about 10-12 hours in and basically calls everyone out for being a bunch of brats.

Marvel favorite heroes join the team and you gain access to different cards to build a battle deck and develop strategies as you progress.

Gameplay: Gameplay loop is mainly the battles. in most you select a team of 2-3 heroes each with different abilities and playstyles. you get to develop their ""decks"" to determine what abilities each hero brings to battle and utilize different strategies and synergies to overcome the different enemy types. There are some side options to battles, with the time spent in-between each battle either exploring the grounds of the Abbey, a spooky horror-movie inspired space outside of reality. There are various secrets to uncover as well as bonding with your fellow heroes, developing relationships with direct benefits to combat performance as the relationships deepen. The battles are the stars here, but I did enjoy the initial exploration of the abbey grounds just as it was such a different feel. The relationship building could have used some work as it felt very forced and not as good as Persona or other similar games. I still found the overall loop very enticing and really enjoyed the battles, grinding much more than necessary just to play with different heroes and unlock all abilities. I do wish there was a little more enemy/map variety but that's pretty much my only gripe. 5/5 for me.
Story: The story is probably lifted from one of the comics, but I thought it serviceable but not really a lot of character development or well written support. The Caretaker in particular I found extremely annoying and many of the lines of other characters were pretty lame. I found myself skipping through those scenes that I could, and just sitting along for the ride when I couldn't. 3/5.
Music - Some nice marvel studios tunes every now and then but nothing memorable or engaging. I listened to iTunes after a while. While not music there is voice acting and I thought the voice acting was fairly well done but voice acting in games never really does much for me. 3/5
Graphics/Bugs - This was one of the first games that really pushed my rig - i've got a 3070RTX and fairly new laptop and this game heated my computer up. For the graphical quality you get I thought a lot of the models were very bland, so I was surprised at how hard this pushed the computer. There also were a few bugs here and there with enemies dying but then their corpses stood around, even though they should have disappeared. sometimes plays I made would not show any graphics and would skip to the end result, but mostly minor bugs. 3/5.
Fun factor - For me, I thought this was absolutely a blast to play. Jumped to one of my favorite games and I'd highly encourage others to play it. While NG+ leaves a lot to be desired I'll still be playing my current game when the next DLC drops and doing a battle every now and then just cuz it's so much fun. 5/5.

the cons

there are many

the combat after a while is pretty rinse and repeat they try  to keep it fresh but the games card mechanics limit the overall play style.

The sim feature is very lackluster and overall boring ( nothing like persona ive seen that referance in a few reviews.

world building threw side quests is painful the character also walks and jogs like hes  got some serious arm Rigor mortis while suffering a wedgie.

graphical bugs are all over the place when the abbey loads in mid game texture bugs mainly. this can be anything from the ground or lights.

graphics in general are not that impressive and they gave doctor strange a bloody satan beard it couldnt be any more bloody pointy.

The negative review is for two reasons:

1. You're forced to listen to and engage in witchcrafty bull. I don't want that and should be optional. Also, younger generations do not know to filter out of their brain the overwhelming amount of repetitive witchcraftiness in the dialog and voicing. Pure garbage.

2. Coming from Firaxis and being compared to X-com like battleplay - I expected way more than what is offered in the combat dynamic. There are no long boards, there are no real story elements except a couple quickies in the battles. Its just a few reoccurring arena like battle scenes with randomized elements (objects u can throw or jump or push)....this is not xcom like AT all, which was the major reason for deep diving it, false advertising by whomever.

With that being said....the strategic element (mostly the teambuilding) is extensive. Infinite levels makes me happy. Not being forced to always use the main character is nice.

Being able to bring the characters pet into combat was interesting, and at first didn't understand it, until I figured out how good Marked was.

The Abbey and the Grounds (minus the witchcraftiness dynamic to it) is pretty awesome, but there should be more. Hopefully it will get expanded upon.

Keeping visuals separate (mostly) from stats is great (like suits not having specific powers, forcing us to use certain suits, or worse forced purchases).

The recurring treasure chests using the gauntlet legends sound byte was a nice surprise.

Not too many achievements making it easily completable.

The New Game + Mode is nice for those who didn't play since launch. I was able to clear the game, and then restart with all that I had found and playthrough with all heroes in a better experience.

Wolverine...Tactical game - yes.

Please give a toggle for the Hunter when she uses her words of power so we dont have to hear the garbage over and over (ive muted the entire game because its so annoying).",1680670743,1681787911,False,1,4,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

But with every DLC and patch, the load times get longer, the graphics glitch out more and the game gets buggier.  Each DLC seems to be in worse shape.  With the upcoming Storm DLC, well this game has all the markings of abandonware. 

What's worse is with Denuvo Anti-Tamper the community that does enjoy and continue to play the game likely wont be able to fix it or improve it.  


-------Original Review--------
If a meth addict strongly recommends meth that doesn't mean it is good.

On an unrelated note I strongly recommend this game.  

If you plan on playing this game on Normal or story difficulty you can 100% ignore most of the friendship, crafting and collectible aspects. You can easily get a solid 20-30 hours out of this game and the mechanics you enjoy and hardly touch the ones you do not.

That said, if you want to get achievements, or challenge yourself, or dabble in the card modifications to see how strong of a build you can make... this game has absolutely zero respect for your time.  You will need credits for a lot of different aspects of this game.  And the most reliable way to acquire them is, being the heroic (or demonic) Hunter you are is to run around the Abby and search for spare change in the cushions of the couch or check the demon forge to see if said demon belched out a couple of bucks for you. And not every now and then either, every single morning and every single evening. On top of that the Gold, Green, Blue and Orange orbs will seamlessly blend in perfectly with the a myriad of mystical sparkles all over the place that use the exact same color.  Also if you turn on Ray Tracing these decoy sparklies will reflect in every surface making even more distractions!

I would be remiss if I didn't also point out the character creation.  Arguably the thing that has kept City of Heroes alive even today is its character creation where you design your costume, powers and play style! This game has none of that. You choose from options on a couple of sliders and that is it.  

I genuinely do recommend this game.  I have enjoyed my time with it.  But if I am being honest I would not be surprised to see this ported to mobile gaming as it seems to already be a stepchild of it.  Even though it is 100% a single player game they have Denuvo  which blocks Cheat Engine so you can't reduce the grind by increasing your resources.  You will be forever chasing credits no matter how long you've played, no matter how good at the game you've gotten the slow trickle of credits will remain a bottleneck because because every single card needs mods, to put a mod on it you have to spend credits (and other resources) and you get one random mod out of upwards of 20 or more.  And when you reroll the mod the price goes up. Getting 300 credits in a single day would be a good outing.  But you can easily spend 2500 credits and NOT get the mod you're aiming for.  

When you consider that each hero has 10 cards all of which need mods you can see how much like a grindy mobile game this feels.  As a 2K game I would not be surprised to see a cash shop added in the future.  Though I wouldn't expect it from Firaxis.  So its 50/50.

Again I recommend this game.  (If a Cash shop is added that will change).  But your mileage may vary.",1672788774,1681774893,False,0,0,0.552482008934020996,0,True,False,False

Voice actors - superb
Fanservice - good
Lore - good

BAD PART:
Grind - super bad
Repetitive missions - super bad
Unskippable hints and voiceovers - super bad
Unpausable cutscenes - LOL WTF RLY ?
No option to make ""fast animations"" or ""skip ability animations"" - super duper trashy especially for NG +
Unresponsive UI - trash
UI bugs - trash
Bugs - ok amount for 70 hours, but still...

FACE ANIMATIONS - OH LOL DID YOU HIRED ANDROMEDA TEAM ?)))))

OPTIMIZATION - BEYOND THASH
last battle - 2070 super + dlls performance on medium settings - 14 to 24 fps - rly ??????

Heroes upgradability missions - TRASH (especially for latest, right before final battle)

-----
this requiers alot of QOL updates. like AIO UI for all CENTER-FORGE-UPGRADES UI so you dont run around like postman.
map should indicate BLOCKED paths you discovered
you SHOULD be able to teleport from abbey
you should be able to pay money to LVLup fall behind heroes, or at least they should auto lvlup every 2-3 Hunter lvls

and so on and on

Personally, I respect Firaxis for attempting an interesting game and not make a design-by-numbers, straightforward cash grab.

from the same devs that brought us X-Com.
Game uses an unusual take on the movement mechanics (comapred to X-Com), your
super heroes use card-based abilities, environmental attacks, combos 
and one-shot combat items.
Battles are fun and sometimes tricky when you need to figure out how to get rid of the maximum number of enemies with your limited number of card moves and environmental attacks. Earn level ratings based on how many turns you need to finish a level.

Might not be for every turn-based fan out there since the game involves a lot of team-building, 
deck building, crafting, upgrading your ""base"", story elements and effort to make your team of super heroes 
stronger and stronger which is interesting, but sometimes can get annoying and needs
a good deal of time to talk to your gang, give team mates compliments or invite them to a hangout etc. .
How Hunter, the main character (no spoilers, but is not used to the modern times), 
deals with all the nonsense of the modern world in the game is beyond me :-)
But all in all it is fun, at least for me.
You can focus more on the battles if you want, hopefully not get under-leveld during the campaign but to battle that you can always do side quests to level up and earn stuff.

Even better, later in the game you can get a training portal where you can level up your heroes
(even if they fail the training challenge, and using combat items is temporary in there if you fail
the challenge) so if you are under-leveled for a mission you can level up there to your heart's desire. Of course you can do that too during side quests but there you might injure your heroes and/or use up precious combat items, and, you only get the level ups if you succeed
the side quest while during combat training you will keep your level ups even when failing
the training (which might be a thing the devs overlooked for the game mechanics or
used intentionally to give the player a chance to level up when under-leveled for story
missions).

So, all in all, it is an new and fun turn-based deck-building game
and for me it is the first such game in a long time.

THIS GAME IS NOT XCOM
THIS GAME IS NOT AN XCOM CLONE
THIS GAME HAS ZERO XCOM MECHANICS

because I see a LOT of that in negative reviews. Or even positive reviews calling it ""xcom lite"". NOPE. It's a strategy game that limits the action your characters can make by dividing them up into ""cards"" that you draw. Yes, you can make the ""cards"" better, more useful, or add modifiers to them that can apply status effects or heal/give block to your team. Why am I putting ""cards"" like that? Because HOW ELSE can SUPERHEROS powers all fit into a game - AND have any sort of balance?

CAPITAN MARVEL is in this game. By rights, she should be able to solo the entire game, while carrying the rest of the team on her back (litterally, not figuratively). But that wouldn't be as fun. So she's got limits. Hulk has limits. Deadpool and Wolverine can be knocked out in missions because their healing isn't as powerful as the comics and movies.

BECAUSE ITS A GAME

The way they balanced this is with ""cards"" that seperate and define the varius attacks into single things. It works

Another complaint I've seen is that the abbey stuff is ""bolted on crudely and adds nothing to the base gameplay loop other than adding extra bullshit""
I think these people can't read.
You see, in the abbey grounds (that you unlock slowly over the first 16ish levels of the game - ONLY IF YOU WANT TO (it's not required at all) have journal pages and things to look at that tell of Hunter's past and the last battle against Lillith and why they moved from Transia to Salem. If you can read. It's a rather rich history, given how little time you take to explore it. There's a TON of backstory there _IF YOU WANT. Still not required.

So yeah. There's flaws. The friendship game feels wonky, but getting to be friends with the others does increas their usefullness in combat.

As a fan of final fantasy tactics, fire emblem, and X-COM I think this is fine addition to the tactical turn based genre. Its not a perfect game by any means but the combat game play loop does a good job of keeping you engaged, having decent depth, and some very satisfying abilities.

The story is engaging and can hook you in if you're a marvel or midnight suns fan, not all the characters and story beats hit but overall is enjoyable.

Pros:
solid combat game play loop- decent depth
unique character archetypes to form different parties for varied play styles
fun and useful upgrades
Nice cosmetics
engaging story
great ability visuals
many difficulty levels with varied rewards
plays great on the deck

Cons:
some takes on characters may not be appealing to some.
slow burn start- similar to many jrpg's, Reminded me of persona 5 in that regard
UI could use some streamlining-cycling thru different menus during crafting/mods
3rd person exploration could be mundane for many- think of a more fleshed out krypt from MK
DLC characters- cannot unlock through game play, must unlock through wallet. though they are fun

I would recommend this game to those that are a fan of the marvel games and those that enjoy tactical turn based games.

- Tedious activities between missions that become boring, repetitive and kill the flow and vibe of the game i.e. fighting
- super grindy (if you're impatient like me)

The game sorely needs more cards. Heroes equip cards which determine the abilities they have in combat. 
Problem is, there's only barely enough variety for customization to matter much at all. You don't have enough options for there to be more than one playstyle for any given character.

Each character gets 10 cards (I think one or two characters get 11), excluding the MC, who gets more.
You equip 8 cards, and there's a 2-card limit for copies of the same card in the deck.  There's a *little* flexibility, but you're gonna be trying pretty hard to make a character build that isn't just the same thing over and over with a very slight spin. Initially I was quite excited by the prospect of NG+, but it doesn't really matter if you've achieved all you can possibly achieve by the end of your first playthrough. Each character basically has one build and you can throw in an extra copy of a card you like, but each character is pretty limited to a single approach to combat.
One of the most telling cases of this in my opinion is Dr. Strange, as his profile mentions he's a support character but has ""some of the hardest hitting Heroic Abilities in the game"". Which is technically true, but I expected him to have more than a whopping 2 damaging Heroics, one of which is a Legendary he doesn't get until max friendship level.

The game is also annoyingly unpolished in some parts. 
The first arc is fine, but after that there's a *lot* more mismatched dialogue, bugged-out camera angles, and weird animations. Stuff like character heads snapping into place during conversations, models not lined up properly to the environment so characters float around sometimes, etc. I've only encountered 1 or 2 bugs that forced me to Alt-F4 cuz the game locked up, but these cosmetic bugs are, to me, pretty ridiculous for a game they're expecting $100 for if you want all the content.

The basic gameplay loop is fine, and the combat can be interesting, but it feels shallow, especially coming from the devs of XCOM. The level design is one of the worse offenders here. I feel the environmental attack mechanism is sorely underutilized (there's objects in the environment you can activate to do damage), because it's just arbitrarily placed boxes, newspapers, etc. There's no vertical elements despite many characters being able to fly, wall-climb, etc. Levels rarely have anything resembling dynamic elements, and most battles are fought in what amounts to a circular or square arena with some boxes in the way.

It's not a terrible game, I was enjoying myself in the first chapter, but by the end of the 2nd it was beginning to feel a bit tedious seeing as there wasn't really any experimentation left to do in the tactics game. Not to mention the lack of PVP means that even if you fine-tune your character builds to make ideal ones, you'll still end up playing through the same missions over and over against the same enemies who, other than bosses, mostly have one attack.

In short, it'd be an okay game if it didn't have a $60 price tag with an additional $40 DLC. It would still need more content to allow for variance in how you approach the gameplay, but it'd be fine enough.
With the price tag on this though... I'd definitely wait for a %50 off or more sale.
It's like they cut out half of the tactical depth of XCOM and replaced it with a dating sim where you don't date anybody. If they added more cards for all the characters, I'd probably give NG+ a shot, but I'm not convinced I'll be doing that as it is.",1681459012,1681459080,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In general, I thought the game was pretty good.  The graphics, story line and actual combat were great.  The terrible part was the conversations with the heroes.  This game is made for 13-year-old Marvel super fans who want to listen to what blade feels about different books.  The forced socialization was painful, practically torture until I figured out how to fast skip it.  You do one mission a day, then come back and have to do all this stupid drama stuff with these painful conversations.  It felt like going to work.  

The woke stuff is not a prevalent as you would expect with a marvel game, its still there and obnoxious, but I may just not have noticed it that much since I skipped pretty much all the conversations, except wolverine of course.  That brings me to my final point, the voice acting was great, except wolverine.  I didn't know that the original wolverine actor from the 90's animated series was still around and working,  It would have been awesome if they got him, no offence to this guy, but having the most iconic wolverine voice would have been a huge plus.

The writing is great, the missions are fun, and the combat is a joy. I find myself losing hours to building my relationship with the mean Russian portal lady and finding the best superhero combos. However, I have a few gripes.

Prior to the main loop, in the ramp-up and tutorial, the pacing is slow and the writing is so stilted as to be nonsensical. You choose the ""joke"" dialogue option and say something that makes absolutely no sense to Tony Stark and maybe I am projecting here, but even the VO artist reacts like he has no idea what either of you are talking about, but reads his lines anyway. Feels like the ""jokes"" generated from an older version of OpenAI's GPT or something. Additionally, you are missing a lot of the mechanics that will later make the gameplay click, and all of the initial missions are ""destroy all enemies"", so combat feels overly simplistic and repetitive. Once more mechanics and variety are introduced, this feels a lot better. Also, the grounds are open from the beginning before you can do anything, so if you are a gamer in the habit of exploring before moving the game forward, you will waste a lot of time running around. You collect items with no indication of what they are for (it will be many hours before you have access to crafting). It would be a better experience if this was more gated-off until you could actually do something with the exploration/collecting.

The exploration bit does not get more fun as the story progresses, though-- the grounds are labyrinthine and absolutely lifeless. Sometimes you find a black cat that you can't really interact with (typical cat I guess) and a bunch of objects that are supposed to reveal the backstory but feel meaningless. The game lets you ignore this aspect, which I guess is the developers acknowledging that they made something deeply unfun. Also there are lootboxes that regenerate, and the game doesn't tell you at any point that these regenerate. Since you have an ""arcane knowledge"" skill that improves the loot you get from these boxes, I didn't touch them for the first 15 hours or so because I wanted to max out my return. I missed out on a LOT of loot.

My biggest gripe is there is no in-game way to gracefully fail a mission. If you accidentally start a procedurally-generated mission with the wrong combo of heroes, all wounded from previous missions, and without the right items, you cannot just take an L and return to camp. I would be fine-- in fact I would love it-- if when I had a TPK, my heroes were out of commission for a few days and I got a scolding from The Caretaker. No, you have to retry until you win or until you load a previous save, which feels like save-scumming kind of pulls you out of the immersion. Save-scumming is REQUIRED here.",1681313862,1681313862,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat wise, it's not as easy as I expect a 'typical button mashing Marvel game' to be, very technical, lots of things to do. Lots of planning for each move. As expected from XCOM developer. You can't just slot in your 'fav' characters into the team. For example, I can't put Deadpool, Wolverine, and a DPS build Hunter in a team and expect them to steamroll my enemies in a higher difficulty. There's chemistry and you got to find right characters for each team. I had lots of fun figuring out which team suits my playstyle.

Game can be grindy, and also overwhelming for some, however I'm able to enjoy the process because it felt rewarding. You have to grind to unlock more skill cards, to upgrade or get duplicate skill cards or adding mods require resources, buying battle items requires resoruces. There's a few form of resources where you have to grind separately. Which can be tedious at first, especially I'm the type of person that loves trying out new skills for every character, so I got side tracked from Story mission and unlocked and increase relationship level to unlock more skill cards. Want new skill card=grind for cards mission, then no money? Grind for money. Want to upgrade/mod cards=grind essences. Want to craft skill cards=grind blueprints. Want legendary skill for each character? Gotta grind their relationship to a certain level. Want to 'brew' battle items? Gonna walk around Haven/the area outside of your 'home', to collect materials. and many more. Mostly it's a one time thing. Once you unlocked or upgrade or mod your skills, you don't have to do it anymore besides for other characters.

Well, at current time of my gameplay of 50 hours...I'm not sure how far I am into the main story, I've unlocked 6 legendary skills for my characters(less than half unlocked) and gotten all skills cards and mods for my unlocked characters. That's how much I enjoyed grinding them. There's still 2 more characters for me to unlock from Main Story.

Suprisingly each character is fun to play with, at first I there's some characters that I'm not a fan of or the first battle I had with them, they were pretty boring. Due to some side mission (general mission) I'm forced to play the character, as I unlock more skill card, all characters are very fun to play with.

If you like Marvel characters and want a game where you can build friendship with them, with a great turn based gameplay, I'll highly recommend this game.

Forgot to mention the DLC. Not worth getting it at their original price. Bloody short. Like, an hour gameplay just for the DLC story mission, that's baut it.

The majority of people will find the game fun, but some may take issue with the lack of customization of the main character, the hunter, and may find that the game lacks some features they are used to such as a mini map or compass in it's attempt to encourage unrestricted and independent exploration.

Don't believe the hate. If ur a marvel fan, and you are open minded to new adaptations of characters, and a different type of experience that is outside the rpg norm for superhero games, youll love this game.

I see a lot of the negative reviews talk about how there's no quality of life features, and I just don't get it, personally. Sure, there's no minmap for exploring the abbey grounds, but important destinations can be fast traveled to (almost instantaneously mind you), and you can mark things like chests on the map. I think the ability to just place markers wherever you want and have a minmap would not only clutter the screen and take away from the minimalist beauty that is the strategy portion of the game. You're meant to TRULY explore... this isn't a game that will hold your hand through it. 

As for the combat, I find it extremely rewarding. If you do well enough or progress far enough, you unlock more difficulties. You have a base difficulty and mission difficulties, so there's even more options within you difficulty in general. For example, im using heroic I difficulty currently, but i can choose between easy, hard, and normal missions, creating an even more modular experience when it comes to how hard things will be for a mission.

I would say the only downside to the game is the customization of your own character, the hunter. The other heroes have just enough, but it feels like the character creation system is pretty lackluster for the hunter especially off the jump. You eventually unlock more suits, color schemes, etc for your hunter, but its still extremely lacking in hair choices, face customization, etc. This is a very small moment in the entire scheme of the game though, mind you. Despite all that, your character can make moral choices while talking to the other heroes, which unlocks powers, costumes, and collars (an accessory that will modify and or enhance your playstyle by adding a passive ability) that you can only get by earning some level of that morality, light or dark.",1681253793,1681254907,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wanted to like this game, it has everything I should like. I love Xcom and I love deckbuilding games and I love Marvel. But this just ended up being boring for me. Too much ""fluff"" and game play was either repetitive or really punishing and rarely at the sweet spot.

Positives:
1) Core game play is good
2) replay value/variety of decks/heroes is good

Negatives:
1) The amount of ""fluff"" per mission is insane and a huge time waste. Do a 10min mission, spend 20mins talking to characters about how the mission went. You have to physically walk around the abbey to find/talk to people /research/heal etc whereas most games would have these as ""locations"" you visit with a click or 2. I don't mind a little plot, but the ratio is just way off.
2) There's just no peril. Compared to similar games, there is no ""risk"" to any decision and no ticking clock. Want to save the world after 40 side missions? Go for it. There is no risk/reward for anything you do.
3) Linked to above, and this is both a + and - I guess - the enemies scale with your levels(and maybe something else?), which I generally approve of in some games, but in it means there's also no inherent benefit to getting ""stronger"". Got a upgrade and now do 30% more damage? Guess what all enemies now have 30% more health.
4) There is plot 1 level very near the end of the game that has a bug (or if it's intentional it's a dick move) that means it can be impossible to complete, but you only realise at the very end of the level when it fails you at the final part. I had to google why the mission failed me and found threads all over about how dumb this was. This is lazy design and a waste of time.

If you like wandering around an Abbey collecting stuff and talking to people and then occasionally going on missions then you'll probably like this. And the ways you can min/max your deck/squad etc is really interesting. I did ultimately finish the game, but most of the time was just stubbornness for wanting to complete it rather than really enjoying it.",1681165730,1681165775,False,22,4,0.549025952816009521,0,True,False,False

Fraxis Games, those behind the reboot of the XCOM Series has done an awesome job adapting some of their genius game play mechanics from their previous titles into Marvel's MidNight Suns. You will find yourself wishing you had Dr Strange's Eye of Agamotto & its Time Infinity Stone, as very quickly you will realise that hours of your time have passed before you even knew it; as you Spin webs, Spell cast & yes, Smash & Slash your way through the games immersive story missions and semi-addictive looping side missions. 

The Story itsself is pretty good and builds the further when you explore the abbey grounds, develop bonds with your Avengers styled Teammates (The MidNight Suns) & progress through the major missions of the game. At times the odd joke falls short, or a story beat doesn't deliver quite right by the voice actors / animation but for a hybrid turn based strategy come RPG, I think what it pulls out of the bag is impressive.

The graphics is golden and your special abilities that you use to dispense of your foes is pure graphical eye candy, The Musical score makes you feel like you were an Avenger & the game ran pretty smoothly to boot on my ageing rig. (I5-600k, 16Gb Ram & 1070 Graphics Card)

I did have my doubts on how much I'd enjoy this game, i do love the MCU, (but never really played a Marvel game prior). & I love Fraxis's XCOM series, So how would their love-child fair in its-self?

Well I can safely say my expectations were not only met but exceeded, Don't take my word for it however.
Dig out your favourite fluorescent spandex, spend 20 minutes drumming up a cool Super-Hero Identity before settling on your Steam Name, Pay for what is a pretty solid game & Join the eclectic crew of the MidNight Suns.

Firaxis Games has a long and storied history of making AAA quality Turn-Based Strategy Games. The XCOM & XCOM2 series' being a huge success over the last decade. While this is NOT a Turn-Based Strategy game it does something that I find highly unique by mixing an action based comic mystery with an XCOM ""Style"" tactical battle map where your favorite Marvel Heros can through down with Hydra and Lilith. 

Let me be clear this is NOT XCOM2 but for those of us who have logged hundreds of hours on those destructible battle maps will see the unmistakable similarity. Where I think this game really shines is the top notch comic book flavor and interesting writing. Comic heroes and villains are about style and they have really stripped down some more of the tactical complexities of the XCOM series to bring this comic book style to the front of the stage. 

Instead of a cornucopia of abilities to manage you have 3 types of cards; (""Cardifying"" all manner of games seems to be the hot trope of the 2020s. I chalk this up to a new generation of game developers who developed their love for the genre with games like Magic: The Gathering, and Pokemon, instead of BattleTech and Dungeons & Dragons like I did.) Skills, Attacks, Heroic (Attacks).  Your ""Hand"" is only 8 cards so you really can't call it a ""deck"" and you must have a minimum of 2 of each type of card in your hand with two edition of your choice. Cards can be upgraded in all manner of fashion as you progress through the game and take Heroes into battle with you. Different Heroes are better at different roles so Dr Strange is Skill-based Support, Captain America is a tough-as-nails Attack-based Tank, and Iron Man is a Heroic-based DPS who has a knack for multi-target damage. This is an excellent example of taking what appears to be an oversimplification and really making it interesting with mixing and matching heroes and cards together to find what you like. 

The second part of this unique mix is your traditional Action/Adventure 3rd person RPG mode. ""The Abbey"" is your base of operations and you will spent ALOT of time exploring the grounds for clues, building relationships with 12+ heroes you get to interact with to get additional combat bonuses, playing ""Hero Barbie"" and reading/watching the story unfold. I have to say there is a TON of dialog in this game. The graphics and cut-scenes are top notch and what you would expect from this developer. Some may find that this part of the game too much ""chit-chat"" and running around playing fetch. I have been a comic geek for over 30 years. I am at approx the 50% mark of completing the story and it really well written and fun. I have found myself laughing out-loud that the comments and banter between the heroes. This is where Firaxis Games really shines with the licensing of these characters. I think they nailed the personalities, traits, and interactions of all these heroes perfectly. It may be temping to ""Rt Click"" your way through all the dialog and skip the Haven and Hangout interactions to cruise on through the content but if you know these characters like I do you are rewarded for taking your time and getting immersed in this part of the game. 

I have really enjoyed my time with Marvel Midnight Suns. This looks to be a great new franchise for Firaxis and I am excited to see where it goes in the future. XCOM2 vets will recognize the ""Photo Booth"" functionality in this game. I think it is much better placed in here because it will randomly generate a comic book cover for all of the mission you go on with your team of three heroes. This has a limited but entertaining amount of customization that allows you to tweak to your liking. You can even have it converted to a ""Canvas"" to hang around the Abbey which I though was cool. I always appreciated when playing missions in XCOM2 seeing posters of those pictures pasted on buildings by the ""Resistance."" It is these little touches that makes this game fantastic!

Beneath the very fancy look of the game are number of design choices I'm not a fan of:

1) strange friendship mechanic that feels off. Most discussions seem like they came off a mindfullness course book, not different personalities the characters are supposed to represent or conversations most real people would have.  

2) Gamification, gamification, gamification. Tons of tiny credits and points the player is made to run after in the between fights at the abbey. Chests that open with keys that give loot. Special premium points one is actually expected to put actual money into. The list goes on. Most of this stuff makes this game feel like a cheap free to play mobile game with nice graphics added on top. 

3) Fights are fun and can be challenging, but at least at this very moment, they have come rather repetitive. Asides boss fights with some marvel villains. I have only seen hydra soldiers that do not come in much variety and are somehow able to damage captain marvel or iron man with their guns. 

Overall. I am enjoying this game and will finish it. But lot of suspiciously ""looty"" design choices , at times really really gringey dialogue and the hero gallery make this a game that one should only buy when it is on sale. Preferably under 20eur.

FInal boss encounter was pretty meh and the deckbuilding aspect was kinda lacking cuz theres not THAT many cards you can unlock per hero so theres not a whole ton of variety. I guess to be fair they kinda had to cuz the abilities that a hero has are not SUPER open to a ton of variety but still. 

Abbey exploration stuff felt kinda wierd and tacked on and I dont really care about cosmetics so it was overall kinda pointless waste to do outside of finding the friendship spots. Game also kinda felt a bit annoyingly padded and grindy forcing you to do generic missions between story missions and having rng attached to card modifiers that gets increasingly costly for no reason to reroll.

It adds an element of randomness that increases the need to plan your strategy in advance, and allows for you to adapt each hero to work together.

Cons: Game is badly optimized , extremely long loading times ..experiencing flickering and extreme frame drops no matter how i try to set .. and there's no pause button for any cut scenes or conversations ..
Character design is really horrible compared to today's gen graphics.. You can't even see any emotion in their faces . 
Gameplay is really hard til you reach high levels where you finally have good cards to combo with

This is basically the PG-13 version of ""Coon and Friends"" from South Park.
More like Chimera Squad than XCOM, when it comes to combat and maps (smaller).
About the same level of abilities/upgrades. Though you can mod and upgrade them further in this.
A lot of side activities, character interactions, dialogue, lore, and etc. Like more than I've seen in any other game. Which is mostly optional/skippable if you don't like it. 

50% off, Yes.  Full price, no. Here's sorta why.

The dlc appears to of been cut straight from the game and resold to you after the fact. If they were 5 bucks each, fine. They're pumping them out way to quickly and they fit in perfectly with the rest of the story beats. The last part is great, but it goes to proving the point this was planned cut content. 

Some of the complaints you'll find in the reviews, are pretty valid depending on how much you're willing to put up with.  In my opinion, this game was meant for a female protagonist in mind. Why do I say that? Well just look at the journal entries or how everyone talks to your character (and the cover art). Weird compliments, gal pal attitude, and the dudes all fawning over you. The character was meant to be a Mary Sue like the rest of the female cast. Again remember this is coming from someone recommending the game. All the male characters are overall, weak, fragile and whiny (almost all the characters are whine bags). I mean Blade..is a lovestruck puppy for fucks sake...lol WHO STARTS A BOOK CLUB! to get closer to a chick..lol. (obligatory no hurt feelings get out of jail free card usage - There's nothing wrong with book clubs or dudes being in them...but this is fucking Blade lol...). This isn't the Blade that met up with Pearl is all I'm saying. 

So anyway, why am I recommending it? I don't give a shit about the marvel universe or what's happened to the characters. The developers of this game spent a butt load of time on putting lore, dialogue, little puzzles and  extras in that it's kinda crazy. If you played the dragon age series or mass effect series, and ever thought...man I wish I could of gotten to hang out with or gotten to know these party members more, well? This game has it in spades. 

The best part is, almost all the complaints about the game are entirely optional. You don't like whiny little miss (there's no misters cept maybe venom and wolverine (Eddie doesn't count)) no fun bags? Ignore the character, be a smart ass to them whatever. Exploring the abbey grounds...mostly optional stuff. 

I dunno, if you look at this game as being an amalgamation of the past few decades of pop culture - lovecraft, twlight, harry potter, and a splash of dragonborn from skyrim (shouts). And maybe not a marvel super hero game. It's pretty good. 

The combat could use some work, but this game appears to be made from the team that did chimera squad. If you've played that you kinda know what to expect here. Small maps (though highly detailed - like the out of bounds areas too) and limited combat options. Think of each fight as a small little puzzle challenge. All the characters have similar move sets, so bringing one over the other really doesn't matter.

Sure some fit more of a support role, or single target damage roll, or tank ....or or..yada yada..but most fights will be over in 2-3 turns so it doesn't matter. For the ones that might take 5 or more turns, sure the variation might help, but those are rare. Some of the boss fights can even be done in 2-3 turns. Since the objective is just to beat the boss...ignore and focus them..puzzle complete, game won, many awards given, gratification reward received puppy happy now.

So yeah, I don't know. The developers put a lot of work into the side activities of this game and it's pretty amazing. I may not be the target audience for it, but I can see that effort, where so many other games are lacking this side of game play, it's kind of refreshing. 

So how is this like xcom? Well it's more like Xcom: Chimera Squad really.
You've got research, ways to upgrade your abilities, injuries, you can get new squad/team mates, turn based combat. And yeah, on top of that all the characters that handle those job roles can be conversed with further and even brought out into battle with you. Feeling like your base is actually lived in (unlike xcom). Plus you can walk around in it. That's about it for that.

So anyway, I think I'm like half way through the game at this point?  I may expand this review once I complete the game. Thanks for your time.

Oh also, performance stuff. No major issues, first time startup didn't work but after that no crashes or issues there. However, during some information screens like when sparing - the framelimiter seems to stop working and the gpu soars, whirring up like it's pushing 3000fps. That could be what's causing some systems to crash. Basically, higher voltage is being sent through the gpu and causing the system to shut down to prevent damage. Think of it like unintended overclocking.",1680834373,1680834849,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let alone people who make him smoke outside? Pfft. And the writing for the characters is as if people just wrote them after reading a three sentence biography.

Then there's the game play that has the illusion of depth. It can be fun to build up your characters, but the variety within those characters is not deep at all. One person's Dr. Strange at 25th level is going to likely be almost exactly the same as another guy's Dr. Strange at 25th level.

You must manage enemy attacks and your own skills and abilities if you hope to survive. Utilize your environment and your heroes strengths and cover their weaknesses with the heroes your choose to bring to each fight. Discover the history of the Abbey, the home base of the heroes.

Pros:
Mind over RNG (your choices will make the game's mechanics work in your favor)
Hero selection matters and each feels different
Artwork/Graphics/Animations all made each ability feel good
Storyline is engaging
Music is on point
Customization options for those unsatisfied with the base models

It's about as good as comic book writing can get, and it gives you the experience of being a self insert fanfic character in a world threatening Marvel cross over. It lets you build para social friendships with Marvel heroes in a manner not unlike the Persona series or Fire Emblem or Mass Effect, without impressing me as much in that regard as any of them. It lets you play a deck building game, but I wish there were more cards for each character.

I really do think they employed a good solution to stale JRPG combat problems by introducing cards to combat. Instead of approaching every turn the same way, on account of always having the same suite of actions, the card element puts you into the mindset of approaching each turn based upon the randomly influenced and evolving lines of play available to you, but I was never truly astounded by it.

All in all, I think it needed another pass earlier in design to refine the core gameplay loop of combat, to flesh out the Abbey and give more places to go. It's all a little stale and samey, and I don't think that the length of the campaign was served well by the fact that so much of what you do in the game is just the same over and over. It's a nice game to pick up for an hour here or there, but it never left me with the feeling of being excited for playing more than one mission at a time. Which is fine.

Some elements have been added to draw more casual players (such as collection quests, reagent hunting, exploration and friendship interactions), which has unfortunately diluted the otherwise solid core tactical experience.

----

Marvel's Midnight Suns is a rather unusual use of an intellectual property. The core gameplay is entirely tactical. Unashamedly so. You command 3 heroes in combat using cards to attack, repositioning using the ability cards you've drawn (as well as a single free move action) in order to utilize environmental hazards to gain an edge. Casual gamers attracted to the Marvel intellectual property who were expecting an action-based experience may be turned off by the very tactical turn-based gameplay.  I mean, it is a Firaxis game after all.

Having said that, don't expect any Slay the Spire combo wombos here. There's little in the way of draw and additional card play management compared to that title, much less emphasis on blocking, and no infinites to speak of. The card synergies are much simpler compared to StS. Gosh, I never expected a big studio Firaxis to join in on the StS bandwagon.

Does the core tactical gameplay work? Yes, actually. As much as I often gripe that most game devs really don't justify the why they're using a card-based system well enough, the emphasis on interaction with the 
 environment and positioning makes up for lack luster card management. It's what happens outside of the core battles that's kind of the issue.

You see, in an attempt to draw in more casual gamers, some elements which are unusual to strategy and tactical games have been added. In order to find the resources needed to upgrade cards and get an edge in combat, expect to spend a lot of time exploring the grounds of the main base area. Ever picked up reagents in Skyrim? You'll be doing a lot of that, except you don't have an open world to explore and instead will be backtracking along the same paths and gardens in order to search for reagents have have randomly respawned. Optional? Yes, but reagents are used for items and card upgrades. It's too useful to be ignored. And to reiterate, the idiot reagents respawn RANDOMLY.  It's a time sink and not a welcome one for strategy gamers.

The other aspect which makes actually good use of the intellectual property is the interaction with the various Marvel super heroes. Well-known superheroes such as Captain America, Spuider-man and Wolverine are all lining up to make friends with you and hang out! Choose the right gifts, the right words to say and you can romanc... uh, befriend your favourite heroes from the movies and comic book!

Again, not exactly the cup of tea of most strategy gamers, but at least it's fairly well-written for the most part. Just ignore Captain Marvel's Mary Sue depiction (""My big problem is that I'm too perfect! Boo hoo!"" ...Seriously, writers?) and Magik. Especailly Magik. Magik is *just* like she is in the comics, if you know what I mean. They needed to have some youthful energy in the game, and apparently the only personality trait the young are allowed to have is being uncooperative and rash. Thanks, Boomers.

It is really frustrating to have such an emotionally intelligent, story driven playable comic with phenomenal voice talent get sold as a XCOM clone with a Marvel stamp. And all those XCOMers that didn't get the clone they wanted, talked crap online when they found out it was a card play strategy game.

But in all honesty, Midnight Suns is full of defaults. They may not break the game (although...) but they still destroy a big part of the fun.

Let's start with the least important(in my opinion): graphics.
I played this game on the highest quality possible. And yet, there were quite a few ugly things: Peter and Tony's haircuts that look like hair from a Playmobil, Hunter's was barely better, Logan's body hair that made me think he got assaulted with a sharpie, the whole cast's faces, the cat Ebony's body and several others.

Next, we have the two main parts of the game: the interactions mechanics and the fights mecanics. While the later can be considered correct, if a bit weak on several aspects, the former feels rushed. Every character sings the praises of Hunter very quickly and lots of characters appear obnoxious in their behaviour. And that, when they're not downright contradictory: one day saying this, the next one saying the opposite (looking at you Robbie).

Then the bugs. Sweet baby Jesus, the bugs. I'm not sure even an early access has that many. It goes from texture bugs(dissapearing map, Abbaye's walls looking like they're covered in colored postits,...) to models bugs( dissapearing bodies, frozen ennemies, heros hitting the air yet still reaching the ennemies, Wanda's energy still stuck to her hands in the Abbaye,...) along with sound bugs(out of sync with attacks, game stuttering during each and every Limbo transition when Hunter replies,...) or simply crashing, multiple times. I even think the latest update worsened them.

And finally, what utterly destroyed my love for this game. I could have ignored everything mentionned above. Just, not giving my opinion on this game, good or bad. But there is cosmetics. Cosmetics you can only buy with real money. That, along with the fact you need to litterally pay the same price as the game to have all the DLCs, is simply unacceptable. I know Disney, and so Marvel too, are losing money nowadays but that's no excuse to give us an unpolished, expensive product.

There is still a lot of things I could mention. The lack of character's animation in the Abbaye, the 'dancing' clothes when the camera angle changes, the attitude of some characters that made me want to slap them. But that would be overkill.

At least, you can pet the doggy. I guess it's something.",1680457383,1680457383,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The deck building isn't overly complex and is easy to pick up what to combo and strategies that work best, of which there are many avenues to pursue. This is because of the fairly large amount of characters, card upgrades, and card modifiers. Some characters are definitely stronger than others overall, but they are all usable and fun to play each in their own right. I would guess people gravitate towards different types of heroes and team compositions.

The story and social gaming aspects are fun, though the type of animation doesn't 100% fit the feel of that half of the game sometimes. However, I really enjoyed fleshing out rest the story by exploring the abbey/hero base grounds and finding everything I could about the midnight suns lore. There are large benefits to battles by engaging with the story and its characters in between missions, which I really liked.

The dog, Charlie, and cat, Ebony, are both cute as hell ;)

Graphics are great, it's pure marvel, the voice acting is for the most part pretty decent, and the mix of deck building, upgrading, and turn based combat is awesome. And the abilities and effects are superb. Some bizarre FPS slow downs when there is a lot of wreckage on the field, particularly later in the game. If the battlefield had a lot of rocky destructible objects it would typically mean my FPS would decrease drastically. Though, this only happened and was noticeable in 5-8 or so battles I had.

As far as the outer game goes it's a total mess. You have some terrible scripting dragging you through some unimpressive cutscenes through to the ""abbey"" (secret base), where your main character has to move around in order various rooms in order to navigate what is essentially a menu system. You then have really bad dialogue to engage in with other characters and some exploration of the area to be rewarded with extra battle items.

Overall this whole ""outer game"" is a drain on your time before you can finally get back into the amazing ""inner game"". The actual flow of your game is: ""wake up cutscene"" (three separately skipped cutscenes to sleep and wake up each day) -> walk to menu point -> operate menu (you have 3 different things to do after each battle) -> skip through dialogue (at least it's skippable) -> do mission (the good bit) -> do a ""hangout"" (more dialogue) -> pet the dog -> go to sleep.

Combat is a slog, having to sit through the same unskippable animation every single time you use an attack.

There was a lot of stuttering as well. I am running great specs that run most games buttery smooth with no issues. This game lags on the MAIN MENU!

It's also one of those games that won't LET you do basic stuff until the tutorial holds your hand through the process over a lengthy amount of time. Would you like to reposition yourself in combat? NO. We haven't shown you how to do that. You need an entire turn, text on your screen, and pictures telling you how to move first. THEN you are allowed. Rinse and repeat for every single aspect of a traditional turn based combat system. It treats you like an idiotic child. Which is exactly how I felt when listening to their dialogue, or watching characters do a flip in slow motion like it's supposed to be the coolest thing I've ever seen.

If recognizing images of superheroes is all you need to enjoy a game, then this is the game for you. There's a huge roster. But don't expect them to say anything thought provoking.

PC stuff: this is the real issue, from horrible peformance to not working features regarding raytracing, I didn't crash at least nor encountered nasty bugs.

edit after ending the game:

For those suffering the dreaded ""insufficient virtual memory"" crash, this is how I worked around it (before this method I tried anything from lowering graphics,doing alternative stuff and none worked) these lines might also stop your hitching and increase peformance allowing you to boost graphics (I personally crank graphics way past its limits using my unreal engine knowledge )

The strategy card game, the meat, is a lot of fun, but it's a bit rough and unbalanced. This game would be so much better if they expanded, tuned, and polished the cards and the combat instead of spending all the development resources they did on the other two major parts.

Exploring the Abbey is enjoyable enough, but the rewards are lackluster and once you get all the words, there's not a lot of incentive to keep exploring. The best use for the arcane chests is just to search them out when you dip beneath 50 credits to find enough to do daily sparring. Exploration isn't bad, but it's unnecessary given that they could have spent the time and resources on the meat of the game to make it better.

The dating sim part of the game is the bad part. Midnight Suns unironically does what South Park: Fractured but Whole did satirically (and better). The dialogue trees are rudimentary. The dialogue is bland and repetitive, and there's way too much of it. It wouldn't be so bad, but the ""social"" system is both the method for upgrading the PC's stats and unlocking the Legendary card for all of the heroes. It's not skippable.

Correct it is not XCOM 3. I love XCOM 2 + War of the Chosen and I love Midnight Suns.

It is a 5D chess board where every move is calculated. 

How efficient can I make this turn? 
Where will I end up?
Is there an object I can interact with?
And so on

Know what you are getting into. The battles are absolutely fantastic. Very in-depth deck building system. Every character feels unique and brings something to the battlefield. If you are a comic book/Marvel junkie...This....Is....Your...Jam....

On a battlefield level I compare this to Into the Breach. Every move is a calculated execution to the 9th degree. 

I am only a surface level, movie level, very little comic book level Marvel fan and I absolutely fell in love with all the characters.....Oh you didn't like X character.....that's because of good writing and they are playing their character. Seeing the Heroes we know during the *Down time* as just people is refreshing. The human element. 

If you aren't into Marvel Super Hero building then yes this game will come off as Cringe and awful. I feel like even if you are a slight fan than this game will shine and give you 100+ hours of fun. Great voice acting (some original cast) graphics and animation seal the deal for me on this one.

When the game was first announced I was super excited, love Firaxis/Xcom, big fan of Marvel, and was hopeful that as a Marvel game it would be a big budget AAA affair.  My enthusiasm cooled once I found out cards were involved and the game was not a traditional strategy game.  The game released and I was busy with other stuff and heard some vague stuff about performance issues so I just let it pass me by.  The publisher did a free weekend recently and I am glad they did, I tried the game and loved it, and bought it the next time it went on sale.  

Midnight Suns tries to be a lot of different things at while it suffers for it, there are a lot of high points as well.  Thats really this game in a nutshell, it aspires for a lot, and in doing so leaves itself open to a lot of criticisms and nit picks, but when you pull back your view, you realize, overall, it is a great game. 

Midnight Suns is a game with two very distinct parts, the missions themselves, and the time spent at ""The Abbey"" between missions, socializing and preparing for the next mission.  The missions are flawless.  The strategy gameplay is awesome and everything you would want, the graphics are fantastic, everything looks and runs great.  I misjudged the card based gameplay, it is superbly done, deep and flexible.  I was very impressed.  

The Abbey however is much more of a mixed bag.  You spend your time there interacting with your teammates, exploring the grounds, editing/upgrading your decks and watching cutscenes, oh so so many cutscenes.  First off, the engine for this part of the game is pretty rough.  Everything looks pretty nice, but it is nothing special, and especially with ray tracing on, is extremely demanding on your pc and does not run with a consistent framerate even with DLSS assisting.  Its as if the engine was made for the battles and then the Abbey parts were shoehorned in later.  You also spend a ton of time socializing if you choose.  You can participate in hangouts with various members, and do group activities as well.  All of this raises your friendship levels with the characters, and every time you gain a friendship level you have another dialog scene with that character.  While not poorly written, per se, there are certainly moments in the script where people are acting way out of character.  For example a plotline where Blade is like a shy schoolboy with his crush on Carol is just bizarre.  It seems wildly out of character for any iteration of him that has existed.  I understand that these characters exist in their own continuity, and may not be exactly like their MCU or comics counterparts, but this was egregious.  In fact, this most often happens in spots where we are dealing with grizzled, veteran heroes, acting like rookies/neophytes/teenagers whatever.  So much so, that my ""no facts involved total guess theory"" is that this game started out as a Strange Academy game or something, or possibly a non Marvel game entirely, and the heavy hitters (spidey/wolive/cap/iron man/carol/etc) were shoehorned (there it is!) in later.  I do want to be clear that the script is absolutely, unbelievably massive, so some stuff like what I describe above would make sense and be forgivable, but sadly I just found it too egregious.  

I fell deeply in love with Midnight Suns once I started playing, the game starts strong and the first chapter is fantastic, with interesting, difficult gameplay.  Sadly, somewhere between 50 and 75 percent of the way, I ran out of steam pretty badly and began to tire of the game a bit.  If you, like me, do side missions to make sure your friendship is high, you become overpowered pretty quickly.  The card unlocks and upgrades start to matter less and less, and therefore the currency you get for completing missions starts to not matter as well.  The game encourages you to turn up the difficulty, but the reward for doing so is just a greater amount of currency that you don't really need anymore anyway.  Also, there needed to be more enemy types, more locations, and more super villains, it began to get so samey.  Due to this I did not play any more once I got the credits to roll, and I did not purchase any of the DLC which I found to be pretty pricey.  I may have checked it out if it was cheaper.

So yeah, I certainly had some issues with Midnight Suns, but its highs are super high.  I don't like the idea of knocking a game that really goes so hard for it in some places rather than just playing it safe, even if it doesn't always get there, so I am not sure how to rate it.  I greatly enjoyed.... MOST of my time with Midnight Suns but not all of it.

Also to touch on the elephant in the room. You don't need to watch the films or read the comics to know what's going on in this game. There's references to events that have happened in the comics, but they're all throwaway lines. Anything important (character relationships etc.) is usually summarised in optional dialogue. But honestly, you'll be fine even if your marvel knowledge amounts to ""Iron man is that flying robot guy right?"" 

All in all, for someone like me who loves turn based games and the golden age of Bioware, this was brilliant fun and I highly recommend it. It was an iffy start with the tone, but actually as it went, the game very quickly pulled me in and by the end I cared about everyone in my little superhero haunted house.

(Also only the other day did I realise that they referenced that insane 50's or 60's comic, where Iron Man goes to ancient Egypt to fight some Romans and fall in love with Cleopatra. Why wasn't that the plot of Iron Man 3? Disney you cowards.)",1680001589,1680001589,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

4) Story dialogues give a false impression of making choices. Literally none of them make any difference and still lead to a terrible ending that's more of a middle finger right to your face.

In the few hours since I switched it off, I haven't had a single crash (normally only get 30 mins to an hour before crashing). I cannot confirm if it was to do with frame generation or just DLSS, but it's the one thing that's ultimately made the difference and I'm hopeful this remains so. This does mean the game is not as sharp as it would be with DLSS turned on, but I'd rather a stable playing experience than having to restart the game every hour before crashing. With this in mind, I'm now happier to recommend the game if you're OK not using DLSS (though this should really be fixed). The game play is quite addictive especially as you unlock more attacks, making it easier to string together abilities. I'll leave my original comments below for context.

Original post: This game was more than I expected in that it's more than just an XCOM like game, with a home environment to explore and several different systems for levelling, including your friendships with heroes. I was really enjoying the game play and could feel my heroes getting stronger in each battle as I levelled them up, which in itself was a satisfying feeling. Unfortunately, this game suffers from crash after crash after crash. The game would crash on me within an hour, every time without fail. I've tried several troubleshooting tips, all of which have not worked. After looking up online that I wasn't alone, and seeing as it's the only game on my PC that has issues with crashes at all, all signs point towards an issue with the game itself. I'm disappointed to say that I've given up on playing it, at least for now. I will feel tempted to get back to it every so often, and if this issue is ever fixed, then maybe I'll edit this into a positive review as I really do enjoy playing it.

Pros:

- generally very good writing and voice acting. I enjoyed the social side of the game, interacting with the other heroes between missions. I genuinely came to care about some of the characters, and it's inspired me to buy comics featuring them.
- the combat gameplay is fun. The card drawing / deckbuilding mechanic means you're not able to have a single strategy, you have to adapt to the cards you have in hand. The ability to knock your opponents around, forcing them to crash into each other for damage or into environmental hazards never gets old.
- risk vs reward calculations. Your basic attacks build up heroism points, which your more powerful abilities (and some environmental effects) require you to spend to use them. Do you go with low-cost, less powerful abilities, or do you save up for one big attack. Different characters have different cards for their decks as well, so what works for one character might not be a good fit for another.
- overall excellent presentation. Between the music, character models, voice acting and scenery, it feels like ""MCU: The game"". It lives up to the production values of the films, and almost feels like it oculd be made into one.
- Charlie, your pet hellhound is adorable, and you can stroke her.

Cons:

- it wasn't unusual for the game to crash on launch for me. Restarting the game always worked, but it was annoying.
- Long load times
- Occasionally clunky / glitchy camera, and this caused a few crashes as well.
- Exploring the grounds of the Abbey (your home base) between missions isn't very interesting, and the collectables & crafting ingredients you can find don't have much effect on the game.
- The game tries to influence you to do the social and collecting activities between missions, but this ends up feeling like filler.
- The game also tries to influence you into completing battles as quickly as possible, giving you the highest rating for a fast finish. However, this means the game is trying to push you into not playing the main bit of the game, a very weird choice. A couple of times, I managed to complete a mission on the very first turn; this was great for the rating, but I wanted more of the combat that's the most fun bit of the game.
- New mission types do unlock as the game progresses, but there's still not a huge variety. You'll be playing the same missions over and over again.

Overall rating: 7/10

I enjoyed playing through the game. I may well play it through again, especially once all the DLC is released and it's possible to get them in a good-value bundle. In a way, this game is quite similar to the MCU films - not the greatest product ever, but a fun way to spend some time.",1679931622,1679931622,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One aspect without the other, and the game wouldn't work as well. As it is, there's a very satisfying gameplay loop. There's also an exploration aspect around your abbey headquarters, in nature, as a bonus that I liked, but that can be ignored most of the time.

My first impressions weren't great, I thought the graphics were a bit lacking for a AAA game, while still decent, but they did grow on me as time went by, especially the character models. Combat animations were brief and spectactular. Graphics in the battle fields were very good.

I'm not usually a fan of strategy games with card decks or so-called card battlers, but this one won me over. It becomes quite fun once you get the hang of it. There's depth and variety while also keeping things relatively simple. I particularly loved the knockback attacks. The field of battle is limited in size, this is not X-Com, but I thought the size was appropriate: not too big or too small. Every playable hero plays different and there didn't seem to be any clunkers. In fact, I was surprised how much I played every single hero, even though I had my favorites.

The social adventure aspect, where you build up relationships, is wonderful and obviously inspired by the Persona games. There are clubs to attend, hangouts with individual heroes, an electronic social network, and you see heroes talking to each other, training, lounging, etc, in your headquarters. It's mostly talking with a few choices here and there, but it's very well written and interesting, especially if you're a Marvel fan. It's the superhero game where it feels like I learned the most about the characters, perhaps not in term of histories, but in terms of personalities and what makes them tick.

You play as your own new character created for the game, the Hunter, male or female with customization options, and it was rather well done. He was cool, had a great voice (don't know for female), and I liked playing him. I also liked the story, not as much as the friendly character interactions, although the store page unfortunately spoils a few big things if you pay attention. The voices were mostly very good and well chosen. Highlights were Nico Minoru (played by the Runaways tv show actress), Blade (played by movie Spawn) and Captain Marvel, but your preferences will vary.

I can't go into everything, but there's a lot I could have written about, such as the text-based hero ops, levelling your card deck for each hero, decorating your room, buying clothes, creating battle items, buying gifts to offer and, of course, exploring around the grounds. They make for interesting distractions, make the game richer, and you can mostly ignore the stuff you like the least.

What I disliked was the lack of enemy variety and super-villains. For the first 30 hours or so, I mostly fought Hydra goons (think modern Nazis) and I got sick and tired of them. Then you get another set of enemies that are more interesting. Super-villains are few and far between, although they're well designed and fun to fight. Another thing I disliked were the constant enemy reinforcements appearing almost every turn. They quickly grew tiresome. I get it was probably done to keep the challenge up and to surprise, but I could have done without it or at least not as often. Last thing are the super-hero costumes, beyond your own, locked behind a pay wall with real money. They're cosmetic, there's only two extras for each hero, but in older games they would have been unlocks. As it is, for each hero except yourself, you get one initial costume (with a choice of unlockable colors) and the Midnight Sun costume near the end.

CONs: 
-Runs like absolute butts most of the time. Even after disabling the 2k launcher (highly recommend looking up a YT vid) sometimes it still gets hit by huge frame drops. Semi PRO: When it is running it looks great and even on low to get the best frames it still is a great looking game.

- Bugs. I personally haven't experienced very many game breaking bugs but I have seen others report lost saves and such which for me personally is devastating. It is hard for me to pick up a game after losing a save and this game doesn't deserve that. There are currently achievement bugs which the Achievement Hunter in me hates but that doesn't affect the game. Other than some visual bugs, the game runs pretty good.

- The game should maybe explain some abilities better or give you a better idea of the end result of something OR give us 1 undo per turn or something. So many times I go ""IDK if this is how this works"" and then it doesn't. An undo would be helpful at least at lower difficulties.

- The rewards for a higher difficulty are not worth it. I enjoyed setting my own difficulty and sat on the highest I could go for most of the campaign and now that I am in ACT 3 and all my characters are max level there is no point to hoard the gloss or try to grind levels. Yes there is champion levels but it is such a small increase per level and it still takes a lot to level. So instead of being on the hardest (Ultimate 3) and taking hours to defeat a supervillian I backed down to 2nd hardest (Ultimate 2). If there was an increase it loot or loot chance then maybe it would be more worth it. Even on 2nd hardest the abilities of new mobs make the game really challenging.

- Resist does not work against supervillains. Boooo. I know they are supposed to be harder but resist giving half damage (meaning 2 resist would resist 1 hit from a supervillain) would be nice when some builds are built on resist. I remember fighting a boss and I had 10 stacks of resist on hunter that did nothing to help.

- Some of the skins leave a lot to be desired. Deadpool's midnight suns armor is cool and distinctively different from reg deadpool and xforce deadpool. But Iron man has 3 of the same armor with some different colors and small stylizations. The midnight suns armor is not cooler than the knight armor and part of me feels like the 2 could have been swapped or something. Or give his some flames coming off him to match his legend ability. Iron man isn't the only 1 but the first to come to mind. Also more color combos or the ability to make our own combo after unlocking all the other variant colors. It is sad when you get to the point when you open a chest and don't get a new variant color. That is until you get a DLC character or get midnight sun armor for a character but with 30 keys and a literal ass ton of chests that doesn't last long.

PROs:
- Range of difficulties Diablo style and explains the changes and benefits. Challenging sometimes puzzle like gameplay that I enjoy especially from a turnbased game.

- Gameplay is very fun and I enjoy that not everything boils down to a gamble like in XCOM (I don't like XCOM). There are some ""up to chance"" mechanics but they always seem fair if not tilted in your favor a bit. Bosses/ supervillains are always a fun and unique encounter and them randomly appearing in general missions after is challenging surprise. 

- Marvel lore. There is so much of it here and such good attention to detail. Deadpool talking about Hydra Bob. Eddie talking about why Venom has tendrils that act like Spider-Mans webs. Magik and Wolverine talking about Colossus. The list goes on. These may seem like pretty small and inconsequential details but it means that they cared about the source material and that matters a lot to me. (*cough* Witcher and Halo tv shows). 

- Great story so far and amazing choice of characters and voice actors. All around great and I can't wait to see the end.

- Some really fun customization and I find myself switching things up ever so often just to go with a new look.

- The pool. IYKYK.

At present, with the current DLC included, I would say this game is about a 7.5/10. Worth it? Definitely. Still has some flaws. For sure but still an enjoyable game. I may come back to this in the future after I play the last of the DLC, beat the campaign, start NG+, and hopefully see some bug fixes in between,",1679866791,1679866791,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I didn't really know what to expect, but I thought ""it's a Marvel game so there's gotta be some cool elements to it"". I wasn't wrong.  This game has kept me captivated from the start. The gameplay and character development/ customizations are enjoyable, moreso than I thought they'd be. I enjoy the strategy involved in each battle and with several difficulty options to choose from, you'll likely find something that works for you too. There are many collectibles and side missions to keep you busy. The story line is typical of what you'd expect from a comic book series, but with way more emphasis on witchcraft, demonic possession and the occult (parents, it's a central theme of the game...you've been warned). An interesting, Sims-like focus is placed on developing friendships with your teammates. Fully upgrading a hero's abilities is dependent on the relationship the Hunter builds with them both in combat and around the Abbey. I will warn you, this game has crashed several times on my laptop, but not on my Steam Deck. I'm not sure why b/c the laptop meets all recommended specs and I use the same internet for both devices. The laptop loads via 2K while the Deck seems to load directly through steam. Maybe that's it?  Anyway, the point is the game is fun but over priced and the Season pass is DISGUSTINGLY overpriced. Definitely buy on steep discount. Overall I'm really enjoying the base game. User reviews and price have kept me away from the season pass for now. You can enjoy the game with or without the season pass, but you can't get all the achievements without it... weasel move, 2k.

I feel that they don't understand the characters they are interacting with? Maybe they are not comic fans. I loved bonding with all the heroes and Tony is annoying but that's normal. for himThe combat is frustrating at first due to having low skill cards. I think that's where a lot of people have complaints about the game but once you get your upgrades and grind (there is a lot of grinding but it's enjoyable grinding IMO) out your skills you will find yourself having a good time if turn-based strategy/card battles are your thing. They aren't really mine and I still find the game enjoyable. The game crashed 8 times in 2 days for me (causing me to find something else to do after 4 crashes each time) later on in the game it seems to be more stable (?) very odd. The resources you need to acquire to upgrade your cards will come VERY slowly. You can find pittances laid around the home base daily, other than that you have to do missions that reward those resources. The amount they reward is generally enough to upgrade a single ability card. (You have like 9 heroes with around 6 cards each, that's 54 abilities.) That means you need to do 54 of these missions in order to get everyone upgraded enough not to suck, but there's plenty of other things to spend your resources on as well so have fun with that.As I said in the beginning the developers made the idiotic choice to include anti-cheat software in the game's binaries. This means you cannot use most types of cheats/trainers. If you open CheatEngine the game will literally just close. However the developers don't seem to realize that ANYTHING is on the table when it comes to software and if you look hard enough you can find ways to cheat if you don't desire to engage the GRIND. I use a hacked version of CheatEngine that blocks the game's anti-cheat from detecting it. Case in point: Developers have been trying to stop pirated games for more than two decades and have been unable to do so. Why? Because ANYTHING is on the table when it comes to software. You think of a way to keep pirates from pirating, they think of a way around it. Welcome to earth, don't spend development money on shit that won't work. (I assume they had to pay for this anti-cheat service which means WE paid for it) As such I promised them in a crash report that I will not be buying their overpriced DLC that adds a character with dialog/skills.Save your money, but it on sale, expect crashes, spend hours grinding (or cheat like I did, now it's fun)",1679816080,1679816080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The player does need to like turn based fighting and having a deck of cards.   But it is more than that.  The story is incredible.  I am a person who never is interested in the story and just wants action.  I skip through dialogue and cut scenes but NOT in this game.   But you can if you want to.   I have never laughed so much in a game.  The writing and acting is unbelievable.  I feel as if I am there.   You walked down a hallway and its as if the other characters are alive just chatting among themselves.  You want to stop and listen because usually its funny.   Great graphics.   My only gripe is some of the muscles are out of proportion on the male bodies.   Doesn't look natural.

Only real positive I have to say is that the voice acting and sound quality seems really high so far.  But....

poor character models.  Really unimpressive for a 2022 release game.  Faces are not much better than what you could do in (Selecting random MMO) Star Trek Online.  Bodies are a bit better, but due to the game play...

What does it matter that the bodies are better definition than the faces?  You get to move them around a world and whenever it goes into a fight we get to play Magic the Gathering.  Yay!  Cards in a computer game.  Why come up with innovative game play when we can just use the way people played a card game 25 years ago?  I'm so glad that I get to hear Iron Man repeat the same line over and over as he uses his ""Blast"" card.  In 2022 we couldn't do better than this?

Story so far is very generic.  Build up of backstory is a bit abrupt at the beginning and very expositional, but ""randomly collected group of heroes gangs up to fight against randomly generated apparently infinitely powerful baddie"" is the way stories seem to be created nowadays.  I guess will see if it gets better.  My hopes aren't high.

The characters in the game are great as well, you get to build friendships with them, which is quite nice, but I would have liked a darker tone, more mature, but I guess this is for all ages, so it´s great.

Do not buy it if you hate the late Marvel with its cheesy jokes and overall silliness. Also do not buy if you’re looking for XCOM with superheroes – even though the gameplay loop is a bit similar, the Midnight Suns contains so many dialogues and side activities that they usually take more time than the combat. And the tactical combat itself has nothing in common with XCOM - if you need a comparison it’s more like a SteamWorld Quest with emphasis on arena positioning.
The game is not simple to love. The dialogues sometimes are pure cringe. There’s not a single drop of blood even from Wolverine's or Deadpool's cuts. The story sometimes tries to be serious, but then in a minute a villain start to throw phrases like “You came for your doom, heroes!” or “I eat heroes like you for breakfast!” and it all starting to feel like I'm watching a morning cartoon for kids.

The Midnight Suns are a team, and a very dysfunctional one. You talk to this people and you go on a journey of how they try to integrate. Everyone has opinions on what is happening. They develop or break relationships, argue over their beliefs. It's really cool.

The graphics are phoned in.  There is tearing, clipping, you can literally see Cpn' America's eyes rolling in his head in his future suit, you can see the seam between Venom's head and his body.

The performance is awful.  The main menu has an FPS of about 2 for some reason, and easily half the time the game crashes at launch and eventually restarting it will make it go again.  At odd times, for no reason, the pathing freaks out and your character runs INTO the explosions before setting them off, effectively killing himself.

There is no ""toggle to run"" key and no way to toggle it, so just go ahead and cut off your pinky now, it's less painful that way.

The controls are janky.  Your character will randomly start bolting if he walks outside but if you accidentally hit ""sprint"" then you have to hold it to keep him sprinting, despite the fact that he was just sprinting on his own before.  The game is supposed to tell you where your character will end up after you play a card but that doesn't always happen.  Sometimes the pathing lags out and the characters will jump, snake, slide and do weird s-curves to get to where they are going and end up in really weird places, like standing directly next to an explosion to set off an explosion.

Most of the characters feel pretty weak in comparison to the completely standard humans you end up fighting.

In New Game +, in all the choreographed combat cut scenes, The Hulk is dodging cars and crap as Bruce Banner for some reason.  Also, there is nothing stopping you from taking Venom to go defeat Venom in New Game +.

New Game + doesn't add much.

How are you going to add a vampire DLC with no teeth?  I mean like, literally, in all the abby cut scenes dude has no teeth and all you can see is his tongue flapping around.

Which is a shame because it could be a really fun CCG and they did an awesome job creating a ""fully customizable avatar"" for the player to identify with, and the usual Firaxis save-scumming isn't really a thing.  There is just a log of bugs and graphical issues that will need to get worked out, and based on my history with Firaxis, probably won't and will likely get worse with age.

If they were to fix the graphics, improve performance, eliminate most of the abby resource collection stuff and add in some kind of randomization to the base, like, I don't know...the Avenger from Xcom2, and lean a bit harder into the CCG aspects of the game, it would be a pretty solid contender for a GOTY edition.",1676943494,1679456529,False,0,0,0.492058008909225464,0,True,False,False

PROS:
- Love the deck building of characters and the strategic ""X-Com lite"" battle sequences. 
- While the storyline/third-person graphics (when hanging around the Abbey and grounds) are ok even at high optimized levels, the battles are fantastic.
- Speaking of the battles, everything from the sound design to the cinematic cameras as numerous powers ""activate"" are superb. Hearing Captain America's shield ""thump"" into enemies and the crack of Hydra heads as they get smacked around (as well as the heroes) is downright awesome and I love it. The sound design gives the battle sequences some real ""weight"" and are a definite highlight.
- Classic heroes and villains abound and the voice acting for pretty much all of them evoke the characters we remember from the movies. Tony's one-liners, Cap's stoic reserve, Spider Man's erratic wit, etc... I think a few voices are weaker than others and to be completely honest, your character, The Hunter (at least the male version) is the weakest link of them all. The delivered lines are stiff and awkward. I haven't played the female Hunter yet, but the male one is a bit bland even if he's one of the most powerful characters in play.

CONS:
- I only have a few gripes. One being the performance of the game can be lacking. Stuttering/FPS drop is common around the abbey and surrounding grounds. Graphic glitches can make things funny or frustrating depending on the situation.
- There's a lot to do. And while in some games base building and immersion can add real value, I think Midnight Suns tries to do way too much. Building friendships with the other heroes, forge upgrades etc., sending other heroes out on ops (much like X-Com's operative missions) which doesn't seem to progress the story at all like X-Com actually does, completionist collecting of tarot cards, journals, etc., to one of the worst time wasters of gathering ingredients to make whatever, it's all just really a LOT. And I know I missed quite a few things when it comes to these time wasters (like finding little globe drops around the abbey that give you a pittance of a prize). To me at least, the fat could have been trimmed dramatically. Especially since a lot of people (me included) bought the game for the chance to fight and battle super villains only to be relegated to one battle per day and the rest you spend talking to random heroes, gathering herbs and flowers, upgrading something or other that isn't exactly well-documented, etc. 

In the end I AM having a blast with the game despite my CONS list. The combat is very cool and figuring out strategies with different heroes and builds is very fulfilling. Based on that alone I'd recommend purchasing Midnight Suns.",1679442166,1679442166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I understand what was just typed sounds completely horrible, but it's all negligible compared to the fun i'm having laughing at the good dialogue parts and the amazing character chemistry and how well the gameplay feels to get something right and get different fun cards and passives from all the character building and all of the base building. No the crap thing that's negative is I played the first act for like fifty hours. I thought to myself wow I must be lucky, I avoided the crashes everyone else was talking about. Wrong. It totally started happening way too often since I got to act 2. It crashed 3 times in like 5 hours after I have been playing for 50. Once was in the middle of a boss battle.

Edit: Apparently what seems to work is leaving it on full screen and turning DLSS on. Which is wild to have to do without ray tracing on and with a 30 series card. SO if you're experiencing crashes and you don't have full screen mode on or DLSS at least on quality mode that may be your problem. Also, I just saw a new bug where Venom's tongue is just a spear coming out of his mouth in the training grounds. So if you have him go take a look at it. It's quite humorous. They need to fix a few things with Venom. He was honestly one of the three reasons I wanted the DLC. Deadpool works great without too much weirdness, looking forward to Morbius, and even though I know not too much about storm since I never read her comics. I'm looking forward to seeing how she works. I really can't see Morbius being too different from Blade and Storm being too different from Nico.",1678016093,1679424757,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I kept wanting to play ""just one more mission"" and before I knew it 10 hours had passed.

Replacing the RNG of percentage hits from Xcom with cards that represent abilities is a very nice change to the genre if you ask me, as well as adding some fun ways to change up your playstyle.

Now for the ugly side of the game, the performance is atrocious, there's a guide online on how to disable the 2K launcher, which makes it a little better, but it eventually turns into a slideshow and starts chugging, requirering a game restart to fix it, and I found that the further into the game I got, the more often this would happen. Particularly during the final mission I found myself restarting the game twice just to maintain playable framerates (yes I'm aware of how silly this sounds in a turn based game, but it was that bad).
I ended up keeping my performance tab open on a second monitor after the first restart during the final mission, and I found that my GPU usage never went above 10%, so to me that just screams poor optimization.
This didn't ruin the experience for me, but it might be a deal breaker for you, I personally loved every minute with the game, even running around The Abbey (which is the home base where all the non-combat content happens), where there's a lot of optional story to explore as well as ""treasure chests"" that contains cosmetic unlocks and consumables.

I bought this game during the Steam Winter sale at the 30% discount for around 40 euros, which I found to be a fitting price, it was a bit too pricy for me at the 60 euros asking price on release, but I'm guessing that was the marvel tax.

A minor gripe for me is that the casual clothes you can chose to use when you do stuff in The Abbey all looks like it was designed for the male character model, and then just reshaped, with no thought given to making feminine looking clothes for those who play with a female Hunter.

Edit:

With the arrival of the Deadpool DLC I tried to complete it twice to get the achievements, they were still broken the last time I tried it, and have decided to hold off on playing the game any further until all the DLC is out and the achievements are fixed, the utter lack of communication from the devs on fixing the issues with the game is discouraging to say the least, so if you are considering buying it, I would hold off until they're fixed.",1673873985,1679384489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That's what I thought when buying this (at a discount that is). And boy have I been surprised. Is this XCOM? No. Not at all. Does it have some XCOM formula in it? Well...yes...kinda. It feels a lot like XCOM 2, with your squad of heroes that could very well just be a bunch of rebell fighters, going against a bigger force. But everything else? Nah. Gameplay wise it's different.

Why compare it to XCOM at all? Well obviously it's the same studio that made those games. And it's pretty much the same genre. Also the same producer. So one would expect at least SOME elements of that series. And they are there. BUT they are different in a way. 

You build a card deck for each and every hero and then you go into it, fighting it out. No big map, searching for enemies, just encounters. It feels quicker and actually it's a good thing. Would it work in a XCOM game? Unlikely. But this isn't a XCOM game. Could be a lot like that spin off they did a couple of years ago...don't remember it's name, but it's even more simplified. However it kinda works. As long as you let it. It's a narrative driven, role playing, tactical card game and as it turns out it's really kinda good. The story is nice, the characters are voiced and good in that manner and the story is good enough to keep you hooked for a while. 

However it lacks in the grind department. You REALLY have to do a LOT of missions to get everything you actually want and the progress is SLOW. Like really slow. But once you got an idea about where to get your ressources from, you can at least get a decent amount of ressources to build up for the storyline. There is more to explore however, with sidequests and building up your very own base (XCOM again) and it's nice to walk around as a character in the gameworld. 

What really brings this one down is the monetization, their way of charging you real money to reduce the grind for cosmetics and other stuff. That's not really okay and I don't think that the game deserves that since it could be good in it's own way. Also it has no workshop. Yeah I know, copyrights and stuff, but XCOM was kept alive for years on end due to it's modding cummunity. 

So, is it any good? Yeah. Yeah even if you despise Marvel and/or Disney it's good. The gameplay is really nice, the story is better than everything Disney+ has put up the last three years and as long as you don't mind some grind, you'll have a good time with this. 

I really hope they'll use some of the elements in a XCOM 3, since walking around as the commander and talkting to my crew really was something I enjoyed. Still...buy it at a discount. No really. It's far too expensive at it's normal price.",1679356506,1679356686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This game done a pretty decent job on turn based combat playing. If you are a Marvel fan and enjoy this kind of genre or having familiar with turn based genres, you will probably like this game too. Game makes you plan your every move in the most efficient way in order to beat the encounter. Of course there is also the luck side of the situation as your actions mostly determined by the cards in your hand drawn from your heroes deck, but if you keep your decks well organized and play with the heroes which work better together, you won't fail due to bad luck. And here comes the big [b]BUT[/b]:

▼ Outside of the turn based combat, you hang in an area called the Abbey where you can upgrade your current cards, edit hero decks, and craft items that you can use in combats. Crafting items are really pain in the a♥♥ because you need to collect the crafting materials by running like mad from here and there. This is really awful because

▼ You can only move your character in the four directions while you are inside of the Abbey. This means no jumping etc. Only W-A-S-D. And there are too many minor obstacles that your character can stuck like rocks, trees

▼ No mini map inside of the Abbey. You need to memorize the roads or open the map. But you lose control of your character when you switch to the map screen. You can fast travel to checkpoints though

▼ Mechanics are OK but there are too many details. Once you learn all of them you can handle them pretty enough, but this force the tutorial part to last very long and this could make you lose your focus at the very start of the things

▼ All these things I mentioned above kills the fun and breaks the speed of the game very dramatically. After a good one or two combats, you are going to find yourself running from one end to another inside of a creepy area to collect some mushrooms and other stuff

You can forgo collecting things ofcourse, but then you cannot craft anymore items and items are really useful especially if you are playing in more challanging difficulties. Apart from these, game will crush suddenly, story line is meh, overall graphic quality is suprisingly poor (not talking about fancy effects).

I have mentioned the good things at the start. So, in conclusion, don't buy this game until its in a sale. And, don't jump start with the DLCs. This game has a replayability potential, but the cons I mentioned kills this potential IMO. And, your team is already big enough, new characters unlocked with DLCs won't be needed most of the time.",1678101250,1679331880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a great gameplay loop, and the characterisations and interactions with the heroes are great, with a nice range of heroes in all senses of the word. I would like to see more interaction between the heroes thou, as there's only really the club interactions outside of Stark and Strange's banter at the forge (which is among the best bits in the game), although I do understand that that was probably a production limitation since making dedicated interaction stories between each hero would have been much more work.
It does suffer from some lack in diversity for the missions, with the fact that every mission takes place in pretty much the same arena with no interior walls that only change aesthetically, and there are only ever 4 objectives (defeat all enemies, protect device, destroy device, or secure object) probably being the major reason for that. The fact that the final fight is just 4 waves of juiced up normal enemies (with so many ""evil effects"" on them you might have to turn down your graphic settings to keep things running at a decent rate) was pretty disappointing. It could have been so much better, especially since you were going in with all the heroes.
Speaking of, if there was one major change I would make to the game (besides an actual final boss), it would be being able to do multiple missions in the same day with different heroes. Like there's already a few story missions where you have different teams for different parts of it, so I would have liked it if you could send out like 2 squads at the start (since you start with 8 heroes you should be able to do 2 squads of 3). It would help with the resource balance, the level up problem with some heroes just getting so left behind they had to implement an auto-level system, as well as just having to do the basics (gamma coils, daily training, etc) so often. I'm hoping they're making a sequel that addresses this issues, or that they open it up to mods that can add that kind of stuff.
Since my complaints basically boil down to ""I wish there was more of it"", I do recommend it to anyone who is interested.",1679265372,1679265372,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Gameplay is top tier from the creators of x-com. The card system works really well and the heroes feel and play different as they should. Hulk smashes and bashes, spider man is fast and agile, Dr strange feels like the sorcerer supreme he is. 

Story is good, like watching a new marvel animated series you can be a part of. No stupid marvel comedy club like Love and Thunder, but good ol' hero one liners. 

Hero customisation and deck building are vast and plentiful. You don't feel like you need to buy the extra ski s really.

Cons:
The game is optimiser really badly. With recommended setup, game stutters alot right after loading or when there's a huge bunch of enemies on the board. Almost made me quit the last mission out of frustration. Maybe after several performance patched they can fix it. 

DLC is not worth it. Venom and Deadpool are cool as hell, but only three Missions is not worth the price. 

As a principle, Microtransaction skins suck. 

It's a great game overall and had me entertained through the campaign, but I don't feel like it's worth the box price. Get it on discount, maybe 50% off so you don't feel ripped. 
Also I recommend waiting for all DLC to come out as a package and discounted. 

6/10 good marvel smashing, bad publisher decisions and sub par performance.

This game was a blast in the first half of the game. I really enjoyed the tactics and card parts of the game; but, it became really hard to care about the game in the second half after all the game halting dialogue just kept getting thrown at me. Unfortunately even the card part got stale as I settled on optimal builds and didn't really care about what I was getting anymore. The constant dialogue I suppose is comic-like, but it really slowed the entire pace of the game down in my opinion.

On top of this the game had bizarre graphical glitches. Occasionally the world would turn into some kind of Jackson Pollock painting of kaleidoscope colors and would require be to fully reboot. It slowed down for seemingly no reason especially on the final mission.

Don't even get me started on the real money for outfits on your over talkative teammates and season pass in a single player game. Cash grab for sure. Probably to pay back on the licensing for all this.

With lack of stages and a limited variety of effective moves, combat does become monotonous. I recommend sticking to task and progressing through the story quickly before you hit the wall in the back half of the game. Although, working quickly is going to be difficult as fellow heroes are going to stop you and ask you to be nice to them. Most of this game, believe it or not, is a friends-making simulator where you are heavily encouraged to buy gifts for your fellow hero friends as well as take time to compliment them and have hang out sessions with them, if you want to fill their friend meter and unlock their ""legendary"" suit and special ability to which I say- don't be friends with people because it'll give you stuff but in the context of this particular game- not worth siting through hours of mind numbing dialogue. Dialogue will account for a large chunk of this game's playthrough time which is to say literally most of it, which is a problem for those who don't care about hearing about how much a super hero likes or hates being a super hero. Spoilers: they didn't ask for this life. For all you interior decorators out there, Midnight Suns also invites you to decorate your room and buy clothes fit for the cast of jersey shore. There's no way you won't look like everyone you try to avoid with this unfortunate clothing selection. Do you like chores? Midnight Suns has you covered there too. As if the dialogue wasn't sucking enough time away from the real reason you bought the game- the combat- characters will ask you to collect plants in order to cook potions you won't need if playing on medium difficulty or to perform rituals for side quest rewards. Unfortunately, even the voice acting is... off. So I dunno. I want to like it, I love the XCOMs, but this is far from an XCOM. Out of extreme boredom, I've tried to go back and play it because I wanted to see how efficient I could be with my team build, but of the extra hour and a half I spent, only about 30 minutes of that was spent in combat and the rest was me trying to skip the flood of terribly boring dialogue.

In Marvel's Midnight Suns you fend off the impending apocalypse du jour with a rookie team called The Midnight Suns and almost all of the Avengers. They set up camp in a monastery in a parallel dimension. You, the player, take the part of The Hunter, a man/woman (your choice) who is resurrected to fight against the herald of the current end of the world. Again, by the way. This is complicated by the fact that the herald is also the mother of The Hunter. So, the game can be split in three parts: 1) relationship drama, 2) exploration, and 3) fighting. 

1) Relationship Drama
A horde of mopey youngsters living through teenage angst and the comically one-dimensional Avengers come together in a former monastery sitting inside a bubble in ""Limbo"" -- the front yard to Catholic hell -- to fight of Chthon, an elder god who just took the name of the greek underworld but has no relation otherwise. Naturally nobody in this troupe has the good sense to be just open in dealing with each other, so much drama ensues. It falls to you, The Hunter, to talk the others through some inner conflicts and become besties. It is amazing how flat and lacking in variety the characters are (most of them are anti-social loners, I suppose the writers thought that's how ""tough"" people are.) Despite their infuriating douchebaggery the characters are mostly well-done and the voice-acting is very good. The graphics are servicable, not great but also not terrible. The mechanics are simple and straightforward, talk , have an activity together, make a gift or compliment, coaching in existential questions. The results have minor impact on part 3) in form of small boni.

2) Exploration
The monastery grounds are not large, but especially in the beginning you spend a good portion of time exploring them. During the expeditions you have to solve a few really easy riddles and collect items, some of them of high story-telling relevance, some just for using them in workshops. The story items are unfortunatly very blunt, so that the ""shocking twists"" are not so shocking and twisty when they come to pass. Furthermore you have a few workshops on the grounds where you can build useful items, brew potions, train your characters and so on. Lots of this stuff have impact on 3) in adding capabilities or giving large boni.

3) Fighting
This is a turn-based card game. Per turn you have a number of ""card plays"" and a few other moves. Your turn ends and the computer takes its turn. The moves are varied and allow for a good depth of tactics. Maybe you have read that this is XCOM-like, so be warned, it is not! It is not a tactics game, unless you mean card playing tactics. You have virtually no control over position of heroes and it does, with the exception of the Scarlett Witch, really not matter all that much. Important is your hero points and card play management. While 1) and 2) are presented in third person perspective, the fight game is 3D isometric, broken up with small cut scenes when your heroes do something special. 

In Summary
Midnight Suns is a fun game. While it starts to drag on after a while, it never got a chore. It often annoys you with teenage angst drama or other shockingly stupid behaviour, but that's just Marvel story telling in any medium. It manages to build up an immersive atmosphere and good mood. Unfortunatly the story itself becomes very predicable quickly and a few inconsistencies and continuity errors crept in (eg. the conversations with Sara about  the collar). The moral choices you have to make during the game don't matter a bit in the end, which is railroady anyway. Recommended if you like easy card games and a good yarn.

I had to refund it on Steam because the environmental strategy aspect was reduced to using the same 3-4 props over and over in the arena. There are no baiting or flanking tactics because movement distance is free and there are no cover or backstab mechanics. As a result, player positioning is only useful for setting up a single AOE attack per turn. The new quest locations lack charm and consist of tiny arenas.

Furthermore, the huge base, customizations, and friendship quests were completely unnecessary.

Additionally, the game constantly pressures players to spend real money on digital house and clothing upgrades.

Marvel's Midnight Suns is an absolute gem of a game.

There's a good sense of difficulty for the most part and the gameplay loop is really quite addicting.

It did take me a while to get into it- at first it felt much too easy and I was annoyed with the not-tactical aspects of the game.

By the end of my first play-through it was just-right on challenge level.

The fact that it was a RTS is just a minor detail as you could pause it and plan your actions.

Quite frankly I feel this game fails at everything it is setting out to do. Ten hours into the game I don’t understand who the main enemy is or what she is trying to do. The game would rather get bogged down in boring fetch quests and long boring conversations about organising birthday parties or doing boring activities like bird watching or painting. The heroes never seem to have anything interesting to say or do and the conversations drag on forever. Yes I could ignore doing these activities, but that would come at the expense of leveling up characters and (supposedly) unlocking cool new abilities. Yes I could simply skip past all the dialogue, but that just shows that this aspect of the game has not been designed or written well.

When it comes to the combat, it’s pretty good. Unfortunately, combat missions are over too quickly and are few and far between. You have multiple heroes available in your team but only two can be chosen alongside the main character for any given mission. It’s hard to actually feel any attachment or sense of progression when you get to use the heroes so infrequently. In ten hours of play I’ve only progressed six game days, so I’ve essentially only played six combat missions with a couple of extra tutorial ones at the start. Each combat mission only takes about 15 minutes so this just goes to show how much bloat is built into your time spent back at the base.

I know this game is not supposed to be Xcom and it would be unfair to compare this game to that, however one thing Xcom got right but this game gets wrong is the balance between time spent on base and time spent on mission. The balance is completely off in this game.

The game is billed as a collectable card game of sorts, in fact I have seen positive reviews compare this game to Slay the Spire. Nothing could be further from the truth. In Slay the Spire you get to choose a new card after every combat, and there are many of them to collect. Here it takes a long time to get any new cards for your heroes, and as far as I’m aware there are only about 10 different cards per hero. Can you imagine if Slay the Spire only had 10 different cards per hero!? The one positive thing about this game is that the different cards you collect have unique animations and some of them are quite spectacular. This just makes me lament even more that I get so few opportunities to actually play that side of the game. Oh look, Nico is crying again! I better go and spend an hour cheering her up rather than trying to save the world!

I have reached a point in this game where the thought of going back into it exhausts me quite frankly. The amount of busy work required to get to the next actual combat mission in the game is genuinely scary.

It has an insane amount of untapped potential with the mechanics, talented voice actors, and everything else, but is held back by lack of content (even when side-questing as much as possible). This wouldn't be an issue if the downloadable content was substantial after everything is said in done in the first and possibly only season pass. 

This feels like a game that spent most of its budget on licenses (i.e. Marvel) and had to cut corners to meet deadlines. Multiple characters have the same model, the soundtrack is not that varied, there aren't that many enemy types/bosses, and the replay offers little incentive due to lack of difficulty. I know there was a bit of controversy regarding the card system at first when the game got announced, but I genuinely love it. When it comes down to it however, I am sure all players choose a very similar build for the characters due to some cards being clearly better than others, regardless of modifications.

I could go on for a while but the short and simple of it is that it is a good game that is in desperate need of a sequel with more time in the oven to be polished. I would not recommend this game at full price and instead only buy it during a decent sale unless you're a huge Marvel fan.

Almost every character written really well and I did not expect that from this game - even though the overall story is nothing special, but the dialogues between character are written really well.

No spoilers and i've played the entire game at this point...

The battles (missions) in Midnight Suns are very cool and a lot of fun. The card-play mechanic works surprisingly well, the action is fast-paced, and you truly feel like Cyclops commanding a load of superheroes in the field. You face some cool villains and each hero is completely unique in combat with thematic abilities, so having to decide which individuals to take on which missions makes for a nice challenge. Making a comic book cover for each mission is a fun touch, akin to how easily you can get lost in Gwent in Witcher III and wake up Sunday wondering where your weekend went.

However, the non-battle stuff that takes up 2/3 of the game is dull, and does not impact the game at all. It's more 1st person than X-Com, and all you do is talk to other Superheroes and do childish stuff like planning surprise parties and mediating secret crushes. If you're picturing a school playground right now, that's spot on. That's exactly what it's like. This friendship-driven element has nice morals, but makes for dull game play.

There is no real base-building that affects the game play. You can buy aesthetic things and discover new areas, but it has absolutely no impact on the game. It's also very unclear you can do this, and i didn't realise until the end of the game! So there's some proof pudding that it's all pointless. There's also a hell of a lot of resources, but you forget about them very quickly. There's no Age of Empires-style mechanic for acquiring them and having to think carefully about where you spend them: you just find them or you don't. And, as mentioned, the things they buy influence the game so little you stop caring.

A slight annoyance is how all the heroes level up automatically very fast. You can work so hard to get one hero up a couple of levels, but when you hit a milestone, they all bump up to that level anyway. This is very unsatisfying and makes you forget that levels are even a thing.

What I like:

- Card deck developing combos and strategies.
- Decently written scripts with the ability to bypass dialogue.
- Variety of heroes and when some new heroes are added.

What I dislike
- Combat gets repetitive.
- The pre and post sleep cut scenes.
- Running around to the same four rooms everyday.

- Not being able to access the game after an update for 3+ days.

It's a surprisingly effective and interesting way of doing it, and one that allows for some nice variety in mission types and mechanics.

You have a bunch of relationship and event mechanics, item gathering, exploration, and crafting.  It is a little overstuffed to be frank, I probably could have done with one or two less mechanics.

-Padding. Lots and lots of padding. There is three (3!) skippable animations each time you sleep. Why sleep? It's a chore you have to do after each and every mission. No, you cannot initiate it from anywhere, you have to go to a specific location. There is 3 different menus you must access to modify your deck. 2 of those can only be accessed from a particular location. 
- The tactical camera seem to have been designed to hinder the players. IT's a chore to try to see the whole battlefield. A simple zoom out option would have prevented that, but they went with a ""tactical view"" that is zoom out as little as possible. This is a playstation 1 era camera. 
- The grind is relentless. You have to grind about 10 different kind of money, and any action you make cost money. A lot of these money types must be obtained by moving around the base area, making the rounds each night to gather stuff from random locations. Fun! 
-Repetitive missions. You basicaly do the same 4-5 missions over and over again. There is absolutely no ennemy variety aside from the bosses. 
-Artificial dfficulty. A lot of missions involve saving crates from exploding. Prepare to save scum a lot, since random events and random card draws will determine if you can complete the mission, not player skills. 
-Dialog is a roller-coaster. When it's good, it's great, but it is usualy tacked on without an after thought. 
-Lots of status without any explanation. 
-The game believes that everybody has an azerty keyboard. It allows us to change the movement keys, but, in keeping with the chores-as-gameplay mentality of this game, you need to change them each time you play. 

Pros: 
-Style variety. Each character got his schtick, and they are pretty differents. 
-Friendship building instead of romantic building is a nice change of pace. 
- Pretty much bug-free. 
-Some rarely used characters. 

All in all, this could have been a great mobile game, but it became a crappy pc game.

PROs: 
- Fantastic TTB combat, I would describe it as an eclectic mix between Xcom, Into the Breach, and Slay the Spire.
Draft cards and build a deck for wide cast of super-hero favorites, complete missions using tactics and strategy, and use the environment to manipulate enemy positions to line them up and knock them into each other.

CONs:
- Probably some of the worst writing I've ever seen in a video game in my life.  The plot is serviceable but paper-thin in lots of spots.  The dialogue is atrocious; there are conversations where characters deliver lines back and forth to each other that don't feel like human conversation.  Some of the characters have... dubious motives and actions that doesn't feel like something the character would do or say (Example as a very minor spoiler: [spoiler] Blade starts a book club because he has a crush on Captain Marvel [/spoiler] .  There are lots of scenarios and conversations that feel straight from a cringey slice-of-life high school anime, except with adult super heroes.  And there is A LOT of dialogue, I mean on the level of something like Fire Emblem: Three Houses.

- Speaking of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, this game includes an overworld/hub where you have to explore and find crafting materials.  It's tedious and awful, and while you could probably ignore them, they allow you to craft powerful consumable cards that can make-or-break certain missions.

TLDR; the gameplay is amazing, that plot is serviceable, and the writing for the dialogue ranges from cringe to outright incomprehensible.  6-7/10, play it if you like Xcom and Marvel but don't expect too much from the dialogue and story.",1678884552,1678884552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The PS5 port does crash occasionally, and has graphical lag, worse graphics, and is generally slower. (Not bragging, I use a sub-$1k laptop, i7-10750H+GTX1660Ti+32GBDDR5+2.5TBSSD.) The Steam port has its share of problems too: 1) The 2k launcher is terrible, slowing down the game significantly; you'll want to look up how to launch the game directly, skipping the 2k launcher. 2) It will crash if you try to alt-tab on a loading screen. In fact it crashed so hard on me I had to reinstall my drivers, old school: uninstall, boot in safe mode with basic drivers, the whole thing. 3) There are some graphical artifacts. These are technical problems. The game has been out nearly 5 months as of this review. Not great for a game launch, not terrible either.

The game itself is a lot of fun! Looks great - so great there's a photo mode. The core game mechanic is a deceptively simple, yet deep strategy game. The core game loop is nice: Kick butt with Marvel heroes, go home and hang out with them, explore a haunted forest, solve its mysteries, give yourself to the dark side, repeat. Blade is as cool as he was in the 90's. Wolverine calls you bub. Magik and I have too much in common. Dr. Strange is better characterized than he is in the MCU - most of the MCU characters are. There's some surprisingly touching dialogue in this game. Even my boyfriend who doesn't like the MCU likes hanging out with the boys and the witches after-hours in the Abbey.

I admit when I first heard of the concept I thought it was not for me. ""A card game with billiards? And in between card games you play The Sims with MCU characters?"" Roommate got it on his PS5. Watched him play. I figured I'd have a go. And yeah it's a lot of fun. First playthrough was dark side, second was light side, third was the Deadpool DLC, fourth is the Venom DLC. Figure I'll get a few more playthroughs in with the Morbius and Storm DLC. That's something like 240-300 hours of play all told.

1) DRM: Fucking why ? It’s a single player game why does it need fucking DRM. The game runs fine during battles. But once you’re in the abbey, the frame rate drops and the game stutters like a mfer. I have tested that if I bypass the 2k launcher(look up YouTube tutorial I highly recommended), the game runs perfectly. Oh and speaking of launcher….

2) 2K launcher: I honestly didn’t know there was such thing as a 2k launcher until I bought this game recently. As if EA origin, Ubisoft connect, rockstar game launcher were not proof enough these things suck for people who buy the game LEGITIMATELY and bog down the experience. 

3) Anti cheat: Yes you read that right. ANTI CHEAT in a single player game. Why is that important you may ask. When the game got an update sometime ago my saves mysteriously all got deleted post update and I had to redo from scratch. And I need to STRESS that this game is fairly Grindy. There’s multiple types of resources in this game, which is fine. But this entire game sets its up like a freemium game with the multiple resources and the excessive grinding you need to do. The worst part about it is the anti cheat system was NOT part of the game early in the launch. It was added in much later for some reason, most likely to offer micro transactions for resources in future. Again. In a SINGLE PLAYER GAME. 

Conclusion: The gameplay is fun, has its flaws here and there like the abbey being a laggy bitch but I can look past it. I can look past the season pass, even the shitty skins they want to sell to you. But the above reasons I stated is totally NOT worth supporting 2K at all as they DO not care for consumers who buy it legitimately.

Full points for a fun story and even more fun gameplay loops.

(Stand on soap box):  Just make a good COMPLETE game, and put an appropriate price on it from the start!

The main story is told through missions (and cutscenes. A lot of them) that you recieve at a table within your 'homebase' - the only area you can explore. There are also side missions, which will consist of kill/protect/fetch quests that will assist you with levelling and provide you with fairly mediocre rewards you could most likely do without. 

There is a friendship mechanic that allows you to, obviously, befriend the heroes you team up with, which will sometimes provide you with temporary bonuses in battle and ample opportunity to facepalm every time you have to listen to the subpar voice acting.

There is also a crafting mechanic, that is extremely basic and provides you with what is basically potions, but in card form. They are also mostly unnecessary, unless you dislike the combat (which is roughly 90% of the game, so you're screwed if that's the case) and simply want it to be over with as soon as possible.

The characters range between people who take themselves too seriously and what I think are young adults who act like whiny children often enough that I can understand why villains exist.

The nicest thing I can honestly say about this game beyond the story being interesting enough that I am not yet bored, is that you're not forced to be nice just because you're supposedly 'good' ... how a demon, half or otherwise, can be considered good outside of being brainwashed is beyond me.

However, I was a bit ambivalent as to how it will capture the superhero side of things and also with the card-based system. 

I skipped all reviews and walkthroughs as I wanted to play the game myself, having pre-ordered the Legendary edition. I finally started playing it recently (working through the backlog of games) and am really enjoying it. I do feel it lives up to the hype and brand. Think of it as having XCom-esque gameplay but with random cards as skills + Troubleshooter story and party banter + all the fun and excess with Marvel/X-Men superheroes. 

It does have its quirky bits such as transition/loading screens not maintaining a set resolution and the occasional glitch when moving around the homebase, but nothing extreme or game-breaking. For someone like me who watched most of the Marvel and X-Men movies but not the comics, it is also nice to chat with the heroes and learn more about their personalities and backgrounds. That was something missing in XCom but what I really enjoyed in Troubleshooter. 

There are reviews and comments that try to claim the game is ""woke trash"". I'm over 40 hours in and past the first Act and I've not seen anything obvious or sigh-worthy. If you go into the modding community, I think the biggest gripe they have is female superheroes are not half-naked or wearing skimpy costumes. To be honest, this game is no more 'political' than the Mass Effect trilogy, Final Fantasy series or Nier Automata - which is to say, there's nothing there unless you make it a point of believing there is. 

I see many more hours of playing Midnight Suns, and I am looking forward to the DLCs (yes we get Storm!). Hopefully they add many more expansions.

The combat is a simpler version of other games in the genre that is about maximizing damage output instead of positioning (though that can still be surprisingly important in certain encounters). The deck building adds the necessary amount of complexity and randomness to the much simpler setup than your traditional turn based strategy game. The combat in action is super well animated and entertaining to plan and watch the execution of. Things escalate nicely from a super simple and mundane start (to learn the mechanics) to crazy amounts of permutations and turn possibilities as you unlock and upgrade cards. It gets especially good as more and more optional objectives and things that you benefit from that cost your in turn resources pop up. All in all, stellar combat system.

Shockingly, that is not where you spend the bulk of your time. this game is a downtime simulator as much as it is is a turn based rpg game. It's here that the game both has surprising quality that I didn't expect as well as some pitfalls (mostly in the form of overtly corny dialogue). I really like how all the systems in the hub compound and interconnect (and almost all benefit you in the long run of adding abilities and options for you in your next combat encounter). It makes every decision (and there are so many) feel like it is making an impact on your next fight. Also good is the mystery component of exploring the grounds. It's simple almost adventure style gameplay but the story you unearth is rewarding and entertaining, the environments are progressively more intriguing, and it makes you feel smart solving it (though it's mostly clever game design than actual intelligence on the players part :D ). The dialogue ranges from touching, to funny, to soul crushingly corny (but you get used to it as the whole game kinda pulls itself together in tone over time). I think the soul crushingly corny dialogue is my only major complaint in the game and it really fades away as you get used to the overall presentation.

For minor complaints: The mouse cursor can be hidden but it reshows itself at the start of every encounter on my windows 11 machine and I have to keep moving it as a controller player. I don't know how far I am in the game but I've put some serious time in, and I wish The Midnight Suns characters were more prominent. It feels a little too Avengers heavy overall especially given the title and themes. I am happy Avengers are here, but a little less focus would have been nice. I'm not sure I agree with including Captain Marvel specifically as she doesn't feel necessary to the story and has no tie to the villains that I know of so could have tilted the balance back the right way (though I do like her gameplay). I think Dr Strange is the perfect Avenger to include and I think Tony has so much natural chemistry (and popularity) that that seems like an obvious choice as well. Captain America I'm mixed on but the themes of leadership and the Hydra focus help justify him. Deadpool is way too weak  but luckily on PC mods can help. I recommend the En Fuego balance mod on Nexus as it buffs him but doesn't overpower him. Lastly, I feel like the style of game should have been able to optimize it's load times on an SSD to have 0 loads and be entirely seamless, but the loading screens are short and not too big of a deal.

This game definitely has good components and all together with how every system and decision feeds into the next... it turns out to be greater than the sum of it's parts. I'm a huge fan and despite not being interested for the longest time, I'm happy I finally caved and would recommend it to almost anyone.",1678774715,1678774715,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It works best if you liked games like Three Houses or Persona 5 where half the game is the combat and half is the social simulator aspect, but the Abbey is still largely skippable if it doesn't interest you as much.

Combat revolves around attacks, support, and heroic cards.  Attack and support cards build heroism while heroic cards or environmental attacks spend it, so balancing what you've got available keeps you in a good place.  The game won't allow you to make decks that are _too_ unbalanced, so you're encouraged to experiment.  Heroic cards are basically just 'better' attack or support cards, and both types of cards have a lot of different things they can do even if attack cards largely deal damage and support cards largely don't.

Each hero has a distinct flavor and personality and basically all of them are interesting, there's a lot of options with deckbuilding but also the decks are small at 8 cards per hero so it's not going to overwhelm anyone who doesn't like decks, and the storyline is interesting.  The writing style is very comic-book, many quips at the start although it gets more and more serious as things go more and more south in the world.  If the jokey nature of the beginning missions is offputting to you it doesn't stay like that.  However, I personally felt that everything exuded the comic book feel I was expecting and all the voice actors do a great job in their roles.

Combat is largely flexible to be as hard as you want it to be, the harder you make things the more you're going to have to synergize and build decks that work with each other since your heroes will go down in 4-5 hits.  I found Heroic 1 a nice balance of fun without things being trivial, but you could push it to Heroic 2 or 3 probably if you're looking for a decent 'hard' mode.  While there are some potential quibbles about not having enough plays to set up good combos except if you get lucky, the nature of the game forces you to switch up your team constantly which gives things a lot of variety.

With the DLCs purchased, I enjoyed their missions but it did remove some desire to try to 100% all the friendship stuff since there's more heroes to deal with.   Thankfully, all that stuff is optional.  The game dragged perhaps a few hours longer than its content could manage, but not so much that it felt dreary.

If you are just here for the turn based combat - if you are the person that find the management in X-COM tedious at best and a distraction from the actual game? Stay far away from this. This game has a very relaxed, methodical pace. For every completed mission, you are likely to spend nearly as much time in your 'home base' afterwards - talking to the characters, exploring the (extensive) grounds, and unlocking upgrades.

If you have the patience and the time to fall in love with the characters, you will find lovely character interaction, witty dialogue, and some great wordplay and humour. Though the player character is a new addition to Marvel, I never felt as if they were a complete blank slate; they have a personality that I fell in love with throughout the game.

I know of at least one friend that has never completed an X-COM or X-COM like, because by the end he always gets tired of repeating missions over and over for a small payoff.

Feels fresh and innovative. Has that heroic flare with the on screen visuals; and requires some strategic thinking and deck building to earn max star ratings on missions. Clearly took some (NOT all) inspiration from Firaxis Xcom series. However, the actual challenge can be described by this metaphor - If Xcom 2 is ""3-dimensional chess"", then Midnight Suns is 'Go Fish"". The Warframe inspired card modding system, is what makes it drop from ""checkers"" to ""go fish"".

Card Modding:

This is not the only issue with the game, but it is the primary issue. I like the card modding system, but it was not implemented well. Firstly, this is a game that people actually pay for, NOT a freemium or free-to-play game. Therefore, why would the developers incorporate the extremely annoying RNG that plagues free-to-play games? The previously mentioned Warframe has better RNG than this. This kills any replay-ability as, you will never want to re-roll cards or try out different mods on your characters' cards to change up their play-style and tackle the same enemies/maps in a different way.

The second issue with card modding, is that the ""right"" mods make the game too easy on the higher difficulties. Granted, one can play without modded cards for an increased challenge. However, I see it as more of a lack of variety in enemies - that is, the same mods that are most beneficial against 1 type of enemy, in 1 type of mission, is also most beneficial for all others.

Story:
Mediocre (neither good nor bad). There were elements of the story that were good, and the characters all felt like they had their own personalities. The voice actors did a great job voicing the characters. However, there was a lot of bad writing scattered throughout the story, especially regarding hours of useless and annoying ""side"" conversations you were forced to do to level up characters.

Time Wasting Elements:
There is way too much time wasting elements in this game. I already mentioned the conversations. However, the ""RPG"" elements of running around exploring are boring and needlessly time consuming.

For example, your character is forced to run to their bedroom every day, go to sleep, and they wake up, run around the home base doing ""daily"" activities to level up characters, collect resources, etc. This can be enjoyable for some, at least in the beginning. But after a while you will start getting frustrated, being forced to run for 20-30 seconds from the ""mission selection room"" to your bedroom after every single mission, then wait 20-30 seconds for the next day cycle to load, to run 20-30 seconds back to the ""mission"" room just to start another mission. Then pile on all the other activities, and you start to realize how much time you are not actually playing and enjoying the elements of the game you actually want to do.

Even the ""card re-rolling for the right mods"" element is needlessly time wasting. You click, hold for 3 seconds, then pick 1 of the 3 mods you want. Why in the ... do I need to hold the button down for 3 seconds; not just for that feature, but for opening chests, starting missions etc. !!!Stop Wasting my Time!!!

I would say 1/3 of my play time is actually playing the game.

Conclusion:
This game tried to be too many things at once, and thus, falls in the category of lost potential. I don't even feel like completing the final act, as I am having more fun with other games, like ""Phantom Brigade"".

Then it started to click.  I really liked the combat.  The social part of the game also started to grow on me and after about 20 hours I started looking forward to the daily conversations with each of the characters.  They had different personalities, excellent voice over (except the male main character voice is sometimes a bit flat, like he was reading lines from his home studio  with little context to work with).  

The story also begins to really take shape. after you dig in.  Feels just like reading a comic book from the 90's and is better than any Marvel phase 4 story line.

I see some reviews that complain about TOO MUCH dialogue.  I can understand this when you just want to get into fights as quickly as possible.  I felt the same way at first.  But again after just chilling and relaxing into the game, letting it unfold as it does.  I wanted MORE dialogue.  More social interaction.  Yes, of course it is a bit cliche at times, but what superhero story isn't?  That is really the point.  It is what makes it nostalgic, comfortable and emotionally engaging at the same time.

My advice on this one is buy it for the combat, and learn to love it by taking your time with the dialogue and story and get lost in what is a love letter to comic books like no other game I have ever played.

Jogging around a map on regular intervals to check if certain ingredients are available? Well good news that's optional - mostly. Some of the story requires gathering stuff and doing exploration and you can use the gathered materials to craft helpful consumables. Harvesting isn't terrible but what would help is if you could jump over obstacles. For a superhero you're pretty picky about following paths. The spawn points only does so every few days so it's not necessary to go each night. On second play through I mostly ignored the collection after visiting the area the first time. You don't have to craft anything to get items, opening arcane chests regularly can keep you supplied with different consumables. As your arcane knowledge increases the requirement for keys to open the chests disappears so they can be raided every few days for a steady stream of items.

Midnight Suns has a day night cycle where you go on missions and craft items during the day and unwind with a relationship sim at night. Harvesting and exploration can be done at either times but some events and items will only work at night. Mysteries are included while exploring which unlocks other areas for more harvesting. 

Relationships build up by hanging out and doing activities that are liked by the other party and possibly offering gifts - even if those early gifts are just things lying around the abbey that you pick up which is a little weird. Sometimes there are tasks or favors that are asked of you. other times there are optional stat boost questions. When you receive enough friendship points you get a text to meet and afterwards rank up the friendship. Some of the conversations are comedy gold particularly during friendship rank up where the choice doesn't particularly matter as it doesn't affect anything so choosing the sillier choices can be hilarious. Who you choose to hangout with not only affects combat efficiency but also affects your hunter stats. These can be beneficial to the secondary benefits the stats provide like increased knockback range, area of effect, initial block value or turn by turn healing. Inversely, who you train with affects their stat progression while building relationship. You could focus on one team mate as a constant buddy but chapter fights tend to lock certain character picks. Additionally friendship levels increase preset stats on a character. It doesn't affect your character. Choosing relationships dialogue can affect dark/light balance which is a bit irritating. Dark balance choices tend to damage relationships. Why the balance is affected by dialogue is unclear but its more irritating than not. Playing a light balance means most relationships are smooth except for the dark balance people and vice versa. The good news is that you can butter up almost anyone in the group with gifts and activities during hangout, during daily training, and even taking them on missions. So the negative effect is offset easlly.

The missions are fairly similar but has enough variation to keep things interesting. There is at least one mission that is somewhat amusing since the character is supposed to stay at base but you can pick them anyways for the mission. So you end up talking to them on the radio when they're right next to you. Missions come with different objectives. Usually interacting or obtaining an item or person while defeating opposition. For the most part its basically a card battle with terrain overlay for secondary effects. Your entire team can have one free move that is not associated with a card. This move allows one character free map movement up until a card is played or to also shove once that combat perk is obtained. Modifiers can be added later. And item usage is free but are consumables. If you have the good Doctor Strange however you can recover those items to reuse.

The story is ok for comic book fare. Though your role is a bit vague. You are the ""leader"" yet there are cliques that have their own leaders. They dictate actions and you advise for the most part. This is largely scripted in events so in truth you are more of a counselor. Your choices only affect how your relationships stack with other people. There is no branching narrative that I can tell. Like most Marvel games dialogue can get abruptly cut off during transitions because the dialogue is verbose and default travel is running. To listen to everything you have to slow to a walk or stay in place. If you pay attention to everything and take the time to listen, its a story that is told well and to a certain degree has a strong impact.

Unfortunately the game has pregen characters so you can't make someone up. That is to say you can't choose a power set. You can modify appearance and that's it. The power set you do get has a couple of routes that you can select and upgrade. Added to that is the ability to add modifiers which can change how you use a power or allow for options if you discard.

Your character can equip different passives that can slightly alter combat efficiency but otherwise there is no equipment other than consumable items. 

New game plus is a bit bizarre. You continue with the same roster and friendship levels so characters you aren't supposed to meet yet are present - including frenemies. 

Overall I'd say give it a go. Now for steam deck fans, Good news it mostly works ok. At the end it's chugging a bit on the Final Boss fight. Playable but annoying. I advise changing to low graphics setting. There are surprisingly a lot of max level details on default.

I am going to start with those so I can geek out but essentially this game runs on Denuvo, which is an anti-piracy software that damages the performance of the game and as such is anti-consumer as hell. Its distracting and makes this game run terribly and I cannot in good conscience recommend this for PC until that is fixed,

It is also a card battle strategy game which is not for everyone, however the fun engaging gameplay fit to my tastes and didn't feel like a slog. The story and characters are well-written as well with a genuine tearjerker ending. 

There is also the fact that this game features an original character created by you for the Marvel Universe, which for some, is jarring. However they are a nice audience surrogate and let you get to know these characters better and explore one of my favorite sides of my favorite fictional universe.

The graphics aren't the greatest but considering my machine I was playing on lower graphical settings to optimize performance anyways. However I frequently encountered visual bugs.

As for now, I am not recommending the game due to Denuvo and the bad technical issues on the PC port, it seems to PC only as my friend who played on PlayStation 5 did not encounter the same issues.

The best and worst part of this game is the fact that you don't directly control your character's actions.  Instead, each character has 8 cards and can only perform the actions on that card.  You have a team of 3 characters and a limited hand size.  Normally you can only play 3 cards, although there are cards that don't count against that limit.

Not a lot of people are finishing the game.  I can understand why.  I think it starts a bit too slow.  In the beginning, your characters are pretty weak.  Your first few battles are frustrating as you try to figure out the mechanics of the game.  But if you stick with it, I think the game becomes really fun.  I liked the missions, the upgrading of cards, and the combos that you can create between certain characters and their new powers.  Moreover, the difficult has a sliding scale so you can adjust it to your liking.

This isn't pay to win.  I earned enough credits to buy the outfits that I liked.  The credits you can buy only go skins; it doesn't unlock your characters' power.

The story is fun and the characters are engaging.  The game play isn't XCOM, but it's different and fun in it's own way.  I think it's definitely worth playing and I hope it does well enough to justify a sequel.",1678472616,1678472616,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I certainly wasn't expecting an XCOM successor since I knew about the the card based mechanics. However I wasn't expecting this hot mess either.
This is a classic case of just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Why would you add 3rd person mechanics when it does nothing but add fluff? Time wasted walking around the base just to unlock the latest trash tier item you got from your last battle. All of the 3rd nonsense should have been scrapped and replaced with regular mouse point and click. 
Out of 12 hours of gameplay I suffered through, half of that was spent in cutscenes, corny Marvel dialogue (She Hulk quality) and wandering aimlessly to get from the place where you craft items to the one where you unlock items to the place you train and so on.
PC performance is poor. PC is way above the recommended specs (8700k, 3060 Ti) and even with RTX and launcher disabled the game stutters noticeably and has the occasional crash. All while having PS4 graphics.
It looks like they focused on the console market with how the interface is built and I'm sure they managed to balance PC and console out. Just because they alienated a lot of PC players so congrats on that I guess.
The upside is indeed the card combat and deckbuilding mechanics. It's both very deep, satisfying to use in combat and compelling outside it with theory crafting and figuring out party compositions. If I could do that at a steady pace without being bombarded with cutscenes and endless dialogue, then the experience would be worth it.
Perhaps modding will get it done.
As it stands I wouldn't recommend this even at 50% off.

This is a very odd game to try to review, particularly when it comes to recommending it as highly as I do.
The thing about this game is that almost everything about it--the art, character models, animation, writing and dialogue, and voice acting--are mediocre at best and sometimes laughably bad. The main character's running animations in particular stand out as a an example of ""did the developers really feel this was good enough?"" Let me explain:
The male version has a decent enough sprinting animation (though I wish he actually looked like he was sprinting to match the speed at which you move, not just briskly jogging), but the animation in between walking and running is hilarious. It looks like someone suddenly shoved a stick up his but as his back suddenly goes rigid and he pulls his elbows in to his sides. The female running animation is where it gets really really bad. The only way I can describe it is that she runs like a chimpanzee. She's hunched over, her arms swing in a really unnatural motion way out away from her body, and they go too low past her knees. It's bizarre.
But I'm not here to nitpick this game. I'm here to praise it. Because despite everything they didn't get right, the combat and game play loop is absolutely amazing. The game essentially splits itself into two parts: At the Abbey and In Combat. The Abbey is where you interact with characters in an almost dating sim-like fashion, and explore the grounds to find little secrets and uncover background lore about yourself and the inhabitants of the Abbey.

When you get into the combat phase, everything changes. The character models look better, their animations are actually smooth (for the most part) and the mechanics and puzzle-like nature of combat are exceptional. I LOVE this game's combat style. I want this to be translated into a board game ASAP and I will throw all of my money at it. I think the only criticism I can levy against the combat portion is that they lock some pretty crucial features (particularly around movement) behind upgrades that you don't get until way too far into the game. I'm all for introducing players to the basic system and then subsequently revealing more complicated features so that the player can get used to the new ideas without getting overloaded, but these crucial elements should have been made available much earlier.

TL;DR: Despite all of the things this game could have done better, they got the important parts right. This game proves (imo) that the most important part of making a game is the actual GAME PLAY. Get that part right and the rest can be forgiven.

I still tremendously dislike having to run around searching for them, but the core game is so good that I'm playing it despite this, and I recommend you do too.

Here is my original review:

What this game doesn't advertise is that you'll spend less time in the game's combat system and more time running around a giant forested yard mashing the E key to collect difficult-to-see reagents.  Perhaps this ratio isn't the same for everyone, but for me, I've definitely spent far more time outside of combat, wishing I could just play the next mission.  The combat system is really fun, so I'm hoping it evens out by the end, but after spending another half an hour mashing the E key, and expecting this to occur again many times in the future, I think I'm ready to post a negative review.",1677084645,1678457726,True,0,0,0.509900987148284912,0,True,False,False

Was sceptical at first after seeing alot of bad reviews but i have to say this game is pretty damm good.
Dialogue can be a bit cringe at times but the combat is where the game really gets its grip on you and makes you completely addicted.
Would even go so far as to say its the best and most fun turn based combat i have played

As for performance i only had 1 crash in total and fps was really solid and never really dropped below 120 fps  (capped) on max settings at 4k except for the last mission.
For some reason the last mission is horribly optimized and my fps went all the way down to 15 so that needs some serieus patching.

Also a bug with the Hulk mission when playing on ultimate dif that needs to be patched asap. Legit tought the mission was bugged cuz you need 1 revive to finish the mission and ultimate dif gives you 0 revives so you cannot finish the mission. Had to redo the mission on lower dif just to get a revive and that was kinda annoying.

Would give it a solid 8!

The only downside is the cameras!
The tactical camera is honestly a nightmare.

If you're prone to migraines and other neurological symptoms like me, be warned, you're going to have to do tasks on the Abbey grounds in small bursts. It honestly gives me motion sickness.

There's way too much grinding involved and a lot of the choices you make with characters don't really amount to anything but you getting certain new powers to yourself or that other said character.

What really keeps you wanting to play is the challenging combat and how fun it is, though even the combat starts to get really repetitive after a while.

The game suffers from a huge ""bug"" where if you do too many abilities in a fight that have too many effects, you will start to suffer huge fps losses. In certain bossfights this will happen. It's strange because you can save at that point, reload the save and come back with good fps again.

The story was pretty good, it was very fun to see all of these characters together fighting the evil. Some writing was good but if I gotta be honest, a lot of the interactions between the characters were extremely corny and sadly had that Marvel movie comedy to it. Huge Borderlands 3 vibes sometimes, which is something you DON'T want to have in your game.

A really strange design decision was to keep one of the coolest and strongest characters ([spoiler]Hulk[/spoiler]) locked right until the final mission. Which basically leaves you NO time to play with them, you are forced to grind boring missions with them which I just didn't have the patience for.

Last thing which was my biggest let down was that I expected it to be like XCOM too much. There is research and upgrades but you characters can never die. If you fail missions you can just restart them, well actually you HAVE to restart them or load an old save. There are no times in the game except for waiting for good stuff like research. There is no sense of emergency and no strategic planning in crafting or researching stuff. You just kind of craft and research everything you can.

I didn't read anything or watch anything about this game at all before going in. My brother absolutely LOVES it. Additionally, I was a HUGE fan of Ultimate Alliance and someone who is off the Christmas Card list now had mentioned it gave them very strong UA vibes (it does NOT at all, btw) so I bit on the digital+ sale. And while it's not a complete waste for me, I was definitely underwhelmed. The story elements are cheesy, but entertaining. The graphics, while a huge complaint for some folks, I think fit it very well. The voice acting ranges from competent to outstanding. What ruins it for me (and what will save it for the right person) is the combat mechanics. It feels very mobile-game. I do not like card/deck builders at all - again, not knowing what I was in for - but I gave it a go anyway. And I just absolutely hated the combat. You have a limited set of mixed offensive, defensive, and buff/skill cards which get drawn randomly, coupled with some very limited move/sacrifice/point based options in any battle. It honestly feels more like Ooblets than any other game I've ever played. Though Ooblets is mercifully much shorter in the battles department and has round limits. The battles in Midnight Suns drag on and on and you're clicking the same handful of cards over and over. I would have much rather had a set of skills with burnable 'mana' or even a non-card based opportunity system. But if you love card mechanics, this is probably very light weight and might even be TOO simple. I'm just one of those people who doesn't understand the need to shoehorn cards into systems. Looking at YOU, Back 4 Blood. The game also requests a lot of lore knowledge to *fully* take in. It's not required, but it certainly expands the experience if you're aware of some of the non-film Marvel storylines. That's one of the parts I loved, but could see it turning off a casual Marvel fan. Also, Tony Stark pulling a constant Shaggy Rogers re: g-g-g-g-GHOSTS got a little thick a little quick. Overall though, I can't recommend it for people like me, who aren't looking for card clickers. And I definitely don't love the mobile feel to everything, including monetization mechanics.

1 - Although I was worried this would be a ""card game"", the deck building turned out to be fun and one of the best parts of replaying the game and feeling your characters grow in strength. It doesn't feel like a card game.
2 - Micro-transactions/cosmetics aren't really an issue if you enjoy the combat, as you will play the extra general missions enough to get all the cosmetics for free eventually. The cosmetics have a lot of color variations, so it's a little half-baked if you actually enjoy collecting the cosmetics.
3 - Friendship building was like a shallow version of Mass Effect socializing. It's enjoyable/tolerable running through it once and rushing through on subsequent playthroughs. I felt the same way about exploring the abbey. It's tedious, but it doesn't take that much time if you want to rush through it.
4 - Performance issues were probably the biggest issue upon release, but for me some of it was mitigated by circumventing the 2K launcher as suggested by another reviewer. I didn't experience the freezing that some have from subsequent patches, but there were still some crashes. For me, the game is pretty stable now as of the Venom DLC.

My wishlist for future updates or a sequel:
1 - More ""passive"" Intel type missions where you can utilize your benched heroes for different rewards such as XP/gloss etc. It's a minor gripe, but it's odd from a story perspective that you only bring 3 heroes to the tactical missions and have most of the bench sitting at home. Having more missions to send your benched heroes on would better sell the urgency of the story.
2 - Loyalty missions incorporated into the Friendship system.
3 - Some kind of way to skip or streamline the non-tactical portions of the game on New Game +.  It would be good to retain the story and cut scenes, but having management portions of the game more like an X-Com base without the running around would be more enjoyable, at least for subsequent playthroughs. 
4 - More tactical mission types. There is already good variety in the game , so this will be a no-brainer if more DLC or a sequel is made.

You have premium currency, cosmetic currency, like 5 different ability upgrade currencies. That whole system really could have been revamped, and distracts from what is otherwise a great game. The voice cast is fantastic, graphics are great. the character design doesn't suffer from the same stunt-double syndrome that Avengers had.

I see a lot of complaints about all the dialogue, but for me personally, that's probably my favorite part of the game. I love all the conversations you can have with your teammates.

However, I love getting to know each character and what makes them tick.

The combat is really fun and makes you think. It's very similar to X-Com. The graphics are gorgeous, and the animations are beautiful. You really feel like a hero in this game.

So why Negative instead of Positive when I would prefer Neutral? 

- Talking. Too much pointless talking. I get that game designers wanted to develop the personality of each member of our crew, but it ended up either shallow, or thinned out due to ""likability"" system, with scarce handful of interesting motives available later. It's not tragic, we get a chance to learn some backstory for this particular iteration of Iron-Man, Logan, Wanda and so on, but again due to the likability system, it feels like each story ends up being a poor drama, where the main character is the savior, without whom the other superhero would crumble due to sadness. <Sob> Add to it an incredibly poor facial expressions, or even their lack outside of the main story and it makes it hard to get invested.

- Pacing and battle systems. The main story isn't bad, it's Marvel focused on the Arcane, in some ways the ""Abbey"" gives me Harry Potter vibes... But the title should be focused on battle more. There is such a potential in the battle system, it's satisfying, the number of heroes to choose from and their skills give us a lot of options and possibilities to set up powerful combos and to decimate the enemies, especially with the ability to use the environment, or even enemies themselves as a damage source. If I could move from one battle to another, it would be great, but we are locked in an unbreakable loop of: Choose battle mission, be done in 3-10 minutes, back to the Abbey for the Night phase, sleep, wake up in the Abbey for the Day phase, now you may choose another mission. It may not look like much by reading it, but doing it for 50 or 100 times...

- (By the way: certain passive character skills are locked behind likability system, so you better talk and talk and talk...)

- RNG and associated systems - each completed mission rewards us with a loot-box containing cards (active skills) of the heroes who participated in the mission. Later on you can craft those cards, but in order to get access to the specific card, you need to receive it at least once from the loot box. Best of luck!

- Cosmetics. Lots and lots of cosmetics ranging from entire new costumes for all the playable heroes, through their recolors, ending with options to casually dress up the crew while they're chilling in the Abbey. Some people will love it, some like me will consider it useless, even more when it comes to the main character. I was greatly surprised why the initial character creator would offer such a small number of options... Surprise! Ten times of that is available later on through unlocks. But! But, but! You don't simply unlock the modification. You unlock the option to unlock it, for which you still have to pay with the in-game currency.

The game certainly has potential, but the developers needlessly thinned everything out. Wait until it's on sale.",1678294027,1678294027,False,0,0,0.470704406499862671,0,True,False,False

There's a Venn Diagram at play here; Midnight Suns' target demographic is the middle point between Marvel fans (a relatively big circle, but if you're only familiar with the movies there's a good chance a few members of the cast will leave you cold), fans of card games, and fans of self-insert fanfiction.

Having said that, I'm speaking from the viewpoint of somebody who resides squarely in the middle of that Venn Diagram. I grew up on Marvel Comics even before the movies came out, and mercifully knew who Magick and Sister Grimm were before encountering them here. I play a lot of Magic: the Gathering, so the card battler system wasn't too hard to grasp; and I've written myself into more preestablished IPs than I care to admit. Thus, MMS scratches my video game itch like few other titles, and I've sunk WAY more time into it than I would most other games of it's sort (Slay the Spire, Fire Emblem Three Houses, and XCOM come to mind, all of which are excellent in their own way, but none of which I've played nearly as often).

Midnight Suns does a lot of stuff right. I could easily have seen this made into a shoddy live-service game like Marvel's last attempt at gracing the world of Triple-A gaming with their flagship team of superheroes, but fortunately, once you've paid for MMS, you own the whole thing (barring a few DLC characters, which I will discuss momentarily). You get the chance to have unique hangouts with basically every character; Magick has an entire side quest dedicated to her birthday, and the three extracurriculars you can participate in (EMO KIDS, Shop Class, and Book Club) give you a chance to get to know many characters.

Having said that, it's clear some characters get more love than others. I'm not sure why the creators are so obsessed with Magick; I don't dislike her, it's just obvious that she gets way more development in this game than some others I could Wolverine-I-mean-mention. Maybe it's because her relatively few appearances have made her character more malleable? ...But come on, it's clear Midnight Suns is working off it's own canon here. No reason to force every character to act like themselves. I'm pretty sure Blade and Captain Marvel have never even met in Marvel canon, and a minor plot point is hooking the two of them up in this game!

Or perhaps the issue is the heavy focus on our main protagonist. Not that I'm against characterizing your protagonist; far from it. I find Hunter far more compelling than most of those silent-protagonist-types you see in video games, where the player is meant to project themselves onto them. That said, the characterization we do get comes off as somewhat Mary-Sue-y at times; Hunter's struggle with their inner light and darkness feels somewhat forced when I can't really think of a compelling reason they would be tempted to the dark side. And a lot of their stuff can get in the way of other characters; I would've loved for the EMO KIDS to have an internal conflict a la Shop Class, but all their meetings are focused around flashbacks of Hunter's last experience fighting their mom, leaving little room for interpersonal drama. The most we get is Magick snarking at Dr. Strange once or twice. And Book Club is just... so boring. Feels like an afterthought. Shouldn't Blade, Captain Marvel, Wolverine, and Captain America have started, I dunno, a bodybuilding club? Those guys are all RIPPED in this game!

As for the gameplay, it's a lot of fun, for the most part. I don't SUPER love the card system, just because it puts a notable limit on our heroes' capabilities, especially when many key powers are locked off until postgame; why Blade's most reliable way of inflicting Bleed (the status effect all his other cards rely on) must be locked until you reach Relationship Level 5 with him, I have no idea, nor why the same must be said for Ghost Rider's Penance Stare. Either way, you're limited in what you can do by what cards you draw, which is fine, but it can be somewhat prohibitive at times if you only draw Hero cards but don't have any Heroism to fuel their use.

Some cards feel better than others, which is frustrating; the pool is limited enough as-is, we don't need to further dilute it with suboptimal decisions! One I especially have trouble with is Scarlet Witch's No More, her capstone Legendary card that kills her whenever she uses it. There's no way that I've found to circumvent it, it's just ""Immediately Kill Self: the Card."" A few others I don't love are Dr. Strange's power that replenishes used items (potentially good on harder levels when items are actually necessary) and Deadpool's ""Party Pinata"" that deals a hilariously piddly amount of damage.

Which might as well transition us to the DLC characters. At time of writing, there are two DLC characters out: Deadpool and Venom. Two more are promised, Storm and Morbius, both of which I expect to finish the ""vampyres"" subplot our first two players introduced. I'm enjoying playing with Wade Wilson and Eddie Brock (although Wade's kit seems eclectic and disjointed, with multiple dead cards that I don't much care for), but they're tangibly... well, tangential. Feels like the devs didn't really do enough to integrate them into the world, and seeing them awkwardly standing around and saying nothing during cutscenes kind of takes me out of the experience. Just add a few more cutscenes where Wade hangs out with somebody other than Blade, and Eddy talks to someone who isn't Peter, and I'll forgive it.

Finally, I'd like to reiterate that these are mostly minor points, coming from a place of love, and I do LOVE this game. Like, a LOT. Should the devs happen upon this review, know that I really appreciate all your hard work, and had more fun with this game than I've had with any game since XCOM 2! I also have a list of characters I'd like to see in the sequel, if the sunk cost fallacy will keep you reading until the end: The Black Knight, Polaris, Quicksilver, Jean Grey, Dr. Doom, and Emma Frost.",1678260459,1678291470,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

could be a lot better with some improvements

I've found the out of combat RPG lite elements are boring and repeptative whilst not really adding much. i've found myself trying to skip through most of the tosh. it isn't for me
seeing superheroes in swimwear, playing video games and watching films is a strange choice. adds to the grind, when the combat is why I'm here.

the other area that could easliy be improved is the overall speed of combat - everything takes an age. It would be nice to have the option to be able to reduce in combat animations as they get old fast. especially noticable when retrying missions.

nice graphics
nice feel 
but just feels like it would benifit from some tweaks to combat, the RPG side of things, and the dialog.

Just an FYI. You want to look at the whole battlefield, and that is the default on the Steam Deck. When I tried it on my PC, the camera kept zooming in - which is frustrating because you need to know the environment and placement of all the enemies at all times.

Update - roughly 20 hour in - I really like this game. It's definitely exceeded expectations. It feels like I am still early in the game - but I am more of a completionist (as compared to racing to the ending). Part of this is because I want to level up the whole massive team, so I keep playing with different characters. Also, the card approach has grown on me - and the balance seems to have shifted to more ""fighting"" and less socializing. The combat itself is all strategy - and a bunch of work goes into getting your heroes' decks upgraded and complimentary. 

Overall, I have really liked this game. I am still early in the game, but I am sure I will get my money's worth. I will complete the main game at least once. I have been obsessing about the game while at work, and I stayed up late last night playing - both good signs.

Pros:
1. Combat is fun (so far) - and surprisingly challenging even at normal difficulty.
2. I like the opportunity to improve characters (via their decks)
3. The team of 3 per mission has worked well so far. It also makes combat unique since heroes are not interchangeable. Your strategy wildly changes depending on who you have.
4. Deck approach makes every combat situation unique
5. I like that it's turn-based. It gives me time to think through options and strategy

Cons:
1. There just seems to be A LOT of busy work every day... like building friendships and exploring the grounds. I am not really a fan of the forced socialization - but maybe it will lead to more fun later. It sorta reminds me of Persona 5 Royal.
2. I suspect combat will get pretty repetitive later - once player cards are maxed out.
3. I wish there was more true customization of characters and attacks. So far, it's just aesthetics (clothing) and upgrading cards. It would be cool if you could add HP, strength, etc... However, maybe this happens later in the game.",1677621461,1678287334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is everything I've ever hoped for. A Marvel game, with tactics and deckbuilding. 

Alas, it is god-awful. I played it for so long just out of sheer obstinacy (and with the intention of making a review for my YT channel but I think no one cares about this game at all).

**I'll start with the bad. Some spoilers ahead maybe, who cares.

+It is built as if it was a mobile game. Maybe that was the original idea. What I mean by that: 
-You can only do 1 mission a ''day''.
-Every day you must do small, repetitive tasks.
-There are numerous types of currency to level up your cards.
-There are seemingly unecessary roadblocks in the story, forcing you to grind basic, repetitive missions.

+Speaking of story,  story is lame, the dialogues are lame, the friendship system is lame and just artificially inflates game time. I might need to replace my keyboard soon simply due to just smashing the ESC key to skip the inconsequential and stretched out dialogue. 
At least 10 ESK smesh with every character interaction, a few times a 'day'.

Speaking of game time, I think around 50% of my game time was spent in unoriginal, grindy combat.
What I mean by that:
-Most monsters are repetitive, bland and boring.
-Most monsters are designed to extend battle time without offering true or original challenge.
-A lot of them just spawn mobs, duplicate themselves or each other, and leech life from you.

+What is the point of the 'base'? Roaming around trying to solve puzzles that are completely unrelated to the story and ultimately, barely offer anything cool to the player.

The game will make your computer overheat like mad, to the point where I had to have the AC on AND blast my fan on my PC or else the game would crash (and I don't want to think about the damage all that heat could do).
Game was running smooth on Ultra settings but I had to tone it down because of the heat issue. Then, last battle for no reason, the game suffered from a huge frame drop.

I QUIT AT THE LAST FIGHT BECAUSE THE MECHANICS LOCKED ME OUT OF A WIN AND THE FIGHT WAS SO ANNOYING / BORING THAT AFTER 37 HOURS OF REPETITIVE, GRINDY BATTLING, I JUST WANTED TO MOVE ON. 
FRAME RATE MADE IT AWFUL TO PLAY THAT LAST FIGHT ANYWAYS, AND THE STORY IS SO BAD THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT SEEING THE ENDING. I can just go look it up on YT anyways, probably. I'm not angry, I'm disappointed.

**Here is the good:

+Graphics are great.

+Voice acting is amazing.

+Good cast of characters. I learned a bit from the characters I didn't know much about.
-Good diversity of mechanics for the heroes. They don't have a 'class' per say, but some are clearly made for DPS, tanking, buff, battlefield management, offering different strategies.

+Combat was fun for about 10 hours, until the monsters became lame.
-There were a few missions that I had to restart and adapt to the battlefield correctly to win, which made it very interesting. However, that wasn't often enough or became repetitive quickly.

+Tons of unlockable skins.
-However, the special skins you can only unlock through specific challenges were all unlocked for the final fight. So why bother?

+Card system is interesting and makes you think about your decisions.
-You can customize each hero's deck.
-You can add modifiers to each card, making customization pretty deep.

Everyone oozes character and personality. There are so many interesting conversations and callbacks to every heroes past and past marvel events. They do not skim AT ALL when it comes to the heroes interacting with each-other as well. 

Bottom line is this game should have gotten way more attention. It's a fantastic game and one of the best I have played in a long time.",1678228170,1678228170,True,2,0,0.520201981067657471,0,True,False,False

Combat is fun. I miss the XCOM style unit positioning but it is made up for with the card system, which allows you to push characters into different builds. Pace of battles is good and there is plenty of challenge as you increase difficulty. Variety of mission objectives could be increased. Random bosses appearing in missions is great.

The team social stuff between you and various heroes is pretty good overall, despite being a bit corny and tedious. Abbey exploration is a nice distraction, but a bit disorienting for all of the collecting they want you to do. Setting is a little too occultic if you ask me. Its heavy handed with the witchcraft, magical seances, and demons. I wish most of it could have gotten yanked out for more mutant and super power oriented lore. Social clubs and stuff can be a bit invasive to the game play loop; it really needs to let you do two missions a day to offset how much you are supposed to do in between.

Overall I am glad to see the video game universe is not subjected to the film restrictions that Disney and Sony are. Avengers crossing over into X-Men and other teams is a nice relief and reminds me of the classic comic book days. Gameplay loop is just fun enough to keep me going until the end.

Cosmetics are good. You can dress out every hero in different casual and combat attire and you can tell it to ""change daily"" which makes the characters feel more alive. There are some really neat suits that are pay-walled off but its not invasive at all.

Pros:
Great voice acting 
Nice graphics
Good selection of Heroes
Surprisingly good card based combat (Though forcing combat to tiny maps and pure puzzle play)

Cons:
2K launcher hogging resources (yes, you can disable it but still)
Anti-tampering bulls... in single play hogging resources
Repetitive Gameplay (Day's schedule)
Repetitive Gameplay (Running around seeking collectibles)
Anti-cheat tampering... forcing you to KEEP running after collectibles when you bored to death and would like to focus on the plot
Constant enemy upscaling (Whats the point to upgrade heroes?)
Stamp sized battlegrounds (Because of card play)
Repetitive animations (Stop-wasting-my-time mod would be great help after seeing animations 50th time)
Spelling mistake in the title (Yes, yes, SUNS is there because of woke garbage, I know)

I could live with rest of the cons, but the launcher and that anti-tampering crap that came along will keep me away from 2K products if those exist. I really understand the need for anti-cheat on online games, but in SP game this is just taking away the options from player and shoving the intended gameplay to boost game-time stat into gamers throat.

Unfortunately, -5 brownie points for Denuvo and 2K Launcher, as they severely hinder the performance. I experienced a lot of stuttering, graphical glitches, and bugs at launch. I suspect it would run better on an SSD, were it not unsafe for the drive due to Denuvo. DRM complaints aside, here's the overall review: 

- Performance improved greatly after patch and with 2k launcher bypassed. Frame rate still struggles at higher graphics settings and textures do bug out at times. Saving and reloading seems to be a reliable fix for the latter. 
- Combat is snappy, challenging but not obtuse, and truly gets fun after the initial grind of building your characters' decks. It's incredibly satisfying to obliterate multiple enemies with a legendary card backed by 10 heroism. Each character has a unique play style and there's a lot of room to experiment with squad combinations. 
- Dialogue is punchy and often lighthearted. If you're a Marvel comics reader, it'll be exactly what you expect. I chuckled at a good few cheap jokes. Luckily, the game knows when to match the tone and provides heavy, heartfelt moments when it matters. The voice acting is top-notch with a lot of familiar names. 
- Morality system is surprisingly well-balanced between Light and Dark. Unlike in the case of games like Mass Effect, you aren't punished for dabbling in both, and there's a neutral Power path available if you enjoy a happy middle. There are unique benefits and drawbacks to each path, but you aren't restricted from earnest roleplay in favor of committing to a pre-set archetype. You're also able to gain morality points outside of dialogue in a number of ways. I ended up with maximum Light balance even though I often picked Dark dialogue options. 
- There's no doomsday countdown and you're provided with endless general missions. You're able to take your time and progress the story at your own pace. I enjoyed the opportunity to relax into it, maximize friendship with the entire team, and thoroughly explore the Abbey. Makes the completionist heart glad. 
- Friendship provides a lot of sincere, feel-good time with heroes as you get to know them. They each have their own struggles, interpersonal drama, and all fulfill a unique relationship role with the Hunter. A lot of the subplot deals with the Hunter learning to lead the team and help them overcome their various issues. Many of their stories involve things like trauma, impostor syndrome, family conflict, mental health, etc. Building relationships with each hero was easily my favorite part of the game, and doing so is critical to achieving optimal combat. It gives the game a lot more soul than I was expecting and goes a long way to humanize the characters. The Hunter also has their own subplot that emerges through exploration. 
- Character customization is pretty cut-and-dry at the start, with more options (e.g. new hair and eye colors) available later. Good news for LGBT+ gamers: the Hunter is never explicitly gendered. They're referred to in exclusively gender-neutral terms and you can experiment with their gender presentation. My Hunter had a female body type and full beard, which looked surprisingly natural and gave them a fantastic transmasc non-binary look. As a genderfluid person, I couldn't be happier to have options outside the binary and not have the game contradict it. Representation matters and is often sorely lacking in RPGs. (RIP Cyberpunk 2077, you tried.) 
- Two minor gripes: First, one of the late-game characters feels like they were rushed out. You can't be friends with them like other heroes and it's a little disappointing. Second, the ending is rather open and I had hoped for a little bit more ""hooray, we won"" closure. It's still a good ending, I just enjoy a good bit of post-story aftercare before I go back to the main menu. Makes me feel like something is missing otherwise. 
- Yes, there are microtransactions. Yes, that sucks. I bought the Legendary Edition and I honestly feel it was worth it, as it's cheaper than buying the base game + season pass, you get all of the extra goodies and thus aren't bothered by the microtransactions. Is $100 a lot to pay for a game? Absolutely. What you get for the price is a 40-80+ hour game with upcoming DLC and shiny cosmetics, so it's up to you if that's worth it. I felt it was because this game ticks several boxes off my Marvel wishlist and I want the full experience. 

If you're not into Marvel, this game probably isn't for you. If you're hoping this will be XCOM 3, you're going to be direly disappointed. There are a few Firaxis staples built into it, but it's a very different experience with the primary intent of giving comic fans a large heaping of well-executed fan service. It's basically a found family fanfiction where you get to be the main character... do with that what you will.

EDIT: Had to come back after the Redemption DLC to praise what an awesome job they did with Venom. They were a make-or-break character for me. I'm a huge fan, have read all 217 currently existing Venom comics + the entirety of Lethal Protector, love their Sony movies, and have a LOT of opinions to be had, so I was really apprehensive about how they'd be characterized when joining the team. But, Firaxis pulled it off and did right by my favorite duo! Not gonna lie, I was practically starstruck meeting Eddie for the first time.

They advertised it as being the same team that made xcom 1 and 2, but don't buy it expecting the same thing.

Moves are based on cards, which draw randomly. There's no cover mechanics and most of your moves are centered around knocking enemies into each other or into explosive barrels and such. Overall mechanics are smooth. You can tell this game was made for controller, so I used my usb controller to play and its been easier honestly. Each hero has a unique playstyle and cards and you can pluck them out as you choose, so that's fun. You can redraw a card a couple times per round, which is helpful since you can only play 3 cards per turn. Does make you think. I would say half the game time is dialogue selection cutscenes and adventuring around your witch abbey solving puzzles, which i personally like, but if you're not into watching marvel movies then pass this one up. It's a marvel movie plot and drama through and through. You can skip to just doing missions every day, but I feel like unless you like superhero lore then you might get bored with this. Lots of voice-acting and lore vs actual battle time. Very long game with lots of depth. You can choose to be light, dark, or somewhere inbetween so replayability is there.

Lots of customization for your character and for the casual clothes of the heroes, but not much customization for the other heroes combat suits. They only get their base suits and some color changes for it. You can unlock ""midnight suns"" skins for the heroes and that's it, which requires getting their friendship with you to max. There are some awesome skins  you have to pay real money for, which kinda sucks. That's my main gripe. And there's no stats for armor or items, just modifications you can make to each hero's cards. 

To be clear this game is nothing like modern turned based strategy games like xcom, though. There's no cover mechanics. In this game you can be killed and still revive your peeps and you always start with full health on missions. Injuries persist if they get downed in a battle, but they heal after a few days. Xcom was a little more realistic and unforgiving in that regard. Plus its a card game now which adds to the element of random chance vs. the tried and true abilities of xcom soldiers, whose cooldowns were specific and you knew what you had to work with each mission. Don't get me wrong the game is great. Thumbs up.  But don't waste your money if you're a hardcore xcom fan looking for a similar experience.

Visuals awesome. My potatoe computer barely ran this, so I bet it looks awesome on a nice rig. You can definitely tell there was some big money behind this game. Voice acting is good and frequent. It's like watching a marvel movie. The gameplay mechanics didn't suffer on account of it either (thank you Firaxis) and its definitely fun. Well polished and few bugs.

The core game play becomes very fun and tactical the further into the game you get; at first it might be hard to fully grasp every mechanic and the most efficient ways to play. That sounds like a given, ""the more you play, the more you understand"" but I feel like a lot of people could easily give up on this game within the first few hours as it might not be what they expected or feels kinda slow. 
The game straight up runs like ass. After all the optimisation possible like disabling the 2K launcher or installing on SSD there's not a lot you can do to get the game to play on anything smoothly above 60fps unless you are willing to sacrifice high or epic quality graphics which I wouldn't recommend as the graphics themselves are already well below the quality of a standard game with this price tag.
The story and characterisation is very good. I enjoyed playing through the campaign, everyone has a personality and a role besides a few outliers. I feel like having DLC does enhance you're experience as the characters you obtain via DLC fit right into the story at whatever point you obtain them making content that wasn't originally in the game work very fluidly. Also all the designs in this game are amazing, Fallen Hulk and Fallen Venom are some of the best designed iterations I've seen of these characters.
There's a lot going on in this game and for the most part it's really captivating. With several things happening at once whilst still making each plot affect the other, it all plays very nicely and it really gets you invested in the main character. Hunter themselves isn't the most interesting character unfortunately in my opinion, despite how much lore you are given with them. You get the option to go down and light and dark path with Hunter and ultimately i don't think it affects the game play whatsoever.
I finished the game at around 44 Hours whilst doing DLC and side quests in that time and I enjoyed the majority of the game very much. I will say post game seems to be very bad, bit of a spoiler but all the events of the game seem to be retconned or just didn't happen, the only explanation of this is that Hunter woke up in a time before the events of the Finale and that's it. It really ruins any immersion you had in the game and the characters seem a lot more bland as everything that happened... didn't?

Sure, if you are a big fan of turn-based squad tactics and Marvel, go for it. A lot of people compare it to X-Com, and yeah, only because at a base level it's a turn-based tactics game.

To be honest the first 30 minutes or so I thought I had wasted my money and felt like getting a refund, but I pushed through and glad I did. It's basically like X-Com except every hero has a mini Card Deck. You collect and upgrade cards,  Build little decks of each hero.  Do research. Upgrade your base and various other things. 

One thing I liked about the game is simply exploring the grounds around your base. It reminded me of old tomb raider games, exploring and unlocking the secrets of the mansion. When you're not in battles you'll spend a lot of time in your base where you'll be bombarded with a ton of dialog. Like, seriously, a ton of dialog. This game goes heavy on the social/friendship dynamic. Which for most people I'm sure is the biggest turn off. 

No denying that 75% of the dialog is straight cheese. Chock full of insecure teen drama, mind numbing banter, etc. Some of it is so bad it's unintentional comedy. But the characters are all fleshed out and have their own personalities.  It's obvious the game was developed for a younger more international audience.

I see a lot of complaints regarding the 2K launcher, but you CAN disable that with a run config, which does improve performance.

Edit: After beating the game, my review is more or less the same. I think the game is great if you are a fan of either deckbuilders, marvel, or strategy games a la X-COM. The story is pretty typical marvel stuff, and characters behave exactly as you'd expect those characters would. Character balance could be a little bit better, with some characters being absolutely way stronger than others. Damage is king and defense/support characters took a huge backseat to the big damage dealers, with turn one damage consistency being the most important attribute for a deck. Because of this, the support characters that do not directly create more damage felt less important than other characters. Mission variety is also very low. Apart from the big boss encounters, the random missions all boiled down to ""kill the big guy before something bad happens."" Finally, replayability felt a little lacking to me. After beating the main story, there didn't seem to be much more of a reason to keep playing the game, short of replaying the story again on the harder difficulties.",1675832084,1678070498,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is fun, the voice acting is (mostly) great, the main game play loop is just the right amount of grindy, and the deck-building aspect and strategy aspects make combat engaging without being terribly complicated.

Premium cosmetic content?  Yeah... It's stupid that they put this stuff into a single-player game.  It's super easy to ignore... I don't know why the developers would want to waste time and money on something that nobody in their right mind would ever bother with, but hey - they probably had to kowtow to some idiotic ""business person"" to secure funding for the project.   Corporate greed hurts us all in the end.

The launcher and the DRM - more of the same stupid, wasteful stuff required by the publisher or some other greed-driven, MBA-having nobody.  I've been fortunate enough that they have not impacted my game play in the least - YMMV, but I don't think that you should let those concerns stop you from giving the game a shot (especially when it's on sale!!). 

The only thing I don't really care for is the ""friendship simulator"" aspect of the game.  As a life-long Marvel fan, It's just... annoying.  I don't hate it - I just wish it were more optional.

The car draw thing is not my favorite but I appreciate the effort. It does add some new strategy options.

I think what a lot of players wouldn't expect is that this game as a much slower pace than an X-Com game. I actually love this change. There are puzzles and lore around the Abbey to find, the Persona type friendships you develop with the rest of your team has an impact in battle, but it is also fun just finding out about who they are. The game loop is waking up, training with a teammate, and checking the forge and CENTRAL for any completed mission rewards, etc. Then there is usually a teammate wanting help, or to talk or play video games with. Then the mission and when you return you can roam the grounds looking for lore, puzzles or collecting herbs for creating consumable items.

I could probably spend countless hours trying out possible deck compositions, tactics and playstyles... but I won't. And here's why:

First of all, the turn based battle are only half of the game. The other half seems to be a hero friendship simulator, where you get to engage in mundane dialogues and can make meaningless choices. It's okay and fun at first, but becomes more of a chore to do between missions quite quickly. At least to me... I started skipping basically all dialogues that I still feel forced to engage in because of stats upgrades you somehow get from joining hangouts, etc.

Speaking of chores: The quality of life and UI are abysmal. You need to physically go to the different rooms of your hideout to access functionality. So after each mission: run to the forge to open you card capsules, go the yard to do your daily training and upgrade cards... possibly realize you need to craft another card for your upgrade... so back to the forge it is, then back to the yard before you head to your room for a good nights rest.
For the love of god, just give me a menu to use all facilities!  It's not a long walk by any means, but repeating it over and over again just gets annoying.

Same holds true for deckbuilding. If I change my strategy and pair up my heros differently I need to manually edit all their decks card by card every time I do so. Why are there no presets? Just let me save a few different decks per Hero and let me select them in the ""loadout screen"" before the mission. Would that be so hard?
Doesn't help that the menu is clearly designed for console usage with a controller in mind and doesn't offer much utility in terms of filtering your cards or a keyword search to look for specific effects and such..

But even then, I would probably not muster the motivation to try out most of the heros and their possible decks. The game makes you grind way too hard to expand your card pool, especially if you are looking for them nice modifiers.

Combat: turn-based tactical card game that allows you to position yourself around the map and utilize your environment. I fell in love with this concept, until I realized that the maps ain’t getting any larger and the environment and the enemies weren’t changing. Felt very repetitive. 

Gameplay: I split combat and gameplay for a reason. The majority of the time, you’re not in combat. You’re running around the Abbey talking to your favorite Marvel heroes, collecting orbs, trying to find mushrooms and whatnot around the Abbey, watching loot box animations (like why do I need to see Ironman and Dr Strange do the SAME, UNSKIPPABLE, animation and say the same quirky one liners for EVERY loot box). Half the conversations were lack luster at best. The other half felt like you were conversing with a high schooler. Now mind you, I think I skipped almost half of the content at the Abbey and it STILL took me 60 hours to beat the game. 

Graphics: the graphics were cool, but I have a BEAST PC and sometimes I wouldn’t get the full range of animation because of frameskip. For example, when Blade jumps up to do the Stake I would see him jump and then land on top of the enemy. Reminded me of the OpenGL days on CS1.6 lol. 

Recommendation: I know people are going to read my review and say “why did you finish it then??” Well to that, I say because I wanted to see if it gets better. Honestly, I kind of liked the plot and wanted to see how it would end.  Besides that, if the plot wasn’t there, I would have dropped this game at 30 hours.

While there may be some XCOM elements in the ""strategic layer"" of the game, Midnight Suns is nothing like XCOM.  Saying stuff like ""Scratching the XCOM itch"" is very misleading to people who, like myself, have been playing XCOM since 1994 and looking for different flavors of XCOM. That being said, I knew what I was buying by watching gameplay videos on YouTube. 

Now that I have that out of the way, I will tell you what the game actually is. It's a card battler. It's not a tactical game with card elements, it's a card battler with tactical elements. This was the main reason that kept me from paying full price for the game, but it was designed surprisingly well. In fact, the combat is easily the best part of the game and I really enjoy it for what it is. I probably should have waited until Midnight Suns was closer to 75% off before buying it, but I'm not upset that I purchased the game at the current discount. This isn't a reflection on the quality of the game, card battlers just aren't my thing.

One noncombat element is wandering around to each of your stations in a third person mode. (research, training, talking to your recruits, etc) It's comparable to The Krypt from Mortal Kombat; running around and unlocking chests, solving puzzles while building relationships with your dudes. This is what replaced the strategic layer in the XCOM games. Frankly, I hate it. Thankfully it's mostly optional... but I feel like this is where most of the development time went.

Even though the writing in this game is actually really good, I don't really care what's going on and I end up skipping most of the dialogue. I prefer to focus solely on the combat aspects in Midnight Suns. For those of you that are looking for a good story, good dialogue, and relationship building with your crew, this game does an excellent job in capturing those elements.

It's a great turn-based strategy game with the twist of the randomness of cards rather than the randomness of XCOM's iconic missed hit. I enjoy the fact that even if you have bad draws, you can still work around it by being able to shove enemies or trigger environmental damage to keep the momentum. Really opens up your strategic thinking.

And on the story side, we have a great roster of loved Marvel characters working together to save the world, as expected. There's some stretchy bits to explain the mixed bag of characters, but they do well to interact with each other enough to make the story not your typical run-of-the-mill. The plot is still very comic-booky, but it doesn't detract from the experience too much. 

As for the drawbacks, the biggest criticism I have is after enjoying side-missions too much, the battles do end up being repetitive. Yes, characters powers are varied enough to be unique, but the mechanics such as Quick and Knockback are important for every fight that there's a regular cadence you'll see the more fights you go through.

Updated.  My review of this game is now even worse after I beat the game.  See my original review below.  So yup same issues but wait there's more.  They added DLC and did updates and somehow made the game even worse and more buggy.  How?  You can see I've played this game over 100 hours, even after my negative review. At this point I guess it's my fault right?  My main issue other than the bugs, crashes, writing, story, dialogue, unfinished state of the game, and sloppiness, is the RNG.

Yes the RNG.  What is RNG you might ask.  Well RNG stands for Random Number Generator.  But basically it means randomness, as you have no control what happens in the game, even after careful planning.  Or just on how the game just plays in general.  For example the game play focuses around on getting and modifying your cards, this is all random.  Once you get the card you can apply a mod to a card to make it better, but you have to spend credits and resources to do it and then it's all random.  So you can sit there for hours trying to generate a specific modifier, spending all of your credits and resources to do so and not guarantee that you get the mod that you want. What they could have done was show you a table and purchase the mod you want with X amount of credits and resources instead of making you grind and inflate the hours that you played the game.  And should I even get started about the end of this game?  RNG, when it comes to the final battle as in you can't choose who you take in.  So... you have to upgrade everyone to be the very best and that is a lot of grinding their best cards and levels to make sure you can win. 

Speaking about the final part of the game... It throws your choice the player's choice out the window.  Everything you've done the game doesn't respect.  I was like WTF?! Why would they do that?  You played all light side, doesn't matter, now you're dark, your dark side won.  You unlocked all of the heroes Midnight Suns armor through their challenges?  Nope that was Tony Stark.

Are you still with me?  Let's talk about the dialogue and characters.  You'd think I would love everyone.  It's Marvel Comics characters.  Spider-Man, and Blade!  Nope, don't care.  Now.... Let's talk about another game.  Mass Effect 2, how many characters were in that game?  Like 13 with DLC, I cared about every single one of them, their dialogue, their character, their personality, everything.  I just did not care for anyone in Midnight Suns, and that is a crime.  How did they mess that up?

So I didn't explore all of the Abbey map, because I didn't care.  Also there is no mini map, how do you forget that?  I got turned around all the time, why?  Why wasn't there a mini bar showing how much resources I had all the time?  Like how much compliments do I have, what about how many credits, gloss, and the other resources?

And then 2K wonders, what went wrong?  Because the game was released in December?  And the sky is blue?  No, because you released an incomplete messy game that lives on nickle and dime-ing players.  Disney should sue 2K, make them pay for this loss that 2K created.

So you might ask me, what could they have done to make this game successful? Well I'll tell you...

Midnight Suns in not a recognizable brand.  The Avengers are.  So they should have called this, The Avengers: Midnight Suns. Also they should have released this game in full for $60, all skins, all content, and then... if it was successful, then release expansions.  That makes sense, right? 

And so I cannot recommend this mess of a game, please read below for further details.

02/05/23

A broken, buggy, unfinished, inconstant, nickle and dime, mess of a game. 

This is what happens when a game company values profit over players and releases a game in pieces for $60, then players need to spend an additional $50 for all the other pieces, all the while game testing and providing QA to the company for free.  YOU SHOULD BE PAYING US TO DO YOUR JOB TO QA A GAME.

This game had the potential of being really good.  The music is great.  But... Areas don't make any sense:  I climbed a ladder to get to an area, ok where's the ladder to get back down?  It's not there, in it's place is stairs??? A character will make a comment about another character on the team, the thing is I don't have that character on the team, whoops??? Music suddenly stops and drops in several places, in battle, at the abbey.  Difficulty is all over the place.  Someone will give you a quest but when you go to turn it in you can't, not without saving and reloading the game for the game to work properly.  The menu and loading screens are a slog and put a strain on my system, not the gameplay, the loading and menu screen!  And why???  Because of the loading symbol they used that uses massive amounts of particle effects?  Or the logos?  Why is there an anti cheat system in a single player game!?!?!?  I don't get it, how was this game released like this???  This needs to stop.  Players and professional reviewers please take note, we need to stop rewarding this behavior with money. 

This game leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I will not buy another 2K game, no more Civ, no more X-COM, nothing.  Same goes for any Paradox Interactive, EA, SEGA, and CD Projekt.  I'm tired of seeing games like this get good reviews, 8/10, 9/10's.  NO, THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

When I pay $60 for a DDD game from a AAA company, I want the whole game, I want it done, I want it not to be a mess.",1675601686,1677908044,False,1,0,0.477749645709991455,0,True,False,False

But the rest is ingeneous. They didn't just slap a Marvel IP on the next XCOM. They quietly fixed a few problems that most tactical/squad games suffer from:
 - Heroes don't die, they just get K.O ed and suffer Injuries. It's a subtle thing but it makes far more inclined to sacrifice a hero (for the current fight) if it means winning in the next turn
 - Losing a unit in XCOM (or the like) is debilitating: you couldn't beat the enemy with 6 units - how are you supposed to do it with now only 5... splat... 4... splat ...3.... In midnight you only lose options to chose from, but you can still play the same 3 actions. Losing a unit isn't crippling
 - You can't start on the highest difficulty level. Difficulty levels are earned over time (and maybe even with skill, can't tell), which mostly removes a lot of whiny morons from the review pool

It is not without fault though: 
 - a lot of content is a ""homage"" to XCOM (read: they recycled assets, animations, technologies etc)
 - the visuals are embarrassing. you can't play in 4k - the settings just contain the option
 - the visuals are embarrassing. Models would look good in a birds-eye XCOM level camera, but for an over the shoulder game: weak sauce
 - the visuals are embarrassing. Even with low poly models, low resolution and pretty cheap effects, a 3080ti struggles

Faraxis Games have done a great job, my only real criticism is the PG feel of the game. Midnight Suns always felt like a mature property so I would've liked it to be pushed in that direction but I feel that more of a higher up decision than a developer one. 

All in all, I think this is a must play and a must buy. I want to see more of these games from Firaxis, who actually releases a finished game. 

Also, Faraxis, please for the sequel, allow me the option to romance Wanda or Illyiana. Thats all I really want at this point.

Edit: So I just finished this game at close to 80 hours. I havent had a game have me this invested since Persona 5 in terms of hours.

Final Thoughts: While its not perfect, Faraxis made something special with Midnights Suns. In the final mission I wanted to make sure that I was as prepared as possible to tackle the end game boss. What I found was a game that rewarded me for all my prep work. Taking the time befriending your companions, while building the best deck possible for each made the overall final experience well worth the 80 hours I put into. A sequel was teased and I hope that it is followed through as there is something very special and new here and I would love to see what the dev team can do to improve and build upon a already great game.",1676663341,1677835223,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only downside I see is that if you're a comic fan, but don't like xcom style combat you might begrudge the missions to get to more story. The inverse can also be true. If you like the combat you'll side frown at all the dialog. Enjoying both makes me very happy; although I can see how this might have been too niche on both sides of that spectrum.

I thoroughly enjoyed it. There seems to be a memory leak where graphic loss would happen, but besides some weird psychedelic effects on the terrain; it didn't hinder my enjoyment. Exploring the abbey was a nice touch too.

It was a very well done story. Very enjoyable combat. My only real gripe is that they seem to have this odd cash shop currency that has no purpose. I didn't look long for it's purposes, but it seems to be an abandoned design strategy. 

As a standalone game it was worth the time I spent. If I had two items for a wish-list: the first would be that I wish we gifts once a day just like we can give compliments once a day. It's a weird mechanic that you can only give a gift during a hangout and a hangout may not happen at all at night. The fact you can choose to buy 3 gifts a day (once unlocked) quickly results in a stockpile of useless gifts you might be able to offload one ... once every seven days. I'd even like to be able to salvage those gifts of something.

The second wish would be that when you are rolling a gamma coil that the card would display the type of material it will salvage into. It reaches a point to where I might be trying to get some attack essence, but I have to remember if that card type can be salvaged into what I need or not. That would just be a nice add. Like an icon on the top right corner or something.

Combat wise once I figured out how to set up the best decks for my heroes game play went smoothly. Some heroes synergy better with others, but overall I didn't have major complaints with any one play style. Once I got the hang out the environmental combat aspects the game really hit a stride.

Also it has has a new game plus mode but after 120 hours I'm a bit burned out. I'll probably go for another run through in a year or so, when all DLC has come out and maybe there's a couple of neat mods.

8.5/10 (the game is held back by too much unbeblievable friendship management bla bla that takes time away from the juicy stuff but it's still just so good. Buy it & play it to support the studio. I want the X-Men Version of this game!)

The only complaints I have is that the game crashes A LOT, i wish the game would let you do multiple missions a day instead of making you sleep after 1 cause when the games loads from the abby to the character select to limbo to the actual mission then back to limbo then back to the abby after. and the game takes a good bit of time to load, could just be my machine but it could take up to 3-5 minutes at times. Other then that this is a pretty fun game yes it has DLC skins but it's really not needed and can 100% be ignored. I would say the DLC characters are kinda required cause the game feels a little empty without them.

The Marvel lore is done incredibly, and it's clear they spent a lot of time to make interacting with all the characters an amazing experience. The voice acting is spot on and I'm blown away by how much content there is for just interacting with characters (including the friendship meters for each character).

If you aren't too interested in the Marvel universe, you don't really need to bother with that side of the game! You'll miss out on a couple character upgrades, but by late game those are mostly irrelevant. The combat is so incredibly unique, and I've never played a game that I can compare it to. The cards let you use certain abilities each turn, but there is also a ton of combat options that involve positioning around the map and setting up combos between characters. The strategy aspect is where I think this game really shines and I highly disagree with anyone that thinks exploring the abbey and interacting with the characters is the main part of the game.

There is also base building elements, and I enjoyed completing the tasks for certain upgrades and deciding which facilities to build with limited resources (just don't expect XCOM and that sense of urgency). For the exploration part of the game, I found it pretty fun but again it's completely optional and the game tells you this after you finish the tutorial in the abbey.

I dont write reviews often but this game really deserves more recognition than it's been getting so wanted to share my opinions!

I was playing the new Hogwarts game and having a good time but have dropped it to continue on with this game instead. Honestly the best marvel game since Ultimate Alliance 1, and it might be better (unless like me you binged UA1 with 3 friends and a bunch of caffine and snacks one night). I do have some complaints, while most character portrayals are on point the actual dialogue can be pretty cringe at times, and when you make dialogue choices they sometimes say something completely different. I've never been a fan of create your own character, and this game is the perfect example of why. The Main character is literally called ""The Chosen One"" multiple times and revered right away for ""A Special Quality"" that just doesn't exist in their poor charisma and shotty dialogue. But they need you to feel special and for us that separate ourselves from the character they don't really do a lot to earn the respect that everyone gives them. A side from this the story and gameplay are pretty fun and the side activities seem for the most part to be completely optional. While you might eventually need to do them to keep up with the difficulty curve, so far I haven't had that problem. So if you can look past the cringe dialogue and the sub par main character and enjoy this game for what it is which is a good story with great gameplay and characters that do seem to be right off the comic page (from a character perspective), then yeah buy this game and the DLC its super fun.",1677713254,1677714497,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Therefore, I decided to just list them. 

1. The battles are quite short and you dive right into combat whereas this is different in for example XCom where you need to approach the enemy and think about positioning before the actual fighting starts. 

2. The exists no hex-field or anything like that to position your team. At first I thought that this may be an issue for me but it turned out that the gameplay didn't require having such a grit. 

3. The story is immense. If you are interested, you can spend hours talking to the heros and listen to their stories. For me, it was a little bit too much. In the end, I just kept on fighting and I did't really care anymore for the story, which I thought was sad, but I just couldn't motivate myself to listen to the story. 

4. Discovering the abbey was also fun, but the collection of plants and mushrooms especially in the endgame annoyed me a little bit.  

5. I really liked the graphics of the game. They are quite fun. 

6. Unfortunately, after the last mission, you just return to the abbey and it fells like nothing really happened in the end. You can still do mission and keep on playing. In principal, I like the idea of starting a New Game+, but somehow I just don't see the point in doing so...

In general, this game was fun and I would recommend buying it. However, one has to be aware of the fact, that there are just major differences compared to other turn based tactical games.",1677653679,1677653679,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Performance is just as a lot of people already said, stutter a lot and really need improving.

Now about the game,
- This game is similar to Xcom: Chimera Squad. You get a number of unique soldiers to use, but they're hardly balanced. Some heroes are vastly overpower while some you have to bring them along as a handicap just to unlock certain things. 
- Combat is basically a card game, highly random and not much for tactics. Still enjoyable but you should expect that with a rotten luck you may struggle when you shouldn't.
- The story outside of main story is...meh. You go on making a chat with someone, answer something and give them gifts. Content is just everyday life which is hardly interesting and after a few times it's become a chore. They also lock some combat bonus behind these relationships so no skipping them. Seriously you'll spend more time seeing them chitchat than actual combat. 
- Abbey (main base) exploring is almost pointless. Mostly it's very little, negligible bonus and a few cosmetics. You may choose not to do it at all and not missing much.

if you plan to buy it, I'd recommend waiting for a heavy discount. This game is not worth the full price.",1677650868,1677650868,False,1,0,0.447761178016662598,0,True,False,False

After 75 hours or so, I can't take it anymore. I hate to leave the game unfinished, but the story part is just way too bad, and there is too much of it. I spend maybe 10% of my in-game time actually playing the tactics battles and have to slug through 90% of the really bad filler.

The strategy part is good. Maybe even great. But just can't listen to young ghost rider talk about how he does everything for his little brother, or the Russian girl (can't even recall her name) do her angsty act.

Did I change my mind (this review was negative before) radically? No, only slightly. If there was something between ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"", I'd pick that option. There still are things that bother me about this game. I have now progressed a bit after starting over the third time, and it's OK, but not anything close to awesome or amazing. 

It could have been great... a turn based strategy game by the makers of the X-Com remakes, with Marvel superheroes thrown in. I was willing to give it a chance, even though I found the system with the cards a bit weird. I mean ""OK, it's my turn and of the amazing powers I wield... I can only use these two, because that's what my card deck gave me this turn"". 

It was an interesting attempt, taking a simplified X-Com and adding the randomness of cards. It makes it a bit harder to get fully immersed into planning too much ahead as it depends on which cards you get. Sure, in an X-Com game, you have RNG (enemy placement and movement, missing shots), but in general, you feel a bit more in control. The formula of this game cranks up the RNG/luck factor and dials down on the strategy. Play your three cards, spend your heroism on using items in the environment or save it for a bigger move in the next turn, it's up to you. 

Now, here are some of the bad parts:
- Dull enemy waves. For most missions, at the beginning of each new turn, 2-3 trash mobs will join. Again and again. I don't dislike the X-com thing with ""OK, 2 turns from now, reinforcements will join"", but here it's ""yawn, another turn, another two of these trash mobs""
- Bosses have to be killed twice. Why? Dunno. I don't find them too interesting anyway, so having to kill them twice feels more like a chore.
- When the same dull trash mobs ran in or the boss got up again, I was really rolling my eyes most of the time. Don't get me wrong, it can be interesting if this happens a few times during a game, when you don't expect it. It can add a challenge or throw off your strategy. If it's this predictable and repetitive, it just feels like needlessly prolonging a fight or replacing more interesting mechanics with just more trash mobs. 
- When you manage to wipe out a large group of mobs, it feels more like luck (yay, I drew the cards with chain attacks, some quick attacks and the enemies stand close to an exploding barrel) rather than strategic planning. 
- The dull story
- The dull story mixed with the feeling you're hosting a summer camp for some teenagers at a mansion. ""OMG, the world will end, Lilith is coming, it will be horrible. Shall we play some games on a console or hang out at the pool?"" Priorities, right? 
- The dialogue. I mean, yes, it's a super hero game and maybe the recent overflow of Marvel movies and shows has tired me out, but the ""coolness"" and snarky/sly/way too cool dialogue is just cringe-worthy. EVEN FOR A GAME BASED ON COMIC CHARACTERS!
- The same old little cinematics every time you research an artifact or open a box. SO repetitive. 
- Even if you enjoy the combat, you will spend a LOT of time running around the mansion, trying to manipulate the others into liking you by picking the answers they think they wanna hear. 
- Are there chars you like much more than others? Well, sorry, you better develop them all and their skills, because you will have to use them all at some point, even the ones you dont like for their abilities/playstyle. 
- Hunter, your character, is so one-dimensional and dull, it makes characters like Captain Marvel or even some random soldier in X-Com look like it's a world class high brow literature character. 
- The whole shtick about him waking up and adjusting to the modern world, which comes up in the dialogue, has been done so often before. Thor called and wants his character trait from the first movie back. 

All this sounds quite negative, and yes, if I had to rate it, I'd prolly give it, at most, a 6/10. It had a nice idea (X-com with card battling), and I was hoping for something really good as I like the studio's previous work. However, there are too many cinematics, too much of the social chit-chat, chilling at the pool, trying to raise your friendship level with characters that feed you a ton of ""sooo coool"" lines, and the combat isn't THAT interesting, sorry. 

So...
... if this is on sale (at least 20-25 percent)...
...if you are not tired of cliché comic book dialogues yet...
...if you want to support a studio you like which put out a rather mediocre game, but you want them to keep going, doing better games again...
...if you wanna try the mix of RTS with cards...
...and if you don't mind a dull story with a very one-dimensional ""pick the right answers to make the others like you"" part...

then give this a try. Look up the guide on how to disable the useless launcher which makes the performance worse. PErformance was ok, I only had one CTD so far.

- The graphics are pretty alright.

Cons:
- The writing is pretty terrible.
- The voice acting is mediocre to bad at times.
- The game has some visual hiccups at times.
- Modifying cards in the game require a lot of grinding and RNG.

It's a fun game but I think the writing holds it back by a lot. Iron Man doesn't feel like Howard Hughes or Robert Downey Jr. He feels more like Elon Musk. Dr. Strange is super arrogant and narcissistic, Captain America is cold and aloof, Wolverine is super friendly and approachable..

Yes there are some glitches, but many of them were resolved when I updated my graphics drivers.
I'm running the game on a i7 4790K@4.6Ghz, RTX 2080S, and 32GB of RAM with RTX enabled, DLSS balanced, and everything epic except for shadows and my FPS are okay. Lowest I've seen is north of 40, but it seems to fluctuate between 50 and 60 which is fine for my 1440p  60hz monitor. But truth is it's not the sort of game where you need high FPS and monitor refresh.

What type of game is it? Well it's a like a mash up of card collecting, X-COM style combat (kind of), and a CRPG with an almost exhausting amount of conversation, exploration, collecting different resources, and upgrading cards/abilities. Don'y get me wrong if you're like me and enjoy the last bit, you'll love the game. If not it'll seem like the grind of all grinds, and might turn you off. Lastly in this regard hero personalities/voices may not align with expectations/lore, but after playing for awhile it's less jarring, and I can live with it.

Combat is where the game really shines. X-COM in spirit but instead of each player character having fixed abilities, they have associated cards that can be combined and/or upgraded. Then as you battle NPCs you have a ""hand"" that you draw cards with different abilities from with the aim of building up hero points that then enable more powerful cards. While I enjoyed X-COM, I'm actually enjoying this system more. It's much more flexible and allows me to really tailor my tactics to my preferred play style.

The first 5-10 hours are great, it feels like you're constantly making your characters stronger, figuring out the combat system, discovering stuff on the abbey grounds, and chatting with your team. 

Around 10 hours you have really seen everything the game has to offer. There's no awesome boss fights, missions are all generally the same (kill things play a card), and there's not a TON of moves for each character. Some cards are just definitely bad, and its obvious the best way to play each character, so a lot of the customization is a waste of time. 

There's also SO MUCH BLOAT. Not even in a fetch quest type of scenario, but theres only maybe 15 story missions, some of which take 5-10 minutes, but you have to do a regular mission in between each one. Every  animation just feels like wasted time, every menu is a 10-15 second walk between them, every menu is hard to get to from the other menus. End a mission and get a booster of cards you want to open? You will have a cutscene of you returning from the mission, you will then have to run back to the abbey, then you will get a cutscene that warps you to your room, then you have to do the hangout/dialogue options if you care about that, then you can go to sleep, then there are 3 cutscenes of you going to sleep, waking up, showing a random scene of the abbey. Finally you can run 25 seconds to the booster pack opening section, then you can exit that menu and you can open your hero menu, then you go to edit deck, then you can add the card to your character. Want to upgrade a card? Run another 15 seconds to a different NPC vendor, need more essence? Run 30 seconds to a vendor for essence. Want to disenhant your unused cards for more essence?

A lot of performance issues with stuttering frequent enough to be annoying. The 2K launcher is terrible, but you can get around it.  

I like the writing overall. The sections I've played through have been genuinely funny and captured some good spirit of the characters. I don't especially like YOUR character that you create. I'd have preferred just managing the team, rather than having to be an active participant.

I don't like the card-based combat. There's certainly a skill in deck management and whatnot, this is just not how I expected the game to play. It doesn't feel ""strategic,"" it just feels random. Sometimes Iron Man gets to shoot 3 times and nobody else does anything, or whatever. I had hoped this would feel a lot more like X-COM.

I'm mixed on the environmental combat. You can maneuver characters to sometimes interact without using a card; kicking a piece of furniture through 5 bad guys or picking up a rock and throwing it at a dude are the intro examples. Like the card system, it seems interesting as a concept, but I just don't like the way it plays most of the time. It's mostly just hoping an enemy ends their turn in the right spot to attack them. As you gain abilities to get more moves in a turn, you can manipulate the terrain a lot more interestingly, but it takes a lot of time to get there.

There's this whole thing with running around the Abbey to gather mushrooms and junk to have the materials to do things. If you like harvesting mechanics, maybe this part of the game is for you. I find it tedious.

BUT, overall the characters are on point. There's some genuinely funny dialogue scattered throughout your interactions with the team. They clearly are trying to bring in the type of conversations you see the heroes have during personal downtime moments in the comics. A lot of that is done pretty well.

I don't actively hate anything about the game; I just feel like it and it's DLC are overpriced. Buy this whole thing 50% off and you're getting a good Marvel story for your money.

There are mods on Nexus that are rebalancing cards and mechanics; I think some of them make some really essential changes that will improve your experience.

I don't recommend games very often or make reviews, if you enjoy real time strategy, action or even just comic book lore. This game will give you hours of entertainment with multiple play-through capability. The DLC released for this game has also been well made and feels like the money you are spending on the Season Pass or even just shelling the 14.99 on the individual, it feels worth it. 

The game isn't perfect, there are slight moments and things that I wouldn't mind changing. But it's mostly quality of life jargon that has honestly been fixed with patches and the new DLC packs.

This review for “Marvel’s Midnight Suns” has been a long time coming and I’ll not bury the lead by stating that I absolutely love this game.  However, there are some concerns, easy fixes and just flat out problems with the game that may concern potential players, with that said I’ve a lot of notes and this may be a bit long.  Let’s discuss!

Today’s Apocalypse:  Mechanically, this game is more of a card based puzzle game than a true turn based rpg.  Yes, you have a great deal of customization when it comes to picking your deck but combat truly shows what it is when you are trying to find that combo that will destroy that target with the limited resources you have.  The game is challenging, at least in the beginning, like most games of its type when you start to understand it and have the resources to customize it to your style the game does become quite easy (at the base difficulty level).  One interesting mechanic is that ‘bosses’ can attack you during waves, which I found broke up the random general missions.  They are weaker than their actual boss forms but it adds an interesting shift in combat when they appear.

Marvel’s The Sims:  At the core this game truly shows who it is through the interaction with the Marvel characters you recruit over the course of the game.  You will spend a lot of time just talking to characters, exploring dialog options and getting to know back stories.  This can actually be considered the main part of the game for some.  You can improve your friendship with all but one of your heroes and it actually blends gaining new abilities and seeing new dialog so that players are encouraged to achieve these levels.  With the social aspect of the game being so important it was really nice to see there is an indicator that tells you that there are more people to talk to so you don’t accidently skip them.  There were times when I would have preferred an establish character outside of Hunter but she grew on me over the hours.  I would be very interested to see if / what they do with her in the coming years of the comics.

Reality TV:  First and foremost above all other concerns this game is in dire need of a sort option and mainly just some quality of life improvements in the UI.  Combat Cards specifically are a nightmare and felt like it punishes you for buying too many.  Additionally there is a certain ‘quirk’ to talking to characters, sometimes they have new things to say when you are in ‘proximity’ and if you move too close they cancel that conversation so you have to learn to do this ‘poking’ style to ensure that you don’t miss content.  You also have no way of giving gifts outside of hangouts and even getting the option to do them seems to become rarer and rarer like the game eventually expects you not to want to do them.  Add to this that many achievements are bugged, for me it seems it’s just the DLC (more on that for their reviews) but for some quite a bit more.  There are a great deal more concerns of course but I personally never felt any of them were game breaking, though one of the characters (won't say who) is incomplete in my opinion.  They have no friendship level and even if it was 'intended' just feels wrong; like missing content and fans of that character now miss out on what should have been a lot of content.

Overall this game is need of a lot of quality of life improvements but I absolutely love this game.  If you are a fan of Marvel and like the idea of talking for hours with some of your (potentially) favorite Marvel characters with a combat system that is interesting and new then I’d highly recommend this game.

Coming from the Developers of the genre defining XCOM TRPG... the JRPG style systems are interesting as it gives an insight into the backstory of many heroes thrust into the light of the MCU in recent years...However, Midnight Suns may not be for everyone...

PROS:
-Diverse and intresting cast
- each character has a role to play and all are voice acted
- Main character is basically classless and your free to shape
- New combat style is interesting and can be quite fun
- Card based abilities means you have to use each character and team building becomes important by the end game
- No Character is a copy and past of others and have distinctness from others in the cast
- All things are unlocked in game and alignment choices feel rewarding by the end of each tree
- Boss fight is utterly epic and quite intense
- Some characters require a deep understanding of the game mechanics to work well

CONS:
- new combat system is for some not for others
- enemy scaling was off at time of play
- moral choices and character relations distract seem to be about dragging the game on
- The mix of all the systems doesnt always sit well.
- Card system can make combat brutal and either unfair or a breeze.
- Cosmetic system and the in game purchase seems to be a standard with any MCU game and Doesnt add any value to the overall experience.
- Some mechanics feel like they were taken from mobile games and dont fit.
- Some cast members are added way to late in the story and seems like final chapter was rushed.

In conclusion: Midnight suns will be fun for some. It is an experimental TRPG with a mix of JRPG mechanics trying something new in the space. For what it is the developer nailed it. Whether this concept of TRPG will stick or not... Not my call to make... 

We sure aren't in XCOM anymore thats for sure.

My Rating: 3.8/5 for the price tag i got plenty of entertainment out of it and will make adjustments upon a second play through once all DLC characters are released. 

I overall am not a fan of this version of TRPG combat. Though the idea of ""Ability pools"" on character classes is a very intresting one and maybe an intresting twist of ""Class building"" in hex based TRPG",1677423789,1677423789,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Decent friendship simulator mechanics and mild exploration at a home base area between highly addictive combat mechanics. 

Roleplaying- It's not super in depth, conversations offer paragon of good, real person, or edgelord options to respond to characters. some characters like when you say paragon of good stuff like captain america. Saying the right thing will increase their friendship with you unlocking color palettes and eventually their ultimate card.

Exploration- You live in a big ol place called ""The abbey"" that has a decent sized map to walk around and explore, just basic walk, sprint, interact, so no verticality. There's ingredients for crafting and mysteries to solve. Certain things you find open more paths to explore further. I was enjoying this aspect fine enough but i got towards the end of the story and have been grinding other stuff and havent returned yet.

Combat- The best part is a really fun combat system with teams of awesome marvel characters and your create a character protagonist. As you upgrade your base and characters you can get some crazy turns where you can clear the enemies off the map and be set up well for the next turn. I could use more variety in the levels and enemies but its not bad, just a little more.

The game is really solid and fun and ive been playing it non stop for like 5 or 6 days (80 hours) but i feel like the only things stopping it from being a 9 or 10 out of 10 are...

1.Needs more cards per character for more variety, id say 2 of each card type would probably be enough.

2. Needs just a little more level and enemy variety.

3. The story should have been a little longer (I'm currently at the last mission and can't say for sure if there's any post game but i will edit this when I do that)

Thats all the negative but the characters are all portrayed very well, great voice acting all around. I love the conversations people are just having around the abbey and the dog friend Charlie is just a joy. The story works great for comic book style hijinks.

It has some technical issues, but those are completely overshadowed by the excellent gameplay and incredibly strong writing.

Long Review: Midnight Suns is a turn-based tactical strategy, with the closest comparison being games like Xcom or Phoenix Point. Instead of a squad of soldiers, each battle brings in your hand-picked trio of Marvel superheroes, each possessing a deck of ten cards. These consist of Attacks, Skills that give you more defensive or tactical options, and Heroics (aka, your big flashy super moves). These combine into a thirty card deck that you play from, using various card synergies and strategies to defeat opponents that often outnumber you.

This leads into the second lair of combat: the environmental items. Each battlefield is littered with objects to throw, boxes to kick, and explosives to detonate that don’t take up your precious card plays. Many heroes have abilities to knock back or outright throw enemies, which gives you a ton of variety in combat. Throw an enemy at an explosive barrel. Throw them at a generator to electrocute and stun them. Throw them off a pit for a chance of instant death. Throw them into a nearby ally for a combo attack. Throw them into another enemy to deal damage. Combine this with some Heroes cards (For instance, Ghost Rider can open a portal to Hell that you can throw bad guys in…) and it keeps combat pretty fresh and varied.

The roster is decently sized, clocking in just under fifteen different Heroes (not including DLC), ranging from most of the iconic Avengers like Iron Man and Captain America to some more obscure picks that suit the setting, like Blade, Ghost Rider, and Magik. This game focuses on the more “mystical” side of Marvel (more Doctor Strange than Thor, for instance), but a few oddballs like Spider-Man and Wolverine round out the cast pretty well. Each character’s cards and fighting styles feel very different, and each Hero often has a few different ways to use them depending on your team comp and personal preference For instance, Spider-Man can focus on abusing environmental attacks, setting up a chain of many strong attacks, or building up to his flashy Heroics.

The main story is nothing amazing: A super-demon is going to destroy the world and the Heroes raise an expert demon hunter from the dead (That’s your create-a-character) to kill them. The characterization is great though. It has its cheesy moments (like any good hero story), but most of the cast feels pretty thought out, just as distinct as their gameplay. They’re pretty distinct, fun, and interesting versions of the characters while keeping the elements most people are familiar with. Tony Stark, Doctor Strange, and Scarlet Witch in particular were some exceptional standouts compared to their MCU counterparts. There’s even a few references to more obscure elements of Marvel that the eagle-eyed will appreciate (“Was that a reference to Doppelganger of all characters?”).

This is important because a lot of your downtime between battles will be spent hanging out with the various Heroes, building up Friendship (Which improves their combat abilities), attending club activities (Yes, Blade the vampire hunter starts a Book Club.), buying new outfits for your Hunter and the team (Any fan of character creators will not be disappointed here!), and exploring your home base to solve various puzzles and brew items you can later use in combat. There’s a surprising amount to do, and I found myself enjoying the hangout events and various out-of-battle content just as much as I enjoyed the action-oriented parts.

My issues with the game were mostly technical. The game has moments of weird pauses and bad pathfinding, and it comes with an incredibly annoying launcher (That can thankfully be disabled fairly easily). It also has an annoying habit of bringing up tutorials over and over again: Do I really need to know how these mission types work when I’ve done them twenty times by now?

The good far outweighs the bad though, and Midnight Suns is both an excellent strategy game and an excellent Marvel game.

Lots of upgrades and collectibles scattered throughout the game to keep you busy.

You can see all the influences from X-COM, which are games I really like, but everything is watered down.
Research - Everything is one day to complete, lots of projects have odd pre-reqs and a good portion of the projects, I didn't give two shits about.  Some of them, however, are amazingly useful.  All over the place.
""Base Building"" - From said research, it all costs the magic coins.  Again, some upgrades are way more important than others.  It definitely unlocks some cool options with regards to the card abilities.
Upgrades - I do like the card based system in this game.  It's kind of like Slay the Spire (or one of the many others).  Unlocking new abilities was one of the driving forces for me.  It kept me playing a variety of different heroes.  I didn't love the card pack opening system, would have liked more control.
Teamwork/Friendship - Oh boy, superhero dating sim.  In X-COM, soldiers who do a lot of missions together form bonds that offer powers.  I could take it or leave it in that game.  In this game, it's like Mass Effect without the banging.  I find that mechanic makes more sense when it's a smaller team.  When it's a dozen or more people, it starts feeling weird.  The powers you unlock through this system are really nice, so you kind of have to put up with it.
Missions - In X-COM, bad shit was happening and you needed to do something about it.  There was a threat level to manage and often your mission choice had other impacts like ongoing events.  In MS, I never really felt like these were threats.  It was just what kind of reward do you want.  I know one of the missions will give credits/artifact/essences/intel, so I just pick the one I want more at the time.  Boy the apocalypse took it's sweet time to happen, all the major story points just wait around for you to pick them.  There probably should have been a penalty, however minor, for not doing story missions.
Combat - Every mission is basically an arena.  There's not a lot of ""tactics"" involved.  It mostly devolves into smash the enemy as efficiently as possible.  Almost all of the mission types involve playing a special card to do a thing, so you have less card plays.  There are a few exceptions, but none of them terribly interesting.  The environmental attacks are fun, and you need some positioning to pull off big moves, but overall it's very samey.  The card based system is passable, but you can get dealt some total garbage hands at times.  The redraws are there to mitigate it, but that won't always save you.  Overall, I liked it more than not.
Other - ingredients, chests, color swaps on suits.  Meh.  Exploring the Abbey grounds was kind of interesting,  Looking for plants wasn't a lot of fun.  I didn't use the cauldron very much, but it has it's uses.  The little dots you pick up, was just like why, what a weird thing to include.

This game is definitely more story forward than X-COM.  They really want you to care about the plot.  It also involves 1000% more whiny babies.  The whole thing is like a soap opera, trying to manufacture these little dramas with different characters.  These characters aren't getting along, they'll make up.  This superhero has some anxiety, they will get over it.  At times, it's like babysitting.  Other times it's like being in high school.  It does give you a little bit of insight into who these characters are, especially if you don't know them already, but overall it didn't do much for me.  This is also the main reason I'm unlikely to play through again.  I know the plot, I've seen the unlocks, the missions are samey, there's not a lot to go back for.  That being said, if they made another game in this line, perhaps focused around the X-Men, I would totally be down.",1677353216,1677353216,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately when the game shipped, while there is a tactical Deck builder game there, it's buried underneath the rest of the game which is, at least for me, not really enjoyable.

I've played this game ~65 hours as of this writing, and I will probably keep playing it since I spent so much on it. But if I knew what I know now, I never would have purchased it.

Pros: 
Great card options, as well as ways to modify card, enhance them, and smash up decks from different characters for different play styles.
Great costumes on all the characters.
Nice scenery and objects throughout the levels and base.
Solid voice acting all around.

Cons: Endless wandering around a poorly mapped ""home base"" to collect badly marked ingredients and collectables.
While the costumes are fantastic, the actual human models and faces are horribly outdated. the ""main character"" everyman type looks like they bought a G3M character from Daz a decade ago and decided not to customise it.
The tactical aspect of battles is almost, but not quite, totally meaningless. Position on the battlefield is taken care of by the game for the most part with every spell.
Battle Dialog: No matter what sort of battle you're in, the game talks as if you're battling the Hydra goons from the very beginning. Just turn it off, silence is much better.
Despite a couple patches there are still glitches in the game, though they do seem to have eliminated all the game breaking ones, there are problems with the game telling there are things to do when there aren't, Or making you re-talk to someone to clear alerts.

I really want to like this game, and not just because of how much it cost, but it simply fails in so many different small ways that add up to disappointment.

I find I have to FORCE myself to load it up and play though it, while so many other games I eagerly load up on reflex.

I'm not sure who should buy this game.. but it's certainly not worth the stupid price I paid for pre-release + season pass.  Deep discount only, I don't think a lot of these problems are solvable, they're too much a part of the base game.

So, why the thumbs down from me? 

Two critical flaws:

Flaw 1: DeNuvo ""anti-tamper"" - Like other DRM measures before it, it's a forced piece of malware that you are required to install on your computer. Malware? You ask? Malware, verifiable malware. Just because a software isn't a virus or seem like it causes performance issues don't mean that it's not malware, PUPs (like DeNuvo) are considered malware too. Why? It's software you're forced to install for malicious reasons. Its purpose on your PC is not there for your benefit. It's only reason for existing on your computer is to prove that you, a customer who bought this game here on Steam legitimately with your own money, are not stealing the game which you bought with your own money through a vendor which installs games by taking money from the bank account or money payment site you have listed and they, Steam, have authenticated. This software continuously runs to prove to the actual customer of the 3rd party malware that is DeNuvo's only concern in their point to point contracts that you, a paying customer who spent the money that you accrued and Steam verified by collecting those funds from you are not what they deem a criminal by continuously forcing your computer that you bought with your hard earned money or even stole, is not stealing the game from their paying customer, in this case, Firaxis and 2k games. You are not the customer to DeNuvo, and so they are not incentivized to: a. tell you the  truth about what their malware does to your machine. b. care that your machine will be affected by their malware. Their only contractual obligation is to prove to their actual customer, Firaxis and 2k games, that you the person who decided to buy the game legitimately continuously didn't steal the product that you, the person whom bought the game legitimately or with stolen money from Steam and nothing more. This cycle is run the entirety of the time you fire up the game. This occurs continuously as long as DeNuvo is on your system, and this will continue for an amount of time that is agreed for by a very expensive contract that their actual customer, the game publisher, either decides to pay them another large sum of money, or if they decide to not renew the contract... what this means is that it's automatically assumed that you, the person who paid a not small amount of money, are a thief, but, does not care if money is legitimately collected by steam, even if you accrued that money by illicit gains. Money is all that matters in this case, and you are treated as an automatic hostile party that the game publisher ""needs protection from in case you turn out to be a crook"" by forcing your pc to have this malware installed on it... and no, I'm not saying that you'll definitely see performance related issues from it being forced to run every time you fire up your computer. It might actually not, but, that's also a lie too. Sure, the main performance offender is 2k's crappy launcher that you have to bypass by adding a %command% line to the shortcut of the game, but the issue is the vulnerability that is being forced onto your computer because either company fails to realize that this is not the way to stop pirates (or people using cheat engine to gate in-game 'premium' currency which is not a good reason as that monetization was stopped, therefore posing even less of a reason this malware should be on your machine, especially since VAC is suffice enough). So, then, what does DeNuvo do while it's on your PC? It sits there, it fires up whenever you turn your computer ON A KERNEL LEVEL and IN A WAY THAT IS CLASSIFIED LEGITIMATELY AS A ROOTKIT on the off chance that you MIGHT decide to open Steam and run the game. It doesn't care if it does or does not cause general peformance issues to you or force your computer to run harder than it otherwise would. H3ll, it doesn't even care that its processes are intentionally hidden from task manager which means that you have no control over a process that's installed on your computer. All that malware decides to care about is whether its paying customer, the publisher, who did NOT buy your computer and did NOT buy the game that you were sold is satisfied that you, the person who bought the game or stole a computer or scammed a CD Key with Steam, did NOT ""steal the game"" on a moment by moment basis. Take a look at DeNuvo's customer agreement some time and realize that that agreement is not considering you as the customer, but the threat. 

2. The script basically makes you a Mary Sue in the Marvel Universe... I'm sorry , what? a Mary Sue in the Marvel Universe? Isn't that the job of Captain America? Yeah... your characters first lines are essentially a Mary Sue fantasy.... your character is the ""chosen one"" who will ""save the entirety of the Marvel Universe"" from ""that horrible threat that is the deity known in mythology as Lilith whom is not a demon despite being portrayed as one""... Honestly, they could've put in any generic BBEG and, well the Mary Sue stuff is extreme cringe. It seems like the writers decided to write a TTRPG campaign based off inspiration from browsing the most cringest stories from r/RPGHorrorStories and thought ""Oh, yeah, those aren't horror stories, wtf are they even talking about? That's thematic and theatrical BRILLIANCE."": a. You are the chosen one who was born from Lilith and who can destroy Lilith. b. Because your character was put in a tomb to be awoken when Liltih is summoned again; you are automatically treated by characters that, in the comics, are the most skeptical and cynical characters in terms of if even their allies are actually 'good', as if you've done some things that make you the only actual 'good guy' and them ""powerless"". The lines for your character are just as bad. Seriously... I mean, one of the reasons I bought this game is because I thought to myself, ""Oh, cool, all the most cynical and gritty characters in the franchise aside from the Punisher are in the lineup, there's no way that they'd Mary Sue the PC, especially not at first."" OH no, that's exactly what they (and the game) do. I don't usually care if the narrative threads are shaky, some of my favorite games have SOME predictable tropes like that. I mean, Mass Effect has the MC as a ""chosen one"", yet in both settings you're not automatically ""perfect"" and there are believable story threads, and it's implied that you'll fail, are flawed and will not be by default 'good'. Yet, in this game, not only are the lines of the Main Character, The Hunter, so cringe that I'm constipated by proxy, but, they sound forced like a robot was trying to act like a person and failed to learn what things to pronounce in what way, I say ""sounds like"" because I work with AI who use Voice packs, and even though their evolution never included ears, a mouth or vocal cords, that AI I work with would be way better at reading the lines. 

I'm not saying that having a power fantasy occur in a Marvel setting is inherently bad, but, the PC is treated as the expert, they automatically know the plot without any sorts of dialog, and they know that they are the chosen one and are treated as such from the very beginning by the likes of Tony Stark and Blade, some of the most cynical and critically minded characters in the franchise. All because what? Your character was raised from the dead and is claimed to have been ""the chosen one"". If this was a Captain America game, it'd work, it's not, the line up is filled with anti-hero's, it's so cringe I had to stop the game just to warn: ""Brace yourselves, it's a Mary-Sue simulator with malware."" Do I say don't buy? No, but as long as DeNuvo is in the game, modders can't pay some Fiverr actor/actress $5 to narrate the lines better, nor could I mod in Microsoft Steve to read the lines, so, it means playing the game with voice over muted...",1677336472,1677336472,False,6,3,0.554718613624572754,0,True,False,False

The combat system is great. When the game was announced I thought it's basically going to be XCOM but with superheroes but they made something really special with the combat. For people who enjoy turn based combat, it's awesome!

The problem is the other part of the game where you socialize with the other superheroes, the dialogs are bland, boring and cringe most of the time...like a CW after school special. Plus you have to run around a maze like abbey and collect a bunch of crap and it feels like a chore and not a recreational activity, screw that.
Dragon Age Origins did something similar where you have a ""camp"" and you speak and socialize with your party members but it was done the right way. When you speak with your companions you get to discover lore about the world, build character for them(some dialog choices can affect their personalities), engage in quests, get bonuses for them(depends on your relationship) and the humor is not cringe(most of the time).

It just feels like the dev showed lots of love to the combat and gave zero attention to the writing...it's terrible. The voice acting is good tho.

I can't speak about the DLCs yet because I played only one mission with Deadpool and thats about it.

I am going to recommend the game purely based on the great combat system, the rest is mediocre minus at best.

Midnight Suns is a one-of-a-kind experience that mishmashes several genres while perfecting its craft in each of them. You gotta try this out - I think you need to try it for yourself!",1677303701,1677303701,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The card system works super well and is very engaging and thought provoking. Often the combats feel like puzzles to solve instead of relying on a ton of variance as is typical in the XCOM series. I cannot overstate how much I enjoy the combat aspect in this game.

Everything else however is quite a mixed bag. The writing is rather mediocre, there's a laundry list of chores you need to do every day after every mission (go open your booster pack, open your other reward, do training, see if anyone has a thing you need to do for them, go to LIMBO for training, etc) before you get to jump into the next mission. I enjoy the injury system, but I wish the game was more punishing at higher difficulties with heroes getting fatigued so you'd be even more encouraged to keep cycling your roster around other than for your own enjoyment.

The lack of an actual doomsday clock in this game is also rather boring in my experience. The story tries to hype you up to the apocalyptic threat you're facing but you're really free to do as many missions as you want in-between story missions. I understand some people are off put by the timer, so have it as an option instead of just turning it off for the rest of us. Or maybe tie it into the difficulty.

The DLC seems not overly insulting in the price, especially if you just pickup the 'legendary edition' with how often the game's on sale these days.

Overall I do enjoy the game, but I wish all the side content didn't feel so painful to slog through. I find myself skipping most non-cutscene dialog for my own sake. If you can pick it up during a sale it's totally worth if you enjoy strategy games, at full price its a bit much to ask in my opinion.",1677291888,1677291888,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The tactics side doesn't feel as deep as something like XCOM, but it's still really fun, and at max difficulty I quite frequently find myself just barely making it through a mission, with every choice both before and during the fight feeling appropriately important.

However, I consider the real selling-point here being the social aspect. Think something like Fire Emblem, where over time you'll get to know a cast of interesting characters, and hopefully, if the writing clicks with you, start to care about their stories. Despite this being a licensed Marvel game, my favourite characters were ones I had absolutely no connection to, such as Magik and Nico. I had never heard about them before, but as a result of this game, I'm looking forward to checking out their comics. Bear in mind that if you're not interested at all in that part of the game, you're likely going to be disappointed by Midnight Suns. While it seems to be technically possible to avoid most of the conversations, the average playthrough will be nearly equal parts conversation and tactics combat. If one or the other isn't your cup of tea, the experience will be frustrating.

That being said, my only real criticisms are related to stuttering and the dlc pricing. The stuttering seems to be completely caused by the 2K launcher, and it is easily bypassed through Steam launch options. A quick search for ""midnight suns stuttering fix"" should give you all the information required to fix it, but that players have to do that in the first place is inexcusable. Regarding the dlc, they seem to be ridiculously overpriced. At the time of writing only two have been released, being Deadpool and Venom. I've only had the opportunity to try Deadpool's so far, and while the missions were overall enjoyable, and Deadpool himself is a lot of fun to play, it definitely isn't worth a fourth of the overall game price.

*Old review below*

Buyers beware, the game is horribly optimized and often crashes. 

Pros:
1. Characters feel unique in their playstyles, and feel rather true to form
2. Combat animations for your characters look impressive, and are generally short enough not to feel too repetitive
3. Each round of combat brings new variable, forcing you to think on your feet. The game feels like x-com, but from the perspective of the chosen.

Cons:
1. The game is designed like a typical pay to win mobile game, with lots of different resource types often roadblocking your progression, this can become frustrating later in the game. 
2. Enemy combat animations are simple looking and take a while to play out, making the enemy turns, especially in the late game, slightly annoying to wait through
3. Depending on your luck, you may end up with unsolvable puzzles (example: duplicate glyph in the standing stone puzzle sequence)
4. The game suffers from performance issues, but launching without the 2k launcher seems to alleviate most of the problem.
5. The game crashes often, my last crash was during the abbey exploration phase of the game, losing me about an hour of effort.

Recommendation:
1. Wait for a sale, and hopefully the bugs and performance issues will also be fixed by then.
2. If you wish to play the game now, minimize your engagement with the abbey exploration part of the game, instead focus on combat missions.",1670140209,1677236314,True,0,0,0.526875734329223633,1,True,False,False

Overall the setting is fun and has a cool goth/magic feel and Marvel's A list of Superheroes is a treat for comic book nerds like me. 

Now the bad, bugs. Missions spawn without required elements, such as chests that require keys acquired by knocking out enemies, but none of the enemies have the keys. Missions that crash halfway through, etc. It is very frustrating when you are deep in a mission and have to abandon it to never return because it is just broken.  Also the graphics are decent, but on a fairly beefy setup, Geforce GTX 1080  they are scaled back and for a turn based game could use some optimization.

The combat is not so easy, some are comparing this game to Xcom games and at some point they are right but it has so much more to give you as a player, from the small fighting area to the cards you must use very smart to win the battle or to complete some hard challenges.

The games greatest strength and biggest weakness is how it ties all of these sections together.

I was hesitant to pick it up at first because I'm not always a fan of card based systems, nor am I a huge Marvel fan. In the beginning, I was struggling with the idea of only 3 card plays per turn and how to maximize my effectiveness without losing heroes. I was surprised by the non-combat component of the game and the abbey grounds exploration. After a few upgrades and finishing dozens of missions, I can say that while it's different, it's good.

I still am not a huge fan of the abbey exploration bit and collecting essence resources specifically, but it's less intrusive as it was when I first started and now the combat feels like a puzzle to solve with each fight (in a good way).

What surprised me most was the level of story and my engagement and feelings towards both the story and the characters. It's really enjoyable. I find myself struggling to decide to push the story forward or work on side missions to boost abilities and level up characters. I want to know where the story goes next. I want to know what happens to X character. 

If you're on the fence, give it a shot. I grabbed the ultimate version on sale for $60 and feel it was worth it (the base game was $35 at the time, which is more than worth it).

I didn't give this game an initial look because I loathe the Marvel movie franchise.  After hearing that the gameplay is Slay The Spire and X-Com, I got interested and decided to pick it up.  

The combat missions are the main attraction for me.  There is a big variety of enemy type, and plenty of different ways to attack them.  Combat looks awesome, the moves looks devastating, and it never gets old chucking low level flunkies around the map and causing destruction.

In between missions you get all your loot and baubles and decide how you want to upgrade your cards, what missing items you want to craft, what passives you watch to research, and who you want to work on your Friendship with, which causes even more bonuses for combat.

There is an ""Exploration"" aspect that is allright, it can be totally skipped, but if you do the exploration you can get your Friendship levels up faster, and get your cosmetic upgrades quicker.  There are a TON of cosmetics.

Whatever team was behind the gameplay and balance did a tremendous job, and if you are a fan of tactical rpgs or card battlers, this is a MUST play.

The story and dialog are.... very cringy.  But in a wholesome way, not in an offensive way.  There's no activism, no morale lecturing, no Current Thing.

The pure strategic aspect is good. not perfect, Xcom games have a better ones but still, you can do quite some stuffs in this one.
The card game aspect is quite fun to. enjoy a lot building a deck for each character who plays really differently from one to another. to bad though we got way to few cards for every characters (around 12 cards only per characters for a 8 deck cards ... only the main character got way more cards but well...).
The story is quite good, one of the few game I enjoy watching every cinematics and reading characters dialogue so I can learn more about them.
Yes there is a lot of reading but you can skip everything if you want so not really a problem.
Finally one of the strongest aspect of the game I think: the replayability is REALLY good. new game + with way enough difficulty mode, and with perfect characters progression and important stuff carrying over each playthrough.
the game is decently optimized (not the best though) but on some missions (especially the last one of the story) you might have some HUGE fps drop (and I have a mid to high end PC).

Performance issues aside (and they DO need to be fixed, it's shameful to have the game still suffering this long into release), Midnight Suns might be one of my very favourite games that I have ever played. It ticks a lot of boxes; Engaging, tactical combat that doesn't get bogged down and still feels cool. Character customisation with a protagonist that has actual personality, while still allowing for choice. Excellent story and characterisation. My favourite part is how it humanises the heroes and allows you to develop friendships with them.

Marvel Midnight Suns delivers pretty much everything it promises. 

The point of the game is a mix of strategy, card building, super hero friendships, with a fun comic story behind it.
Lets first start with the card-game part. Many seeing Firaxis behind the studio (and Jake Solomon) will assume its a X-Com game, but it is not. It is its own thing. The cards honestly make the game better because how better they work to showcase say, Tony Stark full bursting his entire arsenal on enemies, or Blade making enemies bleed with his sword and then staking them with his powers.

More over, its not x-com in the same sense that none of your character but Hunter, are made. There is no randomization, you have Nico Minoru on your team, she is a Runaway, she has plenty of background, and a character arc. There is very little emergent narratives with the characters.

But is the combat good? YES. Its damn fun to play, and it always make me want to play more. Your ""deck"" is essentially 8 cards that make a super hand between three heroes you choose, so the mix can sometimes favour one hero compared to another. Keeping sinergy between heroes is important when bringing them into missions. 

More over you will hunt cards to improve some, and also to find cards with certain conditions that can make them better. For instance, any card that gets the ""Free"" as a bonus ability already makes it phenomenally powerful. You see, in game you are limited 3 actions per turn, so finding ways to deal with the action economy in this game is part of the strategy and fun (bring Doctor Strange to deal with it with a few of his cards though).

With a combination of using the enviroment to cause damage to enemies, the whole game has a really fun system that just makes you want to play more and more. Firaxis didn't make X-Com alone, they also have Civilization games on their roster, and Midnight Suns showcase once again how skillful they are at crafting strategy games.

The second part of the Midnight Suns that seems to bring a bit more of problem is the ""Abbey"" parts. This is your social links, your confidants, your moment in the Normandy to talk to your companions. This is also the chance for any Marvel fanboy (like myself) to get have my own OC talk and get close to Marvel superheroes.
While I agree that sometimes the writing can get bit too much, there is plenty of good emotional stuff there (Cap is champion of wholesomeness), and good moments. Hell, they made Captain Marvel very likable in this game, a character that always had so much vitrol attached to her, but both the writers and the VO Erica Lindbeck sold her mix of seriousness and sweet moments quite well.

The Abbey honestly will not be every strategy game cup of tea, but you can do it in around 3 to 4 minutes, skip dialogue, and bam go straight to the table for more missions. Mind you, that having level 5 friendship is required to get the best card for each character, so do try to compensate with hang-outs and gifts.

To Marvel fans - the story is really well sold. Why is everyone following your character? First, because they accomplished the mission before, more over instead of having the Avengers solving every problem, the Midnight Suns are the ""supernatural team"" that per speciallity can deal with the problems they are facing better. All the heroes have their backgrounds well explored, their intereractions to feel very friendly between them, and each ""club"" is its own fun moment that makes sense.

And after years of messy games that don't come complete, have lackluster problems, and predatory monetization, I was profoundly surprised that the game came with so much that you can get it straight by playing. You don't have to buy the ""Coils"" who are essentially the boosters cards for the game, those you earn after missions. Skins? Yes, there are a few on sale, but most of the are acquired through the gameplay, specially the gold, black Midnight Sun skins for each hero.

Honestly, its a fun game that deliver what it promises, and have a good start and finish to its story.

It's a little rough around the edges, most notably that you currently cannot pause cutscenes.  With the game missions being turn based, it's that one flaw away from being a game you can easily step away from to answer the door, take a bio break, or actually interact with your family.

That minor annoyance aside, I'm having so much FUN with it.  The writing is good enough to find your favorite characters familiar.  The combat system gives you reasons to think and plan and chain actions together.  The difficulty can slide if you find yourself struggling or winning too easily.

I enjoy the pacing of having a breather to explore and socialize between missions.  The relationship system is nuanced enough to have you thinking about the personality of the person you're talking to before making choices, and over time the conversations you have affect your own balance.  The ""heroic"" answer is not always the one you need.

It’s a turn based, squad building, game with an excellent deck building element for combat that is surprisingly good at delivering immersive superhero action. I didn’t think it would work but it does. It’s satisfying, tactical and rewarding and I keep coming back for more.

In between missions you are in a hub (The Abbey) where you can play the optional companion-friendship game and optional exploration game. The key word here is optional. I personally love it. The characters are well realized and the voice actors do a fantastic job of bringing the Marvel universe to life.

Also, I was so happy to finally have a Marvel game where I could make my own character. You play as your own customized character “The Hunter”, with dialogue choices that affect your relationships. You build them in character creation like you would other RPGs. In combat, The Hunter is one of many team members you can choose to bring along for a mission. Because they are well-acted, detailed and a highly competent addition to the roster, it feels good to constantly include them in missions as your avatar.

I’ve immensely enjoyed all elements of the game. If you’re on the fence, I encourage you to keep an open mind and try this one. It’s one of those games that would’ve benefited from a demo. Once you play it, you’ll know what I mean.

Be aware there are cosmetic microtransactions: Yes they are there, no you don’t need to engage with them in any way. They are purely cosmetic. In my case I bought the edition with all the costumes so the transactions haven’t featured at all in my play.

It has the superficial appearance of being a game with a lot of microtransactions, but honestly it hasn't pushed any of that and I haven't had any moments where I felt like I it was trying to sell me something. I did end up buying the legendary version for the future DLC, but it was mostly just because I liked the game enough after 30 hours that I knew I'd put a lot more time into it. Why not reward the studio for doing a great job?

I was wary of the 'card game' style since I'm not usually a fan of these types of games, but I decided to take a chance on the free weekend and as it turns out it's actually a pretty deep little RPG/XCOM/Card hybrid that works pretty well.

I put a ton of hours into XCOM and XCOM2, and while it took me a minute to get used to all the various systems once I did the game turned out to be a blast. You can customize each characters 'decks' which are then drawn each turn in combat, and each character feels unique and brings something interesting to the table.

The big sell, at least for me, is that it doesn't seem to have any of the timed nonsense from the XCOM games and you can just keep playing missions forever while taking your time with any story missions that actually move the game forward. You earn upgrade materials for each mission, and you choose missions that give rewards that you're lacking much like the 'side missions' in the XCOM series. 

The combat maps are a little small, even if some of them have multiple fights that move between set pieces. It's more like Chimera Squad than XCOM2 in that sense, but ultimately I liked Chimera Squad for what it was so it's not a huge negative here.

There's also different times of day when you can accomplish different RPG/story goals. During the nights you can explore the grounds of the abby, which is fairly large, and you end up collecting items that you use to craft or upgrade various things. Personally, that's probably the worst part since after a few times of running around the grounds it gets a bit tedious.

Ultimately this is probably the best turn-based tactics game that I've played since XCOM2. I'm really looking forward to learning the systems better so I can crank up the difficulty past 'normal'. The normal setting is getting a little easy, although every once in a while it still surprises me with a boss in a standard mission and someone goes down.

Before I dive in on this review I'm gonna throw 2k under the bus for this. The optimization is terrible and having in game purchases on a singleplayer game is atrocious. THEY MAKE YOU PAY FOR THE DEMON SKINS SCARLET WITCH AND HULK HAVE THAT ARE IN THE FUCKING GAME TO BEGIN WITH.  It ran better before the update. Went from all epic to medium just to get through the last bit of the game without tanking my FPS. 

[h1] Story [/h1]
You are the Hunter. A centuries old hero brought back from the dead to stop a prophecy just as old as you. Your goal: stop your mother Lilith from making the prophecy a reality once again. I was not familiar with the Midnight Suns prior to this game. But man what an incredible story from start to finish. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
When I first heard that this game's combat was going to be run through a card system I lost so much hope. It sounded absolutely terrible. I decided I'd buy and try it because I'm a superhero lover and boy was I happily surprised. I was hooked immediately. The card system adds a new layer of strategy and unlike XCOM...a more manageable and less rage inducing RNG system. Not counting the planned DLC added heroes, you get a ton of heroes to fight with and work with. All of them are a ton of fun to play as. Knocking enemies into objects, other enemies and your teammates for extra damage is very satisfying. Boss battles are intense. Animations and effects are beautiful and I never get sick of watching them. The relationship system is also fun and adds to future combat scenarios while simultaneously allowing you to get to know each and every hero personally. The exploration portion of the game...is a bit lackluster. Not awful but tedious towards the third and final act. Despite the shitty decisions 2K has made there is a ton of customization options throughout the game and even more after you beat the game. There's a ton of content.

[h1] Graphics and Sound [/h1]
Like I said before, animations are pretty and you really never get sick of them. This isn't the most graphically impressive game but it still looks good. It'd look even better if it didn't force the 2K launcher on you and the devs actually cared to fix the optimization. The sound is very well done. Nice and crisp. Bass has the perfect amount of boom. 

[h1] Overall [/h1]
The game is fantastic and is arguably one of the best Marvel games ever made. Customization is extensive even without the shitty and greedy decisions 2K made locking skins behind paywalls in a singleplayer game. I'm also pretty certain 2K ripped content out of the base game to re-sell to us as DLC because the DLC is coming out suspiciously close to one another. I look forward to playing them but I'm definitely waiting for a good sale. Do I recommend the game? Yes. Wholeheartedly. Once 2K polishes and patches the game up and inevitably sells the complete package with all DLC and skins unlocked.

The missions work like puzzles -- the more optimal the completion, the more rewards you receive. In that sense, there is a sort of ""Escape the Breach"" aesthetic in how you beat your enemies down.

The story is good, the characters and cast are good. However, I wish the Abbey was done better. The area is far too large to constantly be rechecking the same are for herbs (for the witch club -memory storyline, as well as crafting items for battle). It also really causes the NPC sections to drag out, as you are having to hoof it to every spot that the NPCs are at.

Additionally, this large area has weird collision on thing cluttering the ground. The Abbey area is quite open, but there are tons of rocks, and inexplicable invisible walls. Some spots you  can harmless fall off of, others will not let you fall. There isn't any logic to the exploration, and it is frustrating just trying to get around everywhere. It's like the developers just needed to run a sander over every edge on the map to smooth over the walking.

One thing that helps this a bit is that there are fast travel locations for each section of the Abbey -- except the central one. Like I said, the Abbey pacing really slows down your entry into the missions. I don't mind the character beats, but there is filler time in just running about this complex.

Although I'm only ~5 hours in I'm writing the review now because I don't know how much more if at all I'll play it.  Here's why:

-About half the game seems to consist of walking around the home base and talking to NPCs.  It has a strong RPG component that is much more reminiscent of say the older EA fantasy/sci-fi games.  That's not a problem in and of itself (I loved those games); the problem is that the RPG component is very poorly executed.  The writing is flat, the characters are boring, and the story so far is pretty thin.  It doesn't help that the character models are like wooden dolls.  Worse than Mass Effect: Andromeda, which triggered a backlash in the community and a quick patch/fix by EA.  And that was years ago.  Just really unforgivably bad in 2022.

-I am running Intel i7-9700 and NVIDIA RTX 2060, which far exceeds the recommended spec, and yet the game constantly stutters and freezes on ""high"" (not highest) performance.  Load times are lengthy.  I have ray tracing turned off as some have recommended and it doesn't help.  There is a lengthy guide to bypassing the 2K launcher, but why should anyone have to do that to get a game to work properly?  If the launcher doesn't work, don't make us use it.  And frankly the graphics just aren't that great even on ""high"" and given their mediocrity there's just no excuse for this kind of performance.

-And now to the ""action""--boring as all hell.  The card-based power system is about as complicated and interesting from a strategy perspective as a turn-based RPG.  Pick power, use it, possibly stack with something else, see effects.  Because powers always ""hit"" (there is no randomization) you're not playing/calculating odds against costs.  Again, nothing wrong with being a turn-based RPG--but this game is incredibly badly executed as-such.  The fights happen in tiny arenas; positioning and movement are virtually irrelevant; and the card system makes the combat stilted and slow rather than free-flowing.  In other words, it *feels* like a strategy game, but has the complexity of an RPG, and hence is, once again, boring.

I am not knocking this game because it tries to have both strategy and RPG elements.  Nothing wrong with that.  I'm knocking it because it does RPG badly and also does strategy badly.  It does nothing well.  And hence I strongly recommend avoiding it.

EDIT.  Against my better judgment (at the time) I finished the game.  The dialogue never really gets any better and the story makes zero sense.  There is a lot *less* dialogue as the game progresses, which is a good thing, and you can just skip through it if you want.  The combat does get moderately interesting by the end and I enjoyed messing around with different builds for different heroes.  I started a new game+ and was immediately reminded of just how awfully slow the first couple hours are, with piles of badly written cut scenes.  I still can't recommend this game.",1672626473,1676940752,False,0,0,0.472972989082336426,0,True,False,False

The combat mechanics are solid, the voice talent did a great job portraying these characters, and this game got me into the, ""just one more mission"" mindset. 

The combat mechanics took a while to get used to, but once I got into the flow it was a blast to synergize blade with Deadpool and Iron man, manipulating the field and turn a situation from, ""this looks bad"" to ""where did the baddies go??""

The out of combat stuff seems a little rushed, and could have used more polish. There are friendship mechanics that are ok, you have to gather and explore the abbey, but crafting is meh, the puzzles are ok, th environments are nice, but I would have been ok if I didn't explore the Abbey at all.

The research and hero ops missions all taking one day to complete, but they have requirements, along with the no pressure to get things done timely, leads to these mechanics working solo as opposed to XCOM, where they seem to flow together. 

The writing is ok, if you like Marvel characters and plots, it is one of those. Same with the characters. They also forced a new kids versus old heads plot that I never really felt the tension. They were angry because they said they were angry.

 I was also irritated that I could only bring three members on a mission, with the ""new protagonist"" being one of the three on story missions. The cast is 12 heroes before you include the DLC. The map sizes work best with three, but why did we get 4 Midnight Suns, half of the Avengers, Spiderman and Wolverine on the same team if we can't bring a larger number on a mission.

If you're looking for an introduction to the XCom style of game, then this is definitely the game to start on. 

There isn't a chance you're going to miss hitting an enemy with a 98% chance to hit (Looking at you XCom.) and the only real random part of combat is the card draw, which still isn't that bad. So maybe you wind up using Blade exclusively for cards for three turns in a row because that's how you got the cards, but your other characters can still do things through environmental attacks and movement attacks. 

The dialogue is a little bit... flat at times. Now, I'm unsure if that's because I'm not familiar with the Midnight Suns (Blade, Ghost Rider, Nico, Magik, Scarlett Witch) and so I'm not super aware of their stories, but Dr. Strange, Tony Stark, Captain America? The quips, the dialogue, it all hits super accurate for me. Hell, this game has even turned me around on Captain Marvel, which I wasn't expecting. 

My only criticism of the game is the visual controls while in combat. I would like a better top down or zoomed out visual, but that's not stopping me from playing the game. 

Until I was able to upgrade my PC, I ran this game on low graphics, and it still worked fantastically. And since I got the new graphics card and put it all up to epic, it's just as smooth and just as perfect. I haven't beaten the game at the time of writing this, but there's a part of me that doesn't want to. I just want more and more missions. It's great.

UPDATE AT 147.2 hours:

I beat the game. Started NG+ did the Deadpool DLC on it, realized it was glitched, and then started a new game once the glitch got fixed! Currently down 5 achievements but that's because they're for Venom who's coming next. 

The ending was great, and really loops well for NG+ and further. I am impressed and in love with this game, which was what I expected out of a Firaxis product because I LOVED XCom 1&2.

[Long-ish review without spoilers]

I like turn-based combat, and after a few fights you learn how to read the cards and strategize. Some new mechanics are added throughout to keep you on your toes and having you adapt to the new conditions or objectives. Also yeeting a crate in a goon's face never stops being amusing for me lmao. Although taking too long to finish a mission does make things hard and a bit tedious. Overall though, taking into account my love for turn-based combat and my faint liking for cards combat, I do enjoy the gameplay. Although in some long fights I'd like to speed up the animations: they are beautiful, but some are quite long.

A BIG part of the game is interacting with the characters. Yes, sometimes the dialogue is cringey and the interpersonal conflict feels forced unless you really psychoanalyze the characters' many issues, the stressful situations and sprinkle in a LOT of teen angst (that part, I do not like. I won't make it a secret that I hate Minoru and Magik here.). However, it's enjoyable to talk with the more mature characters, discuss their insecurities, and help them through it. The voice actors did their best, which is clearest when the characters are angry or distraught imo, but were let down by the lack of body language and most facial expressions. To skip those ""static"" scenes you need to skip line by line. If it's a more cinematic scene, hold the button.

There's a lot of optional stuff. You can explore the HQ place (it's BIG), find backstory and lore, interact with every hero you gather, become friends with them, participate in group events. The exploring and the friendship give some aesthetic choices but also useful materials, items and passive character abilities that will help in fights.",1676931196,1676931196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

not my complaints while a few and mean are only here to tell firaxes to not ignore these in a patch or game 2

HOWEVER  you made 1 huge error i do demand you beg for forgivness on, spider-man sucks..... how could you!? 

let me explain i agree with most that this game punishes you if you dont clear out a wave or keep it mostly clear. this leads to issues like Tanks are kinda pointless, sept are boy wolverine hes solid tank with nukes, Blade the vampire hunter being the worse pick for vampire missions due to bleed status effect sucking and vamps debuff when hitting you sucking more, and spider-man as you might guess while he has decent minion clearing he has no real punch and others can clear minions better/ effictive. Also along this method Hunter , you, is strong yes but light hunter is spider-man strong, dark hunter is world breaker hulk strong...

so if i take hunter with iron man.. ok those two are all you need honestly, and add strange for stupid support or deadpool, nico, or magik i can wipe the floor with each wave or kill the guys garding the target and take it round one why bring a tank at all i need to stop something from getting a way or spawning to many guys.

rant is not to say you cant use spider-man or any of the tanks on normaly gameplay mabey even some hard but when i can nuke a map and handle the smaller waves i dont need tanks and healers if im not getting hit.

anyway im just upset spider-man is a drag on my team with such a cool super ablity fun game i hope they do another with these issues in mind",1676927630,1676927630,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do you love all things Marvel or just super heroes in general?
Do you like tactical/RPG games?
Do you like A LOT of depth to your characters and their stories?

If you answered yes to at least 2 of these you will enjoy this game, plain and simple, and I would recommend this game to anyone who did.
This game has a lot of love for the Marvel franchise as a whole, and it is clearly on display with how much thought went into developing each character, giving them all FULLY voiced dialogue throughout the entire game which is staggering when you actually see just how much dialogue is in this game. Some characters you will learn to love and some you will learn to hate. Combat is definitely a highlight as well, being able to launch enemies into barrels that explode killing multiple enemies at once never gets old.

All that said, this game does have some cons:
Story is weak at times, plot holes are plain to see with weak justification.
The arguing between characters definitely gets old, and is pretty unrealistic at times given what's at stake

Strong combat with deep character development and customization gets marred by repetitive cut scenes, content that feels forced and shameless cash grabs. 

Pros
- Fun card-based combat style that feels unique to each character. It was exciting to get new moves to mix into the deck and the combat environments add to the strategy.
- One hit kill enemies that keep replenishing each turn mixed in with the bigger baddies makes it feel like your small group is really keeping hordes at bay
- Tons of customization for your home base, hero and team.  
- Decent story that introduces you as a new Marvel superhero

Cons
- Exhausting. The gameplay loop starts to get tedious, cut scenes eventually start getting skipped and the limited mission choices turn into a chore after maybe 50 hours.
- Unabashed cash grabs. I don't mind DLC when it adds to the game, but forcing us to buy a season pass at the cost of an entire game without having an entire game's worth of content is lame. Gotta pay for that Marvel license somehow, I guess.

The game is visually appealing, yet muddled by some ugly textures in some specific cases, and the game has a case of ""andromeda face"" in all of the npc characters during conversations, which is a shame because I really quite like the social aspect of the game, which has been a major point of contention. I expected to very much dislike it but the characters are all so amicable that I'm already beginning to pick favorites.

I recommend this game wholesale. The combat gameplay is very, very fun, though the social aspect of the game may not be for everyone. It's just nice that Firaxis's take on these classic marvel characters is particularly joyful, given the subject matter. Superheroes are people too, and this game revels in that idea.",1676856764,1676856764,True,2,0,0.509910762310028076,0,True,False,False

There's so much story, so much to do, so much to explore, that I'm about 20 hours in and I've only done a handful of the story missions. Lilith is an interesting villain, and I'm not familiar with much of the Cthon lore, so learning through this game has been very fun.

Speaking of fun! Like with the media surrounding Guardians of the Galaxy, I love being introduced to characters I knew only a little about. Especieally when they're this well done. I knew a little about Ilyana, but all i knew about Robbie and Nico were their hero names (and that Robbie has a SOV kinda sorta). Now I love them all, I feel attached to them the same way I do the Guardians and I'm excited to see their stories unfold! More Blade is always a good thing, I've been a fan since the films and this Eric is infinitely approachable and a powerhouse on the battlefield. I love him slowly opening up to your Hunter and the others, I can't believe how real these friendships feel. They're so well-written, and I'm actually drawn more to the Suns than the familiar Avengers (with the exception of Carol). 

Combat is a blast, especially once you've gotten the hang of each character's unique playstyle. My favorites to have on a team with my Hunter are Robbie and Carol, but Magik's portal usage comes incredibly in handy and each team member plays in such a way that you can't go wrong with any of them! I love upgrading abilities and using the environment to help thin the numbers of enemies, combat never gets boring or feels slow. Sometimes it feels overwhelming, but as you level up abilities and upgrade your training area you get little actions that make the action economy feel more expansive. 

I'm addicted to this game, and I'm so, so glad I was able to get it. I'm looking forward to more DLC characters to expand my friendships and more zones of the abbey to explore! 

10/10, this is the most fun I've had with a single player game since GOTG!",1676854198,1676854198,True,1,0,0.466284066438674927,0,True,False,False

It's certainly not polished enough to the point that I expected, but the gameplay is decent, the characters are endearing and familiar, story is plausible heroes vs villains theme, pretty much sold with Wolverines appearance within the game. It's like playing a comic book which is what I was hoping for. 

Could use a blood splatter mod though, or any other mod to add extra marvel characters. 
If you liked Marvel comics and turn based tactics, then I'd say go for it. I know I'd pour 100+ hours on this gem.

For all the positives there were a few downsides. Character models are super bland and don’t match the excellent voice acting. Performance was mostly solid tho the old steam deck struggled through that last mission. My most petty complaint is how all the women characters would stand around with their arms crossed .

I would not recommend it at a price point any higher than that. If they update the game with a mode that let's you skip the non-combat elements while still gaining the rewards, I would recommend it more strongly.
Pros:
1. Combat is excellent. Almost every fight has been challenging and exciting. Once you get just a few fights under your belt you can really start customizing your team in a lot of fun ways. Each character has defined roles on the battlefield but there's enough choice in customization to not get stale.
2. If you like 80's movie references, there's at least 1 each hour.
3. You can pet the dog and the cat. I don't even like animals that much but I take every opportunity I can to pet them.

Cons:
1. More than half my game time has been running around the hub world searching for small currency pick-ups and having cheesy meaningless dialog interactions for tiny rewards. This is the only way to get some of these rewards so you really want to do them, but wow it is boring.
2. The game is written like a comic book, and it doesn't translate well from page to cutscene. I've started skipping through all but the most necessary dialog and I encourage everyone to do the same. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, there are lots of small rewards gated behind these terrible dialog scenes.
3. Numerous bugs and performance issues. Don't expect the game to look good or perform well. That said, I haven't run into anything game breaking, just annoying.",1676842394,1676842394,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It's tactical combat, card collector, visual novel, friendship sim, crafting sim, exploration game and puzzler all rolled into one, and none of it feels tacked-on.

At its heart is one hell of a story, the kind of thing Marvel comics used to make (no MCU here), a colossal crossover to tackle a world-ending threat, with your custom character at the centre of the plot.

The supporting cast is spectacular, both in voice and model. You care for them, you build relationships with them and you fight with them. A roster pulled right from the Marvel hall of fame as well as some characters I'd never heard of, besides.

The combat is engaging and interesting, the gameplay-loop fun. The between-battle parts are where the heart of the game lies, and I loved it.

It is very definitely value for money, I paid full price and didn't get the DLCs, but I felt none the worse for that. I played for 43 hours and completed about 95% of what was on offer.

Persona relationships, exploration and story for the other half.

For the comments referencing the 'cheesy' dialogue - I believe these players may be [i]comparing the dialogue in this game to the tone of the MCU rather than the comics[/i].

For the comments referencing how skins shouldn't cost real money- these are [i]all skins that came in the ultimate or gold edition[/i], so the people that have them already had to pay, you guessed it, real money for the higher game editions. It's [i]not a cash grab or money shop... It's them offering you the ability to buy the ones you want without buying the whole edition[/i] if you only want one or two. I don't think enough people that leave a bad review for this reason understand/know that these skins are part of premium, higher editions of the game.

Some personal notes: 

I do think the female voice actress for Hunter is a bit... stiff. It's obvious she's not bad, but the direction isn't my favorite. Thankfully, her combat dialogue and model are awesome enough for me to overlook it. I'll be doing a Matt Mercer male Hunter run next. Great animations, engaging gameplay both in the Abbey and on the combat field. It's as difficult as you want it to be and as customizable as you want it to be, giving you a lot of freedom to make some crazy team combos. I for one really love to gather everyone up in one spot with Magik and let them taste Ghost Rider's sexy Charger or feel the power of the gd sun with Cpt.

I spent 160 hours taking my time going through the full campaign; and at the time of this review, have not done the Deadpool DLC.  I find the game play to be challenging and interesting, though some what maddening how much it depends on getting good card pulls at the right time.  Card pulls may seem random, but when retrying failed encounters, I would pull the same cards in the same order, which felt weird to me.

I like the way the characters are fleshed out, but found it to be dialog heavy, even for me.  

Its extremely well thought out, and is fun building the character's abilities up to make them more powerful.

The game is very glitchy and riddled with visual and technical bugs. The lag when changing screens, or using Limbo is really bad.

All in all I think the game is worth playing, and I'll be interested to see if it improves with DLCs and patches. Right now its a really mediocre game.

I love this game. The best way to describe it is a mixture of Gloomhaven and Persona with a sprinkle of Hogwarts Legacy. 
I'm the completionist type, so the fact that I can grind side missions to build up whatever I want on no timer is nice. The card based battle system works well. It's not overwhelming but it does provide a lot of customization, especially when you can start combining cards and adding bonus effects. 
The friendship level feels familiar, except this time I feel no pressure to min/ max my time. I can spend as many side missions as I want farming gifts or continue on to the next day to keep training with no worries of failing the story.

To remain positive, seems like they picked several voice actors from Earth's Mightiest Heroes, or they found great sound alike.

Yes, the Firaxis launcher causes performance problems out the wazoo. Yes you should probably bypass that launcher if you want your game to run smoothly.

There are some odd bugs that seem to be your standard lots of code resulting in occasional bizarre stuff happening to you if all the conditions come together just wrong. Example I thankfully am an OCD saver because one of my saves got broken because I moved just wrong at just the wrong moment that I got stuck in the ground and could absolutely not move. And alas it was before quick travel was enabled so I was hosed. Thankfully my previous save was only 20 minutes earlier so it was mostly me just exploring the grounds.

I do find the DLC practice shady tbh but I find ALL DLC shady so I don't know how hypocritical it would be of me to bash on Firaxis for it. 

I received this game as a christmas present from family and to be honest I was not really that hyped for this game becaues of the card play system. I actually am glad I did receive this as a present though as the card play system and the deck management are actually pretty smooth and fun to use. I never ever thought I'd play one of those ""use cards to do things"" games but here I am raving about one.

I also loved the characters and getting to talk to the characters and also just sometimes hearing their sideline interactions with each other. 

Exploring the Abbey was more fun than I was expecting going in. I was expecting it to be an annoying snipe hunt but instead I genuinely enjoyed just walking around the grounds looking at things and seeing what new things were there. Props to the game devs for making me not feel annoyed at that.

I love the campaign mode and the fact it blends some of the best aspects of XCOM while taking off the time pressure of XCOM. The XCOM games absolutely work with their ""time to lose"" mode but I don't think that would have fit this game's tone as well and so I appreciated getting to just do a bunch of side quests. Especially as some of the mechanics are a little opaque despite the tutorial so you will waste some time and burn some cards you may not have wanted too. Being able to pretty reliably get them back via doing a side mission with the character you want is nice.

I love the fact that the combat system encourages being creative with how you move things, what attacks you use and when and how the terrain plays into your strategy. It reminds me of the best parts of XCOM.

Now on to the negatives.
The game has some glitches and again if I wasn't an OCD saver I would have lost my game or at least hours of my game due to some of those bugs.

Some of the dialogue doesn't actually say what you think it's going to say in a conversation which is a problem with many RPGs dating back since the dawn of RPGs.

There are absolutely performance problems thanks to the stupid launcher and it's pretty bad that my game performance improved substantially just by bypassing their launcher. 

There are some glitches were dialogue appears to be missing or the scene skips and suddenly the person is talking about something else. This happens in conversations with Scarlet Witch and Magick for me.

There are some graphics glitches when it comes to using non ""base"" skins and how they appear in cutscenes. Once or twice I had the red and gold light armor appear as a non rezzed in texture. 

The pay to get skins are actually largely inferior to the base game skins so the fact that the season bundle which I bought as soon as I was 60 hours into Midnight Suns and still having fun wasn't really that much of a selling point to me.

On a final note this game also has something crucial. It has animals...and you can pet the animals. If it had animals and you couldn't pet them that would just be messed up.",1676669118,1676669118,True,0,0,0.489344894886016846,0,True,False,False

I'm going to revisit this review once this game is just better built. But it's really annoying. 

Editing 

I've played a good amount of the game, and haven't been running into as many issues after setting it to full screen windows, no crashes, some minor visual glitches and that's it. 

The game isn't a straight SRPG, there's a big relationship simulation component involved in it. So, be prepared to engage with that layer of the game as well, but you can skip it and go straight to the combat if you want. 

The combat is quite solid, and the character diversity is nice. 
I feel that I'd recommend the game if you like the premise of using Marvel characters in an SRPG, but I wouldn't go into this expecting Marvel XCOM. The social sim is much more pronounced and there is a greater focus on characterizations.

At the time of this review I've played 50 hours and I'm certain that at least 3 of those were just me sitting in loading screens waiting for the game to boot up. 
My computer isn't top of the line but even with all my graphics down to nothing it's laggy and slow and it sometimes got so bad that cutscenes got out of sync with characters when they talk.

I followed previous reviews and made it to where my game skips over the 2-K launcher but even with that fix the game is still unbearably slow. 
There's an entire section of the game I don't bother with at all because every time I try and use it my game crashes, its the data catch missions, when you send a character off for a day to get a special upgrade or something to that degree, every time I welcome back the character I sent off my game crashes. It got so bad I don't even attempt it anymore.

Other than the numerous lagging issues, the game is actually really fun and that's why it hurts so bad to give it a negative review. I've enjoyed customizing my character and playing every other aspect of the game, it's a fun innovative card game, its just when you have trouble actually doing anything in game or waiting forever on a loading screen it diminishes the good the game has to offer.

Also my biggest complaint is the voice acting for the main character.   Ughhhh compared to the great acting for the superheroes/superheroines, the contrast is quite stark.

Review:
Marvel Midnight Suns is an exciting and action-packed turn-based strategy game set in the Marvel universe. As a long-time fan of Marvel, I was thrilled to hear about this game and couldn't wait to give it a try. After playing through the game, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, with a few minor drawbacks.

One of the most significant pros of Marvel Midnight Suns is its impressive graphics and visuals. The game's characters, environments, and special effects are beautifully rendered and provide an immersive experience. The game's story is engaging and features many beloved Marvel characters, such as Wolverine, Iron Man, and Captain America, which will delight any Marvel fan. The voice acting is also excellent, adding to the game's cinematic feel.

The gameplay is fast-paced and exciting, with plenty of variety in character abilities and customization options. The turn-based combat system is easy to learn but challenging to master, requiring strategic thinking and careful planning to win battles. The game also features an RPG-like progression system, allowing players to level up their characters and unlock new abilities and gear.

Another pro of the game is the inclusion of a tactical view, allowing players to see the battlefield from a top-down perspective. This feature is especially helpful when planning out moves and positioning characters, adding an extra layer of depth to the gameplay.

However, there are some cons to consider. The game suffers from some performance issues, with occasional frame rate drops and glitches. While these issues do not detract significantly from the gameplay, they can be a nuisance.

This game is also yet another Marvel based game that turns to Microtransactions to entice players to spend more money. While it is entirely possible to complete the game without spending any money, the option to purchase in-game items with real money can be off-putting to some players.

Overall, Marvel Midnight Suns is an excellent game that Marvel fans will love. The game's impressive graphics, engaging story, and exciting gameplay make for an enjoyable experience. However, the performance issues are drawbacks that should be considered. If you're a fan of Marvel or turn-based strategy games, Marvel Midnight Suns is definitely worth checking out.",1676367827,1676367827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- storyline: A very smooth build up till the great battle at the end.
- combat style: The turn based deck building felt surprisingly right.
- visuals: Sadly enough I had to play on low settings since my pc couldnt handle it otherwise but from what I saw I was very pleased. The cinematics are very entertaining.

Dislikes:
I encountered two 'bugs' so far which were unsynched voice lines, sometimes no speech at all, and a problem with the Hero Ops where since the deadpool dlc no heroes could be selected for the second op.

In short, when making this review I spend 120 hours on the game and loved every minute of it. The gameplay was different than any other game I played but it was a very nice way to go through the missions. The challenge to find the right deck for your playstyle and adjust the heroes to each other can be frustrating when you dont hit the right mods, which might make you grind for the right materials, but when it all works out its great. 
The main game is certainly worth it, the DLC / Season Pass is a bit pricey if you ask me but the content the Deadpool DLC [only DLC available when making this review] was what you could expect from Deadpool. So",1676239233,1676239233,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Is it a perfect game?  No.  Did it need more time to bake?  Yes.  It's janky and glitchy and frustratingly buggy, but the core game is good.  Really good.  Every bit as tactically and strategically interesting as XCOM and, once you get the hang of its quirks, equally as satisfying when you get it right.

If you can put up with some tinkering to get it working right, and you're into stuff like XCOM, Fire Emblem, or Slay the Spire - and you like Marvel stuff, that's a big caveat - it's worth playing.

And if the devs can get it working consistently and well on the Steam Deck, it'll be my game of the year.

EDIT:  After much swearing and trying and downloading and uninstalling and swearing and downloading again, Midnight Suns runs flawlessly on the Steam Deck.  Yes, really.

The tactical gameplay is good for a while but then it gets repetitive. And the game of forcing you to play doll house with the characters trying to build really one sided friendships where you are the one chasing after the others trying please everyone so they can finally get a good card. 

An the analogy with the doll house is quite accurate because you can dress up the heroes in various cloths, outfits and colors. All of this is coming from literal loot boxes, except some that are hidden behind actual paywall. I mean I have payed full price for this game already, why would you ask more money for some cosmetics?

I didn't really liked the story either. Even though I won every fight, somehow kept losing, for the final two missions to turn everything around, and miracleausly turn defeat into victory. There were some good moments, but was mostly your average comic book narrative.

I know that hardcore xcom or deckbuilding enthusiasts have criticized this game as a diluted version of both, but I think the combo works quite well.

Things I liked:
1. The voice acting and character development was great. It really gives you an immersive experience in the MCU and explores some of the lesser-known characters.
2. The interactions between the different groups of allies was pretty well done.
3. The combat was fun and satisfying. I really liked that you can tune the difficulty setting until you find a level that is just hard enough for you.
4. Good mix of progression elements and strategy.
5. A few different types of gameplay keeps the play experience varied.

Things I didn't care for:
1. The crafting system's shared resources heavily discourages you from using your limited supplies on consumables until very late in the game. This makes much of the research tree feel irrelevant.
2. Some of the abilities and mechanics are very poorly tuned. Summon Charlie is a disappointing capstone for Light Hunters, and some of the ally Legendary abilities are way less useful than others. 
3. Lack of variety in Legendary abilities. I spent a few hours grinding out friendship exp to unlock them all, and was disappointed that almost all of them are basically the same, with a few of them having crippling disadvantages for no great reason.
4. The final battle forces you to use random team compositions that are very different than your usual teams. This actually caused me to fail the fight and have to turn down the difficulty setting, which was really anti-climactic. You spend the whole game building interesting team combos, and then you don't get to use any of them for the last fight.

Despite my complaints, this is still one of the few games I've actually finished in the past year. It was definitely worth the energy and I enjoyed it a lot.

In total, it took me 69 in-game ""days"" to complete (nice) and about 80 hours of gameplay. I liked the episodic nature of it, which suited my adult time availability fairly well. I could play 1 or 2 days and feel like I accomplished something.",1676177389,1676177481,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As you bond with your team you can unlock more items and abilities that feed back into the combat systems by opening up new possibilities, like hero combo cards that do massive damage to a single target, or being able to use your move ability to shove enemies or cure allies.

A few of the characters don't develop properly until later and can initially seem a bit useless, for example Magik's ability to move enemies seems really weak at first but by the end being able to reposition multiple enemies around the mission area is completely overpowered.

Die-hard turn-based strategy AND deckbuilders AND superhero fans should check it out. If you're one or two of the three, picking it up on a good sale is easy to recommend. Otherwise, only if it's really catching your fancy

Pros:
* Mission variety maintained itself enough that I didn't get tired of any particular format
* The game is very forgiving of absences between sessions (tutorials, dynamic difficulty selection)
* The characters are mostly charismatic and fun to interact with in RPG moments
* The combat system is very solid and engaging, and deckbuilding has enough spice to feel rewarding

Cons:
* Gameplay difficulty cannot be adjusted mid-mission, requiring you to have a pre-mission save in case you feel frustrated (you can restart the encounter with / without save scum, but sometimes you're just too weak to play your maximum difficulty)
* The final lead-in for the final act dragged on a little longer than it should have
* It's pretty hard to force a single session below 1 hour of consecutive playtime (say a single day/night cycle). The variety of things to do are great, but my average throughout the campaign ended up being ~1 hour 20 minutes per day/night cycle
* By the end of the game, the breadth of card options is smaller than what I'd like. It's fantastically paced but having a few more unique cards to pick from for each character would have been better for me
* Facial animations are a bit dead, which could take some people out of it. Mostly didn't bother me, but I'd understand if that's a big minus for anyone else",1676038546,1676038546,True,2,0,0.52670210599899292,0,True,False,False

Midnight Suns was generally an enjoyable game with tons of potential but is held back by some glaring issues.

[b] The Good [/b]

[list]
    [*]The Combat is definitely the highlights of Midnight Suns. Admittedly, I was first turned off by the card based system and the small/ similar maps you play on. I was really hoping this was just a XCOM but super heroes but this game shows you off right from the start that this is not the case. In the game, you control a max of three heroes who can only perform attacks if you draw a card that belong to them, such as Iron Man needing you to have a Blast card in order for you to use it on the enemy. This may seem restrictive but it adds a layer of strategy and planning for you to maximize the use of your hand while adding in a layer of randomness just enough to keep each battle and turn interesting. Every single hero and their cards respectively have their own quirks/ uniqueness so you will never feel like you're just using the same generic move . Every hero's abilities fits each hero. Wolverine is quick and brutal, Spiderman performs the best dealing environmental damage, Iron Man is super versatile, and so forth. The redraw, move, and item system also adds more layer of strategy that requires you to plan your moves ahead of time. Because of how unique each hero is, you can find your own combination of heroes that synergize the best for your team.

    [*] Design wise, every major character looks great. Every hero's costume has some aspect that draw inspiration from both their comic counter part and live-action counter part (if applicable). Even the unlockable costume you get at the end of game mostly look great on everyone, as it essentially just add the flare/ theme of the game and integrate it into their already iconic costumes. Of course there are more alternative costumes for every hero that is rip directly from their comic or movie counterpart but more on that later.

    [*]I know this is a more controversial ones but being a fan of JRPGs such as Persona and Fire Emblem and even western RPGs such as Mass Effect, I enjoyed the one on one time you can spend with every hero. This game has a social-link system in a sense where you need to build up friendship points with heroes. This is done by doing in game events with them that you invite you out to, taking them out on missions, or even inviting them to hang out after missions that would result in unique dialogues and letting you get to know them more. You can also increase their friendship point (or lose friendship points) by picking certain dialogue options but these are mostly non-consequences as your main way is probably going to be through gifts and missions. Once you reach a certain threshold on friendship meter, the friendship level will increase and you will have a more personal one-on-one with that hero and in turn increase the effectiveness in battle. Unfortunately yet understandably there is no romance in the game (despite some very heavy flirty lines from certain characters) but I enjoyed it for what it is.
[/list]

[b] The Neutral [/b]

[list]
    [*]The story is alright. It isn't bad by any means but its also nothing to write home about. If you have watch any of the MCU movies, then you'll probably know what to expect. Big Bad show up, hero struggle, hero finds motivation, big class Hero win. Its serviceable but after seeing what Marvel games could be after playing Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, I was kind of hoping for more. I do enjoy how they are introducing lesser known characters from the Marvel Comics instead of staying safe with the current MCU stables such as Iron Man.

    [*]Graphically the game is nothing impressive. This game could easily pass as a PS3/ early PS4 era game but it was never going to be the main focus in this kind of game to begin with. Certain parts of the games can be eye candy such as character ultimates but aside from that its just alright. 

    [*]Voice acting feels very hit or miss in this game or just plain off. Certain characters, such as Spider Man, Wanda and Blade, have good voice acting that always fit the mood and characters. Doctor Strange and Iron Man felt very off for me in the beginning since I have not watch the animated Marvel series but they did eventually grow on me. Some voice acting is just not so good. This is most prevalent in the male Hunter which is a issue considering that is the main character. Many of the voice acting in this game just lack a lot of emotional range. There call for moments where certain characters are heated yet all it sounds like was they're talking slightly louder and more strain voice. Then there are moments that call for somber moments and I can only really recall a few people where the tone in their voice matches what they are saying. 
[/list]

[b] The Bad [/b]

[list]
    [*]The is more of a gripe against Marvel content as of late than exclusively on this game, but I do not enjoy how they force every character to be quirky. This is extremely apparent in the beginning of the game when you are first introduced to Iron Man and Doctor Strange. The first hour or so of the game is just quips after quips that made me groan. Pair this with the not so great voice acting and I honestly found myself cringing a lot and thinking about refunding the game. Luckily I pushed through and found the game is pretty good but if are not a fan of Marvel's style of dialogue, you might have a hard time pushing through the game. The writing is also inconsistent too, where there are pockets of really great moments only for the next scene to have bad writing. Some characters just become insufferable by the midway point of the game despite them being okay in the beginning and end of the game and in personal quests.

    [*]The Abbey itself is just not fun. Now I did enjoy the social aspect of the Abbey, but the exploration was bad. Now keep in mind that this isn't mandatory but it needs to noted as it is still a large chunk of the game. Basically the HUB world you and all the heroes reside in is called The Abbey. It is just a boring giant map where you do light puzzles, some of which locked behind the progression of the main story. You get some backstory on the Hunter and other characters but it is just so tedious and boring to go through. The areas are uninteresting and not explained, the puzzles are boring, and your reward for completing it is mostly chests that unlock outfit variation and resources for a crafting/upgrading system that feels pointless. The RPG/ leveling system was also pointless as enemies scale with you anyway.

    [*]The aggressive monetization of the game’s costumes terrible. The base game only allows the base skin(via color variations) and the story skin at the end of the game. Every other skin you will need to unlock by purchasing it with paid-currency or purchasing the season pass. Considering how Guardians of the Galaxy lets you unlock costumes by playing the game, this is outrageous, especially given the price of the game. They don’t hide the costumes by default either, they are always there being waved in your face when you go into the costume selection menu. And its not like these are post production DLC, these were shipped with the game on release.
[/list]

Overall, the game is worth picking up if you are looking for a tactical game to scratch that XCOM itch, but if you neither a fan of these type of games or Marvel in general, you might want to wait till a sale or use the XBOX game pass.

The story is good, the graphics are good and I did not have any problem running the game on a 1080 graphic card.

My problem was with the gameplay. For a card/strategy/RPG game this is extremely shallow.

The game can be divided in 4 parts:
1 - You can run around exploring the Abbey, solving puzzles and finding secret keys, different rarity chests and powers. Seems great right? Well, by doing that you get skins and skins pallets. When you complete it all you get a card for the protagonist, but thats all. Boring, not much of a reward.
2 - You can talk to other heroes, do activities with them and give them gifts. If you say what they want to hear, take them to right places and give them the right gifts you will get more friendship with them. Seems interesting but it is like a boring dating sim. To make things worse, this is used at first to unlock their passive and a bonus on their combo card. After that you get some minor attribute boost every now and then. Extremely boring, not much of a reward.
3 - You got to manage the abbey, research projects, build improvements, create and improve cards, send heroes on solo missions (that are not played) and train with them. The management part of the game where you should be managing resources to try to extract the maximum from your team while trying to build the perfect decks. It's shallow as the rest. Most of your resources will come from missions, so if you want to develop the abbey you should be farming certain missions until you get the resources to do so. But as the other parts of the game, it feels shallow. There is like 3-4 projects that are well worth it and the main ones are for creating and upgrading cards. The upgrading process is tedious as you gotta keep rolling modifiers until you get a good one. Since there are too little options of cards per hero, it is usually better to just keep doing missions and using the improved drops instead of wasting resources in that part of the game, saving it for your legendary cards, the other projects doesnt add much and the solo missions part is just selecting a hero and getting a few cards from that hero the next day. Not much management or complex strategy here.
4 - The last and main part is the missions per se. You grab a team of heroes usually in threes and you play the turn based card game with different enemies and area specific missions. As much as it may seem interesting, as much of the game it isn't and the main reason is that it lacks complexity. First of all, the game adjust the enemies level with the heroes level making the leveling process entirely unecessary. Your strength, then, is more based in your heroes cards and passives, but once again the complexity is low. The heroes passives, with the exception of the main character, are unique, that means you can't change it, once you unlock it via the dating sim part of the game they will stay the same. The cards, even though with some kind of variety, are very few to make any significant difference. Most heroes have a set of 2-3 cards that are really over the rest and once you get those there is not much to do build-wise. The combat is weird since you get 3 plays per turn with your 3 heroes and usually mission actions use a play. Sometimes a hero may not even have an action during an entire mission. The enemies hit very hard and gives a lot of buffs/debuffs so your best defense is to kill as many as possible in your turn. That makes some cards mandatory, and the defensive ones kinda of weak. You will probably go with a fell quick cards (doesnt use a play when you kill), a few heroism generators (talents that usually buffs/debuffs and give you heroism) and some finishers that use heroism. The usual turn is clearing the mobs with quick cards (that generates heroism w/o using plays) throw in a generator, if needed, and trying to kill one or more ""hard"" mobs with a finisher. Rinse and repeat. If you keep turning the difficult slider up you will notice that the only change is that the enemies get a tremendous amount of HP while 2-3 hit killing your heroes (even the tanks). With that you will probably need more defensive/healing cards since you will need 2-3 finishers to kill one hard mob. It makes some missions almost impossible due to time restrictions and make the game even more tedious since you will spend triple the time for each mission without any additional strategic challenge, just bloated up numbers. It could be ""ok"" if there was some better reward at the end but your score will go down heavily, since turns to complete is a criteria for the score, and what the higher level gives you more is XP, which is useless as explained above, and the currency to buy skins which is also useless. A terrible reward for taking triple the time in each mission.

At the end, you can have fun playing the game, but the lack of complexity will make it run dry on fun really quickly. I can see great potential in the marvel+cards+rpg combo, but this game has a long way to go.",1675989095,1675989095,False,2,0,0.481751799583435059,0,True,False,False

I've never played XCOM.

I like Marvel.

I only played on Story Difficulty.

I did not buy the season pass but did buy the Deadpool DLC when it came out.

I really enjoyed this game, it reminded me a lot of Dragon Age in some ways.(Mostly Inquisition because of all the character interaction and relationship building)

I had a great time with the overall experience, I wasn't the biggest fan of the midnight suns side but the characters grew on me.(It helped that I knew who Nico was, I'm not familiar with the Robbie Reyes incarnation, I only know Magik by reputation and not as a character, Blade also by reputation.)

Character Customization is sparse at the beginning of the game(basically your avatar as a human being is about all you can choose,), as you play you unlock a lot of cosmetic choices, make up, extra hair and eye color, several in combat and out of combat choices as the story progresses.

There is a drama between two groups but it's part of the story as they learn to work together. As you learn the nuances of each character you get a better understanding of what they like and dislike. Not every character has a positive out look on life and some are harder to get closer to, Paying attention to the dialogue is important.

There is a lot to explore your in first play through in the abbey grounds. Unlocking blessings and environmental powers.(I did not use the bowl of sacrifice or craft a lot of combat items I found it tedious but higher difficulty players may find it extremely helpful).

Raising relationships can become harder because you have a lot of different characters to work on even if you take them on missions hangouts can be overrided by club meeting.

There is a light deck building aspect to this game( I say as a person that has played games with decks larger than offered here) but there is a lot of customization offered and with the wide range of cast there is a lot of depth to explore if you care to min max each character.

I recommend taking your time with a first play through(there is a lot to do), there is a lot of dialogue in between missions. (If your a more brutal player playing a a harder difficulty may be more rewarding for you)

I found Credits are hard to get a hold of early in the game but as you progress in the game you won't know what to do with them.

I found there are some unique RNG puzzles in the game so some online solutions may not fit your puzzle but they aren't awful take some screen shots.

I found that my game crashed more the closer the release date the game as it is crashes less I recommend manual saving. If you try to run two playthrough at the same time it may be difficult to mange since you can't edit the save name.

~ SUMMARY ~
I loved Midnight Suns! The story was awesome, with a great twist, and making best buddies with all the other superheroes was super fun. I really enjoyed meditating with Dr Strange and hearing his musings about the fabric of reality, having drinks with Wolverine and hearing about his time in Canada. Learning about Magik's brutally harsh childhood provides a richness to the characters that you just can't get from the comics, TV shows and movies. It's such a rich and different way to tell the stories.

Tactical gameplay isn't for everyone, but for anyone who enjoys XCOM, you're in for a treat. I absolutely loved the tactical gameplay, and the difficulty controls are perfect. The skill development is balanced and the character play styles vary too, so it's super fun playing with any of the different characters. And there are loads to choose from! Each character has a bunch of ways you can play with them too, so there's just tonnes and tonnes of gameplay variability here.

The art direction is stunning, and although the character textures miss the mark a bit, the models are great and the environments beautiful.

For anyone looking for a rich and engaging game in terms of story and gameplay, aaaand if you enjoy tactical games, this is a gem.

This game is not for everyone

If you came looking for quick, free-flow combat featured in games like Spider-Man and the Arkham series, you won't find it here. However, what you will find is a satisfying turn based strategy game that is very satisfying when you pull off a combo of cards successfully. Many character combinations work perfectly when you wouldn't expect them to and animations are clean and fun to watch, even after the 100th time.

Then there's the relationship sim aspect. While not a full blown dating simulator, this style of gameplay is still a big part of the game and is where I found a lot of enjoyment. However, it will get frustrating for players here for the combat, so be prepared for that. Each character has a distinct enough personality and becoming friends segways nicely into the combat with you both receiving buffs.

This game never really presented me with any pressure to spend money on microtransations but it was like a predatory mobile game with how many currencies which you never have enough of there are in the game. I dont know why they thought that would be fun. Xcom 2 (same developers which is why I bring this up) had you wishing for more often but that was in a much smaller set of needs that also fit that games themes of being on the back foot and was fun without being frustrating. In midnight suns its like ok well I better scrap this for skill essence and then make sure that I dont spar for the rewards I want to have this other currency available. It really is a game of highs and lows with some of the best strategy gameplay I've touched in a while and some really great characters that get bogged down in unnecessary stuff.

The only stutter I had was getting past my own expectations on voices, influenced by the Marvel movies, and storylines I thought I knew (also the Marvel movies and shows).

However, getting to go on missions with the Marvel characters, and ""hang out"" with them in between was amazing.  There was research to conduct, special ops to send heroes on, sparring and training options, and a huge area to explore around the main base.  Lots of little pieces of lore about the Hunter and the witches, as well as interesting tidbits and stories for every hero.  Heck, I even was in a Book Club with Captain America!

The main storyline was actually really engaging, but as with most CRPGs, you could let it pause and pursue your own goals.  (There was even a story explanation, based on the nature of the pocket dimension your base is in.)  You can choose a Light or Dark path (or walk a balanced road in between) without main-story consequence, which will influence the power selection for the main character.  Some heroes respond better to ""Dark"" conversation lines - and unlike many games, ""Dark"" doesn't mean ""look at me I'm eeeeeeevil!""

Graphics-wise, the game was visually beautiful.  I had a view graphics issues - a few times defeated foes would remain on the field as ghosts, and once only I lost the screen during combat.  Otherwise, the faces are well rendered, rain and water and plant life look very nice.  And combat is gorgeous - the moves are flashy and exciting, and the powers are all fun to watch even after 160 hours!

Bugs - so, save your game before getting the results of a Hero Op.  It doesn't lock up all the time - maybe once out of six? one out of ten?  But 90% of the lock-and-CNTRL-ALT-DEL issues I had with the game came during the results of a Hero Op.  Don't know why.  Might be my machine?  Had three Green Screens of Doom during the 160 hours.

I can't recommend this game enough to anyone interested in the Marvel heroes.  It is *NOT* the MCU, toss that idea out immediately, and then enjoy the game.  Firaxis knocked the tactical combat out of the park (I played on Hero II difficulty, which is like level 3 of 6?), if the heroes are less interesting but the gameplay is a draw.

(I did get the Season Pass, so I also played with Deadpool and his small side story and new general missions.  Deadpool is... Deadpool, but without the Ryan Reynolds charm.  If you like him, then you'll enjoy it - right down to the rainbow and the unicorn of his main supplemental skill.  The new foes bring in some new tactics - I won't spoil anything - but if you don't like them, you can skip the missions they are in when DP's story is done.)",1675831725,1675831725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

WARNING: Mild spoilers ahead!

THINGS I LOVE ABOUT THE GAME- What sets it apart from other titles?

1) Your character - the Hunter - is essentially a fish out of water when it comes to friends and learning about the 21st century, and I love the little things you can notice throughout your daily and nightly conversations with the Midnight Suns/X-Men/Avengers Heroes as the Hunter gains knowledge of the world they woke up in. There are also 3 clubs to take part in (my personal favorite is EMO KIDS)

2) The game is SUPER customizable - every character has multiple outfits to wear into battle and to wear around the Abbey, and all are easily obtainable through chests on the grounds and leveling your friendships.
Although Gloss can be hard to come by at times, if you get into the rhythm of doing a couple of general missions to get Coil, Artifacts, and other goodies to significantly buff the stats of your heroes before going against the Blood Gates and higher-leveled fights, you'll be able to rack up Gloss to buy outfits, accessories, and you'll even be able to replace the paintings in the Abbey with paintings you find, or pictures you create.

3) The day/night cycle is actually something that I really enjoyed in this game. Even though there's an apocalypse on the horizon, when you wake up in game, it gives you a sense of direction and control in your RPG life. You're given daily tasks in the morning, and in the common-areas there are blips to collect. You can hangout at Havens with character you want to enhance the friendships of, and when all that is done, you go on a mission. When you come back, you join a hangout, go to a club, explore the grounds for more hidden secrets to Hunter's past, or you can simply go to sleep.

4) Characters and friendships in this game work very similar to Dragon Age Inquisition as I have noticed. Each character is their own person- they have their own belief system, their own moral compass, and how they expect you to respond to improve your friendship. Same thing goes for Havens, Hangouts, and Gifts too - they'll either like it, love it, or hate it.

Overall, this game is fantastic in my honest opinion. For some friendship guides, and guides to defeating the Blood Gates, here are the links that I have used reliably. 
Happy Playing!

I could go on for hours about the loving and fun treatment that each included member of the Marvel family gets, their sincere inclusions and contributions to the story, the enjoyable simplicity and yet complexity of the combat, the beauty of the visuals, the quality of the voice acting, and more.

I could talk about the enjoyment to be derived from solving the mysteries of the Abbey when not off fighting Hydra and demons. I could discuss the satisfying friendships you can develop with every playable character, or how stat bonuses and other side-quest rewards are neatly tied into that system. But I'll keep it brief.

PROS:
- Nuanced and interesting combat system, easy to learn, hard to master
- Nearly a dozen difficulty levels, from 'mind-numbingly easy' to 'punishingly impossible', and everything in between. Tailor your own experience!
- YOUR OWN PET DOG (SHE IS A HELLHOUND :D) - and YES, you can pet the dog, praise and play with the dog, as well as take her exploring (she will alert you to hidden things nearby!) You can even pet the black cat that roams the Abbey
- Main character is fully customizable, morality system is interesting but not overblown or obnoxious. I've only used the female one, but I really enjoy her voice acting.
- Upgrades, research, item crafting, artifact hunting, 'side missions' you can send lesser-used heroes on for rewards (including cameos from the Thunderbolts, Defenders, Agents of SHIELD, and more) - there is literally so much in this game, all of it completely optional, but all of it generally well-implemented and adding to the experience
- The humor is generally very on-point, I laughed more in the first 10 hours of this game than I have at the last 10 years' worth of Marvel movies, even when those movies were TRYING to be funny.
- Tons of optional cosmetics, from room upgrades, to outfit changes, for both your character and the other heroes. This includes both in-battle and 'relaxing' outfit choices, and palette changes, all of which is purchasable using in-game, easily-earned 'gloss' resources.
- Tons of antagonists, villains and supervillains throughout the story, unexpected twists and turns, but no forced time-pressure
- New Game+ option that lets you bring over all unlocked heroes and use them from the start of the story, especially good for those few you only unlock near the end of the game
- And more!

CONS:
- Gathering 'reagents' (crafting resources) by hand, around the Abbey, night after night, gets very tedious by 100+ hours in. All crafting recipes need to be found, and they are EXPENSIVE!
- Cosmetic options for 'in-battle' costumes are strangely limited, and every character has one 'paid' or otherwise locked outfit. Otherwise you're stuck with palette-swapping their original outfit, several of the palette swaps just look bad. (Though plenty of them look good!)
- Every hero has an 'ultimate Midnight Suns' outfit you unlock when you reach level 5 friendship with them and do their challenge mission, but several of these outfits have glowing flames in really, REALLY dumb-looking spots (whose idea was it to put a single flame in the center of Captain America's shield, or give Captain Marvel a single flame atop a metal mohawk?) - you can 'turn off' capes for your character's outfits, but you can't 'turn off' these frankly awkward flames.
- While the game has nearly a dozen systems I find fun, almost none of them 'interact' with each other (witch's cauldron, item crafting bench, character side-missions, etc) - which can make them overwhelming to a casual player, and you get basically thrown at all of them so you'll know they are there.
- Cosmetics purchased with in-game (non-money) currency don't carry over to New Game+. Neither do crafting components/reagents, or character bonus stats.
- Not all characters are equally-usable, some are SEVERELY gimped or outright useless on higher difficulty levels due to enemy HP creep. This can also apply to post-game high-level missions.
- The ability 'customization' or 'mods' system is RNG-based, which can also become very tedious very fast. However, playing on higher difficulties basically requires using this system for each character, which means spam-rerolling 'mods' for EACH INDIVIDUAL CARD at steadily-mounting, ludicrous costs in resources.
- Research tree just kind of 'ends'... it doesn't much feel like the last research options available are endgame-level 'tech'.
- You MUST come in with a tolerance for 'imperfect' characters - characters who are set in their ways, or full of themselves, or that just plain make mistakes and act out. Marvel heroes are flawed, and they are faithfully-depicted as such here. If you can't stand characters who may not like each other or who make realistic mistakes, you won't be able to stomach the story.
- Still some bugs and glitches, especially after the DLC patch. Plus, some sidequests can be bugged ('Hang out with X character after a mission', but you don't get any hang-out options with ANYONE for a week in-game, that sort of thing.)
- Some minor other gripes.

Tl;dr: Do you love Marvel? Have you been disappointed with the quality of Marvel moves in the last 5+ years? Do you really wish you could just immerse yourself in the world and go on an ADVENTURE with a bunch of Marvel heroes? Then play this game, and do it. This game is a love-letter to Marvel fans, and, in my opinion, amazingly captures the bombastic action of superhero team-ups in tactical XCOM-style combat.

Here's the tl;dr: The combat & strategic layer are [i]awesome[/i], but the RPG elements are so bad they nearly ruin the whole game.

So let me explain. This is made by the same people that made XCOM, and it clearly shows. In XCOM you have awesome tactical battle mechanics but this, by itself, would soon get boring. You need a strategy layer to link those battles together to make them interesting. So you have a home base that you can upgrade, and you have to consider the wider geopolitical mechanics, etc. As a bonus, you also have some mechanics of recruiting and growing your soldiers so you can get attached to them and imagine a relationship with your soldiers.

Great. Cool. A fantastic game.

When you swap the near-future alien-fighting stuff for super heroes ... (and as a side note, by the end of XCOM 2 it was getting so ridiculous that soldiers [b]were becoming[/b] super heroes and it was my biggest gripe with the game) ... you have to make some changes.

For starters, super heroes can't die, so permanent death is right out. Secondly, super heroes don't dash from cover to cover shooting at foes - most of them punch baddies to the moon. So that whole tactical aspect has to be re-thought. What they came up with for Midnight Suns was really clever. A deck of cards for each hero, and you get to play 3 of them a turn. So you might play 3 Iron Man cards, or 2 Iron Man and 1 Captain Marvel, or one from 3 different heroes (depending on what you have in your hand), etc. The card itself dictates where the character will move to (e.g. for Iron Man's lasers, he might barely move and simply blast the enemy, but for Captain Marvel's uppercut, she'll fly over and sock 'em.)

Combine that whole idea with tactical positioning decisions (such as angles to knock enemies to each other, or off the sides of buildings, or using environmental weaponry) and you start to get some really cool combinations. I won't even go into how awesome the moves usually look and how well thought out ideas such as a ""hero points"", shield, revive, bleed, enemy design, and other mechanics are. I honestly think I like this tactical layer better than XCOM, which I loved.

So it is XCOM, but the combat system itself had to be reworked. And it works [b]great[/b].

Now you need a strategic layer. For a team of super heroes, an underground military base where you recruit and research doesn't make a [i]heap[/i] of sense, but it's not too far off the mark. Afterall, there's Avenger's Tower, Prof-X's School, the Fantastic Four's base, and many more similar ideas. So you can have one like that and then overlay many very similar ideas from XCOM.

And ultimately, it turns out they did this. But it doesn't feel like it at first. At first it feels like they tried to replace the strategic layer with an RPG, instead. Which makes some sense. Even more prevalent than a military base for a super hero team is story and character development. So, in theory, it's not a bad idea.

In practice, it's a bad RPG with bad mechanics. It's just full of terrible ideas, poorly executed. The fact that after every mission you can choose one of the heroes you fought alongside with to [i]hang out with[/i] -- I mean, literally, go fishing, or play games with, or go bird watching together -- and [b][i]and that's one of the better mechanics[/i][/b] is and indicator of what you're looking at in the Abbey. 

You run around in 3rd person, within a game engine that is clearly not built for it, picking flowers, finding secrets, talking to people, gaining ""light"" and ""dark"" points for your conversations, picking up random coins and energy around the place. It's just shockingly bad. It's basically Stardew valley with super heroes, inside your strategic layer and base. Poorly done.

It's greatly exacerbated by:
 - the writing and acting which is ... not *shocking*, but definitely not good. (The overall plot of the game is pretty good though, I'd have to say.)
 - Your character is some new hero that you can customise ... which basically means they don't have a real solid *look*, everyone's conversations with The Hunter are pretty generic (and yet, as the main character, you're playing the most Mary of Mary Sue's and the most powerful heroes in the universe fawn all over you), your abilities are OP but uninteresting, this character is forced to go on all story missions, and generally The Hunter is one of the least interesting characters in the game
 - Light and Dark choices lead to unlocks, so you don't really have a choice - you will pick a colour at the start of the game, then just choose that voice line option whenever it comes up, you don't really get a chance to [i]roleplay[/i] your character and so you stop caring about them.
 - The actual good parts of The Abbey is little more than a glorified UI for your base's strategic layer but you have to run between the various points to interact with them, which makes the whole process exceedingly annoying.

But you know what? The strategic layer [i]is actually quite good[/i]. The mechanics behind upgrading a character's abilities and the combat bonuses you get for upgrading various parts of the base, as well as secondary decisions you can make such as who to send on a side mission while you fight the main one, or who should get a temporary bonus for the next mission, or whether to take an injured hero in to the next mission at all ... are all quite interesting.

The other ""good"" news is that you can, and definitely should, totally ignore all the Stardew valley garbage all throughout the Abbey. You can absolutely finish the game no problems without having to go to the [i]Bookclub[/i], or finding all the elemental rods and bringing them back to the altar or whatever ... you know what? I don't even know what all the fetch quests and other garbage are. On my second play through (yes I'm liking it so much, [i][b]in spite of the super hero dating-simulator crap[/b][/i] that I'm playing through again) I noticed some tutorials for ""Words of Power"" which I never used at all. I also have heard of some ""Cauldron"" you can unlock if you do some quests which I simply never bothered with. I also never bothered to get ANY heroes to maximum friendship level... and the game was great. Not [i]in spite of[/i] me skipping these mechanics, but [i]because[/i] I skipped them.

Speaking of cauldrons, this whole game is riddled with Marvel Magical elements. Sure - a couple X-Men, and several classic Avengers are there -- but at least 50% of characters' super powers come from magic. And the central premise of the plot is ""Bad Magic is going to end the world."" I don't mind a [i]little bit[/i] of magic in my super hero stories ... but it takes way too much centre stage here.

Now imagine if they had have set the game in the age of the Sentinels, or something like that, and a team of mutants and other heroes had to take the world back, a bit at a time? Or it was basically any other super hero team and base other than The Midnight Suns and The Abbey. And instead of a no-name hero you control, you were ""the guy in the chair"" who stayed back home and designed, operated, and upgraded the base of operations ... ran the intelligence gathering, etc. That would have been so much better than what we got.

Which leads to my biggest disappointment with this game. If they hadn't [i]totally botched[/i] the in-between mission mechanics by dragging the strategic layer down with RPG / Stardew Valley gunk, this would have been one of my favourite games of all time.

Instead, all I can do is hope that they learn their lessons and completely re-do the strategic layer for the sequel.

(while I'm complaining -- even the ""mission briefing"" is screwed up. Because you literally have to run your character to the transport, you don't even really get a good ""loading screen while a mission briefing explains"" which I really loved from the XCOM games. I hope lessons are learned....)",1675504825,1675752036,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Holy sheet the amount of people who complain about having to pay for certain costumes is absolutely out of control.  Let me break it down for you....

If a developer CREATES something they have every right to SELL their CREATION.  When you buy a hamburger and fries meal combo and the server asks you ""Hey for an extra .50 you can get onion rings"" do you freak out, flip the table, and scream to the other customers how it's bullsheet that you paid for a hamburger and fries but have to pay extra for ""premium content"" onion rings?  NO!  You pay the .50 for the rings or you keep it moving.

So yeah, you have to pay extra if you want that alternate costume.  But you aren't losing anything.  They spent their resources creating the dang thing so they have every right to charge for it.  And you know who buys these things?  THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUY IT!  Stop basing your reviews of a game because you're butt hurt you gotta pay for someone else's work.

So anyway, finally got a couple hours in on the game and my quick review of it is as follows:
Never a fan of card battlers but this one has me hooked.  If card games turn you off I urge you to give this one a try.  You really don't even notice it's a card game after awhile, it really plays like a typical TBTRPG.  And so far there's a good variety of skills that keep things fresh, and each hero has a pretty unique set of cards/skills.

Some people may find the dialogue cringy but I think it's pretty well written and even funny at times.  The one thing I will say is it can get a little drawn out.  Sometimes I wish I could just get to the next fight because the battles are really a joy to play.  But after a few hours you do start to get into story and side quests stories of the other super heroes.  

All in all if you like tactic rpgs and/or card battles, I'd say scoop it up for sure.  At the same time, don't let the cards turn you off like I was at first.",1675688324,1675688324,True,1,0,0.411780089139938354,0,True,False,False

The main issue here is that the game consists of two games and each of the two is average at the best...

Light puzzle solver / rpg is nowhere near as good as full blown RPG games and neither is tactical part of the game anywhere as good as similar turn based games, such as X-Com, Gears Tactics and similar.

Midnight Suns would have been MUCH better game if it was less ambitious ie. if it is focused primarily on Tactical part of the game, which isn't bad but could have been miles better if considerable chunk of resources wasted on the Abbey / RPG part was used in different direction.

Next to all this - we have tons of cringy characters, dialogues, quests and other time-wasting features that are simply boring as fuck... If there is a way to simply play tactical part of the game and skip abbey part entirely, I might have even given it thumb up!

This game is EXCLUSIVELY for huge Marvel fans. If you are one of them, then you might even enjoy this game. 

If you are NOT huge Marvel fan, simply skip this title and save yourself a lot of money that you can spend on much better games coming up...

like everyone else says, I love the tactical battles. 
The story was interesting to me, not boring and not great, but passably interesting. 
The game does suffer from frequent stutters and other technical bugs, nothing gamebreaking, but definitely annoying. Still, I enjoy the game despite the minor but frequent issues. 

My other complaint is the resource system. The system isn't bad on a straight playthrough on normal-hard difficulty, but then once you start grinding for the perfect team setups and card mods, it takes A RIDICULOUS amount of grinding. I've played around 7 side missions now to gather the resources to reroll a single card mod and still haven't found the one I'm looking for. The only reason I'm still playing this game is because I have no other games that interest me at the moment. 

Final take, the game is worth it if you're a marvel or tactical RPG fan. It's quite fun on the first playthrough, and has decent replay-ability if you're into heavy grinding.",1675674791,1675674791,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 The game itself is nothing like x-com. The only thing that this game would have in  common with x-com is that it is turn based. I would compare the game style to slay the spire or monster train. Card game that allows you to have some limited movement in combat. 

With that said, the combat is SUPER fun, and I enjoy the characters you get to play. One of the major drawbacks to this game is the forced loop of chores that you have to do before you can go back in combat. You do a mission, you come back to the mansion and do some uninteresting chore. It's almost as if the developers designed it this way thinking people would get bored and chew thru the game too quickly.  I would've loved if they tried to do the story a little more organically, and just let people go do missions. 

The only other negative have, which is also mentioned in other reviews, I am not sure what is up with us having to launch another launcher from steam. Just weird....

Anyway, the game has the potential to be amazing, but some of the choices that were made, there should've been some more thought around the game play in between missions.

I now have no wish to ever play this game again and feel very let down. The final level has 5 stages - if you fail any you must start over. You only have one co-hero, if they are KOed it is a fail - unlike the entire rest of the game there are no revives. You cannot change the difficult without starting over entirely. There are so many enemies that if they decide to all attack your co-hero they will dies in one turn. It's also very buggy, some enemies do not actually die, and for some reason Counter stopped working. The performance also tanks on this level due to the background effects. It took me hours to get past this mission, but really what I should have done is loaded a prior save and turned the difficulty way down. Utter garbage. 
And you took Hunter away from Charlie again. Go to hell.
End edit.

It's decent. The actual battles are fine, but they get samey as there's not enough variation. Overall I enjoy the game, but it has problems too.

Whoever thought the out of battle movement was good enough should feel ashamed and stop working in games. Hunter's movement is clunky and awful, it doesn't feel at all natural and you contantly get stuck on small rocks and branches which is both annoying and destroys the idea you are an agile superhero. Plus if you want to collect resources and find secrets you will be running around a LOT. It's also an odd decision not to have a minimap, so you must be prepared to constantly stop moving to check the map screen, and always be running back and forth to see if you have missed a plant to collect - which, you know, really keeps the game feeling dynamic and high-stakes...

The writing/scene-setting is also lazily done and the game often self-spoils by having objects or dialogue refer to events and characters before they happen or appear in the game. Is it really so difficult to put some triggers on these things, Firaxis? Have some pride in your craft!

For some reason buttons just don't work sometimes. For character interactions you can generally just walk away and come back and it'll work, but other times you just cannot do stuff and... RIP, I guess. For example, when reviewing my objectives I am told that I can press R to review a hero request, but that just doesn't do anything. On a related note, you cannot interact with rooms or the forge at night. This is never explained and the button promts are still there, but do nothing. I assume this is intended ""no work at night"" stuff, but it could also be a bug. Either way, poor UI design there.

Finally, I find it hard to imagine ever replying this game, because it's both story-heavy and quite long. The Firaxis XCOM games has similar problems with wanting to both be narrative-heavy but also replayable, but this makes that issue much much worse - add to that the tedious resource gathering and exploration in the overworld and you get a game that really outstays its welcome.",1674411049,1675639607,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This isn't XCOM. It's Slay the Spire without the roguelike. Decent idea but bogged down with campaign shenanigans.
The story is bad. The dialogue is cringy. There are a handful of moments where the dialogue isn't bad and you get to have a moment with these characters that can surprise you but they are few and far in between.
Maybe I was expecting a different game. One with a little more customization and randomness. I guess I wanted an XCOM marvel game. This isn't it. 
To be fair it has a solid core gameplay aspect. The cards are surprisingly fun and each hero is unique enough to where they stand out when building teams. In the end though, all you really need is the Hunter. That hero is so broken you can solo a whole mission with just the Hunter. The enemies don't pose a threat but force you to rethink your strategy so I would say they are effective.
The graphics are pretty good. The cinematic cameras make their return from XCOM and work wonders here. Seeing your character get knocked back and break through like a wall and two crates is satisfying to watch.
Despite this presentation and gameplay loop I still felt drained. Playing this game was a chore in the later half and I could only say it was because it wasn't what I was expecting. If the game maybe gave me the option to create custom heroes and cards that I could take on the battlefield then maybe we would be in business but using the predefined hero's cards loses its luster towards the end.

I have always been a big fan of RTS, card games, persona style games etc. This feels like a perfect combination of the games all in one. Yes it does have it's bugs, to be fair. Minor glitching in my experience. The occasion crash, however that has only happened when i'm trying to do other things on my computer while playing the game. Graphics in combat are great. Cut scenes do look a little grainy but something I can easily overlook.  If you like games like xcom, slay the spire and persona, this game will be perfect for you as it is their love child. If you don't, I'd still suggest checking it out.

Story line wise, it does play out like your typical MCU story as an overall. The different friendships you get to do with the characters and getting some more insight to them as a character is really nice. Has a lot of comic book reference. This game is also jam packed with an all start line up of voice actors.  You can tell there was a lot of time and care and love put into this game.

The only aspect I do not enjoy doing is the abby exploration. The very first time you do it, if you care about lore, is wonderful. On other play through after, it feels more like a chore than anything.  Speaking of play through, there is NG+.  I very much enjoy the way they did it. All friendhships carry over and champion levels carry over as well. On NG+ you start back with just the base decks and do have to re-earn everything but it creates the chance for you to come up with your own challenges to test your skills plus the higher difficulties. Example being, doing a NG+ on Ultimate 3 with no quick play card use after the first 4 story missions (you ALMOST have to use them until you start to get cards). Gives you the freedom to have your own challenge.

The previous game from the studio, Chimera Squad, was so buggy I haven't been able to complete a playthrough. Constant crashes and mission logic bugs that require restarts. In Midnight Suns I don't think I saw a single bug though, so kudos to the Q&A team.

If I have any complaints it is that Midnight Suns is a bit easy, at least for veteran XCOM players. In XCOM. you are used to barely scraping by, and any purchase means another desperately needed upgrade will have to wait. Mistakes means you fall behind in the power curve, as does playing it safe and waiting too long. Here resources are abundant, especially if you like to explore and solve puzzles ab it. There is no punishment for playing extra missions that I am aware of and power curve feels inverted, the first missions are the hardest. I will try a replay on much higher difficulties later, maybe I will eat my words.

Game itself is amazing, especially if you're a marvel comics fan with all the nods and references to the characters and happenings in the universe that's never or barely brought up in the MCU.
A few of the downsides:
-MTX sucks for those that want the skins, but at the end of the day they're optional and don't really have any sort of impact on the core game.
-Launcher within a launcher because 2K (there's a workaround)
-Denuvo

Favorite Marvel game of all time. Firaxis did not disappoint. Gameplay is very fun, hub world and characters are also very enjoyable. There are a few bugs here and there, cutscenes can also feel like a whiplash during transitions.
Overall you can tell the team put some heart into this title, and it may be one of the most underrated Marvel title.

If you like entertaining though not necessarily deep writing that features Marvel characters along with RPG, Deck, and Team building gameplay then this is 100% a must buy.

This game suffers from two big problems, which is why I can't recommend it at present. One is the level of monetization packed into this single-player game, which is just plain ridiculous. Certain costumes can only be purchased with premium currency, or require an upgrade to a deluxe or legendary edition, and future characters are walled off by a $50 USD season pass... including Venom, who is already in the base game as a villain. It's shameless greed that has, regrettably, become typical for 2K games. 
 
The second problem is optimization. My PC can run Cyberpunk 2077 with RTX at 1080p with no framerate drops, not at max settings but at high ones. If I turn on DirectX 12 and RTX with this game, though? My framerate slows to a crawl if I turn the camera to the wrong corner of the abbey. The graphics quality is generally what I'd expect to see on a PS4, and yet the game puts exceptional demands on my CPU and VRAM. Disabling the 2K launcher is also a must, due to memory leak issues. Which again raises the question... why does every developer insist on having a dedicated launcher these days?? 

It's just not worth buying at full price in its current state. It stands as yet another example of why we should never pre-order games.",1673276942,1675538694,False,532,14,0.754068076610565186,0,True,False,False

The card combat is good fun and the voice acting is solid which makes for a nice combination.

The main story is totally uninspired (superheroes and magic don't mix in my opinion) and the protagonist is an empty shell that mainly serves as a means of transportation for you, the player. I mean, they have brought you back from the dead to fight your demon-mom, but I don't think they did a great job, 'cause you still look and sound pretty dead to me. But somehow everyone believes you're some sort of legendary hero? I don't buy it. 
I don't buy the abbey either. It looks likes a haunted mansion in Disneyland, with plastic axes and shields on the wall. It's clean, unnatural and never feels homey. And on a personal note, I don't think I could ever feel at home in a place where I can hear Nico's voice. But that's just my opinion though. The game is also very friendly for kids, which is neat, but doesn't help immersing me into the story. I mean, Blade can K.O. people with an uzi. Read that line again. He can knock people out with a friggin UZI!!!
But on the plus side: Voice-acting is spectacular. The fact that you form a bond with the characters is 100 percent due to the actors doing a phenomenal job, especially when you take into account that there are hardly any facial animations to speak of.  Gameplay is amazing. The cardbased fighting-system works like a charm and is one of the most strategically addictive forms of gameplay ever. Starting a new mission is always something to look forward to and doing sidemissions never feels like a chore.  After the fight is done you get to upgrade your cardset, buy new outfits and stuff for your room, which is all good fun, but it wears thin after a while (there is a lot you can customize a liiiittle bit, but never enough to make it feel you designed it). The gameplay however, never does. So, all in all, a bit of a mixed bag with some rough edges, but a fighting system that is a stroke of genius. It lifts the allround experience of the game way above average, even though I still get the feeling that it could have been so much more.

After late January update the game runs stable most of the time. On steam deck it runs very good on high graphical preset. No need to modify any graphics card settings to make it run on the deck side, no crushes after going to sleep after missions.
Cloud save finally works. Can sync between devices without physical save files movement(lost once 30h progress of the game wanting to fix the game on the Steam Deck).

The Game itself is v. engaging, card system connected with X-Com alike turn based strategy does the job, characters are well written with their characters gravitate more to comic than the movie interpretations, f.e. aristocratic, posh attitude of Dr. Strange, Tony Stark playboy, tech enthusiast calling Strange ""dr Spooky"". Frictions and relations between different heroes also give the game a bit of a climatic feel. 
The battles are never boring, You can have so many hero/skill combination with different mission combinations make the game fun. Side activities feel also fun and give a positive progression feeling. 
Overall still not a fan of early release state(almost alpha) of the game, without a demo but in current state I can highly recommend the game to deck building turn based strategy nerds out there :).


Original review version:
First of all I really enjoyed the game, I like turn based card games + the ok story, I was engaged in the Sanctum quest with the secret revealing. Nevertheless the game is in a bad state, especially on Steam Deck. Previously it was crashing once a while and despite the lack of comfort and frequent save game that I needed to do, now it is crashing so frequently that I can't enjoy it even a little bit. 
The recent fix didn't help and made the matters worse, the crashes are now happening almost all the time. Spent around 100$ with the DLC Season pass not to be a beta tester for the game. 
The price was hard to justify normally aspecially with the Season Pass but now it's outrageous looking at the state the game is in.
Probably once it gets fixed I could recommend it.
ADDITIONAL problem: NO CLOUD SAVE for a game costing this much is simply not acceptable. Lost my all progress trying to fix it on steam deck by cleaning out proton files so be aware user!",1670670033,1675506128,True,0,0,0.537572264671325684,0,True,False,False

The game play was fun and the story line started out strong. Additionally, the open map staging area is pretty nice and the game's card battle system has been much more fun than I initially expected. If you like the Marvel Universe, playful banter, and RPG elements mixed with super heroes, then I recommend this game. They just need to iron out those bugs and this game will be well worth the price. Overall, this game is a solid 8 out of 10 and well worth the price (especially if on sale).

Pos:
+ Good graphics with plenty of screenshot moments.
+ The game's staging area is an open map zone where you can explore, solve mysteries and get to know the members of the Midnight Suns.
+ The characters have some witty banter and can be fun to get to know.
+ Quite a few different super heroes team up with. You can interact with them, develop ""friendships,"" and unlock different uniforms for them.
+ The battle system (card style) seemed weird at first but it become rather fun once I got used to it.

Negatives;
- Can be buggy--I encountered several game breaking bugs that forced me to restart all over again.
- Story line is okay but nothing too special. I feel like there was once great potential with this game's story line, but they decided not to spend a great deal of time or resources on it. It's not too terrible, just not all that great either.
-They failed with Iron Man/Tony Stark's personality--he has always been obnoxious but this game just makes him an annoying, scared little kid with facial hair.",1672987683,1675500234,True,5,0,0.589485049247741699,0,True,False,False

There have only been some hiccups as of the latest DLC updates. Deadpools launch came with some issues in the gameplay. The company seems to actively be trying to fix this however. That being said this is one of the best  games I have played in quite a while. 

This game takes a lot of inspiration from X-com but includes a very simple card system to achieve the abilities of each hero. Every hero feels really pretty unique with their abilities and they fit the Comic universe counterparts. It is a bit strange because it seems to be a slight mix of the Comic universe and the Cinematic universe. Though they are leaning more on the comic story line it seems. 

Overall the game is easily worth the price for the base game. I would keep an eye on the updates however and hold off till the devs fix their bugs released with deadpool. Deadpool is a fan favorite character and his interactions are a lot of fun, I do however wish they had taken their time to make sure it was functional 100% before releasing. The speed at which it came out was great, but I would rather quality over expedience and I think the majority of the community can agree. 

Overall Marvel Midnight Suns is a really fun game, I would and have suggested it to a number of people. The biggest thing to say here, if your not a fan of X-com like games you -may- be able to enjoy this game -if- you are an avid Marvel fan. The cast has some of the greats from Marvel that are very satisfying to play.  I look forward to the Venom, Mobius and Storm being released in the near future and maybe even future content beyond that (Though that is all that is promised presently.) 

All bugs aside, the TLDR is, the game is fantastic and worth your time if you like either X-com or Marvel. Fan of both? You should try this game out. Don't let a few hiccups scare you away from an amazing time.

Initially I was hoping for an X-COM clone with Marvel characters, and while this certainly isn't that, it's a solid game in its own right. The voice acting is great, the graphics are great, the level of customization for both your own character and the roster is great, the gameplay mechanics (which I'll expand on in just a bit) is great, and most surprisingly, the Abbey downtime for me was great. 

Starting with the Abbey, I think one marked improvement over X-COM is Midnight Suns' activities between missions. X-COM can feel exhausting if you're playing for hours at a time. Each mission is tough, each mission results in soldiers potentially killed, and each mission loss can derail a campaign. Instead of that, you'll find that missions, while challenging, don't have the same degree of long term consequences. That being said, the difficulty slider is there, and it gets quite tough in the Ultimate range. The Abbey, however, was a treat for me. It feels at first like a simple run and ingredient fetch zone, which turned me off, but there are legitimate bits of lore, puzzles, and exploration is rewarded in more ways than just ""gain X flower"". Breaking these missions up with optional extra-curriculars was great, and had me play for longer sessions than if it was just one mission after the other. The rewards can also be directly related to combat as well. 

Speaking of, combat was great. It's just just about the cards you draw, but knocking enemies into obstacles, knocking obstacles into enemies, triggering environmental explosives, hell, even knocking enemies into your own allies for extra damage. There are layers of combat outside of just the card play economy that feel rewarding. 

The story, while sappy and somewhat generic, still kept my interest. It was a perfect chill and lean back game, and if I wanted some intensity, I cranked up the difficulty and the game rewarded me more for it. 

The cons, IMO, come down to the monetization. I hate being a part of that trope which you find in every game review section, but seriously, having paid skins in a full priced AAA game is just bleh. I didn't feel a ton of pressure to buy anything, there are no pop ups, no power bonuses, and a couple of premium skins are currently free if you redeem the codes, but still. Didn't sit right with me. 

Still, the game gets a thumbs up, and I hope Firaxis continues the series.",1675453578,1675453578,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maxed out all friendships (Deadpool included), bought every possible upgrade to the abbey, done all there is to do in the abbey grounds, collected all collectables etc. Apart from Venom falling out of the map, I had no bugs and performance issues. Beware it's a lengthly game and things slow down time to time but the game does a good job of throwing new things at you at a good pace. I've already bought the season pass and will be starting New Game+ once more DLCs come out.

--So should you buy this game?--
Are you a tactics / card game fan? 
Then maybe see a few gameplay videos and then decide.

Are you a marvel fan? Do you read the comics? Do you like catching (sometimes really obscure) references?
Then you'll enjoy this game a lot, as I did. The game is true to the source material. 

Are you a tactics / card game fan AND a marvel fan?
Buy it.

This is one of the best executed blending of genres I have ever seen. Somehow, it blends the social management aspects of the Persona series with a tactical RPG, a deck builder, and (probably my favorite part) a Metroidvania. Holy dopamine hits! I found myself simultaneously wanting so many completely different things at once - to get the newest card for a character, to unlock the next social level, to get the newest upgrade for my base, and to unlock the newest area of exploration of the Abbey grounds. 

The underlying tactics game at the core of everything is surprisingly deep. I personally cranked up the difficulty as far as it would allow (you progressively unlock harder difficulties), and sometimes I would end up spending 5-10 minutes on my first turn alone despite the limit of only 3 ""card plays"" per turn. As you get deeper into the game, there are just so many different options between repositioning, mission cards you get by killing certain NPCs, and environmental attacks. 

It's crazy and often very satisfying what you can accomplish with some planning if you should so choose. There are times I was tempted to just take my initial thoughts at ""best plays"" that might result in killing 2-3 enemies only to completely clear a 10 enemy board in one turn instead. 

The downside though is that the difficulty started to feel too easy as I got better with my tactics and there never really felt like there was any reward for clearing things extremely efficiently versus just taking the more straightforward plays. A piece of advice: most of the training room upgrades are amazing, don't underestimate them and put them off (the ""shove"" one in particular). I delayed buying them in favor of others because the descriptions didn't really do them justice for how useful they ended up being.

And therein lies probably the biggest problem with the game. All the unlocks and upgrades and cards and mods feel very enticing to achieve, but to what end? It never felt like there was anything to actually DO with all these cool gadgets, which was a big letdown. No optional mega tough bosses or side stories, no real endgame at all. As much as I enjoyed the journey, the ending felt rushed. Likewise, as much as I loved the Metroidvania style exploration and collection aspects of the game, it never felt as rewarding as I hoped. 

There really needed to be another layer of upgrades present, such as leveling up your cards further with more dupes. Another issue was balance, levels felt too impactful and it made playing with under leveled characters annoying and some decks just didn't mesh well or wouldn't come together until a specific card was unlocked.

Now, all of that may sound like a big gripe, and in some ways it is, but it is more of a testament of just how FUN the journey was. I didn't want it to end. I wanted more challenges, more upgrades, more everything because the core gameplay loop is just so damn satisfying. 

As far as plot, the characters are entertaining enough. It was pretty cool having all these classic heroes around each other and interacting, and the voice acting was all pretty excellent. However, the overall story was mediocre. Don't expect too much there and honestly, you won't miss much should you choose to start skipping a few of the more excessive cut scenes or fast forwarding through some dialogue. It's not terrible and it has some moments, but it is all pretty predictable and by the book. I found the back stories of the characters and also seeing differences between what is cannon in the MCU the most interesting aspects. 

With all that said, I give the game a 9.5/10. Despite the flaws, the fact remains that this game simply gripped me in a way that is exceedingly rare. It is a criminally underappreciated gem. There's a reason PC gamer magazine gave it the first ever honorary ""runner up game of the year"" (after Elden Ring).

Super hero life-sim around the abbey: make friends, give gifts, and hear some really fantastic voice acting (especially the female Hunter, Nico, Blade, a couple of Captains, and the All New Ghost Rider are my favorites).

Deck Building Tactical combat. Lots to work towards, I am ~2/3rds of the way through and I don't want it to end anytime soon, I have dozens more combos I want to try and I haven't even gotten the last character in my roster.

A lot of polish on the combat and how individual character's card's play off of themselves and how they will interact with other heroes.

DLC hero lineup seems cool. So far Deadpool has an interesting kit and his lines are really funny.

Charlie-Girl is the best demon dog :)

Cons:
Some just okay Voice Acting, Spider-Man's voice doesn't do much for me, and Caretaker's lines all sound the same.

Your friends around the abbey HATE each other for about 1/3rd of the game, but banding together is a part of a super hero's journey I guess...

It takes a long time to feel like you have an actual build put together for an individual hero, and the basic cards are pretty bog-standard. Researching Gamma-Coil rerolls and extra options are important for making this faster.

I stressed about maintaining Hunter's Light/Dark balance for too long before realizing it doesn't really matter, pick the ones that your friends would like :)

For more depth buckle up.

I'll start by saying that  Firaxis as developer seem  incapable of doing the same thing. Each game brings something different. It's iteration but not just layering on mechanics. It's trying different things and I really respect that. Chimera Squad is different to XCOM2 and Midnight Suns )MS) is quite different from both of the others.

Things I liked (or loved!)

Story:

Many of the reviews have said that the gameplay for MS is excellent but the stuff at the Abbey gets tedious and is uninteresting. This is more subjective, but I enjoyed the story and the social systems. The story is pretty cheesy but it's a comic book game. I feel like cheese is what they needed here. And not every game has to be deep like Last of Us.

I like all the MS characters and enjoyed spending time with them and I enjoyed the conversations on Superlink, I laughed at more than a few of the comments. The game has a great sense of humour. Also I think it pays off in a very satisfying manner at the end.

Music:

The best compliment I can pay the soundtrack is to say that you could swap out the music here into any of Marvel's movies and it would work. Swap out the main theme from MS into that scene in The Avengers where they finally 'assemble' it would work just as well.

Visual Style: 

I love the way this game looks. The environments are interesting. The costume character models are great the super powers feel appropriately powerful. It works well together.

Special mention for the designs of the Lilin. They are quite striking. I also really love the animations for the enemy that splits itself or other Lilin. Those animations are really cool.

Combat:

The meat of the game, and it is well prepared. The card system is interesting and well-balanced. The interplay of generating heroism and spending it is compelling.

What I find particularly interesting is how the game makes you feel like you are controlling super heroes by playing well. Let me explain. On the surface playing 3 cards per turn doesn't really feel satisfying. But when you start using quick abilities, the environmental hazards etc you get a lot more out of those 3 card plays, and you start to feel like your team of heroes are....well super heroes.

Beyond that is how well the game balances that satisfaction to do better and improve with making it faijrly easy to get into. We need to bear in mind that this a Marvel game. People are going to find MS who haven't played an XCOM game before.

I think they did a good job with that.

Dislikes/Issues (heh, issues!)

All that said, it's not all sunshine and roses. There are a few things I'd like to see improved/worked on.

Performance/Bugs:

I did come across a few bugs during my time. One where in a mission I'd set up a hero with 'counter' but it wasn't triggering. I had the game crash on me once and had to restart my PC.

Also the game looks good but it shouldn't perform as badly as it does. I shouldn't be getting the frame drops I got here and there. All in all the performance was less stable than I prefer.

Quality of Life:

In MS you can edit the decks for you heroes, forge cards, upgrade cards and apply mods to cards. Most of which are done on different screens and in different sections of the Abbey.

I'd had to walk back and forth a few times to different zones to fully construct a deck. It got frustrating.

Everything really should be accessible from one screen. And with a better UI, the deck editing screen isn't all that great. 

In spite of those minor flaws I obviously strongly recommend MS. I had a great time with it and if I had played it in 2022 it would have been neck-and-neck with GoW Ragnarok for my game of the year.

This game, however, was definitely made for people who love games like Stardew/SoS/etc. but want a little more action in their sims. If you love Marvel on-top of that- GET THIS GAME!

This is literally a (platonic) dating sim mixed with base decoration/exploration sim double disguised as a turn-based battle system that utilizes card based play (Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded/Hearthstone kinda vibes). I can see why some people may not love what 2K did with this title or are getting bored with it, but for cozy gamers we are very used to repetitive missions/daily tasks and saving up certain items in bulk to make accessories or open chests, etc all in the name of aesthetics or hunting until you get THAT item or piece of clothing.

The story is interesting and I love the different identities that are represented in the narratives. I am excited to see what they do with it as new DLC gets rolled out. This would be the one downside. The game has a great roster of heroes that unlock as you progress - but some of the DLCs coming out I feel may be a tad overpriced from what you will get. The tea is, you will unlock a character that can be used for hours in missions and base-game relationship play BUT their individualized stories may be a bit shorter than expected for the price. I think given the replayability of DLC characters in the original game plus any additional playthroughs justifies the price but that may not be your gig.

Basically, this game will not be for everyone but I think is an amazing first step for any casual gamers who want to transition to something familiar but with a bit more action and requires a different kind of strategy at times.",1675299041,1675330580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No need to pay $3 for a character you do not like. Thankfully, the other paywall costumes are just meh with zero desire to purchase them. You can acquire color patterns for various hero costumes, but before you can equip them, you have to purchase them with an in-game resource. A lot of things are like that, you have to unlock them twice before you can use them. Thankfully, again, the color patterns are mostly terrible, so you do not need to waste your precious resources on acquiring them.

Generally like the game. Its fun and light but its NOT an XCOM which I prefer so take it with a grain of salt.
Pros - Fun RPG light elements - decent game play - interesting mechanics

Cons - Really don't care for the card / random chance mechanic at all. Would prefer an XCOM style skill tree. Would like to be able to lose missions without forced replaying (but perhaps have game event impacts). Also don't care for basic ""battle maps"" type of play.

[b]Struggles before it started:[/b]
I spent the first few hours of game play messing with settings. having to circumvent the 2k launcher [i](not a massive job)[/i] and then try and find the right settings.
I managed to find decent settings even though my PC is way above recommended requirements,

[b]The Game:[/b]
The battles are fun; whilst the pacing needs some work and being able to match cards for combos imo is a massive oversight. It creates a real Stop/Start feeling when trying to combo your cards.
But the cards and animations [i](when they work)[/i] are really nice and heaps of fun.

[b]The Story though.[/b]
Oh boy does it need some narrative love. The core story is cool and concept is fun, I really enjoyed running around the Abbey and exploring, but the tedious interactions and dry conversations really take their toll on the pacing of the game.

I've found [i](more so around the Abbey)[/i] massive issues with texture rendering and lots of bugs with characters getting stuck or just not facing the right way which just puts even more pressure on the drab narrative.
I wish the developers used moving conversation techniques in the cut scenes - making them far more engaging and absorbing. I legit had a stand still conversation with a character who then asked me to come with them - we walked 4 steps to their desk to then go to [i]another[/i] cut scene. [b]Amateur[/b] 

[b]Verdict:[/b]
I really want to love this game - I love the attempt with battles and deck building (has a very D&D meets Deck Builder vibe going on) + there's a story to unfold and roll out some RPG elements to what could have been a really awesome game.

This is not your daddy's XCOM or your sister's Chimera Squad. This here is TCG strategy action with snippets of XCOM elements that kind of make you wish you were playing XCOM2 instead. The actual length of story is not long if you ignore the extra stuff. By ""extra"", I mean the extensive mind-numbingly long and sometimes awkwardly delivered dialogue in your magical home base called The Abbey. That is where you spend the bulk of this title (better get used to it).

When you're not slinging RNG cards at bad guys in the shiny little flat faux-3D playpens the game throws you into, Midnight Suns becomes a character-driven relationship simulator game similar to XCOM: Chimera Squad, but with more fleshed out friendship mechanics and somewhat better writing (albeit with some very cringe moments...I'm looking at you, Nico). I'll let other better reviews talk about the boring technicals and interesting, yet sometimes enormously frustrating gameplay and just focus on the cast:

Hunter = generic awkward fish out-of-water heroic avatar for the audience with major mommy issues (found the female to be a little more compelling than the male (Matt Mercer still did a good job tho), also Dark Hunter dialogue adds a bit more spice to the Abbey chit-chat)
Blade = grumpy discount Wesley Snipes, also... ""YOUR MOTHER!"" (best combat line in the game)
Captain America = surrogate dad, a walking love letter to classic wholesome golden age comic book mentality that is virtually extinct now
Captain Marvel = better than Brie Larson (and that's not saying much)
Doctor Strange = perfect foil for Tony Stark (their banter is some of the best writing in the game), not as charismatic as MCU Strange, but truer to the old comic book version
Ghost Rider = he's alright, not as badass as the MCU version in Agents of Shield, but likable
Hulk = SMASH (also, Bruce Banner is a dick)
Iron Man = discount RDJ (but in a good way), perfect Dr. Spooky foil
Magik = grumpy Russian stereotype, but weirdly likeable and her snarky lines are way more entertaining than...
Nico Minoru = insufferable young millennial with annoying combat cards that have long AF repetitive animations (worst character in the game by far)
Scarlet Witch = Wanda is decent, but in truth she is quite simply............WASTED POTENTIAL (I think Firaxis dropped the ball with her both in story and gameplay, but still better than MCU Wanda)
Spider-Man = very fun and likable as Spidey should be, his friendship with Robbie should make Marvel consider doing live-action or animated crossovers with Spider-Man and Ghost Rider
Wolverine = iconic chill Canadian war veteran badass uncle-type, too tall (devs clearly preferred Jackman's height), also Steve Blum's voice is back (again...yay...)

No thoughts on Deadpool since I won't try DLC content until the full season is released. When all the new stuff is complete, I'll try a New Game+ since I badly need a break from this (the replayabililty is not very strong due to the length and repetitiveness, and also the things NG+ takes away from you such as your cards and first 25 levels not counting the bonus champion levels).

Closing thoughts:
One thing I greatly appreciated (besides the awkward pauses between lines) was the dialogue tree system. This is not your usual Nice/Naughty/Neutral system like Mass Effect or Dragon Age. It's more like Alpha Protocol (bet you haven't heard that name in a long ass time) where nice or professional responses aren't always the best approach. The writers mixed things up by making each character react differently depending on the topic being discussed. For instance, Magik generally likes dark lines, but I found that often the neutral, and very rarely light choices actually went over well with her.

Midnight Suns is worth a shot if you're a big Marvel fan (especially the pre-2010 comics), or just dig that old Sid Meier turn-based thinking-man's game with a little Magic the Gathering flair thrown in. Would NOT advise purchasing at full price, however. Get this one on sale, and for goodness sake, try to play more than two hours before passing judgment on it.

Derived from XCOM, but superheroes take no cover, they (Hulk) smash things on the faces of their enemies.

The Good:
- Fun to play, short missions with some twists to make you adapt your on the fly
- Each hero on your team has a customizable deck, not super complex, but makes you stategize and create some interesting combos with other heroes (the default missions takes 3 heroes of your choice, the story missions have special rules)
- It took me 90 hours to finish, I did some side-questing, but it is more than a lot of games gets these days
- The story and gameplay are well paced, there is always something happening on the Abbey (your homebase) and some new enemy types to adapt

The Bad:
- Anti-cheat software for a single-player game
- Monetization for cosmetics
- 2k launcher (everyone gets one these days for some unknown reason)
- Some bugs here and there, including one that made me restart some encounters
- Kinda expensive (specially if you are from a third world country like me)

One of my biggest gripes with the gameplay is that some stuff around the edges just feels unfinished compared to the old xcom games.  The reinforcements just appearing on the map every turn really takes me out of the game a simple change of having them dropship in like xcom would have been so much better.   Waiting through enemy turns gets pretty tedious later in the game, needs a button to speed up or skip.

Had an absolute blast playing through it and would recommend it to any other Marvel or Turn-based Strategy fans out there!

The only real 'Con' I have is that the game is still a little buggy. Saw a few non-game breaking ones during my playtime such as characters falling through the floor during missions, character's necks snapping back and forth during cut scenes like they were possessed and stuff like that. Managed to avoid any crashes like other people seem to be getting though, especially during the final mission where my GPU usage shot up from the regular 40-50% to 90% and my frame rate absolutely tanked for no reason at all.

And finally, it's also worth noting that the patches for the game seem to download the update and then reinstall the entire game?

2. Fun card-based game mechanics with nice visuals. Graphics are great (in battle and cutscenes, not in the Abbey).

3. Legendary edition has nice costumes, Deadpool DLC has his own story and he's pretty funny and fun to hang out with. He comments on things that happen in the main story and he even appears in key moments throughout the main story that would usually be reserved for the original characters. He sometimes interacts with the other heroes, although not as much as the base game heroes do.

4. If you're into cheesy comic-like story, it has a lot to offer. Unique story and
the bad guys look badass. Although you will be fighting a lot of the same bad guys until you get to act 2. That's a long wait. Story isn't as dark as some people might have hoped but very comic-y.

5. Really starts getting fun after you play a while and becomes pretty challenging on higher difficulties.

6. HOURS upon HOURS of gameplay. Do you like superheroes?!!? Do you like endless gameplay with some of your favorites?!?!? Well this game has it. If you had no job and played an entire week non-stop you would probably only reach the start of Act 3. So lots of content.

7. Customization. When I first wrote this review I said it had none...boy was I wrong...at least for your custom character, the other heroes only really have other colors unless you buy DLC. If you're willing to open lots and lots of chests around the Abbey you can unlock a whole bunch of stuff for your character and change the color of them too. Customization at the start is super...unsatisfying...but if you play a long time into the game its really good. And even though the other heroes only have one other costume unless you buy DLC, they have so many colors you can unlock its insane.

Negatives: 1. Crashes A LOT. Even if you have good hardware. This is the main reason I don't recommend it. If you really want it wait for a sale but...I would also wait for all the bugs to be fixed which...might not even happen. You could play the game on lowest settings and it would still crash. (Found a fix which requires disabling the 4k launcher when opening the game but not sure if this works for everybody)

2. Only one other costume for heroes (except the one you create) unless you buy DLC

3. Underdeveloped: Talking/interacting to the heroes is great but hero hangouts (game mechanic) are kinda of...basic. Same with a lot of the abbey stuff, it all seems...underdeveloped. Especially with the crashes and bugs. Sometimes feels like a game whipped up in a year by 5 guys in one room working with free Unity assets and, unless you are in a battle or cutscene, it looks unfinished graphically. The price of this game for the content you get is probably not worth it. I mean for the game as a whole, not the long hours of content you get. Even if you get the Legendary Edition on sale its probably not worth it, although Deadpool is a nice edition and if I was to recommend the game I would recommend the legendary version.

4. Gloss. You need gloss to buy outfit colors and stuff and decorations. There are probably 1 million outfit colors and the amount of gloss you need to buy everything you want is insane. Unless you play on the hardest difficulty, you probably won't have enough gloss for everything until New Game + gets released.

5. CAPTAIN MARVEL OH MY GOSH WILL MARVEL STOP WITH HER? EVERY SECOND (at least at the beginning of the game) I HAVE TO HEAR HOW ""STRONG AND EPIC AND BETTER AND AWESOME"" SHE IS. NO ONE LIKES HER, MARVEL, STOP IT! The fact she is even in the game but someone like Moon Knight or some other supernatural hero isn't is horrible by itself. Such an annoying, cocky, arrogating person I swear and the other heroes constantly talk about how great she is whenever her name is brought up. I would call it a self-insert but it isn't...its just Marvel for some reason constantly trying to make her seem better than everyone in everything. I don't think most people are fans of (current) Captain Marvel so why is she here? Annoying.

There are things this game could do better, my opinion hasn't changed much since my initial review except that I noticed the customization after unlocking everything is... limited? Half of the clothing options look mediocre and the fact that you can only pick outfits and not individual pieces really bogs it down. The story kind of picked up towards the end, however, there are a lot of instances of inconsistent dialog where the protagonist already knows something but they act shocked by the information later.

I enjoyed the game more than my first review, the card system is fun but some characters are way better than others and its balancing is a little scuffed.


(20 hour review below for posterity sake)
This game is fun but I have some issues.

The card game is fine.

The friendship mechanic is fine.

The customization is actually good IF your RNG is lucky.

The story is fine.

The problem I have with Midnight Suns is that it feels like the devs weren't allowed to fully commit due to IP restrictions. The game play cant be too hard, the friendship mechanic cant lead to romance because these are established characters, the story cant be dark enough for an M rating or you lose the parents money.

I recommend this game on a sale and only if you're a Marvel fan who enjoys card games. This game had so much potential, if only Firaxis could have gone a step further, which I believe is Disney's fault. None of my finger pointing is backed up by any sort of evidence other than Disney's past behavior with their IPs.

If you're having tech problems: bypass the 2K launcher, it works absolute wonders with the performance

The story is...okay. It's not a total cringe fest or the greatest thing on the planet, it's just okay. Now there are some attempts at character moments, many will mean more to serious comic lovers, and I'm a sucker for Bioware style relationship building with teammates, but it's usually a little forced with how every character just ""loves"" the main character that's supposed to be your semi-self-insert. Also, it does go overboard with the humor. Granted a few jokes do land, but there are a decent amount of cringy ones as well and some characters like Blade and Dr. Strange who are way too quipy.

The gameplay is an interesting mix of xcom strategy and card battler and making a winning deck can be fun. Though there are some issues with the scaling. Unlike xcom, you can't position yourself to avoid taking damage, so on harder levels it can just take two or three enemies to take a character down. So unless you min-max the perfect deck and the heart of the cards rewards you, it's near impossible to win at higher difficulties.

But this is a Firaxis game we’re talking about, and being such a massive XCOM fan, I bought it based on my experiences with their previous games. I was not at all disappointed, and in fact, was very happily surprised.

For the first 75 hours or so, I thoroughly enjoyed the game! I really got into the Abbey (hub) story stuff, and exploring the grounds, and finding the books/lore, and doing the completionist things, and all of that. I did very much enjoy the combat, too, but I just had a really great time doing all of the story bits. The pacing of the story with the combat was just excellent for me, and so much about the actual game was so satisfying. 

It didn’t really feel like a card game to me (which was a relief) and I actually thought the card mechanics were handled brilliantly. This has XCOM DNA all sprinkled throughout: from the way the missions are structured, to the Caretaker (i.e., Bradford) speeches at the beginning of the missions, to choosing loadouts (cards), etc. Big difference here, though: Superheroes don’t die, and there is no RNG here; so unlike XCOM, this game will never be tagged with the “That’s Midnight Suns, baby” meme. It’s a mashup: XCOM and SIMS and Persona and Superheroes… and I think it mixes things up extremely well.

The writing is fine throughout and sometimes really good (with a lot superhero cheese a lot of the time,) and the voice acting was solid – with the usual suspects brought on board to voice the characters. You’ll hear Varric/Bradford, and Oghren/Grunt, and Lyris/Shepherd, and Jack, and Lucius Malfoy, and Matt Mercer and Laura Bailey (because of course) and on and on and ON. It’s an All-Star cast, to be sure. It’s sometimes hit or miss, but it’s definitely A-Team in a lot of the casting.

My biggest problem with the writing - and it is really a big one, is that it has dated itself pretty significantly, and will likely not hold up very well over time. With the many references to ""Boomer"" and ""Gen Z"" and ""Vegan"" and ""Emo"" and so many other culture-current references, it is too much Of A Certain Time, than truly Timeless. I felt like it was trying too hard to seem culturally and currently relevant, appealing to a very specific age group at this moment; and for me, it feels almost as derisive as IRL at the moment in certain places. 

As of this writing (end of Jan. 2023,) the performance absolutely tanks for the final mission (I’ve got a well-above average system: RTX 3080, Ryzen 9 5900x, and 32gb memory) and the only fix was to save mid-battle and restart a couple of times. Frames consistently dropped into the 12-15 range, and it seems as if there’s a possible memory leak happening. It seriously disrupts the flow and vibe of the last battle and hour or so of the game. I really hope this gets fixed.

For most of the game, I didn’t have many too performance issues outside of the very badly optimized ending. In just about 90 hours, I encountered a few annoying UI bugs, and only had two crashes. I’m sure that this will all be patched up over time.

Speaking of time, while I really do recommend the game, I would strongly recommend waiting for a few months before purchasing it. I don’t necessarily think it warrants a “buy it on sale” thing – I think it’s absolutely worth the full price, but the bugs need to be stomped and the performance issues sorted out before I would give it a full and unequivocal recommendation. 

Knowing how Firaxis has handled XCOM’s expansions/DLC in the past, I’m hoping that they will follow suit on this one and give us a major expansion (like a “War of the Chosen” kind of game changer.) All we know at this point, is that four new heroes DLC will be released piecemeal and at an unrealistic price point (15 bucks a smack.) And though there is the (much-dreaded) “Season Pass” which unlocks all of the upcoming DLC characters (and the misguided “locked-beyond-a-paywall” selection of gear/outfits) all of this feels insubstantial to me for the amount of money 2K is asking for it. What feels more necessary for me at this time, is to fix the bugs and performance issues, and to bring us a solid (and actual) expansion or two. The new DLC characters hold very little interest to me, though I know that there are a lot of people who will appreciate them.

About the Ending: (there are no story spoilers here, just my take on the end of the game itself. Skip this next paragraph if you're so inclined...)

The end felt incomplete to me; abrupt and deeply unsatisfying. With such an enormous narrative build up and a pretty “epic” final battle sequence, there was no final epilogue or completion. It feels like they’ve left it open for further development, and it wasn’t so much a cliffhanger, as just a somewhat rushed and unpolished ending. There was nothing to really put a “period” to the long, 90-hour sentence. There are tiny cut-scene bits during the credits, but it didn’t give me a sense of completion or satisfaction. XCOM games end pretty abruptly too, but for a game that is so heavily story and character focused, I was hoping for a “True” and satisfying ending.

I’ll likely do another playthrough of the game once all the DLC and (hopefully) expansions come out, but I’m not drawn into NG+, or starting a new game, or anything like that at this time – which is also what makes it so different for me from XCOM.

There is so much potential here, and I’m hopeful that Mr. Solomon and team will be able to continue to polish this gem.  Such a load of really great work here. It really is a standout among games.

Incidentally, Jake Solomon was recently quoted as saying that there are no plans to continue with the XCOM series… Now that’s a heartbreaker, for sure. (Say it ain't so, Jake, say it ain't so.)",1675087219,1675090564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have a LOT of hours in xcom2 and am a fan of these types of games although the card based combat was new to me.  I think I reached over-saturation with superheroes about five years ago, but since there is still no sign of a new xcom game, I figured I give this a try.  Combat is pretty fun and requires some thinking and strategy(especially at high difficulties.). Although I think it could be increased in some areas.  My only complaint is in the relentlessly long and tedious in between battles collecting and friendship grinding.  So sick of reading and listening to STUPID goofy friendship talk.(maybe if you are a bigger Marvel nerd than me, you might like that, but I doubt it).

Wildly ambitious, it merges Firaxis's classic [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/200510/XCOM_Enemy_Unknown/]XCOM[/url]-style game-play loop of tactical battles and a strategic layer with a fun RPG-cum-dating simulator and an engrossing adventure game, and changes those long XCOM battles to incisive rampages with a clever card-drawing mechanic. In many ways the missing link between XCOM and MMS is the under-appreciated [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/882100/XCOM_Chimera_Squad/]XCOM: Chimera Squad[/url]. Both put their focus on strong characterisation and what XCOM:CS calls “breach” battles. MMS also has something of a feel of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1184050/Gears_Tactics/]Gears Tactics[/url] in its battles' emphases on power fantasies and show-off set-pieces. If you liked those games, you're likely to enjoy the combat here.

The combat remains the heart of the game, and it is very enjoyable. The heroes' cards are varied and powerful, befitting the superhero theme. The enemies are mechanically interesting to fight against: many will feel very familiar to XCOM veterans (including visually), but XCOM is great so that isn't a bad thing. One of the game's best innovations in the tactical layer is the auto-adjusting difficulty level: if you are winning battles convincingly, the game will challenge you to up the difficulty, rewarding you with faster levelling and extra “gloss”, the cosmetic currency. I reached the top difficulty level, Ultimate III, but felt that Ultimate II was a more enjoyable experience and so returned to there. Matches do get quite long when you up the difficulty to the highest levels, as you have to keep iterating to find the successful path, but in general they are punchy and constantly active—no slow wandering, searching for the enemy squadron, like in XCOM.

The gloss cosmetic currency is not purchasable with real money, but only in-game, primarily through winning battles on high difficulty. Each companion hero has four possible costumes, and some of those—quirky variants often themed around obscure episodes from their past adventures—are purchased with real money (including via the Legendary Edition, which also includes the Season Pass for upcoming DLC). All of the player character's costumes are unlocked via game progress. Gloss is used primarily for unlocking colour palettes for the player and the heroes (and tarting up the player's bedroom). To me this felt like a fairly good compromise between principled refusal to include pay-to-win mechanics, and Marvel's inevitable rapaciousness: given that Marvel were bound to grasp for more cash, this was a reasonable way to do it, and if you get the Legendary Edition the extra costumes are effectively free once you account for the Season Pass.

The strategic layer takes up a lot of the game-play time, especially in the early game. Partly it is conventional strategy-layer stuff: tweaking the decks, upgrading the characters, purchasing base upgrades, etc. Partly it is a light (and entirely Platonic!) dating simulator-style game, where you purchase gifts for and go on friendship-dates with your chaste superwaifus; this can sometimes be a bit corny in its ardent declarations of friendship, but it manages to be endearing for the most part. And partly it is an adventure game walking simulator in which you jog around woodland gathering mushrooms for crafting and solving mild puzzles to unlock secrets, new areas, etc. The first is essential for a strategy game; the second is silly fun; and third is relaxing downtime between those intense battles.

How much you enjoy the story and writing will mostly depend on your tolerance for capesh*t, especially Marvel's flavour of it. I can take or leave the MCU, and found the story to be silly but fine. The writing is definitely quippy (thanks Joss Whedon) and probably funnier than an average Marvel movie. Like all superheroes, the characters are all very broadly written, and very much conform to their archetype. Iron Man is braggadocious, Doctor Strange is pompous, Nico Minoru is an edgelord, etc. Again, if you like capesh*t you'll love this, and even if you don't (like me) you'll probably find it to be fine, which is for the best as there is a lot of talking to them involved. (NB: You can tap Esc or right-click to skip individual lines of dialogue.) The final act (of three) is a little disjointed and felt as if they were running out of ideas, but hey, that's why it was the final act. Even so, the story is more coherent than the XCOM 2 story, which players often have to have explained to them after they complete it! There are some changes to what I understand to be canon: a minor character has been sex-swapped and two major characters are dating. If you are a Marvel purist (lol) then you have been warned.

The graphics are a huge step up from Firaxis's usual strategy-tier (i.e. functional) graphics, which was necessary for implementing both the VN-style chats and the woodland adventure game. That does not mean they are up to the standards of a high-end narrative-driven adventure—RDR2, say. Characters' faces are stiff when they talk and there are a few graphical glitches. But this is at heart a strategy game, not a full-on adventure, and the game looks more than good enough for what it wants to achieve. Some characters feel as though they had a lot more effort put into their combat visual effects than others. Nico Minoru, Doctor Strange, and Ghost Rider are all especially good. Some late-game characters feel distinctly lacking by comparison. I found the voice acting to be mostly very good. Nico Minoru in particular managed the very difficult task of making her potentially very annoying character warm and sympathetic instead. Male Hunter, Iron Man, and Magik all also deserve special mention.

The game was a bit over-priced on initial release, probably to try to make up the cost of the Marvel license. On offer though it is good value if you enjoy XCOM. My 169 hours (at time of review) is for *a single play-through*. I should caveat this by reminding you that I played on Ultimate II/III for most of the game, which meant I had to spend multiple hours on some battles trying to figure out the best route, and also by telling you that I love taking my time in general and am also a compulsive completionist and in-game hoarder (I had thousands of mushrooms and flowers stored up by the end!). Most players find they complete the game in about a third of what I took. However, clearly there is scope for you to sink hundreds of hours into it if you want.

[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]
Midnight Suns up until the end game was a mixed experience, on one hand, the combat is fun, and has a decent amount of depth, on the other hand, you spend more time listening to useless dialogue than anything else. Still, talking to your favorite heroes like Spider-Man, had its moments, however, the end-game and the bugs completely soured my whole experience with it. The gist is, Midnight Suns is a waste of time more than anything else, even if you are a fan of superheroes, its decent combat can not save it from being a mess. 

👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]
+The combat is fun and has some depth to it
+Spider-man

👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]
-A technical disaster
-Too much pointless and cringe dialogue
-Female hunter voice actor is horrible
-The ending

[h1]Story[/h1]
Right, so the Midnight Suns are a bunch of teen emo superheroes formed to stop big bad guys. They are joined by the Avengers to stop a bigger threat called Lilith and this is where you come in. You get revived in order to stop her because you are her daughter/son and you are the only one strong enough to do it for...reasons. That is correct, the strongest superheroes like Captain Marvel or the Hulk are useless for...reasons. 

Anyway, you create your character, and you start to befriend and recruit superheroes in order to stop Liliths threat. You may be thinking, wow that is so cool, I get to talk to all these heroes, and you are partially correct. For the first few hours, it seems cool, but as you play more and more, you realize the story is nothing, the dialogues are useless, and nothing you do changes anything. The world is in danger, but you spend 85% of the game time watching tv and walking around woods with these heroes, who talk non-stop nonsense stuff. 

But the worst offender is the ending and the ""twist"" if you can call it that. I can't talk about it without spoiling so stop reading here if you really care but ""shockingly"" Lilith, who has been murdering and killing all these people, was actually trying to stop Cthons invasion????? which she literally started??? All the time she tells the player, ""you do not understand child, I do this for you and whatever"" and then she saves the day. I am not kidding. All the mightiest heroes do nothing, and she literally does what any of you could, and ends the final threat. It was the dumbest fking ending in the history of endings. I need to wipe my brain out of this idiocy. 
 
Story rating: 6/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
At least the gameplay is fun, right? Partially wrong. The gameplay is split into two big aspects, the card combat, and the Abbey exploration. Let's talk about the latter a bit. When you're not in combat, you're in your base with all these superheroes chilling like nothing bad is happening. You walk up to them and engage in endless amounts of cringe-inducing dialogue, sometimes you upgrade and unlock cards and increase your friendship with them and finally, you can explore the Abbey grounds to unlock its mysteries which are a bunch of chests that give you colors for your clothes. The peak of gaming entertainment. To make matters worse, this is not an optional thing or something you just briefly spend time with, no, this is actually more than 60% of the entire game. 

The better part of the game is the card combat. Each hero has their own unique card mechanics. For example, the most useless of them all, Blade, has cards that focus more on bleeding the targets, or Captain America, one of the best ones, has a huge focus on taunting and blocking attacks. There's a lot to talk about here, the card combat has a lot of depth and I do not have unlimited space so I'll keep this brief. You have a limited amount of cards to play per round plus moves which are your way of positioning your heroes or you can use the moves to push enemies into debris, explosives, or other enemies, and the items which can grant you different things like healing, free cards, etc.  Cards are split into 3 categories, skills, attacks, and heroics. Skills and Attacks grant heroism points that you can spend with the heroic cards. The rounds are endless most of the time unless you complete the objective you are tasked to do, such as stopping a truck or capturing an agent. 

There is a ton of things to talk about the combat but little space, suffice to say, its mechanics can go deep, difficulties unlock as you get better at the game, and overall you're going to have fun with the card system, assuming, of course, you can get past the other aspect of the game. Remember, Midnight Suns are not just a card-battle game, it's more about wasting time with your favorite and not-so-favorite heroes than anything else. Do not purchase the game thinking you're going to spend more in combat because you CANNOT. You are forced into the Abbey parts because you can only do one mission per day. Yes, you read that correctly. You start your day normally, do abbey stuff like upgrades, training, and dialogue then you start a mission, play 10-20-30 minutes and you go back to the Abbey wasting your time an hour before you repeat the same thing over and over. 

Gameplay rating: 6.5/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
I'll keep this short, besides Spider-Man, Captain America, and a few others, most of the dialogue is max cringe, but your main character's voice acting, the female voice as I have no idea how the male one is, is dog-sht. I initially thought she sounded dull and dumb on purpose because you just woke up from hundreds of years but she never improves. 

The soundtrack is pretty good, doubt you'll get bored of the heroic songs and as for the sound effects and everything, they're all fine. 

Audio rating: 7/10

[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
Tech-wise this game is a piece of junk. I forgave the devs in XCOM 2 because I thought they made a really complicated and long game, and they were still rather new to all of that, but there is no excuse for their 4th game. Just like in xcom2 whenever you destroy an object or hit the ground, it shatters into hundreds of pieces of debris which will tank your framerate. There is no way to disable them, and in the final mission, any attack will lower your framerate to 20's on a high-end PC. This has been an issue from launch, but all they've done is focus on their paid DLC. 

The devs are so out of touch that they even added DLSS 3, but without actually adding nvidia reflex. If you're not aware, DLSS3 or frame generation adds input delay. All the DLSS3 games I played automatically have and enable nvidia reflex which reduces that delay so much that it feels even better than before. Midnight Suns doesn't have that, so using DLSS3 will add a significant amount of input delay. 

The game is also filled with so many bugs that I just can't be bothered to list them all, but it's obvious what the devs priorities are when a hero card attack always teleports that hero in the ground and back up. There is no way they did not see this, or the debris tanking framerate, or the end mission being a total fking mess. 

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 5/10

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Don't bother with Midnight Suns. It baits you in with these cool heroes and cool combat mechanics only to shatter them into millions of pieces and give you a middle finger for actually buying this waste of time.

Extremely addictive. And despite it comes from the XCOM developer, I feel much more thrown back to the Dragon Age Origins times.
The graphics are not so different either, quite outdated at the time of release, and it doesn't matter even, because it's fun. Not always good written or acted, but it has an interesting base story with awesome characters (Superheroes in these case).

One of the coolest parts is that it's not all Avenger or X-Men, who we see on TV so often. Ghostrider and Blade might have had several Movies, but they are still not mainstream. 
I wished they included more original Midnight Sons, or fitting characters like The Punisher, Werewolf or Man-Thing, Carnage, Moon Knight, Shang Chi and so on. Anyone with Magical or dark demonic.
Maybe that's still happening in an expansion, fingers crossed.

Pros:
- The combat is fun, definitely a nice refresher from XCOM
- Personally, I like the card system
- The lore around the abbey is interesting and fun to explore in your off time. 
- I like that you can grind side missions and enhance things without having to progress the story too far. But to get a lot of the lore, you do need to progress into the story which doesn't seem obvious at first. 
- I like the upgrade systems

Cons (really only 1, but it's so prevelant in the game and a lot of people won't see it as a Con):

- The friendship system is the cringiest thing in the game. EVERYONE is obsessed with you in a weird platonic way. And you have to spend a lot of time entertaining them via dialog choices to try to make them happy. The game, imho, would have been better off without the friendship factor. Taking them on side missions would have been enough (as it slightly increased friendship) and cut scenes to go over their thoughts would have sufficed. However, you have to do friendship because it helps you throughout the game; however, it would have been a lot more fun without the cringe dialog, but I hope Marvel Fans enjoy it.
- Tony Stark is the most annoying NPC. 
- Everyone, I MEAN EVERYONE, is so whiny. But I suppose it humanizes these super-powered beings.

Summary: Recommended, but wait for patches. I want to play again from the start but I will wait for all DLCS to release and bugs to be fixed.

Good: 
- Card based battles is something new to me and I liked it. Heroism and environment management mechanic is also a good layer to the strategy.
- Hero challenges to unlock legendary cards are good.
- Story for me is ok. Without the side stories it is something interesting.
- Battle visuals are good. Performance is a different story.
- Deadpool!

Bad:
- BUGS! Especially upon release of Deadpool DLC I wasn't able to play the game until I restart my PC.
- Achievements for the DLC did not unlock. I have finished the story, finished the challenge, no achievements unlocked.
- Performance sucks. I have an AMD 3600, 32GB memory running at 3600 and a 3070 gpu, running it at 1080p and capped the fps at 60 on Epic settings. average fps is around 35 fps. Final battle at some point  dropped at 10 fps in the rest of the battle.

Ugly:
- collectible items gathering around the abbey. I did not enjoy walking around and gathering stuff. This took me a lot of time.
-  There are otome like conversations. while I like the conversations, I am not really interested if there's a love story brewing within the group (subjective of course).
- Hulk cannot smash on the 90% of the game. Very disappointing.",1674922734,1674922734,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The gameplay style intrigued me and obviously I love the concept of playing a RPG with Marvel characters, so I followed it. When the price dropped to $40 I jumped on it.

I'm liking it so far... the story, the gameplay, the turn based/card based strategy, the relationship building is fun. I really think they missed out on the opportunity for a romance option... I think all the games I get the strongest connection out of (Cyberpunk, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Witcher) has that aspect... and it feels like you're doing so much to build close ties that you would think something like that would form with someone in the Midnight Suns... but I get it, this is Marvel so it has to stay ""clean"" and they probably wanted to avoid all that... especially the chance for a same sex relationship (insert facepalm).

- One thing a bit tedious is running around and picking up the motes of Attack/Skill/Heroic/Gloss essences... a little annoying
- Organizing your cards can get pretty rough when you start to build a large deck. Maybe this is something hard core players enjoy but can get pretty rough when you don't want to put all that effort into it.

It's surprisingly satisfying to think of a plan and then executing it (assuming you thought of everything). 

I however do get tired of doing many of the (optional?) busy work stuff between missions. The clubs, the friendships, the collecting. There are some fun conversations here and there but most of the conversations ends up with the bare minimum of choices and are mostly determined if you want light points or dark points. 

It also doesn't help that aside from the familiar heroes I couldn't care less about the Midnight Suns (maybe Blade excluded) and the way they are portrayed in the game does nothing to make me care whether they like me or not. 

The voice acting is mostly fine, the dialogue can be very corny, especially concerning friendship conversations (Magik telling Hunter not the use the F word for example, where the F stands for Friend). One thing I noticed is that even though if you become like BFF  with Tony, in the story cutscenes nothing of that reflects back, Hunter treats Tony like a stranger/interloper and referring to him as Stark.

You get to run around an overly large 'home base' area finding stuff, talking to people and crafting.  All of which takes far too long and keeps you away from doing the fun stuff.

I can only assume that they didn't have sufficient faith in the actual game (the tactical combat bit), so they added all of the largely pointless running around so the game was full of 'content'.

But I have just encountered some sort of glitch after completing daily/evening tasks around the Abbey and after going to sleep my character wakes up and I think it is a tutorial for the photomode- character and blade are sparing in the courtyard area and I can use the game menus and take pictures of them, but nothing else works and I am unable to fast travel out of it. There is no in-game indication for what I need to do to proceed and the camera just continues to automatically pan around the two characters as they spar. Not sure if its a timed event or what but my game is basically stuck at this point and I have loaded and reloaded saves and even re downloaded the game. Still no luck fixing this issue. 

The gameplay is okay. Abbey tasks and progression is okay. Combat is mostly fun though some of the early missions are a bit difficult because you simply don't have great cards. The game does lag a lot and it seems like its freezes almost every time you load the menu after any mission and sometimes the save menu lags and freezes for a minute before working properly. In terms of story, it does not seem to be paced all that well because the threat is huge but there is no sense of urgency with what you do once you are in the Abbey after missions and in the mornings after you sleep.

The game play is solid and the missions are fun. They do start to get repetitive if you're a completionist like me and want to be besties with everyone.

Firstly, let me say that I wasn't expecting to like this game at all. I've come from the X-Com fanbase and was looking at the card system they put in the game winced so hard I pulled a muscle in my neck. However, I could not have been more mistaken. It's not an X-Com game at all though, it's an in depth puzzle game with a marvel skin and story.

The Goods: The music is excellent and keeps you thinking marvel the whole time without being anything recognisable. They capture the vibe of the universe perfectly. The Voice acting is STUPENDOUS. At the start, it felt slightly off because you expect their marvel movie voices, but before too long you'll be wondering how you ever felt their voices were weird. They're actually perfect. The story is also excellent. It's not too derivative and switches tack  just often enough to keep things interesting, constantly introducing new characters as you go. You'll find yourself maybe going to quick in the story just to get those unlocked. The combat/puzzle game is great and super deep when you get to the higher difficulty levels. You may be forgiven for thinking it's a bit simple at the start but things get much harder and interesting when they introduce new enemy types and passive/active abilities to your squads. The card system actually becomes quite involved with redraws and deck building. Though sceptical. I ended up loving it.

The bad: There is a base in the game called the abbey, that you wander around unlocking things. The first time you do this, it's mildly interesting. There are the odd hidden thing that if you bother to read will raise and eyebrow, however... this part of the game severely hurts replay-ability. I found it super tedious on my second playthrough and I had even forgotten a few things which I ended up looking up. The problem is you HAVE to do it because the bonuses to your characters are too much not to. The friendship system also suffers on the second playthrough. On newgame+ you don't need to do anything as it carries forward so there is that.

The ugly: The only deck in the game you can make really that varied is the hunter. The other characters have maybe 10 abilities each and you quickly work out what are the best and then that's that. There's no variety except in getting modded cards which is so expensive to reroll consistently, you basically have to wait and get them through mission rewards. This means, you intentionally bring out different hero combinations just for variety. I feel like Firaxis really could have made all the hero decks as expansive as the hunter deck and didn't just to save them development time, and it sucks.

Overall, I absolutely love this game. This marvel puzzle is fun and involving. I've played about 150 hours of it so I'm getting my money's worth despite the higher price point than I would expect from a firaxis game. Newgame+ on the highest difficulty was a real challenge which really kept it interesting. I can see myself coming back to this  (for a third playthrough!) when the DLC's go on sale for extra variety in characters and story missions. 

Solid 9/10, even coming from a sceptical starting point!",1674817518,1674817518,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you ever asked yourself questions like, ""What would Spider-Man post on Facebook and what would a comment from Blade in response look like?"" this game will give you an idea. The game does fan service really well and large parts of it feel like it's (admittedly well-written) fan fiction. So if you're a Marvel fan boy, this will scratch that itch. I didn't like the main character of the Hunter as much because they're your typical ""blank slate"" character that comes off very shallow and bland to me. But YMMV.

If you're looking for an X-Com clone, this might be what you want, but maybe not. The deck-building element is done really well, but there's less tactical depth overall. Most of the time you're fighting the same types of enemies with the same theme of maximizing your action economy, which is...not too different from X-Com. So maybe I'll take that back. Certain heroes have abilities that obviously synergize with each other better than others, and since they're all Marvel characters, there's no real opportunity to build a team of ""Your Dudes"", especially if you're min-maxing.

There are certain minor inconveniences. It's not clear when I'm in a cutscene and have to sit through everything (otherwise I skip the whole thing) or if I'm having dialogue that I can skip through line-by-line. There are lot of fan service things you can check out; in my opinion they don't add much depth to the game but you feel compelled to do them because the HUD is always popping up all these notifications. Annoyingly, resting (which you do after each mission) triggers 3 cut scenes you need to skip.

Overall, if you want an X-Com clone and you're a big Marvel fan, this will be what you're looking for. I'm admittedly not as into it as most people (much to the chagrin of my friends, who absolutely love this game and can't understand why I'm ambivalent to it), so it's a very ""Meh"" game to me at the end of the day.",1674793853,1674793853,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm still wishing for a ""neutral"" review as this game has some pretty major flaws, so I'm not recommending it.

Long story short, the card mechanics is excellent, the gameplay is excellent. The walking around the Abbey and interacting with the characters is excellent for the first 30 hours...then it gets incredibly tedious. If there are demons roaming the Earth, sitting down to play a game or going to forage mushrooms is weird. It's also boring. I don't want to walk around with Spiderman foraging mushrooms. The game is full of weird bloat like this, the conversations don't feel right, they feel odd and superficial. I want lore, I want exciting dialogue. Sure have some down time every now and then, have some moments to ground the characters but the whole game is grounding. It's boring book clubs, it's ""shop"", it's wandering around a completely empty world looking for story instead of sharing it with the interesting characters.

There's also a lot of weird design choices. There's about 8 different ways to upgrade or create cards/items instead of one. They are all over the place and pointless. The currency they cost makes them worthless. The early ""normal"" cards/items are sometimes vastly superior to the legendary expensive ones, or epics. There's about 6 currencies. It's just all way too much. Then when they do come up with a cool concept(challenges), they are locked behind hours of grinding ""friendship"" levels. There's just too much stuff and none of it has real substance. The stuff that DOES have real substance is locked away for no real reason.

Finally, microtransactions have no place in ANY single player game, even cosmetics. Go away, I paid for your game, give me the game. It's such a terrible practice, as are season passes with characters clearly in the game locked away behind expensive DLC.

It's all a shame because the gameplay is really fun when the game lets you play it. I'm sure the story is ok, I stopped being engaged in it 40+ hours of fishing with Captain Marvel and giving Blade vivaldi albums later. If anything, the gameplay kept me playing despite me really wanting the inbetween bits to go away so that's worth something. 5/10 overall, get it on a sale.",1672020738,1674776609,False,2,2,0.540568172931671143,0,True,False,False

He makes games that make players go ""One more turn"" and next thing you know, its 3 in the morning and you realize that your not in your 20's anymore

Removing any bias of Comic book/Movie preference ,the core competency of the game is very entertaining to make it distinguishable enough from the XCOM franchise. The Deck Mechanic with the Heroism resource fueling bigger plays allows enough for casual players to get by and hardcore Trading card game players to build somewhat broken and full of synergy decks. Power creep is very real in this game. Early game, you feel a massive power disparity vs as you get higher level and unlock new cards. Combat offers enough variety in enemies and their tactics where you really will think about how to approach future missions.

When your outside of combat, I'm going to be contrary to many of my peers on Steam, it often feels like a chore. Don't get me wrong, there is ALOT to do. Like Researching new things, upgrading your room, Upgrading ability cards, Sparing with other heroes, buy gifts. Etc. At first, it won't feel repetitive, but by Act 2, your sort of just trying to push through ANOTHER cut scene or another hangout or another reminder to do extra stuff in the abbey so you can get back to the tactical gameplay. So positive to people who do want a decent retelling of the Midnight Suns Comic run, but negative for people who don't have hours to dedicate to side stuff anymore

I've heard alot of people on youtube compare the Friend system to the Fire Emblem/JRPG Friend simulator approach, but there is  a very clear approach that every hero thinks you (The Hunter) is the BEST and they all want to be your friend. Sometimes it takes you out of the game when some of the more Gruffier characters are like ""Let's hangout by the pool"". I believe the intent is to build the sort of relationship attachments one might experience in Knights of the Old Republic or Mass effect, but it feels really forced and almost Fan Fiction style approach to the protagonist.

Hero Selection is very diverse and will fill the need for most fan service or mild passive awareness of the Marvel IP. Some hero's clearly are well themed to their lore, and play well. Some however can end up being very situational and or a detriment to the end game.

In my current play-through (Have not hit New Game Plus) I've had a multitude of Asset breaks, Frame drops, and even texture's disappearing. The Texture issues were the most prevalent and happens while traveling around the abbey, while in the GUI and even in combat. For the amount of attention to systems and subsystems the game dev's have attempted to provide, it suffers from the modern Triple A Approach of ""Could use some more polish, but it's stable enough to push"".

The game is a good time despite my negative observations. The core of the game fills the need for Tactical Combat. I would agree with some of the other reviews, 60 dollars for this game is ALOT for release build. You can probably wait for it to drop to Sale price and or specials before giving it a proper play.

I initially put off purchasing the game due to the card based battle mechanics.  I then snagged it with the season pass bundle at a discount out of boredom and a fairly substantial addition to Steam sales and do not regret my purchase.  Surprisingly, I really enjoy the card based battle style and recommend giving it a shot.  Plus, there's a tons to do in the game beyond the battles including exploration, amusing and interesting character development, etc. I haven't had a single crash or issue on my gaming laptop even when hooked to an external curved display.  The game plays flawlessly and is gorgeous... except on Steam Deck, read below if this applies to you.

Steam Deck Warning: I initially devoted over 30 hours on my Steam Deck and do not recommend it for Steam Deck at the time of this review.  The game crashes repeatedly when the main character goes to bed and randomly at other points during the game, particularly during load screens that accompany cut scenes. Keep in mind, the game is literally progressed by the main character going to bed after each battle.  This means dozens of crashes/soft resets on your Steam Deck each time you sit down to play it.  Character goes to bed, game crashes and reboots Steam Deck, slug through the game reloading and then the character successfully goes to sleep and you can play until you complete the next battle, go to sleep and repeat.  This sounds awful and it is, but it gets worse. Fairly late in the game there is a triple cut scene that causes a game breaking bug that the normal reboot does resolve.  I tried tons of different tricks listed in the forums without success including a lack of cloud saves.  The Steam Deck indicates cloud saves work, but you'll find nothing on your PC.  This is another known Steam Deck issue and none of the forum tricks worked for me.  The fact that I brute forced my way through 30+ hours on the Steam Deck while dealing with dozens if not hundreds of reboots and then finally had to completely restart my campaign on my laptop ramping up 97+ hours at the time of this review should prove how much I thoroughly enjoy the game.",1674742979,1674742979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First there are 2 major questions we are going to answer right away. 1) Is this game worth 60$ and the answer is yes, the combat works incredibly well and the rest of the game is well made and long enough to justify the price with anywhere from 50-100+ hours of game play. The second question, is this a card game, and the answer is not exactly. Defining this game as a card game is like saying CoD/Modern Warfare games are games about collecting guns or that Xcom games are shooters. Yes cards are a part of the game, but they are used more as a part of a much greater whole. 
  The combat in Midnight Suns works well, flows smoothly and the movement rules combined with the cards allows for deep tactical combat that feels fun and exciting. The different mechanics around collecting resources and customizing cards allows for customization and interesting choices for the different heroes. 
  The part of the game outside the combat works but it feels like it stumbles a little. As far as writing and story telling the game feels like a comic book in video game form. Whether you enjoy this or not is going to come down to personal preference, because they aimed for the comic book feel it does mean you have to deal with comic book tropes. In addition it is easy to tell this is Firaxis’s first try at telling a story in this style, as the pacing can feel a bit awkward and you have to deal with some mechanics/story separation. The abbey is your home base, and while a vast area to explore still feels a bit empty and lacking of life, in addition the FoV is known to cause emotion sickness in some players for the open exploration view. 
  Overall if you’re a fan of tactical games, card games, or any combination of the 2 this game is worth a look/try. If your curious about either one I would also recommend this game as with the variable difficulty it allows anyone to dig into the game no matter how good or bad they are. However as always there is nothing wrong with waiting for a sale to the game fits into your budget.

The UI is well thought out and you can save games/load games for when things don't work out like you thought they would.  This happens sometimes because interactions can get complicated and there is no ""grid"" on the play field so you might not get that AOE just like you thought..

What made me hesitate briefly is when he said it's also part card game and you have your own created character. I'm not the biggest fan of deck builders outside of Yugioh and I thought the idea of creating your own character in a game like this was cringe. 

Boy, was I wrong. Dead wrong. 

This is easily my favorite game of the year so far. Yeah, it's got some bugs here and there and the writing is kind of cheesy, but it has this charm to it that hits all of my nerdy needs. The gameplay is fun as hell and although the missions get repetitive, I've never found myself bored or wishing there was more (except for characters, which are coming). All the characters have their own playstyle that can be slightly altered with certain deck builds. Getting cards isn't a pain in the ass and they're not super complex. The animations are also cool as hell and the amount of cosmetics that you can all get in game are pretty good too. I bought the legendary edition and never looked back 60 hours later. 

I would recommend disabling 2K launcher tho. I had a lot of performance issues before I did that and afterwards the issues significantly dropped. I think due to personal hardware issues I have with some storage devices I'm still experiencing some performance issues, but they're not very noticeable and the ones that are go away fairly quickly on their own.

Your home base is filled with interactions to get to know your team better as well as make them better in missions.

However, it is not without its problems. It runs like butt if you use the 2k launcher. Disable that and you are pretty smooth sailing outside the occasional crash. However, technical issues aside, the story is okay with some really badly written dialogue. I felt like some of it was written by an AI who looked through a few comic books.

Pros:
-Combat is fun and challenging. The card system is very innovative and was definitely a design risk but it's well implemented and works great, so it's paid off.

-An engaging story that can make you emotional at the end. Great writing all over the game.
-The Hunter is a great character, on par with some of the best Marvel heroes.
-Superb voice acting with all characters behaving and acting like their counterparts from the comics and films.
-If you like the Marvel universe then all the side quests and levelling up friendship with different characters will be fun. You'll enjoy pretty much every dialogue in the game

Cons:
-Like other similar games (Xcom style tRGPs) at some point you are going to see the same enemies over and over. Luckily, every fight has different objectives and the wide hero roster will make encounters feel less repetitive.

I think this is a game made by marvel fans. Everyone is not a background character and you can go as deep into their lore as you like, bond with them to learn more. They all feel like they should. All playing like they should and act like they should. If you like anyone in this roster, you are going to be surprised how much writing they put into them. You will learn something about everyone here and outside just lore dump, you get to see them all interact with each other like real people and not like a super hero movie. Its a dorm full of all these hero's with their masks off and you can see everyone get on each other's nerves and make friends with each other. Its very charming how much of a real person they make everyone seem. Its also optional too if you dont want to waste your time on the writing and just want the gameplay and main story.

The gameplay is pretty solid. Its turn based ""everyone on your team acts"" and then your opponent does the same. The actions you can do on your turn is based on the cards you draw. Oh by the way, its a card game too. Everyone feels powerful and their animations are beautiful. Its a wet dream for a nerd to see their hero's fight together like this.

For a marvel fan, its a must if you like to interact with these hero's like never before in a marvel medium. If you just want the cool looking combat, I recommend.

If you are not a marvel fan but interested in getting into it, I recommend it. Like I mentioned previously, you get to learn the lore of everyone and their personalities. Its charming and the gameplay is fun to watch.

If you are not a marvel fan and not interested in learning about marvel. Its an above average game. writing is competent and sometimes even compelling.

Engaging, re-playable, and gorgeous combat that makes you want to show your friends these badass moves. You can tell a huge amount of love was put into this game, not just the genuinely fresh approach to combat, but everything else around it.

All the conversations and dialogues with your super-peers is voiced excellently, written well, and sometimes a genuine treat.

Pro's:
- Turn based combat is very fun, has great animations, and has enjoyable complexity with each fight.
- You can unlock new costumes with your team and new dialogue/backstories the further you progress the individual friendship ranks.
- There is a light/dark side system that adds further builds to the main character & changes some of the dialogue options (doesn't change the story though).
- There is an open world that gives you rewards and further side story info; some of which can be used with the upgrade system.
- The upgrade system lets you improve cards, get new cards, improve the base (for many benefits, and do individual things like gifts for friendship, training lower level hero's, or decorating your base.
- The auto save functionality is VERY good even to the point where it will save every turn.

Cons:
- Game has terrible performance and you MUST disable the EA launcher to even have a shot at running it.
- Even with disabling the EA launcher; if there are a lot of enemies on the map the game becomes unplayable and will often crash.
- There are atleast two characters that aren't unlocked until the game is just about over ... which is dissapointing.
- Biased opinion but I thought the ""caretaker"" was the most boring uninteresting person ever and they didnt really explain a lot of the backstory with why she exists or what happened to the hunter the first time around.",1674491674,1674491674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Anything marvel based
- Turn based tactical combat (like XCOM but without the BS hit %)
- Cringe/cheesy dialogue in games that doesn't take itself too seriously
- Crafting mechanics that are actually meaningful
- Actual decent character interactions and world building
- Extra world building outside just doing missions; abbey exploration etc.

Here are some, I would say, cons to this game:

- Premium currency for cosmetics... 
- Game performance (as noted in several other reviews you need to disable the 2k launcher) but after a while of playing my game gets incredibly buggy and I need to reboot to make it normal again
- Missions are all kinda samey but It's hard to have a lot of diversity in this kind of game I feel
- Starting NG+ wipes all your cards you worked hard creating/obtaining, kind of makes sense and kinda doesn't, to me it makes it feel like wasted effort 

Here's an additional point that you can decide is good or bad:

- Extra content being actively developed/added via Season pass/DLC mechanics.

For me, I am a big marvel fan so new characters to play etc. will always be a driver for wanting to play the game but some people don't like it.  Asfaik the story does end with the current content of the game, the extra stuff is just additional content to help you have more fun after playing the game.

So this game combines a few different elements together to create a compelling and cohesive whole, and by all accounts is what Marvels The Avengers game should've been. I know that Action RPGs are more in vogue than turn based RPGs, but I hope that changes soon.

So the game is LONG, first of all. While not a JRPG, it borrows a lot of elements from that genre, for better and for worse. The main issues I have are how long it takes to get going, and how grindy some elements are, which causes a bit of narrative dissonance, as the urgency of the main plot doesn't quite line up with the way the game expects you to play.

That isn't all bad though. The game takes a while to get going, but in return, it doesn't give you everything at once, and introduces new mechanics quite late into it. Another good element is the character focus. While the main player character is a new addition, all the other characters are from Marvel Comics, and are very well written. There is a friendship mechanic that is similar to the one present in the Persona games, where you are encouraged to hang out with different heroes, give them gifts, and in return they will perform better in battles. 

There are a total of 15 playable characters (The main PC, and the 14 Marvel Superheroes) and more coming in DLC. I've only unlocked 9 of the 14 characters around 22 hours in at the time of writing (might be misleading, some of that time was AFK). Each of these characters has a different deck of cards, and different personalities and dialogue choices.

The player character also has a Light vs Darkness mechanic, where some of their abilities are tied to their moral compass. The game, however, encourages you to be pretty balanced. It isn't good or evil, more like nice vs edgy. Some of the other characters respond better to niceness, while others respond better to edginess. If you say a nice thing, you get a Light point, and if you get enough of those you get more chances to unlock light abilities. Same for the opposite. Saying something in the middle won't give you any points in either direction of light vs dark, but might still be the best choice for whoever you are talking to, and may give relationship points for that character in return.

All in all, this is a game that is surprisingly mechanically deep, and not at all as casual as it might look on the onset. 

Also Nico and Magik are hot",1674467990,1674467990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ever since I did that, I have not come across any bugs or glitches--outside of just normal jank you could expect from this type of game. 

TL;DR buy it on sale. I cannot stress enough that this is the MOST generic version of a 2k/Marvel crossover game you can think of and at no point does this game try to do more than that. 

Am I saying this game is a masterpiece? Absolutely not. Is it giving me WAY more enjoyment than I should be having? Absolutely. I spent 2 hours on night 25 (and I specify that this is JUST the nighttime and not including the morning/combat mission) exploring the Abbey and I've done that on multiple occasions and I will continue to do so because I find it enjoyable. There is a cat that you will never be able to see--which is why I suspect they made the cat Meow when you get close--and hunting that cat down to pet it has, again, given me much more enjoyment than I definitely should've gotten from this game. This game is at like, the perfect level of jankiness to the point that I can shut my brain off and skip dialogue when I want to (because most of the dialogue is sorta meh) and start paying attention to the moments that interest me.

This game is easy and then it gets exponentially harder as you go up in difficulty, which easily caters to a broad range of casual-to-hardcore gamers. Also, this game does not add anything substantial to the comics that the comics and movies did not already provide. It does not try to add onto the characters and they will react exactly how you think they'd react. Do not get your hopes up because you will only let yourself down. You are not here to experience multi-dimensional characters and tense plot twists that make your heart drop. You will not be here to cry to sad moments or feel anger at betrayal. You are here to watch Captain Marvel shoot a laser beam and be in a book club; Blade look cool with a sword and pick mushrooms with you; Iron Man to rain down a hail of rockets and make paintings overlooking a cliffside; Magik open portals (and also listen to her stories?

Think XCOM combat, Slay the Spire card mechanics, Bioware's Mass Effect/ Dragon Age hub and relationship mechanics with all the aforementioned hitting marks in inspiration not in execution, and wrapped in a similar yet moderately updated skin to that of the most Current Marvel Ultimate Alliance game.
With that being said, the character models are passable except with many of the faces being outright weird looking. The facial animations and textures in game look dated compared to most games coming out right now. Oddly enough this game gives you several ways to activate photo mode which makes it seem as though they expected this game to be visually impressive at least at the time of planning the photo mode feature. It's not all bad though, oddly some of the character models and faces do look relatively good which makes it all the more obvious when they do not. The plot has been interesting so far and carried well enough by the voice cast that I expect anyone satisfied with the voice acting in the last ultimate alliance game would be equally happy here with the similarly implemented MCU style banter and Tony Stark's voice actor doing their interpretation of RDJ's version. The game mechanics in combat have been down right addicting so far. While they have moved away from XCOM's cover and overwatch mechanics and have a comparatively simplified system, they have exceeded expectations in terms of combat animations, fx, and have created an incredibly satisfying ping-pong, pool-esque element to the game where the player effectively uses combatants and debris as ricocheting projectiles that inflict damage as they collide. There has been the expected amount of Marvel fanfare, and easter eggs for those who enjoy going off of the beaten path in terms of dialogue options, and actual exploration. A decent amount of unlockables have been noted so far in-game such as new characters, abilities, causal wear, and combat wear with the latter two being purely cosmetic. I would like to see more types of buff, debuffs, and status effects used in combat but I feel as though there is the potential for them to be introduced further in the story than I have seen currently. Also, this game hits the gpu hard for what it is! I was hitting 99% usage on my 3080 even with some of the settings reduced.

Who is the target audience for this game?
People who like Marvel and turn-based strategy games.

Is this game Marvel XCOM?
No, this game is Marvel Fire Emblem

If you don't like one of the above I can't recommend this game to you.

The first 4-5 hours of this game are pretty slow. After that, when it opens up it gets really good. This game has **a lot** of dialog.

The combat and overall character customization is pretty good not only for your character but for the other characters as well. Choosing each character's ability set gives you a lot of options.

Gameplay was just challenging enough for me where I didn't feel like I could just breeze through it, but had to make some timely decisions and tactical planning. The use of character positioning, utilizing environmental hazards, understanding what the different heroes do all played into an extremely fun gaming experience that I could enjoy at my leisure. Most games punish you for needing to step away or pause; Marvel's Midnight Suns has the perfect mix of action and story-telling, with the majority of the ""combat"" being turn-based card plays which translate into your heroes performing actions on the battle field. Missions could take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour, with the Final Mission taking maybe 90 minutes for me to complete.

All-in-all, highly recommended. Explores story telling through conversations between your character, The Hunter, and all the characters involved in the story at the 'Abbey'. Encourages the player to explore the Abbey grounds and unlock new cosmetics/abilities/story. Skins are pretty cool, too, but the major draw for me was the fun trying different hero combos to see which ones I thought synergized the best.

Couple times my fairly decent PC would struggle with the processing of the combat scenes, particularly noticeable on the last missions where I had to re-load an auto save because my character got stunned and had no way to break out of it to activate the last card. Re-loaded and boom, it was so smooth all of a sudden after being choppy and laggy for the majority of the Final Mission.

Great story that explores themes of friendship, love, and duty. Be warned though, you have to get to know the heroes to understand which conversation style, gifts, and settings they enjoy most. Although if you want, you don't have to hang out or talk to any of them, and keep just cranking out missions, which rotate along with the main story mission. Will jump back on the New Game+ mode once Deadpool comes out later this month.

I bought this game because I loved xcom and I support firaxis. So I went into the game just wanting to play the tactics portion and skipped story.... till 15 hrs later i found out I was playing it wrong. 

So I restarted and looked through the story, did exploration in the Abbey and talk to the characters etc. It started to grow on me and I find the story is pretty ok. I mean 88 hours and I am not finished with my first playthrough lol. 

Once you had your fill with you chunk of story, yea you can just play the tactics portion and grind / farm. 

I bought legendary edition and I would say it is worth it. The costumes are of high quality and there are some dyes which can change colors of costumes etc. Best of all the midnight suns costumes which is available in-game (non purchase. need friendship lvl 5 sorta grind to unlock) LOOKS awesome! Worth the grind.

This game is not like xcom. Took me awhile to figure out what hero does what. 

Example Main DPS - Iron Man, Ghost rider
Tanks - Captain America , Wolverine, Captain Marvel
Support Healer - Hunter, Nico, Dr Strange

Once you figure that out, you can make amazing teams! and how you deck your character, they will also play differently. 

And the first DLC ad is already out. Overall, i'd say this game is not a failure.

That said, the downside to the PC version somehow, I run on medium graphics on gtx 3060, does'nt run as smoothly as I wished :( and sometimes graphic bug and i get them minecraft graphics. Doesnt bother me, I just restart the game. Overall the positives outweigh this small negative annoyance which I hope the devs will fix.

Lilith as a villain is a great call as she is THE established villain from the 90's Midnight Sons run in the comics.  The writers tie together her history and that of your core character, Hunter, nicely.  Plus, we get to see Marvel mix their magic and their science in crazy cool ways, as Hydra is corrupted by Lilith into servitude as well as other major characters.
Game play is a solid mix of combat and exploring a small, open world base with surrounding land to search for widgets, side quests and collectibles. 

Combat is by far my favorite aspect of the game as you mix and match characters into 3 hero teams and use each deck of combat cards shuffled together to eliminate the enemy and achieve your goals.  Using combinations of card play to gain Heroic Power to spend on bigger cards, or manipulating your environment for extra attacks, is an amazing puzzle in efficiently doing to most damage you can before giving up your turn.   Kudos on the combat animations too.  I really get that superhero feel with how the battle is visualized. 
I really like almost everything about this game.  

My only complaint is an excessive amount of conversation with the other characters in the game.  Building friendships is key to combat bonuses, but between that, the story dialogue from multiple points of view and the side quests... it is more gab then I am used to in a game, so I tend to skip a lot of it when I am anxious to battle.

The humor is great whether you're familiar with these characters or not. 
The characters themselves are also well written, they all feel like the characters they're supposed to be and not just caricatures of them. 
The amount of characters in the game is also great, as long as it isn't too obscure you're probably going to find some of your favorite characters here. 
The gameplay itself is also well done and all the characters are fittingly thematic to how they are treated inside with the card-game mechanics. 


And the bad, but it's more due to preference than anything actually bad. 
It's done by the XCOM devs, which are fantastic at what they do, but have a tendency to make games very difficult where every individual fight is equally difficult and taxing on you. This is great for most people, but me personally I don't like games like XCOM or Divinity: Original Sin where every fight is supposed to be extremely deadly. I don't like how it doesn't let me make character build choices simply because it's cool and fun rather than because of how effective it is. Especially in this Marvel game, I would want to use all my favorite characters in a team together rather than have to take characters I don't like for mechanical reasons. This isn't helped by the fact that I'm just not very good at strategy and tactics game, but again that's not the game's fault, it's just a miss-match in tastes. I would personally enjoy a difficulty option lower than Normal that would let me play the game in a more chill form that I'd enjoy, but I also recognize that I'm not necessarily the game's target audience in the first place.

Based on game description and community engagement leading up to release, it had been on my wishlist for months (if not year(s)?). I enjoy tactical turn based combat (xcom, div2), card games (slay the spire, monster train) and enjoy the Marvel/comic IP. I figured it'd be a home run, but having learned my lesson on previous launch day purchases decided to wait and read reviews first. So here are my concerns and reactions:

1. In game currency, DLC, battle chest, money grab, P2W angle. The reviews heavily indicated the ridiculous in-game currency required for purchasing in-game components. Ultimately, yes, this is a thing. In my 40h so far (progressed story about 6ish? core/story missions), I've only encountered specific items that ultimately cost real money (via in game currency). These components are the ""super cool"" variant outfits worn in combat. All other 'ingame currencies' that purchase items (gloss, essence, etc) are acquired by completing missions and exploring the grounds. I believe you can purchase some of these in game currencies with real money; but the 'super cool' suits are definitely locked behind a paywall. As far as I can tell, they have absolutely no bearing on gameplay or cinematics. 90% of variant/custom suits/clothing can be acquired with in-game grinding. I personally don't mind this model, I feel reassured content and support will continue for a game I enjoy with these purchases. I haven't spent any money outside purchase price (and don't intend to) and don't feel as if I'm at a disadvantage or turned off. If this model bothers you, then you will likely be bothered when you come across it in game.

2. Cringey dialogue. This comes up in reviews quite a bit, and I had already formed my personal concern long before release during the dev showcases. They genuinely got very giddy at very cringey dialogue I had thought was borderline satire; but they would comment ""that is so cool!"" and I realized nobody was in on the joke with me. So, yes, there is cringey dialogue and probably a lot of it- but I actually lost track. The immersion in this game is so powerful that I didn't realize until recently I hadn't minded sitting back and watching the character interactions and conversations. I cannot recall any portions I'd laughed at or rolled my eyes. I think there is a difference between watching as an audience and participating as a player. I let myself get lost in the world and enjoy the silly banter. I get that may not be for everyone.

3. Immersion/side quests. At least one review downvoted the game to sheer non-main-game-gameplay (/words...). That reviewer is absolutely correct in their assesment. Depending on the type of player you are, there is a lot of time devoted to building relationships, exploring abbey grounds, reading lore and engaging in drawn out conversations with some ""drama"". From my understanding, you are able to experience everything the game has to offer by skipping almost all of these items. However, there are handicaps that come with that as your relationships and recipes discovered on abbey grounds (amongst others) do impact combat. I wouldn't call it significant, but it's certainly greater than nothing. I have not found this distracting, in fact, I'm often enjoying the respite from combat and look forward to uncovering another clue to the Salem witches. I've probably spent 3/4 of my playtime on non-main-game-gameplay (it's gonna be a real word now), and have thoroughly enjoyed that time. As someone who gets impatient at wasting time and just watching a movie vs playing a game, I can suggest if you're on the fence, you're probably going to enjoy the ride. This should be a non issue for almost of all us; but there is a lot of non-main-game-gameplay. A lot.

4. RNG. This just comes with the territory. Conclusively, they've done a good job and it's balanced well enough (base decks, acquiring cards, drawing cards, enemy actions, etc). All attacks always hit so that eliminates my xcom rage quit tendencies. They also do a good job reminding players of effects, persistance implications, and potentially bad moves (this enemy cannot be knockbacked), as well as other areas. There is still RNG and I've restarted more than one mission due to a misunderstanding of my actions. I personally think the 'difficulty' slider is excellent. You gradually unlock increased difficulty (with even greater increased rewards). You can slide up and down at your convenience. I'm probably more of a casual than hardcore gamer myself and find myself maxing the slider on 'easy' missions and pulling it down for 'hard' missions.

Bottom line, I really can't find anything significant to complain about. I'm sure I could nit-pick some items, but the game flows so smoothly it's swept under the carpet quickly. This is a GREAT game and unless one of the above reasons is strong enough of a detractor to turn you off; buy this game with full confidence.

So I was really exited about this game. I wanted to wait till I get some reviews but after the hype it received on its opening day, I decided to spend money on it and  It started off so well. 

[h1]Positives: [/h1]

The game combat is exiting. I always hated missing 95% shots in xcom so this was a welcome change. If you are tactical in grouping your cards then your shots will always do the damage they intended. Having random cards makes the combat a lot of fun.

Friendship with other heroes is nice. I wish there was some romance involved. There was hint of it with Blade and Captain Marvel but I really loved Hunter has romance mechanic. Sure it wont be Marvel Universe accurate but it's just a video game.

Things to do i Abbe is OK. Nothing special

And there ends the positives.

[h1]Negatives: [/h1]

The biggest negative in the game is it's highly unbalanced. XCOM was the same. Early game was tough and in late game you can roll over everyone. XCOM was still manageable but this game is uplayable early on higher difficulties. What you end up doing is a lot of easy side missions just for leveling up sake so that you wont get one shot killed by a sniper who can conceal and has ton of health. And it becomes boring after a while. In XCOM you were emotionally involved in player character/skill building but in this game you already know what exactly each player skill will do so there is no emotional attachment. 

Apart from a few annoying enemies who are there to just annoy players with over use of frenzy, daze or stun, there is not much enemy variety. 

XCOM randomness still haunts this game. I have two make them bleed card with blade. Either both of them appear at the same time or none of them appear for while which makes certain characters like blade useless depending on the cards drawn and since the first turn is the most important one esp. on higher difficulty so you are set for failure from the start.

The whole plot is a dud. Finished the whole campaign but still couldn't understand why lillith wanted cathon back in the first place. There must be some marvel comics that explains better but the game does a very poor job of it.

You get hulk very late in the game. The most fun character of the rooster and there is just one final mission to do with him. nothing else. or as I said earlier you just do some side missions just for sake of it.

Even though there is friendship mechanic, there is nothing special about it. After one play I just right click through conversaions just to get through them. There is no replayability to these conversations so you just keep right clicking them to get over them.

[h1]Summary[/h1]

This game def has potential but I am afraid only mods can make it more fun. Not sure how much marvel will allow but my worry is it will be no way near XCOM which as amazing modding support.

Logan is only about 5'3 in the comics. which is weird because in the promotional images he is apparently about that height.

These are large shoes to fill for them, as both are outstanding games, the latter being one of my all-time favourite games. So did they succeed in creating a card-based tactics game with marvel characters? For the most part yes, but with some caveats.

First I will briefly talk about the technical state of the game as its not my forte. The game for the most part runs and kind of looks like ""slight ass"". Technically my pc cant run the highest settings on everything, but for the most part I had mesh and texture detail and a few other settings up to high quality, as lets be honest, nobody cares about view distance and dumb shit like that in a tactics game. I had a decent amount of stutter, and slight lag - nothing game-breaking or super distracting, as it was usually in cut scenes or in the abbey section of the game, but it would occasionally lag during card animations and be a bit off putting, but nothing that affected game play. I had one crash which is honestly expected for a firaxis game as XCOM 2 wasn't that stable on release either. The biggest issue i had was enemies or heros glitching through floors in combat, making it difficult to target them or being very odd watching an invisible model attacking an enemy. There was some occasional other minor stuff, like one time an enemy doing an actual T-pose after i killed them giving me a good laugh, but all in all most of this i could play through and may (or may not) be patched out, and didn't impact my experience enough to make my experience less enjoyable.

Next to gameplay. Now I'm a bit of a digital card game whore and a big enjoyer of XCOM 2, and for the most part Midnight Suns does a good job of melding those two styles of game into one with a unique Marvel twist on it. However i think personally the game ways far too overdeveloped in some gameplay aspects and not as much in others. There is far too many collectable fluff and focus on random additions like every hero having their own stats that can be leveled up and arcane knowledge and collectable hunts around the abbey and the abbey grounds and so on so forth, that it subtracts away from the creativity to make cool and unique cards and making heros feeling a lot more special than they already are. For example Blade is one of the first heros you get, and he is focused on applying bleed on multiple targets or high damage to take out one higher priority one, however one card he has lets the next two apply bleed, and only one higher rarity card capitalises on it. There is a few other cards in his kit like a chain strike (attacking multiple enemies) and some lifesteal and high damage stuff, but this becomes a problem when you realise the few amount of cards most heros have which makes a lot of characters start to feel quite similar. I think it is a combination of the gameplay framework not really allowing for more creativity to design unique stuff but also a lack of developer creativity in card and hero passives that hurts the game in a long run. Iron man and Magik were the most unique feeling to me as Iron man spending redraws to make his cards stronger, and Magiks unparralled control of the battlefield with portals and teleportation made them really fun to use. I think they needed to go deeper and not be afraid to make kits more complex and unique from one another: make more hero passives, make more cards, make more effects the cards do, more attack types, make more card leveling and customisation, because as of writing this, getting a legendary card pack and its filled with 5 cards you have gotten 3 times in a row before is not very entertaining or rewarding. Credit where its due though, is that the mod system for cards is really cool, and for the most part leveling a card up felt like a big power improvement usually for a new effect, and not because the numbers got higher (though there are a few of those). There is also a severe lack of enemy variety too which is really strange considering most aliens from XCOM were very unique and requqired you to change up your tactics, especially if an andromadon or sectopod or gatekeeper or so on showed up. Overall i think the game is good if you just focus on trying to finish the game, as there is little replayability in the gameplay unlike XCOM.

Finally to the story of the game and yeah its pretty bad and corny and cringy at times, but to me it became quite lovably cringe and it grew on me. As i continued to play the game i came to enjoy all the characters quite a lot. Its got a lot of MCU in there but to me it feels much closer to the comics which are, if we are being honest yet again, pretty corny and silly. Theres so much truly bat shit dialouge for both in and out of combat that i cant help but laugh at it but also kind of love it. Watching heros interact with each other and slowly bond together in a natural way was a really enjoyable part of the game and probably one of the fondest parts of my time playing. For every Blade saying ""your mother"" or the hunter saying ""Blade told me to mention your mother. Apparently shes promiscuous?"" there is a Tony Stark pushing past his ego to fix a bond or Magik opening up about her insecurities and starting to trust the team more. It starts out corny dumb and slightly forced, but develops into quite a nice spot to where i wouldn't mind another game with these characters

All in all a mostly enjoyable game, flawed, yet enjoyable, however i dont think its worth the full price and even the discounted 20 percent off i got it at is still probably too much for the game. Definitly a wait for a sale type deal. A mostly fun time with some enjoyable but limited card gameplay and some actually bad but also great writing. The remminicent tactical gameplay really just made me want to play XCOM 2 again and made me hope yet again for an XCOM 3 that was jsut XCOM 2 but even better

Story: I rather enjoyed the story.  It’s so that they went with an Elder Gods line and delved deep into the occult side of Marvel world.  Pacing was good and they way things played out, it kept you guessing for awhile but eventually I saw the plot.  Though, even then I was rather enjoying it still.  Feels rather good but not worth a second play through till DLC comes out.  It can feel a little CW-ish often.  But like first season CW so you can tolerate it once.

Characters: Good roster and set of characters.  They interact well though there some that make no sense to have there and there are some that whine soo badly, I kept hoping they would die in the story.  Sadly, no.  Tony Stark looks like Freddie Mercury, hated it at first but eventually, it grew on me.  Nico I wanted to hold her head under water till the bubbles stopped.  Once again, each character feels like someone was watching a CW character and wanted to emulate it.  For the good and the bad of that, it does feel like it.

Combat System: I hated this.  I would rather have been dealing a 90% chance in X-COM than dealing with this terrible card system.  First problem, there is not a practice room to test out cards and see how they work.  There is the threat room, but there is no control of how enemies act in it so you are in live combat.  This becomes a pain in the butt cause you don’t get a chance to test out decks unless you go into live fire.  So if you want to test out a supportive deck, you’ll get murdered fast before seeing how it works again dummies.  The card system also feels worse that X-COMs aiming chances.  It will turn battles ranked as easy to hard and hard battles to trivial.  It’s terrible.  There is not pacing or balance to it.  You have three types of cards, pretty easy to handle them but sometimes you will go turns pulling cards you can not use at all.  What do I mean by that?  If you pull a card that requires Heroism, a in combat resource that builds during combat, and you don’t have enough it’s useless.  So you’d think to put in more cards that generate Heroism to offset this?  Well, even making decks with 50% cards that generate it and 50% that use it, I would still pull for turns with either pulling only cards that generate it, which will still win you combat, but also rounds of pulling just those cards I can’t use.  Something felt so out of balance at times because it’s so random.  Painfully random.  I would recommend looking up a deck building guide and follow it for a while till you find what you like, since the game does not give you a chance to practice.

Combat also has environmental objects that you can use to help damage the enemies, at the expense of Heroism.  These are rather fun but never enough.  Really, they should refresh after a few rounds so you can enjoy that enviromental fun.  It really makes combat fun and more tolerable.

The effect of the cards is fun, if you pull one you can use.

Pluses: Combat, combat combat. The arenas are small and the enemy variety could use a bump,  but bringing different team and deck comps on every mission is endlessly challenging. Deck management, upgrading, mixing and matching is very engaging. You can also set the difficulty as high or as low as you like. The story is good, and the cut scenes and animations are great.

Minuses: Bugs (graphical glitches, and I saw two hard crashes in 90 hours of gameplay), the social side can drag on a bit and some heroes are much more interesting and engaging that others, and the Abbey exploration is mediocre verging on bad. Cosmetic skins are mostly junk and could have been much better.

Gameplay - It's got a great storyline. I'm only 36 hours in and I feel like the story just keeps going. The fact that I can go at my own pace and disregard the main ""Story Missions"" to work on leveling up my heroes is nice. One big downfall is the voice acting not quite hitting the tone I want it to compared to the Marvel Movie actors. Tony Stark, for example, has a voice actor I'm not really into. It's too.... whiney. The world is small to explore, but it's got alot of secret puzzles to solve. I give the gameplay 8/10

Difficulty - It's pretty easy. I think i lost against Venom once but managed to figure out his tactics the second time around. Although I play on normal mode atm. The secrets and world map can get confusing as the puzzles don't really give any good hints. You just gotta figure it all out on your own. Card building takes some time to figure out as well, but after you get the hang of it, it's just a matter of resource management. Obtaining resources is a lengthy process though. Alot of running around and collecting daily, or taking on random missions to obtain the resources. It's pretty safe to say the difficulty imo is a 7/10. With 10 being super hard.

Note: This game is almost unplayable until you disable the launcher for the game and adjust the settings to pretty much minimum. Loading times are still insane and huge attack moves can freeze the game for a few seconds. This game isn't optimized for crap. The dev's need to focus all their attention on optimization before launching more content. But I do see it being a solid running game in the future. :)

Overall, with everything this game has to offer, I would give it a 7.5/10. With potential to be a solid 9.",1674258158,1674258158,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game was recommended to me as a ""love letter to the source material."" I found it was more of a suicide note.

LIKES:
* Firaxis managed to reinvent their formula - it isn't necessarily better or more entertaining than their previous one, but it's an achievement in itself.
* There's a reward-heavy macro loop that gives you lots of opportunities to create different character builds and test them out in the world. 

This, and the morbid curiosity to see if this trainwreck is going anywhere, were the only things that kept me going for so long.

DISLIKES:
* Hours of meaningless banter and inane side quests that keep you from actual tactical combat.
* Less variety in enemy archetypes and squad mixes than in e.g. XCOM 2 (at least it felt that way)
* Lack of pre-mission intel and lack of deck control in combat that limit strategic planning.
* Horrible navigation in non-combat areas.
* Horrible writing.
* Character building full of melodrama that resolves itself without any input from your character.
* In fact, your character progresses the story in no way, other than you clicking through the story missions.
* Slogging campaign. I thought I was finishing when it announced that I arrived at ""part two"".
* Severe gameplay and story segregation (e.g. Wolverine heals quickly in cutscenes but doesn't have any regen options in combat).
* Inconsistent world-building.
* Horrible character art.
* Bland customization options.
* Horrible facial animation.
* Bland UI art.
* Performance and stability issues.
* Obligatory launch through the 2K launch client.
* And more.

CONCLUSIONS

Honestly, it looks like a group of experienced devs abandoned the project in the middle of pre-production and let junior staff fill in the rest. The game comes apart everywhere you look, and I wouldn't call it a AAA production. 
* Get it on sale if you love turn-based tactical combat so much, you don't care about anything else that makes up a game.
* If you want a more balanced tactical experience, look for alternatives in the indie space.
* If you want a fun superhero story, play Guardians of the Galaxy.",1674223938,1674223938,False,2,0,0.521288812160491943,0,True,False,False

I would recomment this game, BUT... 

1. You need to have a tolerance for cheesy and often straight cringy dialogue options. It mixes Marvel superheroes with character traits straight out of a highschool teenie drama movie. It's so bad that often it becomes accidentally funny. 
2. You need to be okay with performance drops. Most of the time the game runs great for me, but frame drops are part of the experience here. 
3. The last third of the game has a noticeable increase in bugs and performance decrease. 

When you can get past these points, you get rewarded with an awesome gameplay loop consisting of building your deck and strategizing in fights. The combat in my opinion is best described by a mix of Slay The Spire and XCOM. It may sound odd at first (at least it did to me), but I enjoy it more than I would've thought at first. 
The heroes feel noteably different and have their own strengths and weaknesses. The mission objectives vary enough, so you can't get in your ""comfortable lazy loop"", you need to think about the objective and how to best accomplish it with what you got on your hands. At least it's that way if you increase your difficulty, playing on Heroic II currently.

I have spent a lot of hours on this game trying to get all heroes at max friendship level to get access to their midnight sun outfits and special abilities. First and foremost, this is a fun game and definitely a nice mesh of tactics from Xcom and flashy Marvel moves/characters. It almost feels like a puzzle sometimes when you think you got a bad hand of cards, then you start using everything you've learned to make it out on top. I love creating some interesting combinations with characters and upgrading cards. 

My issues with this game stem from quality of life changes that I think are necessary for this game to be considered top tier. Firstly, this game is not optimized for PC well enough. The actual gameplay when on a mission is good (for the most part) with no dips in FPS, but when you get to the Abbey it all goes out the window. Extreme frame rate drops on Abbey grounds. Usually get around 120-140 FPS in battle, but on the grounds it's 30-40 FPS consistently. The Abbey itself I feel like could have been built like XCOM2's main hub where you just click on a section and go to it to start research or talk to heroes or whatever else they included in the game. Being forced to walk around the Abbey in molasses, hearing the same exact phrases from Dr Strange, Blade, Ironman, Captain Marvel, etc gets extremely old after 20 missions or so, which brings me to my next issue, character dialogue. The interactions with heroes can be cool from a fanboy perspective, but the main character you play as, ""Hunter"", has the worst voice acting and overall presence in the game that it truly feels cringe. I understand he was pulled from the past, but wow. The VA for the male Hunter has the delivery of a high school film project. A lot of the heroes sound okay, but when it gets to the friendship building dialogue it becomes extremely cringe. This carries over to battles too when you hear a characters catch phrase for the umpteenth time. Last gripe I have would be the extremely slow battles. This is one game that needs a skip button or a fast forward button for battles. It gets tiresome wasting around 1-2 minutes watching the enemy take their turn, even your own turns take way too long. Missions would be over so much quicker if there was an option to speed up battle turns. I will say that the slog to get them all to max friendship can be a pain. For this game to be better I think it needs to be more optimized for PC. Abbey fixes, maybe make it completely optional to the point of having an XCOM2 like hub to avoid the walking around. The Abbey itself feels like a huge after thought and does not fit the actual gameplay of the game. Battle fixes: sometimes you will push an enemy and then they'll fly through the ground, making you restart the mission and not do the same thing that caused it to happen or just wait until you're lucky enough to have an attack all card. The game will crash randomly too. People have  been blaming the 2k Launcher for this but if you bypass it be prepared to not be able to use your previous saves.

Overall it's a fun game and I'd give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, but with all the bugs/crashes/lack of options to speed up fights I'm leaning towards a 6.

I am a big fan of strategy games and love the XCOM games.  There are a lot of elements of XCOM in the game, but on the base management side of things.  Combat is a mix between a card game, reminds me of Slay the Spire, and ""light"" strategy.  There are a lot of deeper strategy elements to the game, but they require upgraded the cards and developing relationships between the team members to pull off.  There is yet a whole other side to the game that feels a bit like a JRPG with lots of dialogue and time management to develop all members of the team.  I think you could forego most of RPG relationship elements and still play the game, but I think you would lose a lot of the powerful team up abilities and other bonus that make the game play smoothly.  I'll be honest I had low expectations going in and had a hard time figuring out what the game was for the first few hours.  I can appreciate all of the work that went into the story, but it felt a little out of place for me since I was used to more of the emergent story telling that happens with almost no dialogue in XCOM games.  In some ways the emergent story is hard to develop since each of the characters already have a defined character that seems fairly true to the comics.  I am also a big fan of comics, so eventually I was able to let go of some of my XCOM type expectations and enjoy the Marvel characters.  Once I was able to let go of my expectations and appreciate the game for what it is I began to get into it and really enjoy it so far.  I don't know if this game will have the replayability of XCOM games, but it has been a lot of fun.  I feel like this game is its own kind of genre and I kind of hope there are more games in this genre in the future.  All of that said I hope the studio makes more XCOM games soon :).  I can see a few elements of this game I would enjoy in future XCOM games.  I really miss the terrain and more tactical elements of XCOM that have been dropped for this outing.

Gameplay is split between two distinct activities: Card-based tactics battles and socializing with your team. 
These are pretty evenly split in time spent, so if you really don't like persona-esque socializing with video game characters, that's about half this game. I don't say that as a negative, in-fact I think that side of the game does quite a lot for it overall. The card battles are fun but I quickly became invested in these characters. Almost all of them are a pleasure to watch on screen and are written in unique ways. Seeing them play off each other and talking with them and building bonds is genuinely half the fun of the game. There's even a little superhero facebook that you can see them post to and comment on each other's stuff, it's a great opportunity to have these characters riff off each other and I always enjoyed reading them. Some people say the writing is cringy or something, I don't know what they mean. A good portion of the cast are young so they behave a lot like young people do, that might be annoying to some people but I found it very consistent with these versions of the characters. Magik is easily my favorite character, her powers are cool and all, but her personality and backstory really all come together to make one of my favorite characters in gaming.

So what's bad? It's kinda difficult to point to one singular thing.

The easiest criticism to make is the technical side of the game. I played on the highest settings, and the graphics range from unimpressive to actually bad, texture pop-in is noticeable. The opening of the game has what can only be described as the worst 480p looking pre-rendered cutscenes I've ever seen. Every cutscene is a bitrate dumpster fire until character creation, then there's one more and finally every custscene (minus one later) is in-engine and looks fine, not good because the graphics aren't great, but fine. The game also doesn't run as well as you'd hope for a game that looks like it does. To the game's credit it only crashed on me once, on the very last mission but it saves at the end of every turn so it was no big deal. Beyond that, there's a good amount of minor weirdness and lack of polish throughout the game. Random objects blocking the camera occasionally, people looking in the wrong direction during dialog, a missing act 3 title card that is just infinite black until you skip, and just general minor bugs that don't really do anything bad except look weird. The game feels like the dev team hammered out almost all critical bugs and didn't really care too much about the rest. 

The progression feels thoughtful but also lacking somehow. There's two outfits (The default and a 'Midnight Sun' getup) and alternate colors for both. The midnight sun outfits are unlocked for leveling up each friendship to level 5, or [spoiler] At the end of the game [/spoiler] whichever comes first. There's two additional outfits for each character that I'm sure 2K would love for you to spend money on, but it almost feels like they were supposed to be attainable via gameplay, because the abbey reasonably quickly runs out of stuff to give you in the cosmetic chests. It feels like the game would be amazing because there's some genuinely great game design in here but it feels like a second or third draft and not what the final product probably should be. While playing it gave me this feeling that I was playing the 70% finished version of a truly exceptional game. The characters are great, except the socializing feels slightly rushed and there's honestly no choices that matter, so every conversation just becomes the game where you pick what you think they want to hear, you never actually have to really commit and not be a social chameleon. 

I wish the game had real choices that really mattered, I wish there was more spontaneous interactions as opposed to the strict schedule the game operates on, I wish there was more time to see these characters shine, I wish the ending was better, I wish the game looked better, I wish the game ran better, I wish there was more to earn, and I wish there was more to do.

This game is good, but it's that rare kind of good that is almost painful because it is so close to being great. Firaxis found something here. I can only hope they'll get a chance to realize it's true potential. Hopefully a massive XCOM-esque expansion and a few updates can make this game what I know it could be.

As for now, I paid ~$40 for it, and I got 83 solid hours of enjoyable game. I'm happy with that purchase.",1674098788,1674098788,True,1,0,0.522293031215667725,0,True,False,False

Cons: 
- Not XCOM 3, not even a little bit (kind of unfair to call a con, but it's important that you know) 
- Abbey stuff gets tedious long before you're close to finishing the story
- Too much friendship stuff (for what it's worth from a guy who lives alone in a forest 100 miles from a Walmart) 
- Iron Man's voice actor sounds too much like Robert Downey Jr. and not enough like RDJ at the same time
- Way too many cutscenes
- If you're used to or looking for high-stakes missions like XCOM's you won't find them here
- Not much replayability (but you'll get enough out of a single playthrough)
- Hero leveling system is so shallow I don't even know why it's there. Heroes autolevel, missions scale to your heroes' levels, low-level heroes are eventually granted levels to catch up. Numbers just get bigger. It doesn't add anything, but it doesn't detract, either, because your cards/deck progression is sufficient. Squandered opportunity. 
- can't slap the name of your enemy on a rookie and feed them to a swarm of chryssalids

Pros: 
- Standard Marvel skybeam story is good enough
- Captain America doesn't constantly nag you about the Avatar Project
- Card based combat is fun and deck-building is interesting
- Loads of content; I'm at 33 hours and maybe halfway through. Your mileage will vary according to how fast you choose to advance through story missions
- Random supervillains pop up in missions like the Chosen in XCOM2: WotC
- Characters are as deep as you want them to be: you can hang out with all of them and join their clubs or just blow them all off and blow stuff up 
- Voice acting is top-notch. Lots of big names. Almost every interaction is voiced, which is incredible considering the sheer number of potential conversations.
- Blade
- XCOM easter eggs everywhere

The ability animations are readable, crunchy, and beautiful, and each hero, these we grew up with, truly feels unique.

--

Outside of combat, however, the game suffers.

Time such is broken up between interacting with heroes and exploring the wild. These activities add hours upon hours of content, but, looking back, I wish I would've skipped both altogether, and I advise you do just that.

Said interactions are often stale, annoying, and, as another reviewer said, Care-Bear-like, for they, the heroes--everyone of them--dissolve into uninteresting softies.

While exploring the wild offers (1) unlockable color palettes for costumes, via keyed chests--which is cool, but isn't worth the time required, and (2) bland side-stories, or ""mysteries,"" one of which revolves around the Salem Witch Trials--a story of [u]actual[/u] witches being hunted down during that time, which feels ... disingenuous, to say the least, to those who historically suffered because their neighbors fabricated stories about them because of village squabbles.

For those on Steam Deck, the game is a crash-fest, but is, actually, pretty easily remedied.

Watching and implementing the correction found in the YouTube video ""EASY & SAFE Health & Performance Boosts | Steam Deck"" fixes all crashing, which says a lot, as, before I used it, the game crashed some fifty times in my first thirty hours.

WARNING: If you are going to alter how you launch it for better performance, do it first because it did not let me use old save files afterward. 

Good: The game play is fun, yet simple. Requires a good amount of strategy to be efficient, but is forgiving enough to not be annoying. If you like turn based combat, or ability card based combat then you'll really enjoy this game. (KH: Chains of Memories/Persona/XCOM/etc) I really like the conversations you can have with the characters and the personalities they all have. I like the level of customization with your dorm room and the interactions with the NPCs outside of combat. Honestly, getting to know the characters and spending teh time to get gifts that they love, and do activities that they love with them are my favorite part of this game. IT really flourishes off the characters and getting to know them. IF you are just trying to get through the plot, you wont spend nearly as much time on the game and you may struggle. Mastering their friendship offers interesting dialogue options with them, but also stronger upgrades and cosmetics. Which is why I tell my friends, if you are not a Marvel fan, maybe lean away form this. They do a good job of giving backstory to each character as you get to know them if you are not currently aware of who they are. The characters are dynamic and engaging, even the ones you may not like at first. The voice acting is a huge save for this game. The world and story set up seems really interesting. As I approach nearly 70 hours of playing the game, I seem to only be half way through the main plot. Why? Cause I was absorbed in completing the sub plot of exploring the Abbey. I probably could have finished the main game by now, but I would not have the rewards I currently have for fully exploring it all. Allowing yourself to become part of the story and get invested in every part of it is what makes this game worth actually getting. The way of upgrading and getting new cards is easy to do, and character injuries are never a problem once you get one simple early upgrade to the Abbey. The upgrades to the various parts of the Abbey, exploration of the map, and the levels of customization outfits you get for each member of your team is actually the second best part of this game. The third is the combat, it is smooth and simple to learn. Its rewarding to get the missions done and to do them well. It only punishes you on the really important missions to the narrative, when these moments should matter. And I always enjoy games that I can grind through to become stronger and just blast through missions/quests easily. It makes the extra time you put into the game all the more worth it. 

Bad: On install, I could not get the 2K launcher to even appear. It wasn't until I gave steam and midnight suns admin privileges that the 2K launcher even appeared. I don't like that the 2K launcher can't be launched on its own to avoid the confusion with steam. Then I had the issue of trying to launch the game from 2K and it simply would not launch. I tried to do a work around that skipped the 2K launcher, which improved performacne but erased my original save files. Also with the 2K launcher enabled (not skipping) your save files DO NOT transfer via Steam Cloud Save. It does, however, if you skip it. It worked form desktop to my laptop. The intro cutscenes for the company logos are slow and hitch, game jsut freezes in combat, cutscenes desync or seem lower quality than the game play itself, menu just freezes too (it took me 5 min to press the save button). The frame rate seems locked in cutscenes, the loading times between game play and cutscenes are too long (and this is on an SSD). The audio either cuts out or desyncs about half the time. And half the character models just seem lower quality in cut scenes than they do in the game engine for combat. The game hitches between menu options and simple scenes, and textures like fire randomly fail. Some character models seem better than others, and some characters emote during dialogue way more than others. Also I have texture graphic corruption occur every other launch or when my game is running for longer than an hour or two. Some props or environmental pieces have trouble loading in properly also. This game definitely needs optimization work. 

Overall: Its a fun game, I personally waited till it was on sale and I'm glad I did not pay full price for it due to its lack of performance optimization. Combat runs great until the game just kind of freezes randomly between turns. If you are a marvel fan or a turn based combat fan, it's worth the try but definitely get it for a lower dollar amount. Until its performance is fixed, its not worth $60. Definitely worth playing at some point though. I like the characters and the story so far. For BEST PERFORMANCE: Please set your custom launch options to skip 2K. It allows cloud saves and the base game performance is far better. 2K fix your launcher, and Firaxis needs to fix their game a bit. Mostly 2K's issues. if steam would let me I'd give it a 6/10, cause of the annoying launch sequence and inconsistent performance. (I'm on an i9/3070/32gb RAM).

This is definitely a console game ported to the PC.   The User Interface (UI) is a little off-putting when on a computer or laptop.    After 30 hours I find the game is two things.  One, running around the abbey looking for widgets (ingredients and so forth) and revealing new areas to collect different widgets.   Two, puzzle solving combats.   They seem less about tactics and more like puzzle solving how to best win your trump in bridge with the cards you have.    You get 3 characters to bring along, each with 8 card hands and a randomised? draw to start the combat.   You have to suppress your opponents as fast as possible before they counter-attack;  AND achieve your objective.  (collect an item, stop an thing from being destroyed, ect).    After a while this gets monotonous.   Unlike XCOM, after 30 hours of play, I still have no sense of accomplishment.   Yes you level the heroes you have recruited.   But nothing else changes.   The combats/puzzles become a little more complex, but I do not see any accomplishment towards your goal.  Well their are 'Story' missions, there is no urgency to perform them.    In defeating the fallen, they seem to just run away.  No RAFT or any other containment area when defeated.  So they just so up again for more puzzle solving combats.   Making them more meaningless.

It tastes good, but every now and then you almost vomit from the inappropriate fish sauce.

Long version:
 
I haven't experienced an epic, long ""emotional"" RPG where you build relationships for years. It has that Mass Effect touch in this aspect.

The game is fun, and I played it everyday for 3 weeks. Completed the story, and unlocked most of the main stuff. This says a lot. Why the negative review? I almost gave this a positive review, but in the end there are just too much bad for a $100+ game.

Good

- Satisfying animations especially the powerful ones. Makes me want to unlock new cards just to see them.
- You can see relationships progress with each character. It feels like a journey of meeting strangers to getting to know each character.
- Large cast of characters with a lot of interaction (except maybe one).
- Interesting turned-based card tactics. Quite a few times I made some clever moves and won with 1 turn left. It feels epic and makes you go: ""I can't believe that just happened"".
- Mostly decent story and dialogue depending on your expectations. It's a bit unrealistic and almost Disney-like. It is what you'd expect from a family-friendly B grade superhero movie. I normally skip dialogues, but I listened to most of this one.
- Choosing a gift for a character is harder than the combat most of the time, until you work it out. Turns out Wolverine doesn't like... I already forgotten what the gift was. 
- Some good moments where you feel genuine connections with the characters.
- Sometimes funny.

Bad
- Memory leaks. Game crashes rarely. I had maybe 2-3 crashes in a 70 hour play-through.
- Massive FPS drops and stuttering after some conditions like using a specific ability. Still this was not bad for me on max graphic settings. But the last mission was so bad that it was stuttering all mission... and it was a long mission.
- Abbey exploration is tedious and boring. If your gameplay is boring in a game, you ****ked up. Most of the abbey rewards are just keys to open some chest for cosmetic currency. And yes, it is tedious even with in-game puzzle hints.
- Abbey exploration has no jump, and invisible walls before a ledge. Really?? x2 the tediousness.
- A looooot of talking... like you spend half the game talking. 
- Gameplay loop is 10% abbey exploration (more for completionists), 40% talking, 40% turned-based combat.
- Difficulty choices are fake. Increased health and damage means you spend more time grinding, and favouring healing meta. Heroic 2-3 is the max if you want to just enjoy any hero combo, without min-maxing.
- Paid cosmetics in $100 game? **** off, gamers don't want it, don't put it in AAA games.
- No fast animation option. Normally, this immediately triggers me in turned-based games. Somehow, I did not get too annoyed until near the end. It is probably because there are so many ways you can play the next turn it keeps me thinking. Still I don't feel like wasting my time with new game+ unless there is this option.
- Some annoying characters like Nico. Was the cringey fake Japanese necessary?
- Unrealistic writing and dialogue at times. An immortal with centuries worth of experience acts like a newbie parent, who struggles to handle basic social problems? A tantrum-throwing, whiny, reckless character allowed to wield magic willy-nilly that could end the multiverse? I find it hard to believe a team of highly experienced superheroes would accidentally let this happen or behave this way.
- Difficulty curve in a mission is unbalanced. It starts off hard usually, then becomes a drag to end it due to the high HP of enemies. It becomes worse with higher difficulty options.

Finally, I suggest adding a rogue-like mode. 1 life, random rewards = each run is unique with improvised builds. The game is perfect for it.

In the end, this could have been a great game. Like Doom Eternal, it plays nice, looks nice, has a lot of good going for it; but someone decided to throw in a bunch of stuff that doesn't belong. Topped up with technical issues, and overall subpar work throughout, it just ended up as a missed opportunity - albeit an addictive and fun missed opportunity.

I've always likes the Marvel IPs even if I have never read the comic and only caught a few of the shows and movies growing up.  The depth of some of the stories always seemed like they would take way too much time to explore.   Games like this one do a good job of giving me some depth into these characters without having to go read a mountain of comics.  I think even if you don't know anything about any of the Marvel heroes or stories you will not miss much in this game.  I think a conversation that Captain Marvel has with you that mentions ""Steve"" off handedly before you meet Captain America is about the worst it gets for anyone not familar with the IP.

The game play is simple enough with a mission consisting of 3 heroes with 8 cards each and most of your actions come from a hand of these cards.  As the game progresses you can customise these heroes in various ways and get some intereting combos.   The core combat mechanics are solid and work well and except for villians falling through the floor from time to time I have not had any major complaints.  (If you do find an enemy sinking into the floor know that it's still there and you can target it even if you can't see it, Hope they fix this soon)

Between combat sessions you will wander around your base and developp friendships with the other characters.  The voice acting is good and the only issue I have had in this area is the modles sometimes clip when they turn their heads strangely or look at you when talking to someone else.  I liked the writting and voice acting.  The puzzles and gathering are an okay distraction but can take quite a bit of time and the rewards are mainly cosmetics with the occasional consumable item.  I like the general social aspects of this aspect of the game but the run around parts with the little collection side quests seemed like it could have been removed.   I completed the major part of the run around area and the story was interesting but the game play was so disconected from the main combat gameplay that I really wasn't that interested and at one point the progress just stops so abruptly with almost no warning  that it became more of an agravation that was only solved by progressing the story a significanty amount.   It's so bad that many refer to it as a bug, just adding to the fact that this part of the game could have used a bit more polish.  

Overall I like the game and even for the very steep price I'd recommend it for people who like Marvel and turn based card battlers and have the extra money to burn.  If they can fix the major enemy sinking into the floor issues it will be even better.   I'd have been even happier if they cut our the areas around the base and instead used that time and effort to add more heroes and mission branching but it's not so bad to bring my likeing of the rest of the game down very much.",1673974620,1673974620,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

edit: Faces the same problem as all games with enemy scaling. As you level up you actually feel less powerful as enemies increase damage and health, while the only damage that increases, beyond 25, is Offense and that  doesn't change card damage enough to keep up.

Might Suns is a mish-mash of XCOM and Slay the Spire with some fun 3rd person exploration and relationship management (a la Fire Emblem: Three Houses / Persona) thrown in. Moreover, it has a great story with interesting characters who change over time, which is hardly a given in today's market. As with XCOM there are hours upon hours of play time and lots of different team configurations and power configurations you can pursue for a varied experience along with varied difficulty levels which scale mission rewards.

The randomness of mission rewards (given in a loot box format - but not one that you can ever pay for, except through good ol' playing the game) adds another dimension to replayability. The rewards - ability cards, mostly - channel that same dopamine you get from loot boxes, but, y'know, without the predatory microtransactions. Meanwhile, the ability to upgrade and manufacture cards makes redundant abilities valuable and massively reduces regret during reward choices.

I've played 28 hours and 50% of my team is level 11 (the others are between 8 and 10)...

The gameplay is ok, it is genuinely inspired as a concept but sadly too shallow. If there was more the rest of this review wouldn't matter. Instead of focusing on fleshing out the gameplay with more enemies, cards, characters, mission types and dynamic battle maps, they built 2 other sections to this game that I can't help but consider bad bloat. One is a very shallow walking simulator on a spooky island that is inspired by the salem witch trials. It has nothing to do with any of the heroes (unless you are extremely familiar with marvel it is extremely out of place, and even then....) and the other is a shoddily put together visual novel/dating simulator where you ""talk"" one on one with heroes where dialogue choices don't have meaningful effect, so pretty much a hangout movie. These two things together seem to have siphoned the majority of development budget sadly. Graphics are very mediocre, many bugs though nothing game breaking, animations are limited, dialogue constantly gets cut off, and personally, maybe I haven't read a comic book in too long, but the writing is very bad. Just from a narrative perspective so much of this story is phoned in. All the other short comings could be forgiven if this was better but my god....this is bad. The main character is a mary sue which should be fine in a video game but you're telling me they sidelined Wanda from her own story just to have my character come in and take over her role? Why do I even need a main character? The story would have been better served had the hunter never existed frankly. I will admit I like the characters, there are little things here and there that I have hang ups on but that's probably more a symptom of being a bad dating simulator than anything else.

Pros: 
* Probably the best tactical combat I've played in a long time. I love tactical games but they can become repetitive over time; the same characters using the same abilities over and over again every fight. In this game there are so many different characters and the game forces you to change up your team on a regular basis. The cards and deck building keeps it fun and fresh. Even with the same team, I could play out differently based on the scenario and the cards you draw.

* The graphics are beautiful. I really enjoyed exploring the abbey. You slowly unlock abilities that allow you to explore deeper into the abbey grounds. For me, it added an additional element to the game. It breaks up the combat. I gather from some of the reviews that some people would have preferred that the combat be the main focus of the game, but I liked that the game had more depth. 

* There is a lot of different activities in this game. It is not just go to next location and fight the next group like a lot of tactical games. You can hang out with your favorite super hero, train, send your teammates on missions, explore the grounds, solve puzzles, craft new items and cards.

* I love the idea of merging a tactical game with a card game. They really were able to merge the best of both worlds. It works really well.

Cons:
* I liked conversing with the different characters, but it was too much of a good thing. I liked the hangouts and the clubs, but there was just too much talking to the characters often without advancing the story. I didn't mind it when the characters explained their backstory because not everyone is familiar with the marvel universe, but again there was too much idle chatter with little purpose. The devs just missed the sweet spot. Conversations that introduce the characters and advance the story should have been sufficient. The rest began to get tedious.

* Some of the heroes you acquire way late in the game. If you had hoped to play the game with Wolverine, Scarlet Witch, or the Hulk, you are going to be very disappointed. They don't join your team until much later in the game.

* Monetization. Not surprising nowadays but I don't have to like it.",1673914923,1673914923,True,3,0,0.553470909595489502,0,True,False,False

While some reviews have complained that the combat is quite repetitive, which is is the same format over and over, you are encouraged to mix out your team and abilities so, so far (around two weeks in of a good few hours every other night playing) it is still awesome.  There is a heavy mix amount of story and exploration, but as a marvel fan I am really enjoying this as it is well done and featuring characters like Niko and Magik which don't normally get this much attention which is really great to explore.  

I also really like the cg models they have used for the characters which are much more realistic than most adaptations of comic characters.

I think the core game is excellent, and there are story beats which capture some cool moments. Others here have described it as Persona in Marvel set dressing, which will hopefully steer your interest one way or another. 

The core game (missions) is excellent, and I think Firaxis outdid themselves with the general engine of combining different hero decks together. Every hero feels distinct and flavorful, and combining them together yields some great gameplay decisions. And while you can certainly ‘pick your favourite team’ and stick with them; missions force you to take particular people which makes you experiment with different approaches. There are certainly some hero combinations which I prefer to steer clear of, but I’ve had more pleasant experiences of discovering how some combinations work as opposed to the frustration of ‘Eugh; I can’t believe I have to take X again…’. 

Make no mistake, I think if you’re going to love this game, it’ll be because of that aforementioned card game. On a side note, I want to do a little shout out to ‘Smash Up’, the real life board game which mirrors this idea of merging different decks together, so if you enjoy MMS; maybe give that a look too. 

I do think that the people who wrote the story of this game hold a genuine love for the Marvel universe. Unlike a movie, MMS has enough run time to let you follow characters through their dips and highs, and while it’s all a little cheesy: I genuinely enjoyed empathising with characters who were worried about their family, or celebrating when I found a present that I knew someone would love because I’d paid attention to their back story. Your characters are characters with their own motivations and interests, and I appreciate that the story clashes them against each other as they develop into a team. 

Although I’d be remiss not to mention how weird it feels to create a world with specific power bands, and then have to cram all of that into a video game which requires things to level out. What I mean by this is setting a world with someone like Captain Marvel or the Hulk, and then trying to explain why they’re having trouble punching a truck or a helicopter. I imagine the folks at the Injustice franchise probably suffered the exact same problem as a result of their IP. If anything, it’s a credit to Firaxis that they managed to still make the heroes feel distinct with some sort of adherence to their lore, while still making a game that plays right.

But with that said, and despite my own desire to see this story through: I still wouldn’t recommend someone else pick it up for a variety of reasons. 

1.) In my opinion, the entire ‘exploration’ side of the game feels a little tacked on. It’s little things like how you move like you’re gliding across the world, or how you’ll get hung up on terrain that looks like you should be able to navigate it. I say this knowing that 90% of the story and all of the supporting economy of reagents and discoverables comes from the exploration component, but I think it either needed to be taken out or worked on a lot more to make it feel like it was part of the experience. 

To paraphrase an interview between Jake Solomon and Sid Meier: I think MMS would’ve been better as ‘one good game, instead of two great ones’. 

2.) Speaking of economy, I flat out hate the way Gloss works in MMS. Throughout the game you’ll discover new colour palettes, and cosmetic items for your various characters, but in order to actually use them; you need to pay via an in-game currency. I get the sense that this is meant to act as a braking system so you’re not just flooded with new cosmetic options all the time (and instead have to select which ones you want as you discover them), but it makes me feel like the game doesn’t respect my time. Just let me have the thing I found, or build a better system for how I discover new cosmetic items; but I think that system feels kinda stilted. 

3.) A lot of the exploration game feels like a slot machine. Maybe I’m just getting to be a crotchety old man, but this game HAMMERS you with the same sort of jingling bells and flashing lights that I would expect out of someone trying to build a crappy skinner box. Every crate opened, every gamma coil cracked, every use of your power words all has to come with the ringing and flashing of a game that doesn’t trust itself to hold your attention. I legitimately had to start closing my eyes whenever I ‘opened’ a thing because the flashes were starting to get to me. 

I can’t help but feel that all of these issues point to an underlying problem, which is that MMS feels like a game that was made for a mobile platform; and they decided to half-heartedly upgrade it to play as a full game. I could be completely wrong here, but so much of the experience feels like they started with the core game (card play during missions), and then tacked on an exploration mode with slot machine mechanics to make you come back for more. Hell, even the Gloss system feels like it should’ve been something you paid for with a credit card based on the layering system of not getting to unlock cosmetics after finding them. 

If I’m right, I have to admit I’d much prefer this over another mobile game but I think the part that bugs me is that this could’ve been another great game from Firaxis where we just bought the entire experience and played it as a complete package, rather than what feels like two pieces that were bolted together. 

So yeah… I think MMS has all the chops of being a fantastic game, but it very much feels like they couldn’t really decide on whether it was going to be a mobile-cash-and-grab, or a full fledged standalone game, and they made the worst decision of trying to go down the middle (after all, if they just made a mobile slot machine game, I could just ignore it). Maybe consider grabbing it if the price comes down which might even give Firaxis some time to fix some of the tiny technical glitches which are still present at time of writing (Jan 16 2023).

Enjoyable game overall, mechanics are fun, exploration interludes break up the card-playing times and once you get the Limbo portal dailies to level up under-utilized heroes by playing essentially a god-mode you get a much better sense of how each heroes cards work.

[b]Firaxis[/b] has managed to meld together several disparate elements in their creation of a unique twist on the turn-based, X-Com-style strategy game.

It seems to be popular for reviewers and gamers to compare or contrast Midnight Suns with Firaxis' previous X-Com titles but it's really not the best comparison. If you grew up playing Sid Meier games, then you'd know that Marvel Midnight Suns is really best compared to not just the X-Com series, as it definitely contains some of that DNA, but more appropriately to [b]Sid Meier's Pirates![/b]  Pirates! had action elements but also mixed in bits and pieces of sim-style gameplay in the process. Midnight Suns tasks players with not just managing the excellent combat but also handling elements of the social interaction between superheroes. This is the area that some players grumble about, revealing a lack of experience with previous Sid Meier titles. I suspect that some of the angst over these social elements is tied into the average nerd's difficulties with these types of social situations mixed with the hyperactive needs of the more modern gamer.  

Firaxis was fairly clear from the start that developing and enjoying the interactions among these awesome Marvel characters was going to be just as much of a part of the game as any combat situations so it's a bit odd that some review sites or gamers were confused or caught off-guard by these gameplay elements.

The real question players need answered is how well does a game balance the slower RPG-style social interactions with the more visceral and dramatic combat scenes?  

Marvel Midnight Suns happily manages to balance both of these aspects extremely well.  Are there some slower moments at times?  Sure, but the player has the ultimate power to decide how much time and effort to put into the social aspects versus combat.  You could cruise fairly fast through the social aspect and just focus on the exceptionally enjoyable card-based combat but I feel like you'd be really missing out on a lot of great Superhero subtext and fun character moments.

Furthermore, for a game with a large amount of RPG-style social interactions, it's critical that the voice-acting and writing is very good and thankfully, it is.  Midnight Suns manages to be both funny, moving, and interesting all at once.  I can't count how many times I laughed out loud at a great bit of dialogue or interaction between characters.  The voice-acting was exceptionally good and the voice-actors used almost all perfect for their roles (my only niggling complaint is that the actor for Dr. Strange came off a bit wimpy at times.)

Combat is extremely good. It leverages a card-based system that each turn provides players with the ability to play 3 cards, perform 2 redraws, and move a character once (which allows them to interact with the environment in interesting ways).  Some players have complained about this because there's a mentality that seems to think that using a card-based system means that the game is shallow or focuses too much on card-based aspects but really it's just a visual thing - the cards could just as easily be small icons that you click on.  In this regard, I feel that using cards and a modifiable deck to contain each heroes powers is both clever and functional. In other words the card-based system works extremely well to represent superhero abilities in battle.  And the in-combat abilities look amazing and are very well-represented and specific to each hero.  Spider-man utilizes several web-based or reflex-based abilities while Dr. Strange might weave a mystical weapon out of thin air.  If you ever wanted to feel like a Marvel Superhero slinging your abilities this way and that to defeat bad guys, this game captures that experience like no other (except for perhaps Marvel's Spider-man by Insomniac Games.)

My only minor complaint is that the combat happens in fairly basic and smaller-sized battle arenas rather than a larger sprawling map that could really have showcased some Superhero movement abilities in interesting ways.  My suspicion is that balancing out all the movement and combat abilities proved tricky and that the arena-style maps were the easiest concession towards balance. But despite the smaller-sized arenas, missions are interestingly varied with several clever and enjoyable mini-goals to achieve while battling things out.  In one mission I need to focus on wiping out specific enemies that hold keycards to unlock containers, while in another I may have to defeat a very powerful defensive player in order to acquire a mystical item. 

Players can not only unlock a ton of cosmetics (clothes, superhero outfits, and room items) but also can upgrade their cards (abilities) and create various one-time boost items that aid in combat.

Overall, this game was super stable for me, looked fantastic, had amazing voice-work and writing, and a fun albeit linear story.  This game should absolutely have an Overwhelmingly Positive score on the Steam store and the fact that it doesn't only continues to reflect on how incapable the average gamer is at making intelligent and accurate qualitative assessments.  Ignore the bad reviews on STEAM here as I've read most of them and haven't seen really any accurate complaints and in some cases, they're actually straight-up inaccurate.  This is a wonderful Marvel game that covers the more mystical Characters of the Marvel universe while providing extended cameos of some of Marvel's most favorite heroes, as well.

The combat is very different from XCOM in that there is no concept of cover, any of your characters can attack an enemy anywhere on the map and vice versa. However, there is way more interaction with the environment and sending enemies flying into walls, generators, explosive barrels and even just off the map doesnt get old.

Like XCOM(ish) there is also a hub area outside of combat where you can upgrade your characters, base components to give advantages when going back into combat. On top of this there is a relationship type system where you can become friends with the various super-heroes and unlock combo abilities

 If you are a fan of turn based strategy/deck builders, definitely worth a go. I understand that there are MTX for cosmetics but I've completely ignored that.

The game itself is engaging and certainly appealed to me as a Marvel and X-Com fan.  Yes the missions get a little repetitive, but I found this with X-Com as well.  The advantage here is that the experience changes every time because you have different heroes, and that is where the real mission diversity comes from.  Some heroes mesh well together and other combinations can be a real challenge.  Also, I played the first time on Normal and at first it was quite challenging, but later in the game, as I leveled up powers and friendships, it got a bit too easy.

Some people may complain that the dialogue is cheesy - and they're not wrong - however if you've ever read a comic book in the last 30 years, this exactly how the writing is. And it is BEAUTIFUL.

And even if the dialogue still a bit much for you, you can pretty much get through the entire game without having to play into the friendship system at all. But it IS rewarding, so missing out on all of the dialogue would be a mistake in my opinion.

The combat and mechanics of the game are solid if not tedious and repetitive but card customization leaves you with some options. Grinding out to get a perfect kit for a character is rewarding.  It absolutely has some severe performance issues, even on bleeding edge computers. screen stuttering, slow downs, textures tearing or kaleidoscoping. But I can get past ALL of that. 

What I find to be the most damning is the story and contempt for the lore of several characters.  Spoilers from here on.[spoiler]First they call Johnny Blaze the Original Ghost Rider which canonically is right in the sense that he was the first one a comic was made about, but timeline wise he is FAR from it. He also ends up dying like a chump, in a way that no Ghost Rider actually can. In fact it is so hard to kill Ghost Rider that basically only God can do it. Seriously look up how broken Ghost Rider is.  He can single handedly kill Thanos...and has done it. Hell, he EVEN RODE A DEAD CELESTIAL.  Now one can say that Johnny Blaze doesn't have the power of the Spirit of Vengeance in this game, but hes got the hell cycle and the flaming shotgun so...he does. You either have the spirit, or you don't. [/spoiler]

The other major problem that I have with the game's story is that it doesn't seem to matter what you do in story missions. You have a goal when the mission starts. You complete said goal in the mission. You complete the mission per the mission parameters that were set. 1 of 2 things ALWAYS happens. 1. Boss gets right back up, nothing you did matters in the slightest, and wins in the cutscene. 2. You seemingly win and leave knowing that you mission was a success...only to immediately see another cutscene of the villain surviving getting up and completing their objective anyway. I mean the heroes are completely incompetent with the only win coming at the end of the game, I would think, i havent beaten it yet. And this happens at EVERY MAJOR INTERVAL of the game, not even chapter bosses. One story part has clear objectives on how to do a mission, but once you get in the mission, the mission objective ITSELF tells you to do things out of order, and then in the cutscene, the thing you were supposed to do 3 times, you do once, and then run away. cutscene ends and leaves you screaming at the monitor in frustration. ALL that build up an Cutscene Heroes mess everything up. But then not even 3 seconds later, while you are fuming, it turns out you succeeded after all. Who the HELL knows how. Cause I don't. 

This game's major failing like many games is that the cutscenes of the game give you more effect on what you just spent hours doing and you don't feel rewarded. This is whether or not the cutscenes undermines what you just did, like this game, or The Force Awakens (on WII) having you pull a star destroyer out of the sky during the cutscene. In Deus Ex Human Revolution Cutscene Jensen makes all the important decisions and does all the cool things in the game. We should not be rewarding development teams by praising their games when you are basically along for the ride. Yeah you get to do some things but why am I not doing it all. 

The games writing for dialogs before missions and for hang outs is great. The news reports and forum posts are great. I loved the little nods to other characters even if they weren't by name.  The games exploration is fun if not tedious wondering what flowers and herbs have respawned on what day. But at the end of the day. I can only feel contempt for the game. It doesn't leave me feeling like a superhero at all. It leaves me feeling like Bruce Banner or Johnny Blaze, or Robbie Reyes. I get to take a back seat to the plot during cutscenes while the Hulk or Ghost Rider makes all the decisions and I am just along for the ride.",1673843352,1673843352,False,1,0,0.451467275619506836,0,True,False,False

The world is interesting and there is a lot more to do than you would think. 

The game is setup in a way where you can do as much or as little of the game that is interesting to you, and you can switch between different all the different mechanics as much or as little as you want.

There are a few grips I have with the game;

-Some mechanics do seem underbaked. I can see what the Devs were trying to do, but think everything in the game can be fleshed out more if time or money didn't exist as a constraint. I am very interested to see what future titles in this style grow to be.

-Late game encounters can become very tedious as you wait for the enemies to finish their turn. [spoiler] When you fight Nest Mothers, Revenants, and Doppelganers you can be waiting for what feels like forever. I do like the mechanics of these enemies, they are fun and challenging to fight. However I just feel like there could be a faster way to show enemy actions. (Maybe simultaneously or after the first animation the rest are sped up? idk I'm no designer lol) [/spoiler]

-I ran into a few crashes and bugs throughout the game (enemies not dying even at 1 hp, missing textures, tPoses.) and it seemed to run worse as I got closer to the endgame. Even at 120fps I experienced really bad studdering [spoiler] when the sky turned green [/spoiler]. And the framerate on the last mission was average 20-30fps [spoiler] during the second half when you form the seal [/spoiler]. The game started running so poorly that even though I was having a lot of fun unlocking items, building friendships (and decks), and reading lore, I rushed through to see the ending because It became a chore.

With all that said I would still recommend Midnight Suns to anyone who likes Deckbuilders, Xcom-like strategy, Bioware titles like Mass Effect and Dragon Age. I am not super into Marvel but liked the story and characters so much that I was looking for other media for more with the lesser known heroes (even rewatched the Blade Trilogy with my wife lol). I went in expecting a ""3D Slay the Spire"" but ended up getting a great RPG with deckbuilding mechanics.

The real shining gem for this game is the combat - if you're a turn based fan, this game will be right up your alley.

Overall I like it alot, mainly from a fun perspective, the combat is friggin fantastic. This was the element I was most curious about for this game, with it being a marvel game and a card/deck type game to, by a dev team that knows how to do turnbased combat perfect from Xcom. I love the combat, its so much fun.

The graphics are also nice for the most part, the animations are fantastic and its just good old school fun when in combat. 

That last line ""When in combat"" is part of this games biggest issue. The writing of the dialogue. The overall story or whatever seems decent enough but the abbey dialogue and most of the dialogue in general is pretty terrible. Then again I am not a fan of Marvel movies at all so that could be it. The only Super hero games I have liked the stories of in the past is the Arkham games.

Overall though after having played 20 hours so far (mostly all on the steamdeck), I must say that the general combat some of the best around and even some of the upgrade and improving things at The Abbey is good, thankfully to give some good aspects next to the cringe dialogue. I like the idea of creating a super hero and even some of the ideas of the Abbey but most of the dialogue could be improved imo.

If you like turnbased combat pick this up, the writing sucks but you can also just skip that and get to the upgrading and combat stuff which is all top notch. I was 50-50 on if I would like this game or not before starting it up but the combat won me over, along with the fantastic animations, upgrading,etc.. are all very well done, some shotty writting at times doesn't take away from the joy i have while in the combat part of the game. 

At the end of the day, Xcom doesn't have great writing either so this works for me even with its meh writing. That combat is so dang fun, some elements from xcom, some of its own elements, along with a card system mixed in, its a wonderful bit of turnbased action. Performance wise the game could be better but its a turnbased combat game so it doesn't bother me much. After you have been to the Abbey a handful of times it seems to run better than it did the first few times. The game does most things great, solid 8/10 for me, if it had Arkham level of writing it would be a 9 or higher for me.

Combat = 10/10
Animations = 10/10
Graphics 7/10
Writing 3/10
Audio = 8/10
Performance = 6/10
Controls = 10/10
Fun Factor = 9/10

As far as big bugs havn't really had any other than one small bug where in one combat instance where the camera went under the ground for a few seconds.

**Steam Deck users, you should do the Vram fix and CyroUtilities fix and the game will run perfect. If you don't do those two quick easy things then the game will crash when you go to sleep often.

In short the combat is alright and they have tied in the battlefield environment in ways that XCOM doesn't. It's really cool to survey the battlefield and always be thinking about how to control the mobs and proceed with the fight. The mix of heroes and how you pair them adds a lot of flexibility to the playstyle you're going for. But the card abilities are pretty basic so if you're looking for a solid card game like hearthstone or magic mixed with XCOM - lol yeah this isn't it. 

However Jesus Fucking Christ, the amount of talking this game has you doing is boring as shit. Each mission is shielded behind cutscenes after cutscenes of forced conversations with beta heroes you don't really care about. And ""friendship"" missions that make hard characters like Blade & Wolverine look like beta cucks simping for your approval and advice. 

The game wants you to spend hours running around your base looking for hangout spots to take your new superheroes friends, so you can talk about who Blade has a crush on or accept missions where you have to go talk to all the other heroes in order to plan a surprise party....

-------
You have to use the 2k launcher to play this, no thank you, It's one of those Nvida games that somehow manages to run like a 2008 Prius on anything not using that card. I had to fiddle with the settings to get it to not look like everything was made out of play dough, only to find the dialogue more grating than endearing. Talk and Walk comedy is about pacing and it seems the actors were probably recording lines separately.

The game keeps freezing and crashing.

The game is super simple and fun.

As if the characters aren't really giving it their all. And I don't mean the damage they're doing, but it feels like they tried to stuff action RPG style graphics into a card game. In fact I would say that's exactly what they did, and failed at far as I can tell so far. The cinematic sequences are ok, not impressive when compared with past Marvel games, not at all. Just.. ok. Some of the dialogue is amusing, hokey, campy, and some of it is just poorly written. For a game that's trying so hard to be ""cinematic"" in it's story delivery, this game fails hard. Acceptable, if it were free, or at a cost of say $5-$10. But with a non-sale price tag of $59.99 for the base game, $99.99 for the legendary edition with all of it's assorted bells and whistles, not at all ok. If you're wanting a Marvel game with graphics on par or better than these, and a wide assortment/cast of characters with varying costumes and you have no issue dropping $100 here or there for game extras, then the mobile game, Marvel Future Fight is a better bucket to drop your money in. The action is better, the story is better, the graphics are at least on par and the price point is actually similar. And what exactly is the excuse for the lame duck story here? There are literally decades of great content in the marvel story backlog, multiplied by several magnitudes. Fans would be ecstatic to see some of that given proper treatment in a video game. Did you lose a bet and have to use this story instead?

Kudos to 2k for indicating on the store page that the game includes DRM. It's better than some of the companies out there right now (looking at you Ubisoft). That said, it's still pointless BS that only serves to hamper gamers from being able to enjoy the product we paid for. So... kudos for not hiding the DRM, but shame on you for using it in the first place. It does nothing to truly protect your game from piracy, which is a false flag concern in the first place. Even if there were hordes of people on the internet looking to ""steal"" your game who are also somehow unable to surpass your nifty trash DRM (and of course, nothing like that exists out there, right?) But even if there were, stop clowning your paying customers with this nonsense, you're not losing money with it, but you certainly are without it. For every gamer who's willing to put up with your DRM there's another four who will walk away and play something that doesn't utilize DRM. And behind them is that teeming horde who are willing to pirate your content anyway, waiting with open arms to welcome any players who get fed up enough with your nonsense to go over to the ""dark side"". So shame on you 2k and Firaxis for hiding behind fabricated reasons for DRM, and possibly shame on me for being willing to give you money in the first place. I'll comtemplate that later, likely while I'm playing a game designed by some other studio, with better graphics, story and game play.

A fun mix of characters to be sure and some I know are present I cannot wait to get far enough to unlock and give a try.  Maybe some of the characters could have been designed differently, mainly in the face; but it isn't enough to put me off from enjoying the time with them.

Talking to and becoming better friends with the characters.  A light and dark options path...still have to see how it affects things in the end besides answers.  Maybe separate endings?  I don't know and not looking it up at the moment to avoid spoilers.  I likely will play through with the opposite answer set anyways.

Ops, intel bonuses, and more have been opening up giving further choices on what to do while going forward.  I am appreciating the extra things.

Resources seem to be a bit tight, not sure if that will remain or not as the story pushes further.

The combat is definitely the highlight.  Lots of fun with the mixing of characters, deck build choices, the enemies, the environment, etc.  Everything looks great and fun as abilities and characters go moving about the battlefield.

They say it is up to you or not if you want to explore the Abbey grounds, but I feel like you will miss out on things if you don't so not sure how much of a choice that really is.

So far performance overall has been good, which I was afraid of with the basic reviews I listened to before purchasing.  I did just have a graphical glitch happen on me though that I had to quit (and thus thought why not put up an initial thoughts review) to clear up what was going on.

----------------------------------------------------------

Edit (19.3 hours, original about 6 hours in):

Got a few more heroes...hurray!  Really love Magick and Nico.  Spider-man feels like his quick self.  Wolverine just slashing things up.  I think the ability cards I have seen for the heroes I do have really make them feel like they should. 

Still enjoying everything.  A new word of power is letting me dig around more throughout the Abbey.  I don't explore it all the time (mostly when I want a bit of a combat or dialogue break) and the fast travel points are helpful if I am just trying to get to some arcane chests to see if they reset.

Resources do seem to be somewhat better.  Mostly from gaining some better understanding of things overall as I have been going.

Been seeing more of the graphic problem I noted previously.   It seems to only be happening when I am exploring the Abbey.  Occasionally the textures do not load at all.  Other times it is odd sparkly colors that seem to start up and get worse if I try to push on unless I restart things.   This is even after updating to the recently released NVIDIA driver update, hoping it would fix things.

Also, just a minor note, that I have had the game crash once on me.  Unsure what was the cause, but it was a while ago and hasn't happened again...yet.

While I can understand why some find problems with the game overall for me I say ""Make mine Marvel...Midnight Suns!  Excelsior!""",1673130865,1673737588,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I'm just not used to paying that much for games, especially when there are great ones at 5$ too. I'm at 76 hours, not finished the game yet without going out of my way to make it longer than necessary.

Combat is good and diverse, the challenge scales based on your wants as you progress (I'm just using the hardest difficulty level in recent missions). There are for sure a variety of ways you can handle it. I went from no-exhaust mindbreaker to trying out free cards which give heroism points. My patience card randomly got ""quick"" as a mod and I decided to keep it. Very ""don't blink you'll miss it.""

I find Tony gets worse and worse the more you get to know him, and that sounds about right. Honestly I'd have probably sided with Lilith. I'm hoping Hunter has options to hear the underlying messages. The characters do feel very personable regardless.

There are some beefs with the game, like all the abbey stuff seems like adding things to do which you will probably always do the same. Kind of like how pathfinder kingmaker creates the illusion of replayability (it isn't base building like that, just the feeling). It does inject a lot of lore though, I took it that way. But you hit the content cap there way before the missions are done. 

The hero ops thing is largely a waste of time, but a convoluted way of getting rare and epic cards. This just needed to be more interesting, there's nothing wrong with it being there.

The cosmetic options are great but again you run out of them way before the end of the game and though there are some very cool rare seeming options, there aren't enough! Why no elf ears? :\ this is a mutants setting, more mutant centric character base options, even if they're 'mutations' and not natural is still better. As unlocks is okay. I mean the green skin is an unlock! I guess because you play a static character ""The Hunter"" so their origin story is what it is naturally.

You will always build the same upgrades, and that kind of takes away from the base building 'tag'. I like what there is, I just wanted it to feel like replayability was kept in mind. Xcom handled this a bit better. Also some of the upgrades fell very flat compared to others.

A big surprise I didn't realize until just last night, the comic covers you get at the end of the mission you can convert into prints for your picture frames for some gloss. Very cool. I have a massive stockpile of presents. Is there no xmas possible where I'm like ""Please help, I am a hoarder."" The haven thing is a bit epic. I made Wolverine go bird watching with me. :D *A tiny savage* The bowl rewards are lame. Especially since you give 4 options for how to use the bowl. This was just lazy.

I am thoroughly enjoying this game, as a Marvel fanatic and also a tactical player. I travel a lot for work and since it was also made for console, I figured great controller support, AKA great Steam Deck support. I was pretty wrong! This will absolutely crash your Steam Deck without anything intense going on. Additionally, despite it saying ""Cloud Saves Sync'd"" nothing will ever be able to use those saves. 

I have been playing on my PC with a controller and love it. The graphics go from ""Good"" to ""PS2 levels of bad"". Cut-scenes frequently have a distancing fade issue (E.g. almost every cutscene with Nico her face is blurred out like she's in witsec, and you'll only see her necklace. I've seen this on many VODs too).

Combat is fun, banter is fun, relationships are fun. If you only plan to play on a single PC, I recommend.

I'm a middle aged gamer, that enjoys RPG, tactical, strategy, both real-time & turn based combat.  I have played the XCOMs repeatedly and while MMS isn't that, it does have the same 'one more mission' effect that kept me going back.  

The tactical play is immensely fun with enough variety to always keep things fresh.  I was able to find a difficulty in the middle that wasn't so punishing that I had to save scum, but also not so easy that I was just going through motions.  It requires thought & planning, with so many ways to solve a particular mission.  I would encourage anyone though not to try and min/max but to simply take the characters they enjoy interacting with or whose combat, costumes, and all rise above the rest.  I tried to rotate all characters & combinations so that I didn't miss out - I think that worked because by the end even sparky became someone I was glad to have with.

Right at the outset I was engaged.  I enjoyed discovering all the mechanics, and there are quite a few; layers  which become uncovered during Act1 and still into Act 2.  I enjoyed exploration of the local area, hunting for various goodies.  

I enjoyed the vast VAST amount of dialogue.  Yes sometimes there is a lot and I was itching to go on a mission, but then I also settled in to let the game move things along at its natural pace.  As such there is a wealth of character backstory plus affinity for them to be found.  Several of the actors truly emodied the character they represent, in my mind - While others were off the mark, but I don't think that broke immersion.  

Overall I spent 73 hours in this & that was not probably about 95% complete except a few late friendships maxing out.  Yes there are some flaws.  The game loop borders on repetitive some days, where I'd have to change up how I ran the map just to make it feel different.  The characters while having much depth don't always make me want to like them or bring them along on a mission; which in a certain respect may be a positive but I'd prefer to feel something a bit more by the end.  Maybe that is the achilles heel, that after 73 hours and credits rolled, I can say I enjoyed the journey, but this was no Mass Effect 2 or even GOTG.  Perhaps being constrained by supes that we all know and see in many medium makes that an impossible task.

I enjoy that they are making Marvel games that don't have a micro transaction tied to it. I would say that I am enjoying the game for the most part. 
Pros: Every character feels completely different from each other in regards to personality and combat ability. 
         The Abby grounds are enjoyable to explore and has its own side story to follow that doesn't take away from the main plot and ( as of now still not completed the game) feels like it can add to the main story.
         The game also has a section where you can send heroes to do missions by themselves reminding me of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood where you sent off Assassins. I like that they add this into the game because it helps getting resources a bit easier and gives the impression that those not selected for the mission you actively are in are contributing.

Cons: The initial problem with the game was booting it up. For some reason when starting the game through Steam it also opened it up in a 2K Games Launcher which heavily affected the game play and FPS was horrible. I almost uninstalled and got a refund on the game because of this. But after looking into it online, I found a small solution that cut out the middle launcher (2K Games Launcher) and opened the game up. This fixed the problem to about 90%, still some lag but nothing near game breaking.
         The biggest gripe I have with the game is the extra amount of talking in combat. To quote Falcon to Spider-man from Captain America Civil War, "" I don't know if you have been in a fight before, but there's usually not this much talking."" It's as if the developers needed to squeeze every ounce they could from the voice actors for every named and non-named character in game.
         Not a lot of variety of missions. Mostly the same 3-4 type of missions requiring the use of a different character on your team.
         While the variety of characters is nice, some of them feel very lack luster in combat. I have tried using each of them on a few different missions. Its just some are clearly not as good as others and that is disappointing.

That is not currently the case but it could be easily changed to be that way with the way it is set up.

With that said what is currently in the game is fantastic and way more enjoyable than I expected, yes it is a turn based card game at it's core but the combat isn't really just a Slay the Spire clone, it requires positioning and tactics as to how you are going to use the environment.  While I am not super deep into the game yet the combat seems to last a good amount of time where it stays long enough to not make the game feel like a visual novel with combat tacked on but short enough to not feel like it disrespects the players time either. Yes there is a lot of story and a lot of exploration between combats but it is actually fun and interesting unlike say the ""current day"" sections of older Assassin Creed games that take you out of anything enjoyable just to try to tack on a forced story (which is probably why more modern AC games have a lot less focus on that sub plot and keep you in the action more of the time)

Would I recommend this game? As long as the game doesn't become forced micro transaction hell then yes I would say it is 100% worth a purchase, but if 2k gets greedy and makes the DLC force you to spend real money to avoid unreasonable grinds then no I wouldn't, so in it's current state I would recommend the game, but that can easily change with a single patch. But let's assume that if they do get greedy they leave the base game alone and only screw with post game content grind balance to avoid backlash of post game rebalancing that would look like it was done to avoid negative metacritic scores. Is the base game without any of the DLC or skins worth the asking price? Yes the game is perfectly fine without the 4 additional heroes and fancy skins there is no reason to have to pay for any of the DLC assuming they don't do a post review rebalancing of the currency rates.

I love this game, everything from the banter to the combat, everything is well thought out and challenging enough to feel rewarding when you get through a difficult mission or challenge. I was originally afraid that because there wasn't any perma-death that it wouldn't feel good but it felt like a breath of fresh air honestly.

I would say if you like Marvel and understand that its....well marvel you will love the story. There are alot of different character dynamics you explore and characters may appear surface value one way, but when you start talking with them and forming bonds you start to see the real *peter parker* or *robbie reyes*.

The hangouts and the *persona* elements was an interesting aspect but it kinda added a bit, the banter is top tier though, stumbling across peter parker calling MJ to make sure aunt mae is ok is the type of things I want to see in a marvel game like this and I didn't disappoint.

Captain America reporting to nick fury and him getting pissed off, its like there is another world within the midnight suns, but the hunter is listening on it.

For me? The conversations and dialogue carry this game. The combat is also fun and challenging which will probably be my focus now that I've beaten the game on the dark path.

I highly recommend this game if you like marvel, but even if you don't if you like seeing characters kinda interact with each other in an interesting way along with having a combat system that is very replay heavy I would recommend this game.",1673667632,1673667632,True,1,0,0.514705896377563477,0,True,False,False

UPD(after 10 hours of play or so):
Turns out it's not that bad as it appearred. Resolving battles is pretty fun, somewhat close to XCOM, also have to give credit to director's work - action cutscenes are not as cringey as recent Marvel movies and after 5+ hours of playtime - I started to feel some epic background. Oh, and visual effects on combos are great.
As for everything - the NEED to talking in the Abbey is really annoying and decreasing temp of the game. In my case, I'm comparing with XCOM, where I could play at least 3 battle-encounters (AT LEAST) in two hours and here you can count only for 2 battle-encounters(AT MOST) in two hours. Because other time you'll need resolving some sht in the Abbey-hub, collecting essences needed for researches and other stuff, etc. And it's really frustrating, I should say.
So, in the end, it's more like ""Yes"" than ""No"", but consider the fact, that the overall temp of the game will be much lower than in XCOM. (and battles are really CAN enthrall you to play it in mode ""One more turn/resolve"" like in XCOM/CIV series, which is what I was expecting)",1672964274,1673660878,True,0,0,0.267941594123840332,0,True,False,False
