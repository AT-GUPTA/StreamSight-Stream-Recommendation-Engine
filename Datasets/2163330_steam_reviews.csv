Pros:
1. hordes of zombies
2. pretty graphic (for this type of arcade sandbox game from a small studio, I don't expect much but the graphic is surprisingly decent for this one. You can actually see the zombies swaying its arms when trying to catch you. The animation is good.)
3. highly additive 
4. got rpg element (you can lvl up a skill tree) I hope we can have a skill tree for each class too besides the general skill tree that we have now which applies to all classes.
5. combat is intense, impactful and engaging.

Suggestions:
1. Really hope that we can have more customizations for each class. e.g. skill tree, cosmetic, weapon augment etc. for each class.
2. All buff on card & skill tree should be at least 5%, now some of the 1% increase feel kind of useless.

This game is stable unlike any other games. It just doesn't crash. It works. I saw some games crashing even they are 2D, made with major engines like Unity, Unreal, etc. And I cannot be silent about Diablo IV, MW III, they were nightmares and headaches.
I'm telling that those kinds of games are crashing like Hell, often, not just sometimes.
And this game is still an early access! Actually Diablo IV was better than its released version. It just had to stay as an early access.
It's hard to see normal, standard, sane games these days. So many games are crashing, they don't work with controllers, they've got errors, bugs, faults, and they are too many, and they got paid, they keep selling. Oh, how on earth they get money with those products with so many errors!
Even NVIDIA's RTX 4090 flickers, blinks, especially with G-Sync.
Yes, it's a future we dreamed about yesterday, but is it really better than before? Cutting-edge techs, better looking, but they've got so many bugs, errors, faults than before. And it causes crashes. They cost more, they provide more errors. Is this common sense? Is this sane?
Some people said ""They are blinded, they are crazy about money."" I didn't agree, but now I agree, because I can see this, I saw.
Oh, RTX 4090 flickered again. Gotta turn off that stupid G-Sync again.
Oh, I bought ultimate editions and I haven't played Diablo IV, MW III for long time.

Pros:
+ Very Fast combat, ramps up fairly quickly and you don't feel like a snail like other games
+ Objectives constantly keep you moving around the map
+ level ups are quick and frequent
+ Can have a group up to 3 - each character is unique and adds a lot of combinations to the game play
+ Good amount of bosses - each different from the other and adds a challenge on harder difficulty

Neutral:
* Only 2 maps so far, there will be more but wish there was at least 3
* No story - Just jump right in and that's it. Just a fun shoot everything up game
* Talent tree is pretty basic, but they do help a lot
* Decent metal music, but gets repetitive when theirs only 2 tracks. It does keep you moving though

Negative:
- No base camp or hub after level complete 
- Item chests are pretty basic and only give minor stats, wish their was an epic chest or items that drastically changed the game play loop

Overall:
Great game to kill time in. Start off with one person and ramps up at a very good and fun pace.

In February 2024 I came back to check on the state of the game and I was very surprised to see they seem to have reversed direction and fixed the issues. Suddenly the game was fun again! Enough for me to enjoy the grind to work out all the achievements! 

Hence I am changing my review back to positive. I will leave the previous reviews below and rewrite for clarity once the game is finished.

The Overview:

This is a very good looking swarm survivor type game. I love the characters and the style (it feels good to play as regular soldiers and the detail on the character models is stunning). The meta progression and the game play are also excellent.

I am not really looking forward to seeing what comes next any more, although they are showing at least three new characters and several new maps coming soon and they are still working on it so I have hopes it might get fixed.

Due to earlier updates, I changed my review from recommended to wait/not recommended, and the recent updates have done nothing except confirm the negative review. The concept is excellent but with each update the game/characters/weapons get massive nerfs! That takes away the fun. e.g. The skill cool down mechanic seemed about spot on so you could get pretty low at end game when you had all meta upgrades (allows time for multiple turrets) - no idea why that needed nerfing. The Critical damage was 250% endgame with meta upgrades, that definitely did not need nerfing.

Now the second map is out, with new enemies and bosses, It is just about impossible to beat on hardcore, despite having all upgrades possible. (I have given up after several attempts)

So far 5/10 wait and see.

The Detail:

Positives:

1. Graphics/Style - The models and style are excellent.

2. Game play - You start by choosing your squad leader from the 6 available so far (some have to be unlocked) and then in the game you rescue survivors to build your squad to 3. Once the squad is full, future rescues give you a bonus level up. Along the way you also get crates dropped and opening these gives you useful upgrades.

3. Game modes - Survive until daybreak for victory - 20 minutes on normal and 10 minutes on hardcore, or chose endless mode and keep fighting until you get overwhelmed.

4. The Characters - The characters with their individual styles feel great to play and their skills match well - So far there are Swat, Tank, Engineer, Archer, Ghost (ninja), and Medic and the runs feel very different depending on who you choose.

5. The Horde - The zombie characters are varied in both their looks and their attacks, and the bosses are all similarly varied.

6. The Map - There are two so far with others promised soon, it looks fantastic and while fairly small for the genre, they are well designed. The first really feels like running around deserted streets at night, albeit a block with no buildings.
 
6. The Progression - The meta progression upgrades are well thought out with enough choice to let you determine your course according to play style, yet enough limitation to keep you hungry for more progression.

Negatives: (Note it is early access and just released so they are fixing these issues all the time)

1. Some Bugs

2. Some Evolutions - Some of the third tier weapons are weaker than their tier 2 so the level up/evolution is frustrating until you unlock a couple of banishes. this is particularly true of the archer who goes from a multi-shot bow to a cold (slow) arrow or exploding arrow, both of which are next to useless and the medic who goes from a rapid firing low damage pistol at tier 1 to a very slow firing lower damage syringe tier 3 and a choice of slow throwing flasks (very low damage cold or low damage poison) - The medic does however have the bonus of improving healing.

3. The achievement - It's Raining Men is ridiculously hard and took hours and many attempts. (might be fixed as they reduced the requirement from 20 to 10, but now there are other impossible achievements)

5. The Maps - There are only 2 and the second is nowhere near as atmospheric as the first.

6. The constant nerfing of everything into the ground, supposedly to seek balance but just spoiling what was a fun game.

7. The political propaganda - the medic has a syringe that says ""vaccinate the ones that were too afraid to take the vaccine in time"" - while I guess you could take it that you are using the vaccine to kill them, It seems to suggest the Zombies didn't take the vaccine because they were afraid when the truth is, the zombies took the vaccine precisely because THEY were afraid.

I am still looking forward to seeing what comes next and I will update this review if the game gets fixed.",1689686662,1708018718,True,0,0,0.438502639532089233,0,True,False,True

it has a slightly unique twist that you enlist the help of up to 3 survivors in total (on a single run) all with unique abilities and weapons, level meta progression of leading characters is a thing.. behoving one to level up other classes in order to bring higher firepower on runs.
each class feels unique although i don't think synergy between classes is much of a priority. each class seemed to work well with each class..... no wrong answers i guess

by the numbers buffs and power ups which everyone has probably seen before

There are a lot of similar games on the market, but this one catch my eye because the art direction is really good and it has some unique ideas like the squad, and the weapons are fantastic. If you have any doubts about that game, there is a free demo. I am glad I bought this game on EA, and since August 2023, I already played 25+ hours and finished 100% of achievements.

The devs clearly know what they are doing and are using the EA in the right way: they delivered a solid  main game loop that is bug free and well performing. I never had a crash or any slowdown during my playtime. The only thing missing and that is added with each release is more content (maps, squad members), skills, chest items, etc.

The devs do take into account player suggestions: for instance the game was not supposed to be a dual stick shooter (it is using auto-aim and auto-shoot), but since lots of players requested it, they added a dual stick mode. So this EA is also a chance to give feedback.
 
Overall, it always was a lot of fun to play, even with the limited content, and now with release 0.5.1 I totally recommend this game as it is. The patch adds a new squad mate, new items, and more importantly, new soundtracks that are really amazing.

Nevertheless, here's an edit to follow up after updates / dev response / playing some more, original review underneath.  The time played vs. when review was made is off by like 7 hours because I accidentally left the game running overnight.  In any event, the last update provided some good changes in the right direction in course-correcting, the little goober speedy zombies are less obnoxious and generally speaking the tempo for the first 20 - 25 minutes or so feels a lot better.  It's not quite as aggravating pushing up into the 70's as it had been before.

That said, there's still a very noticeable throttling / clamp on XP once you get into the higher levels and you still wind up at a point where you'll get two levels off of SOS rescues for every one you get off of actual experience.  I sat through almost an hour of endless mode trying to get to level 100 this time around and got murked at 95 -- better than it had been before the update but god that's insanely aggravating because I really don't feel like slogging another hour attempt in a mode that overstays it's welcome.

I can at least recommend the game again for general play for folks bipping by, but devs the XP throttling, while lightened up, is still really unnecessary -- I don't know who's having fun taking so longer to get actual levels later on but it still ain't me.  I'm leaving the remaining achievements on the curb -- feeding the worm 500 kills is just a grind and I have no inclination to ever attempt another > 20 minute mode again at this point.  Here's hoping they can get the sweet spot back, but personally I'm done with the game.

Original review when I'd had enough:

In short - a way overboard XP nerf kneecapped the fun out of a game that was a blast to play before.  

I like/d this game a lot, among this genre that has become my go-to a lot of the time these days, it's broadly speaking one of the better ones with a lot of promise.  For the most part, the direction of updates and polish were on the right track, so it was a good vibe.  There's a lot of good going for this game with its basic tempo, and used to be a lot better at that -- but I write this review having paused the game 45 minutes into an 'endless' run having specifically plowed through as many XP increases as I could get my hands on, reaching > 215% XP modifier, with a 383% XP base from how far into this horde I am... and the dudes are level 65.  

That doesn't mean much in a vacuum, yeah? But it used to be you'd be at that cruising altitude in basically half the time.  The thing is, in arm's length of the same updates to cripple the XP rate in this game they added achievements for hitting 75th and even 100th level in a single run.  

And I'm sat here, 45 minutes into a run with all the upgrades maxed, kiting bosses who are never going to touch me while the occasional random shitter zombie materializes to spawn and immediately chunks my party for from 1/5th to 3/5ths the party's health (which is also gigantic by now at > 2500, with almost capped out armor and damage reduction - and still getting whammied like that by the generic zombies instead of it being a boss giving me a run for my money.)  

I'm sat here wondering what I'm even doing at this point, when the whole hook to this genre of game is A) dependably quick and tidy shots of fast-paced and fun blowing-up-everything-on-the-screen and B) running down achievements -- when at this rate I may as well watch a show on another monitor while I kite more zombies for how long to get those last two?  

Man I get that your goal is trying to keep the game challenging or keep its longevity going, but it was a lot more fun before these recent changes and really sours the bits of good new content that were added recently.  Please, do something about the gollum-looking fast zombie goobers who blend in with the terrain gibbing your team when they spawn being way more dangerous than any boss or elite on the map -- and please, for the love of god, revert the XP change because this is just stupid.",1704937637,1706739634,True,0,0,0.690531432628631592,0,True,False,True

[b][h2]Gameplay[/h2][/b]YAZS stands out in being a squad-based bullet-heaven, in each run you can have up to 3 different survivors whose weapons and abilities you can upgrade. There are currently 6 survivors in the game, each of them completely unique from one another.

I love the upgrade system during runs, all survivors have weapons and abilities, weapons can be evolved at max level with a choice of 2 at max rank. Abilities can also be upgraded and its fun to pick and choose survivors that work well together. You can also loot items for certain stats and effects.

There are only 2 maps in the current version of the game, each have different enemies, bosses and events. Given how early into development it is, I am hopeful for a lot more maps. Each map also has 5 total gamemodes.

The meta-progression is fairly light at the moment. You can unlock new abilities for characters by playing with them. You can also upgrade a variety of stats in the skills page, these are currently really easy to max out so I'm hoping for more as the game develops.

[b][h2]Achievements (88/88)[/h2][/b]All items and achievements in this game have video game/media references making it a lot more fun to read through your unlocks. The achievements themselves are fun and challenging, my guide will help you through them.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3006467623
[b][h2]Music/sound[/h2][/b]There are only a couple songs but I do really love what's currently in the game, they're awesome to jam out to while slaying the undead.

[b][h2]Settings/Accessibility/Misc[/h2][/b]A few language options (more on full release). All graphics settings have super useful example pictures. toggleable auto-fire. Manual aim that can be switched between full squad and leader only.

[b][h2]TL;DR[/h2][/b]Early but promising squad-based bullet-heaven, fun to combo different survivors. With 3D visuals standout to the genre. A bunch of gamemodes. Lots of video game/media references. Fun and challenging achievements.

This gives the game a fun atmosphere while still dripping in horror atmosphere. The gameplay is smooth and the visuals keep me engaged after multiple runs of the same map on different difficulties.

The developers have also been pretty consistent with adding features to enhance the game without throwing off balance or feeling cheap. While certainly parties are definitely more effective, no character feels unnecessary or inferior to others. They all serve a purpose.

With a few more maps and some creative challenges, this game could become an S-Tier bullet hell game. As is, a solid A-Tier.

Issues and feedback:
You can deduct points after unlocking higher tiers from previous tiers, even if it means you wouldn't have enough to get the next tier upgrade (which you already put points into).
Not clear what does skip do exactly? Just not getting any reward? Does it lower required xp for next? Otherwise there's no reason to pick it...
Why can you banish only 1 item on level up? Also, would be nice if you got something else when banishing a powerup
The no ability achievement counts even something passive as critical hit from hunter... So the question is, with the new passive perks, can you still use them for that challenge?
For crits, it isn't clear what damage type got critical hit since it's the same color for all.
Sadly there are no elemental reactions between different elements.
Both the boss mode and One hit mode don't award anything.
It's not clear whether progression upgrades can  be used for Zero Deaths! while I did, while also getting life steal passives.
Can't turn off auto fire, just says Autom Fire On when pressing the hotkey. Also, why are there multiple movement in actions if you already have 2 options for each.
The 3rd tier for each character requires to kill too many zombies, it just gets boring to farm like that for next upgrades, also too many achievements require you to do them in default mode, it gets boring to wait those 20 mins when you can easily complete it with enough upgrades/unlocks.",1705739858,1705739858,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Levels feel good, the characters all feel different and unique, and I like that it's military for a ""Vampire Survivors"" style game.

Edit:
The updates are 50/50. The addition to the military training was great, needed a huge buff, and then got it. Altering the buffs from the box are kinda not that good. If you give me +10% damage with weapons, but take 10% from ability damage, then there's the reverse of it...it's not doing anything. Just wasting the box. The only reason it's worth while is because it also gives +5% crit chance, so why not just add the box with +5% crit to weapons or abilities? Or do +10% and -5%? Just doesn't feel good. 

The nerf to main weapons and xp feels bad too. I liked the changes to abilities for the most part and I understand the reasoning, but still, the nerf to some weapons and abilities is kinda lame when others weren't buffed, or if they were you still can't tell...I'm looking dead ass at you grenade launcher. 

Elemental damage is weaksauce...

The current iteration is already a blast.  The way you decide what abilities to combine (adding squad mates) is unique and a fun way to approach the different combinations.   Each squad mate feels unique and fresh.  I would like to see maybe adding a 4th squad mate once the last two are added to the game.

Some characters are still not fully fleshed out and need some balancing work - the elemental aspects also seem bare-bones without much uniqueness (what's the difference between chemical and fire DoT?).

While I like the system where abilities and weapons are two different systems, the balance between the two is way off.  The progression of a squad mate is: level 1-> basic weapon/abilities, level 2-> new weapons, level 3-> new abilities.  This makes for an odd transition since at level 2 you'll always want to go with weapons.

The overall balance between abilities and weapons needs to be reworked, 9/10 times I always go for weapons, because they can be ""evolved"" (if we're using VS lingo) while abilities can't, they can just be maxed out.  I think this would work if a squad mate had 4 or 5 levels instead of the 3 and each level you could upgrade each ability further.

While the skill tree is fine (it's nothing unique, but adequate), the way power-ups and chests are handled could be better.  Some of the balance is also way off.  For example, +2.5% crit chance is WAY better than +2.5% crit damage, but they are both ""common"" upgrades.

So that's my main feedback - terrific foray into a genre that has become over-saturated since Vampire Survivors hit it big,",1705596957,1705596957,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- Grind based challenge. Not that much movement or strat based challenge.
- Overpowered weapons/passives/skills are locked behind a grind wall.
- Very unbalanced; weapon builds are the best in the game, skills suck late game.
- Because weapons are overpowered and meta, every tier 3 weapon has only one viable choice. 
- Because skills suck, some characters are literally one viable weapon and passive characters. This also makes some characters unviable eg. medic, which becomes useless after you upgrade hp regen in the skill tree.
- Lackluster enemy designs. They're zombies which you've seen before alright.
- Gameplay is mainly about moving around the map while you brainlessly pick weapon and crit related pick ups.
- Hitboxes are wonky so careful skill based movement is hard. Sometimes you think you won't get hit, you'll get hit.
- One shot giants bosses can one shot kill you out of screen because you can't see their charge indicator because of the visual clutter.

-/+ Kinda doesn't matter whether you go weapon or elemental meta builds. In the end they feel the same because you'll end up running around the map.

+ Team based gameplay and builds are cool.

it’s a Bullet Heaven against zombies chose 1 leader to start, chose 2 more characters from 7 others to your group for 10-20 minutes.

it’s a Bullet Heaven Game with 3 characters with their own abilities and Weapons. Half of the abilities are pretty much for the first 20 minutes and other half can be helpful from a long way match.

- item Chest Chest

Pros IMO;
First things first, for its genre, the graphics and the style is absolutely top. It sinks you into the game for sure. There is an upgrade tree with your classic stats like more exp, more pull, more hp, more hp regen so on so on. Maps are not unlimited, BUT for sure big enough.  UI is nice and simple. Sounds are satisfying. (this was very important for me personally) You will get your hour for buck if you are into this genre of games. Characters are interesting enough visually. I also really like that zombies drop limited boosters. I like that the game keeps you actively walking around the map as well.

Cons IMO; 
I'm aware its an early access game but, i think some of the characters -as far as the skills/weapons go- feel so unfinished. You know how you get that nirvana satisfaction feeling in vampire survivors at some point of your run, where u walk through enemies and it feels like you are being rewarded by the god himself? I never really hit that feeling in this game UNLESS i played 2 specific characters with specific weapons and upgrades. [spoiler]swat:AR - tank: Minigun with crit-attack speed build. Third survivor doesn't even matter. And it sucks if i choose to use rocket launcher or sniper rifle, i will not experience a satisfying game play.[/spoiler] I feel like vampire survivors does this part really good. Even having so many characters and weapons to play with in vampire survivors, they still manage to make it satisfying at some point of your run. The skills in this game are also nice and creative BUT sadly except a couple of em, they are also very unsatisfying to pick or play with. (Grenades mostly... Don't even see them visually.)
ANYWAY, again, i am aware it is an early access game and that there is so much room for improvement AND i do hope they improve and continue developing this game. It has so much potential...

When me and my hubby first tried the game on the demo version, the game started a bit slow and boring for about 1 hour. Then it got better and more interesting over the 3 hours we sank into the demo. And we decided to buy the game. so far 25+3 hours play time and we are still actively playing (so many achievements to unlock). Overall worth our money, fun game, good visuals, good sounds, just missing a bit of oomph with the weapons and skills.

+Immersive setting and choice of gear as well as gadgets
+Very pleasing camera angle, movement and gunplay
+The ""3 char"" squad gameplay, in which every char aims and works kinda on his own but still hitting the teamwork is absolutely FIRE. Love that!
+Hitting and dealing damage has lots of weight to it, very satisfying
+Bosses look really good
+Ragdoll anis on basic mobs <3
+Many QoL aspects that are kinda obligatory for this genre are already there which is amazing (ex aimbotting)
+Unlocking new weapons and perks on chars is VERY motivating and got huge impact
+I like the mission system with various objectives and the progression bound to it, thats cool!

+- The soundtrack in the lobby and basic city mission is top quality, absolutely amazing. All the other tracks are generic and dull tho. So going with a 50/50 here.

-Lacking content in pretty much any aspect, need to build onto that!
 Enemies   More Missions    Enemy and Boss variety     More maps     More chars    More lvl up upgrades
-abilities feel for the most part kinda useless rn, stacking all into guns is the way to go
-for some reason the tank has more dps and impact than like nearly every other class which feels weird
-the difficulty in 90% of modes isnt dodging our outscaling huge waves or bosses but being suddenly oneshot because mob damage seems to scale up like crazy the longer the mission goes on

When I was two achievements away from 100% the game the new update came through. The update was a welcome relief, yes they made changes to XP, weapons, abilities, and elements. They also made the game feel truly, ""endless"". I did 100% the game in about 35 hours of game play, though after 100% the game, I noticed that I came back to it. Though it does not have a ""story"" like ""Hades"" this is still a great game to chill out to and game.

In my personal opinion this game has the potential to rival ""Hades"" and ""Vampire Survivor"". 

To the developers,
As a side note, I have been gaming since I was child, I am now 39 years old. My 12 year old loves this game as well. My son did say that he would like to see a character like ""chemical engineer"" a playable character that only has elemental damage but you have to choose one of three branches, fire, ice, or chemical.

Pros:
- The combat loop is a ton of fun which is a mix of brotato and vampire survivors
- Combining three ""survivors"" into your team can make some interesting synergies (sniper for one, aoe explosive bows, gattling gun)
- Playing a survivor for longer means you can get access to fun abilities
- While I think the most recent patch (.50) went back in some ways it's clear the dev is interested in trying new things and there is passion in the work
- The soundtrack absolutely slaps

Cons
- No synergies on abilities. One of my favorite thing in these games is combing abilities or working with other abilities to awesome effect thus getting that feeling of being powerful. Dev said it's coming but it's not here yet
- XP got nerfed thus mandating that you banish many abilities that could be fun so that you can get all your weapons to max level. Reduces build diversity
- Too many useless items. 1% damage? Not worth it

Picked this game up on sale - discounted off of its already cheap price. I was not disappointed.

At first I thought this was the typical 'run around and see how long you can survive' zombie game. I was pleased to discover that I was mistaken.

A variety of characters, each with their own weapons, rank-ups, special abilities, and skills. Characters to unlock as well. There are different maps that present new zombies and environmental challenges. Tired of the typical survive 20 minutes game mode? No problem! There are others to try as well.

For the price, on sale or not, you won't be sorry you picked up this little gem. It's simple, yet has enough variety that kept me playing to see what else I could unlock and see which combination of characters worked the best together. A fun little game to burn time and not get sucked into a story line or say 'just one more turn'.",1704953376,1704953376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

it does all the good things and none of the BS that a lot of people try to shove into the genre: 

all the weapons auto aim
upgrades and powerups galore
no dodging, no dodge fest simulator - you live and die by the upgrades you get and how well you path through the mobs as it should be

the game also has a nice new mechanic with you choosing the members of the team, thus pre-choosing the possible weapons and upgrades.
it makes the game fresh but also familiar
lots of different monsters/zombies, weapon effects are well done and do not limit your ability to see what's going on (something a lot of members of this genre have issues with)

It's Dead Nation for cell phones. 

I got the game on sale. it's early access, so I won't be too hard on it. 

I liked the combination of different characters. 
Each characters ability is different enough from each other and weapon routes give the game a lot of diversity. 

That being said, the stages are just a square. That made it kinda boring for me. 
Even getting the second stage available, while the mechanics vary and make it more challening, I really didn't feel it was enough. 

An actual map would be cool. 
An objective would be cool. 

All game modes are pretty much the same... wait for the time to run out = win. 

But, it's still in early access. So I hope the developers turn the feedback into a better experience. 

I'd say, for the price, yeah, get it. Even at full price it's really not expensive. 
Support the genre and have fun.

Pros:
- slaying a lot of zombies
- own spin with the ""have a team of 3 characters"" that have ""unique"" abilities
- there are some funny puns in the game 

Cons:
- There are barely any classes so far which makes almost every run feel the same
- The game feels the same between minutes 4-19 where you just do the same thing over and over again with very little change (in terms of power ups, gameplay loop, etc)
- generally the synergies just aren´t really there. Max out main weapon, upgrade, do the same for your other 2 chars
- the abilities don´t scale at all/aren´t balanced properly (steroids having too long cd for what they do)
- it lacks that scratching of the itch (e.g. Brotato, Vampire Survivors, Halls of Torment, ... all do that in their way - this game doesn´t)

Solutions:
1) Add more classes
2) Re-scale the abilities (make them scale with time, power-ups, SOMETHING)
3) Flesh out the progress tree (You can play for 5 hours and have all the decent perks)
4) Add some sort of synergy system that feels meaningful (the current ones are just bland and boring)
5) Add more enemy types (there are very few different enemy types in the game)
6) Re-balance the ""wave system"". As mentioned before minute 5-19 feels exactly the same, you run around, usually barely get hit, which makes most regen perks sort of pointless. Then suddenly the whole map is flooded and you die very quickly if hit. Feels super frustrating and boring to not be challenged before the very last minute, just to lose there.
7) Add some ""long term reward system"" that feels impactful, rewarding to progress and not easily obtainable
8) ""Add a little bit of spice"" (and by a little bit, I mean a lot) - the game maybe has potential but right now if just feels bland.

Pros:
- Fun and Easy to Control. No need to aim much
- Graphics appealing, great zombie apocalyptic atmosphere 
- 20 minute games (if playing normal)
- Talent Trees/Upgrade System, Progressive

Cons
- Lack of Tooltips for skills when selecting class 
- Lacks replay-ability at the moment, since some maps, classes and Tier 3 skills are still not released yet
- Class/Team Synergy, almost forces the player to go a certain build to be efficient almost like making a cookie cutter build.
- Archer Class felt lacking, it just didnt feel as impactful, especially if paired with other classes like Tank. not saying that it is not good, just when you make a team of three, it just feels like Archer does nothing since slows dont really make a huge difference in the game play or you choose delayed damage where it does nothing since the other two classes will probably just kill the boss or zombies before your arrows explode.
- Medic (I know its a healer class) but it just feels like the Damage over Time skills or Slows just is a waste, since neither feel impactful enough that it is worth investing into since big hard hitting crits seem to be the best option overall.

Suggestions
- Wish there were more tooltips in class selection menu for the skills to describe what they did.
- Wish there were some built in passives for classes when you unlock Tier 2 or 3 for each class, for example, it would be really cool if the Gunner got ricochet bullets just as a built in passive once you got to tier 2.
- Wish single target weapons/skills felt more impactful, for example, the sniper rifle could have been a baretta and it creates a shockwave that did AoE damage that increases in size with skill level.
- Wish Damage Talents in the Tree felt more impactful, could not really tell if the points made a difference or not especially at start of the game.
- It feels like after a certain time, the player damage scaling plateaus while the enemy scaling continues to rise and it makes endless runs kind of pointless and not as fun and feel not as rewarding because you can only improve so far while the enemies only get stronger. You continue to level up and get money to get more talent points but then you max out your talent tree and buy everything and after that you just get nothing much out of it, its either money or health or skip....

I'd say you can get a good 6-8hrs of gameplay before you've seen most of the game, with maybe another 10 hours more to fully grind and unlock everything.

I love the squad gameplay and experimenting with different team member combos.

My biggest complaints would be 1) Abilities scale horribly. They really need to have higher levels or something. Even early on, most of them are terrible compared to just leveling up your weapons. The utility focused abilities are much better.

2) Balance. Especially certain level 3 weapons, some of them do less damage than their level 2 weapons.. And everyone's damage is pretty much an absolute joke next to the Swat's Assault rifle.

Looking forward to future updates!

the only thing I am not a fan of is the music.

At the moment there are six different survivors so you have tons of possibilities to change your playstyle. With further progress you unlock more abilities (each survivor has four at the moment) and perks to rack up your stats, like more luck, more crit damage, reload time, etc. In addition you find addons during a run to beef up the stat sheet. 

There are different play modes in addition to the regular one, namely boss run or hardcore e.g. The balancing works pretty well, each mission feels manageable and not unbeatable. 

For now there are two maps, which are basically a squared place, so the difference is only in the visuals. The enemies on the contrary differ from map to map and therefore let you rethink your playstyle.  

I played the demo for roundabout three hours and found it convincing. The game feels great, controls are nice (and customizable. like changing autofire or autoaim), all in all it is a great way to waste your time.

It was my first time playing a game from the Reverse Bullet Hell - Survival Horde - Roguelike genre and honestly trying out new build paths to beat my previous records and hunting for achievements kept me coming back for more.

Difficulty isn't too much of a challenge as long as you get the hang of dodging enemy attacks and memorizing their movement and attack patterns, however, luck also plays a huge role depending on the classes you use.

In my opinion, further balancing for each of the classes' skill set, as well as damage output and utility would improve build diversity, as right now I find myself going for either the ""Engineer, Tank & Medic"" or ""Ghost, Huntress & Swat"" combos for both achievement hunting and Endless Mode.",1701434849,1701435019,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

That being said, I know it's still being developed but one big issue I have is that main weapons are way more powerfull than characcter abilities - basically it's a rush to evolve your main weapon to the max (except for medic - her first weapon does more damage than second or third)  and ignore most of the skills - Ghost, Medic have better abilities, but overall - you want to max out the weapons of your characters asap, and then you can mostly ignore the abilities untill you run out of stuff to level up.... which is a waste, some skills are fine, but most are a waste of points - they need to be either buffed or get more level ups. 
20 minutes run are the perfect time to not get boring and difficulty ramps up nicely. The game could use bigger bosses or maybe some more events during runs, but overall the concept of building a three-man team is fun and new... I hope there are items to equip in the future. The Training room needs more content - I've only played for 6 hours but already I maxed up all the important training options, and I'm left with mostly meaningless buffs (like ability cooldown / damage, invulnerability frames after hit and stuff like armor - which is pretty meaningless because the amount od damage from bossess overshadows any damage reduction due to armor - this needs more content, maybe a separate option for environmental buffs or handicaps you could enable? Like more or less chests, more or less bosses, tougher enemies, more drops, longer buffs etc etc. At this moment  - I don't have a big incentive to gather more money during run - because there is nothing I'm  dying to train asap. 
Finally some animations could use a little extra touch - the Ghost runs weird - his movements don't correspond to actual speed of walking - looks like he is running in zero gravity or slow motion. The medic has the same animation as the Swat, stuff like that. I encountered just one bug - when I played with the tank and died early on - the ending screen had a bunch of 1 and 0s  in the text box - and that's pretty much it . 
Looking forward to playing more of this game as it develops. 
As for final 3 characters - I would love a flame thrower guy, a grenade / molotov thrower and some kind of a machine - like a tank or an armed vehicle - this would be great. That being said, I'm going back to grind some final upgrades. 
Oh, and one final note to the devs - remember, just because some weapons are better than others - it's never a good idea to nerf stuff, it's better to buff the underpowered weapons. Swarm Grinder and even Halls of Torment have recently nerfed some skills  - and they game suffers because of this. I don't even want to play Swarm Grinder anymore because it's no longer fun.

The same essentially style of game where you choose a character and play various modes to survive. All while picking up and earning new items and upgrades. 

One cool thing about this game is as you play, you can pick up two two more characters that join your group and also kill zombies. You don't have to pick anymore people mind you and just instead skip it and earn some money and XP. And you can pick up and earn upgrades for them also! Which means there are many combinations of people to try and out, along side their abilities and weapons. 

To note this game is autofire. No firing yourself. Which I find more helpful as the game goes on and its hard to keep up with all the enemies. And the autofire will often try to attack the deadliest enemy first. 

As for upgrades/unlocks. How it works is if you play as someone you usually have a starting weapon and two starting abilities (one offensive, one defensive). If you kill a certain amount of enemies through some play throughs, you unlock the next stage of weapons for your character to use in future runs. 

For example one character  uses a shotgun. Your only upgrade is to an auto shotgun. But if you unlock the first stage of weapons, you can upgrade it during a run to a minigun or a rocket launcher. Said character also had a second stage to unlock which calls in air strikes every 30 seconds. There is also a third stage of weapon/ability unlocks but those are not available yet as the game is in early access. It should be noted all these weapons/abilities can be upgraded as you level up for better damage, more ammo...etc. 

The defensive and offensive skill abilities are hit or miss. It really depends on how you chose to play and with what character combos. Most abilities spawn every ""X"" amount of time. None of them follow you. There are all stationary abilities usually (such as a turret). Again, you can upgrade them in the run though to shorten the respawn time of them, the damage, the radius...etc. 

There is money in the game also, it is used to train. Basically a skill tree. More damage, more money, more xp, run faster....etc. 

Additionally there is an achievement system in game that unlocks more stuff. Such as perks. Perks (like in Crimsonland) that give you more things to choose form when you level up. Like 5% more damage, 2 points health regeneration...etc. Some high end perks can only be unlocked through some hard achievements. 

Because the game is in early access, the content isn't complete just yet. You do get 6 characters (you unlock over time) to play and two weapon/ability unlocks for each.  There is also only one level, but said level has a simple ""Play until time runs out and its morning"", ""Endless play"" where you last as long as you can, and a hardcore mode. There is much more stuff in the future that will be added and the games gets updated REALLY often. 

I really don't have an complaints. Feels like a Crimsonland game. Though if you played the companies other Zombie games, this is not like them in some ways. Heck, as of typing this (July 23rd), you can either but this game for $9.99, or buy the bundle for $9.59 which includes this game and the other three games the company made. Which I do enjoy!

This has a modern feel with soldiers, shot-gunners, medics, engineers, a hunter and a ninja type. At least that is what I was able to unlock so far.
As per the genre you get points to apply buffs for your future runs so the game gets progressively easier? Well at first it is very hard to survive so yes the buffs points make the game get easier but that is the point of the game, survive the scenario maps.
No story or such as is par for the course in this genre.
Auto aim and auto attack are enabled by default but you can turn them off...good luck. The game moves at a fast pace. You younger folk might do fine like this but I am old, so..

I'm glad I gave this a chance.

I'd say this is easily one of the greats. Not as much randomness to runs - but that's on account of your survivors each having their own unique spread of weapons and abilities, which only continue to broaden as you unlock new tiers by racking up kills with them.

You get up to 3 survivors in a team, so you decide what blend of skills you find in your upgrade pool. On top of crates that contain a more conventional set of randomized items to multiply your characters's stats.

The combat keeps you mobile with regular civilians and chests popping up on your map that you have to liberate, along with specialists and bosses that regularly spawn and complicate your position.

The gameplay itself is solid, engaging players with a variety of tactical options. Graphically, the game meets expectations, providing a suitable backdrop for the zombie-infested environment.

However, the game suffers from an overreliance on certain meta strategies, which can make the experience feel somewhat restrictive after a while. The stability is commendable, but the game could benefit from more content to keep the experience fresh.

The real challenge, and sometimes frustration, comes from not always knowing where the next attack will come from. It’s like playing hide and seek with zombies, except they're really good at hiding and even better at seeking. And while I have no groundbreaking ideas to make the combat more transparent, a little more clarity wouldn't hurt.

""Yet Another Zombie Survivor"" can feel a bit monotonous over time, but it's perfect for achievement hunters who get a kick out of unlocking every little thing. It’s like collecting stamps, but instead of stamps, it’s zombie heads. If you’re looking for a game that blends team-based strategy with a zombie apocalypse theme, keep an eye on the change log for updates that might spice things up. And hey, if you find it on sale, why not give it a shot? It might just be the zombie-slaying, team-managing, achievement-hunting game you never knew you needed.",1700694518,1700694518,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Great presentation. The models look nice, there is a clear style, the game is readable (which is an issue in other survivor games due to clutter), and the sounds are decent.

Great progression. It offers meta progression through skill points (money), survivor progression through number of kills, and smooth in-run progression.

Basically, I really love that these matches can be one, two, or three survivor(s). There's a lot of toying with synergies between the survivors and that makes runs feel very different. There are a few heroes to unlock right now and they even unlock new weapons and skills along the way. The leader system makes you try different things, too.

I really enjoy the skills, too. A cymbal clanging money that taunts?! A helicopter fly-by that you can actually see?! Love 'em!

There's only one map right now which can be a bit boring, but clearly there are more planned. I can't really fault an early access game for that. The game makes a wonderful first impression and if you like survivor games you're going to love this one.

I recently tried out 5 games in the same style, Army of Ruin, Brotato, Soulstone Survivors, Spirit Hunters & Yet Another Zombie Survivors.  These games are all $10 or less, and I got them all on sale. (Brotato is on sale for $3.99 at the time of this review).

All of these games provided enough fun to justify their purchase, but the two that stuck out to me were SoulStone Survivors & Yet Another Zombie Survivors.  Both of these games were easier to jump right into and start having fun with.  YAZS was not as polished as some of the others, but I think it has great potential for the future, and is a lot of fun to play right now.

I really like the aesthetics of the game.  While a lot of other Vampire style games go for a fantasy setting, I enjoy the military commando style the game utilizes.  I got the game on sale, and it is certainly worth the small amount of money I spent on it.

You've got some perks to unlock, different weapons and abilities to use and tons of zombies to kill.
Additionally, three different boss types. That's basically it. 

Somehow I still had a lot of fun playing this.

All classes make sense if you use them right, and depending on how you combine them, you can easily unlock most achievements quickly. The only one that didn't work for me was ""It's Raining Men"".

Graphics, performance and animations are fine.

What bothered me about it was:

The annoying and monotonous music loop, wish there was some variety.
The mouse cursor will not disappear in the game. 
That we currently cannot manually aim our weapons. The game does this automatically.
The most disappointing by far is that there's currently no co-op or multiplayer and only two maps. 

Since this is just early access, I hope they will add more maps, gamemodes, and 1-4 player coop in the future.

Graphics are great, if downright laggy at times, particularly toward end of level, but even if/when it starts dipping down to 10fps, it's still not horrible if a bit frustrating (and this is with a 3080rtx!).  

Part of what I love is the soundtrack friggin' rocks! Brotato has a great soundtrack, but even with only two they rock and I find myself headbanging to them while playing. I came to see if there was a soundtrack available but no, and started debating recording the songs and making a loop myself as I find them stuck in my head for days at at time, particularly the desert. 

Definitely need to add a soundtrack for sale once you get more than two levels, I'm looking forward to more levels from the composer here and curious what other music they've done!

Really looking forward to new content for this, and hopefully some optimization!

 - health regen stat is absolutely useless - it is not enough to make an impact either in early on late game and even if you invest stats by the late game you're already 1 or 2 hits and it takes a million year to regen anything. 

- not the biggest fan of having to stand on top of a power up for a few seconds before you are able to get it. Especially during late game where you are dead in 1 hit - it throws me off of my momentum and can be disorienting at times. 
I've unlocked probably 90% of all the upgrades in 11 hours. That 11 hours was really fun, I just hope they could dish out more content in the future.

Improves on the Vampire Survivors formula with some refinements, like ""recruiting"" up to two other survivors onto your squad and being able to upgrade their weapons and abilities.

Like the other reviewer, I wish there was a more neutral rating available. I will rate the game as it currently is, and re-review it as it gets closer to being complete, in the context of other games both in this genre and closely related ones.

The good:
1. Great modern graphics and runs reasonably well. I'm so tired of the absolute spam of ""pixel art style"" games.

2. Some novel aspects like the recruiting survivors mechanism which helps give players control over their builds. I think the limited map size can be turned around into useful positioning features too, later in development.

3. Devs are actively working on the game and communicating, and have a pretty solid track record.

4. A bit controversial take, but I think the pricing is fair. There is currently a strange race-to-the-bottom pricing war in this genre, especially amongst the ""pixel art style"" games which I suspect, to put it as nicely as possible, are easier to (re-)produce to a minimally ""viable"" state and get listed. Those models are not sustainable, and hurt both devs and waste players time.

The bad:
1. The vast majority of abilities are functionally useless. They activate once every business month, to let out a fart that annoys zombies within smelling distance. Zombies are almost never within this smelling distance unless you are milliseconds away from dying. There are like 3 useful abilities in the game, mostly passive stat boosts or essentially a 2nd main weapon. Also please remove periodic buffs. In games like this, players have no agency over when they are active or useful, inconsistency SUCKS.

2. The majority of skill point upgrades and item container upgrades are also functionally useless. They're like 5% damage, 5% reload speed, and they're infrequent enough due to the dilution pool that it'll never reach noticeable levels. Come on. 

3. Pacing issues. Early meta progression is practically non-existent, related to above point. Within each round, exp level progression falls off a cliff around level 30 onwards. 

4. Balance/Clarity issues. There are some projectiles which chunk like 1000+ dmg. Could be dodged early game, but in the late game spam impossible to see. I'm pretty sure enemy damage universally scales up, these curves need granular attention. Some classes have level 3 weapons which are functionally worse than level 2.",1699674600,1699674600,False,1,0,0.507129251956939697,0,True,False,True

Yet Another Zombie Survivors is a pretty good take on the horde survival genre. I enjoyed the unique characters with different weapons and abilities, also how you can pick any 3 to create your dream team. 

Where this game excels is the graphics (really gorgeous visuals), the game engine (no abrupt frame drops in high intensity situations) and the team building aspect. 

Where the game falls a bit short is the “samey”ness, every run feels exactly the same. I’ve got 7.3hrs logged and I’m already getting bored with the same content. Mobs are mostly the same on the two available maps. Hopefully this improves with the journey through early access. Another shortcoming is the characters are not balanced and there is a clear build to succeed each time after you’ve looked at dps for a few runs. 

Overall it’s a fun one to try out, a bit in the expensive side (most horde survivals are ~$5) but I would say I’ve gotten worthwhile fun out of getting it for $8 on sale.

What separate auto-attack games imo is the feedback and the builds you can have.
The visual and sound feedback is good and quite sastifying.
unfortunately at the time of writing this, the build is not. each character builds feel lack luster.
you have main weapon that have 2 mutually exclusive end game path and 2 skills with only power incremental and later another 2 unlock-able.
so once you unlock everything it get stale fast.

in the end I find this game quite fun so a thumb up.
minor caveat. This game somehow doesn't do well with my CPU (R5 3600) being a game with hundreds of entities active on the screen I understand that gonna put heavy work on CPU, But other game with 3d graphic like soul stone survivor never drop my FPS this hard , constantly 50-70 ""fluctuating"" fps is frustrating sometime.

Remember the fun upgrade games of the Kongregate era? That is EXACTLY what this is. Just, you know, more modern, and not a streaming game. I know, you all have other genre names you use for this game. It's an upgrade game. And that is not a bad thing. 

Quick run down. I won't bore you. 

There is ZERO story here. It's not needed. This is a run around and kill zombies game. 
Upgrades include in game non permanent as well as earned ""training"" permanent upgrades you can spend after a run.  

Achievements give rewards. Almost everything you do in this game has some reward attached to it. So you never feel like you are just ""grinding"", or wasting time. I am only 3 hours in as of this writing, and have felt a fair amount of progression, enough to keep me hooked and playing, but not so much that it feels too easy or boring. 

I won't bother telling you what kind of game this is. You can read, it's in the description. What I CAN tell you, is this game is fun and very well made. If you like upgrade games, because again that's what this is, you will LOVE this game. Buy it. It's fun. 

NOTE FOR DEVS.. a couple of quality of life suggestions. 

In the achievement screen, it would be nice to be able to hover over rewards and see what they are and what they do. This can assist in the strategy of what achievements you go for first. 

Also, I feel like when you get the SOS, and choose to send to bunker, on top of the money and level, there should also be a moderate heal. Sometimes you fight through swarms to get there, so a heal reward would make it that much more satisfying to reach it. Not a full heal or anything crazy, but like 150 -250 health points would still be very useful, especially if you are almost dead. 

Lastly, maybe a (optional) 2 or 3 screen tutorial explanation of how elements work in the game. Experience, money, and some of the more key pick up items on the field. Going in really blind can be frustrating for a new player, if they don't know what things do or what to go for. 

Happy to give this game a HUGE thumbs up. Runs great for this type of game, not buggy, super fun, easy to play no complicated menus or learning curve required. Just jump in and start blasting. Buy it. Honestly this is the most fun game I have bought on Steam in quite awhile.

I really dig these types of games, but I do wish the hit boxes were a bit more shaped like the characters. The only reason I say that is because a Zombie will swing at a vacant part of the circle and you still take damage lol. it happens in other games like this as well so I think it's just this style of game, but that's really the only problem I can think of.

Pros
- Smooth gameplay - controls feel responsive and keys are mapped similar to other games in the genre.
- Nice looking and pretty cool settings; though I wish you could weave through buildings in a city and really pump up the volume of the hoards.
- Pretty awesome music - and it doesn't get overly redundant because the matches are short.
- The 2nd map changes up the normal formula in an interesting way. Tremors sort of way.
- Zombies and guns = what more could you need? (Answer: A bit more it would appear)
- Potatos.

Cons
- Some of the characters, full upgraded, feel like they just cannot go all the way even with a good supporting cast. See other point below.
- Upgrades feel insignificant both in game and the general account wide ones bought from main menu.
- Supply drops don't feel very rewarding - outside of happiness and a couple others.
- Endless maps are not needed at this stage because by the time you can survive past the 40ish min mark, you have unlocked everything in the game already. You cannot infinitely upgrade your characters and eventually you just collect money on level ups - but there is nothing to spend it on after everything is unlocked.
- The game fails to really fulfill what makes the genre so attractive in terms of scaling your power and thinking through options until you become nearly godlike. It tends to fall down to a specific buildout every time (I wont mention it as to avoid spoiling but its not hard to figure out once everything is unlocked.)
- As of now, it is not worth the price tag. As others have pointed out, there are far better bargains for the money that will fit the Bullet Hell genre feel better.",1697754372,1697754485,False,81,4,0.743397772312164307,0,True,False,True

Anyway, let's lay the cards on the table and just say this is not a AAA game, same for the price tag, graphically the game is very appealing, I didn't have any issues with performance, I'm running  a 1080Ti and everything is smooth even when the game get's ultra crowded. 
It's a fun game for a few hours, I have close to 38h and was able to unlock everything that the game has available to unlock at the moment. 
Gameplay wise, the RNG does it for me, it's fun having to deal with the unfortunate crappy upgrades or the fact that you don't get the class you wanted, it's all part of the challenge. yes there are some useless upgrades and some stuff could be tweaked but all in all you can go through the game with ease, I tend to build for a lot of AoE, Crit Dmg, Fire Rate etc..and seems to work all the time, even in Hardcore.

My personal opinion is, some classes could be reworked, I find Huntress and Medic a bit underpowered compared to the other classes, where Ghost is the star of the game combined with either Swat or Tank.
But again they still due to implement the 3rd rank of skills so it might change for the future.

As I said, you will go through the game quickly, and once you unlock all the upgrades you pretty much done, at least I was, but the value for me is, it's a game I have in my favourites on my Steam Library, and when they slowly introduce new content or patch I like to give it a go, and even sometimes I just jump in to kill some Zombies.

Visually very pleasing. If you have engineer companion with laser auto-targeting on 4k HDR it may cause blindness, but it was completely worth sacrificing my vision to view the laser bounce from enemy to enemy.

There are currently 6 classes that can each be leveled twice, with the 3rd upgrade tier on the way. Swat class feels OP, although I would argue the strongest as a companion, as you have to aim with your starting class and then gain another max 2 companions which auto targets enemies. Ghost class can be used as your main class for a complete hands off experience, which can be quite satisfying.

I hope to see some additional enemies added and more evolving as the timer progresses. To beat the normal game mode you need to survive for 20 minutes, which makes the runs nice and short compared to many other survivor games. Some additional enemy types would be great for endless mode.

The map(s) is rather small, so exploring all of it happens rather fast. More locations are also on the way, but I would prefer focus to be on enemy variety.

All in all, I give this a solid 5/7",1694527122,1697565387,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Interesting branching skill trees for each survivor. It's clearly still lacking content [being early access] but I'm really liking the foundation that the developers have built so far. 

I only have a few criticisms from what I've seen so far:
- The game is a little *too* fast paced; this may be by design but it would be nice to see accessibility settings  that allow you to slow down the game speed a little to suit the player's preference. 
- Visual effects sometimes make it difficult to see what's going on. It will be nice when settings are added to tone that down a bit. 
- Dodging in this game is often near impossible; your group of survivors has a huge hitbox that makes it nigh impossible to weave through a tight gap without taking a hit",1697510298,1697510298,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The lore, world and general vibe is goofy zombie stuff and doesn't take itself too seriously, but gory enough to feel like a good balance.

It follows a similar format to survivor-like games but probably the prettiest I have played(nearly been killed several times while admiring the lighting..).

Unlocks are ""use this character a bunch"", unlock skill points to get stronger, its all very basic. The gameplay itself is just plain old zombie killing fun. Blood, gore, bodies flying, shooting a minigun into a crowd and watching them turn into mist, its borderline psycho behavior and i love it.

Only cons are the performance on newer maps, some characters are terribly annoying to level up (medic mostly), and although i enjoy the simplicity i would like some form of synergy or transformation when certain conditions are met.

i think if you love grinding and general meta game progression upgrade loop, plus discovering all the upgrades/weapons and unlocks/perks and experimenting then this game defo maybe has around 20 hrs or so atm, ive kinda had it on in background so ignore my hrs lol, i have completed it but still having fun messing with builds. while initially limited by content compared ti other games of similar type, the devs seem to have been working extremely hard at delivering more! with a new map expansion, and now new modes and even more extras (in beta at time of review) its pretty, plays nice/smoothly and has a really nice challenge!

initially i judged harshly based on price v content, but im happier to recomend this game now at its current version/price theres a good amount of content overall to seek your teeth into. for a survival game like this, easily 20 to 30 hours of gameplay imo!
i did discover there's some fun physics like you can literally blow enemies sky high with rocket launcher or other explosive weapons... i guess if you really scratch under the surface and realise that this game seems to have 3d ish physics, a nice looking graphic style, smooth no hiccups frame rate, its pretty fun. 

this game is awesome and has tons of potential to grow, and not only that, the small dev team have proved themselves that they are working hard, and have been producing regular content updates so far!

i think overall this game is a little slow to start, im sure its possible to complete a wave without meta prog, but i admit i had to grind a few games before i could finally survive.
my advice at first would be to play each character to see what you prefer!

the devs seem to be working closely with the community as they produce updates which is pretty cool!
im excited for more content, and im hopeful this game will turn into a really fun packed title in the survivors genre!

based on what im seeing so far, the devs seems to be incredibly passionate about creating this game, and pushing updates/new content for the fans/players to enjoy!

well done devs!

if 20 to 30 hrs of replay ability and fun is on your radar, then i recommend this game wholeheartedly!
if however you like your rogue lites to be bursting at the seams, i think this is going to take time, but the devs are right on track, the game has wonderful vibes atm, at least for me personally. if you can justify the price to yourself, i definitely recommend supporting the devs, its a really fun game!",1689758455,1696562295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

That being said the game is pretty bare bones still as it is EA and has alot of room left to grow and build on.

The General idea of the game is there and can be enjoyable but as you get further along in the game you do find there is kinda Ideal  playstyles to compositions and item choices; more so for doing the harder content the game has for the moment.

The breakdown is more as such.

[b]Meta Progression-[/b] Pretty basic..nothing here thats gonna surprise you in the least. You get money during your playthru's and you spend them here for simple upgrades that make you characters feel more viable in their runs. Long term something deeper here would be nicer or maybe just add some class based upgrade choices. You could also make upgrades limited so you have say a finite number to pick so you have to choose more over just having everything unlocked and it not feeling very impactful.

[b]Gameplay-[/b] The game is pretty much your standard title for this area of things. The games are 20 mins long by default and the goal is simply just survive..no big baddie at the end or anything. At the start you only have 3 classes to pick from and you can unlock 3 more over time. During the gameplay you level up and pick skills separated between a gun tree or class based abilities.
On the map itself you'll have chests appear during the game that have items to add to your run that give various stats. You also have what they refer to as a SOS ( think like a chest for your character ). It allows you to select a 2nd and 3rd character to your team or forgo the addition to take a level up instead. Ultimately there is some strategy to waiting and sometimes you just want to choose the added character to your group. It does come with the trade off of having a larger Hitbox for your team for mobs to strike; So bare that in mind as you close unto the Character cap ( 3 ) on your run.

[b]Unlocks-[/b] There is unlocks for a few things. One is unlocking more characters in general; which require meeting certain goals ( things you'll do naturally playing anyways ). The other is unlocking the remainder of the characters abilities to play with on runs. The path to unlocking those is pretty straight forward..just kill mobs and they'll unlock naturally basically. The last thing is items you find in the treasure chests during runs. These are a bit weird in how their done..they are unlocked thru achievements in the game. So in a way you are basically required to complete in game goals to even get the item unlocks.

Personally the game is fun as it is but as stated the content is rather sparce at the moment; so depending how much time you plan to sink into it..you may breeze thru it pretty quickly.
A few issues i'd say with the time of writing this is simply the meta progression is kinda bland and needs more work.
Also the level up during the gameplay is kinda..idk..theres alot of options for only 20 mins of play and your never going to unlock everything on a normal run so you end up having to just cherry pick a perfered path and ignore skills to save points.
Lastly i'd say the items leave alot to be desired...
For example..you have one set of items thats simply tied to a achievement and does literally nothing else but stays in your loot pool for the rest of the game. Also alot of the choices are just bad and are basically gonna be auto skipped or banned every run regardless of your build. Ideally better choices need to be added in place of some that exist. Either lean in on the good ones and design more based around those..or add class based items that only pop up if you have that class in your team for that run or just something more..otherwise its kinda a small pool of usable items mixed with worthless ones kinda.",1696222946,1696223040,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is fantastic and has a great potential. 

Be warned though, since it is in early access the content is rather limited atm (6 survivors to level up, skill tree to finish and two playable maps atm). BUT the devs seem to be really nice and provide regular updates to the game. All in all, money well spend for me. :)

Steam deck review: These type of games are perfectly suited for steam deck (and its one of the main reasons I bought it): quick sessions (20 mins )and you can pause/sleep/continue anytime you want. Performance wise, well, erhm,  atm it is not optimised very well, once you pass like 10+min mark the game tends to drop below 25fps on default settings, changing some graphic settings improves the performance a bit but it is still far from being ideal.

For one, the way you upgrade your weapons, turning them into different upgraded versions. But especially, that you can play multiple archetypes and safe up to 3 survivors during a run, which makes you control a little squad of archetypes with different weapons and skills. This makes for very different runs.

Pros:
Its fun and has a good starting amount of options to play with.
Graphics are good.
Music fits.
awesome restart game play/ recover mode.
This i could see in a modern warfare zombies game.

Cons:
-Enemy's can seem to re-spawn outside of map.
-Leveling up seems slow to keep up with Damage and enemy numbers. Like money and exp. I know there is not a easy normal and hard mode.
-Map select can be confusing in a way if you don't pick game mode and select map it will start asap.
-desert map boss spawn too fast on endless mode.

My personal input:
-add a flamethrower person.
-a water map with a shark boss or hazard would be fun.
-creative mode to test out builds and set ups would be nice for the future.
-all boss mode or all zombies max spawn would be fun.
-random mode that auto levels your player would be nice.
-power up that does all the boost attk, def, and speed would be rare but nice.
-boss idea on a toxic zone map a mob that can steal a lv or perk. kill it to get it back. 

This game is new and fun i have nothing but respect and support. please keep up the good work. i see nothing but positives. P.S. it be cool if you added a ray gun for fun XD.

Once you reach the late stages, some options for OP builds become available, but unless you seek them out they do not force themselves upon you. The randomness of the available options for each level up is a problem, especially when opening item chests, as the pool of available options is too broad and the tools for managing it are too limited. 

Sounds are great, and even though the soundtrack is just one song on repeat, it's a solid background track. Booms and splats and zaps sound visceral and impactful, and the graphic impact of your explosions and heavy hits is satisfying. Graphics are solid but not exceptional, especially survivor animations (ghost, please stop wobbling as you run, you look like an idiot) and optimization at higher enemy density both need a lot of work still.

Hotfix includes zombie speed stat growth for endless mode which was huge issue. Now it is actually doable and possible to reach 30 minute mark in game. But at the moment that does not mean that all problems are solved, not even close. I would give this review mixed option because default characters are still not finished and they lack last upgrade that is shown in game with coming soon place holders.

Previous update:

It's 8th of September, 2023 - developers released new minor 0.3.2 patch. The patch contains sort of fix for endless mode zombie ultra speed. However i did not felt difference for some reason because i still can't get pass 25 minute mark no matter what characters i chose, also engineer's plasma shield becomes useless because zombies just run through it instead of stunning/holding them back. Characters still do not prioritize zombies which are in face and instead shoot boss zombies who are 5 meters away. BS. Therefore still not recommended.

Older update:

As of August 29th developers released first ""major"" 0.3 update. After testing out this new update i will say that review will remain negative for time being.

Barely anything new added. There is only 1 new map with couple new enemies for that specific map only and that is it. Not even new character or weapons or abilities, well at least something like that.
Even current characters are not finished, just keep that in mind. There supposed to be 4 levels (rank) for each character with their specific unlocks and yet only 3 levels are available. Waiting 1.5 months for update and you get 1 map with couple new enemies. What is this?

But what really pisses me of is current situation while playing survival aka endless mode. The way enemies scale after certain time is absurd. Once you reach (if you reach) 20 minute mark, then all zombies will run toward you with hyper speed. Player is unable to outrun zombies at all. 
Even worse there is this special Axe boss zombie who will shadow step player and hit while is running at you and that is it game lost. His single hit is 1k damage. It is no longer skill based but luck based only game now that is if your dodge chance activates. How is this normal?


Initial review:

Hear me out!

I like this game, however there is not enough content in its current state and for the price they are offering. Even Vampire survivors had more content during early access for less price.

There is not much you can do as entire game consists of ""Coming Soon"" place holders. 1 map that gets boring quite fast and total of 6 characters and 3 of them can be unlocked by doing certain task.

Very little abilities which cannot even been evolved into something stronger, i mean those abilities barely even scale during the gameplay aside from passive/permanent upgrades after game ends and that is basically it.

I might change this review when there will be much more content available.",1690097911,1694536570,False,137,1,0.722101926803588867,8,True,False,True

yes, ""but""

pro: 
- decent graphics, feels good. explosions and stuff have a nice splash. 
- graphed attacks so you can dodge
- some weapons / abilities are interesting or somewhat pleasing
- you can have 3 instead of the usual 1 guy to play as, making up small ""combos"" of abilities. 
- its just 10$ which is quite the selling point

con: 
- some abilities are absolutely useless xd. DPS isnt even in the same potency. same with the characters and their combinations. there isnt much to ""choose"" from as there are only a couple characters and their combinations are obvious. 
- even with maxed speed to outrun and enough damage to basicly oneshot those thin almost unseeable speeder zombies, you get run down by them at some point in endless mode. would prefer if you could scale forever if you PLAY WELL instead of getting the ""speed stat"" checked at a certain minute (mutation) mark. also bosses should be the biggest threat, not the little critters :P
- speaking of bosses. monster variety is poor. 2 ""mini"" bosses, one ranged single projectile spitter and 2 trashmobs (one is the speed, the other a generic zombie). 
- perma upgrades are simple stat checks as well (more damage, more speed, more gold, more exp, more crit, more crit damage etc. nothing special IMO). 
- only two maps so far, nothing much to do there either, its just background (no interactables etc.)
- you reach a point where you upgraded everything decently fast with nothing left to do but walk around and waitfor the speeders to reach you :D 
- not many abilities to choose from. the ones you can unlock take forever. IMO you should be able to unlock them for all 3 played not just the leader. 

conclusion: its very superficial but if it had more depth it would be very good. for 10$ its still recommendable short fun.",1694470908,1694470908,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Parts of my complaints could mean the game is just not made for me. Which is fine. So if the negative points sound positive to you, take this review as a recommendation. Keep in mind the game is early access and stuff will probably subject to change.

TLDR: Solid VS-like with nice visuals but with a slow incremental progression that could be an issue for certain players.

The Good:

- The 3D look with nice dynamic lighting effects and satisfying gore and ragdolls is a bit of a standout in the VS-like Genre. It definitely enhances the general gameplay experience.

- Setting: Zombies should be a nobrainer for a horde genre so this is just fitting perfectly. Mowing down hordes of Zombies is just satisfying.

- The game uses a squad system instead of a single player character. The player chooses one starting character and can add up to 2 more during a given play. Each squad member has unique abilities and a weapon that can be separately levelled from the others. This has a lot of potential for mixing and matching of different squad members to enhance their strength. You can add new members through saving survivors of the zombie apocalypse.
An especially good mechanic is how you add new squad members. Every minute or so you have the opportunity to save a survivor. Doing that gives you the choice of hiring a new member or save the survivor. The second option gives you money (for meta progression) and a player level. This creates the interesting dynamic in the early to mid game of deciding when to add a new member or level the existing ones. It also adds a source of steady linear improvement throughout the game. This is especially helpful in the late game, where the level progression is heavily slowed down by the semi exponential experience requirements. 

- The different squad members abilities and weapons are quite fun and diverse. Levelling those and choosing your squad members accordingly for synergy is really nice and has much potential. As far as I know this is also a unique mechanic in the VS-like Genre

- Supply drops and saving survivors always keeps you moving on the map. This is a mixed bag, because it also invalidates stationary play styles which rely on planting turrets and the like.

The not so good:

First I want to reitarete that this is early access and the game is subject to change, If the devs read this and think “yep everything works as intended” than that is completely fine and just means that this game is not for me. 

- Even though the squad system suggests player freedom and experimentation right now that is not the case. Some characters just don’t go well with another (which is fine) and there are essentially just two play styles. Those are reliance on weapons or the abilities. If you go the weapon route you take damage, crit, crit damage, reload speed and attack speed. There could be small adjustments made according to weapon speciality but it does not matter much. If you focus on abilities you take cool down reduction and ability damage, as well as squad members with more active abilities. While this is decision making, two options for an overall play style isn’t that much. In Endless this matters little, because you have to level everything anyway to keep up with the scaling.

- Metaprogression is boring. You can earn money in game to spend on permanent upgrades outside of it. These upgrades are absolutely genre standard eg health, attack speed, attack damage etc. The improvements are always small but that’s okay. They matter bought in bulk and are mainly for motivation its just uninspired and utilitarian, can be improved alot. I take more issue with the squad member metaprogression. Unlocking a new character gives them a weapon + one evolution and two abilities. You can unlock more weapon upgrades and abilities per character through unlocking tiers. These are unlocked by killing zombies with the specific characters as squad leader. That’s it. Just kill 20000 Zombies with this character and after that do it again and again and again. A successful standard run gives you about 9000 dead Zombies. I have no issues with the game asking me to unlock them it is just super boring and feels like grind. Why are the unlock conditions not something different per character that also corresponds to their theme? There is a lot of potential improvement to be made here.

-  There are two path of progression ingame. One is levelling you squad members (which is nice) the other one is looting supply drops that spawn every minute or so. These give you, in contrast to levelling, stat improvements for health, attack damage, etc. The improvements are quite small for example +10% weapon damage or -10% reload speed. Some of them can be felt more than others. They are essentially for progress they just don’t feel very exciting to get because of their inherent blandness.
If you unlock various achievements you also unlock new items that can be found in the supply caches. While this sounds like good meta progression it really isn’t. That’s because the new items are not only boring sometimes day are a straight up downgrades to existing items. Many of the new items are just two stats mixed instead of one e.g. instead of 10% weapon damage you now get 5% wd and 5% reload speed. Its essentially the same as before just now the stat improvement feel even more meaningless. Some are also just worse. For example a standard item gives you 15 armor, an unlockable item gives you 5% weapon damage (alright but lame) and 5! armor. I know its just a loss of 2,5 armor BUT it feels bad and other combination items have the 7,5 armor so it just doesn’t not make sense. Also there is standard item that heals 500 health. An unlocked one now gives you 50hp/s for 10 seconds (500hp) but you loose 100 max health.. that is just a straight up downgrade and the item is useless. 
All of these new items also muddy the pool of available items. Because many of them are at best the same as before but more boring (stat splitting) or straight up worse you wait much longer for the items you really need for your build and/or expend a much higher amount of banish and reroll as before. So this meta progression makes the player experience actively worse, because most items are not useful. 
This is not necessarily a flaw of the system (there are some good unlockable items which are not fully stats based) but of the execution and I think that can be greatly improved in early access.

- only two maps

- a loot system: having some sort of equipabble loot drops that drastically change the builds would be amazing. For example every boss enemy can drop something from a pool of items that range from simple stat boosts to drastic weapon changes. Basically a simplified ARPG system. Then make the items added to our collection and selectable before stage runs. 

- evolutions / interactions - some system that is defined by our selection of survivors that changes how weapons / defenses work

- main character priority - some kind of benefit / advantage depending on our choice

The auto-shooter/bullet heaven category’s absolutely littered with low-poly Vampire Survivors (VS) clones, and while Yet Another Zombie Survivors (YAZS) doesn't meaningfully innovate, it does have a comfortingly casual gameplay loop with a contemporary art direction.

Instead of curating a suite of complementary weapons and passives (as you do in VS), YAZS has you choose survivors to form a trio. Each survivor has an evolving weapon set, inbuilt passive stat buff, and a selection of abilities you can choose from that trigger when off cooldown. It’s a fun tweak to the VS formula, but doesn’t have the depth of VS’s approach, which is a little damning considering how limited the genre’s depth already is.

Part of what makes VS good is it’s about taking a concept and seeing how silly you can make the execution. Have a character that gains a stacking area increase to their abilities? What weapons would this power enhance to a busted level? What passives do I need for those weapons to get evolutions? What evolutions would pop off even harder? These thoughts flow easily into a build that ends up being world-shakingly ridiculous because VS is all about making the insane happen. As graphic effects chaotically fill your screen, blinding your ability to even see where you’re going, you realise that VS is a game that’s laughing at its own ridiculousness, and it’s all the better for it.

Comparatively YAZS offers a much more grounded approach. The combinations of survivors, abilities, and item power-ups never reach the kind of chaos that VS offers, because the stat side is much more constrained, and the more realistic setting keeps it centred in a way that VS never tries to be. YAZS’ item choices are fairly pedestrian, shying away from the kind of stat madness that VS goes for, and its character abilities don’t have the sheer insanity that permeates VS. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a certain pleasure in YAZS’ simplicity. You’re always kept moving in search of the next drop or powerup, and the quiet accumulation of weapon power and abilities against the rising zombie tide feels well-paced and pleasing.

VS is still the undisputed king of this genre, and I sincerely doubt YAZS has the depth or potential to improve enough to ever challenge VS, but I had a good time with it and I’m certain it’ll get more enjoyable as content is added. If you want something more ""realistic"" than the silliness of VS then YAZS is a good option.",1693870744,1693870744,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

In it current state (update 0.03) it feel...  meh... The way the author put the news out makes it sound like they have these epic sounding updates, but sadly this is far from reality. 

THIS GAME IS DRASTICALLY OVER PRICED - wait for a sale.  Nearly all games in the genera are $3-$5 bucks. This one is $10 and it its current state feel like it should be 3-4 dollars.

Nearly all the skills after your main weapon abilities do not feel fun to use and are boring and completely lack invocation. After playing for 5-10 hours you pretty much know what weapons to use, what skills to have and what team members to pick 100% of the time.  There is very little build diversity so you are basically forced to go with the same build every run. 

The ""new abilities"" that are added in the second tree (as of 0.03), feel like a bad joke as they feel like there is no reason why the DEV/DEVS would not just combine a lot of the secondary abilities into one skill, to give them greater impact. This design feels like a poor excuse for padding game time for new players, than something interesting or useful.  

I want to like the game and for the moment i will not give it a thumbs down, but my recommendation is ""DONT BUY NOW"" and wait for a sale, and watch the updates... maybe by version 5 this game wont be so boring. 

The amount of weapons that are currently in the game feel underwhelming, currently there are 2 maps which are basically the same things... UwU... I mean if they are going to put out these kind of trash maps heck just spam 10 more least there would be a different stuff to look at and break the boredom. 

The main reason why i will not give it a thumbs down entirely it explosives feel epic and have impact. Which is on archer and tank. Laser on Engineer and sniper on Swat feel good. Tanks Mini gun is good!

-The ""Engineer"" feels great in nearly all of his abilities.. so congrats on him. the emp/shock Grenades are kinda dumb - everyone has Grenades. so who cares.  Tazer is boring - tesla coil feels better than the Blaster or laser and always feel like a downgrade every time i upgrade to the next weapon. Skills - Electric turret is cool but boring, energy shield is BADASS, Electrocution feels stupid and is too slow. 

-""Swat"" feels decent over all, UZI is stupid needs a buff or a rework, sniper riffle feels fun, assault riffle is standard but feels good. other skills feel kinda meh with Helicopter strike and Turrets are just OK
 
-Tank- shotgun is boring, pump-action-shotgun is the same as shotgun only now you have two round burst - so who cares.  Mini-gun feels good, Rocket Launcher feels GREAT. Other skills - Saw blades are good, landmines are meh. Bombing strike is EPIC

- Ghost is interesting...
- Medic is slow and boring...
- Huntress is boring...

Ideas I think would be great to see: 

one time drop specialty items that pack a MUCH heavier punch but much more random on the drop. For example drop these specialty items on the ground as loot like the power ups we receive but allow us to pass on it for extra life, XP, or CASH. Or possibly an item that alters one of our existing items we have that might change the approach to building that survivor differently than last round!

""Yet Another Zombie Survivors"" brings a refreshing twist to the survival horror genre. Developed by dedicated indie creators, this game stands out with its unique blend of strategic gameplay and relentless zombie encounters.

Gameplay: ★★★★★
In a post-apocalyptic world, players must manage a group of survivors, making tough decisions about resource allocation and combat strategies. The game's real-time resource management system adds depth, as players balance survival needs with the risks of scavenging.

Graphics and Atmosphere: ★★★★★
While not groundbreaking, the graphics effectively capture the game's grim setting. Minor glitches and occasional frame rate drops slightly disrupt the experience but don't detract significantly.

Story and Progression: ★★★★
The narrative takes a backseat, focusing more on survival challenges. Character stories are somewhat shallow, and a richer narrative could have added more depth. The game's pacing, introducing new enemies and challenges, keeps the gameplay engaging.

Conclusion:
""Yet Another Zombie Survivors"" offers a unique spin on survival horror. With its innovative gameplay mechanics, strategic depth, and tense atmosphere, it's a notable choice for those seeking a fresh take on the zombie apocalypse genre.",1693384707,1693384707,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Speaking of mute, I put the music slider on 0% for the last 8 hours.

There's no fun weapon combination or fusions, there is little randomness to what you're offered, every character only has 2 abilities at base, and unlock 4 more once you've played with them for a couple of rounds.

The characters aren't very interesting, the bosses aren't interesting, the only 3 mechanics you have to worry about are a single ranged enemy, a charging boss, and poison puddles on occasion, that's it.

There's only a single level, and you can either play that level for 20 minutes, or infinitely, that's it.

You can save up some currency for some standard ""Abilities deal x%/y%/z% more damage"" type upgrade trees, which is just boring, feels terrible to save up for, and is just uninspired.

The game just needs...more...More randomness, better enemies, more maps, WAY more weapons/upgrades, weapon fusions, dropped powerups; just...a lot more needs to be done to justify the price right now, because Vampire Survivors and Holocure do this job IMMENSELY better for CHEAPER.

However, I want to throw some support to indie developers.  AAA games don't try new things or push limits.  Diablo 4, it's Diablo.  It's been the same game for 4 iterations.  It's still a bit of fun, but there's nothing new in it.

When I bought Yet Another Zombie Survivors, I was looking for some killy fun.  The kind of game you can pick up and put down for a short bit of stress relief.  I was half right.  I picked it up, then wound up playing 3.5hrs.  Luckily this was a weekend!

Upgrading a weapon and watching the front lines of a zombie horde melt, will bring a tear to your eye.
When you're surrounded and dying and you hear the sweet music of a helicopter obliterating a path through the zombies 
   for your escape, you will cheer.
You unlock a new weapon, you play the character and upgrade to the new unlock.  Rockets flare and blow great chunks out 
   of the horde.  

You will want more.  More carnage.  More destruction. More explosions, zombies, upgrades, buffs, boss zombies, BRING THEM ON you'll scream out in defiance!  You'll glare at your screen and choose a leader and cackle.  Then you'll notice the time and wish you had more of that too.

If you enjoy the genre, you'll enjoy the game.  There are choices to make along the way.  Do I continue with a single character and max them out?  Do I get 2 other characters to join ASAP?  That means you'll level abilities slower, more choices means lower odds of being displayed when you level up.

Each character that joins your squad has a passive buff and their own abilities.  Which mesh best with your current squad?

If you lust for undead carnage, if you want some mindless (hah!) violence, pick this up.  Or at least add it to your wishlist and wait for the additional content.  I'm having a blast (also hah!).

My main problem with the game at the moment is that there isn't much room for choices, each character has their gun you can upgrade, evolve into a more powerful version, and then choose between two even more powerful versions, and also two abilities, which when you put them at max level there's nothing left to upgrade for that character. The only time I find myself making a choice is between the two different gun transformations, nothing else, because each time I level up I just upgrade something without thinking much. My suggestion would be to not only make a lot more characters, which I suppose they're already gonna do obviously, but also make them have more depth to them, make me consider each of my options when upgrading stuff, maybe create more skills for all characters but have them capped at two for each one so you don't have 50 abilities poppin' every few seconds which would make the game a cakewalk, and would force you to actually choose between different skills and test different combinations of skills with each character and in different squad combinations. And also other than that, of course the game needs more content in general.
Anyways I think this game has a lot of potential, looking forward to the new updates, keep up the good work!

Im a sucker for bullet hell. roguelike/lites and overall the survivors genre type of games so this is right up my alley,
So the overall Feeling and fluidity of the game is great the movement isnt that stiff and feels great.
The visuals are also great (even though my pc froze up and had to hard restart) but that might have been my gpu acting up have to do more research on that while playing.
Now there isnt that much content as in there are only 2 or so skills for each character if you dont count their weapon but im not counting that necessarily as a negative because the game is only a few months old,

The 3-team squad thing is pretty cool but it's just a way to lock in your weapon and special ability choices. Ultimately, if you've played a lot of horde survival games, the gameplay loop will be pretty familiar.

After around 5 hours (including time with the demo), I felt like I'd seen most of what the game offers. I could play for longer and grind out the meta progression, but there's not much else to do yet. So personally I think that it's worth the $10 asking price, considering other finished games in the same genre go for half that and have a lot more content (eg. Time Wasters). I also wonder if they're scaring off fans of the genre with the higher cost.

That said, I've enjoyed my time with it overall, and I've played and LOVED another game by this dev ([url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/465200/Fury_Unleashed/]Fury Unleashed[/url]), which is bursting with creativity. So I believe in the developers, and I'm sure what's on offer so far is just a taste of things to come.

However......basis of the game was Vampire Survivors, and not Soulstone Survivors, so you are VERY limited on builds variety.

- UI lacks information 
- Your own skills lack information
- You cant check your skills and weapons beyond in-game selection leveling up
- Balancing issues - some upgrades are worse than previous guns, some skills are almost pointless
- Good performance - lags FPS (as all massive bullet hells do), but doesnt cook my GPU while standing in an open room

And the only mentionable other one ... can't recall but you were playing a Mech and that felt kind of .. anonymous, and lackluster implementation.

Not so Yet Another ... funny that it had to be ""another"" one that seems to get it right. :)

I like how the mobs are animated characters with ragdolls so it feels satisfying slicing through them. It gives you that sense of accomplishment and power and satisfaction I like in a shooter. 

I like how the items stand out, how I can always see my character(s) and differentiate between them, the mobs, and the mayhem of particles and projectiles. 

I like the fact that you can combine up to three characters - or just go solo for a different challenge. I like the speed and agility you can play this game as well as the diversity you get from going with different characters and upgrade paths. 

I like how you feel more powerful over time and the difficulty curve seems well balanced - and once you think you can't ever not complete a run is where you should try endless or hardcore mode to put your current level of abilities into perspective.

I also like to have played through the entire game as is, with almost all achievements and all training perks done - and I can still look forward to three more characters, a third upgrade level for each character, and new ""maps"".

Yes, it's EA.  Yes, it needs a lot more content, but the overall gameplay is solid.  I didn't really encounter any bugs at all playing the game.  I feel like once the additional content gets released, this will be a super fun game to play through the rest of the content.

You basically have two types of damage - weapon and skill dmg.  I feel like this needs some tuning, as the skill damage tends to be FAR less than weapon damage.  In these types of games, you typically move constantly, and some of the skills place a turret or something on the ground, and they tend to do very little damage as you move offscreen from them as compared to other skills.

Awesome Game Studios did a great job of differentiating YAZS from its brethren by adding key features:

1. You are not solo. Instead, you get to ""rescue"" up to two other survivors to add their weapons and abilities to your attempt.
2. These other survivors come with their own abilities that are unlocked with play as with any roguelike. They are different enough from the other classes - medic, tank, SWAT, ghost, huntress, and engineer - to make each play thru a challenge, 
3. The abilities that are unlocked separate from the classes are adjustable before each run, making the combo of party, weapon tree choice, and abilities extremely customizable.
4. The graphics are quite good for a RBH game.

You unlock stuff per class when it's your primary pick but you still gain bonuses from up to 2 other survivors so you can really mix and match what you build into. Plus you are able to add and subtract meta points you earn for future runs to try different builds even more. Like some perks in the meta menu for future runs effect reload speeds or shooting speeds, while others effect cooldowns similar. There is also a wide variety. If you're on the fence take a gander on YouTube and you'll understand what makes this a gem thus far.

Some things to keep in mind.
- Having to stop and wait to pick up survivors or upgrade caches. It annoyed me to no end but now I see it as an added challenge to do while being swarmed. I still think it needs to drop in time every so slightly though because it still feels a little TOO long.
- Not being able to direct your groups firing direction. This makes it extremely hard to clear lanes to escape through or to open up to get items. I prefer to direct my groups/characters attacks otherwise it is just one of those useless idle games but I decided to think of it as a challenge mechanic where if you want to clear a lane you get close to the zombies you want to clear since proximity takes priority unless a boss is around.
- The priority targeting. Your group targets Bosses above all else even if it is not the closest enemy which gets your group hit more times than not. Should've either allowed us to pick our priority targets or defaulted to closest enemy since we cannot control our groups firing direction. This is a flaw in the game that needs work IMO.
- Weapons missing target. I did not like it at first but grew to accept it. I could do without it TBH though.

BUGS:
- Bosses appearing with no health bar so have to guess.
- The bosses that charge not orienting correctly and facing opposite direction and so does their charge arrows even though they ultimately end up charging you like normal.
- Boss bar staying just below my characters even after it had died for the entire play through.
- Enemies appearing outside of map that can fire at you but you can't fire at them.
- Skills like mines appearing outside map so do absolutely no good.
- Had level up screen not freeze game like it should and got hit while my skill choice screen was up.",1689855887,1690739684,True,0,0,0.470430105924606323,0,True,False,True

My thoughts:

I am giving this a good review because the game has potential and I don't want to screw the dev with a bad review, considering this game in in early alfa. This might change if the price and content stays the same on the 1.0 version. If you don't want to support the development of this game don't buy it. It is not worth the price in its current state. Brotato for example is half of the price and it is a much more complete and fun game. Project Lazarus is prety much the same game with robots and aliens instead of zombies, and it is also cheaper and more complete, just giving too examples to prove the point.

About the game:

The game is another vampire survivors clone, brings absolutely nothing new to the table, that being said it is a good bullet hell game, the problem is that it really lacks content. There is only one map, 6 characters, each with 3 skills and 4 diffent weapons, enemy variety is 4 types of standard zombies and 3 types of elites and that is all. Considering that it takes between 10-45 minutes to complete, depending of the mode you choose, It does get repetitive very, very fast.

The only ""special"" thing this game does is that you can complete the session with up to 3 characters, but in reality they work as one entity so all you are doing is selecting the skills you want to use. Everything else is as standard as it gets.

Conclusion:

There is not much else to say. Bullet hells are simple ""toilet"" games, this one is no different, just another vampire survivors clone with 3D graphics and a zombie theme. Nothing more, nothing less. The problem is that it is a little bit expensive for the game it is.",1690435795,1690435795,True,9,1,0.625159919261932373,0,True,False,True

One of the coolest things about YAZS is the achievement system. It's well-designed,so far and going after those achievements added a whole new layer of fun to the game. I've spent hours exploring every corner of the game stage, trying to unlock every achievement, and it's been super satisfying.

The gameplay in YAZS is smooth as butter, and I found myself completely engrossed in the game world. The graphics are top-notch, and the gameplay kept me hooked from start to finish. You can tell the developers poured their hearts into creating this masterpiece.

What's even more exciting is the promise of more content on the horizon. I can't wait to see what else they have in store for YAZS. The potential for this game is through the roof, and I'm eagerly looking forward to new challenges and adventures.

Major props to the developers for their hard work and dedication. It's clear that they genuinely care about their players and delivering an incredible gaming experience. With such a strong foundation, I have no doubt that YAZS will only get better and better.

6 classes at the moment, including a tank and healer. I find it fun to mix these up and see what works well.

There are six characters available (3 as standard and 3 you unlock) and only 1 map, with 3 game modes; Normal, Hardcore, and Endless. However, there are placeholder slots in the game for 'coming soon' content showing the potential for a lot more characters and maps. The Devs are also vocal on their discord, and they have taken in some of the feedback I have given and implemented it in the game, which is nice to see.

So what about the actual game? Honestly, it's amazingly fun. If you like the genre of a 'Bullet Heaven' style Roguelite, such as Vampire Survivors or Brotato, then you will probably like this too. The graphics are better, and it runs really well on the Steam Deck too (despite the current rating of unknown). FPS does drop on the Steam Deck, but if you turn the FPS counter off, it is hard to tell the FPS is dropping, for the most part and the Devs are working to make it run more optimised on the Deck.

I am excited to see and test out new content in the game when it releases, and there is a decent level of replay value available in the game.

Notes for devs: (I know this is early in development, and the game is really fun)
1. Class balance
-- Engineer > everything else.
-- Is the Swat helicopter meant to do anything? it only appears to obfuscate the ground effects, with minimal damage
-- Medic makes the group significantly better in every situation
2. Weapons are fun, but it seems like the tiers aren't balanced against each other.
-- The tier 2 Engineer weapon is better than the upgrades, as the laser doesn't seem to hit enemies behind the target.
-- Swat sniper needs a buff
-- Bow's multishot upgrade feels awful since the arrows reset when you select ice/explosive, even the medic's syringe is more fun
3. Upgrades / Traits
-- Increasing damage by upgrading crit always seems to be the best choice since the +abilities and +attacks don't do enough. If you want people to choose between weapon damage vs abilities, the upgrades need to do more
-- Health upgrades are too low, and taking Medic fixes most issues
4. Add a minimap, please!
5. Why are the buffs fading so quickly?
6. New classes (random thoughts)
-- Trapper (cc, slows)
-- Brute (big hammer-type)
-- Assassin/poison-type?

It was pretty obvious that they realized maxxing out zombie damage at 300% was not the right call otherwise players would survive forever.  Unfortunately, this completely destroyed the willingness to play past 25 mins.  In addition to removing the damage cap, they sped up the zombies to the point where you can't possibly outrun the axe murderer guy because he swings the second he stops running.

I guess how else would you eventually kill us, considering we can level up heal per second past 30 and lifesteal at 5%. That, in combination with the engineer bubble is an unkillable combo.  However, at that point, you make the zombies so fast and so strong that at the 25-30 minute mark, we can't level at the same speed as them.

Basically up to 15 mins you're dominant and you can easily avoid any damage using the engineer bubble, tesla and any offensive duo.  At some point at 20 mins, you stop becoming powerful and the zombies start to level at a ridiculous rate.  Unless devs allow me to upgrade alongside the zombies allowing me to continue to be stronger, I'll never make any progress.

The genre is typified by spending most of your time just moving around the map, collecting stuff and trying not to get hit (re. bullet-hell, sorta).  If you're unfamiliar with it, it can sound boring - and for some of the games available, it is.  However, the best in the genre blend strategy with tension and several upgrade trees (re. rogue-lite) to yield something that keeps you coming back for more.  YEZS has done this, as well as improved the entertainment factor.

Here, you play one of several unlockable classes, and during a map, you can rescue (so far) up to two more of the available classes to give yourself a 3-person squad.  That squad spends its time gathering upgrades (good only for that gaming session), as well as money which can be used to permanently improve your squad's stats (good for every game you play).

I'm not sure why I'm not burnt out on the zombie idiom yet, but here it's fun, and adds to this game's ability to stand out from the pack (IMHO).  There are loads of different kinds of zombies: shamblers, poison spewers / poolers, sprinters, wasp sprayers, and several kinds of elites.  The graphics here are better than average for the genre too, and include rag-doll physics for the models, which is a nice touch.

Most of the survivors games I've played end up filling up the screen with mobs; this can make the game more tense, which is obviously a good thing.  I haven't seen that with YAZS yet - but instead it shrinks your of field of view.  With stuff sprinting at you from off-screen, this definitely creates a very familiar ""zombie tension"" - and in my experience is relatively new to the genre.  It works well with the other game features.

In short, this game is keeping me engaged more than almost all of the rest of the Survivors games I've played, and gets a solid recommendation from me.",1690303348,1690303348,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

เกมโคตร Overrated สำหรับตอนนี้นะ

ซื้อวันนี้ราคา 170 บาท

16.9 ชั่วโมง นับรวมเวลาที่เปิดเกมทิ้งไว้แล้วนั่งเล่น Rov ทุกคืน

เกมจริงเล่นไม่ถึง 10 ชั่วโมง ปลดล็อกความสำเร็จ 100%

เกมเล่นโคตรง่าย คอนเท้นโคตรน้อย ยังอยู่ระหว่าง Early Access เพิ่งเวอร์ชั่น 0.2.2 แนะนำให้รอมันอัพเดทเยอะๆค่อยซื้อราคาเต็มก็ได้ จะได้ไม่สะดุดเวลารออัพเดทแบบ Vampire Survivors

ระบบเกมคล้ายๆ Vampire Survivors ถ้ามี Vampire Survivors อยู่แล้วจะลองซื้อมาเล่นก็ได้ เกมสนุกดี แต่ถ้ายังไม่มี กำตังไปซื้อ Vampire Survivors + Dlc คุ้มกว่า เอาจริงๆต่อให้ซื้อตั้งแต่วันที่เกมออกสัปดาห์แรกเหมือนกัน Vampire Survivors ก็ยังคุ้มกว่าอยู่ดี

และที่ต่างกันคือระบบการพัฒนาตัวละครที่ส่วนตัวชอบเกมนี้มากกว่า ทั้งการเลือกตัวละคร เลือกอัพสกิล ทำมาเข้าใจง่ายกว่าค่อนข้างเยอะ และมือใหม่เข้าถึงค่อนข้างง่าย และตัวเกมโดยรวมเล่นง่ายมาก เล่นมาทั้งเกมยากสุดคือการเอา Medic ไปปลดสกิลนี่แหละ ยังดีกว่ามันเพิ่งบัฟมาในเวอร์ชั่นล่าสุด ใครเพิ่งซื้อมาเล่นก็โชคดีไป

เกมนี้อภิมหาบัคกระจุยกระจาย เจอตั้งแต่มอนทะลุแมพ บอสเกิดทับตัวละคร ของดรอปแต่เก็บไม่ได้ เปิดซัพพลายไม่ได้ หนักสุดที่เจอคือ บอสตัวใหญ่ไม่มีหลอดเลือด วิ่งไล่ตั้งแต่ 10 นาที ยันจบรัน และตั้งแต่เวอร์ชั่น 0.2.1 ตัวเกมมีอาการ stuttering แบบงงๆหาสาเหตุไม่ได้ แล้วเฟรมเรทตกแบบงงๆสองสามวิหาสาเหตุไม่ได้เช่นกัน 

และการปรับสมดุลที่แปลกๆของเกม ตั้งแต่เล่นวันแรกจนถึงวันนี้ไอ Ghost คือตัวที่จะเล่นโหมดไหนก็วิ่งคนเดียวได้แบบสบายๆโดยที่ไม่ต้องพึ่งพาตัวละครอื่นๆ วิ่งในที่นี้คือวิ่งจริงๆนะ ตีบอสตายแต่ตายช้า แต่วิ่งได้จนจบรันไม่โดนซอมบี้ตี หรือ โดนตีวิ่งต่อแป๊บเดียวเลือดเต็ม ไอตัวนี้ตีซอมบี้ 1-2 ทีตายและวงตีกว้างมาก 

เล่นตัวอะไรก็ได้แล้วเอา ghost + Huntress ประดับทีม = easy mode

ในขณะที่ Medic คือตัวบัฟเด้งเลือดที่แทบจะไม่มีประโยชน์อะไรเลยถ้าเล่นไอสองตัวบนแล้วตีมอนทีเดียวตายหมด 

บอสเกมนี้ถ้าไม่วิ่งแบบหลับตา หรือ ไม่ใส่ใจ หรือ วิ่งไปเล่นมือถือไป หรือ ตีลังกาไปวิ่งไป นอกจากป้าที่ปล่อยแมลงตัวเดียวที่เหลือโอกาสโดนตีคือ 1% ส่วนใหญ่จะไปโดนลูกกระจ๊อกดักหน้าล้อมหลังตายมากกว่า

In short: I'm done with devs selling games with the promise of being good someday.

1) Like others said, it's extremly lacking in content. Only one map and of the nine survivors three are ""coming soon"". Oh, and the last level of the existing ones is also ""coming soon"". What [b]IS[/b] there got boring veeeeery fast. (There are enough games of this type out there with way more content for a lower price)
2) Performance is horrible. It struggles to stay over 100 fps at 1440p, while the utilization of the CPU always stays between 10 and 20% and GPU [b]never[/b] even reaches 50%. It's way worse on Steam Deck (but i dont consider that for my recommendation, since the game is not marketed for it). Barely over 20 fps later in the 20 minutes round while utilization of CPU and GPU always stays around 35%.
3) Balancing is horrible, too. That's not that big of a deal because it can be fixed easily with feedback of the players. Makes this point the only one i would consider a good point [b]for[/b] the early access release.

After all this game gives me the feeling the devs just put some bought assets from the Unity-Store together to make some quick money. Make a handfull of half-hearted updates in the future and abandon it. [b]Most likely that is not the case (it's not a new studio and they have already published some games)[/b], but that happend so often with early acces games here on Steam that i can't ignore that feeling.

Gameplay is satisfying and addictive, but the level of content is extremely lacking. 
One game mode, one map and a few characters. 

I know it's early access so this is to be somewhat expected, but I would have liked to see the content fleshed out more before release rather then a minimum viable product. After completing the first level (surviving for 20 min) there's not much else to do.

Most of the additional weapons are shit - everything other than main weapons and buffs are typically not worth leveling. Classes are unbalanced and mostly boring, uninspired, and they just don't have that 'something' that makes you like them. The survival mode ramps up the enemy speed to a point where they just blink on the screen and you're one shot. There are 4 types of basic enemies - slow zombies, fast zombies, zombies that explode when killed and spitters + 3 elite monsters - one that charges at you, one that chargges at you but with axe and one that does not charge at you, which is fine as far as vampire survivors clone go.

UX is really bad - you have no idea what weapons do unless you test them yourself, there are no tooltips and no info on (for example) that medic's 2nd tier weapon poisons the enemies and if they die under the influence of the poison they explone and infect other around (its super weak tho, dont get excited)

Worst of all - no content. If you believe what you see on the menu's theres like 5% content available right now. But there's literally nothing - a single level where you just keep unlocking stuff that for the most part makes your character weaker - like the final kunai weapon for ghost just makes it harder to level up the thousand cuts. No real bosses, no 'hidden' content like in Vamp survivors, nothing.

Lastly since there are a lot of people who dont care about this - graphics are really bad. Not just the quality of the models - they are fine i guess - but the lighting setup, post processing etc. - it's just really BAD.

If you liked Vampire Survivors, or if you liked Brotato, You'll probably enjoy the hell out of Yet Another Zombie Survivors. 

The graphics are great, sounds are great as well. For being an early access game, I'm seriously hooked already, and have only run across some minor UI glitches. (Nothing game breaking)  In the hand full of days that I've had this game, it's already been updated by the developers, signaling to me that this game is well loved, and supported by it's dev team. 

Game play wise, there's only one map, but slots in the UI for more.  But even with that, I'm not bored with the game, and am thoroughly hooked in the game play loop.  Just today, I discovered that you could actually survive to see dawn, and complete a run without having to die.   Yes, I know, it's probably written somewhere that this is a goal, but I'm the type of person who dives in head first, and plays to discover the rules of the game as I go. 

So far, I've gotten 5 of the characters unlocked, and have only been focusing advancing the first character as a team leader.  I still have several team members to unlock, and there are more slots for future additions. 

As of yet, there are no visible monetization hooks in the game, and hopefully the game will remain this way.

If it looks good to you, don't bother with any other reviews and just buy it. And if you hate it, blame me for telling you to buy it and then get a refund. If you're looking for manual aim, keep waiting and I'll update once it's out.

Update time:
Version 0.2.2 fixed a lot of bugs and directly addressed issues that the community has brought up INCLUDING AUTO AIM.

So obviously I'm gonna talk about auto aim. 
Previously, the auto aim was so incredibly bad that I advised ignoring the game unless you're a hardcore ""survivors"" nerd. 
It's not fully fixed, there's still some wonky behavior with spread attacks like the Huntress' bow and the Tanks shotgun*, but it's good enough that I don't feel like certain characters are actually a handicap.

But look, at this point I'm just nitpicking. While not perfect, the auto aim is good enough that it no longer drags this game out of recommendation status and the developers quick response in solving these issues is a very good sign.

Still no manual aim though, devs say next update will have it so I'll update my review AGAIN once it's added. Maybe I should become a game journalist... I mean.... I can't be as bad as Polygon playing Doom or that one guy playing Cuphead...

NEW RECOMMENDATIONS! 
If you're looking for a lot of content or manual aim, keep waiting.
Everyone else, buy the game. It's pretty good.

* It kinda aims at the closest enemy, but then over a certain distance it seems to ignore the closest enemy and go for the attack that will hit the most enemies. Which sounds cool, but when you have explosive arrows it makes it harder to aim inside of a group of zombies instead of just at the ones in the front.
Also the character snaps between targets like the aimbot got turned 11 (which is probably exactly what happened).

---

tl;dr - Lots of potential, but poor quality auto aim really ruins the feel of the characters. I don't recommend the game to the casual player, but if you're a hardcore nerd for these ""Vampire Survivor""-like games then it's cheap enough that you won't feel ripped off by what it has right now.

Pros:
- Diverse characters
- 3 man squads are novel and a cool way to add variety to a run
- Continuously spawning equipment makes runs more varied while also giving you a reason to run around
- Continuously spawning survivors is a really cool way to get levels as the exp needs increase
- Boss characters have different mechanics
- Endless & Hardcore modes
- Characters can ""level up"" and unlock better weapons and new skills permanently.

Cons:
- Sound design on the weapons is hit or miss. The minigun sounds great, but the sniper sounds terrible. etc...
- Permanent upgrades don't feel impactful.
- FREAKING AUTO AIM SUCKS (I'll go into more detail on this one later)
- General lack of content (it's early access so I personally don't count this one, but it's still true)

Bugs I've seen:
- Sometimes a boss will spawn without a health bar and you kill it and it's health bar will appear just somewhere on the map and never leave that spot.
- Charger boss has a line indicating where it will charge, that line is worthless because the boss will immediately change direction to charge at you once it starts the charge. Even if it would be physically impossible for it to do so.
- Swarm boss scream is often out of sync and will sometimes just go off well after the boss has died.

Overall, it's a fun game with a DESPERATE need for an auto aim toggle. I'm going to rant about auto aim now.
Certain characters (huntress especially) are just absolutely nerfed by how horrendous the auto aim is. 
There's nothing quite as upsetting as maxing out your bow so it fires 4 explosive arrows at a time and then having the auto aim completely whiff 90% of the shots it takes because it doesn't understand the concept of leading your shots. You essentially have to stop moving to allow the character to shoot if you want to be sure you'll hit, and even then the auto aim accuracy only increases to about 80%. 
It's bad. It's so bad that it makes certain characters feel bad to use.
If you couple that with the very low impact that the permanent upgrades have on each run the game gets very boring very quickly.

I have 2 recommendations:
1. If you're a casual player that saw a new game and came here. Don't buy it. It's not worth your time and money as it is currently. Come check again in like 2 months, if the issues have been fixed by then my review will be updated.
2. If you're a hardcore ""Vampire Survivors"" nerd looking for your next fix, check out ""Halls of Torment"" and ""Soulstone Survivors"" first and then come back and get this game.",1689617593,1689898717,True,0,0,0.692221462726593018,9,True,False,True

Another good addition to the survivor genre. Y.A.Z.S is a V-Survivor-esque auto-shooter in the form of S.W.A.T vs zombie and it works really well. This game has the typical grind-set in mind with an extensive skill tree to upgrade and multiple characters to unlock. The graphics are nice. I played on PC and on Deck, and although good on both the frame rate suffered a bit on Deck at this point in time averaging 25fps. You control a squad of 3 soldiers, all having unique weapons and skills. This works well in single player but I REALLY wish a coop was incorporated. 3 player coop would make this game fantastic and I instantly thought this during my first run.

All of that was good fun. While obviously repetitive (currently just one map with a limited variety of enemies) it never got boring. I am no pro gamer, and did not grind particularly hard - but I think everybody will get at least 20 hours of play out of the game as is. 

I encountered no serious bugs, about the worst was the game not re-pausing when getting another reward while in a reward choice screen. There are a few minor visual glitches now and then (rubber-stretched entities), but too infrequent to disrupt play. The 40 Steam achievements were all good skill tests well in line with game play - except for ""It's raining men"". That one currently is dumb, because it does not work if you are levelled up (you do too much damage). However, even there the game has a saving grace: you can actually downgrade, do the achievement, and upgrade again at no cost.

Balance is already surprisingly good, with none of the leaders being much worse or a lot better than the others, in spite of significantly different abilities. For example, I have solo'ed default mode with all six currently available leaders (yes, even with the Medic... though that's more a test of kiting ability). 

Hardcore mode is significantly more challenging to complete than default mode, even though one only needs to survive 10 minutes rather than 20, and endless mode will kill you eventually (or at least I have not managed to create an ""endless"" team where I stop out of boredom rather than because of dying).

By virtue of what is visible already in game, we should expect the following new things to come in the game in future: three new leaders (not yet named), rank three for all leaders, and four additional maps of which one is already names (""Green Hell"", presumably a jungle map). 

All in all, I would definitely recommend picking this up, certainly at the current discounted price. It's a good entry into the genre and already in good technical shape in spite of being early access.",1689861042,1689861042,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I cant wait to see where they take it. Needs a lot of tuning and the medic needs reworked or what I would prefer just completely replaced as the archetype doesn't really make sense for the game but the other playable characters are quite fun. Crit needs major reworking for sure as Swat+Ghost+Huntress with super high crit and crit damage just steamrolls any other possible comp because the auto attack weapons are around 1k dps each and any ability based build cant even come close to that (a swat + engineer + huntress turret build with really good cdr is not half bad though)  A few of the weapon upgrades are straight up nerfs to the previous versions (for example the multishot 2nd tier bow being better than the exploding/frost version) but that is all stuff I am sure they will sort out with time. 10/10 fun affordable game I hope Asmon gives it a shot and it blows up like Halls of Torment did!,1689831041,1689831041,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

เป็นเกมอนาคตไกลที่ยังมีแผนอัพเดทตามมาอีกเป็นกระบุง ซึ่งบอกตรงๆว่าแค่ ณ ตอนนี้ก็จัดว่าเล่นได้เกินคุ้มราคาเกมแล้ว

จุดเด่นคือการฟอร์มทีมบิลด์ตัวละคร อาวุธ สกิล ซึ่งยิ่งมีมาเยอะจจะยิ่งเล่นได้หลากหลาย 

ถ้าเทียบเกมรุ่นพี่แนวเดียวกันที่มักจะใช้มุกจับคู่ไอเทม เกมนี้จะใช้การอัพเกรดของที่มีอยู่ไปเรื่อยๆ ซึ่งเราต้องรู้ว่าอัพเกรดมาจะเหมาะกับสถานการณ์มั้ย เพราะแทบทุกตัวละครจะเคลียร์ม็อบดีที่ขั้น2 แต่ขึ้นขั้น 3 จะเป็นการแบ่งสายเฉพาะตัวทำให้จากตัวเคลียร์ม็อบกลายเป็นตัวเน้นแดมเมจหรือตัวหยุดมอน อันนี้ก็เป็นสิ่งที่ต้องศึกษารายอันไป ที่หลายๆคนบอกอาวุธดาวน์เกรดนั่นแหละ ไม่ใช่ว่าเกรดสูงกว่าจะต้องดีกว่าเดิมในทุกเรื่อง

The only thing I could comment on is that all your items are pre-chosen, so it isn't like some other titles where you can get a large mix of items on every run and sometimes combine them into better things via upgrades/unlocks. Essentially each survivor has a weapon and 2 skills, so picking your team is everything. After that it's only buffs you will get opening crates.

I hope the content is added at a fast rate, will keep checking back in from time to time.

YAZS is very close to taking the crown away from Vampire Survivors on my top 5 list of bullet hell games.

Nevermind, I lied. It's already at the top of the list from the amount of fun I had with it thus far. The setting, look, and overall feel of the game has so much potential and we've only seen a fraction of what the game has to offer in terms of content. Each class and team/skill combination leaves a sense of curiosity as to how much havoc and rampage I can cause in a variety of ways with no sense of boredom whatsoever. Ghost+Huntress+Engineer with Thousand Cuts->Crit Chance->Blaster->ES? Can't touch me. SWAT+Engineer+Tank with AR->Launcher->Blaster->Mines/Chopper/Sentry? Don't even think about getting close. Don't forget about Happiness +10. Always take Happiness10.

It's too early for this game, the content is scarce, the upgrades most of the time don't feel impactful (read a review that said meta-progress is impactful in this game and thought wow nice) when in the end, it isn't at all, I did 15 min in my first run and after dying and spending some meta points the second one lasted 5 min because I took another less powerful main character.

The squad picking is cool but having only 3 characters to start (4 if you count the one you unlock fast) there really aren't much skills to see and much difference between your runs, at the 3 hour mark I've almost seen all the game has to offer at the moment. 

The game also features just one map at the moment, like man couldn't devs have waited a bit more and release the game with at least 2 or 3 different zones? The first one gets stale pretty fast in my opinion.

Then there's the aiming, oh god the aiming is damn horrible, you will lose countless runs because your characters feel like kids who have never shot a gun, you miss tons of shots while moving and to really get all your bullets to hit you need to stop (good luck with this in a zombie game).

The enemy variety is not bad but you get hit really easy and the feedback for it is not good at all most of the time.

I just think this game needed some more months in the oven before releasing. I'll check it out in some months and change my review accordingly but at the moment I don't think it's worth your time if you're not a Survivor-like diehard fan.",1689679247,1689679247,False,1,0,0.494999974966049194,0,True,False,True

So far comparing the three, this game's pace is slower. The skill progression is slower for this game. Needing to kill 5k, 15k and 25k to access the other skill is kinda okay as long as monster density is at par. Ive played a lot for 3 hours and in average you get to kill 5k mobs at 15 minutes. so to unlock ur character's skill u need to rerun the mission 5 times to access all of them Comparing to Vampire Survivors and Halls of Torment, u get to run once and twice to get all the bells and whistles associated to ur character. Also the items. there are a lot, like A LOT. and it feels that it doesnt help in the characters progression. The skills arent balanced for all characters. Medic is the most gimped of the three, then ghost and then hunter. It was more efficient to run Swat, Tank and Engineer at rank 2 as their skills synergize. I got burnt today trying to max rank my swat and i thought id get a better skill or a new weapon. The turrent doesnt have enough power to warrant to level. I dont think i would rank up the rest of the characters if thats what i get killing 25k mobs.  Same as the Training skills. Magnet at max doesnt absorb a lot of area. Xp at max doesnt feel it increases per level u buy. Also, whats with the invulnerable skill. i tried endless horde but when it got to lvl 18, i get hit by the boss ALL the time. the invulerable skill doesnt seem to work and it requires a lot of skill points which is a but tedious to get since the amount increases as the level increase. Why dont we just use the cash we collect from the mission.

All in all, its not a bad game. the pacing of the game is a slow. its fun at the start but the grind can burn you out. A lot of things need to be addressed to be at par with the other games of the same genre. Even brotato is more fun than this.

This forces you to use its auto-aim feature, and it's terrible. I am not going to waste hours into this game only to survive because the AI does not pick the right targets, and honestly, it seems very random as to what it chooses.

I was using the shotgun guy, which has a good spread on the shots, but the AI would constantly look to shoot the zombies solo instead of the massive pack, not utilizing its kit much better. It felt frustrating and counter-intuitive, making the game play less enjoyable.

When I joined the Discord to see how I could disable this feature, I was disappointed to find an FAQ section from the developer stating that the auto-aim is by design and that it's a ""better"" way to play the game. Furthermore, they mentioned that they will not be adding the option to aim yourself.

This decision feels like a significant oversight and a missed opportunity. Giving players the freedom to aim would have made the gameplay more engaging and allowed for more strategic choices. Unfortunately, this lack of control ultimately led me to uninstall the game and request a refund.

It's a shame because the game had potential. The visuals are appealing, and the concept is intriguing. However, the frustrating auto-aim mechanics make it difficult to fully enjoy the experience.

From the moment you step into this wacky, undead-infested realm, you'll find yourself laughing, facepalming, and wondering if the game developers were dropped on their heads as babies. But fear not, because that's precisely what makes this game so delightfully absurd!

Let's address the elephant in the room right away: the lack of content. ""Yet Another Zombie Survival"" boldly embraces its own mediocrity by providing you with the bare minimum. You'll wander through a seemingly endless expanse of cookie-cutter environments that make the concept of ""exploration"" feel as exciting as watching paint dry. Seriously, who needs diversity when you can have the same tree repeated a thousand times?

Now, onto the character progression, or rather, the complete lack thereof. Prepare yourself for a journey so linear that it would make a stick look like a complex geometric shape. Your character upgrades are as predictable as a broken record

But hey, amidst all the lackluster content and linear character progression, ""Yet Another Zombie Survival"" manages to find its charm. It's like a B-movie you can play, with hilariously cheesy dialogue and absurd situations that make you question the sanity of the game designers. It's a game where you can battle zombies with a rubber chicken or launch exploding watermelons at them. Who needs logic when you have watermelon grenades, right?

In conclusion, ""Yet Another Zombie Survival"" may lack content and offer a character progression system that puts a straight line to shame, but it embraces its flaws and turns them into a comedic experience. It's a game that doesn't take itself seriously, and in turn, encourages you not to take it seriously either. So, if you're in the mood for a mindless, laughter-filled zombie apocalypse romp, grab your sense of humor and join the madness!

Hi devs, I don't know how you managed to make a game where all you do is play keep-away this fun, but you did. The gameplay is super addicting, and this game has absurd amounts of potential.

That said, there are definitely balance issues:

Second-tier Engineer weapons feel underpowered, and while the laser looks satisfying, it doesn't do enough damage to make it useful. The blaster looks less satisfying, but does more damage, though still not enough to warrant investing in if it can be avoided, which it kind of can't. Boost the laser damage a bunch, and slow the blaster balls; they also would benefit from AOE love of some kind.

The third-tier Ninja weapon is... not good. You can barely see it, and you certainly don't see the effects of it. It needs a visual overhaul, and the kunai need to be at least as big as the shuriken, which are also underpowered. A third-tier ability should feel like doom on wheels. 

I haven't unlocked everything, these are just my observations thus far.

The game describes what it is from the get go before you even buy it and I like that, it's not hiding what it is. However what it is, isn't engaging for me for the most part. I know it's supposed to be just simple, but it's just too simple for me. Don't mistake that as me being an elitist snob; i see how the movement is actually very involved, true to the spirit of bullet hell. As the game progresses, more special enemies will have bigger and harder hitting AOE damage. Squad progression is cool and actually does influence how you move. But all you do is just move. It's not enough for me to be hooked. Honestly if I just had more buttons to play with and more control over my characters and abilities, I could very easily be hooked like everyone else. I wanted to keep my mind open to this type of game as I don't play these types of bullet hell's often (I.E vampire survivors) but it's not for me. If you enjoy turning your brain off and upgrading stuff to be more effective at killing stuff, definitely scratches that itch. I'm leaving a positive because I can definitely see why people will like it, nothing here so far been a big enough negative or abhorrent in design for me to complain about in terms of how the gameplay design is set. They have a solid foundation with stuff to sink your time. It's just the gameplay itself doesn't do it for me. Maybe if the devs decide to include an alternate control scheme for me to have more control over it, but I highly doubt that they'd listen to a very niche complaint like mine.

For a game of this type, the price tag is high and yet it has the least content at the moment it launched in early access of any similar game that I played. There's 1 very small map that takes ~20 sec to run across in a straight line and 6 characters total.

Balancing is bad. Character's weapon can be evolved 2 times. The first evolution is, in my opinion, always a direct upgrade. The final evolution however feels like a downgrade or sidegrade at best in almost every case. Most items unlocked by achievements are garbage and only serve to dilute the selection pool when you pick up the chest. It's quite possible the only game of this type that I played where unlocking achievements feels bad because of that.

When we exclude all the crap that eventually clutters the item selection, we're left with a very barebones selection of items that are actually useful, which again, have balance issues. 10% fire rate and -10% reload time aren't exactly equal. Neither are 5% damage and 5% crit damage.

You have no ability to aim manually, it's only automatic. You WILL die because your characters refuse to shoot at zombies in front of you and instead target randomly. It does prioritize closest enemies, but it's meaningless when you're trying to move, and this game requires you to move to get pickups for level ups and items.

Your hitbox is MASSIVE - significantly larger than the characters you're controlling. This largely removes the skill factor from dodging. Hitbox is too large to get around enemies.",1689539545,1689539545,False,3,0,0.4451446533203125,0,True,False,True

-I like the party system and the meta progression feels meaningful. 
-I also like the rescue and item pick ups in map, even if you get strong enough to stay near stationary you have an incentive to move around.

It is early access and the bugs i saw aren't worth mentioning (no crashes) but I would like to highlight two game design issues I have.
1. Your hit box feels too big. I might just be a symptom of the fast zombies snapping 180 to swing at you and the mini boss attacks not being well defined. It was bad enough at low meta progression i considered uninstalling and refunding.
2. The medic feels like crap. Shes the last one you'll probably unlock and her weapon kit gets worse as you level it. Her abilities are a waste of a squad spot because you sacrifice so much damage for healing you've already learned to itemize for prior to unlocking her. She feels this bad because the other 5 characters all feel great. Her weapons need an overhaul and I would like to see her passive heal include an over heal (shield) so its distinct from regen/life steal items.",1689530081,1689530081,True,35,0,0.794248819351196289,0,True,False,True

This achievement is very easy to achieve.

First of all, the easiest one needs a tanker.

0. Starting in hardcore mode.
The reason for doing it on hardcore is that zombies with the most hardcore attract the most.

1. Maximum upgrade of weapon to pump action shot gun, fill experience bar almost to level up.

2. Gather as many zombies as you can..

3. When at least 30 zombies are gathered, level up and acquire a rocket.

The concept of using 3 characters with each their own weapons and skills is a nice new take on the genre. Which is definitely it's strongest attribute. In addition it moves away from the fantasy to the zombie modern age style which is also a nice pace of change. 

One of the downsides I encountered though, even though I personally thought it was value for it's money, it does start with rather limited content with only having 1 map and 6 classed for the listed price (10 euros), which is rather steep for a bullet hell with this amount of content. Then again it is still in early access so I see this expanding in to a great game. Right now due to this does get a bit repetitive (mostly the map) as you cannot alternate this. 

Just as a shout out for those that played the other Zombie defender game of the same maker, (great game) this is not the same, there is no base building or wave defending, its just endless waves.

Pro
[list]
[*] 3 man party is new and fun to experiment with
[*] Challenge is at a good level, especially Endless and Hardcore
[*] Interesting classes and ability
[*] Nice graphics
[*] Complimenting classes
[*] Infinite support item pick up! (really like this)
[*] Follows the bullet hell principles well and makes it a fun way to play
[/list]

Cons
[list]
[*] Limited content (at time of review) (1 Map, 6 Classes) 
[*] No ability combos (would be nice to see)
[*] Some glitches with the bosses (super speed after being frozen, sometimes at high difficulty level they teleport etc)
[*] Frustrating rerolls (exactly the same offering, multiple times in a row)
[*] Damage output for some of the ""DPS"" classes is off. Hope this get balanced more in future updates.

The variety of enemies and maps resembles that of a mobile game, which does not bode well for its future potential.

Realistically, it's hard to imagine how they could enhance the gameplay to make it truly attractive. It might entertain you for a couple of hours (I personally spent more time due to my obsession with Steam achievements), but it's just a title you'd let your younger sibling play while you're on the PlayStation.

Despite my reluctance to compare games, I must say that no matter how many updates it gets, I can't see how it could compete with genre stalwarts like Vampire Survivors. In conclusion, this game fails to live up to the expectations set by its price point. There are surely more robust and exciting alternatives available on Steam.

There are plenty of games out there 1/3 or even 1/4 of this price that will provide you with infinitely more fun and content as well as creativity.

What is available right now is bare bones. Outside of just having to grind to unlock characters (I've put 4 hours in literally doing as much focus as I can to unlock the Medic which is to collect an absurd number of health packs), you then have to grind just to get more options for them. Then once you have a character you have to grind just to unlock their full potential (which some of the higher tier guns are just worse than the previous).

It's is definitely one of the games that doesn't respect your time for the lack of content there is right now. It definitely has potential, I like the systems that are there, it just needs more content and some tweaks.",1689447708,1689475678,False,59,3,0.670921862125396729,0,True,False,True

It's a fun game, the basic loop is good - but it's BASIC, it's a decent and potentially great addition to the genre, but it's also lacking in content, depth, and longevity.  Hence the ""potentially"" and it IS early access.  One cannot expect every game that hits EA to be nearly bug free and release ready already - some games actually do early access as DEV.  But, since many games DO hit EA in more robust condition, the thumb is sideways for now. (haven't noticed any bugs, myself, btw)

One map, minimal/no build variation, a lot of lackluster weapons/abilities, oddly balanced upgrade tree/pace/something ain't right - generic as can be ""trinkets"" (yellow chest boons).

Overall one feels like this could be so much more than what it is, and one hopes the game gets there during early access.  If it doesn't, it'll still be a ""good"" game as it is, I'll just be absolutely, crushingly, devastatingly disappointed.  Sad panda, yo.

Graphics might be considered better than some and fun factor is up there especially if you enjoy some good old zombie smashing.

As others have said, you can find and play better similar games for less, but eventually you exhaust or get tired of those great games and want some variety.  This does work for that variety and $10 or $8 on sale is really not expensive when you're talking games that are usually $3-15.  If it were AAA titles going for the new $70 ea, it'd be one thing, but for a whopping $8 or 10 you may as well cut loose and have a little fun, ya?

Ignore the review that said the guy beat the first level in an hour on his 2nd play-through, because it's not possible. 2nd play-through you won't last more than 15 minutes, no matter what you do. Then he says that's all the content. Not even close to the truth. The game has 3 modes, that includes a hard mode and an endless mode. You can't even play the other 2 until you unlock them by playing and unlocking other power-ups and perks. It has 6 characters already that I know of thus far. 3 have to be unlocked and they all have level upgrades. I gave that guy a jester award and a funny face. (Wish there was a clown or dunce award.)
Anyway, this game is awesome and has plenty to do for the cheap price. Pick it up if you liked the other survivor type games.  I see at least 25 plus hours to full complete everything.

-Fun systems of 3 teams to build

Cons
-It so bare bones that you'll see more ""coming soon"" than a theater. 
-No skill transformations. 
-Weapons ""level up"" can sometimes be into worse forms.
-Life-steal and dodge only viable items, others have too little impact to be worthwhile. 
-Some skills are just bad or worthless. 
-CDs on skills seem excessive vs the dmg or effects they do, weapons do generally better. 
-Some items not explained or just plain worthless. Happiness stat not explained (Seems to affect rate of S.O.S. and item drops).

1.Visual clarity simplification, i find often a sprinter or a caustic shot can hit me in all the glows of certain attacks or visual clutter.
2.The possibility of multiplayer in a SAS4 like sense would be great for the future! Or also a open modding framework to allow for community input.(The game is new and i don't expect this soon.)
3.Over time i hope to see the bosses overhauled visually and there attacks to make them more interactive and visually scary and fun!

First off I think the devs are doing an amazing job with this and can't wait to see where they take this game. I like the new additions they've added on and I think it will be amazing when we get a full fledged gameplay experience. For now, its still pretty much a beta game with the one level. But for the $8-$10 your paying you don't get enough to justify the price from the experience you got by just playing the demo version which is one of the biggest drawbacks. You still only get the one level, granted it's only been a few months since then and they probably need to fund the game.

This is a very promising rogue-like filled with zombies that has a lot of potential to be a must own for fans of the genre. One of the biggest critiques I have is that the zombies feel a lot weaker than the demo they had out, but I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it's because of the S.O.S. beacons and new power ups they've added in and never really compensated the zombies for that. They definitely need some better defense. Bosses are also very weak and boring, just constantly charging at you while being nothing more than a distraction from the rest of the horde following you around. They're supposed to get more dangerous as the level progresses but you basically just delete everything and don't really notice them too much. The additions of power ups and player stats were very nice, the lifesteal could be redone though as I felt I was still getting too much even at 5% when you have a full team of 3 just constantly pumping out dps. Also, removing auto-aim would be nice. 


I recommend this only because I think its going places and the devs are doing a great job. Id love to see more.

This is a fantastic game with the same formula but provides its own spin in terms of flavor and gameplay. I have been playing the game on my steam deck and haven't been able to put it down, except to recharge the deck occasionally.

The premise of the game is simple. Pick a class and survive the night against hordes of zombies for 20 minutes until daylight. You occasionally get S.O.S signals using which you can recruit a party member and upgrade them as well, instead of doing this solo. Or if you want to do it solo, liberate them and keep going. You also get crates that contain interesting bonuses that help the run. Some of these need balancing without a doubt (looking at you % health bonuses - 3 of these and every health pack heals you for a quarter of your max HP), but it keeps the game fresh and enjoyable, adding an element of randomness. The skills are fun and the weapons have a punch to them. It is satisfying to see the skills and weapons cut through the zombies, accentuated by the ragdoll physics.

Unlike some other games in the genre, there is really no point at which you overpower the game. Until the 20 minute mark, it is a constant battle of skill and speed. This was a refreshing change compared to other games where the first few levels are tough, but once you unlock a few key skills, you can hold down the directional keys with one hand and sip a latte using the other, cruising your way to victory. Here, the game in fact gets harder as time goes on, and the challenge gets higher as you get more powerful, so you are constantly on your toes.

In terms of performance, the game ran smoothly almost throughout each run. Granted, there was a run with a couple of moments when some frames dropped and I experienced a brief stutter, but it was a one-time thing. This didn't happen on any subsequent run though, so overall, it isn't a concern. It is also the perfect game for the steam deck. Pick up and play, pause the game and suspend it if you need to take a break, come back and seamlessly resume your run.

All in all, a solid game in the reverse bullet hell genre that is definitely worth playing.",1689298838,1689299507,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

I have 10 hours in the demo, and I've also played the demo before they 'updated' the demo (read: removed Huntress). That being said, I think it's really dumb that there wasn't another map all ready to go on launch. EA or not, that time should have been spent having another ready to go.

The game is currently in Early Access, but it already offers a lot of fun and challenge for fans of the genre.

The game lets you choose from multiple characters, each with their own special skills and upgrades. You can also customize your weapons and abilities to suit your playstyle and strategy. The game is fast-paced and chaotic, but also rewarding and satisfying when you manage to survive and evolve.

The game has only one level/map so far, but it's well-designed and varied enough to keep you entertained for hours. The graphics are colorful and cartoony, and the sound effects are fitting and immersive. The game also has a meta-progression system that lets you unlock more content and features as you play.

The game is not perfect, of course. It still has some bugs and glitches, and it could use more polish and optimization. The game also lacks some features that would make it more replayable and engaging, such as more maps/environments, more enemy types and variations, additional gameplay modifiers, and a complete meta-progression system.

However, the developers are very responsive and open to feedback from the community. They have a suggestions' forum on their Discord server and a pinned thread on the Steam forum where they listen to players' ideas and opinions. 

Overall, Yet Another Zombie Survivors is a great game for anyone who loves action, roguelike, RPG, or bullet hell games. It's simple but fun, addictive but challenging, and cheap but worth it. If you're looking for a new game to play with your friends or by yourself, give this one a try. You won't regret it.

I DID refund the game but not because it was not fun but because there is basically nothing new content wise to sink more hours into. I would say to the Devs that they should have held off from releasing until there was at least 2 more maps available, i can see the ''Coming Soon'' where the maps would be but these days you never know if a dev is going to actually add content. Id say to anyone looking at buying this to play the demo and ask yourself if you would see yourself playing this for more than 5 hours in its current state. Ill be adding this game to my wish list and repurchasing it when more content is available.

It does not really add much to the well estabilshed formula. But what it does, it does pretty well.  What I have not seen in other games so far is the addition of other playable characters with all its perks (during a run) that supports you and can be upgraded just like you can upgrade your own character. So you have more choices of weapons which is always a plus. Also (though highly subjective) I like that this game does not have the typical retro or cartoonish look. For a game at this price point, it really looks pretty good.

So, if you are not tired of the genre yet, I do not see a reason to recommend it. Also, the approach to include the community on the way to the gold status is certainly commendable.

Okay, one thing I like to compain about is the music: It sounds pretty cheap and does not add to the atmopshere of the game. Also, a bit more diversity would be nice. I got Ridge Racer vibes for some reason. Not good in my opinion. 

So, overall, a cool studio that already showed with Fury Unleashed that they know what they are doing. I really think you will not be disappointed if you look for yet another reverse bullet hell shooter.",1689279610,1689279610,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game is just as fun and should not be overlooked in this overloaded genre. I have played a lot of them and believe this one can hang with the best of them even in early access. This game will be improved upon based off of the studio's track record, but what you get here is a very fun zombie slaughter fest a lot of fun ways to extinguish the horde. I've been experimenting and just completed my first run with the huntress as my leader. Spread the word about this one and reward this studio.",1689277166,1689277166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I like the more arcadey feel with it and it visually looks wonderful, even if hit detection can be a bit wonky. But I do hope they keep the larger hit box for the group as you add more members, I like how you not only gain more firepower, but also become a larger target. 

Anyway, it feels like a great foundation for them to build upon. If Survivor-likes are your thing, I think this is an easy recommend.
