-Increase turn rates.
-Make abilities more impactful and have higher cooldowns.
-Rein in the mobility powercreep.
-Add more synergies and meaningful team mechanics. It's supposed to be a team game after all.
This is basically one of those brainless APM clickspam games. No strategy, no countering, no depth, just click and move your cursor faster bro.
All the elements of a good game are here, too bad it's squandered on shallow League of Legends combat.",1708398574,1708399038,False,3,0,0.485370039939880371,0,True,False,False

Right now there's only realistically 4-5 servers running and I hear EU servers arent always up and if you're like me who lives in Australia which needs a Oceania server which doesnt exist then you're looking about 250 ping to play which lags liike crazy on Asia & US server.
Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

UPDATE 2: The good news is that other servers are up but unfortunately it's leaving players wants to support that are in the Oceania region super dead clearly the devs should be more transparent about this so now they just seem to avoid the question all together........",1603686610,1618571165,False,51,0,0.664182424545288086,6,True,False,True
