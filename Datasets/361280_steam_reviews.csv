_________________________________________________________
Turmoil has become my go-to game to play when something is on in the background and I need just a little more mental stimulation. The game requires no long-term planning whatsoever and the gameplay loop will really determine your mileage:
The base game campaign begins with you having no equipment, very little seed money, and overall does a good job introducing you to the 'upgrades' you can purchase in town. But here there's major flaws: The 'upgrades' don't feel like real improvements because any upgrade you purchase ($15K-$40K) merely unlocks the option to pay to upgrade that function in each mining session. For example: You pay $15K to unlock wagons which can carry more oil. But then when you go to deploy wagons, you have to pay a hefty $750 in any given session to actually enable that bonus. The same goes for tunneling speed, pipe width, silo size, and wagon speed. 
In short, every upgrade you purchase is just you unlocking the right to purchase it again every single level. This makes progression feel weak.
Secondly, the stock auction in the base game is based on the dutch auction, which is an interesting historical auction method, but it's also highly annoying when you're working with highly inconsistent AI. 
_______________
I have spent nearly all my time in the game playing the DLC ""the heat is on"" which completely removes the dutch auction in favor of the traditional auction style. I also like that the DLC includes the expert mode's character abilities that add some nice flavor to the gameplay. 

Overall I can't recommend this game to anyone unless it's on a good sale, and even then you must be ok with a gameplay loop that never changes. The AI you play against is fickle at best and will cease to be any challenge to you (at any difficulty) once you realize that they're not programmed to think strategically about stock accumulation or attaining upgrades.",1705074141,1705074141,True,17,0,0.716623365879058838,0,True,False,False

If I don't get an hour of fun out of a game for each dollar it costs, then it's usually an automatic 'not recommended' from me, and there's no way in hell how this game could give even 2hours of entertainment. I'm already bored with it after just 50minutes. Maybe the game could have been fun if it didn't have different maps and instead just had one map like [u]Steamworld Dig[/u] or [u]Galactic Mining Corp[/u] does because that would have made the game's appeal a lot  longer lasting because it would be fun to see how deep you could go. I just can't recommend the game because it's not fun, and it's for sale in russia as well

Once learned, you will find yourself trying to find and extract oil while avoiding too much production/spillage while at the same time trying to find and get it all out of the ground while adjusting transportation to obtain the best sale price. A fine balance and timing! 

Timing is everything in this great little business and exploration scenario. Strategy and economics apply as you seek deposits to exploit and out finance your opponents into submission via the stock market between rounds. Bid on land to drill and buy stock in the town. Upgrade upgrade upgrade your tools and equipment for maximum efficiency! Be careful though, if you make an error is a bit unforgiving. Some blunders can end like a rouge type adventure. Game over! But, you will start again, and do better next try. 

Understanding how gas deposits enhance pricing will be beneficial. Again, timing and preparation for the gas extracting is paramount. If done correctly, you can elevate the oil prices and who knows, maybe become world famous on the leader board and record books!

One of the most remarkable features of Turmoil is its simplicity and depth. The game has an intuitive user interface that makes it easily accessible, yet it offers a wealth of decisions and challenges that allow players to test and improve their entrepreneurial skills.

Another outstanding feature of Turmoil is its graphic design. The game has beautiful hand-drawn graphics that perfectly fit the Wild West theme. The sound effects and music also create an authentic atmosphere.

Players have the opportunity to build their own oil company, from exploring oil fields to buying land and equipment, and selling the extracted oil. They must make strategic decisions to keep their company profitable.

Turmoil's replayability is another strength. Each game is unique, as the positioning of oil fields and oil prices vary from game to game, presenting players with new challenges and decisions.

One potential drawback of Turmoil is that it may feel somewhat repetitive after a while, as it has a limited number of levels that may repeat.

Overall, Turmoil is a unique, entertaining, and challenging game suitable for strategy fans and those who want to become one. With its unique graphics, authentic atmosphere, and deep gameplay concept, Turmoil is definitely a game that everyone should try.",1676274850,1677177301,True,4,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

Player takes control of an oil company, prospecting for oil over a series of territories. They compete with opponents (human or AI) to get the best plots of land and eventually buy out the local mineral rights. On the way, they have to upgrade their equipment (making it faster and more valuable to find oil deposits, etc.). The oil-drilling sessions take about 15 minutes to play and they are fun!

The style of the game is cartoon-y and engaging, and the tutorial/progression in the game is great. 

All this said - it's not a game for everyone. I've had friends play it and basically turn in after the first oil-drilling session. I recommend giving it a play, if you don't enjoy it right away, don't bother buying it.",1673057247,1673057247,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's fun for a few hours but the AI provides no challenge, the upgrades don't really matter after the few starters ones and the auction systems are useless (why would I compete for a plot that has maybe a little more oil, when I'm already making 3x what the AI is making no matter what?).

Like a dead beat father who briefly returns home, only to be reminded that the new Call of Duty just came out and would rather do that instead.

The dead beat father returns home, a feeling of elation as he turns on his XBox 360... excited to play Chapter 4 of Fortnite. But then he realizes that he can't in fact play the newest Fortnite and resorts to watching Corn on the internet telly. But he lives deep in the projects with his acquaintance/drug dealer/lord and that he has only 1 bar on his cell phone connection through Virgin Mobile. He opens up Tik Tok on his T-Mobile side kick from 2oo8 and finds out his phone is also outdated.

No more Fortnite and no Wet *** ***** videos for him. It all seems dire, until he realizes that his kids have Fortnite and Tik Tok so he musters up courage once again that day and returns home. When he gets there, his kids have all grown up, went to college, got married and had kids of their own. It was at this point he reveled that his grandkids probably have Fortnite and TikTok. All he has to do is find them.

There aren't any cutscenes to bore you to death and you don't have to pay attention to a story. The townspeople are mildly amusing. I thought of Factorio when I played. (I always do). Factorio cost me $20 compared to Turmoil $10 but Factorio is a way of life, a religion and probably the supreme crafting, survival, whatever game. Its a religion and an addiction. Its not fair that this game sells for half its price, but its not bad and is probably better than 98% of the games on Steam.

Do I find myself wanting to play the game while I'm doing something else like surfing the web? Yes. I often think, ""I'd like to give that another go."" To me that's one of the more important qualities of a game.  Its something to go to when you're a little bored, even if you finished the campaign. The single player on the bonus island can be completed in about 20 minutes and it offers a lot of challenge and replay value and yet it won't take up your whole day like some games. The map can change with each play or not so that does keep it fresh. Juggling time limits and the need to drain oil and gas and produce a maximum profit ensures your mind will be busy with strategic thinking. I just wish I could more precisely lay pipes to use every bit of space for expanding gas. And I don't think it would hurt to include an optional pause to work on things while paused. 

I've played a little more now and one thing that keeps me coming back is that it was easy to figure out how to get started but it also has this thermal upgrade. You can surround pockets of gas with pipes to heat up the gas and expand it. In effect you are taking a small pocket of gas and turning it into a huge pocket. This can be used to drive up the price of oil at the incs  where your wagons deliver oil. It takes time though and your time is limited. You also have to be careful not to vent your gas through your drilling rigs. This will drive oil to the surface faster, but it won't increase the price of oil. At first this looks simple but there's a fine line between making 10,000 or  250,000. It can be pretty hard to do the later but often you end up with about 60,000. You know you can do better. That's how the game keeps you coming back.  Its a really nice, original game mechanic in a cheap game. Thats why I think Turmoil is exceptional. Good gameplay, plus something really clever that I've never seen before in any game.

All in all this game offers the best strategic thinking in years and it uses gameplay mechanics I've never seen before.",1661459666,1662396570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its rules and logic are a bit quirky, but once you've learned them, you'll get better at it the more you play. Sounds obvious, but I'm just saying it's a little tricky at first, and the learning-curve isn't that steep or at least big.
It does need a little re-balancing in the difficulty, as ""Normal"" quickly becomes too easy and ""Expert"" (which you unlock after completing the campaign on Normal difficulty) is way more balanced and challenging. The latter can be punishing at some points, but at least it gives a challenge. - So, in my view, there really should be a new ""Normal"" difficulty that falls between the current ""Normal"" and ""Expert"". If not, just rework ""Normal"" and add an optional ""Easy"" or ""Introductory"" mode for first-time players and such, then only let ""Normal"" and ""Expert"" count for real.

Other than that, it's one of those games that are easy to get into and have the potential to become addicting for a while. It does get a little repetitive, as there's a rather tight gameplay-loop, so it's not something for hundreds of hours, perhaps not even dozens. But it's definitely a nice game to play for an hour or two every day for a while and then let go of again and come back to later.",1660643533,1660655852,True,2,0,0.523364484310150146,0,True,False,False

About pulling every dirty trick in the book without running afoul of silly things like antitrust laws or ethics. About discovering oil, then ravaging the pristine western wilderness with your oil rigs and your silos and your wagons and bribing folks to sell as high as you can to the two anarchronisticly wonder gas stations on either side of your screen.

Works you brain, but doesn't tug at your emotions. It's really kind of zen to play. I've played the original SO MANY TIMES, and finally finished campaign mode of The Heat Is On. 

The Heat is On is WAY HARDER at the beginning than the original was, and I found I had to make a lot more use of the on-the-spot loans in the oilfield to be able to make any profit. Once you have all the magma tech though, the delightful science-ish ness of messing with the elements with heat is SO FUN. Make sure you watch a video of how to make the magma interact with the gas. I didn't, so the first part was super hard. But I really enjoyed it by the end.

Where as the AI get 1$ off the start then they get to keep it at that till end of term.  So yeah that's happened to me over 150 times please fix that.  Because players are at a major disadvantage from the start and you don't get to pick your land off the start, and 9 times out of 10 the AI gets a High oil rates like 50+ sometimes even 70+.

Such an incredibly enjoyable game with absolutely no obligations at any time. You can just play a simple level and never even need to start the campaign to experience what is most enjoyable about Turmoil, the oil mining sections. But if you truly want the full experience, you must play the campaign. It changes the region you mine in every now and again to keep it fresh and exciting at all times. There is an abundance of upgrades you can acquire to make your oil drilling excursions more eventful and effective. There is truly no comparison to this game, it is absolutely a one-of-a-kind experience. I only wish I could experience it all over again. The learning curve is here, and it is relatively forgiving as there are so many levels to redeem yourself if you mess up in previous levels, you can come back from a lousy start in no time which in a game like this, is vitally important.

My problem with the game is that there not much really happens. Each stage is basically the same thing but with a few obstacles. I completed the campaign in around 4ish hours and after that there's really not much to do other than replay it. I wish there was an endless level with no timer and unlimited space.

I would personally wait for it to go on sale since it doesn't have too much going on in the game overall. I bought it for $4.99 and I think that was an okay price for it, but I would probably recommend getting it cheaper if you can. I know there is mobile version of this for $5 or $6 (I think) so if it isn't on sale I would recommend buying it there if you want to try it out.",1530754447,1644223554,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's quite addictive but after an hour or two I have to take a break.

As the game goes on things get more complicated and it's not just about digging as much oil as you can. Some levels have very limited oil and the only way to make a profit is to store your oil until the very end and try and jack the price up with gas. Very intense micromanaging!

I've been playing all different types of games for ages (since the early days of video games), and this is surprisingly great. The graphics are simple, the rules/gameplay are not too involved, yet it manages to grab my attention and make me want to keep playing for long periods of time. 
Each level is pretty short (maybe a 15 minute investment) with good upgrade options between levels. And as you go through the campaign you get new mechanics and upgrades introduced at a reasonable pace to keep it feeling a bit fresh.

My only real complaint is that some of the mechanics later in the game that you can utilize seem difficult enough to take advantage of that it seems to make sense to just not use them.  You get these natural-gas pockets later in the game that you can use to make more money, but I found more often than not, it was easier just to ignore them and keep going about your businesses as if they weren't there.  Mostly because it would take more time to make them work properly than you had available for each dig.

When this update is installed automatically any campaign you currently have going is incompatible with the new update so you need to start over or know to have auto updates turned off but I decided to start over and give the (now automatically installed update) a try, boy was that a huge mistake.
After starting a new campaign and playing about a half dozen turns I really screwed up a level really bad so I decided to quit halfway through the year and restart, guess what, I can't because the game freaking saves your game in the middle of the year so a single mistake can completely screw you over to the point where recovery may not be possible.
Now sure there is a way to undo the update to go back to the old version of the game but I never thought to write it down and for some reason it is not noted anywhere in game like on the title screen where you know it would be very handy to have so people like me could use the version of the game we (used to) enjoy playing.

Simple for pugs, very challenging to master (but you don't have to!), great replayability in all cases and addictive game play with RNG that is not at the core of the game mechanics (the RNG determines amount and placement of resources on each level but there are ways to mitigate that through tech/exploration - it's a good application of RNG that avoids it getting anywhere close to rogues while still keeping things unpredictable and spicy). 

TL;DR: amazing game at a great price, plus the devs are reworking it currently so a new iteration en-route. Cannot recommend highly enough for an addictive little casual pug game with actual SPINE and challenge too. Impressed.

This is a simple yet addictive oil mining strategy. You can bribe the authority to turn a blind eye when your mining rig does accidental spillage, you can bribe oil company to set a certain oil price and you can hire a mole (literally a mole) to dig and find oil reservoir for you.

Sure the graphics and interface are simple, but that's good for people who don't have time for a steep learning curve game.

I needed something simple to play as I listen to podcasts and was a bit bored with solitaire.

The game is easy to get into. Nicely guides you into playing it adding new things as you go.
In the end it does offer a challenge but nothing overwhelming (although I have only just played through the first part of the campaign. Not sure how hard it gets after that).

What you do in the game is you put up an oil pump, drill a pipe down and hope you'll hit oil. 
There are some ways to enhance your chances of finding the oil, like a mole that digs down and reveals random spots.
Then, when you have the pipe in an oil pocket, oil starts pouring out and you can sell it. The price of the oil changes, so you have to manage which two companies to sell it to or you can also storage it.
In the campaign mode between digs you go back to town where you can buy upgrades and see if you sold more oil than 3 competing AI characters.

In Turmoil, you are a would-be oil baron somewhere in midwestish America. Each turn you choose a site to drill for oil and dig up as much as you can before time runs out, selling to the highest bidder (either RED or BLU). The more you sell, the more persistent upgrades you can buy to make it easier in the next turn. 

It's really fun and it's simple. Once you get the hang of it, I imagine you'll have no problem clearing levels to 100% drained every time. Unfortunately, that's where Turmoil kind of breaks down. It's too easy; the AI opponents hardly earn anything and there aren't enough features to play long term. It feels like it needed more options or hazards while staying in theme.

Fun little Management Sim, find the oil, build your wells, make $$$$$, buy the upgrades in town, and now make more $$$$, rinse and repeat until you win. There is some strategy to it as sometime it is better to save your oil until the price goes up, so it will keep you on your toes a little bit.

Pros
Its a fun a simple game that you will get better at each time
Easy to learn
Nothing is better then finding a huge oil deposit!!

I will probably play it some more, but I am surprised by the Very Positive overall reviews. It does have a charm to it, both the graphics and characters, so maybe that's part of it. It's also possible people like it as a low commitment game for relaxing. It just isn't my thing personally. I'll elaborate.

There just isn't a ton to this game from what I can tell. It's an inexpensive indie game so this isn't unexpected, but I don't see anything that makes it engaging outside of the classic feedback loop of gathering a resource (in this case money) so that you can unlock upgrades that help you gather said resource faster/more efficiently. That formula can work well in my experience if the game is more engaging in other ways such as introducing new mechanics more frequently, having some kind of story to progress, having mini games, etc.

First, I don't even get the land bidding piece, it feels pointless. As far as I can tell there is no indication as to how good a particular plot of land is going to be so you are just blindly bidding. Since you are playing against AI and you always get to go first, the result is that you click a random plot of land and they either outbid you or pick a different plot. If they outbid you on the plot you picked you can bid even higher or simply pick a different plot. Since you have no way of knowing if the plot is even good and aren't playing against real people that you might have motives against, there is no incentive to outbid the AI ever, so you just end up picking a new plot every time to keep the cost at the minimum 2k. So the land bidding comes down to a mandatory 2k payment to get into the next instance, like throwing your ante in during a poker game. If I am missing something, joke's on me I guess.

So far it looks like the upgrades are mostly around the units/mechanics you start off with. You have guys that find oil, so here's an upgrade to have them do it faster, and another that allows them to find it deeper. You have wagons that cart the oil around, so here's an upgrade to give them more capacity. Here's an upgrade to make your oil rig use larger pipes so you can drain oil at a faster pace, and here's another to make it so you can branch multiple pipes off one joint to make pipe pathing more convenient, etc.

At one point you unlock a saloon where you can find the various shop keepers at random and they offer you seemingly randomized deals that are related to what they do or vend. For instance, you might be able to invest money into one of the oil purchasing companies to ensure their price doesn't drop below a certain amount for the next map, or you might be able to pay the warden guy to look the other way if you spill oil rather than fining you, or you might be able to pay the banker to lower the interest rate on loans, etc. This does add a bit of additional strategy to the game I suppose because it's a matter of deciding whether the cost is worth the return, but it's still just a way of modifying the cost of available services to keep spinning the feedback loop faster/slower.

My main problem with all this is that the gameplay feels like it boils down to just revising your strategy with the things you already have at each upgrade juncture until you find the most efficient way to use it (I can use 2 oil rigs now instead of 3 with the same number of horses because the rigs are grabbing oil faster). It's just constant min-maxing with the payoff being having to min-max again because the speed/capacity/cost of a particular thing changed when you spent your resource you took all that time gathering efficiently. Maybe I paid one of the oil companies to keep its price up, so maybe I made a bit more money this go around because I always had a decent price to sell at, but it doesn't really change the way I am doing things, it's just more or less money earned in an allocated amount of time. It is infrequent that you get something new and get to see if it makes sense to include it in your process.

Based on the upgrades I can actually see at this time, I would imagine end-game is something along the lines of:

*Use the scanner to find all of the oil on your map instantly, bypassing the need to use the guys to find it (I assume that's what the scanner does).
*Set up rigs and pipes to grab all the oil as quickly as possible since you are fully upgraded.
*Sell or store the oil to sell at a good price, but as fast as possible until the oil on the map is gone.
*End the map early so that you get part of your land lease cost back, maximizing profits.
*Rinse, repeat to make this process as efficient as possible to end the map as early as possible each time while still maximizing earnings from selling oil to get the most overall profit possible per map.

To conclude, in my opinion the grind to get the upgrades is boring, and being fully upgraded also sounds boring.

If you are looking for a game to kill time relatively mindlessly, this one isn't bad, but I am happy I got it for $2 - I don't think it's a $10 game as it essentially feels like a mobile game or an old flash/browser game. For me, I could kill time just as effortlessly with countless free mobile games from the comfort of my couch or the lounger in my sunroom and it would be more relaxing due to the real world setting.

If you did want to play a more relaxing game with similar progression in terms of upgrades but more interesting gameplay, I might suggest Factory Idle which is a free browser game. It requires you to upgrade intelligently according to your current bottlenecks and place all of your components in a deliberate way to maximize the space you have to work with in a grid system. I suppose it lacks the charm of this game, but personally that wears off rather quickly anyway.",1624549124,1624549124,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The current state of campaign is very disappointing. The other NPCs barely purchase upgrades and somehow remain extremely profitable. This results in the NPCs overpaying for the towns shares.

How do you expect me to purchase a $40,000-$60,000 upgrade when the other NPCs are disposing massive amounts of their capital into town shares? It feels like I have to avoid every high-tier upgrade in order to compete. Right now, in order to win the campaign, I have to play the entire game barely purchasing upgrades. 

Due to the fact that you cannot currently utilise the upgrades, the game becomes extremely repetitive and aggravating. If the game was re-worked so that other NPC's also purchased a realistic amount of upgrades to remain profitable in the end game, or decrease the cost of upgrades all around, this game would be amazing.

There's some strategy/simulation play but it's mostly managing money between stages. The per stage money and resource management is very tight, it's a good engaging set of problems each time. Sometimes the oil is kind, sometimes it is behind rocks. The dowser whistles and he points, mocking you. He knows you keep putting off the drill upgrade because you're buying land shares too aggressively. Each time you tell yourself ""that's the last $500 crooked pipeline I make to get a pocket behind rock, this time I'll be smart."" But then you hire the next pair of dowsers, resenting them instead of yourself. It's the next level. You barge into the bar angrily, demanding to see Anthony. He's not in. The vein at the mine has run dry and times are tough, he has to go further out each time. You don't care. You need to know what land to buy. You're going to have to take awful risks this time. You drink to numb the pain and see if a few guys the mechanic knows are available for union busting. It wasn't supposed to be this hard, this messy. You're afraid to sleep because last time you did you woke up talking to the mole you appointed as the dig site foreman. He can recognize diamonds and natural gas in the land and report it back to humans, he tells you.

Anyway. It's a pretty simple and light-hearted aesthetic, the meat is in optimizing your gameplay in each stage. You start off with little risk vs reward(pipe length vs overshooting the oil pocket vs costs of multiple connected lengths) and grow from there(storing oil, when to sell, how many horses and when, avoiding spills) until you're trying to set up a labyrinthian mass of pipes to heat gas pockets, stockpile oil and unleash a 10,000 Psi Combo. Managing money in town is another tight-fisted mess of risk vs reward, the constant demand for new tech eclipsing any comfort you might feel at having finally gotten out of the red. Your peers are ruthless, black chasms where their hearts should be. There isn't much of a sim aspect here really but managing your money is a pretty concrete problem.

It's a cruel profession, a harsh master that cripples and kills men indiscriminately. It's about worth the $10 for a one and done, well worth more than that if you feel the bite and keep going. Replays to learn the best loadouts, weekly challenges, expert mode. You could easily break 10 hours trying to 100% this one.

Pro's
- Relaxing, quirky western music.
- Suitably cartoon-ish visuals and environments.
- Enjoyable game-play loop of mining oil.
- Very satisfying to earn lots of money on a single plot of land.
- Some nice additional mechanics like durable rocks and gas pockets vary the game a little.
- Fun characters.


Neutral
- Doesn't have a story, other than buying up share to become the next mayor.
- Some people might feel the game gets too repetitive by the end of a 9 hour play-through, whilst other will enjoy it.


Con's
- Normal mode is insanely easy once you get the hang of the game (I managed to buy over 85% of the town shares without trying very hard, when only 51% is needed to ""win"" the game). Conversely, the hard mode is a bit too difficult, with the AI earning ridiculous sums of money from terrible plots of land.
- Some of the equipment upgrades are either useless or not worth the cost (and yes I am talking about the damn moles).
- The last few plots of each of the four biomes are usually not fun to mine as they are very poor quality and pay barely any money.

You'll have strategic decisions to make. Upgrades you choose will have an impact on your gameplay.

It feels so polished and so structured and so fair and perfect and fun. At no point have I felt mad or frustrated or like the game was not correctly reflecting my intent of what I was trying to do. When I win, I know why I won, and when I lose, I know why I lost, and at every moment I feel like the game is doing exactly what I want it to be doing. At no moment do I feel like a situation is out of my control or unfair, and when things go badly I think to myself ""ok so that was a bad idea, I can learn from this"". 

The timing is perfect! It's great to jump in and kill 3 minutes during a brief downtime, it's great to kill 5 hours when I've got nothing to do. I can play this game exactly how and when I want. 

I have not encountered a single bug. There's a perfect amount of world building and character development through a very minimal amount of reading.

Now having said that, I would say that this game is a decent casual game to pickup and play in short bursts. The game itself is fairly easy and most of the in-game upgrades are not really needed once you get the hang of production so in one way this creates a no stress game. In another way, this game is fairly shallow and a bit boring. Thankfully, the game does offer a feature to speed up the game. 

Overall I think what made this game fun for me is very subjective and I understand why many people would not like it. I would only really recommend this game to people that are looking for a simple money management game that is quickly finished and does not offer too much in the way of gameplay variety. 

The bad parts of this game that I don't think anyone could argue with are as follows: the AI is dumb and doesn't pose much of a challenge,  the game is very repetitive with very little variety, the game is short and many of the in-game upgrades are not needed. On the hardest difficulty setting the game goes from too easy to ball-crushingly difficult as the AI accumulates huge sums of money and is always able to outbid you.

Despite these short comings, I found this game worth my time and money. The game isn't amazing but if you have an interest in money/resource management games and like the ""Western"" look I would recommend this game.

It's relaxing and hectical at once. The game offers a noticable learning curve where you go from poking in the earth to becoming a oil prince(ss). I had it on my wishlist for a while untill I saw it on a sale. The moment it came on sale I bought it and sat 4 hours straight learning the secret of oil. I have no regrets.

So what do you actually do in Turmoil?

The plot of the game is to compete against others in a oil rush. There's 4 maps you'll be competing in, where each map increases the difficulty with new ""resources"" & ""blockages"". To keep up with the competition you'll have to spend your profits wisely on upgrades in your town.

There's a big factor of decision making in the game. From what to buy, when to buy to where you wish to begin and where potential secrets are in your map. Each map makes you improve your strategy due to its difficulty which is a great feature as you feel you're continuously improving and theres no rinse & repeat feeling.

With that there's also a 2nd mode that unlocks new features and difficulty. Giving more value to your dollars and total playtime.

Pros & Cons

Due to the games learning curve you'll get a consistent feel of mastery. The competition part of the game is a interesting touch to the game and definitely motivates you to perform.

A downside is that the game is perhaps a little rushed. I didn't feel like I had the time to buy more features and ended up rushing my experience

the ng+ feature adds more life to the game. definitely worth a look at once you get there.

Conclusion. Should you buy Turmoil?

The first completion of the game lasts you anywhere from 5 to 6 hours, which almost hits you the ""1 dollar an hour"". However, if you wish to try out the ng+ mode you'll definitely get value for your dollar.

I personally sat 4 hours straight because I loved it so much. Its different to what I usually play and the change was appreciated.

What's interesting is that it never gets too complicated, is a difficult game to learn in the sense that it's difficult to develop strategies initially.

Mainly because the game locks you out of a lot of mechanics at the beginning of the campaign that it really shouldn't lock you out of.

Like the ability to speed up the game, this is a game that's in grave need of systems, that have become staples of the genre.

Speed controls, the ability to resell buildings, and/or units that you don't need.

Generally tho, if you stick with the game for a while, and get past the initial headache, you'll find a game that has a very pleasant look, and an addictive game play curve.

The game has a fairly long campaign, a quick mode of play, and I believe even multiplayer.

For example, sometimes a douser will identify an oil reservoir that you can't see because it is lower than the bottom of the screen. You can't scroll down to access this reservoir. For $25, the mayor will sell you a tip suggesting that you wait until later in the year to use that reservoir, because the screen automatically scrolls down slowly over the course of the year. This fact is not obvious until you see the paid tip. I can't think of any logical reason for this scrolling behavior.

Some features, like being able to repay a loan, are simply missing. This seems to be developer laziness, rather than some inexplicable balancing choice.

This game misses clicks. I find that sometimes I click on something three or four times without it registering. As a workaround, I have to hold down the left mouse button for about a quarter of a second. This presumably happens because the game uses polling for the mouse buttons instead of interrupts, as it should. Reconfiguring the frame rate from 30fps to 60fps seems to help. I can't understand why any game would limit itself to 30fps, or why anyone would do input polling in the same thread that renders the graphics.",1596776093,1596776651,False,0,0,0.478604346513748169,0,True,False,False

It's a very simple but very fun game where you dig for oil in a Wild West setting. 

To achieve that, you first use dousers to tell if there's oil, dig an oil rig, draw the pipes to the deposits and hire wagons to sell the oil. On each level you have a time limit and compete vs other oil tycoons.
Of course, the point is to turn a profit, and the oil prices fluctuate heavily during levels. You can choose when and how much you sell, or if you store it for when the prices rise.

In between levels you bid for plots of land against your competitors, and have a chance to improve your technology to retrieve oil faster, buy gizmos that boost your dousing/exploring ability or take a loan if you're in a tight spot.

It's an extremely simple game in terms of what you can actually do, but the gameplay can get frantic real fast.
The graphics are charming and the music, relaxing.

The good:
- good tutorial, introducing you to the mechanics, with a forgiving learning curve
- decent graphics and audio
- no bugs that I encountered
- there is an expert mode if you want more of a challenge

The not so good
- the gameplay is simple and not very challenging
- the limitation of only starting each level with a small amount of money no matter how much you actually had in the bank made each level start off slowly, and added tedium to an already repetitive game

I've played this game back in 2016 when it was released, and to be fully honest not much has changed.

Even though the game is technically still the same thing again and again, it's still somehow fun to play.
I've got addicted to it within 30 mins of gameplay.

Oil Oil Oil! So you have struck it rich and you need a new game to play. Turmoil is a Strategy Management Simulation, were you head ""out west"" I guess to drill for oil. Overall it works for all players, its very simple to play, and as you get better you start to ""master"" it more. My first go around took about 6-7 hours to play, overall its a fun simple game.
Overall I would recommend, even with one play-through (and I like the every dollar should be one hour of game play kind of model for what you buy), so for under 10$ its good, when on sale its even better!
Pros:
The game does a good job teaching you how to play
Its can get very fun when your trying to build 10 rigs and manage all your horses, and opps one of you wells is spilling oil!
Its a simple game that get more complex as you play

Cons:
The start is always the same and gets repetitive
At the end of the day you are doing to the same thing every ""mission"" even though you are getting better at it",1590337583,1590337583,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's relaxing and hectical at once. The game offers a noticable learning curve where you go from poking in the earth to becoming a oil prince(ss). I had it on my wishlist for a while untill I saw it on a sale. The moment it came on sale I bought it and sat 6 hours straight learning the secret of oil. I have no regrets.

[h1] So what do you actually do in Turmoil? [/h1]

The plot of the game is to compete against others in a oil rush. There's 4 maps you'll be competing in, where each map increases the difficulty with new ""resources"" & ""blockages"". To keep up with the competition you'll have to spend your profits wisely on upgrades in your town. 

There's a big factor of decision making in the game. From what to buy, when to buy to where you wish to begin and where potential secrets are in your map. Each map makes you improve your strategy due to its difficulty which is a great feature as you feel you're continuously improving and theres no rinse & repeat feeling. 

With that there's also a 2nd mode that unlocks new features and difficulty. Giving more value to your dollars and total playtime.

[h1] Pros & Cons [/h1]

[list]
    [*] Due to the games learning curve you'll get a consistent feel of mastery. The competition part of the game is a interesting touch to the game and definitely motivates you to perform.

    [*] A downside is that the game is perhaps a little rushed. I didn't feel like I had the time to buy more features and ended up rushing my experience

    [*] the ng+ feature adds more life to the game. definitely worth a look at once you get there.
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion. Should you buy Turmoil? [/h1]

The first completion of the game lasts you anywhere from 5 to 6 hours, which almost hits you the ""1 dollar an hour"". However, if you wish to try out the ng+ mode you'll definitely get value for your dollar.

I personally sat 6 hours straight because I loved it so much. Its different to what I usually play and the change was appreciated.

Each round is satisfying and engaging as you strive to get as much oil out of the ground as possible and sell it at the highest price.  In between rounds, you'll use your profits to buy upgrades for your oil extraction and storage tools and eventually shares.  Shares represent the win condition for the campaign as you seek to acquire a majority stake in the town to become mayor.   Strategy and challenge ramp up over the course of a campaign as you unlock new upgrades and oil becomes more difficult to extract.  Maximizing your profits and then spending them wisely will be the keys to success.  I found this dynamic to be fun and rewarding. 

Sound effects, music and art all accompany the gameplay nicely, definitely capturing a mood of the Old West about to turn New West.  UI works nicely and I did not encounter any bugs. 

The expansion for this game hones the gameplay and balance that saw some mechanics be a little underwhelming in the original campaign.  Definitely worth picking up if you enjoy the base game.  

Overall, I'd give this game a B, a solid game worth your time if it sounds interesting.",1590174233,1590174460,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do you want to know how people earn billions of dollars sucking the Earth dry of oil? This game won't explain that to you but at least you will stick some pipes into the ground and begin pumping that liquid gold.

The gameplay is pretty simple and for casual gaming you don't even need to use all the features and perks (in fact, it seems that quite a bunch of them are useless). During the main campaign even that small variety of levels is not that challenging and the strategy remains the same all the time, which makes it boring really fast.

Having learnt that being too bold can be fatal, I started being more careful in my second run. Im still in the third stage, but I can say I am improved more; balancing profit with stock share while keeping enough money for the next campaign.

Im glad this is a simulation lol. It is quite realistic. I can see from this game why business rivalries can be so fatal in real life. I can see better on how business works too in real life. Though that mechanics didn't really exist here; it seems all play quite fair.

I bought the game on sale for 2€ (~2.20$). I wasn't expecting much but I was looking for a small way to spend some time. I actually didn't believe what a great game I got there for 2€.

It is bug-free, has a great graphics-style and is overall nice to look at. The game has many features and brakes down complex economical principles (Storage-Cost-Calculations, investments in infrastructure, interest rates vs. ROI, basic stock trading) into an understandable, easily playable, fun experience.

If you're into strategy games, Management-Simulations or basically into economics / finance, this is the game to buy.

Another great feature: The developing company doesn't seem to be after the money only. They released the game when it was playable and bug-free, and kept developing.
I reaaaaally hope that they keep producing new features.

Only problem: The game rounds are too short sometimes as you could use more advanced strategies if you had more time. Also the maps can be a little small.
Another con: There is no Multiplayer.
Apart from this, perfect!

I enjoy games of digging for hidden resources, selling to volatile market economies, building upgrades with profits, and competing with AI competitors. I have a lot of fun trying to maximize every single dollar of profit.

The first half of the campaign has a similar level-townupgrade cycle, but then the game goes into natural gas and heating, where it loses points with me. Those game mechanisms are not well explained, unlike the excellent initial tutorial, and it is tricky to use them for profit. Struggling to get these mechanism working on each level adds a lot of stress to an otherwise relaxing game.

One biiiiig problem with the linux version is that the Daily Challenge does not work at all and sometimes crashes the game.

[list]
    [*]I enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere, the music sets the tone and the art makes you feel like you're in the 19'th century.
    [*]How it initially seemed like you were progressing gameplay wise after each dig.
[/list]

[u][b]What I Accepted:[/b][/u]
[list]
    [*]Upgrades are expensive, likely to last the entire campaign.
    [*]Upgrades aren't friendly, take the wrong one and you're screwed until the next 3-4 digs.
    [*]None of the characters get much of any development, they're there give reasons behind mechanics.
[/list]

[u][b]What I Despised:[/b][/u]
[list]
    [*]The gameplay [i]very[/i] quickly became repetitive.
    [*]The relaxing atmosphere is destroyed by how short each dig level is.
    [*]A relaxing atmosphere is complemented with a myriad of small tasks and unique obstacles in each dig level, otherwise it increases the intensity of one’s boredom.
    [*]The crux of the problem is how shallow the game actually is. There’s barely any content, and the upgrades are high in price to stretch the game length rather than to keep it interesting.
    [*]The only way to enjoy this game is to play one dig level each irl day in order to enter the perfect mental state for sleep, which isn’t the kind of game I expected from the videos.
    [*]It takes too long to afford all of the upgrades and as a result, it feels like you’re not progressing at a comfortable speed. The cheapest upgrade takes three dig levels to even approach the amount of money necessary to safely buy, and most of the upgrades are barely unique or interesting. Notice that this game has [i]four[/i] main areas—the longer to bore you with!

[h1]Conclusion & Rating[/h1]

This game is ironically not worth it's weight in oil (And I should know considering my location!). I would price it at $1.99 at most. It doesn't look like it took much effort, and there's not enough content to keep you entertained.

When you want to connect natural gas to a left or right company, you can't build from the company.  Worse part is, every youtube video out there they do this.  But, in the reality of the game, and the talk on the help information online, you still can't do that.  Instead you need to connect it from your existing pipes... all the while those pipes are connected to oil pockets and this just wont work.  I even had an abandond tower and pipe system set.... and the price didn't go anywhere for that company.

It has been years since this was brought up on youtube, here in steam, and other locations where players are giving suggestions and even the Dev's are posting.  Yet, no change.  My last save is  now stuck with a very expensive gas sell upgrade and no way to use it.

Your profits depend on an ever fluctuating sale price that jumps wildly throughout the timed drilling session.  The game attempts to throw in a few mechanics that are meant to make it more interesting, like running gas lines to an oil company in order to boost the oil price...  This doesn't make any sense to me, but heck its just a game.  

The whole thing plays out in the form of a competition between you and a handful of AI opponents.   There is no real plot, heck this is basically a glorified minigame.

Unfortunately once you get past the first chapter of the game you are hit with a new game mechanic that is just plain annoying: ""running for mayor"" by means of buying magical ""mayor stock"" in a competitive auction format.  Sorry devs but you really lost me here.  I can ignore the absurdity of buying stocks to become a mayor- it is just a goofy game- but what I cannot ignore is the fact that the game basically forces you to blow the majority of your earnings on acquiring a ""stock"" rather than buying upgrades that would actually make the game more enjoyable.  If you choose not to go along with this and actually spend your money on upgrades it will simply mean a game over screen sooner, rendering your upgrades useless.

Seriously, is there some sort of natural progression from oil prospector to government office that I am unaware of?  This whole thing seems to be pulled out of left field.  

Imagine that half way through witcher 3 you were suddenly informed that you needed to put the majority of your experience/ability points into a new special category labeled ""geologist.""  There is no way to beat the game without being fully specced as a geologist.  You will never be able to use any of the abilities or perks in this skill tree, but without it Siri and Yenifer will simply drop dead towards the end of the game due to some unexpected geological accident that doesn't quite fit into the story- an event that can only be thwarted by a geologist witcher.   

That is pretty much what this game does with its annoying mayor game mechanic.  It sucks the fun right out of the game.

It's honestly pretty fun to have to manage whether or not to sell and who to sell to based on the prices for oil at different companies, and the upgrades are pretty good as well. I can definitely say I recommend this game.

However, the wagon AI is [b]terrible[/b]. I've literally gotten spillages with [b]literally 40[/b] wagons and one rig with the pipe width boosted twice because the wagons don't care enough to stay near it or take any oil when it's almost at the top. This is the only reason I've had to get the timer upgrade, which extends the duration of time that a rig can be at full capacity before spilling.

If the wagon AI is improved slightly so that they're more aware of what rigs are producing the most oil, the game would be a bit more enjoyable, although it is very enjoyable already.",1581131683,1581131683,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In case you were wondering how to beat expert mode, you have to buy all the stock as soon as possible.
The AI are so much better than you that you can not hope to get enough money to buy them out at the end of the game. With this method you will have 50% stock near the end of the third area.

As for why I hate the game, it's the AI. 
(Also the game is repetitive and somewhat shallow, but you can beat normal and expert mode in around 20 hours so hopefully you will finish playing before you get sick of it.)
The AI do not make mistakes. Which means that in order to win, NO MISTAKES ALLOWED.
Did you find a gas pocket too late in the level ?
Did you have a slow start due to suboptimal pipe layout?
Did you have any spillage?
Did you make any mistake that cost you money?
Pause the game, stop the game from steam, then reopen the game from steam so you can try again.
If you do not retry a level you failed to optimize earnings, the AI will kick your butt so bad you will never catch up.
This makes an already repetitive game turn into a tedious grind to maximize earnings.

The base level of the game is relatively well refined.  The goal is to extract as much of the oil from a randomly generated map and sell it for the best price possible.  There are various tools and strategies that you will gain along the way that help you do this.  I won't say this is perfect because there are some flaws but generally this part of the game is fine and there is the option to play the game just like this in single level mode or the weekly challenge.

The next level of the game is a sort of tycoon sim/role play that takes place in an arcade style town.  This part is really terrible but you will only run into it in the campaign modes.  This allows you to develop technology that will help you extract more oil from each individual level.  Since this is the worst part of the game it also allows me to show how this part interferes with the base oil extraction part of the game.  For whatever reason many of the techs you research require a fee in the town to research and then again on each oil field you chose to use them in.  This makes sense in the real world where better tech may cost more.  The problem is apparently your oil tycoon only has enough room on his wagon to the oil field for $2000 each year.  So despite having money in the bank in the town, you can't actually afford to buy the upgrades until well into the year.  And to do that you probably had to sell your early gains for below market value or take out loans with obscene interest rates (again despite having thousands of dollars if not much more in the bank that you can't use for no reason other than the game says you can't).

So basically the reason the game is holding your money hostage is the third level of the game is a ""competition"" against 3 AI to buy 50% of the mayor's shares in the town (government corruption xD).  This part of the game randomly pops up about half way through the second stage (of 4) in the campaign.  Every year you have to bid on a random percent of the shares and whoever bids the most wins them.  At the end you need that 50% to win the game.  That's right the win condition for a game advertised as a oil tycoon sim is to literally buy your way into the mayorship of a town surrounded by land that you have spent the last however many years depleting of oil.

In the end I am rating this mediocre game a thumbs down because I felt the challenge of the game came from the artificial constraints imposed by the developers ($2000 to start each year, time limited for both drilling and selling the oil, the need to buy something completely useless to the rest of the game to ""win,"" among others).  The game is also very repetitive.  Each of the 4 areas have like 10 different rounds where you do literally the same thing but the map resources are randomly placed differently.  Despite giving the appearance that you should be able to optimize oil extraction, the constraints on time and money make it impossible to actually do this which adds to the frustration.",1576963041,1576963041,False,0,0,0.474452555179595947,0,True,False,False

A good casual management game. It's not insanely difficult but it's a challenge to perfect your gameplay. It can quickly become repetitive, there's room for improvement to make the gameplay less mundane overtime as quickly as it does, but it's a decent game in its category.

If there's any category that comes to mind that [b]greatly[/b] lacks quality games, it's Mining games.
The only one that pops to mind as being an absolute A+ in the genre is [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/269110/Super_Motherload/?snr=1_1056_ajaxgetfilteredrecommendations_&curator_clanid=29162366]Motherload[/url].
I was hoping that Turmoil would be another [b]great[/b] game in this genre, but it isn't. Don't get me wrong, it is a good game, hence the positive review, but it's not a genre-defining game, it's great for a single play-through, [i]maybe[/i] a second one, but after that it becomes very stale.

I would also like to point out that just because it becomes a bit repetitive for me doesn't mean it has no replay-ability for anyone. This game may just as easily clique with you and you may think it has great replay-ability, which is great!

[h1]Gameplay and Mechanics[/h1]

The point of the game, and pretty much the only thing you do is dig for oil and manage that oil in terms of storing it and when you should sell it as prices go up and down. This can quickly become hectic, you can easily miss small windows of opportunity to sell your oil for a good price if you don't pay attention, and if you don't sell your oil in time you will run out of storage space and it can go south very quickly.
Good difficulty level, great management game-design, it's simple and entertaining.

The game, in my humble opinion, doesn't have much replay-ability because it becomes repetitive too quickly.
Playing through the main campaign is fine, I obviously liked it, but I couldn't really play much more after that without getting bored.
The reason it becomes repetitive, or at least became repetitive for [i]me[/i] is because you don't do much other than the core mechanic of digging oil and managing the oil, there's not really any other mechanics involved to freshen things up, it kinda just lacks in complexity.

Between every level you can buy and upgrade equipment and gain some skills, kind of.

The game [i]technically[/i] has replay-ability, there are different difficulty levels and you can complete challenges/achievements.

In terms of difficulty: It is not insanely difficult as I already mentioned, but it can be a tough challenge to really perfect your way of playing it, to be on top in every level.


[h1]Ending Words[/h1]

I played it for about 11 hours, and for the price tag, especially during a sale is well worth it for 11 hours of entertainment if you like this type of game. There were no bugs, the gameplay was smooth and all-around enjoyable for about 11 hours.

If you're hungry for a game in this category, I recommend it. If you're a bit skeptical, consider picking it up during a sale.

Things I did not like especially and that ruined my impression:
- no idea on what land to bid on
- interest rates go way over 100% easily so one loan and you are screwed
- scanner use is paid extra (I thought it was something to get rid of those lazy bastards) and its range is very limited
- time constraints in missions allow you for not very much profit
- HUGE spillage fines, that ruined one of my first levels. I was not aware that there is a fine for that.
- limited starting money on every mission (why??). Out of all money you have, you only take 2k with you to actually build.
- horse management is non-existant. I sometimes bought extra horses just for them to stay there and wait, telling me nothing until I clicked where they should sell to.
- concept of silos and waiting for the proper price does not really work. You only gain what you sell at the end of the level, not what you have in silos.

When your dowser alerts you to a new source, you have to decide between spending the money to build a new rig or laying new pipe to get to the source. Then there is the logistics. Do you have enough money to store your oil in a silo and bring it to market at the highest prices or do you have to sell at a lower price to raise some quick cash? Do you even have enough resources to transport your oil and avoid paying spilling fines?

I don't remember the last time I was fooled so hard by a developer with bad intentions.
[b]EDIT:[/b] And if you see the developer comment, you'll notice how they completely ignored the complaint about their misguided marketing and changed the direction of the discussion. Now it's CLEAR it was intended misguided marketing.

You start the game: a Leaderboards right out of the bat, so you can compare you Digital P***s Size (commonly known as DPS) to other players.
Look the Settings menu to try and disable it? HA-HA. NO CHANCE.

Now, start campaign and select a player out of four. Remember the other 3? They are your computer opponents.

Ended drilling an area? Compare how you did to all 3 of them. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

Want to become the mayor? I hope you got the hang of the game, because EVERY SINGLE TIME before drilling, dispute in a F-king auction for shares.

Want to try a relaxing mode where you are just playing against yourself, trying to get the hang of things? YOU CAN'T.

If you are looking for a management game with a good mix of strategy, depth, a sprinkle of luck, and competitive sense, this is your game. Otherwise, hit the ""Ignore"" button. You won't miss anything of importance.

The game is good to a certain extend, but too expensive for the full price. 
Nothing wrong with the game itself and it is in fact fun. But it is a quite short one while The replay value almost doesn't exist, In fact - one wishes there would be some reason, but there is unfortunately none, maybe to perform better in a second run. But how far success goes depends on the luck and performance in the first 2-3 fields. The advantage in money and technology made there would stack up through the campaign.

What´s really missing is some other game modes - instead of something like that dlc -(a bad 5$ dlc for an overpriced 5$ title?). There were plenty options for different game modes while keeping the concept. For instance an VS. mode as action party pvp on the same map location (maybe split-srceen) - where you need to dig faster and perform better in redirection oil to the vendors or use the gas in the very right  second. 

The concept itself is cool and if the graphic doesn't bother you - this one promises fun - for some time... it is enjoyable and it seems to be bug-free.. no issues found afik. 

It is a deal on sale- for 5 up to 10 euro or dollar but dont expect to play it for something like weeks. It would be hours, maybe some afternoon in between. 

My game counter is now 40 hours and thus only as several people played it here.   Overall the game has to get a good review but remind the steep price tag .

Unfortunately the implementation is quite lacking. Gameplay is very shallow and repetitive and the UI sometimes annoying. There are many strange design decisions which ultimately drained all the fun out of the experience for me. Personally, I wouldn't even buy it on sale, although the price seems fair.

[u]In long:[/u] The basic [b][u]gameplay[/u][/b] revolves around drilling for oil. Each level is a 2D slice through the ground. Prospectors indicate oil deposits so you can place your oil rigs and drag straight lines to drill into the ground. Once you hit an oil deposit it will be slowly pumped up where you pick it up with horse wagons and store it for later or sell it.
Several limitations provide a challenge: Levels generally last for 12 months before they automatically end (about 10 minutes of real time). During this period the level slowly scrolls upwards, revealing deeper parts. Each level starts you with a limited budget of $2,000 and literally every action costs money. There is limited space above ground and sometimes rocks inhibit drilling
There are a lot of different [b][u]mechanics[/u][/b] at play, especially in the campaign mode meta-layer visualized as an old-timey Western town. Buy promising plots in land auctions, spend profits on gear upgrades, bribe officials for bonuses on the next level. Once in the level you need to prospect, drill, and manage space, time and cost at the same time. The main economic mechanic is bound to the constantly fluctuating sell prices at two refineries. Sell now so you can invest or store for later to make a bigger profit? On later levels you can find diamonds (may extend playtime on a level or reveal good plots) or gas deposits (can temporarily boost prices). Bonus cash is handed out for draining every deposit and for finishing early. Finally the over-all goal of the campaign is to own a majority stake in the town, which you can pick up during share auctions.

Sounds promising, doesn't it? Unfortunately the actual gameplay is [b][u]shallow and flawed[/u][/b] in many ways:
My biggest gripe by far is how [u]repetitive[/u] the game is. Apart from the introduction of rocks and gas halfway through the campaign of 40 levels, you're essentially replaying the same level over and over again. The campaign is pretty much just a framework for a level generator. Don't get me wrong, level generators are always welcome, but here it leads to every level feeling the same. Limitations of money and space make you stick to the same build order and building layouts.
The [u]scaling and progression[/u] are way off. All the many upgrades and cool mechanics have little impact for most of your playtime. Each level starts with the same amount of money, which is usually enough for only one rig. There is no way to accelerate the early game, so you have to suffer through it dozens of times, never giving you a satisfying feeling of having outgrown your early days as a small oil driller. There are no passive production boosts at all - first you pay to unlock an upgrade, then you pay to have it installed each level. Example: Unlocking drill speed does not make drilling faster unless you pay an additional $500 on each individual drilling rig. Often you don't end up buying the upgrades at all. Once you can afford them, they're often not cost effective anymore for the limited time remaining. Levels don't even get larger or more intricate. They always scroll up at the same excuciatingly slow speed, so finishing early sometimes risks missing a tiny pocked of oil at the very bottom, which kills your full-clear bonus. Said bonus is also sometimes denied by the wonky liquid physics - tiny amounts of oil and gas in the same pipe can take months to clear out for some reason.
The impact of [u]randomness[/u] is too big for my taste. Levels vary wildly in the amount and accessibility of oil deposits and how good of a level you're going to get is essentially random for most of the game. Sometimes prospectors ignore giant oil deposits near the surface and instead indicate tiny bubbles underneath rock. The random level generation is good for replayability, but can also completely shut you out with rocks. All the auctions are essentially random as to where and how heavily the AI will bid. There's also a wide range between incredibly useful and utterly useless NPCs who show up at the saloon to offer one-time bonuses for the next level.
The AI is pretty competitive unless you know exactly what you're doing, so the game clearly expects a degree of [u]optimization[/u] by the player. But it doesn't give you the proper tools to do so. There's a prominently displayed price per unit of oil, but you'll never see an actual amount anywhere. How much oil fits in a wagon or a silo? Will the capacity upgrade pay off or should I just sell overflow? How much is left in the deposit and what is the through-put of my level 2 pipes? You can painstakingly reverse-engineer ratios and rough estimates, but frustratingly the game expects you to optimize your business on guesswork.

Unfortunately the problems don't stop with gameplay and extend into the [b][u]user interface[/u][/b]: Inbetween almost every level of the campaign two auctions (land and stock) take place. The game will not let you advance without completing them, which takes at least 6 clicks through 2 different interfaces per auction, not to speak of watching ""riveting"" AI bid-wars for several seconds. If they are mandatory, please just streamline the process. Reminder pop-ups without shortcuts are just annoying. Speaking of the stock auction - what a terrible concept! It's a kind of Dutch auctions where a huge wheel visualizes the price ticking down. It's partly a reaction game, but it boils down to gambling, as the AI is essentially bidding randomly. It always starts with the highest networth, so if someone has loads of cash, you're watching for 10 seconds before the price is even remotely competitive. The devs probably know how terrible it is, since one of the paid DLC features is an alternate stock auction. Not sure why they feel fixing the main game should cost money.
A few minor UI gripes: The tutorial about many essential mechanics only unlocks several levels in and each explanation costs in-game money (admittedly a tiny amount, but the concept is ridiculous). The very helpful prospector NPC just vanishes once you buy a plot, leaving me wondering where he was for most of the game as I always bought plots before visiting the saloon. It's also probably not the smartest move to have click-drag from a valve be drilling and clicking on a valve be toggling it for $150. More than once I misclicked my first drill, costing me $300 of my $2,000 starting funds.

In terms of [b][u]technical aspects[/u][/b] the game gets passing marks. The menu features separate volume sliders and many language options, but just a few pre-definied resolutions (they're sensible though). Windowed mode works well. Concerning the [b][u]audio-visiual experience[/u][/b] the music is decent. The sound effects are generally passable, with a few slightly jarring exceptions. It's a bit plain, but I actually like the visual style of the game.

Fair disclaimer: I do not own the DLC and have not played the expert mode campaign. They may very well address a few of my gripes. But in [b][u]conclusion[/u][/b] I found Turmoil to be way too tedious and repetitive. The game has a great atmosphere and theme, but does very little with it. It's neither a simulation, nor an arcade game. Because of the small amount of unique content and the many design flaws the game ended up frustrating me more than entertaining me. I would never pay full price for it. At 50% off on sale your milage may vary, but I frankly enjoyed myself too little to justify even that more sensible price tag.",1542933204,1542933204,False,285,37,0.671787679195404053,28,True,False,False

Graphic design, even if being simple, is very representatvive of what I had in mind about the oil rush in the United States during the Wild West in the 19th century. 
The different actions to do during the game, once again even if it seems simple in apparence, are also very representative of what I had in mind regarding the management of petrol fields exploitation and towns during the Wild West.
In campaign mode, which is what I started the game with, years of petrol exploitation appear like ""moving paintings"" and are not too long (it is even speed possible to speed them when necessary). 
With the help of automatic saves between each ""painting"" (I thought of each year as a painting since the game automatically provides you with a screen capture at the end of a year when giving you results and charts), I can play Turmoil just the way I want it, depending on the time I have for playing:
- a few ""paintings""/years for my immediate enjoyment, and then I go and do something else, 
- or a big rush till the end of the campaign when I am in a mood to always do better than the previous year; the game can really become addictive, especially when I feel that it is one of my good days!
Of course, since it is a construction and management simulation, it could quickly become annoying. However, each campaign appears to be really different to me because if each petrol fields are randomly created at the beginning of a ""painting"", there are so many ways to break through difficulties for exploiting them with less or more costs that it is always a challenge for me to try to do better than before.  
At last, I can add that the music does help me to have a good immersive experience each time I play Turmoil. If it is of course in a western style, there are enough different soundtracks played depending on actions being done that it really breaks the monotony which could occur for me with such kind of games.",1540123847,1540123847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While this game does provide quite a challenge for someone who is not used to this game, it gets very easy toward the end if you have saved up a lot of money. The AI competitors are, in all honestly, are useless. I played through the entire game (minus some of those last levels) and I never once got less money in one haul than my competitors.

The games design is incredible, the very cartoony style really cimpliments the year 2016 when it was released, and it compliments really well the time of the game and when the story takes place. The characters are unique and and depending on the DLC and the mode that you are playing (Expert vs Campaign) the extra little superpower part is very unique.

Personaly I was crying at the end of the game when I have reached over 50% stocks and finished off the BONUS ISLAND. The Expert Mode brings quite a lot of challenge to the players yet it is NOT impossible as some people say. 

""The Heat Is On"" DLC is worth every peny and brings a completely new style of play to the game. A thing to note that it is too challenging to beat THIO DLC on expert mode, yet still possible. 

To sum it up, the game is very worth the money and looks stunning. The gameplay is amazing and anyone who is thinking of buying it, just do it, and don't forget to buy the ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK and the DLC!

Three years late to game and possessing faint memories of a gameplay video I watched way back when, it is finally time to make a name for myself in the oil business. We all missed the oil rush, but with Turmoil you can relive that period of time and cash in with that liquid gold.

After hearing how much oil the ground can hold, you come to the very town that happens to be surrounded by many plots of land holding oil. However, you are not the only oil entrepreneur that heard about this and decided to travel to this town. Three others will compete alongside you to make the most out of this opportunity. Once you pick your desired character, arrive in town with your starter money, and receive the mayor’s gift of a free plot of land, you are ready to get drillin’.

Turmoil’s gameplay is simple, but difficult to master. Before you set out to bring the oil up to the surface, you must get the land with it, and to get that you must have the lease. This section is called the land auction and everyone has a chance at winning land while also outbidding others. As everyone continues to drill oil, the land already purchased will show their oil yields and suggests that the land around them will also yield around that amount. Would you risk outbidding a competitor or go for a different one?

Apart from the first two warm-up rounds, each land lease lasts a year so you only have a finite time to bring up the oil. On top of this, you can only take $2,000 with you. So first things first, finding the oil. Dowsers are the first available source of locating oil (later on you can get moles and scanners), and possibly the most often used, but will not show where exactly it is, just that it will be under them. You can then build a rig, drill down until it hits a pocket of oil or misses it entirely as you drill back up, and buy a horse that can transport the oil.

Where do you sell the oil to make a profit while also being able to buy more resources? Well, two companies, Left Inc. and Right Inc. which are located on their respected sides, will compete for your business. Both Left and Right Inc. will fluctuate in their prices as time goes on and if you sell oil to them consecutively. To get the most out of the oil, you need to keep an eye on these prices. If you sell too much to one company, you might find yourself embarrassingly selling oil for 49 cents, but if you wait too long the high price will stop increasing.

Despite how easy this may seem, a lot is up to strategy. As you drill for oil, your rigs can easily turn on you if you’re not paying attention to them. If too much oil is not being shifted to the horses, the rigs will get blocked up and eventually spill. This will give you a hefty spillage fee by the end of the year if you react too slowly. The Left and Right Inc. might also not be in your favor as no prices live up to your taste, or perhaps you’re waiting to use the gas to your advantage, at that moment. To avoid spillage, you can set down silos to store the oil till the price is right. Make sure to keep storage space open so horses can keep storing it, but keep an eye on the date, as December can quickly sneak up to you as you wait to sell. It can quickly turn into a race to sell everything before you are forced to leave all that oil in the silos dashing all their hopes and dreams of being sold.

At the end of the year, you will get statistics on how it went like your spending and profit. There are also bonuses that you can get to earn extra money. You will get bonuses for depleting all the oil, selling all the oil, depleting all the gas, and closing your lease early (which will also net you a lease payback). So if you find yourself finished before the year is up, no need to wait it out.

The town isn’t just for show, but also hold valuable resources once you get back every year. There are shops that offer upgrades to help you while you drill oil which can range from upgrading existing equipment to make them more efficient to giving you a whole new equipment (which will also have upgrades to make them more effective). This new equipment provides other ways to reveal oil pockets, which are moles, who randomly reveal tiles, and scanners, which automatically reveal whatever is in the scanner circle. More upgrades are added as you get to a new area that will have a different conditions. Such as an area having rocks that require you to upgrade your drill if you want to drill through them or needing moles and a specific upgrade to pick up diamonds if they show up by chance. You also have Daphne’s, which is a saloon where you talk to various people that you can... generously donate money to as they return a favor. These offers can get Left or Right Inc. to not go under a certain price, give you a discount on spillage fees, or even lower interest rates. If you find yourself low on cash, the bank can also give you a loan, but you have to pay them back by the end of the year no matter how big of a loan you take out.

Around half way through, an interesting prospect turns up as the winning condition is revealed. The mayor is selling the town stocks Dutch auction style and whoever has 50% will become the new mayor. All you have to do is watch the price go down to either you press the buy button or your competitor does. Those who have less than 50% will be kicked out of town (if no one has 50%, whoever has less gets kicked out and their shares will be auctioned till someone does), and if that’s you, well, you lost the campaign. This is really the only aspect of Turmoil that I disliked as I found this too random. The AI can pay more for a share that was less than the last round or outright use all of their money immediately. The only hope is to keep your money above the AI and go to land auctions first in hopes that they spend their money on upgrades before the stock auction.

If you do become mayor, there is a special plot of land that the old mayor will point you towards. Giving you a nice, and hectic, end to a campaign.

The Heat is On DLC review 

Verdict

Turmoil may be simple, but it holds an addicting management sim that requires you to be strategic to get the most profit out of each land lease. A lot of thought went into how to make drilling oil more than that through the many ways you can go about it, how the areas differ other than the background, and the upgrades you choose to pick up. While also having you manage your money in a way that you can gain a profit during a land lease and later afford auctions. If you so choose, replayability is high as each campaign varies due to plots being randomly generated, ability take part in weekly challenges and being able to generate single levels by seeds. I really had fun as I relaxed, occasionally freaked out over oil spilling, and thinking of ways to get more and more profit than my other competitors.",1530213920,1530537510,True,2,0,0.357173442840576172,0,True,False,False

[b] [u] Review: [/u] [/b]

[list]
 [*]Gameplay
     The main goal of the game is to buy land, pieces of land, hoping to get the piece with the most oil/gas/minerals from an auction done before each level. You are trying to outbid the game's AI characters or making them over bid for a piece of land. After you buy land you get in for a limited time in which you have to extract most if not all of the oil and other diamonds you may find in some levels. After that you go to the town and buy upgrades for your equipment, keeping in mind to leave enough money to buy land in the next round. This is basically the whole game.
 [*]Graphics
    The graphics are nice, the animations smooth. The portraits show enough to tell the characters appart without going in too much details. 
 [*]Sound/Music
    A nice soundtrack though after some time it grew repetitive and somewhat annoying. Sound effects are exaclty what you'd expect, not too much but not too little either.
 [*]Story
     There is no story in the game. There are dialogs with some characters in the game's town
 [*]Replay value
     There is not much, for me at least. I think it's a nice game, but there is not enough content in the game to make you come back and play it time after time for hours.
 [*]Price
     Full price of 10 euro not worth it for me. It is kind of overpriced for the amount of content and replayability it offers. There are a lot of good games out there you can get with half of that. Even with a 50% off I find it kinda too much given that in an hour or so you would know everything there is to know and have unlocked almost anything there is to unlock.
[/list]

[b]Overall[/b]
I found the game nice and amusing, but after an hour or so I found it too be too repetitive for me. I actually refunded the game with a heavy heart, being an Indie game. I'm sorry for the bad things I wrote about the game but even bad comments are constructive to help the Developer become better with each released game.

One major complaint however...

I noticed, while in fullscreen, there is a SERIOUS flicker - like it disagrees with my crossfire setup

Also, because of the flicker, the game allows me to see through the ground, so I can find all the oil ahead of time.

Obviously this is a problem that needs to be fixed, but then it got worse: while playing in fullscreen and trying to find the extent of this issue, the game crashed. No big deal, right? Unfortunely, wrong. Now, my computer has a *permanent* flicker that I cannot seem to get rid of. In addition to this, the in-game cursor is seemingly burned into my screen, near the top left corner.

Devs, please, what did this game do to my pc? The flicker won't go away! Send Help!

TL;DR 10/10 if you don't have crossfire

UPDATE: it eventually went away, but definately gave me a scare. Anyhow, played through the first campaign, highly recommend - Devs, multiplayer? PLEASE?",1527367629,1527575410,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I went into this game with the wrong expectations I think and therefore just didn't enjoy it very much, the game is pretty good but maybe it just doesn't resonate with me. For what you get, the price is about right.

So I went into this expecting a lot more than what was actually in it, maybe different types of drills, different types of oil or some kind of oil processing element with some crazy upgrades. I thought there would be more parts to this game. However, what happens is the following:

1. Find Oil using either dude/mole/scanner
2. Put pump above oil and drill down to oil
3. Buy a few horses, direct them to the company with the best price
4. Wait

Then you just do that, again and again and again... Once you've got the initial setup going with 2 or 3 oil pumps, you usually just sit around not doing very much until the game ends. I found myself setting things up and then just holding down the 'x' key for speeding the game up until the year ends. It's fun, for like the first 5 or 6 times you do it, and then there's not really much else and it gets a bit stale. 

Also, for me a lot of the upgrades felt a bit 'eh', I bought bigger pipes because that seemed pretty obvious for more cash, but I couldn't even notice any difference to my pipes when I then tested it out. The game introduces rocks to make mining harder too, this however didn't make it more fun or add much to the game, it just meant I then had to burn a load of cash at the shop to ignore the rocks... I then bought better horses to move oil faster, turns out that even though you payed tonnes for the upgrade, you still need to pay a big chunk of money every time you then want to use them.

Meh, the game was alright. It got repetitive pretty quickly and even owning the DLC didn't interest me in playing more of it. Feels like it could be an awesome flash game, but a bit lacking for a full title release.",1522701837,1522701952,False,5,0,0.569541454315185547,0,True,False,False

I wanted to wait until I got through the standard DLC Mode before reviewing. TLDR It is definiately a game worth the price and then some. Has very little replay value if you are Really good Really fast. It took me a few times to get through the base game expert mode.

As for the DLC, I think it was fun, though there were a few times I found the magma to be unnecessary. So really I treated it as another map to play rather than using the new tools. Also the slang used by the characters while bidding whether on land or on stock was so cringey, (Words like 'omergersh' is used). Which is what really shows the devs had fun with this :)

Aside from that I had technical issues with The Heat is On but never with the basegame. The cursor sikipped frequently and the begining of each year was lagging horribly, but ultimately it was not game breaking or hindering for me, more of an annoyance than anything.

You have to use this method in hard mode to beat the computer players (although easy is such a joke you don't have to). The system is so complicated on how to use gas, however, that it's not fun and does not function well.

In each level, you find and dig up oil and try to get the best price for it.

It's all set old-timey USA, and it's all surprisingly non-industrial, for oil mining. Oil is located either by men with divining rods (sticks) or trained moles (as in, the animal). Or, magical scanning things. It is easily and cleanly drilled using pipes (sometimes with the help of gas to speed it up). Oil is transported by horse-drawn cart, the skies are always blue, the fields are always green. The music always acoustic.

The only nod to environmentalism in this game is... you get a hefty fine if you spill oil, from mining it quicker than your little horses can cart away.

All a pleasant dream, very much removed from reality. But that's ok, because it's just the setting for a light-hearted game.

It's a good strategic game, where you manage oil extraction. You play each individual level, where you plop down rigs, silos and pipes. You decide when and which company to sell oil to, based on prices. You must decide when to strategically raise the prices during a level through natural gas. 
Once you finish a level, you return to the campaign overview, where you make your way through different drilling areas, purchase upgrades that make your oil drigging outfit more efficient, bid on land and later in the game, town stocks.

Good decisions that result in good profits roll over to the campaign mode and allow you to purchase upgrades before your competition. Know how to play, and you can slowly snowball into a surefire victory towards the end of the campaign.
It's satisfying that way, knowing your actions have put you in a good position towards the end. 
The gameplay is deep and strategic.

The game has replayability. Once you finish the campaign once, characters gain abilities, and you can have a go at it again. Each level is different, and each campaign will play out differently.
The campaign doesn't grow stale thanks to the fact that the game introduces more mechanics over the course of 4 different areas. Upgrades, rocks that you must drill around and gas.

The art style is unique and well done. It has it's own unique flair to it.

Overall, a fantastic game for it's price if you pick it up on sale like I did. Might be worth buying too if you're swimming in money like if you were an oil tycoon in Turmoil. For 18 hours of play so far, I've spent 0.111 cents an hour on this game.

A ravenous earthly shower befalls you, inching away at both your sanity and your health. With blues skies above you and the satisfying crunch of rock and dirt beneath, you raise your pick and get hunting. Not for gems, of course, those are frivolties for a higher class, one you don’t count yourself apart of. . . yet. Instead you hunt for gold, but not of the metallic variety, instead for that which is ebony in color and liquid in form. Oil. Black gold. Whatever you call it, you know that upon your timely return to town it’s going to buy you everything you could possibly desire and more. Except in Turmoil, you don’t play as the basic laborer slaving away day after day for naught but pennies on the dollar: you play as his boss. Turmoil is a weird game for me to categorize because it’s definitely management, but not management of people. You oversee the creation and workings of various oil pumps and that which flows so freely out of them; while yes that does mean you’ll be managing people, that isn’t really what Turmoil is about. It’s more about the hunt for oil itself, which is an idea that I thought would prove too shallow to make a game, at least when I initially began. However, they really utilized the idea in all its forms and facets, making for a game that still isn’t too deep, but regardless stands much less shallow than I expected. There’s a rather humorous bit of irony to be found in a game entirely focused on digging that stands shallow in gameplay. Regardless of that, I still think that the devs managed to flesh it out as much as can be done, which is admirable whether they’re a small studio or not. The key mechanics of the game are so enjoyable that it doesn’t matter near as much that they actually have much more. Not to say a content drought, pardon the pun, is a good thing, but it’s pushed out of focus by the extremely fun main mechanics. And those mechanics are extremely satisfying, managing your own little oil tycoon and slowly pushing all your competitors out of town and straight to hell. It does get old though, not very quickly but it gets old all the same, which is why I found myself playing for only a few hour long bursts. Turmoil is a game that you can just throw on, mute the audio, and listen to your favorite podcast or youtube channel while you slowly drain the earth of oil, drop by drop.

There’s literally no story here, other than that you’re an exorbitantly rich guy looking to become exponentially richer through the excavation and wholesale selling of sweet sweet oil. I’m glad they didn’t opt for some weird story, forcefully shoveled into your face like a parent trying to force their kid to eat veggies, because it puts the focus entirely on the gameplay. Thankfully that’s a good thing, because the gameplay is both organic and extremely fun. It’s mainly centered around two things: discovering where the oil is, and getting it out of the ground and flowing into your pockets. The former can be surprisingly difficult, because the oil randomly spawns depending on the rating of the land you purchased. Yes, you need to actually purchase the land through entertaining little auctions while you’re in town. These typically involve you picking a lucrative piece of land, and then promptly watching the three AI competitors scramble to steal it from you, driving the price up rapidly in the process. Later in the game you enter into auctions for a percentage of town stock, slowly but surely buying up the town, in the most literal sense. I absolutely love these little mini-feuds between the characters, because they start to get extremely personal; resulting in you forming rivalries and bonds of hatred with the others. I had to take a step back and just laugh at myself when I started yelling at Ricardo because the bastard had yet again stolen 4% of the stock right out from under me. These little rivalries are extremely fun not only because they make the game more personal, but also because they create an organic sense of fun that’s never the same as before. The gameplay does that as well, and I love how difficult they made it to actually find the oil, much less to dig it all up and get it to market. Because of that, you actually need to use all of the different additional side items, as opposed to just being able to wing it and guess where the oil’s at. These little side items, like a mole that digs up tiny spots of dirt or a sonar scan that clears a massive circle of dirt, make the discovering experience significantly more fun. That’s a good thing because without it you would just be doing the same three actions over and over again; get a dowser to find the oil, set up pumps and wells, then transport it all to market. Instead you still end up doing those three things, but you do them in fun little ways. Yes, you’re still just finding oil, but you’re doing it with moles and sonar scans as opposed to just throwing down a dowser and waiting for the results. I’m sure I’m repeating myself, but I can’t emphasize enough that while you are in essence doing the exact same thing every time, the different ways in which you can do it make for gameplay that doesn’t get old.

It's never been this cheap nor this fun to bludgeon your enemies to death with the righteous baton of capitalism, worth your money and your oil.

Gameplay-wise, it's just using your mouse to hire a dowser to find the oil, build your oil wells, drill down to the oil, build silos and get wagons to transport the oil to the refineries. You look at the price that the refinery is offering you and you decide if you wish to sell your oil by clicking on the arrows. If you don't want to sell your oil, you can store the oil in a silo and wait for the right price. But beware, if you don't collect the oil in a timely manner, your oil well can spillover due to the pressure. You can also buy upgrades for recovering the oil faster, storing more oil and scanning for the oil. You can also take loans and bid for land plots to drill for more oil.

Conclusion, I'm not really sure if this is doing it for me but I really don't enjoy the ridiculousness of this game. It might be some guesswork but in reality there are a lot of scientific methods for finding oil, like studying the age of the rocks at different depths (geology) and coring. The dowsing and moles are kind of a WTF moment for me.

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. It's Simple to Pick Up
It's like Cookie Clicker but you only need to click when to sell your oil.

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. Mysticism for Finding Oil
Dowsing to find oil was pushing it. When I saw the mole used to dig underground, I just got severely turned off.

2. Boring Gameplay

You play against 3 AI oil tycoons. The aim is to make money and eventually become the Mayor of the town. The game is split into two phases. 

The town phase sees you purchase and upgrade your equipment, sell diamonds, gain advantages by talking with saloon patrons, buy shares and select the next parcel of land to drill on. 

The mining phase has you explore your land and drill for oil, gas and rare diamonds. You can do this in several different ways. Using humans, animal, electronics or even pot luck. As you collect oil you either need to store it or sell to one of two companies. This phase lasts between 3-12 months (usually 12) and you must sell your oil before the end of the phase.  Each block of land is random so finding the oil is different each time.

However there are some cons you start noticing later in the game.

- You buy upgrades but most of them still require you to purchase the upgrade during each 'level' while drilling for oil. Everything is so expensive it's basically not worth it in the actual levels themselves unless you come across a very large store of oil and need to drill through rock or increase the pipe flow. I would much prefer that those upgrades are permanent additions like with the Dowsers. It would increase replayability since you could choose different upgrade paths along the way.

- More to the point above the NPCs don't seem to buy any upgrades so despite them sometimes making 5k or under in profit per level they always have stacks of cash to blow at the share auction. I'm currently halfway through the last zone and I've seen an NPC purchase one upgrade which was the drill. Maybe they do purchase upgrades, and I've just been missing it. They just always end up having way more cash despite making way less profit consistently.

- Not enough micro-management - when the price of oil increases at Left or Right you want to sell as much of your oil as quickly as possible yet selling carts will go empty an oil rig and go to sell with a nearly empty cart instead of filling it from a silo, or emptying a rig and then filling at a silo. It gets frustrating at the end of every year when you have so many carts going to sell barely any oil and you end up with an entire upgraded silo of unsold oil.",1514614479,1514614479,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+having multiple save games.  Currently there are no saves other than the autosave back at town
+The stock market seems like a tacked on victory condition.  It's an incredibly annoying system.
+penalties for spillage are far too severe.  At the very least there should be options for reducing the penalty, it's not enough that you're already losing oil to the ground that you need to be losing thousands in profit?  This was set in the 19th century, there was no greenpeace-  who's fining me $8000 for a bit of spill!?!
+Allowing mod support (even if it's just an ini file to change variables such as SPILL penalties).

I remember playing Wildcatter a thousand years ago and having a great time, and this gave me a similar feeling.  It's not horribly difficult but does involve a good bit of hands on and paying attention to be successful.  This fits in that special genre of games to pass the time but also give you just enough of a challenge to ensure you also lose track of time.   

Turmoil is a cohesive and seemingly bug free experience that was worth the dicsounted price from the Steam sale, but given its somewhat limited replayability, probably not worth a whole lot more.  It's basically everything I can expect (and maybe a little more) from any low budget indie game.

Pros:
-Simple, but requires strategy and some money-management. Unless you want to repay the high-interest loans of the bank!
-Easy to play, enough trial and error to keep the game fun.
-Replayability: Honestly, after I beat the campaign, which took about 7 hours, you could play it again on a more difficult mode, with every character having a special ability to help balance out the difficulty.

Cons: 
-Purchasing Stock: Slight spoilers, this makes the game a bit more difficult. However, you can just simply quit and reload until you get a decent price.
-Price: I bought this on sale for 55% off for $4.49. That is a fair price. The normal price is $9.99 which is a bit steep IMHO.

Grab this during a sale. It is relaxing, and fun!",1514466425,1514466425,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bid on a parcel of land, buy your upgrades and get out there and dig for oil! The gameplay is simple and reasonably addictive, forming a mixture of careful management, guesswork and calculating risk. You send out your dowsers to look for oil in the depths of the earth. Plonk your rig where you reckon the good stuff is, and send down a pipe. But oil isn't always easy to find. Sometimes its sunk deep, or behind a partial barrier of rock. That's where the trained mole comes in, diving joyously into the earth and uncovering little bits of the map beneath you. Once you've started tapping the sweet black gold you better get some wagons moving to the buyer's depot. Better be careful though, if the oil spurts up too thick and fast you'll get fines for spillage. Or the market might crash, forcing you to store the product in silos until prices recover. It's a neat little balancing act, but never too frantic. 

In between digging for oil you get returned to town to buy upgrades, grease the palms of the odd helpful official and bid for shares in becoming mayor. All good clean fun. Except oil isn't clean. It's a filthy business.

This game is good for one more turn shennanigans. However, after completing it a couple of times I can imagine you won't want to return to it for a long time. There's not overly much to it. But that's fine. The price fits the amount of gameplay you'll find in this package. I imagine you'll get a good ten hours out of it, not bad for seven pounds or so. 

Any flaws? Well, it could do with a little more personality when it comes to your rivals. You don't really feel any comedy antagonism against them. They just say a few ho-hum stock phrases and politely try to outdo you. You never feel like you're in too much competition against anyone. Which is a shame. The odd pop up bit of dialogue between missions with them twirling their moustaches or brandishing their parasols at you might be amusing. The game could also do with some random events or periodic temporary mechanics to keep things from getting stale. Perhaps subsidence knocking out oil-rigs for a time until they can be shored back up. A passel of free-herders running cattle across the map. A travelling snake oil merchant giving your crew a little mystery bottle of 'pep' to move their horses faster.
  
But all in all Turmoil is a perfectly fine game. Nothing earth-shaking but good fun for a few idle evenings of play. It's the definition of a good 'seven out of ten' game, one I can cheerfully recommend.

The biggest negative is the fact that you have no clue from the douser (the guy with the piece of wood) how deep you need to drill, so you need to build your pipes in stages which costs you valuable time. It would be awesome if the douser gave you an aproximate drilling depth.

Problems:
• The AI doesn't choose the shortest route to fulfill their goal and will walk past oil rigs that are about to spill even when they are carrying nothing.
• Dowsers with maximum depth also walk off the screen when there are large oil pockets left.
• The game freezes and crashes windows explorer when you leave the game.
• Once you get into the 4th region things start to break:
- When you buy stocks, even though you press buy - somebody else will buy and claim them at the price you chose, meaning that you need to have more than 50% of the stocks before going into the last region.
- The new upgrades to make gas pockets grow do not appear.

Each round has you buying land in an auction and then spending a season producing oil on that land.  Between rounds, you can upgrade elements to help you find and drill the oil more efficiently.  The oil wells are always randomized, and the drilling aspect is kind of clever.  The more you drill, the more information it reveals about the size of the well, but the more money you'll spend.  Placement between the two companies that buy your oil can affect how quickly you can sell it.   Suddenly Left is offering $2.00 a barrel, but your derricks are on the right.  So there's a little time management going on too.   The game is cleverly balanced, and a lot of fun.  Definitely worth the $10.

https://www.facebook.com/Kayasarcade/

I was actually going to buy a Humble Bundle only because I wanted this game so bad - Unfortunately I was 2 mins too slow, and the bundle was down, while trying to purchase it. 
Instead I got it on my steam wishlist, and decided to wait for it to go on sale - like an good adult. 

But I suck at being an adult, so I bought it a week later (full price), because I couldn't forget about this awesome game.
Lets just say, it was worth it. Gamious did a great job.

I already completed the game twice (Normal and expert), in 3 days. And I'm sure that I'm gotta complete it again.
It's (yet another) chill, relaxing, management game. It has some 'puzzle' elements in finding oil and strategy in choosing how to spend your money and what land to buy each level - I like that the 'management' part depends on how good and efficient you get though each level.

It has a lot of similarities with the old browser game 'Gold Miner' (If anyone else remember that game) - And that was what sold it for me, when I saw it the first time. 
It's so much more, tho - And I didn't at all feel like playing a game that I already had played before.

Give Turmoil some love, its an amazing game!",1494141567,1494141567,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's very exciting to look for oil deposits and trying to maximize your profits while working against the clock. The upgrade system is pretty decent for the most part, which keeps the game fun in the late game.

The auctions are really simple but fun enough without taking too much time of gameplay, very well done.

Overall I had a lot of fun playing this game, but it makes me a little bugged that it could be better.

The fact that you have to play the Easy mode campaign first to unlock the advanced AI is pretty frustrating, cause there is no challenge in the first 8 hours of game. It could easily kill the game for you.

Some upgrades are pretty underpowered too, like moles and diamonds, which leaves no room for different strategies.

The gas mechanic is by far the worse part for me. It's boring, it's not very sophisticated and it makes no sense at all, it feels completely out of place compared with the other mechanics.

Players will have a variety of tools at their disposal, including; bigger pipes, larger silos, more carts to sell oil, scanners and even a pet mole. Money seems to be almost an issue in turmoil, if a player buys an expensive upgrade, and then drill on a plot of land with little oil, they could find themselves in the red.  


The art and sound design are both fantastic. The sound design is fun, lighthearted and overall, fir the game perfectly. The art style is cartoony but still  somewhat serous. The graphics and overall deal of the art fits the game flawlessly. Turmoil certainly did its art design right.


Turmoil does a lot right:


Many upgrade options 

Addictive 

Surprisingly fun

Looks and sounds great



Turmoil does do a few things badly: 

No difficulty settings 

Can be slow to start

Tends to be repetitive 

Lacks replayability  



Overall Turmoil is a fantastic game, It's well designed and quite a bit of fun. The price of $10.99 CND is a little steep but if picked up on sale, could be a fantastic buy for fans of casual games. 

Have a good one.

I find it often an oddly relaxing game for me, but always engaging in the hunt for oil and even gas in the normal and expert campaigns that I've played at ~10 hours each.  Its a real time strategy game in that all actions are in real time when finding & drilling for oil. After each ""year"" in a location drilling, there will be an opportunity to buy upgrades, buy favors from people at the saloon, borrow cash from the bank, bid on the next place to drill, and later buy shares to become the mayor of the city. I would've considered bought this game in Early Access if I had known about it earlier, as it only spent one year there.

Pros:
+Presentation & music: Perfectly captures the essence of drilling for oil the 1800's with the game's looks and soundtrack, which helps the game be oddly relaxing for me. The latter comes free with the game, albeit with a short number of tracks.
+Strategy: There's the real time part of handling the finding and drilling of oil, along with fluctuating prices and whether to sell or store the oil for later selling at a higher price. Outside of the year to year operations, there's considerable strategy of what upgrades to buy and when versus land & town share bidding.
+Upgrades: There were plenty of upgrades such that I didn't get to unlock them all for any given town building. The game's expert mode made me focus on what's the most critical to getting all the oil drilled & sold in a given year.
+Integrated tutorials/tips: As you start out in the game, the tutorial is well done, and same goes for the tips given after buying most upgrades. Very few if any tips are isolated to the pay-to-open envelopes (nominal in-campaign cash) behind the mayor's office.
+Speed up & pause exist: I'm very glad there's a speed up option, which I found especially useful when I'm down to my last oil deposit and am just waiting for it to be emptied out. Pause is nice during realtime, but doesn't allow for you to do anything other than look at most of what's going on.
+Single Level customization: There's a mode that lets you setup a game year in a particular location along with the amount of oil, rocks, and/or gas. Can use seed numbers to share with other players and ""compete"" for higher scores.

Neutral:
~Ongoing periodic development: Dev game updates since release (#27-34) have averaged about once a month, which is good, but I'll just leave this quote from their Dec 14 2016 news/post here: ""But we do like to investigate the possibility of more content in the form of a new map/areas. And if we do, we would probably want to add a game mechanic to the game. IF we go that direction we will consider releasing it as paid DLC. We’re also considering more drastic changes to the Single Level game mode that would allow for Leaderboards and Challenges."" Give all existing owners the first DLC for free, and I'll move this to the Pros section ;)
~No mid year saving: On the pause menu there's an option to abort the current year, but that's the equivalent of stopping all your progress and only taking what $ you've already earned. My guess is that each year without pausing or speed up takes 10-15 minutes, so make sure you can dedicate that amount of time or be willing to pause after starting a new year.
~Only a little built in save scumming: The game saves immediately after a drilling year is over. So that means if you make some town purchases or bidding that you don't like, you can exit before going drilling (starting the next year), reload your save, and you'll be back in town as if that town stuff didn't happen. I only used this in town share bidding in expert mode a couple times, and I still lost the campaign.

Cons:
-Wagon management: Its simple and easy to use, which may be better than being too complex or cumbersome, but its simplicity can cause some inefficiencies that may lead to expensive oil spillage. Changing the wagons from one company to another (Left Inc vs. Right Inc) can be disruptive if any of them are carrying oil (fair for strategy I guess), you can't assign wagons to a particular rig, and can't assign a rig's oil to go to a particular company (if my rig is on the left side, I'd like some of its wagons/oil to go Left Inc). I wouldn't call the wagon logic terribly buggy though - Its just that on rare occasions some wagons will behave in a way I don't expect, most notably when wagon counts are split between left & right.
-Weak campaign end game: Winning the campaign only does two things - Gives at least one achievement and gives you a ""Replay Bonus Island"" where there's max oil, gas, and rocks. The island is cool but doesn't add much extra gameplay for me.
-Only 1 campaign save spot available: Didn't bother me, but might bother some people. Like mentioned earlier, there's very little save scumming built into this game.

Anyway, the campaign is a good length, with good progression. You upgrade your equipment as you go along, allowing you to tailor your company to suit your playstyle. Also, game mechanics are introduced at a decent rate; this makes the game more interesting and less repetitive.

Also a single map mode, where you can enter seed numbers and replay levels (including the bonus level).

I really can't say much negative about this game, I think its that well done.
What I would change: the white font. Its hard to read.

I'd also like to point out that I, like several others, wish this game had a real multiplayer mode... unfortunately that won't happen. But I bring this up as IF it's ever added as a DLC or a sequel is made, I will definitely buy it.

I'm quite happy with my investment in this game, and highly recommend it. Try it out; you should know within the two hours whether you want a refund or not.

You play as an oil prospector, drilling for oil. As another reviewer noted, however, the game is much more about transporting the oil, storing it, and selling it at the right times. If you run out of space to store the oil, or wagons to transport it, you don't just lose out on the oil: you spill it, and you get absolutely massive fines for doing so. Happily, with some forethought - or a bribe, after a few games in the career mode - you can avoid or reduce your fines for spillage.

Replayability is a concern, of course; it's a concern with any game this simple in concept. However, I find myself coming back to this game fairly regularly. If you happen to own Mini Metro, you may find that this fills the same niche - except, while Mini Metro plays until you fail (or eternally, depending on the mode you play), this game has a defined ending point, thus more effectively scratching the itch for a casual 30-or-so-minute game.

You can play in 'single mode', and test out strategies, but it feels kind of like playing a board game against yourself. The game is clearly designed around the career mode - and that's okay, because it's pretty great. Playing against the AIs is decent fun, and being able to upgrade your abilities after every game is nice. Picking your plot of land on the map at auction is surprisingly fun - I found it most effective to not try and find the most oil-rich area, and just make do with what I had, but your mileage may vary. After all, strategies working differently for different people is part of the fun of this game - there's no 'one' strategy that works, you find the one that works for you. And while the game lets you snowball when you're ahead, when you're behind, it gives you some ways back into it with cheap loans.

Overall, the game seems pretty well-thought out, and while it's not perfect, it's just FUN. It's a casual game, good for relaxing, but yet it's not Euro Truck - it's fairly thinky, even if the decisions you're making aren't overly complex. And while it's true that you can sometimes get more content in a $1 mobile game, at least this one doesn't mine your data and send it to China. At $10, Turmoil is quite reasonably priced - you probably won't play it every day, but you'll be glad to have it around when you want to chill out.",1483419000,1483419000,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, should you buy this game? YES - absolutely. Easy to learn but plenty of depth too. You will be hooked on this game quickly, the power ups and money making are a very addictive strategy scenario.

OK, so here are the observations I have that could probably be improved to take the game from excellent to amazing:

* The game eventually becomes too repetitive after you beat the normal and expert mode.
* The expert mode didn't seem much different to me. It probably needs more changes to keep it interesting.
* The natural gas part of the game doesn't seem to quite come together at least for me. It's super expensive to get all the upgrades and lay the pipe need to use it. It's a neat idea, but it can be entirely skipped and you still win the game. To me, the game should be set up so that you need to take advantage of this in order to win. It seemed really hard to take advantage of this the way it was intended.
* The computer seems really dumb when it comes to the stock buying mechanic. I was able to buy up stock quite easily without being stopped by the CPU. By the fourth round I had had an insurmountable stock lead. The computer should be MUCH more aggressive when it comes to buying stock.
* The moles part of the game sounds interesting, but to me they just didn't seem to be worth the money or provide much benefit. You can basically just skip this and easily win. They dig up diamonds, but beyond that they didn't seem helpful.
*It would be great if you could do multiplayer local or over internet with a split screen. I would LOVE to play the game that way against a friend.

This is wonderful game for $6-$10 and I fully recommend it. It becomes repetitive and not quite so interesting after about 10 hours of gameplay, but this could be improved by the developers if they make some adjustments. It is just a bit too easy to win the game, and I wish the game would have been balanced to make we work harder to win.",1482443563,1482443563,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many of the upgrades seem to be a waste of money because the bountifal oil runs out so fast, and you don't need those expensive upgrades to get the crappy low yield oil fields dry. The AI somehow manages to pull out 120k of profit on a field that only has 50k worth of oil on it...

The games are too short to be any fun and again kind of make many of the upgrades pointless, by the time you have the money for them its dumb to use them / buy them. Wish the campaign was longer and had a cooler way to win than this slow attrition of buying up all the shares.

Played my first game for a couple of hours getting used to how everything worked and learning the tools and such, then decided to start over because I was so far behind my Rivals.  Started the Second Game, now knowing what to do, beat my Rivals and was Elected Mayor in about 6 hours.

For $9.99, a game with a campaign that lasts at least 6 hours is a pretty good deal and well worth the price.

I really hope the devs add onto this game, with additional Campaigns/Modes to make this game even greater than it already is.  Because as of now, the only replay factor after completing the original Campaign is to try and get the Steam Achievements, if you are into that sort of thing.  

As for the Single Mode, to me it's not enough to keep you playing the game.  

[b]Gameplay - 4 out of 5 //[/b]  The Mechanics of the game worked well, the only issue that I experienced while playing was the cursor on my screen seemed off from where my mouse cursor was.  This only happened occasionally and really isn't that big of a deal, it didn't break the game or make it unplayable at all.

[b]Entertainment - 4 out of 5 //[/b]  The game is very entertaining and if you are someone like me, it is very easy to get sucked in and want to keep playing it until you beat the Campaign.  Don't be surprised if after starting the game, 6 - 10 hours have went by before you realize it.  At some point things will start feeling as if you are repeating the same thing over and over, but the Devs did do a Good Job at trying to mix things up, with the Auctions for the Land, the Upgrades to your Machinery, the Change of Environment of the land your drilling in (Some may be more rocky than others, contain more oil/natural gas than other and may or may not contain a Diamond).

[b]Replayablity - 2 out 5 //[/b]  To me, other than trying to get all the Steam Achievements, there is no replayablity for this game at the moment.  

Overall, the game is definately worth paying $9.99 for and is enjoyable.  If they were to add onto the game, with more gamemodes / Additional Campaigns I would be willing to pay more for the game.",1482356620,1482356620,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember when games like this were free on Newgrounds. The gameplay is far too simplistic to be enjoyable. The only real opponent is the entirely arbitrary calendar that moves far too quickly to give the level any lasting impression. I suppose I was expecting more of a tycoon type game of starting out with one small plot of land, few resources, and basic tech, then expanding from there as you progress through the game. Instead, the first four levels played so similarly that I felt I was just replaying the saame thing over and over. Each round lasts about five minutes, the first ten seconds of which is spent waiting for the damn dowser to find any oil. That burns a week or two on the six-month calendar, even after buying a speed upgrade.

The cart AI is just terrible and completely uncontrollable. You'll think to yourself ""OK, I'll build two rigs and some storage tanks, then when the price gets high I'll unload and make a killing!"" Except you can't tell the carts to pull from the tanks first. Or which rig to pull from. YOU CAN'T COMMAND THEM AT ALL. The only solution to this is to buy enough carts to out-do the production of your rigs so they have no choice but to fill up from one of the storage tanks.

Oh, and you can't redo a level if you mess up. If you leave a level then that's it, you just lose money and move on.

I probably would have been ok with paying a dollar for this game, but even the discount of 40% isn't enough. I'd be FURIOUS if I had paid ten dollars for this, it absolutely failed to entertain at all. I gave it half an hour to see if maybe it just had a slow opening. Four missions playing identically was enough to pursuade me that either the slow opening drags on for far too long before they ratchet up the difficulty to something requiring at least an occasional neuron firing, or the rest of the game is going to be just as dull.

You do actually have to think a little with this game, judge whether it's worth searching for another oil pocket in the time remaining, or are you content you've got all the oil that's available and would the search be a waste of money.

I've not worked out a winning strategy yet, I keep going with the scanner upgrade, which I'm not sure is good, or if I'm just lazy.

Not touched many of the upgrades, so there's still replayability in this even after just over 7 hours of play.

The picking a plot of land feels a little like a gambling mini game, as each territory becomes used it becomes more obvious where the rich plots were and will be.

Value for money, well I'm going to use my tried and trusted Beer to Game ratio, I feel as long as you're getting triple the beer ratio out of a game then you're doing ok. I picked it up for about £4.6 on sale, so about a pint n half, which would take me about 45minutes, so I'm looking for a bit over 2 hours of play. I've had seven and I'm happy I'll still be coming to play more of this so we're in a cost effective amount in my opinion.

You are an oil tycoon starting with a limited budget hoping to strike it rich by choosing the right patch of soil to find the most oil, catchy huh?, and spending as little money as possible to extract it all out of the ground. All while trying to sell it for the best price. 

A series of available upgrades make this task easier when used right or more costly when used poorly. The AI competes against you in bidding for certain plots of land before you get to start building. Sometimes the plots can go for $1,000s in these bidding wars. 

There are two refineries to which you can sell your oil and the prices constantly fluctuate. But you only get a year to extract the oil from these plots. So, while you [b]can[/b] wait for a better oil price to come along, you can't wait forever. 

I would recommend this as a light, casual, management game as each level only lasts a short while, and you can even finish early.

Can play w/ just a mouse.
Has a lot of personality and charm.
Lots of neat surprises.
Can play different styles b/c of upgrades that matter and they are limited.

Cons: 
Really, none. I picked it up randomly one day.

It isn't difficult, but it isn't easy. Just a well designed, fun game.

For 10 Euros... well... that's actually quite disappointing. But before I get ahead of myself, let's start from the very beginning.

In Turmoil you basically just have to find Oil, sell it, make money and spend the money on... well things which will improve your way of making money, I guess.
That's pretty much it.
When I first heard of the game, it sounded like something I like. I just love idle games, clickers games, managment games or games where you actually... don't need to do much (because I am very lazy).
Even tho what I heard about the game got me excited, the excitement quickly started to drop after each minute of playing Turmoil. Why? Because even tho these types of games may be minimalistic, they most of the time still offer at least a few hours of content, even if it's just grinding and unlocking new stuff, but this game? Well...
It's kinda... well how should I put this?...
Boring to be honest.
For 10 Euros I at least expect some variation, even if it's just a little.
But in this game you pretty much do the same thing over and over again, with literally no ... challenge? Is that a good word to describe what I mean? I dunno.
It could have been good to some extend if there would have been more content, and with content I don't mean something like an extended story or exciting characters... or anything like that (because to be honest, these type of things don't really work all too well with these type of games) no, what I mean with content are things like Challenges, maybe different modes, or at least a leaderboard for god's sake...

Don't get me wrong, I do not hate this game, I just hate the fact that the game is being sold for 10 Euros, while other games are being sold for way less, and manage to offer WAY more content. I am a hobby programmer and I know how much work and time goes into a game, but to be fair, that doesn't mean that your game's value is automatically higher just because you put alot of effort into it.

I have to give the game some credit tho, because these days it is rather a rare thing to see a finished and ""polished"" game. Normally games are being crapped out even tho they are unfinished, buggy or anything like that.
So yeah, good job to whoever made this game, and I mean it! With a little more content, I even would have recommended this game, but at it's current state, there is literally nothing I could do or so without needing to lie.

If you want to support the creator, then go for it and buy the game. I - for my part - will not refund it, because I always support indie developers, as long as they are not throwing out a bunch of unfinished garbage.
But to everyone else, I sadly have to say that you might not want to spend your 10 bucks on this game.
If you're looking for some hours of casual fun, then you're wrong here. However, if you're looking for a few minutes a day of fun, then I guess the game could be suited for you. Just wait until it's on sale and grab it, because 10 bucks is way to much for the current game.",1474463168,1474463168,False,3,0,0.533103466033935547,3,True,False,False

361280,25559644,76561197971005960,0,23,597,0,525,1628800826,"Turmoil was released on June 2nd of 2016. The game was developed and published by Dutch indie developer Gamious. Turmoil is a simulation game biased on 19th century oil rush. The game originally released on windows only but has since been ported to OSX and Linux. 
The main goal of the game is to become mayor beating out the other 3 oil tycoons of the city. This is done by competing in auctions for parts of the city but you need money for the auctions and this is where the oil comes in.

The main gameplay in turmoil is spent drilling for oil. Each round in turmoil consists of a calendar year where you have to make as much profit on the land. Prior to each round you have to bid on the land that you’ll be using for the year and in later levels you also have to do a stock auction where a percent of the city goes up for sale. 

Once you’re out in the fields and drilling there’s really 3 main elements to the game. You have to find oil, drill for that oil, and transport it and sell it. Each element and timing is super important to having a good season. Each round usually starts out with you looking for oil usually by using dowsers who will indicate if there’s an oil patch beneath them. Usually there fairly accurate but sometimes I’ll have one find oil and I just can’t figure out where it is. 

Now that you found oil it’s time to setup an oil rig and drill down. Your unable to see what’s in the ground until you drill so you have to guess where you think the oil patch is, usually its directly beneath a dowser. As you play though the game your able to upgrade your ability to look for oil beneath the soil with moles and eventually a scanner.
 
After your pumping oil you have to ether store it or sell it. If the oil rigs capacity goes over a certain amount the oil will spill and you’ll get a fine at the end of the year. In order to transport the oil, you have to have horses and wagons move it ether to your storage facility or to the right or left company. As the year progresses the value of oil from each company is constantly changing so your goal is to sell the oil when the prices are high and store it when the prices are low in order to maximize your profits. 

At the end of each year your taken back to the town where your able upgrade pretty much every element of the oil drilling process. You can increase the maximum number of horses you can and how much they can carry or you can upgrade the pipes your oil rigs use In order to pump oil faster.

Additionally, in town your able to head to the bar and make deals with various people that will affect how the next year’s oil drilling will go. For instance, you can bribe the companies that buy your oil to keep their oil value above a certain level for the year, or you can bribe a city official to have your oil spillage fines waved for the year. 

As you progress in the game your taken though 4 areas that each have their own additions to the game’s gameplay. For instance, in the second area the desert you’ll be introduced to rocks under the ground that can’t be drilled though unless you get a certain upgrade. These areas keep the game fresh and also raise the difficulty as you play. 

Turmoil is a blast to play, the way the game evolves as you upgrade your gear each year makes the game really satisfying and makes you feel like you’re making real progress from year to year. Looking for hidden oil pockets couldn’t be more fun. The game’s campaign can be beaten in about 2 hours, however the game has a lot of replay value and you can easy lose track of time playing it when your really getting into it.

Graphically turmoil’s minimalist and clean look makes the game look incredible especially on large screens. The games simple graphics make all the colors just pop making the game a delight to look at.
Turmoil’s sound might be the weakest part of this game with most of the soundtrack consisting of a steel string guitar playing old west sounding music but that’s not to say it’s bad. The music does fit the game and is nice and calm when works well with this type of game it’s just very forgettable and not something I’d seek out to listen to.

Overall Turmoil is an extremely solid simulation game that has easy to pick up and play game play that keeps me coming back. The Campaign as you play it really makes you feel like your progressing year by year thanks to the games upgrade system. The gameplay it’s self is a blast with enough things to balance and strategy to the game keeps it extremely engaging and fun to play. Turmoil is without a doubt worth checking out if your into simulation games.

In my opinion, one of the most calm but exciting games I have ever played.  The strategy and timing plays a key role in this game, as you have to manage money, sell oil to different companies, and time it all perfectly within a year.  On top of the mining, you can purchase upgrades to your oil rigs, horses, and so much more to keep you entertained with the 5-8 hour campaign.  After this, you can play single levels or go into the expert mode.

Cons:

-Normal campaign is a little on the easy side

-Replayability value is lacking

-Price is steep



Pros:

-Extremely addicting the first time around

-Expert and normal campaign to keep you busy

-Great soundtrack

-Overall just a very fun and unique experience!

I think 5 dollars would be the right point, but if you have 10 laying around or there's a sale it could be worth it.

Familiar-feeling resource collecting/upgrading/selling game that is somewhat fun and feels very satisfying even though it isn't particularly innovative or standout. Main problem is that it just doesn't have too much depth, the upgrades are mostly the usual (collect resource X faster, store more of resource X, transport X faster) and none save one or two really change your strategy. 

The campaign lasts about 6 hours but becomes repetitive towards the end without enough new mechanics to shake it up.

Review Below

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AvgCRFpHEk?sub_confirmation=1

Turmoil is an RTS resource and money management game set in the oil rush days of what one can only assume is the American West that is a lot of fun to play.

While having simplistic graphics don't let this game fool you, there is a decent amount of strategy here as the game progresses. This is one of the better mining/money managment games for it's price that I have played in a while.

While it is only $9.99 it will offer anyone playing between 6 to 12 hours of game play on the standard mode which then leads to an expert mode after completing the first run through.

Oil location is randomised which give the game a certain level of replayability but not as much as higher budget games

Pros
-------------------
- Great aethstetic, graphics and music really suit the mood of the game
- Easy to learn game play that introduces new elements as the game continues forcing you to evolve your play style and come up with new strategies
- A fun and well priced game
- various upgrades to improve your gaming experience

Cons
-------------------
- Some may consider the game to be too short at a dozen hours long.
- The style of the game may not appeal to everyone.",1471398029,1471399215,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

[b] Long Review [/b]

How can i put this game? Hmm. Its a Resource Management Simulator or in short, an Oil Tycoon! You basically have to get the most of the shares you can by the end of the game. To win you need to get 50% of the shares. Or more. Turmoil offers players a visually charming, tongue-in-cheek take on the simulation genre inspired by the 19th century oil rush in North America. You have to build a rig, create an efficient pipe network and bring up the oil to store it in silos. Sell the oil at the best times to maximize profits. Then buy essential upgrades in town to cope with rock, gas and ice. Acquire more town shares than your competitors in a bid to become the new mayor.

This game offers a campaign and a single game with all the items unlocked like Scanners, Moles and Drilling through rocks. The Campaign is a challenge and if you find it too easy and win the game, it offers you a new gamemode! The new mode is Expert. If you do not want the aim of Expert mode and the different characters to be announced, please do not hover over the black box.

[spoiler] In expert mode, there is 4 characters. Jim Bob, Larry, Lisa and Henry. This is different to normal mode due to them having advantages. All are different and its best to choose the one that suits you the most. Jim Bob's little cousin will run ahead and mark your first oil field before you even get there. That will be helpful so you may not need a dowser for a while and make more profit. Larry likes to live large and takes $2500 to each plot instead of $2000. This is very helpful and gives you an advantage than the other rivals. Lisa charms her way into Barney’s life and never has to pay Spillage fines. This is helpful if you are a Spillage..r? Henry is a Mole’s best friend. They will spot a Diamond for him without effort. This can be convinent if you want some more money than the other rivals. [/spoiler]

The game is fun and challenging and people say 'You finish it in 4 - 6 hours and thats it.' That is a lie. May take 4 - 6 hours depending on your speed to finish the normal campaign due to the easy AI Sytem. You hardly need to think and its just timing. Expert mode takes ages. You need to try it out! It is fun and will provide hours of fun.

This is a fun game and if you are commited to the repetetive gameplay, buy it and dont look back!

[b] Short Review [/b] 
This is a oil tycoon game. It's fun and its worth the money. You can maybe get 10 - 30 hours of gameplay if you play it right!

Its not to hard to win but given my lack of achievements somewhat harder to win well (I'm yet to try the harder mode that unlocks-which may make it more interesting/challenging once you've learned the tactics to employ).

I bought this game with my own $10.00 US.

This game is not very deep but wow is it engaging.

Such a simple mechanic presented with simple visuals.

The idea is to lease a plot of land... spend a year looking for oil, drill it up, store or sell it (when price is high) without spilling it, hopefully while making an obscene profit, go back to town and purchase upgrades and technology, then do it all over again the next year while a western themed guitar gently plucks away in the background.

I seriously doubt I will spend hundreds of hours on it but I have already gotten my $10 of enjoyment out of it.

It is a great game that can be played between other larger titles.

 ""Performance. It may look like a simple game, there are a lot of individual elements in the ground and above the ground, and the distribution of oil within the network needs quite some cpu as well.
Long story short: we tested the game on 60 fps on slower computers and it wasn't good enough. We don't want to leave them out."" 

So you dont want to leave the people with slower PC's out and you do this by locking the frame rate to 30. Punishing the people with decent to high-end. Logic. They feel it is to much work to cap it at 60 or just let the few people with dinosaurs for PC's run at 50-20fps. 

If you are like me and 30fps makes you sick your stomach. Then do NOT get this game!

-NEW- 

I was really hard on the game for the 30fps thing but they updated it and now I can 100% say I love the game. Glad to see devolpers listening to the people that play the game. Big companies never take the time to pay attention to the little guy. Now that the game is 60fps+ I can really play it without having to stop because getting dizzy. But for a small devloper this game is truley a great game.

This game is great if you want to kill time without getting overwhelmed. There is almost 0 learning curve to the game making it easy for anyone to play. There is so much you can do with a oil tycoon game and what they have done so far has not failed to impress. I can not wait to see what else they add to such a home feeling game!

 If there is one thing im waiting im excited for is the addition of difficulty. That would make it more of a challenge for someone looking for a difficult game or easier for someone looking for the oppisite.

Each level is the same, send a diviner to find oil, place the well, buy carts and build a silo and place the oil in the silo until the price is for what you will sell it for. And in between levels buy some upgrades to make a easy game, even easier.

It has a fun soundtrack and a relaxed feel to it, but it is very mindnumbing in the fact I was expecting more of a challenge to making money, having to think out a strategy etc, but you cannot run out of money basically and cannot go bust.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Some people who take a quick glance at this game before they buy it may look at it as a simple clicker game, (ex. adventure capitalist or cookie clicker..) but thats not the case, 

This game is fun to progress through and its very calm, I find that if I make a mistake in this game its not to much work to start over the game completely. This is because the only reason you would have to start over is because you may be new to the game and there is a small amount of trial and error aspects to purchasing upgrades for your tools in this game.

[h1]About The Game[/h1]

This game is about 4 characters (you being one of them) competeing in the oil market trying to strike heaps of oil patches for a quick profit. 
Theres only so much land you can mine up and destroy so when it comes down to it you have to start bidding for bigger peices of the land.
if you do however succeed in your oil mining oporation you can choose to expand with a vast amount of upgrades;
you can go from something as small as buying yourself a pet mole to help you find oil to upgrading to larger oil refineries to completely suck away any natural resources left in the earth. You may also find other treasures that lay beneath...

I think the main thing I found lacking is the upgrades, there are quite a lot of them, but only about ~20% are actually worth anything. There are a lot of really superficial upgrades that are mostly worthless or overpriced, not to mention a lot of the upgrades should really be passive, but instead require further spending during a mining year. I can understand the drill requiring a rig upgrade to be able to go through rocks, but purchasing the speed upgrade for your rigs is ridiculous, that should be a passive upgrade. Then most of the workshop upgrades are useless, really the only ones worth getting are the dowser upgrades.
Then there's the AI. On normal, they're pretty stupid, and will rarely make earnings anywhere near yours if you play well. But then, on expert, it's completely rigged against you. The first few digs you only get a month or half a year to mine oil, which barely allows you to get a few thousand dollars in earnings. However, your opponents will be making 10-20k in earnings, completely eclipsing you in the early game on expert, which only screws you over later on. The AI in general just needs a complete overhaul for balance.
That all said, it's still a fun game, I got it full price but frankly I would have to recommend waiting for the price to drop or it to go on sale to really be worth buying in its current condition.

Instead, it's just world seeds to make a single, constricted level that ends (completely) after 10 minutes of play. If it were, say, a giant world that never ends and there's endless possibilities and things to discover, that would make more sense when it comes to procedural generation. 

The campaign itself is just a string of single games and an added town where you can buy the upgrades, instead of just having them all like in Single Game. The campaign started to bore me after about 12 land leases. Everything is pretty linear, pretty simple, and really has no replay value once you've discovered everything there is to do, and realize how little time you have to actually play the game.

That's not exactly the game to do it, but it will bring you in the mood for it. ...I suppose every old-day oil magnat had these days.

In your first playthrough (took me about 10h) it's a light hearted simulation. The competition is not that dangerous, and will snatch precious land plots from you, but extend their financial ressources in the process. You will mitigate that and beat them in the long run. 

The levels itself play the same and you will develop a routine. Frequent upgrades to your equipment and the environment will ask some adapting of this routine. Mainly you gamble on waiting to sell your oil, hoping that the price will rise before the time is up or your silos full. Managing to get all oil and gas out and quitting early was the biggest achievment for me.

Overall, the game is really fun and 100% worth the $10.99 CAD I paid.

PROS:

1) Good, relaxing fun.
2) Polished gameplay, no bugs so far.
3) Great artstyle, easy on the eyes.

CONS:

1) Not a ton of depth so far (only on the deserts so far)
2) So far, the other characters in the game feel a bit out of place. I would like for some more interaction with them somehow besides land and share auctions.

The idea is simple, drill for oil and sell it. But with that simple premise you still have a lot of things that keep you always challenged:

Do you sell low and not worry about overflow or storage? If you choose to stockpile, you might run out of time and not get to sell the oil at all. 

You never know where the oil is, so how much will you invest in exploring for oil? If you don't, you might lose thousands of dollars in oil, but you might also waste thousands of dollars fruitlessly searching for oil that isn't there. 

How much money will you save for making important game winning purchases later in the game? (Won't get into that too much because, spoilers). If you save it all, you're going to miss out on important upgrades, but you could lose out on important things later on if you don't have any left.

Keeping track the different methods of earning money will keep your character from dropping out of the race.

Balance: 6
The balance is in the player's favor. Unfortunately, the artificial intelligence feels too easy to defeat.

Graphics: 8
These type of games are not created for utilizing high-end computer hardware, so they did great on finding choosing a distinctive style of art for the game.

Audio: 7
The music is excellent, and there are multiple sound effects throughout the game.

Content: 9
Luckily the game has a lot of packed in unique options to try new ways to win (or lose) the game.

Controls: 9
Incredibly easy to learn the game.

Gameplay: 7
It gave me several hours of entertainment, which was worth its price.

It was actually good enough that I've played too much in a row to be willing to try and beat expert mode right away, but I'll get back to it someday...

I really like the mood and setting, gameplay is pretty good too (but gets a bit repetitive if you go hardcore on it :p). 

Games go like this: 
- auction against AI competitors for land
- start digging game, its a few minutes long
- make money from your digging based on the amount of resource in your land and how succesfully you extract it
- go back in town to buy upgrades and get a new land
- mid game you start auctionning victory points against AI competitors

Note that you don't interact with AIs while in the digging part of the game, they don't affect oil market price or anything like that. Can't tell of expert mode as I haven't tried.

I feel it could use both a MP mode and a world map with varying lands for SP but that doesn't take away the fun it has to offer.

Got it on sale but felt polished enough to be worthy of the pricetag even for just 9h of play time.

Your main goal, and main problems will resolve around getting all the oil in a level out of the ground and sold within one year. It does what it does and it does it fairly well. The pipe building is intuitive(Simply drag the mouse to where you want it), and everything makes sense. Oil only flows as fast as the smallest pipe, thus you need to make sure you don't have a bottleneck in your system. And if you pump oil up faster than you can carry it away then you spill it, incurring a fine. The game explains mechanics well and there are enough upgrades and level varieties where it does not become a chore or too similar to other levels.

A solid foundation, improved upon by hazards such as rocks and natural gas which can be used for profit as well, with the right upgrades, or just by adding it to your regular oil pipes so the pressure brings the oil up faster. As before, you may spill some if you bring oil up too fast, so be careful about what you drill.
To further the gameplay there is a solid campaign that last just long enough to be a good experience without overstaying its welcome. You need to buy the upgrades, lease land you think has a good amount of oil in it, and compete with 3 AI players trying the same. Eventually leading to auctions for shares which allow you to win the campaign once you have a majority share. Even if you are not into optimising things, the base gameplay is well enough and the game forgiving enough that you can get away with a profit just drilling for oil, though you may have difficulty making large profit margins.

Turmoil is a simple but solid game, build on a good concept with good execution at a competitive price. If you're looking for a few days worth of entertainment, Turmoil is a good choice.",1465132649,1465215894,True,28,0,0.756244480609893799,1,True,False,False

During this time I drilled for oil and gas on several different map themes from the desert to the arctic.
All in all the game have a very good balance.. It start out easy, but in the end game you really need allot of your cash to buy shares in the town.. ( you need 50% town shares to win the game ).

Along your journey you can buy many different kinds of upgrades such as larger pipes and larger wagons ect.
You can even in the town buy different random help such as oil prices never going below example 0.90usd pr barrel, and sometimes you can even get a hint about what map zone you find more oil than normal.. However be aware that your competitors sometimes will try to get the same area and then you will end up in a kind of bidding war to fin the drilling rights.. sometimes you can even use this to your advantage.

All in all a nice little ""puzzle"" type game where you goal is to find the oil pockets and sell it to the highest price possible.
Yes the game is somewhat much the same, but actual I normal do not like such games at all, but this one did not make me feel bored.

Your base of operations is the town - where buildings offering upgrades become steadily available over the first few levels, and to get into the game proper - first you must buy land.  The tutorial is very quick, but guides you through without leaving you wondering what you're supposed to do.  There are four regions; divided into maybe 40 plots (I didn't count) meaning 10 levels to play, as each rival works on a different plot each round.  The amount of oil in each is random, but based on connecting plots - so once you've uncovered a few, you aim to choose the ones near areas where there was a good supply in the previous level, for the best chance of a playing area rich with black gold. Obviously your rivals will bid against you for what they think are the best plots, meaning sometimes taking a chance on an unexplored area or digging your heels in to try and burn through their money are both valid strategies.

When the game starts proper; things look incredibly simple.  Each level starts with a small amount of money from your main pot, from which you must buy dowsers (who prospect for oil underneath them) and wells (from which you can start drilling) and wagons - so you can transport the oil you bring up to the surface to one of the buyers, or to a silo if the prices aren't high enough. Oil supplies are limited but so is time to extract - with bonuses on offer for quitting the level early having extracted and sold all of the available product. Sell your oil to buy more of the tools, but save some money for profit to take into the next level - whatever you do, don't spill any because the fines are heavy.

For a game that's basically dragging and dropping pipes - there's a lot on screen to look at and do, and it's incredibly addictive.  Two days after buying, and I finished the campaign as the winner - only to find out I'm now invited to play expert mode against smarter competitors with special powers. 

All in all, a great distraction and one you'll definitely be able to play over and again thanks to its randomly generated levels and it's expert mode - but to nitpick; there should be a way to enter your own character name, high score tables for the levels and for the campaign as a whole so that you can check how well you're doing against previous plays.

[i]Essentially you are trying to turn profits by drilling for oil.[/i] Your success is largely dependent on things such as what strategy you choose to employ to find oil and extract it out of the ground. You have options to upgrade your equipment and abilities through spending your hard-earned money. This is definately a time-based game where you will drill for oil for a set amount of time, which obviously puts more emphasis on strategy.

What I really liked about [i]Turmoil[/i] is that it is pretty laid-back. I sat on the couch and only played with the mouse. My wife even got interested, which is rare. Nothing is too complex here - in fact this would probably do well on mobile. I hate mobile games (as many of you know), but this has just enough complexity to transcend that genre.

+Music is fitting, and quite nice.
+Game mechanic is simple to learn, yet takes a bit of time to master.
+Quite addicting.

Turmoil is one of those brilliant games that hooks you in on beautiful looks and a concept so simple that it can't amazes you when you're still playing hours later. 

The setting is great, the gameplay engaging and the pacing actually well thought out. Unlocks aren't thrown at you straight away, and there's a real sense of building an empire based on performance. 

To this end, the customary 'throwing all the financial information at the player after each level' is well done and actually understandable to someone without a degree in business - something that very few business management games seem to get right.

beta 0.248

There is a soft, almost zen like, wonderful quality to this game.  That isn't to say that this is an overly easy game or one lacking in challenge.  Far from it, figuring out what to spend money on, upgrades versus stocks, loans versus skipping a desired plot, there's a lot of depth and challenge to this game.  There were more than a few times when I left a round having lost money, and cursing choices I'd made.  But through it all, there's this sense of calm peacefulness as you play that puts you in a relaxed spot.

The music is a perfect fit for the setting.  Western themed, yet, again a bit soft and relaxing, save maybe the last month of each round where it takes on a slightly more frentic tone, reminding you to move that oil, even if it is at a loss.

The graphics are somewhat cartoonish and a bit simplified, but it works, and works well.

There are a few things I'd like to see, like maybe game settings, more or less opponents, a difficulty slider, etc.  Also some of the upgrades get ridiculously expensive.  FAR too expensive for how late in the game they appear, when you're trying to save money for stock auctions.

But over all, I'm amazed how much I enjoyed this game.  I ran through my first entire playthrough in a little over twelve hours, but I don't doubt I'll be giving it at least one more go-through before un-installing it.  I would recommend this game to anyone on the fence about buying it.",1452477520,1452477613,True,5,0,0.521245002746582031,7,True,False,True

Updated Review:

After putting some serious work into this little time sponge I have a few more thoughts for potential buyers.

The people who are knocking it for being repetitive are not wrong, it is somewhat.   There is a fine line between risking repetitive and throwing too much at a player, I hope it gets a bit deeper, both in gameplay features as well as the ground itself in the late game in the future.

But those reviews saying ""its not worth a dollar"" have a REALLY messed up sense of value.   Go play Atari 2600, find the best games it had and prepare for disapointment and realize those were 25 bucks in 1980....like $80 todays money.
Turmoil was the price of a Starbucks Latte during the Christmas sale, even at full price you are going to hit under the dollar an hour price/fun mark easy.

The AI competition is weak right now, this might come as a relief for people that often get thrashed in some tycoon games (I do)  but pretty much if you can fog a mirror you are going to win the campaign mode.   So if you are looking for challenge NOW its not there, fair warning.   The AI is supposed to get better eventually™ and there will be a hard mode someday.   The AI being potato heads doesn't affect the meat of the gameplay at all, but you WILL win.

Still totally a buy, fun to play now and you get to watch something addicting come together and be polished.   Its already way past the stage of being a potential money waste even if they just gave up tomorrow and did no more development.",1451808149,1452240345,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,True

Every feature in the game works the way it's supposed to, I haven't encountered a single bug/glitch of any kind and I've been playing around with it for a couple hours now.

Pros:
-Easy game to understand and play, rules of gameplay are explained fairly quickly and without long sections of text to read.
-Fun light hearted humor
-No Bugs (or they're very well hidden)
-Quick game with autosave so it's easy to jump in and out of so you don't need to set aside an evening just to play it
-Stays within it's scope, most early access games have a huge list of features they want to implement but don't focus on the features that are already in play. These Davs have made a fully functional game and not left features dangling around in some half assed attempt to expand the game.

Cons:
-Gameplay is repetitive, I personally like the gameplay but unless you're playing the campaign setting there isn't a whole lot of nuance to the individual matches
-Some elements aren't fully explained, in the campaign you can bid for new land to expand your industry and the computer seems to have some algorithm in place which will cause them to pay up to 20x the base value of a property but there is no indication that it will be good.

My major crtisism is that there are times when there is absolutely nothing to do. I mean after you have found all the oil, you have fixed the market oil price so you really don't need to keep an eye on it and you are just waiting for oil to be pumped out of the ground.

The mystery of where the oil pockets are, how big they are and how to most efficiently and profitably get it out of the ground is fascinating.  The music is absolutely perfect too!  Some of the upgrades seem too pricey to be useful (the diamond upgrade for moles, and moles in general, the gas valves, Etc.).  The AI seems a little lacking - I have no problem far out-earning them.  I think multiplayer would be fun - real-time or, better yet, one turn at a time kind of a play-by-email style where Steam notifies you of your turn, you play one map, and then wait to be notified your friends have played and it's time for another turn.  Not sure if I like the gas mechanics or not.  When connected to oil, it pushes the oil out at ridiculous speed and there is always a spill.  I haven't spent the 40k to use gas to increase oil prices - not even sure how that would work or how much benefit it would really be.  Consequently, I haven't really played with the mechanic to expand the gas pockets because I don't use the gas much.  Also haven't found diamonds to be worth the trouble - they should be worth more money.

Not sure what to suggest for improvements - maybe mining?  Coal? Gold?  Maybe a way to collect and sell the gas?  Maybe some sort of underground gremlins that break pipes occasionally?  If mining, a cave-in perhaps?

Essentially the game is broken down into two sections between which you alternate: In between years you are in the town doing upgrades and bidding on land to drill in the next year, and then you set off to your leased land to drill for the year.

Initially I was a bit thrown by the fact that you only get a limited time to drill for oil on every piece of land, but this is actually what makes the game brilliant. You can only lease each piece of land for a year, which means that you have to generate as much profit as possible during that time. Starting out you can't be sure exactly how much oil there will be on a given piece of land, which is interesting because:

1) If you invest too much early on (in carriages, oil drills, storage tanks) there might not be enough oil to justify the investment.
2) But if you don't invest enough you might not get a substantial amount of oil out and thus make less profit.

Add to this the fact that the two companies that you sell the oil to has prices that vary over time and you have a very interesting game about balance, efficiency and time management. Each time you start on a new piece of land, you gradually learn how much oil there is available, and you have to adjust your strategy accordingly to ensure maximum profit.

Turmoil is a tycoon management game in which you dig for oil! It's 1899 in the land of the oil obsessed and it's time for you to get your share of the moolah coming out of this thriving industry. Start small, with four competitors and the most basic equipment and gradually work your way through the ranks, unlocking new equipment/upgrades as you go in order to out-grow the other businesses and eventually buy enough shares in the town to become its owner/new mayor.

I first played and reviewed this game in July of 2015, one month after its Early Access release. What I found was a good start to the game but there was only the first area of the campaign available and roughly two hours of game time to be had. In the months since then Turmoil has improved massively thanks to the hard work of the developers and the game now is as good as I would expect it to be at full release. My original review rated the game as ‘Worth Purchasing on Sale’.

[h1]Presentation [/h1]

It’s safe to say Turmoil is one hell of a good looking game. The art style is incredibly simple yet very easy on the eye and the models in the game all look great and remain consistent with the overall style. The UI is very good and while I do feel as though it’s a little bit too big when you’re actually in the drilling portion of the game it doesn’t block anything and so its size isn’t much of an issue.

[h1]Gameplay [/h1]

You begin each level by bidding on a plot of land, once you've acquired land you're given $2000 out of however much you have to start your oil venture. To find oil you send out dowsers (other methods are unlocked later) who will seek out oil for you, then you simply place a drill and put pipes down to wherever the oil is. You buy horse drawn carts to ferry your oil to one of two businesses or both though it's best to send all your oil to whichever gives you the best price per unit. Should you not be happy with the offered prices you can build oil storage units which hold a certain amount of oil, as soon as you decide to sell your oil again your horse drawn carts will take the oil from storage to whichever oil company you wish to sell to.

As I mentioned there are upgrades as well as new equipment to be unlocked as you progress. There’s at least one upgrade for every aspect of your drilling business from increased drill speed to faster dowsers. The upgrades start out relatively cheap but as you progress further in the game the new upgrades become more expensive. Some upgrades have multiple levels and the price for the next upgrade is always more than the one before it.

Returning to land in the game, there are four different regions for you to drill in, each one introducing a new gameplay element, I’ll remain vague with what they are to avoid any possible spoilers. The first area is the most basic and is simply seeking oil and then selling it. The second, third and fourth areas all introduce at least one thing which can either benefit you or cause you some serious monetary losses depending on how careful you are in utilising it. Obviously that’s a bit of a generalisation for the purpose of staying vague but you get the idea. If you want to know exactly what is added in each area please ask and I’ll put it in the comment section with a spoiler tag.

Returning to the bidding process, as with anything, it’s a bit of a gamble. Once an area has had its oil extracted by you or one of the AI players, it’s given a rating for how much oil it has generally between twenty and fifty where fifty is a load of oil and twenty is getting you nothing but chump change. These ratings are then visible to you next time you head to a land auction. While there’s no guarantee that the next area will have a good amount of oil the areas close to each other generally have a pretty similar rating and that’s how you have to decide where you wish to place a bid. This can also be a very strategic part of the game, if you play it right it’s relatively easy to get the AI to spend ridiculous amounts of money for a plot of land but that of course comes with the risk that they won’t outbid you and you’ll be throwing your own money down the drain.

The stock auction, part of one of the game’s victory conditions, works in a very different way to the land auction. Each time you return to the town after twelve months of drilling for oil the mayor puts up a random number of shares for you to bid on. Bidding opens at the amount of money is held by the richest player and gradually decreases until either yourself or one of the AI characters decides to buy the shares for the price displayed.

[h1]Miscellaneous [/h1]
[list]
[*]Each area has its own environmental design and all four of them look great.
[*]The soundtrack fits well with the game’s style and is pretty relaxing but the game would benefit from having a couple more tracks thrown into the mix.
[*]Turmoil is kind of like those ‘one more turn’ games except you often start a new level without wanting to. I found myself so drawn into the game that I found myself starting a new level even when I had decided mere moments ago to turn the game off and play something else after finishing the level I was on. 
[*]There’s currently no way to save and quit during a twelve month drilling period which is quite annoying, if for some reason you need to go during a drilling period you have to stop the level, massively decreasing how much money you could have earned from that level. I asked the devs if they’d be adding this and they said it’s a possibility but it would be difficult for them to implement.
[*]The game needs a few things to be explained better, such as the fact that a triangle pipe connection means the pipe is drawing oil as well as the fact that pipes don’t need to lead to the bottom of an oil deposit to collect all of the oil. 
[/list]

[h1]Verdict [/h1]

[b]Worth Purchasing. [/b]

In its seven months of Steam Early Access, Turmoil has improved massively and become what feels like a full release title. Turmoil is a great management, tycoon game with a great art style, simple yet addicting gameplay and plenty of upgrades to keep things interesting throughout the campaign. If you’re a fan of management/tycoon games then this is definitely one worth picking up.

In Turmoil, you are supposed to make a fortune by drilling for oil in a western-like environment. Its visual appearence is fairly simple but charming.
 
Turmoil is one of those games, which are extremely [strike]addicting[/strike] satisfying - while the game mechanics are simple enough to avoid frustration, the gameplay leaves enough room for various strategies to succeed.

Whereas you are simply building oilrigs and horsecarts in the beginning, a good deal of technology becomes available as you progress in the game. Speaking of which, there are three different biomes: fertile land 1&2, desert and arctic. Within these areas, subplots are auctioned between player and AI.

This game is the perfect multitasking stimulus, maybe a little shallow in the end. Nevertheless, it is quite balanced - and loads of fun to play. As the oilpockets are randomized, the replay value is great,

I have played a few hours of this game and intend to play more. There is a few reasons why. First of all the game is being constantly updated to add new features and fix some very minor non gamebreaking bugs.  Secondly this games replayability is  insane. I feel as if I can play 100+ hours of this game and it only cost 10 dollars. Third of all the game features awsome music and it looks beautiful.  

I am in the process of a video series on this game and you can find it here: [url=https://youtu.be/7yT2B1Zn__0]here[/url].

However, don't go in expecting a long-form strategy game. After you bid on a plot of land and go to develop it, you have exactly one day to extract from it before it's gone forever. No matter how much oil you pull out, once you've run out of time it's gone forever. That's a very different game than one where each plot continues to make money as you pull oil out of the ground, or one where you revisit the same plots over and over.

That's not necessarily a bad thing, the game is fun and challenging. But it's perhaps not the game I wanted to buy. This game is less of a meal and more of a snack, meant to be eaten in small portions before being abandoned. It's the sort of thing that feels like it looked wistfully at mobile games and wanted to fit in, but knew it was too complicated to do so.

The only real gripe I can bring up is that the prices of oil fluctuate _completely_ unexpectedly. There is obviously some pattern to when they rise and fall, and at what rate, but so much of the game is built on random chance that you'll be able to sell your oil to someone with a good price that it feels less as if you're getting better at the game, and more that you ""struck oil"" and got lucky with the RNG.

Again, that may just be how the game wants to be played. But to me the differences in my expectations and reality were enough to make me not want to play more.",1441348202,1441350389,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,True

Make a person have to start all over with that drill rig. Put it so the banker comes into it more, I never had to take a loan out. Later in the game, drill sights should have stone close to the surface to make you borrow money early. Make it harder to make money, after my first mission, I at least made $30,000 on every map. Like I said, I like the game but the level of difficulty did not go up as the game progressed. The hardest part was doing the same thing over and over trying to finish it. Maybe in later levels, for a huge price you can add pipe lines right to the buyers. I liked being able to pump gas and jack up the price of oil but once that started, I was turning out $50,000 on a map. Hold all your oil till you find all the gas pockets, pump the gas in to boost the price, and run every wagon you have at that buyer. Simple, but fun. Maybe a mini game of claim jumpers?

TL:DR at the end for those of you that don't like :words:

Let me just say, that as a 35 yr old man I was COMPLETELY wrong about Turmoil.  I saw the graphics and I passed over Turmoil almost half a dozen times despite being 'recommend for you' over 4 times by steam.  The game is unfinished, but it's done enough that you'll have a really fun time playing it.  Most of the fixes or features that have to be finished are AI behavior, long term progression and most likely trying to make the game have a feature where you can simply continue after beating the 4 regions around the town.  

I'll have to admit, even though turmoil is only $10 I did my standard 'Lets watch a lets play to figure out if its REALLY worth it.'  I youtubed it and three 20 minute episodes later I had to buy it because it was driving me nuts just how inefficent the person playing the game was being.   

The game seems stupidly simplistic when you look at it and the first few levels will be childs play to all but the youngest gamers (sub 10 yrs old I would say) but the town development, oil drilling upgrades and trying to cost the AI players more funds just for the sheer hell of it make the game just become a truly awesome experience for me.

Anyone can dump down some prospectors, find the oil and sell it to one of the purchasing companies, and if that was all Turmoil was it would still be a [b]good [/b] game.  What makes it a [b]GREAT[/b] game comes from price flucuations, being able to hold product, upgrading your infrastruture per map (rig placement, silo placement, number of carts etc) and finally your underground pipeline placement on the later maps to gather natural gas and oil in a way that really makes you able to pump up your profits (pun intended).

And this game seems to have hit all the right buttons when it comes to being an economic game that many people would want to play.

1.  Simple to learn
2.  Complex to master
3.  Makes you want to play 'just one more map.'  (this had me playing it the first night from 11pm when I bought it to 4am on a work night, another good sign)
4.  The graphics, at first, seem childish but as the game progressed and the music played really grew on me enough that I was really enjoying the atmosphere after just 3 'turns'.
5.  The sound track is actually really well done, for a $10 game I find that refreshing and a tad inspiring that the game dev's put this sorta effort into it.
6.  You can tell this isn't just a 'lets make cash' game that many indie games seem to be these last years.  You can TELL it's been a labor of love for the developers.

If this is any indication of what the devs/game studio is capable of I'm going to write some suggestions for them and I'm going to hope like CRAZY that we'll see a Turmoil 2 within a year or two.  

I've played tons and tons of economic games over the past 30 years, from something as simple as Lemonade stand (back on a 386 , to as complex as EVE online and everything in between.  If I had the means, I'd love to see these guys write something with this level of care and passion as I felt when I played the orginal ""Industry giant 2"" or ""Capitalism"".  Yes, it's reaching a big, BIG bit, but I've seen a massive derth in this genre compared to seeing an endless stream of FPS clones of CoD, RTS's that can't match up to Starcraft and all sorts of studios that produce endless clone after clone while chasing the same dollars that would be theirs with a little orginalility.   Turmoil is [b]ORGINAL[/b] and the devs haven't been stomped on by that 'corporate' mentality that screams 'shove the game out the door so we can meet payroll.'   I really, really, REALLY hope they don't lose that and their next games are just as good, if not better then this.

Turmoil has been an unexpected treat for this 'old' gaming vet and I'm recommending it to anyone at all that enjoys playing economic games.  I'd go so far as to say that if Turmoil was $20 I'd still buy it after seeing the let's play I saw on Youtube.  After actually playing it I can say it's underpriced and with the winter sale screaming our way, it'll be dirt cheap shortly for those that are budget consious.  It's a budget meal at the moment and you should consider it.  

Oh and they aren't done yet, I was reading their announcements and they aren't close to being done yet.  Oh and they are activily responding to suggestions, questions and bug reports on their steam forum page.  That's a very nice touch to me, they might not want to hear from this grizzild old vet but I have hope that they will. 

I always try to sum up my reviews/articles with a TL:DR, so here goes.

[b][u]TL:RD[/b][/u] Do I recommend Turmoil?  After almost 5 years of games being 2x to 4x as expensive Turmoil had me playing 'just one more turn' after the first 20 minutes for a 5th of the cost.

It has a slight boardgame feel with the map view, with players bidding on plots of land they believe have the most oil, with a risk of bidding lots on a plot with little to tons of oil.

The price of oil for both sellers fluctuate constantly, so knowing [i]when[/i] to sell is just as important as knowing how much to spend on carts, rigs, and silos. 

It almost seems at this point the AI cheats by knowing how to find oill, without having to spend money on upgrades, so they'll always have the most money.

This isn't one of the ""take your money and run"" alphas.  This is a constantly updated and supported ealry access game.

[h1]Locating Oil:[/h1]
   [b]How it really works:  [/b]
    Geologists study local surface rock formations to decide where to survey, and then analyse those surveys to determine likely spots to drill  Skill at both steps determines the value
    [b]How Turmoil handles it:[/b]
    Pick a spot on the board at random, or near previous finds.  Hire a unit that tells you there's a deposit below a specific spot.  Infallibly, although the amount of oil is completely random.

    Even M.U.L.E. had assaying.  Geographic information is a closely guarded corporate secret, with scanning technology and the ability to put various public and proprietary data together into a useful whole to determine a good drill spot provide game play, upgrade paths, and player differentiation.

    High stakes negotiations with landholders to determine lease costs.  This includes clauses such as minimum production targets, as well as land use restrictions  (can't drill near the farmhouse)
    [b]Turmoil[/b]
    Buy land for a set rate, or 'outbid' another player by paying the current rate + X$  (remember, you're doing this largely blind.
    [b]What's missing[/b]
    Players are currently bidding on the next property based on identical costs and perfect information.  There's no risk/reward, no 'I know something you don't' about bidding, and no 'my tech means I can get oil out of this property better than you'  Even delaying the announcement of total oil on other players land by a turn (and/or limiting that information to what they actually got) would create a more interesting bidding space.  Is that low number a sign that the other player is bad, or that there wasn't anything to find?  Did they get lucky and find all the oil early and close to the surface, or is it a good spot to drill?


[h1]Drilling[/h1]
    [b]Reality:[/b]
    Complicated process involving drilling long distances while monitoring a variety of readouts to determine the status of a drillbit 1000s of feet under the surface, including where exactly underground you are and what you're drilling through.
    [b]Turmoil[/b]
    Click to drill your pipe to a specific location, including twists and turns
    [b]What's missing[/b]
    This one isn't so bad, although exploratory drilling could be more interesting/informative

[h1]Production[/h1]
    [b]Reality[/b]
    Lots of stuff comes out of the ground.  It needs to be managed, processed and routed correctly.  Wells are either pumped or naturally flowing based on positive pressure.  Should the well be produced (oil extracted) or shut in to build up pressure (for greater flow later).  Water or gas can be injected to increase pressure.  Pumped wells often burn oil or gas coming from the well to power themselves.  Lease requirements mean a certain amount of production must be maintained.
    [b]Turmoil[/b]
    Wells flow until empty, but make sure the oil is being hauled away or else it'll blow!
    [b]What's missing[/b]
    Risk/Reward for maximizing a well's production, the value of production now vs. over time.

[h1]Sales[/h1]
    [b]Reality[/b]
    This one may be anachronistic, but in addition to price differentials, different purchasers have different quantities they'll accept on a given day.
    [b]Turmoil[/b]
    Time management game determining which to sell to vs. cost of storage.
    [b]What's missing[/b]
    I really like the cost of storage vs. sales now, except so far as it is a timed map and you've got to sell everything at the end.  That seems just silly.  Making sure the wagons go to the higher price, though, is time management in the worst way.  Anachronistic, but the cost of a pipeline (faster, cheaper movement of oil) vs trucking (or wagons) is another good decision point.

[h1]Shut in[/h1]
    [b]Reality[/b]
    All wells continue to produce as long as it is viable to operate them.  This involves balancing ongoing costs with the perception of a wells future profitability.  Lease requirements play into this, and there is a significant cost involved in shutting a well down.
    [b]Turmoil[/b]
    You have a few months to a year to drill for oil in a spot.  Regardless of your rigs, your lease is up at the end of the year, and you lose anything that's left unsold.  Risk/reward is entirely based around 'will I have time to make this back if I spend it now'
    [b]What's missing[/b]
    This is the weakest part of the game (imho).  It turns the game into a rush rush rush time management sim rather than allowing the player to focus on serious risk/reward decisions, like if I drill here, how much oil will I get, and will that be enough to pay for the drilling.  Is it worth drilling another well to maintain the lease, even if the well isn't likely to produce much?


Basically, this is a time management game.  The risk reward decisions are all there, but they are forced by artificial and silly time limits rather than likely profits.  In addition, several opportunities to allow players to develop unique strategies (find the best oil fields,  produce the oil efficiently, manage land efficiently, etc) are missed.

I'd like to see this game improve, but as long as it's leaning so heavily on time managment tropes, I'm going to stay away.

I spent a good amount of time to get there, and now i'm expected to start again? Bring in the steam achievements, and maybe even some trading cards for me to play it again. Despite this, it still is a good game to play, and if I had to rate it with what happened, I would probably rate it as a 3 of 5. The first star would be earned through the fun gameplay and campaign that you play through. The second star would have to be for the graphics, the game looks great overall. And the 3rd star would be that the game is good for people who like to build/adapt to different enviroments with the same overall layout ( ex: oil/rocks are in different places/depths every map ). Now, that being said, I should probably say why this game loses 2 stars. The first reason would probably be, that as soon as you cap the upgrades, that's it, there's nothing better. This partially halts the gameplay, making it impossible to get any better. The second star that this game loses would probably be that it gets repetitive as you go on.

It's quite a fun game, but it only took 2 hours before I was able to buy all the upgrades, but i believe a lot can be done to expand the lifetime of the game.

Underground gas layers, which would explode if the player just bores directly into it. It would make the process of reaching the oil harder, because the only thing the player needs to think about atm, is when to sell the oil and when not to.

Bandits could attack and try to steal from you, requiring you to hire cowboys to protect you.

You should be able to dig deeper, way, way, way deeper than what is possible now: place small oil depots in the upper layers of the ground and force the player to dig through and down stone (gas?) and other obstacles in order to reach the  big oil depots. In addition: you should be able to scroll up and down, it is annoying you have to wait for the months to pass by before you can reach the oil depots which is outside of the screen while dowsers constantly whistles at you :P

The first map i played was overflown with oil, but the next to maps had almost nothing. It would be better if the oil varies on a single map, sp for an example 5 lands with good oil laid clustered and then lands with very little oil laid clustered aswell. would make more sense with bidding on the land, as the AI atm pays ridicules prices for the piece of land, which is closet to the town. Would be a new option of bribing, could hire someone to provide information about a few lands. It could be: between 50-80, below 60, over 50... and so on

A multiplayer mode where you compete against each other. You could compete on a map with different game lengths example: 16-36 pieces of land you would have to bid on. Here there is a lot of options aswell, you could bribe to to disadvanteges  for the other players or you could hire bandits to sabotage etc.

This game is working great for an early access. Just some details and a bit more content could make it better.

I have some advice for developers (Hope they read it):

- It'll be nice to have a kind of stock market or a trade place to make the player motivated to still earn money. Because if you bought all upgrades there is no use for it any more. (Or at least the option for a high score overview)

- The finance report is bad. To big and actually not that easy to understand... As well it'll be nice to see the report at main menue; like a high score botton!

- In the game under the left inc. and the right inc. the bottons feel a little to big for my taste. I know it's good to control via touch screen, but sometimes I can't select the pipe to build there.

- If I play with a resolution less than 1600 x ... the bottons over the oil pump, to uprade those, are in the interface. It's just a bit annoying...

- I don't like the map because it feels like I play a browser game... As well it's easy to make the ai to spend its money for the land parcels. And to scroll will be better with the right mouse botton.

- In town: More upgrades and maybe buildings to buy.

- In game screen: More depth, maybe water which can make the oil dilute and useless..., the diffrence between scanner upgrades is to low, the horse upgrade to see how many wagons you have is not good - should be there from the beginning.

I recommend this game to anyone who likes economic-strategy-games. For its size it's quite looking good.
Nice work and thanks a lot.

manegeing supply demand with wagon and pipes is a challange, if you play aggresive then you might all the oil in the map and cash in from compelting before the time limit, but the pibes are not laid effeciently(longer pipes also cost more to upgrade) and it will cost you, ot you use the seach ability and find the oil slowly but surely and save a lot of money but you might hit the time limit and not get all the oil.
AND you have to keep an eye on the price, and stockpiles so you do't waste oil.

it is fun, it just need some more music, i got bored of hearing the same tunes for the 2 hours straight i played.

I seldom buy relativly simple made Indy-titles (this one has only about 30MB) for almost full price (""only"" 10% discount at the moment). There are regulary enough AAA-titles for this amount of money or less, but I desperatly miss the 80s-title ""Oil Empire"", and so I gave it a chance. Of course it is not the same, but fr me, the feeling of this game here comes close (at least for me). So I would definely say: the money was well spent. 

Some suggestions for further game-improvement, would be: 

1) A better AI during the land auctions. Of course, properties with explored rich oilfields nearby should be more attractive. But the differences on chance are not explaining, why the AI is sometimes willing to spend much more money than the competioners for a piece of land right next to it (and loosing too much hard earned money by doing so). The AI seems to extract quite at a good rate, but then spends too much money in this situation and falling back in the ranking. 

2) I have so far no idea, what the AI is doing outside the auctions. There seems to be no information, how the AI-competitioners are earning their money. The amount they earn, could as well be randomly generated. Or how they spend it (except for buying their piece of land). So I discovered no information about their strategies with technology and everything else. Also their little background-story is not making clear, if there are any differences in the NPC-strategies at all. I would like to have some more information about them and ... 

3) I would like to interact with my NPC competitioners. How about robbery, espionage, sabotage, ... Of course combined with meaningful consequences for victims (like broken pipes or leaking tanks) and caught evil-doers (like shortened extraction time because of short inprisonment and so on). This could involve strategy-aspects in town and on the region map as well as little mini-games.

So finaly, I would say: Nice game, worth the money, whith a solid core-concept in a sadly unterrepresented genre, with fitting graphics and a nice simple background-music. But also with a lot of chances, to get even better. But there is already much more, than just the infamous early-access-""potential"".

The lets player frustrated me so much with all of their mistakes, that I felt compelled to buy it and make things right.
Low price, and actually fairly fun. No bugs. Well polished.
Wouldn't say it's skyrim with guns, but it's definately something to play if you're bored and have the money.
