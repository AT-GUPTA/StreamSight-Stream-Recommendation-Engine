There were few issues while starting up and with the audio, but there are plenty of community guides that helped me fix them.

The game itself if amazing and I'm going to be shocked if the others are better than this. Arkham Asylum itself is interesting to explore with incredible atmosphere and well designed areas if the map. You are free to experiment in combat encounters, which are not overly complex but enjoyable, with the numerous batman gadgets you unlock. The writing so far is amazing, with tons of the best batman villains incorporated really well given the Asylum setting and some of the best voice acting I've heard in video games. R.I.P Kevin.

On top of all this, the fact the game was released in 2009 is insane as it holds up incredibly 15 years later!

The story and characters are really fleshed out. The combat with it's freeflow approach is still challening to keep up your combo. Overall it packs some truly fun gameplay elements and has fanatastic voice talent. Rocksteady nailed what Batman is supposed to feel like.

I started playing it because of all the reviews of Suicide squad killed the Justice League or awful and people were saying play this instead. Oh what a good decision to play this instead. And I've checked out the steam charts and more people are playing this game that's 11 years old versus the Suicide squad. Suicide squad because they partnered with Sweet Baby Inc is dying on the vine. They had to tear down Batman and all the superheroes in that game for the agenda.

But after watching a couple of people play it on twitch and on YouTube. It's not a good game.

This game however excels I had a whole lot of fun doing it and unlike the last time I played it I didn't get all the Riddler trophies.

Everything from the visuals to the audio to the dialogue are all excellent. The performances of the two leads are fantastic, the story and ambiance are very good, and perhaps most notably, the combat system is a lot of fun.

This game is right up there with the original Gears of War and Resident Evil 4 as one of the most innovative games of the 2000s. It introduces so many clever gameplay mechanics, the combat has depth to it (later emulated in the excellent Sleeping Dogs), and it's just a fun game. The use of gadgets is also pretty fun, although there are so many of them, and some I never used.

You can see just how much effort went into every aspect of Arkham Asylum, with the art design and even with all the character bios and audio tapes. It's just a really impressive game. And the Riddler secrets are actually fun enough that I went through and collected all 240 of them.

I also appreciate the game's length. You can probably power through the story in 12 hours, but it's realistically a 15-20 hour game for most people, which is a good length for this. It doesn't overstay its welcome.

The one major criticism I have is the level design. It looks beautiful (especially for a 14 year old game), but some of the levels are mazes that can be a real pain to traverse, especially after you've finished the story and are going back for the Riddler secrets. Finding all the sealed doors and remembering all the alternate paths to get around the Caves and the Medical Facility can be a real annoyance.

Also, while I enjoy the Detective Mode mechanic, sometimes I felt the game wanted you to use it too much, which caused a FOMO because it masks the game's excellent visuals and art design.

All in all, this game is a classic. I'm giving it a 90%, but I would have given it a 95% if it had not been for the maze-like level design.

Highly recommended.

[i](Disclaimer:  I'm no stranger to the Arkham series up until Knight, having plugged in time on a PS3 prior to this review - Please don't take my time here as gospel!)[/i]

Batman: Arkham.  Hoo, boy.  Rocksteady, fellas, [b]what happened to you?[/b]  Well, here goes nothing I guess.

In this game, we play as esteemed hero Man, taking his arch-enemy, the Jonkler, to Arkham Aslume for treatment.  The problem is, Jonkler jonked himself loose in a take-over of the entire facility, and I'm cutting those stupid memes out going forth.  Long story short; Joker has broken out of DC's least secure prison, taken the entire place over, and it's up to you to put an end to his plans before he does as Joker does best.

From there, the madhouse embodies that term as literally as possible, with Batman having to face down rogue after rogue in a story that feels like it could be lifted straight from the comics.

Gameplay-wise, well let's just say there's a [i]reason[/i] that 'Arkham-esqe' became a standard for open world combat, and that this series is why.  Your combat is free-flowing, as enemies begin working up the nerve to hit the friggin' Bat.  What can begin as rough-hewn combos consisting of basic attacks strung together can become a ballet of dodges, counters, attacks, gadgets, and finishing moves all strewn together near-seamlessly.  Getting into the system is easy enough - It's mastery where the challenge lies.

There's also stealthy 'predator' sections, where you're against gun-toting enemies, who can shred you to Bat-paste within moments and forces you to consider your stealthy options instead, from using gargoyles to your advantage, to stealth ambushes, to using your gadgets in conjunction to better control crowds.

When you aren't introducing the cowardly, superstitious lot to your fists, you're exploring the island via running, jumping, sliding, gliding, grappling, and using your gadgets as exploration devices.  Your Batarangs might be good in combat to soften someone up, but they can also remotely trigger switches, for instance.  The Batclaw can be used to quickly grab enemies, sure, but it can also yank out vent covers.  Explosive Gel can be used to detonate weak walls just as easily as it can be used to knock your foes unsteady, provided you have the mythical [b]prep time[/b] that Batman can use to become Bat-God.  The standout feature of puzzle-solving is 'Detective Mode', which shades the world in blue and highlights elements of puzzles, lights enemies up like Christmas trees, and helps you realize how much you miss color.

Speaking of; Game's muted in color.  Now, this is very old hardware we're talking about here - By this point, I'm pretty sure any PC can run Arkham by now, to say nothing of dedicated gaming rigs - And yeah, I can't and won't judge the experience's graphics on pure fidelity.  When you are talking about a game that released almost fifteen years ago, you kind of need to give it's graphical fidelity some slack.  What I will say is that in terms of the spirit of DC Comics, this game captures it.  Rocksteady evidently got into the comics and read a fair few Arkham-related stories, and used those stories to shape their take on the iconic island and the rogues gallery.

No multiplayer.  No problem.

In terms of replay value, Arkham generally doesn't have much in the main game - Most of the replayability is sequestered into it's challenge modes, small gauntlets and challenges laden with enemies for you to fight, perfect for training yourself or simply having a little more fun with the game.

Would I recommend Man: Arkham Aslume?  I would, yeah.  It still holds up nearly 15 years later as being one of the best Batman games released, one of the best DC games ever released, and kickstarted a series that only escalated and, for the most part, only got better with every installment.",1708580298,1708580298,True,1,0,0.493273556232452393,0,True,False,False

Batman Arkham Asylum give its players an immersive adventure into an action-packed, gritty, chaotic night of the caped crusader's life. The story of this game is simple but bursting with exciting turns. Batman is locked inside the Arkham Asylum, the iconic correctional facility for criminally insane near-do-wells. Loose inside the asylum are a large number of Batman's iconic villains, each with their own dastardly plans for Gotham City and the Dark Knight. Batman must fight for his life and city trapped with the hulking Bane, the bewitching Poison Ivy, the mind bending Scarecrow, and Joker, the mastermind behind the entire jailbreak.

The combat is rudimentary in comparison to its immediate predecessor Arkham City. I had played Arkham City before Asylum, and could feel the immediate difference. Asylum's Batman is slower, heavier, but still maintains a fair amount of variety that leaves players with options. Asylum's enemies also have their iconic horde variety; with armoured opponents, armed opponents, titanic opponents, and of course sheer numbers.

The boss battles of Batman are underwhelming. The simple use of one or two gadgets to stun them followed by mashing the attack button, leaving these villains looking like insidious and dangerous maniacs, and more like inhabitants of a Zelda dungeon. This simple boss design is supplementary by minion combat, which is the far more engaging experience, and does increase the difficulty and overall enjoyment of the boss fights. This does not negate the issue of boss battles however.

The predator combat system is a unique experience, similar to the likes of Assassin's Creed or Dishonoured. Using cover, grates, and gargoyles, you survey hostile environments, pick your targets, and can choose to silently take them out, or go loud and draw attention to a certain spot as you disappear back into the shadows. The dialogue of minions as you pick them off one by one is a great rush, as you truly feel yourself acting the part of a legend that crime fears.

But whilst the rush of swiftly taking out armed thugs is exhilarating, the threat of retaliation is very real. The damage dealt by armed enemies, makes the need for stealth and quick take downs very clear. The Batman might be a legend that criminals cower from, but beneath the mask, there truly is a man. And behind the controller is a player. This game does an excellent job of punishing mistakes in both combat and predator encounters. As the damage dealt by a goon with bat, breaks your combo (and flow) and the damage of guns is just as frightening. You need to play smart, careful, and quick, which makes every aspect of combat incredibly engaging.

The Asylum is not just a single building, but an entire island of facilities that contribute to the incarceration and attempting healing of Gotham's lunatics. Batman's traversal options, allow you to cover the island grounds with ease, however the interior level designs leave little in the way of shortcuts, which make backtracking for collectables and certain missions slightly irritating. Similarly the exterior is segmented into three section, none of which are particularly large, which leaves very little excitement after an initial playthrough. 

This is a rather minor flaw however, as this adventure is designed to be entirely linear to experience. There are no side missions in Arkham Asylum, unlike its sequels. Riddler provides the only side content to the game's story mode, through riddles, trophies, and the secrets of Amodeus Arkham. Completing Riddler's challenges certainly isn't a neccessity, but it the resulting lore bits and defeat of enigmatic egomaniac are satisfying enough to reccomend taking it on.

Outside of the story and the Asylum are the challenges. Timed encounters that test your skill in combat mode and creativity in predator mode. Unlocking three medals in each challenge is a rewarding experience and a great way to hone your skills outside of the story if you feel like challenging yourself with higher difficulty enemies.

As said at the beginning, Batman Arkham Asylum was the start of a genre defining series. It has all the hard edges and clunky starts of most gaming innovations, but its adventure is action packed, its characters engaging, its challenges are rewarding to accomplish, and you come away truly feeling like the Batman.",1708518016,1708518016,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I got back into achievement hunting after earning a platinum trophy on my PS4 in Spider-Man.  Shortly before finishing that game, we took on a roommate who is a Batman guy.  I came in from work one day while he was playing one of the Arkham games (I don’t recall which) and we chatted about what he was doing as he was doing it.  I said, “so this is basically Batman’s version of Spider-Man’s game?”  He said they weren’t quite the same, but they’re similar enough I might enjoy it.  Now again, I’m not really into super heroes, but Batman is the coolest of the DC bunch.  The Arkham series wasn’t on my radar before this moment, but it was afterward.

The controls make sense, but they aren’t intuitive for someone whose favorite games include Spider-Man and the Yakuza series.  I really struggled with combat for the first several hours.  Something finally clicked, and I can string together 30-hit combos fairly consistently, but I absolutely lucked into the combo where I managed to string together a 57-move combo using all of Batman’s moves.  I’m mad that I’ll probably never repeat that feat again.  The key here is patience—Batman doesn’t like to be rushed.  What billionaire does?  I used a DualShock 4 to play this one, like always.  I also have a PS4 copy of the game, and I got my feet wet with that.  If I had to guess, it took me around 35 hours between the two versions for that click with combat.  (7/10)

Graphics are good.  I’ll admit the remaster on PS4 is much better, but the original version is solid.  I think this game is much nicer to look at than several others of the era, such as Assassin’s Creed or Dishonored.  The Steam port retains the original graphics.  Some areas were incredibly dark, but not impossible to complete.  I tend to spend a lot of time in detective mode, so switching back and forth can be disorienting sometimes.  It’s not so bad that I couldn’t handle it, and I don’t consider it detrimental to the experience.  (7/10)

Usually, music is one of my favorite parts of a game.  With this game, it’s good, but it doesn’t always have the oomph I need.  The little melodies interlaced throughout Arkham Island are interesting and very Batman-esque, but I feel like more could be done.  The sound effects on the other hand, are robust.  The wind whipping off Batman’s cape as he glides is easily one of my favorite instances in the game of immersion. (7/10)

I once wondered in my review of Lego Batman: The Videogame why all these villains were running amok in Gotham City.  Arkham Asylum shows you the why right off the Bat (hehe).  Joker is painted to be the absolutely diabolical mastermind he deserves to be, and it’s incredibly compelling.  I loved seeing enemies I’m not familiar with, such as Killer Croc, and a few fan favorites make a return, like Poison Ivy.  The little character biographies were a cool touch, and finding the interview tapes scattered across the island gave more insight into the plot.  Rounding all this out, I still wish to know more about Amadeus Arkham, and I hope more mystery surrounding him is available to unravel in the later installments of the series.  (10/10)

Finally, the extra content in the form of challenges was interesting to explore and sharpen skills with.  I did well with the stealth challenges initially, but I’m not sure finishing hard mode would’ve been doable for me without that extra practice.  Also, screw Shock and Awe.  I never want to play that one again.  (8/10)

Overall, this game helped me better appreciate the character that is Batman, and I can connect more with the love for the character my husband and sons have.  I will definitely play the later games in the series, and I may rewatch the animated series with my older son to get a better feel for certain characters.  Walking into the game with only a passing interest in Batman and walking away with an increased appreciation is enough for me to absolutely recommend the game.

(This is not just my machines, this is a common bug you can find footage of) If you can get past these things you'll have a great time with it. My main criticisms with the actual gameplay, are that it doesn't have a mini map, but this is more immersive. Granted, with a metroidvania it gets hard to find your way without pausing in some areas, due to the fact there are a lot of winding corridors. Main story you won't get lost, but for finding collectibles you'll have to check the map a lot. There is a tool you use where you have to mash a button/key a lot before it works, this part hasn't aged well either. But those small blemishes aside I fully recommend this game to Batman, Comic book, or Metroidvania fans.",1708333333,1708333333,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat is simplistic yet busted. Countering enemy attacks don't seem to work while in mid combat, you can get interrupted and take damage while dealing a finisher, enemies shoot more frequently. 

Even the boss fights are repetitive. Oh, you fought Bane? Now you'll fight two or three of him, or here's a twist, you fight multiple of them and after you take a bit of their health, more enemies show up. Such rubbish.

The story is functional and quite engaging, with comedy, mystery, and elements of horror. The side mystery of the Spirit of Arkham is worth the time completing for the story it tells through the audio logs, and the riddles from the Riddler are quite engaging to solve as well.

The presentation is top notch: the graphics are fantastic for 2009, and the art direction is the perfect comic book blend of over the top accents on a grounded setting. The music is fitting for all situations, and every character is a visual treat: Joker, Batman, Harley, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, even the generic henchmen look idealized physically. 

The gadgets are quite good for the most part. I found the sonic Batarang to rarely be useful, but every other tool felt uniquely qualified for different combat and traversal challenges.

I have one major gripe: the invisible ""lock-on"" system that the game uses during combat. Due to the game not having a clear indicator of which enemy you are latched on to, you can press the parry button when an enemy is trying to attack you, and instead of parrying the enemy, you parry thin air, then take damage. This is a rare occurrence, but happened often enough for me to notice and for it to bother me. Unfortunately, this effect is exaggerated in the game's two spectacle boss fights. The camera is moved to a mostly static position at the back of the arena, and enemies are spawned in. For some reason, the lock on seems very unreliable for beginning targeting an enemy or for switching enemies in these two encounters. My final other gripe is the inconsistency of immunity when using the ""Instant Takedown"" upgrades when in encounters with Titan Henchmen. When using an ""Instant Takedown"" in normal Henchmen combat, the other Henchmen wait for the take-down animation to complete before attacking you, incentivizing the player to keep their combo meter going so that they can continue to use the ""Instant Takedown."" However, when a group of Henchmen is accompanied by a Titan Henchman, the Titan Henchman isn't given the same AI change when ""Instant Takedown"" is used, meaning that in mixed fights, it is actually more dangerous to use an ""Instant Takedown"" than to run in circles around the arena until the Titan Henchman charges, allowing for you manage the fight. It simply leads to a greater feeling of tedium.

Overall, however, this is a fantastic game. Challenge maps are not my thing, but there are plenty in this game, and if they are at the same level of quality as the base game, I imagine they are fantastic if that is your thing!

It's been over a decade since this game released yet it only feels like it came out three years ago, it's [i]that[/i] good. The graphics are amazing for a 2009 release and still looks great now, but graphics aren't much if the game itself isn't very fun.

Fortunately, it is. The combat system is an excellent example of easy to learn, hard to master while rewarding players that master how they work as higher combo chains grant extra XP you can use to unlock upgrades. You cannot just button mash through this game so some element of skill is required, but you don't need every single combat skill to finish it either. Dodge rolls were especially helpful when dealing with large crowds of enemies at once.

This game came out during a time where Quick Time Events (QTEs) were a very common inclusion in a lot of other games, which was something I've never liked as they either break immersion during cutscenes or over-simplify what could've been fun action set-pieces during gameplay. Fortunately, Batman Arkham Asylum does not include a single QTE whatsoever which I really appreciate.

Some portions of the game require stealth to get through, usually by eliminating every single foe in the area without letting any of them see you. The detective mode allows you to easily see enemies in the area even if they're through walls or blend in with the environment, making these sections not nearly as frustrating as they would be in other games.

There's more than enough production values to make this game feel like an interactive movie at times and there is a rather lengthy walking segment at the beginning, but once you get past the prologue, there aren't many cutscenes to interfere with gameplay so it still feels like a proper video game; the story, dialogue and atmosphere is just the icing on the cake.

Batman Arkham Asylum plays like a Metroidvania of sorts. Certain collectables can only be obtained after acquiring powerups through story progression. While you don't need to explore previous areas to finish the main story, you're still encouraged to do so as you also gain extra XP by finding these secrets throughout the island.

The bosses are easily the weakest part of the game, however. The fight against Bane is decent enough; the problem is that almost every boss in the game plays out just like it so they do get a bit repetitive after a while. Even the final boss was a huge letdown compared to everything else this game does so well. Fortunately, there aren't that many bosses so it doesn't hinder my enjoyment of the game too much.

If you're tired of the main story and are looking for more stuff to do, the challenge maps will put all your stealth and combat skills to the ultimate test. Up to three medals can be earned in each one and getting them all can be quite difficult though some are also a bit frustrating. None of them are very long, but fully mastering each one can take a lot of practice. The GOTY Edition also includes all the DLC challenge maps which there's 4 of, but sadly no playable Joker which is PS3 exclusive content.

The PC port is fantastic and I would easily recommend it even to those that already played it on console. The PS3/360 versions only run at 30FPS while on PC, it can run at 60FPS if your computer can handle it. I did not run into any major issues when playing this game and it works really well with an XBOX One controller, though keyboard and mouse support exists if you don't want to use a controller.

This game felt like it was made for Batman fans as they really do feel like Batman himself as they experience the story and immerse themselves in the world they play in, almost as if the creators of this game were true Batman fans. However, this isn't just a great Batman game for fans of the series - even those who aren't Batman fans but still enjoy great action games can sit down, play and enjoy it just fine.

A very easy recommendation from me, overall. This game frequently goes on sale so you can score a great deal on this masterpiece, but even at the regular asking price, it's well worth the money and especially your time.",1708164237,1708164237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, it wasn't hard to complete and I believe most would complete it within this time.

 .Kevin Conroy nails it as Batman again, Mark Hamill will forever be the best Joker in my humble opinion. This game is so worth playing it. 5/5",1708126458,1708126458,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would say this is a very comics based game. By that I mean that everything from the story to presentation to world design is super bombastic and full of spectacle while also being quite simplistic. The game definitely aged and it is not as refined as Arkham City is.

Overall the story is good and all the main villains make an appearance however none of them get the time to truly get flashed out. Bosses are quite gimmicky and it is annoying to have to back track through an empty map throughout the story. It is also quite short it only took me 9 hours to beat the game though that probably feels appropritate.

Overall the game definitely feels its age and I would have to sadly say that it is my least favorite in the mainline trilogy. City and Knight are just so much better in every single way that I cant help but feel that this game is skippable. If you never played this game do not feel like this is a must play however it is still good and worth it for the price.",1708123951,1708123951,True,0,0,0.496831774711608887,0,True,False,False

This is to say, action ""games of the year"" which are put on a pedestal because of one or two new ideas they brought to the table, which later become industry standards or, if you prefer, are copied over and over. Yet, on retrospect, these games were also very half baked and inconsistent as a whole, even at the time they were originally released. Just like Batman when he was crippled by his enemy Bane, Arkham Asylum was broken in the spine by a general lack of polish, bad script and irritating voice actors. Go past the strengths of this game, and your enjoyment will largely depend on your emotional investment to the main character, and your willingness to forgive the game's faults. And no, its age is not an excuse.

The entire game is set in Arkham, a psychiatric asylum for the demented criminals in costume that Batman fights in the comics. Despite the game world being limited in scale, it has outdoor as well as indoor areas, and you can retrace your steps in order to look for all the collectables you can pick. Some of the areas have very good texture work and art, but not all... and the game tends to look older than it really is when the visuals aren't that good. But you aren't on Arkham for vacation, and all sorts of goons and costumed psychos roam free inside its walls. Luckily, combat against them is satisfying. Although simple in mechanics, requiring just the press of one button for all the fists and kicks, it still allows your bulky version of Batman to fight lots of enemies at the same time, and perform a wide array of moves and evasion acrobatics. Its not unlike the old Bruce Lee and kung-fu movies. The combat system of the Arkham series has, in fact, become the standard in modern superhero games.

However, outside its combat, the game will fail to capture your attention in the same way. The story, centered on the (very overused) Joker character of the Batman mythos, is very non sensical and resembles the ""over-the-top"" kind of tone from a sunday cartoon, not having much in common with the mature, dark and psychological storylines that the issues of the comic strip were known for. Only in the campiest sense, the characters and voices are well achieved. Not great, just good. That said, the Joker character (voiced by Mark Hamill) is very central to the game, and he gets the most lines of dialogue. Having to constantly listen to a Joker who, not only is very badly written but is also mocking Batman through the comm for almost the entire playthrough, becomes almost unbearable as the game goes on. Honestly I ended up hating Hamill, and enjoyed the game the most when his stupid script was on pause.

I wish that the other characters were better written too, with less camp and more grit. The villains of comicbook Batman, despite being costumed like bad guys from other superhero comics, are actually proxies for real world mental disease, evil and psychopathy. Batman is essentially different as a character, in that his stories like to pretend that they happen in its own universe with a more realistic, pulp and gritty flavor, separate from those flying heroes with super powers. His stories aren't standard superhero narratives, they can be anything and may range from slasher horror, crime fiction, detective misteries, or even the paranormal. Consistent with that, the villains in this game should probably leave a greater degree of real life feel than they do in this game. And even if we forgive this mistake, and decide to stick only with the gameplay, this aspect also has a couple of problems...

Batman has two sight modes, normal and ""detective"". The last one allows the player to highlight interactive items and enemies. The problem is, there is no time limitation while you're using this mode, so the temptation to leave it on for the entire game, in order to not miss anything, is high. All the colors turn blue when we turn the mode on. This means that in practice, and for most of the game, you'll see the graphics through an ugly blue filter... not to mention that a couple of areas have a very blocky, very square architecture. Not great to look at, honestly; they seem like coming straight from a Playstation 1 or 2 game. Mechanically, your character has limited moves too: you have a grapling hook, but no button to truly jump over obstacles on demand like in true platform games. You have to use the hook for everything. It doesn't feel natural, neither the animations which contribute to your character looking very stiff as it walks around. But even in terms of the challenge to the player skill, Arkham is inconsistent: it is very easy on normal difficulty. But on hard, it can be very hard. There's no middle ground. And still, the stealth sequences are always very disappointing, and dead easy, regardless of your chosen difficulty. I view this as one of the critical gameplay problems in Arkham Asylum, because if you add stealth into your game, you have to make sure its done correctly. Lousy stealth mecanics can really lower the standards of a game, and I think that's precisely what happened here.

I don't totally regret buying Arkham Asylum, because before Rocksteady, the developer, came to the scene there weren't too many games in the market using the Batman license. If we overlook its presentation and gameplay problems, Arkham Asylum can still be enjoyable at times. Enjoyable, never great. However, be warned that the hype was always high with this game, and if you pay too much attention to it, you may quit your playing in utter disappointment. Arkham Asylum is in many aspects just a normal game, a mediocre game, not worthy of being selected as GOTY back in its day. Its highest merit was to open the way to the later, and much better, games in this franchise... and also serving as inspiration to the also newer, and outstanding, ""Marvel's Spider-Man""... a polish work over the Arkham formula, but truly deserving each one of the critical acclaims and the hype it got.",1707531623,1707937360,False,1,0,0.447368413209915161,1,True,False,False

The date tells you that this is indeed the first batman game in arkham universe. Honestly, the graphics are still up to par with modern games. A satisfying combat experience for me, both exploration wise and boss wise.

Probably an important question that people may wonder: ""Can i enjoy this game even though I know nothing about batman?"" short answer, yes. Though this game is to make the DC fans hyped when meeting their favorite villain or characters, there really isn't any lore dumping that only fans understand. If anything, this is newcomer friendly! So don't worry about getting lost in the story, because they focus more on about the lore/story of Batman: Arkham Asylum and not the entire Batman lore!

The game isn't about combat action, there's easy puzzle, collectibles, challenges (from riddler) that makes the game isn't 100% completed just because you finished the story.

There are plenty memorable boss fight that really gets you, the hardest difficulty isn't that hard for me.


I'm personally are the type of player who wants to 100% everything, or pretty much around 90% done with the game. So really, collectibles are what gets this game hard to beat 100%.

Story building is very nice, each boss fight is unique, never repetitive.

It can run a little rough on some modern hardware, but the NVIDIA PhysX are absolutely stunning in this game, especially being as early as it is with that. I had a couple crashes, and the resolution seemed to insist on not quite fitting my monitor's resolution no matter how I set it, but aside from those set-backs, the game itself still holds up. I'd played it before on PS3, and on PC it's still an amazing game with a brilliant voice-cast, and and excellent story, with a Legend of Zelda/Metroid formula of returning to places with new gadgets to get the super secret things that'll give you a little bonus XP/story.

Here is my review of Batman: Arkham Asylum.

[h2]Story[/h2]
Although it took me 18, I'm sure that the story can be beaten in about 12 to 14 hrs. As someone already said the plot of Arkham Asylum is like a typical Batman Tuesday. And I don't have much else to say. Basically Batman is trapped on the island and has to stop Joker(who's got special drugs this time) teamed up with some others classic Dark Knight's villains.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
Not as rafined as in later installations, but still fairly good. Also the further you get in the story, your enemies will use new tactics or equipment to even their chances with Batman. And you can have gadgets as well - 5 obtainable through playing the main story and 3 additional, that you get from upgrades. Stealth segments are stellar, too. There is one big disadvantage to Asylum -  the lack of replayablity after you beat the game. Other than that, everything is great

[h2]Combat[/h2]
One word - smooth. The Arkham games are known for their excellent combat. And Asylum paved the way for that. The enemies are fine. It's always nice to throw some thugs and twist their arms or legs. About the bosses... They're also fine, 2 of them are amazing imo, but the final boss sucks.

[h2]Collectibles[/h2]
There are no side missions in this game, but we have 3 types of collectibles: Riddler's trophies, Arkham's chronicles and interview tapes. The last ones are propably my favorite, since they give insight to many Batman's villains.
Riddler's trophies obviously count to the Riddler's challenge, which consists of 240 tasks(or rather riddles) to complete.


TL;DR-story is your average Batman night, gameplay is great, combat is great and you have puzzles too.

With 70% completion and 133/240 riddles(as for the time of writing this review), I can say that Batman: Arkham Asylum deserves the praise it gets. It can be both challenging and tricky, but also engaging and fun. If you ask me, the game is worth it's price, but if you're still unsure, you can wait for a small discount. Overall, a solid [b]8.5/10[/b]. I definitely recommend you to play it.",1703521481,1707304651,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But that's its greatest strength in my book, the story is tight and focused without a ton of side missions to distract me, the environment is detailed and haunting, and it just gets everything right in tone about the post post DKR Batman we have now.

Just turning off the lights and setting up the room with the right ambience made for an awesome playthrough. 

I recently got back into Arkham Knight and felt like replaying the whole series, something I usually avoid because I find it hard to get back into older games once I've seen better graphics, like with the 'Uncharted' series. But, this game still holds up really well. Even 15 years later, the combat feels just as good, the story still grabs you, and the graphics, while not top-notch by today's standards, are still pretty decent.

Seriously, Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy both have/had amazing voices (R.I.P the Batman), along with the voices of Harley, Gordon, Riddler, and others. The gameplay is the biggest reason why I got so into it, all the actions and movements flow so well. It's a bit clunky at times, but the underlying concepts and mechanics behind it is great.

Even though it released all the way back in 2009 as someone's first time playing in 2022 (13 YEARS LATER) I can gladly say with full 100% confidence its still a phenomenal game. 

Both gameplay and story is like an action-packed thrill ride that holds up as the gold standard for third-person action-adventure games (at least in my opinion.)  Story isn't a total 10/10 top-tier masterpiece, more of a 9/10 comic-book tale but still satisfying from beginning to end and gameplay more than makes up for it. 

Best part of this game is without a doubt the combat, its so brutal yet flows together so well that anyone can pick up, and don't even get me started on the stealth sections! And the harder difficulties certainly push your skills to the test, which makes it even better!

All in all 10/10 certified masterpiece - This game really is incredible and deserves the praise.

    [tr]
        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The game still holds up pretty well, even by today’s standards. The gritty atmosphere of Arkham Asylum is really immersive and has an incredible level design. The attention to detail is also pretty impressive. A good example of this is that the further you get into the game, Batman’s suit gets more damaged and worn out. The graphics may not blow you away, but overall it’s a solid looking game with a dark atmosphere that many will enjoy.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The game has many good gameplay mechanics. Hand to hand combat is the bread and butter in terms of fighting. It’s the perfect easy to learn/hard to master mechanic that keeps you wanting more and more action. Batman can move really quick while in combat as well (surprising for his size). You will get many visual prompts telling you when to counter or do a special attack. It’s really fun and I never get bored of it. Scoring a high combo without getting hit is incredibly satisfying. Batman has many gadgets to use on his foes. The batarang is one of many you can use! Through leveling up, you can increase your skill and even unlock new abilities. The leveling system felt balanced and had good pacing, not feeling grindy or annoying to go through. The stealth mechanics are fantastic. Hiding in the shadows and above to knockout your enemies and hearing their buddies' reactions is so immersive and fun! The  developers really nailed down stealth in this game. You also have many collectables and will even unlock character bios to learn more from the characters in the game. The cool thing about the characters bio, is that the game will tell you what comic book they were introduced to. A great touch for many comic fans! If I had to point out some negatives to say, it would be that the boss fights felt really lackluster and underwhelming. This was disappointing because I was really looking forward to a good fight, especially having to chase them around the asylum for a good length of time. The detective mode felt both a blessing and totally unbalanced. Now I love this feature first hand. You can scan people to see if they are alive or unconscious, use it to solve puzzles, and even has a purpose for many story sections. The problem lies that  there is no penalty to using it. Seeing enemies through walls without any penalty felt really cheesy and a oversight in game design to a degree. Yes I know I can turn it off, but there are moments I forget too because you don't get like a cooldown or any penalty for it. Most of the time you have to rely on it as well, and that takes away from enjoying the game world a bit in my opinion. Also you don’t get any cool outfits to unlock. It’s not a serious thing, but it would have been cool to see some classic outfits.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story was pretty solid and it does a good job at keeping you interested and invested. The game has a more adult theme to it which I can appreciate a lot and fits the tone perfectly. The villains are introduced really well and respectively so! Going through the game you will even find audio logs, giving you more background about each villain and character. Some villains may have more screen time than others (which is to be expected), but I never found it to be a negative here because the pacing was really good. You will come across many encounters and sections but feel well designed and thought out. I never really had a dull moment with the story. It had some interesting twists as well.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]The story is roughly around 15-20+ hours of playtime. If you are looking to get 100% and complete all challenges then you are looking at 30+ hours, maybe even more! The replayability is very minor due to the game's linear level design, but overall has a good amount of time for you to put in and have fun.[/td]

        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The voice acting is top tier. All of the voice actors did a perfect job and absolutely enjoyed every dialogue from the game. The prisoners even had amazing dialogue!  A big praise to both Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamil as the Joker! Total class acts and memorable performances from the two. Besides the voice acting, the music was also really fitting and I enjoyed every bit of it. Batman punching enemies in the face and hearing those massive blows always sounded so satisfying. The sound design is just incredible, and I can't find any fault in it. A fantastic job from the developers![/td]

        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Batman: Arkham Asylum is an absolute blast in both gameplay, and storytelling. It’s not a perfect game, but if you are a fan of the Batman universe and villains then grab this game. I’m not a hardcore Batman fanatic, but I even had an absolute blast with this game. This game is the start of the famous Batman Arkhym games and I have to say, this game was a great first impression. I’m excited to try the other games out! Give this game a shot, you will most likely have an amazing experience just like I did.[/td]

-Good story
-Fun mix of fighting and detective work
-Liked how you could use a lot of different gear (batclaw, batarang, etc) realistically
-Nice visuals/graphics even though it's a bit older
-Great voice acting
-Get your money worth in time played

[h3]Meh -[/h3]

-Controls a bit janky/hard to maneuver sometimes
-Sometimes a bit hard to see where things are/where you should go (although eventually 
 always figured it out)
-Ending felt a bit too quick

-Going for achievements can be a pain; finding the riddler's countless trophies, many of which

-Not too much replayability.

[h3]Overall -[/h3]

You don't need to be a comic book or superhero fan to like this game (I'm not either of those).  It just has a great story, and it's fun to play through it.  The story itself is also not too long or short; it's just the right amount of time.  Of course, plenty of action too.  That's really it!  If you like a mix of good storytelling, physical fighting, and detective work, you will probably love playing this.",1674843187,1706889164,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the first game of the franchise, I decided to revisit the franchise since I loved the games so much growing up, the problem is the mark the new Suicide Squad game left, It is developed by rocksteady, It takes place in the Arkham universe. Our lovely hero, however, does not make it out alive, instead he's given a shitty death on a bench with a bullet put between his eyes. I can't take these games seriously anymore, they just don't feel right to play anymore, the greatest superhero game franchise turned into a joke for me. 
Well, no negativity towards these games, they were truly ahead of their time, but whoever wrote the script for SSKJL should be sent to Arkham asylum, Decapitated after years of studying their brains and torture and finally sending flash back in time to fix this bullshit.
In the end, good game, 10/10,2nd greatest superhero game of all time (next to arkham city)

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1672429435,1706623340,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game does a lot of work to translate over the notion of *feeling* like Batman onto the gameplay, both in terms of stealthily navigating around enemies and the brutality of hand-to-hand combat, with building combos constantly fulfilling - enough so I have intentionally wandered around and taking longer than I should have to move through spaces/levels just to pick more fights for the dopamine.

The game goes on sale for sub five dollars, and while I hate seeing Warner Brothers get more money it's hard to argue that this isn't an amazing steal for that price, and even the full pricetag of $20 feels pretty solid for the length of the game's main campaign and other challenge modes aside for addicts to the combat system like myself, who fell in love with it via Shadow of Mordor.",1705736717,1705736717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Where countering is seemless and simple. Unfortunately, it's too simple and not exactly the most challenging game I've played. But at least it was fun!

However, this is a console port. Worst of all, a Square Enix game on PC. So as expected, it doesn't run that well in low-mid tier hardware. The recommended specs are WAY too low for this game. There NO WAY any PC from 2010 could've handled this game at maximum settings (1080p), not in this port. I couldn't even handle it at 1080p with NO settings on! 

Once I entered the room with Dr. Young, I instantly dropped down to 18fps, despite having mostly 60fps (Maximum settings, 720p) the entire time I was playing before. I'm glad I was able to refund at 2h59m!

Overall, this game is just yet another shetty console port on PC. Which was expected, given my experiences with console ports on PC and with Square Enix titles (FF14 was the only one that ran properly)

The Story is pretty fun and does a good job at pushing the game forward. The characters are all really entertaining and bring a lot of depth to the game. Also i have to say that the voice actors that they got for these games are just the perfect match like Kevin Conroy (RIP) has such a distinct voice and is (to me at least) the definitive voice of batman and the same has to be said about Mark Hamill as the joker. 

The Setting of Arkham asylum is really well designed with there being tons of areas that offer different tones and atmospheres that all come together to make this place feel lived in and also to show how bad of a place it is. 

Visually, its impressive how well this game holds up. Performance was a bit iffy while a good portion of the game felt smooth, there were many times where there would be stutter and kinda threw me off it a bit, however there were no bugs or glitches throughout my playtime. The art direction is really well done with it being realistic but also having this grimy look to all of it. I also have to appreciate the little details here and there such as batmans' suit deteriorating throughout the game due to events or even just the minor map details when you reach certain points of the game. 

Sound and Audio are pretty good with the soundtrack being the perfect fit of making the game feel dark but also epic. The Audio is pretty decent with a good portion of the actions such as the explosive gel and batarangs but some of the sounds when an enemy hits you or you hitting an enemy can sound and little goofy. 

In terms of gameplay, its basic but still fun. Movement feels great and suits batman very well. The combat of this game has been so influential for the right reasons but, due to what the future games do with it, its pretty average but still enjoyable. All the gadgets in this game are nice to use however you'll mainly be using the majority of these to either progress through a certain part of the game or to get riddler trophies. The riddler trophies are well spread out and feel like there's the right amount of them to collect. I like the scarecrow sections when it comes to the presentation but the gameplay itself like dodging his gaze is a bit meh and the boss fights are fine with one of them just being a copy of an enemy you will run into a lot in this game. Now there are challenge modes for this game but honestly, there isn't much reason as to go back and play this game as the 2 titles that come after it have so much more to offer and make this game feel like a one time playthrough. 

Overall, Batman Arkham Asylum is a decent experience that had a lot of influence on many game to come after it. However, even though this game is good, the sequels just go above and beyond what this game had to offer.",1690885365,1705374185,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 As of writing this I've completed about 30%. So far it's not that deep. It's been mostly just running around beating up henchmen, and stealth missions, with a boss every now and then.

Overall good but not great.

Batman: Arkham Asylum remains just as fun to play as it did way back in 2009 and then some. Is this game's mechanics clunky and unrefined compared to the leaps and strides City and Knight innovated on? Certainly. Are the graphics and the 720P cutscenes dated by today's standards? Sure. Is Arkham City still the undisputed GOAT of the franchise? Undoubtedly. However, what City and Knight make up for in mechanics and gameplay, this game nails in atmosphere and tone. In no other instance in the franchise is such a setting as creepy, disquieting and uncomfortable as Arkham Asylum. The dark and decrepit hallways that may just have a lunatic lurking around the corner or above you in the vents really does instill a sense of dread and foreboding as you navigate through the many rooms and buildings of the asylum. Per usual, Kevin Conroy plays an excellent Batman but I'd argue Mark Hamill steals the show with a delightfully unhinged performance as Joker, with an excellent turn from the late Arleen Sorkin reprising her role as Harley Quinn. For many fans, I think returning to Asylum after playing the later games of the franchise may be difficult given the numerous combat enhancements, gadgets and overall QOL improvements that were made, however there is a reason this game is such a masterpiece and put superhero games on the map for the modern era.

although it has some postivies and negatives but overall this game is just amazing.

i guesss the combat could have been much more better and for bosses. bosses are kinda spammer they just run you have to hit them with batrang then beat them and this same technique is applicable to most of bosses.

the big punch where batman knock out goon is pretty slow and kinda irritating at times cause if any goon is gonna hit Batman he cannot dodge it in that animation. 

stealth mode in this game was just amazing. sometimes these stealth missions were more tough than beating goons and bosses cause almost every guy has a gun and a little sound and you are dead

joker,s madness in this game was just next level the voice really hits. 

irritating part of the game i guesss nightmare one rather than that. remote batrang controls were a little bit tough atleast for me. 

i expected final fight to be a total chaos between Batman and Joker but it was just a trick fight where you need to fight goons pull joker and make him fall down and then beat him. final fight had to be a total menace. i was kinda disappointed in that. 

for conclusion: this game has some flaws but overall the gaming experience is just amazing. the surroundings,missions everything was just great totally recommended.

I will say I preferred this one's lack of an open world, despite what some think, open world doesn't necessarily make a game better. Arkham Asylum just had my attention more all around.

For those of you who haven't played any of these Arkham games, this is the first. This game consists of combat, stealth, and the need for some patience. By patience, I mean sometimes the game wants precision and you will sometimes feel like the game was not built for it. Nothing game breaking and typically small, but I find it annoying when, say, you jump for a ledge and Batman just doesn't grab.

The story takes the setting to a new level, the riddler challenges gives extra to make the game fun, the graphics hold up a couple of decades later, and the gameplay is so unpredictable and charming that gives a lot of inspiration to the superhero. Not only would I call this a must play, especially for Batman fans like me, but also even recommend making it to full completion to look for easter eggs from all the riddles. This could even have you get to know more about Batman because those make the game welcome to the players that have not known a lot about the characters and what the series is.

While elements like combat, stealth and traversal are VERY basic when compared to future entries, it provides a very solid foundation that, even if simple, is still incredibly fun today.

The atmosphere is easily one of the biggest highlights. The asylum itself is just as much a character as Batman and his foes. It's creepy, unnerving and tells a story purely by it's appearance. I cannot praise Rocksteady enough, they did a fantastic job.

The voice acting is also a major highlight. From Kevin Conroy (R.I.P) to Arleen Sorkin (R.I.P.) and Mark Hamill, everyone did a phenomenal job.

However, I'm confident in writing a recommendation for this all-time classic regardless. Admittedly, its graphics have started to show its age, texture-wise, and the community has had to come up with custom configuration settings in the files just to make Arkham Asylum consistently functional, performance-wise, even on higher-end specs. Additionally, Arkham Asylum is no longer the groundbreaking superhero game it was back in 2009 --- it proved the genre's potential beyond cheap marketing for movies --- and since then, talented studios, such as Insomniac, have gone on to bring classic comic heroes to life. Truly, it has become a product of its time, but the amazing free-flow combat system, spectacularly voiced performances from Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, etc, and the overall immersive qualities, both in a mechanical and diagetic sense, ensure you'll have just as much fun as I did nearly 15 years ago.

With that said, I cannot recommend a poorly configured piece of software in good conscience without providing some helpful fixes:

Step 1: Install the Advanced Launcher located on Nexus Mods. You'll need it to turn off and/or configure certain performance-intensive features, such as anti-aliasing. A setting that smoothes the edges of 3D objects. I know, I know. The recommended specs above may fool you, but remember, Arkham Asylum was primarily made with the PS3 and Xbox 360 in mind. This PC port leaves much to be desired. That aside, you'll also need the program 7-Zip to extract the files. Once extracted, make sure you specifically move the launcher file into the Binaries folder in Arkham Asylum's local files, accessible from your Steam library, or your desktop's Folder application. Otherwise, the vanilla launcher won't be properly overwritten. Here's a link for that: https://www.nexusmods.com/batmanarkhamasylum/mods/117

Step 2 (for NVIDIA users): Right-click on your desktop background and select ""NVIDIA Control Panel"". Once there, select ""Configure Surround, PhysX"", and set your processor to your PC's graphics processing unit. Mine, for example, is a 1060ti. Not its core processing unit, nor the ""Auto-Select (recommended)"" setting. 

Step 3 (for NVIDA users): Make sure your drivers are updated to the latest software version. If they're not, use this link here: https://www.nvidia.com/content/DriverDownloads/confirmation.php?url=/Windows/9.19.0218/PhysX-9.19.0218-SystemSoftware.exe&lang=us&type=GeForce

Step 4: Use these configuration files for improved performance. Though, I recommend ignoring the ""max settings"" requirement for lower-end PC users. Follow the rest of the instructions to the letter:

The goon sighed. ""The plot's kinda dumb. But it's a Batman game. Th' fuck ya want, lady? Look, the characters are all on point, the voice acting's great, the redesigns of all the classic Batman stuff is grimy and trashy but it works. They even got Mark Hamill back!""

""Who?""

""The [i]original voice of the Joker[/i]. From the Animated Series? The one everyone holds up like a fuckin' religion? Jesus, lady, ya dense?""

The interrogator leaned back in her seat. A frown.

""...Sorry.""

""Continue.""

""The music's great, the gameplay's fine. I mean it's a bit clunky, but it was /innovating/ somethin'. Ya don't start somethin' new and knock it out of the park on the first swing.""

""What about the boss fights?""

A very long, very uncomfortable pause. The goon stares down at the table.

""The boss fights,"" she repeated. ""What about the boss fights?""

""...I mean, Poison Ivy is there, and-""

Her hands slammed on the table. The goon recoiled in terror.

""OKAY! OKAY! FINE! THE BOSS FIGHTS! THEY'RE TERRIBLE, THEY'RE NOT FUN AT ALL, THEY'RE BORING AND SAMEY AND UNINTERESTING! Fuck! Fine! You got me, okay?! But that's the ONLY BAD THING. Come ON, lady, nothing's perfect! Fine! Fuck! Can I go already?!""

""No,"" the interviewer said, with a gaze that could bore holes through his skull. ""We're not done, yet.""

Developed by Rocksteady Studios, this game is a dark and gripping journey into the heart of madness that not only captures the essence of the Batman universe but also sets a new standard for action-adventure games.

From the outset, Arkham Asylum impresses with its atmospheric presentation. The asylum itself becomes a character in its own right, a nightmarish labyrinth of crumbling architecture, flickering lights, and haunting echoes. The attention to detail in the design of both the environments and the characters is nothing short of phenomenal, creating a visually stunning and immersive experience.

The narrative of Arkham Asylum is a compelling blend of psychological thriller and superhero drama. As Batman, players find themselves trapped on Arkham Island with some of Gotham's most notorious criminals, including the Joker, who orchestrates a chaotic takeover of the asylum. The story unfolds with a perfect balance of suspense and action, keeping players on the edge of their seats while delving into the complexities of the Dark Knight's psyche.

The voice acting, particularly the performances of Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker, adds an extra layer of authenticity to the characters. The chemistry between these two iconic characters is palpable and contributes significantly to the overall narrative impact.

The gameplay mechanics of Arkham Asylum are revolutionary, introducing the Freeflow combat system that allows players to seamlessly transition between attacks, counters, and evasions. The fluidity of combat makes players feel like the caped crusader, effortlessly taking down groups of enemies with a combination of martial arts and gadgetry. The Detective Mode, another innovative feature, enhances Batman's detective skills, adding a strategic element to exploration and crime-solving.

The game's clever level design and puzzle-solving elements make Arkham Asylum more than just a beat-em-up. Navigating the asylum requires a combination of stealth, intellect, and combat prowess. The predator sections, where Batman takes on armed enemies from the shadows, are particularly exhilarating and showcase the character's mastery of fear.

Arkham Asylum is not just a solitary experience; it's a celebration of Batman's rogues' gallery. The encounters with iconic villains like Scarecrow, Killer Croc, and Poison Ivy are memorable and serve as a testament to the game's commitment to honoring the source material.

In terms of audio, the soundtrack composed by Ron Fish and Nick Arundel perfectly complements the dark and brooding atmosphere of Arkham Asylum. The music intensifies during critical moments, enhancing the overall emotional impact of the narrative.

In conclusion, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a masterclass in superhero gaming. Its innovative gameplay, gripping narrative, and faithful representation of the Batman universe make it a timeless classic. Whether you're a fan of the Dark Knight or simply enjoy immersive action-adventure experiences, Arkham Asylum is a must-play that continues to influence and inspire superhero games to this day.",1657605563,1704085864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing this game had not crossed my mind until I looked at all the Game of the Year (GOTY) awards from previous years, from many websites and gaming companies. Having played, I now understand. Here's why:

Pros:
-Very good immersion. You act as Batman from the very start.
-Simple but deep action combat system.
-Excellent variety and pacing: A bit of combat, I do a challenge, then back to story mode, searching for clues.
-Multiple modes of gameplay. Flying Batman, grappling Batman, investigating, fighting, talking, etc.
-The graphics are very nice. The atmosphere is dark but everything is detailed and looks awesome.
-There are hidden secrets, challenges, backstories about all the lore, a hidden batcave, gadgets, upgrades...
-Overall, everything fits well. The visuals, the upgrades, the story, the combat, etc.

Cons:
-There's no manual save. Only automatic Checkpoints and sometimes, they might save your game right after a poor performance in combat. As such, you can't load and must continue the story with that poor performance. It's not a big thing but it did annoy me at least once.

⚠️ Played through with the Asylum Reborn - HD Texture Pack Mod version 1.1 released in November, 2022.

So this is where it all began, back in 2009? 

I came into this game expecting some of that “old game jank”. I expected to struggle with the controls. And keep in mind, I played all the other games in the franchise before this first one. So I was also worried that nothing would feel fresh. That the developers had recycled so many of the ideas between the games, that I wouldn’t be able to enjoy it to its fullest. That I had, in essence, already “ruined the experience” by playing it last. 

Well, it turns out my worries were unfounded. Because this game laid the groundwork for the Arkham games that came after. This is the foundation upon which they were built. Asylum felt fresh and interesting throughout the experience.

And not only that. It’s the perfect combination of all my favorite elements of the later games in the series. The atmosphere, boss fights, story… everything comes together so nicely. 

But not only does this game do the things I enjoyed just a little better - it also doesn’t do the things I disliked about the later games. 

Heck, even getting Riddler Trophies was enjoyable in Asylum, and I had zero interest in getting them in the later games. 

The level design is much clearer in this one and I was able to navigate the levels much easier, without getting lost or feel unsure of where to go or what to do. 

The combat, while not as elaborate as the later entries in the series, felt more focused. There are less specific enemy strategies to worry about which means you don’t have to deal with as many required button-presses. For example, there are no enemies with shields, and the annoying “knife dodge” isn’t in the game. I personally think the lack of those two enemy types makes the game better as they frequently disrupted the flow of combat and only served to reduce player creativity during large fights.

The boss fights all felt fresh and engaging, but I do think Arkham Origins did those just a little better. 

The story, however, ended up being my favorite out of the Arkham games.

So, there you have it. Calling this game anything but a masterpiece would just be dishonest.

This game encapsulates a gritty graphic novel brought to life more than most other superhero games, and while the later Arkham games add on to the gameplay, none of them compare to the haunting gothic aesthetic of Asylum. From the sound design to the music and the beautiful UI elements, this is a true comic book game.
There are some issues to be had, some are issues of the time, and others are not worth the excuse. The combo system can be unforgiving, ending with a single mistake or even a little patience, the game won't always know who you are targeting or what action you were supposed to do if you are a bit too far from your target. The story can be odd, dialogue seems single draft, but one cannot deny the talent put forth in the performances. There's also a glaring issue in the penultimate cutscene that has still remained unfixed.
Those issues aside, the game is still perfectly enjoyable, I honestly have more issues with the sequels than this one. I make sure to play it 100% every year. If you enjoy DC, Batman, Superheroes, or goth games, this is a necessity to play. 10/10",1703661883,1703661883,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game will make you feel like you've had a crash course in caped crusading. In just 12 hours of game play, you'll traverse a madhouse, battle baddies, and confront your deepest fears—without the benefit of an Alfred to patch you up after.

The game play? As addictive as Gotham's crime rate. The story? Good enough to make Scarecrow's gasp-inducing antics nearly as memorable as Batman's tragic backstory. His obsession with rehashing the whole 'Bruce Wayne's parents' ordeal might just make you want to sign up for a therapy session yourself.

And speaking of wear and tear, forget the Batsuit; your controller might need a replacement after the intense workout it gets from button mashing and stealthy takedowns. But hey, isn't that what being the Dark Knight is all about? The exhaustion, the adrenaline, the emotional baggage—all in a day's work for Batman. Or in this case, a player determined to finish this gripping game.

So, if you're ready to immerse yourself in the shoes (or should I say, the boots) of the caped crusader, Batman Arkham Asylum is your bat signal. Just remember, when the game's over, you might feel like you've taken on the Joker and emerged victorious—exhilarated, slightly battered, but ultimately, feeling like a hero.""",1703507983,1703507983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Straight to the point, this game doesn’t have the hundred secondary missions that Origins had, and that makes sense, not much to do on an island full of prisoners, Enigma’s things are OK, I’m not a completionist gamer so it doesn’t matter, but I did miss the cinematics or conclusion on Enigma, nothing this time. But there are some other secrets, I watched them on YT, I prefer that rather than wasting my time for some little thing. Appreciate development of the characters, Scarecrow is a nice villain, Harley is annoying, so she’s on character. This game lacked Batman x Joker story and relation development in comparison to the Origins, but that could make sense.

This games combat and story is fantastic. The graphics at the time was top tier and still holds up today imo. I love running around as the dark knight unlocking new gadgets and skills. You can rush in head first and beat the crap out of a group of criminals and you can also sneak around and take them out one by one. I very much enjoyed this game and recommend it. There are many unique ways you can play with the gadgets as well.

2. The Bad: The enemies you face can be a little repetitive sometimes and some of the bosses as well but that doesn't really make it any less fun to beat em up.

I just personally like getting things on sale. It's a classic batman story with fantastic atmosphere and top notch voice acting.

Arkham Asylum is masterful, its a cliché but the game really does make you feel like you're the Dark Knight, it accentuates the physicality, the brutality, the danger of Batman's work, while demonstrating that he may just be able to overcome whatever challenges face him.

The free flow combat is a standout, it's effortless to wrack up combos against countless things, while the game later introduces varied enemies that make things much more interesting.

The stealth sections are more about hunting the enemies, rather than hiding, you can see around corners, straight through them, and and dart around undetected as your foes freak the f**k out.

The asylum stands alongside Black Mesa, the Von Braun, Rapture and all the other quintessential locations in games, it's spooky and atmospheric, great fun to explore with wonderful pacing, you're never doing the same thing for too long.

I won't spoil the mind-blowing boss encounters, there's some dull ones but the highlights are truly special and further elevate the game, I really can't recommend it enough.

If you haven't played Asylum before, you need to get on it, it's genuinely one of the great games of all time, I can't recommend it enough, and also great on the Steam Deck if you've got one.",1702233872,1702233872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

replaying this game was a trip down memory lane.

The greatest positives I have are the accuracy to the comics and gameplay. There are so many Easter Eggs for long time Batman fans and the characterisation for the protagonist, antagonists and everything in between is strong enough for anybody new to Batman to get into the characters and world or appreciate how the writers captured them for people who have known these characters for long enough.
The combat flows really well. From hitting, stunning, countering and using gadgets you will always have enough options as the player to combat the enemies and never once feel like you are taken out of the experience.
The overworld is not too big and has enough density to keep you looking out for secrets and enemies. The gadgets all feed into the gameplay within the overworld that you always feel challenged but not overwhelmed with choice for which gadget works where.

My criticisms with Arkham Asylum are the constant reuse of one particular type of boss fight and one section type(?) Both are reused a good amount but the main story makes sense for at least the former to be prevalent.
I can also nitpick that you can easily tell when the cinematics play compared to gameplay, aswell as some of the audio quality can be a bit compressed.

Otherwise this is an easy recommendation.",1675120317,1702064836,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good:
-If you're a Batman fan, there's a tone of lore for you. 

-There's plenty of collectibles. and there's a fair bit of challenge to getting them.

-I don't think I had any bugs, which is rare these days.

-The game looks great, although graphics aren't important.



The OK:
The combat. The free flow is fun, and requires you to pay attention. It can be fun to jump back and forth across the screen, hitting sending enemies flying. The problem is when it doesn't work. A  lot of times you aim at someone, hit the button to jump across the screen, and you just punch at air. When you get swarmed, the game can send you at the enemy you didn't want to with the wrong attack. For as fun as it is, it's flaws are equally as noticeable.

-The movement. It's blocky, and clunky. At the time this game was made, most games had more fluid movement figured out years earlier.

-The story. It's ok. It's Batman and the Joker.





The bad:
-To be honest....I got nothing. No real complaints. Damn...

Overall, if you're a big fan of Batman or the Free Flow combat, you'll love it. I'm a casual of both of those, so take my review for that. It's still a fun game, and I recommend it.

Rocksteady has crafted an immersive and exhilarating experience that not only pays homage to the iconic caped crusader but sets an incredibly high standard for action-adventure games as a whole.

The game's narrative is a roller coaster of suspense and intrigue, written with the same finesse as a classic Batman comic. From the outset, players find themselves trapped on Arkham Island with the Joker, unleashing chaos in a sinister plot that keeps you guessing until the very end. The voice acting, led by the legendary Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker, is stellar and adds a cinematic quality to the storytelling.

Where Batman: Arkham Asylum truly shines is in its gameplay mechanics. The free-flow combat system is a work of art, allowing players to seamlessly switch between attacking, countering, and using gadgets in a rhythmic dance of destruction. It's easy to feel the power and agility of the Dark Knight as you take on waves of enemies with a sense of finesse rarely seen in other action games.

The stealth elements are equally praiseworthy. Sneaking through the shadows, using gadgets to outsmart armed thugs, and striking fear into the hearts of enemies captures the essence of Batman's detective skills. The level design complements these mechanics, providing a diverse range of environments within Arkham Asylum, each filled with secrets and challenges that encourage exploration.

The attention to detail in the game world is outstanding. From the iconic Bat-Signal to the gritty interiors of Arkham, every aspect of the environment is meticulously crafted. The atmospheric soundtrack adds an extra layer of tension and excitement, immersing players in the dark and foreboding atmosphere of Batman's world.

Arkham Asylum's inclusion of the detective mode adds a unique twist to the gameplay. While it aids in tracking enemies and solving puzzles, it also reinforces the idea that Batman is not just a brawler but a brilliant detective, showcasing his intellect and resourcefulness.

In conclusion, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a stellar achievement in the world of video games. Its engaging narrative, fluid game play, and attention to detail make it a must-play for both Batman fans and gaming enthusiasts alike. Rocksteady Studios has not only delivered the definitive Batman experience but has set a benchmark for superhero games that is yet to be surpassed. If you haven't donned the cape and cowl in Arkham Asylum, you're missing out on one of the greatest superhero gaming experiences of all time.",1701273785,1701273785,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The whole greener feel of the map is honestly a big plus to me, the boss battles were actually incredibly fun, only being, [spoiler] the last boss battle felt kind of underwhelming [/spoiler] but other than that, I've played this game twice, actually, and enjoyed both playthroughs thoroughly, regardless of everything.

The interface of this game is uniquely different and fits the vibe well, they kind of just dropped that ever since.

Lets start with the good:
The game really makes you feel like batman. The combat is really smooth and satisfying and gives you a good adrenaline hit when you get a high combo. Even though the island is small, every building in there is like a section of the story and i think that's cool. The story itself is awesome and it experiments with things that a lot of games today don't do anymore. The riddler challenges actually reward you with things like character trophys alongside other things and some of the ""riddles"" are actually quite interesting. The upgrades always add something new and they make most of the backtracking less jarring. And all of the gadgets are cool af.
Now for the bad:
 The biggest criticism that a lot of people (including me) have is the bossfights: bane is a good introduction but it should've had more different moves/AI than the titanhenchmen and rest of the fights are titanhenchmen or gimmick fights. Sometimes the counter doesn't really work or the timing is different but maybe that's a skill issue. The backtracking probably isn't something that most people get annoyed with and tbh it's not that bad, but it's still there and there's enough of it to criticize it. (it didn't stop me from 100%:ing the game though)

Overall there is more content than there is reusing it, more new riddles than old ones, the story's awesome (especially the scarecrow parts), the game isn't too long and even 100 percenting the game isn't that boring (I'd have to play the game again though 'cause I missed one achievement, if you've played the game you prob. know which one.)

man ham aselum is a great game. Highly recommend

Undoubtedly, it's a great game, and if you're a Batman enthusiast who somehow hasn't experienced it yet, it comes highly recommended. Often available at a reasonable price during sales, it offers a thoroughly enjoyable journey into the dark and atmospheric setting of Arkham.

Being the inaugural installment, Arkham Asylum does exhibit some signs of its early development. While the story is undeniably great, the ending might leave some wanting more, and the overall narrative could be seen as relatively short, lacking the depth of side quests that later entries in the series would introduce. Aside from the Riddler trophies, there's a notable absence of side quests, contributing to a more linear gameplay experience. The combat system, which revolutionized the superhero genre, is not without its quirks. Though the combat mechanics laid the groundwork for future titles, they can feel somewhat unpolished at times, especially in challenge maps where maintaining a combo can be frustrating due to occasional hiccups.

Despite these nuances, Arkham Asylum is a must-play for Batman fans. It may have its rough edges, but the game shines in its atmospheric brilliance. The hauntingly beautiful yet terrifying setting of Arkham Asylum, combined with a richly fleshed-out cast of characters, immerses players in the Batman experience like never before. You're not just playing as Batman; you are Batman, navigating the psychological depths of Arkham, empathizing with its inmates, and questioning the impact of the environment on their mental well-being. Flaws aside, Arkham Asylum delivers a unique and unforgettable experience that any Batman fan should embrace without hesitation.

Obviously, this was first in line and did not disappoint in the slightest. The concept was so cool, typically you see inmates breaking out of Arkham so being trapped on the island with the villains for a change was super cool. The music was dope, the atmosphere was tense and it was an awesome experience to play. The gameplay was fairly simple, not too hard or complicated (though I really need to learn to counter better). I will say, playing on Normal mode, the bosses started out really good but I think they got continuously repetitive which kinda became a drag, especially later on with some particular bosses. I'm just starting my second playthrough on hard so if that changes with the mode I'll write that here, but overall the bosses were pretty tough which was nice. However*********SPOILER*********the final boss is very underwhelming compared to bosses played previously. It was almost pathetically easy how quickly the final battle came and went compared to how many times I died trying to beat other bosses********END SPOILER*********

Verse 1:
Boy, tell me, can you take the Joker away? 🃏
Creeping through the Arkham Asylum's decay 🌑
Got you grappling from ledge to ledge, no time for breaks 🦇
'Cause I'm feeling so brave 🌟

[INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM IN ARKHAM ASYLUM]

JOKER: (leaning against a wall, grinning) Ah, Batman, my brooding buddy, and Harley, my favorite gal-pal! Let's chat about that Arkham Asylum game, shall we? Oh, what a hoot it was! But I've got to say, Batsy, they should've renamed it ""Darkham Asylum."" I mean, come on, you practically run the place, and they might as well call it the ""Batman Museum of Punchable Rogues.""

[BATMAN and HARLEY sit at a table, both chuckling.]

BATMAN: (stoic) Well, Joker, I have to admit, ""Arkham Asylum"" was quite an experience. It captured the essence of the asylum and the challenges I face perfectly.

HARLEY: (grinning) Puddin', I gotta agree with the clown on this one. The game was a real blast. The story was so engaging, and it made us all look... dare I say it... cool!

JOKER: (grinning widely) You see, old chum, I had a blast making those insane riddles for you. It's like a demented version of ""Wheel of Fortune,"" but with more fear gas and fewer vowels. And speaking of fear gas, Harley, you really ought to share some of that pie with the rest of us. It's not like we're trying to take over the world or anything... oh, wait, we are!

[BATMAN raises an eyebrow, and HARLEY giggles.]

BATMAN: (calmly) The game captured the atmosphere of Arkham perfectly. The dark and foreboding tone, the intricate level design, and the clever puzzles all added to the experience.

HARLEY: (nodding) Yeah, and the characters, Puddin'! They were spot on. I mean, who could forget that creepy Scarecrow? Even you looked pretty intimidating, Mr. J.

JOKER: (feigning modesty) Well, you know, it's hard to capture all this fabulousness on screen, but they did an okay job.

BATMAN: (smirking) And your hideouts, Joker, they were quite the challenge to infiltrate. The game kept me on my toes.

HARLEY: (grinning) And the combat, Batsy! It was like a dance of destruction. You looked so graceful taking down those thugs.

JOKER: (raising an eyebrow) All right, all right, I'll admit it was fun watching you two praise the game. But let's not forget that it's all about me, the Clown Prince of Crime, right?

BATMAN: (smirking) Well, Joker, in ""Arkham Asylum,"" you definitely stole the show, just like you always try to.

HARLEY: (giggling) That's right, Puddin'! So here's to ""Arkham Asylum"" – a game that let us relive our greatest hits and reminded us all that we're the stars of this crazy circus.

JOKER: (grinning) Cheers to the game that proves I'm the real star of the show, and you two are just my supporting cast. Ta-ta for now, Batsy and Harley!

The moment you will start the game the visuals will make you feel like this is not a game that was released over a decade ago with no bugs whatsoever.

The gameplay is not like MKX or Injustice where you have to learn the combos but instead you fight with the option to evade,counter and stun which is a lot easy than learning which buttons to mash to get the fight going on brutally.

The length of the game is around 21 hours(on normal whch does not feel like a challenge) if you also collect the riddles left by the riddler side by side.I did just that and my total game progress is 82% and I have collected more than 70% of the riddles.

Overall the game play is pretty straight forward and you will hardly find yourself stuck in a pickle.

Art direction is good for what it's trying to do, voice talent is top notch, setting is great. (hate the bobbing head camera though, makes me sick every time I have to run.) That being said, I don't actually like playing the game much. Gameplay aspects are all just kinda mid or wonky.

 Combat that's essentially mashing 2 buttons unless you have to batarang, then you press a THIRD button. Wooow.  

Final boss is literally just thugs that you've fought the whole game, but just a lot of them. That's like... every fight minus Poison Ivy, the one actual boss fight that's a boss fight. And it too, has you fight hordes of enemies in the middle of it. 

Stealth areas when they're good are fine, but not all are. Some rooms have people just off camera to almost make you fail once before trying again. Others are set up well so you can do it the first try if you're careful, but it's a mixed bag. 

 It's fine, but if you want a superhero game, newer stuff is better. Spiderman PS4 IS a better game to me. This has been in bundles, gone on sale for $5 a dozen times, etc, so it's worth it if you can't afford something else or REALLY love Batman, but even then... idk. It's fine. Hopefully the sequels smoothed out some edges, maybe I'll enjoy them more.

My perception of Batman is built entirely on the gritty, grounded realism of The Dark Knight films. These films captured my imagination as they didn’t require a considerable suspension of disbelief to immerse yourself; Bruce Wayne, and all his enemies, live inside vulnerable human bodies which are easily beaten and broken. They are supplemented often by high-tech gadgetry, but these are built from supposed military designs and follows, at least on the surface, known scientific concepts. For example: The Dark Knight shows Batman’s night-vision developed from sonar technology, indicating that his only real power is his wealth.

Such realism helps us view the human stories behind Batman and his enemies. Batman and Joker are reflections of each other: both faced historical traumas but instead chose two different paths in life, yet both operate above the law and with a dictatorial authority. There’s a sense that these characters could feasibly exist in our world, and perhaps show a reflection of two extremes that either of us could fall into. Whereas characters like Thor and Dr. Strange transcend reality and time at a whim, highlighting and boasting the fact that, at least biologically, they are nothing like us, the viewer.

That’s why it took a few hours for Arkham Asylum to really win me over. In this game, Batman’s spandex clings for dear life against the absolutely ripped body of Bruce Wayne, and the Joker morphs into several inhuman entities which stretch far beyond the realms of realism that attached me so closely to the cinematic series. One of the villains first introduced is a giant animated Crocodile, which immediately broke my immersion despite the game’s incredibly detailed graphics.

However, after taking a conscious effort to drop my traditional thoughts of what Batman is, I started to find enjoyment in Arkham Asylum’s world. Despite Batman’s voice actor lacking the gruff aggression and edginess of Christian Bale, Ben Affleck and Robert Pattison, Mark Hamill does give a genuinely funny and energetic performance as The Joker. The best voice acting comes from the audiotapes scattered across Arkham, which record psychological evaluations of Batman’s various villains as they’re posed questions of simple ethics and world views. 

Batman uses Metroidvania-esque exploration which encourages you to revisit areas to unlock additional paths once you obtain the corresponding skill. For example: half way through Arkham you obtain a hacking device to blow out control boxes, opening up previously locked doors, as well as a zipline to traverse long gaps. What makes exploration so compelling is the tangible feeling of progression, as you obtain new ability, combined with the comfort of backtracking to previous locations. Most areas won’t take longer than 5 minutes to travel to, and will reveal trophies and audiotapes to further reveal backstory, all of which are genuinely interesting, including stories of Arkham’s warden and the events which shaped his life.

The game’s stealth system, on paper, feels the most “Batman” of all encounters as you pick off enemies one by one from the shadows. These sections are fairly difficult as armed enemies clump together, particular when they notice their fallen comrade hanging from a stone gargoyle or unconscious near a control panel. Some elements feel underbaked: for example, the inability to drag bodies into the shadows feels like a clear omission which causes enemies to go onto high alert with little you can do about it. 

The games hand-to-hand system feels too rudimentary to be fun. Most fistfights consist of button mashing with very few combos to learn, a somewhat unreliable counter attack system, and no real opportunity to think creatively or adjust your approach. There were additional combat rooms to complete at the end of the game, which is the only piece of content I didn’t feel compelled to complete. 

Overall though, Batman: Arkham Asylum faithfully taps into a wealth of comic book source material to deliver a satisfying Metroidvania explore-a-thon served with a rather mundane combat system. If, like me, your perception of Batman is shaped by recent onscreen outings, try view this as an alternative take on the series and play through with an open mind. There’s plenty to explore, and it provides a great introduction to the wider Batman universe.",1699723027,1699724082,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I was never into super hero stuff as a kid, but Batman and Spider-Man were my favorite, as to most kids I would imagine. Anyway, I never played the Batman games until recently since the entire trilogy was like 8$ on a random sale. Wasn't expecting much until I saw the metacritic scores. Arkham Asylum has 92/100, Arkham City has 94/100 and Arkham Knight has 87/100. I mean these are some great scores I will tell you that much. So naturally my expectations were high, and suprisingly they were met. For a game that got released in early 2010, Arkham Asylum does so many things right and even better then many games today. Give the trilogy a shot, you won't be dissapointed, as I said I got all 3 games plus all the DLCs for 8$ on Steam, so its not like you are getting ripped off.",1698272648,1699697361,True,2,0,0.528596162796020508,0,True,False,False

I think fans of brawler type games will love this. For me though, I found the game play repetitive and tedious. It's really a subjective opinion rather than an objective one though. I didn't like the achievements. I found them annoying rather than challenging. I hated that I had to constantly go back to areas to find Riddler trophies and interview tapes.

Overall I think the vast majority of people are going to love this game, for me I found it to be middle of the road and it felt like I was always doing busy work with it.

I got hooked instantly and the combat gameplay is probably one of the best combat systems i have seen in a game. It was just very fun to punch the living crap out of the henchmen and bosses.

 I don't know if the AI is different in other difficulty settings but i played on hard (which is the most difficult one) and the AI for just simple thugs could sometimes kill the Batman, which often made for some good laughs. Nothing was as amusing as thinking you made an cool escape only to get sniped by a thug in the back. I might think that hard difficulty would not be so enjoyable for some players, but i personally really liked it. But i still suggest trying on medium on your first time.

 I never really delved into the Batman universe that much before but after playing this game i re watched the Nolan Batman trilogy and bought the other games in the Arkham series when they were on sale. I really liked finding the extras stuff like Character BIOS and voice logs which really got me interested in the Batman lore. 
The setting, the characters, the story feels sometimes very raw which i really like and it doesn't treat you like a helpless kid. Its gritty, atmospheric, entertaining and most of all fun to play. 

The only complaint i would have is that the ending kinda came out of nowhere and could have been a bit longer. It could feel a bit more climactic. Other than that solid game i highly recommend!

It’s refreshing to play a Triple A mainstream game that sticks to the source material, where the main focus of the game is for the player to have an enjoyable experience, you don’t get that too much in modern Triple A slop. The characters and the dialog are very well written and voice acted. If you didn’t know anything about the Batman lore, you will after playing this game.

The gameplay revolves around stealth segments, beat em’ up segments, and collect-a-thon segments (Riddler Trophies) and works out well.

If you’re mostly a fan of modern day cape sh*t sloppa, and have a wall of Funko Pops behind you, then this game probably isn’t for you, but if you’re a fan of old school comic books, then it is a must play.

If you've ever wondered what happens when you mix the World's Greatest Detective with a madhouse full of the craziest villains Gotham has to offer, look no further than Batman: Arkham Asylum. Spoiler alert: it's a riot!

The Bat-tastic Adventure:
So, picture this: Batman, looking all broody and cape-y, decides to take the Joker for a leisurely stroll to Arkham Asylum. I mean, what could possibly go wrong, right? Well, everything. It's like the Joker planned a surprise party for Bats, and by ""surprise party,"" I mean he invited all his Arkham buddies to play a game of ""Let's See Who Can Give Batman the Biggest Headache.""

Bat-nanas Gadgets:
Let's talk gadgets. Batman's utility belt is basically the Swiss Army Knife of superhero accessories. Need to hack into a security system? Batarang! Need to take out a bunch of henchmen without breaking a sweat? Explosive Gel! It's like Batman went shopping at the ""Bad Guys Be Gone"" store, and everything was half off.

Arkham's Got Talent:
Now, let's talk about the inmates. Arkham Asylum is like the talent show from hell. You've got the Joker, who's basically a stand-up comedian with a really twisted sense of humor. Poison Ivy is there, making plants do her bidding. And let's not forget Killer Croc - a guy who takes ""going green"" to a whole new level. It's like the Justice League went on vacation, and Gotham's rogues' gallery decided to throw a party.

Detective Mode:
Oh, and Batman's Detective Mode? It's like his version of Insta-filter for crime scenes. He just puts on his super cool glasses, and suddenly, he can see footprints, analyze trajectories, and probably even tell you what the Riddler had for breakfast. It's almost unfair how good he is at crime-solving.

The Bat-voice:
Let's take a moment to appreciate Batman's gravelly voice. I mean, seriously, if I tried talking like that, I'd need a throat lozenge within five minutes. But Batman? He growls, and bad guys quiver in their mismatched socks. It's like having Clint Eastwood and a chainsaw in the same room.

Conclusion:
Batman: Arkham Asylum is like a wild night out in Gotham - full of crazy characters, mind-blowing gadgets, and enough bat-punching action to make you question why Batman doesn't have his own cooking show. If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and dive into the madness. It's Bat-tastic!",1698831575,1698831575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is loved by the Batman Arkham community, just like the other games. Some community members say that Asylum is the second-best game right behind City. When it was released, reviewers called it ''The Greatest Comic Book Game of All Time'' and ''The Best Superhero Game of Modern Times'', and two of the games in the franchise - Asylum and City won a GOTY award in 2010 and 2011 respectively.

Pros: 
- Spooky Atmosphere, especially once you reach a certain point in the game where new enemies appear.
- Good Boss Battles (Most Notably - Ivy)
- Voice Acting (Joker, Batman, Ivy)
- Riddles are easier to find than in the other games
The soundtrack is really good (The Asylum Intercom Chime is iconic in this game and eerie)
- The Map is really good
- The Scarecrow Battles
- Character Design (Batman, Joker, Croc, Scarecrow)
- Doesn't take up a lot of space.
- Good graphics for a game that doesn't need a good pc.

Cons:
- Enemy Designs are just a copy and paste with the Joker goons wearing the same thing almost every time.
- They could've done something better with Harley's ''boss battle''.
- Glitches like enemies can spot you through walls or explosive gel not exploding through a destroyable wall (Only happened a couple of times)
- The only mission outside of the main story is Riddler and only Riddler.

[spoiler] So it all starts with William afton, and his buddy named Henry. Afton was a dad, had a daughter named Elizabeth, a son named Micheal, and an unnamed (probably had name, was just never brought up) younger child, of whom is known as crying child, due to his constant crying in literally any situation. Now Afton and his buddy were geniuses that somehow created machinery centuries ahead of its time (fnaf starts in the 1980-2000’s), and start a new diner of which had two functional kiddie entertaining robots, those being fredbear (a bear), spring Bonnie (a bunny), and the security puppet (a marionette).Considering the amount of restaurants that existed, they were pretty successful. now another thing to mention, is that Afton (and only afton) is also a psychotic murder, and murdered what is possibly his first kiddie victim, although maybe not, some voice lines in UCN prove that chica (Susie) was the first victim. But this is the first victim shown in game at least, maybe he killed Susie but only did (stuff that is spoiling to the plot later on) after animatronics were able to be used, with that out of the way, mofo killed his buddy Henry’s daughter for some damn reason, his actions may or may not have purpose, but yet again, that’s later. There definitely was security puppet, but the kiddies inside the diner had seemed to use her (probably the puppet’s gender) aesthetic design against her, stacking boxes on the giant present she peeks out of to check the area, of which she was able to push off, yet a bit too late considering the kiddies locked out Henry daughter (I forgor her name srry lol), of which gave afton a perfect time to kill. The puppet then went outside in search of her, of which it was raining, and since the puppet was an early design, water screwed her up, of which she broke down while laying near (Henry’s daughter) corpse, of which seemed to somehow get her to possess the puppet. Now I could be screwing this all up, and it may have happened in the revamped location which is until later, but my brain isn’t functioning properly considering it’s 2:48 AM rn and I am doing this from memory. With that out, now we go to crying child’s pov. He was severely bullied by his older brother of who would terrorize him with a mask of the future face of foxy, for no (yet) explained reason. Another thing to mention is he had an attraction to Fred’s, yet was also terrified by it, and would at times try to sneak into Fred’s without his father’s permission. He had some weird ass plush of faz bear that would talk to him in full length sentences To prevent this, Afton had the genius idea to use genius tech ahead of even modern times, on his child, and make him have horrific hallucinations/nightmares of the future Freddy gang, and of fredbear, to deter him from trying to go back there, and that fazbearbplush? It seemed to be controlled with a microphone or something that William would talk to him or something like that. this didn’t seem to work, and for some odd reason, Afton thought it would be a cool idea to also have his birthday party there. Micheal was also there, and with some of his own buddies, and they all had the great idea of grabbing crying child and put him inside of fredbear’s jaw so that he could “kiss him”, of which caused his frontal lobe to get bitten off, or something like that, and no, this is NOT the bite of 87, since it happened in the year 83(television showing the show “fred bear and friends” proves this). now, it is uncertain if crying child died or survived, and for a period of time it was considered that he was the protagonist we play as, of which is now false, but it seems to point towards him dying, and semi possessing golden Freddy. Now, another thing to mention is that his sister may or may not have died before him, but I am currently not functioning, and have no clue which goes first. After loosing a child, he promptly closed down the diner, but then also had the genius idea of opening a few more restaurants. Now this is where I am uncertain about things, there seemed to be another location, but some stuff are screwing up my brain, yeah, srry. During or if not very closely after opening Fred’s diner, he opened another chain of restaurants, with the iconic Freddy gang that includes Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. Now he also murdered kiddies I’m this pizzeria, and instead of leaving the bodies back in an alley way, he had the luxury of putting corpses of children that decay, inside of entertainment robots, of which the puppet somehow caused them all to get possessed, and start acting aggressive to security guards, as they resemble their murder. It was closed down after the odor of decaying corpses became visible to the human nose. Then he decided to make yet another chain, and from the looks of it, it wasn’t he who did it, but his good ol pal Henry, with even crazier tech, revamping old designs, and causing an entire fan base horny for a chicken who resembles a human more than it’s respective animal, hence forth causing people to be semi furrys, yet not at the same time-ish? And the old animatronics were just tossed in the parts in service for no reason at all. now, Afton wasn’t just gonna let Henry play him that easily, and then created yet more crazy tech, with animatronics that can blow ballons with their fingers, and fucking ice cream aswell, the Funtime animatronics, of which he also specifically designed to kill kiddies and stuff their bodies inside themselves without his action. Specifically programmed to get kiddies who are by themselves, far from the crowd. Afton also prevented his daughter from coming in contact from the child’s dream, so she inevitably sneaked to the specific robot known as baby, of which she had to do so by being far from human contact, and got killed by baby, and none of the kids knew because they was in another room shouting and stuff. So the dumbass lost two kids to his own creations. He coped through it though, moved the Funtime animatronics down to his (what is speculated, and also probable) giant ass basement under his house,made them into rentals from then on, and decided his next best action was to go to a newer, yet seemingly lower quality tech pizzeria, of which I am currently confused of considering I’m doing this from my own damn memory, to break down the og fnaf gang with his own damn bare hands, and this is where I may have screwed up, the scrapped gang of Freddy in fnaf 2, but what I do know is that Afton had seemingly tore them down to become to become… immortal? This is lore coming from the books, where he tears the robots down for “reminent” or something like that which somehow causes you to become immortal (I mean, if children posses the suits they were stuffed in, this isn’t too far fetched for the story), why he didn’t get their reminent right after killing them, I have no idea, maybe it only worked after they possessed something, idk, but either way, doing so caused the spirits of the kiddies ended up loose, and then cornered Afton down to a room, in which (I forgor whose spirit in specific) starts to chase hi around in. Now I didn’t mention this before, but I will now, Afton lured all the kiddies he killed by dressing up in the spring Bonnie costume, of which was a spring lock costume, which allowed for the robots endoskeleton to be removed and some stuff to be cranked back for enough space for a worker to get inside and preform, with also a huge risk of dying a horrible death. This very suit was in the room he was getting chased into, and for some reason he put it on for protection or something. Now, to explain it fully, animatronics have and endoskeleton of which has all the functioning stuff, and since the earliest version wasn’t as advanced as the others, and didn’t have the same fudged, they decided to make a mechanism [/spoiler]

The controls are extremely clunky oftentimes I lose fights not because of wrong reactions, but because for example a dodge automatically targets nearby enemies to jump over them resulting in dodging into a line of fire instead of out of it. Also traversal controls suck, gliding is something that's ingame but you're better off not using and the grapple hook is only usable when standing firmly on the ground below a potential grappling point. 

Also the loading of the game is pretty bad, sometimes you load in with random spikes jutting through things.

But the biggest issue is that it needs to be constantly online but somehow doesn't properly register your connectivity so even if you have stable connection it still might constantly put you back in the main screen because of dropped connection. This bug makes the game borderline unplayable sometimes.

That said, the voice acting and art style for most things are great, though the models lack expressiveness and often have very weird body language for the conversations being held, so if it's on sale and you have the patience to not always being able to play it when you wish to, it might be fun to play when it's on at least a 50% sale.",1698671407,1698671407,False,0,0,0.480769246816635132,0,True,False,False

The game's setting, Arkham Asylum itself, is a character in its own right. The eerie and foreboding atmosphere, combined with the Gothic architecture, makes for a perfect backdrop to this thrilling adventure. Exploring the asylum feels like a journey into madness, and it's filled with cleverly designed puzzles and hidden secrets.

The combat system is exceptional, allowing you to feel like the ultimate detective and martial artist. The fluidity of the combat, along with Batman's vast array of gadgets, keeps every encounter engaging and satisfying. The stealth gameplay is equally impressive, emphasizing the importance of strategy and cunning as you silently take down armed foes.

The story is where Arkham Asylum truly shines. It's a dark and gripping tale that brings together some of Batman's most iconic foes, with Mark Hamill's portrayal of the Joker being a standout performance. The voice acting and writing are top-notch, immersing you in a thrilling narrative that keeps you guessing at every turn.

The game's attention to detail and reverence for the source material is evident in every nook and cranny. Riddler trophies, patient interviews, and character profiles add depth to the experience, making you feel like the World's Greatest Detective.

In conclusion, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a must-play not only for Batman fans, but for anyone looking for a phenomenal gaming experience.

So upfront, I watched the live action show and cartoon as a kid, but beyond that I've not been huge into Batman since then, maybe that's my problem, but the amount of praise the game gets I'd expect it to hold up even without being invested in the franchise. Apparently not (for me at least).

If I had to use one word to summarise it all I'd say the game is ""Repetitive"" because so many times I found myself saying ""oh this, AGAIN"".

How many times do I need to fight enemies that need to be Batarang'ed as they charge, dodge and punch? How many times do I need to beat up wave after wave of random low level nobodies?
How many times do I need to fight [spoiler]Scarecrow[/spoiler]?

Honestly the idea that this game was a Game of the Year is more a damning statement about the quality of games the year it came out than about the quality of this game. I nearly uninstalled after the second [spoiler]Scarecrow[/spoiler] section because I just could not be bothered anymore, but I checked to see if I was anywhere near the end and apparently there wasn't too much left so I pushed on to see if it got any better and Jesus Christ the final boss fight was the most anti-climactic fight I think I have ever played.

The only thing I can think of that got this game so many good reviews (not just on Steam but in general) was because it was a super hero game and it was being judged against the quality of previous franchise tie in games.",1698518975,1698518975,False,4,0,0.539532363414764404,1,True,False,False

Of course, Batman's arch-enemy, Joker, is incarcerated here, and the story revolves around progressing through the prison, dealing with his henchmen and other super-villains such has Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy and Killer Croc.

The environments you move through are extremely well done, from the open spaces on the island between the prison buildings to the depths of the prison itself, which are dark, spooky and in some cases downright terrifying!  The Grapnel Gun allows freedom of movement to get to places where you can observe and plan your next encounter using your ""detective vision"".

You gain a formidable arsenal of toys to deal with you enemies, and they're all fun to play with.  The combat system allows you to chain together combos as you deal with groups of enemies.  It can be frustrating at times, but you soon get the hang of it.  The boss encounters will probably also take you several attempts as you learn the timing of their attacks, either countering with an attack of your own, or just getting out of the way!

Beyond the combat there are many collectables scattered across the game, including Joker Teeth, Riddler Trophies and interview tapes with some of Arkham's inmates.

I went back and played this game as I got it in a bundle on sale. I originally played this game back in 2012-ish and figured I'd give it a replay to see if it still holds up. It does, although the graphics are obviously a bit dated, it doesn't hold the game back at all as the voice acting and animations are still very well done. 

The gameplay is the tried and true 3rd person stealth/action beat-em-up that laid the formula for many successful franchises since. There are some gameplay and combat issues still present that  have  been cleaned up in more recent games that utilize the same mechanics, however it rarely becomes a major issue in the core gameplay loop.

I am not a DC fan (read as I really, really don't like DC), and I'm hardly interested in Batman. I am much more into Marvel (read as I really, really love Marvel). This game is borderline perfect. You don't have to be a Batman fan, just a fan of good video games to really enjoy Batman: Arkham Asylum. This game is from an era just before all the micro transaction/live services BS really started to take off and take hold of the mainstream market. It's a complete package from beginning to end with a solid amount of content that wraps up very nicely in the end. I got this game on sale for a meager 3 bucks, the price of a McChicken these days and had a blast. I bought it and gave it a shot more because I know the reputation it has and have heard great things about this game. Everyone was right, and I am horribly late to the party. 

Batman: Arkham Asylum is a metroidvania lite in a lot of good ways. This is a character action game first, and it really nails a good feel for the combat. The buttons make sense, the attacks thrown at you are well telegraphed, each combat encounter rewards your methodical approach rather than just button mashing. It feels great to control Batman. The developers did a great job of capturing ""feeling like Batman"". As you progress there will be areas and secrets inaccessible to you until you unlock certain equipment or upgrades. There is some clever back tracking, with a lot of surprising level design changes as you continue through your adventure. The enemy variety throughout the game is just right for the length of the total campaign and stayed fresh enough through my play through. Some combat encounters can be pretty boring, particularly against the over-sized brutes. But when you're fighting normal goons, exploring Arkham Asylum, and solving puzzles this game is amazing. The world design, art direction, and character acting are really good and serves to sell the immersion in a great way. Some cut-scene work is meh, but it never took away from enjoyment of the game and served just to be a quick stepping stone to the next thing.

I give Batman: Arkham Asylum a 9/10 and I can see my self coming back to play it again. The only thing really holding it back from a solid 10 is some of the combat encounters I could do without or should have been made more interesting. Otherwise, this is incredible game that everyone should give a play through.",1698094182,1698094182,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Some of the animations can't be stopped once you started them and can only be stopped until you wait the whole time or get hit by a goon. The guns are kinda op against Batman. 

SPOILER PART:
Boss fights were... Okay but needed more of everything. 
BANE: Bane is a pretty easy boss once you figure out what to do and what not to do, which makes sense cause he's the first boss.
Then they have like 5-6 bane remakes that you have to fight through the game which operate exactly like bane. Only difference between the drugged up goon fights and bane is that the drugged up goons normally have other goons with them. Got kinda boring having to keep fighting them.

SCARECROW: His ""Fights"" Are pretty much you running forward trying not to be seen by his light... That's pretty much it. You fight skeletons every so often, but they are easier to fight than goons. They also have skelly's that fight the same as jacked up goons, but are even easier to fight cause all you gotta do is dodge them once and they explode.

Harley Quinn: Legit just stay off the electro-floor and beat up goons.

CROC: Croc's fight is pretty much just walk on platforms (can't run or you'll die) And collect stuff. He'll pop up every so often, but all you gotta do is throw one batatararaang at him. I wouldn't really call it a boss fight.

IVY: Ivy has a lot of ""Power"" in  this game, and yet she's easy to fight. Legit dodge her easily dodge-able moves while spamming batarangs at her. Then place and explosive on her. You gotta do this whole things twice, but that's all her fight is.

JOKER: Joker's fight is by FAR the biggest JOKE of the whole game.. It's the last fight and yet is the easiest.... Like super easy.. He turns into a jacked joker and all you gotta to is dodge his attacks (like 5 attacks) then he will jump off the arena and send his men in. After spending like 1-2 mins killing his men, you pull him down and punch him. You do that whole thing 3 times. Doesn't get any harder tbh. You also get more health between the rounds, so it's even easier. 


That's the whole game, not very long. If you tried to speedrun it first time playing, you could beat it in 6h.
You could do it in that amount of time not speed running it, tbh. I got 8h while taking pause breaks and exploring. 


BUT, It wasn't bad and was good when it came out. Graphics aren't too old, game play isn't ... THAT bad, and batman still be doing bat things.",1698090198,1698090198,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was one of the few games where it truly felt like a huge generational leap from the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube era. The combat was unlike anything I've ever seen at the time, and was one of the main draws for me. The graphics still hold up even to this day, especially when you look up close to the characters like the Joker and the attention to detail with his facial features. This game does a magnificent job of making you feel like Batman, everything from the combat to the grappling to sneaking up behind enemies and knocking them out cold. All of the gameplay elements are fused together so beautifully - platforming, beat-em-up, puzzle solving, treasure hunt, stealth...there's never a dull moment. The music is top notch, and really adds to the dark and gritty atmosphere. To hear the legendary Kevin Conroy voice as Batman is like premium icing on the cake.

If that doesn't work, you may also need to download the .NET framework 3.5 from this link: [url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=21] finally, if that still doesn't work, install the PhysX system software found at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY\redist\",1697672026,1697904292,True,41,0,0.795929431915283203,2,True,False,False

Some glitches I came across:

1) Having to reload your saved file again when the game does not load the graphics correctly

2) The floating leaves that are supposed to be on the floor of the Arkham Aviary

Despite the minor glitches, I was able to finish the game. Other game modes, such as survival, challenges, etc., all worked like a charm with no issues.

Combat, while easy for me now as I have been playing through this game so many times(which probably should explain my liking for it), still offers a satisfying experience in superhero battle design. Stealth can be enjoyed too. I will say that it's not as dynamic as say, Splinter Cell(the original), as for example the player is unable to hide bodies and noise can be avoided at all the right time if you know when to stop running and when to crouch. It's a simple system of stealth considering stealth-based games I've played in the past. However, gunfire from the armed guards Batman is up against will always pack a punch to the player's HP, even if they manage to barely survive the stealth room by fighting their way through which I don't is possible? I mean, at least not very consistently. Of course, here's a pro tip, singling out the guards will leave the one defenseless and completely open to a trial by combat approach. Try not to be in their line of sight however if you want to do him a ""PERFECT K.O."". Overall, Batman:Arkham Asylum is a mechanically simple game when you narrow it down. Yet, it remains satisfying and there is also plenty of depth to be mined out of it. You will be punished appropriately if you approach groups of enemies incorrectly and sneaking can be heavily punished if done poorly. However, when those things are done right, it's incredibly satisfying. It always feels great whenever I am able to quickly and handily dismantle a room full of armed henchmen or defeat all enemies in an encounter with as little difficulty as possible. It, without question, can make you feel like Batman. Play it well, and you are for sure worthy of taking control of the Caped Crusader himself.

Arkham Asylum is such a gem of a game, especially for being 14 years old. The combat system is something that really defines the Batman games.

Batman Arkham Asylum is a cult classic, but hear my opinion on it as an outsider.
I like the old batman movies, but I wouldn't class myself as a batman fan.
Having said that, I found the game to be good, maybe not amazing, but definitely good enough to warrant a playthrough.
The gameplay is interesting and varied, you unlock new tools as you progress that give you more options for traversal and the ability to reach places that you couldnt before. It all uses the same map, but you just get higher levels of access with time.
The story is relatively simple, but there is a lot of fan service for people that have read the old comics, so this will be lovely for fans of batman (though one could argue that there maybe was a bit too much fan service? I'll leave that for you to decide). 
The graphics have aged like fine wine since the artstyle still feels very relevant for a comic book superhero game.

The only two real issues (albeit minor) I had were related to - the voice acting (seems like the audio captured was low bitrate or something else, but batmans voice specifically sounds scuffed) and the amount of one liner dialogue (honestly, a little cringe).

Having said all of that, I still enjoyed the game. It didn't overstay its visit, clocking in at around 12 hours for me (ignoring the idle time and bonus content) and was a nice change of cpace compared to big bombastic open world games of today.
You can usually get it at a huge discount as well so its a no brainer, give it a try!

COD MW2, Borderlands, Prototype, Assassin's Creed 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Batman Arkham Asylum... Bunlar şahsen benim oynayıp gördüklerim arasından. Ve hepsi hakkında düşüncelerim ne çok iyi ne de kötü oldukları yönünde. Yani 'iyiler ama o kadar' olduğunu düşündüğüm oyunlar. Arkham Asylum'da belirttiğim gibi bunlar arasında.

Hepimiz önceden bir Batman oyunu oynamışızdır bence. Ya NES'ten ya PS2'den hatta bazılarımız Kraloyundan vs illa bir şekilde oynamıştır. Ve hiçbiri de iyi oyunlar değiller. Hatta birçoğu rezalettir çoğumuza göre. Fakat 2008'de Rocksteady yaptı duyurusunu. Adamlar oyun dünyasında rezalet etki bırakmış olan Batman'in oyununu yapıyorlardı. Riskli ama temiz bir hareket oldu benim açımdan. Çünkü oyun iyi. Hikayesinden bahsetmek istemiyorum. Doğru düzgün hatırlamıyorum bile. Tek hatırladığım 11-12 saat boyunca Joker'in peşine vermemiz. Oyun boyunca Joker'in peşindeyiz. Ha arada başka düşmanlar da geliyor. Hatta baya düşman geliyor. Scarecrow, Killer Croc, Harley Quinn, Bane, Zsasz gibi bir sürü düşman var lakin oyunun bunlara ayırdığı süreyi toplasanız anca 1.5-2 saat eder. Düşman bakımından kadro geniş ama pek iyi değerlendirilmemiş. Zaten boss savaşları rezalet. Hatta bu saydıklarım arasından Bane ve Joker dışında boss savaşı denebilecek bir olay da olmuyor. Hatta ve hatta Joker'in boktan bossuna boss demek bile istemiyorum.

Neyse sakinleşip oynanışı anlatmaya çalışayım. Kusursuza yaklaşmış, ne kadar övsem azdır. Kombolar o kadar akıcı ve zevkli ki 4 köşe ediyor insanı oyunun başlarında. Gizlilik kısımlarını aksiyon kısımlarından bile daha güzel buldum. Upgrade sistemi hiç fena değil. Oldukça iyi. Batman'in alet edevatları da ayrı bi tad katıyor tabii oynanışa. Bunu oynamayan bir insanın oyunların genel gameplay'ine bakış açısı, etsiz çiğköfteye benzer. Bulmacalar, yan görevler, challenge'lar derken oyunun 15-20 saatlik ömrü var. Yine de Spirit of Amadeus Arkham yan görevinin sonunda hayal kırklığına uğradığımı belirtmek isterim. O kadar saat harcadığıma değmedi şahsen o göreve.

Ve seslendirmeler... İşte bu kusursuz. Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroy, Tara Strong... En iyi seslendirmecileri toplamışlar resmen.

Güzel güzel. Puan verecek olsam:

The game’s mature themes and intricate storyline were a refreshing change from the often simplistic storytelling found in many modern games.

The game’s mechanics are well-designed, striking a good balance between challenge and accessibility. The combat system is intuitive and deep, allowing for strategic planning and execution. The stealth elements are particularly satisfying, requiring patience and careful observation.

The graphics are impressive, even years after its initial release. The dark and gritty atmosphere of Arkham Asylum is beautifully rendered, immersing you in the world of Batman. The attention to detail in the environment and character designs adds depth to the gaming experience.

The voice acting is top-notch, with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and Joker, respectively. Their performances add authenticity to the game and enhance the narrative.

However, as an older player, I found some aspects of the game to be a bit challenging. The fast-paced combat sequences can sometimes be overwhelming, especially during boss fights. Additionally, some puzzle elements require quick reflexes, which can be a bit tricky for some older gamers.

Despite these challenges, I appreciate the game’s difficulty settings, which allow you to customize the gameplay experience to your skill level. This feature makes the game accessible to players of all ages and abilities.

In conclusion, Batman: Arkham Asylum - Game of the Year Edition for PC is an incredibly well-crafted game that offers a rich narrative, engaging gameplay mechanics, and stunning visuals. It’s a game that caters to its mature audience and provides a rewarding experience for those willing to immerse themselves in its dark and complex world.

Batman Arkham Asylum's graphics look surprisingly good for a game that is this old. Characters have great designs that clearly showcase their personalities. The animations in this game also look pretty good. Sound design is pretty great. Hearing the crunches and cracks as you beat up enemies is greatly satisfying. Music here is really good as well and switch very smoothly from one another. The atmosphere presented by asylum is absolutely amazing and truly makes you feel the brutality of where you are. The art for this game is also pretty good.

Gameplay is good, but there are some flaws here and there. The combat is great, as it makes you feel like a dangerous martial artist. Attacks feel heavy and satisfying. Inputs are responsive, but sometimes when you throw a punch, Batman will just randomly swing a punch in the air when there is an enemy right next to him. The stealth sections are by far the best part of this game. Using your gadgets to gain an advantage over enemies and seeing their heart rate increase as the odds get turned against them truly makes you feel like a dangerous skilled assassin. Unfortunately these sections are few and far in between. The boss fights in this game are a mixed bag tho. Bane is way to simple to be fun, Killler Croc is way too easy, and the joker is just three waves of enemies. The only good boss is poison ivy. Puzzles are alright. Most of the puzzles that you will be solving is finding Riddler trophies. Luckily these are optional and they aren't as annoying and as common as they are in the rest of the series.

The story here is alright. Characters are interesting and well voiced by their voice actors. Unfortunately the overall story is a bit generic and weird decisions are often made by characters in the game. My favorite part though is the lore set up by this universe. The tapes that you collect during the game lets you listen to a therapy session that the villains went through and they are absolutely amazing and give you a great idea of how these characters think.

Overall, while there are some flaws here and there, this game is still really good and holds up quite well today, but don't expect it to be as good as the other games in the series.",1696970983,1696970983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Batman: Arkham Asylum is an absolute triumph in the world of video games, offering a thrilling and immersive experience that does justice to the iconic Dark Knight. From the moment I started playing, I was captivated by its gripping narrative, stunning visuals, and impeccable gameplay.

One of the standout features of Arkham Asylum is its exceptional storytelling. The game kicks off with Batman delivering the Joker to Arkham Asylum, but things quickly spiral out of control as the Clown Prince of Crime takes over the facility. The plot is filled with unexpected twists, keeping players on the edge of their seats throughout the game. The dialogue and voice acting are top-notch, with Mark Hamill's Joker and Kevin Conroy's Batman delivering unforgettable performances that rival their work in the animated series.

Visually, Arkham Asylum is a masterpiece. The attention to detail in the asylum's dark and foreboding corridors, as well as in Batman's suit and gadgets, is outstanding. The character models are incredibly lifelike, and the animation is smooth, which enhances the overall immersion.

The gameplay in Arkham Asylum is where the game truly shines. The combat system is both accessible to newcomers and rewarding for veterans, allowing players to feel like the caped crusader as they seamlessly chain together combos and counterattacks. Batman's arsenal of gadgets is vast and enjoyable to use, whether it's the grappling hook, batarangs, or the detective vision that lets you investigate crime scenes. The stealth mechanics are equally engaging, making it just as satisfying to stalk and subdue enemies in the shadows as it is to engage in all-out brawls.

The game also provides ample opportunities for exploration and puzzle-solving. The Riddler's challenges scattered throughout the island add an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, encouraging players to use their detective skills to solve riddles and collect trophies.

In addition to the main story, the game offers a plethora of side missions and unlockable content that extends its replayability. Arkham Asylum provides a rich and immersive experience that keeps players coming back for more.

In conclusion, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a triumph of game design and a must-play for both Batman fans and gamers in general. Its compelling narrative, stunning visuals, and impeccable gameplay combine to create an unforgettable experience that truly captures the essence of the Dark Knight. If you haven't experienced this masterpiece yet, do yourself a favor and dive into the world of Arkham Asylum; you won't be disappointed.",1696835272,1696835272,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

35140,35580564,76561197998455537,0,804,750,0,750,1507545658,"I loved it. While I did not play the Batman : Arkham series by Rocksteady Games in the proper order, I must say that I enjoyed the game. Perhaps, it's the world of Batman that has evolved over the years to give a sense of coolness. Originally created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, the Arkham series is a far cry from the comical hijinks of the 1960s TV series and its silly ""nena-nena-nena-nena-nena-nena-nena-nena-Batman"" jingle (Yes, there are 8 nenas, I counted). The characters no longer take on the comical TV villain and are now fleshed out as the hardened versions as written by Paul Dini. The design of the characters in the Arkham series is solid. The villains take centre stage when they lose their cartoonish image and have a more ""hardened criminal"" look and feel. 

Gameplay-wise, you will find that it is similar throughout the series. In Arkham Asylum, you will lack the ability to free fly around the map but it's not much of an issue. Some of the most ridiculous things tend to be the duck walking through vents. As you know, ventilation ducts do not support an adult human male's weight. It is a common issue with Square Enix games like Deus Ex. It is like a running joke but whatever. The human sized ventilation ducts is kind of their thing now. It's the kind of thing that makes you go, ""WTF, oh it must be Square Enix again!"". Combat is simple and easy to pick up in all the series, just press left-click and right click at the correct times while facing the right direction and enemies go down. Sometimes, you wish that you could turn off the lights and play stealth or use smoke bombs (like in the cartoon series).

Conclusion, do try the entire series from start to end as the Batman : Arkham games progress in a linear fashion (Don't be too caught up with the word ""linear"", most good vs evil stories are linear). It's the first in the series and it helps to build up the story.

Note: Rocksteady Games is a British video game developer based in Kentish Town, London. It was founded by Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker. It is majority owned by Time Warner with Square Enix (Eidos Interactive) holding roughly 25%.

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. Arkham Character Design
I loved it. It's the most interesting Batman design out of all the various permutations of Batman.

2. Arkham Story
I played the Arkham series not in the proper order but the story was great. Telling the dark history of Arkham was great too.

3. Riddler Puzzles
Those riddles were pretty good. The trophy pick up sucked.

4. History of Arkham
I loved that part too.

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. Bugs
Some parts of the game require prior steps in order to proceed. However, the game skips steps and halts the games progress, forcing you to go back to comple a step. E.g. Dr Young's fingerprints scan can be skipped first.

2. Repetitive Mechanics
Every single Titan is just Bane. Charge, Batarang, jump out of the way, crash. Rinse and repeat. You wonder if Bane was even a boss fight?

3. No Batmobile and Batwing
It's the expectation.

4. Riddler Trophies
I don't really enjoy picking up question marks and having to ask how they got there in the first place. It destroys the whole story and the game logic. Like how and why does Riddler manage to put trophies on a rock outcrop? Or why does he place them behind a weakened structural wall? It feels like a very lazy way of just creating pick ups in the map.

5. Joker Teeth
They do absolutely nothing but chatter. Couldn't they explode when you step on them or warn the goons that you're near? You just hit them for achievement purposes.

[h1][b]NEUTRAL[/b][/h1]
1. Combat
You must take out all the enemies. Why can't you choose not to? There's a level where you can access the security system out of range of the enemies. Why do I need to KO every single one of them?

[h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]
1. Turning off the Lights
That's how it's supposed works for Batman, right? ""I am the terror that flaps in the night!""

2. Improved Riddler Puzzles
In the story, you could make it so that Riddler could be playing both sides. He's helping out both Batman and villains but he's profiting from it. He wants to be the real mastermind, which is in character. I'd prefer this to the whole childish playground, ""I'm smarter than you"" gag.

3. Gadgets
Try to combine them into one. The high-powered Batclaw is a great idea. You have a whole arsenal of weapons that you can create.

4. Playin as the villains
After watching the Joker DLC, I would love to play the villains in the game. That is an entire list of content to play with. Can you imagine Scarecrow, Croc or Penguin modes? However, not interested in paying for DLC. It could even link to multiplayer modes for longevity.",1507488548,1696756282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All those things I mentioned are all good in this game, but when you play the sequels; looking back on Arkham Asylum just doesn't feel the same as when you first played it.

There are some things  in my opinion that haven't been upgraded upon. That to me is the Scarecrow fights and the 3rd wall breaks. I know they've been similarly done in Origins and Knight, but I think that Asylum did a fantastic job on these parts. The Riddler challenges are fine but also boring; not much of a challenge; its really just you going back to places you've already been, but with more items.

Given the quality of games these days, in the fine year of 2023, it's truly hard to believe that this game came out in 2009. I missed this game on release because I was a broke college student, but have memories of everyone saying how good it was. And they were right! They're still right! This game aged remarkably and hearkens back to an era when we were drowning in solid new releases. An era that would soon be coming to an end. 

[h1]Where to Begin...[/h1]

There is so much to praise about this game: Fluid combat and movement. Good mix of combat, puzzle solving and platforming. Insanely good atmosphere. Great takes on classic Batman villains. Not too short, not too long. There's not a whole lot to really complain about (and I'll get to that). It's an all around good, engrossing experience that begs you to keep playing.

Back in 2009, [i]Arkham Asylum[/i] introduced an innovative combat system. Everything was streamlined. No complicated combos to memorize. Everything was contextualized. By doing this, players can easily take 
 control of Batman and acrobatically beat the pulp out of Joker's thugs. It just feels right as you see Batman effortlessly gliding through and between enemies, delivering punches left and right, occasionally having to counter, throwing the occasional baterang - or three. It all holds up nearly 15 years later. 

As the world's greatest detective, you'll also be challenged to solve puzzles, mysteries, and riddles. This is again another area Rocksteady streamlined. Anytime you need to figure something out, you just go into detective mode and stuff gets highlighted. Admittedly, this got stale after a while, but the middle ground would be tough to find. If you make puzzles too challenging, a lot of players will get frustrated and quit. If you dumb it down anymore, you remove the challenge all together. It gives you something to do where you can put in minimal effort and get rewarded. For [i]Arkham Asylum[/i], it needs some mechanic like this, as otherwise there would be no incentive to explore the island.

Lastly, I want to throw some praise at the atmosphere and mood of this game. Arkham is a dark place. There is not one trace of anything other than evil and depravity. As you explore the asylum, you pick up interviews with inmates and messages from the founder. From these stories it becomes immediately clear that there are no good guys at Arkham. Coupled with the detailed environments around the island, which were clearly inspired by psychiatric hospitals c.1930, exploring the asylum fills one with a sense of unease.

[h1]Minor Criticisms[/h1]

There isn't much bad to be said about this game, at least not from a design perspective. Fights with the Titan Henchmen, for example, were easily the weakest part of the game. One is introduced early on and then they aren't seen again for a while. The basic premise of these fights is simple, but they include my least favorite mechanic: Waiting.

The Titan Henchmen fight cycle is as follows:
-Wait for Titan to charge
-Quick throw baterang and dodge
-Titan hits wall, gets disoriented
-Avoid and wait for Titan to go back to normal state
-Repeat until you can knock him out

It's a lot of waiting. And then you get sections where there are multiple Titans, or multiple Titans with 10 other basic henchmen. In these cases when you knock a Titan down you can at least ride it and make it thrash around and hit enemies, but even then it's not that satisfying.

Having said all that, while I was playing I realized that nevertheless, the design choice to make you square off against 2 Titans and 10 henchmen is interesting in theory. To fight a Titan you have to wait. But you can't wait when you 10 guys all trying to attack you at once.  I really commend the idea of making a player perform 2 diametrically opposed tasks at the same time. Love the idea. Hated it in practice.

The only other issues I had were technical and I chalk them up to this game being old. Problems I experienced:
-Game freezing at start menu, forced restart
-Occasional bad input lag
-Stopped getting achievements for some reason

[h1]Overall[/h1]

Solid game. Definitely recommend. Still amazing to me that this, a game that came out in 2009, looks, runs, and feels better than pretty much everything that's come out in the last 10 years. [b]8/10.[/b]",1694485350,1695734658,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Arkham City fixes that issue a bit, except that it kind of does it by way of adding a bunch of grindy side missions. That said, I'd much rather solve Riddler's puzzles in City over searching through all of Arkham Asylum again. I really hated the map design and found Asylum kind of a chore to navigate. At times, it kind of made me want to quit and move on to City.

The aesthetic of the game holds up, even ten years later. This game is truly a piece of art, and I don't think many games are like that. The mechanics are pretty good, just unrefined. You can see why City became so much better. Directional jumping is problematic in this game, which is mostly fine... except that there are a few platforming sections where it's really bothersome.

The one area where this game has City beat is in its story, which I think is way more interesting. Joker gets himself locked into Arkham Asylum, escapes, and begins reaping havoc. That story is way more interesting than City, which is a kind of half-baked superhero plot about Strange trying to control Arkham City/Gotham. I also think that there are too many enemy types in City. But that's for a different review.

All in all, this is a great game that's worth playing. It's just definitely NOT worth collecting all of the Riddler trophies because it's not worth working your way through the maze-like map.

This game (and its sequel) is one of them. 14 years later and this game still eclipses every single other superhero game out there. This is comfortably the best superhero game ever made. It is one of the best action games ever made. Its influence is still widely seen today.

Every once in a while a game comes along that innovates, changes up how things work, changes up gaming in general (e.g. Dark Souls - Soulslike genre). Arkham Asylum did just that back in 2009. Shortly after its release, we saw the first copycats emerge in the form of Shadow of Mordor and Mad Max, nowadays by the Spiderman games. All these games are imitators of the original. Not so impressive.

On top of that innovation, it still holds up visually, because of the stellar art design. Then you have the great stealth combat, the metroidvania level design that encourages backtracking, the immersive atmosphere, the excellent narrative, the fantastic character design, it all culminated into a true masterpiece and one of the very few games in existence that genuinely deserves a 10/10 score.",1694749664,1694749664,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

We get to see Arkham Asylum in all its gothic grotesquery, sneak around choking out perps dressed in tights and if that fails beating up hordes of working class goons that never got a fair chance to break the mold and join the wealthy middle class of Gotham.. The island where the titular Arkham Asylum is located is quite a sandbox filled with nooks and crannies where you can lurk upon your enemies or find the hidden psycho-paraphernalia. The story is nothing fantastic but fits the bill.. Joker gets put under lock and key, but wait! It was a master plan all along and now he controls the asylum! Luckily ManBat happens to be right there to save the day! On the way we run into a brief yet regular entourage of famous villains and monsters from the comics. It didn't bother me even though I always find body morphology in these kinds of games jaring..  

So yea, Batman Arkham Asylum is a great game and if nothing else a damn fine example of a stealth game done right. Combine that with a fluent, almost rhythm game based combat that looks truly cinematic at times and you get a dark and brooding ballet of chokeholds, batarangs, anti-shark sprays and mighty roundhouse kicks that put Chuck Norris to shame. If you like Batman on top of it all, I imagine it is even better. It’s always great to find a game that acknowledges the sneaky rat that lives in my brain!

The first game in the action-brawler Arkham series, laying the foundation on which the other three games are built. The controls may not be as sophisticated and polished as in the later games, but everything has to start somewhere. The combat is not my favourite part of the game, but the Dark Knight's movement and the gadgets feel absolutely awesome. The story is fascinating, with lots of little twists and turns, and features one of the most mind-bending 4th wall-breaking scenes in the entire gaming industry (Scarecrow's fear toxin).

[u]Recommended if:[/u] You like a dark detective story, an interesting take on well-known comic characters, and if you want to meet your favourite comic characters animated and voiced with a great attention to detail.

Being the prototype and the blueprint of free flow combat it requires polish and some finesse. You get to have a pure skill if you want to go to a combo of 50 along with other aspects the traversal is also weak which is a minor gripe of mine as it harbors a metroidvania esque level design but overall this game is a masterpiece and ideal piece for the developers of the new gnereation.

While I played on keyboard and mouse (without the option to remap keys), the game felt well enough to play and enjoy, still I would recommend using a controller.
The idea of having real riddles to solve and not only puzzles or mini games really made you feel like a detective… most of the time.

There was no yank apart from the odd getting stuck in geometry, but it never became a problem.
And while sometimes it felt like Batman had a mind of his own doing stuff unprompted or the wrong prompt thing being done, apart from it breaking a perfectly good combo or leaving an open for my enemies to attack me, I didn't rage as much as I thought I would so it wasn't that disruptive.",1693861575,1693861575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game starts amazing but the second you finish the fight with Bane the game recycles the Bane bossfight literally up until the end (like 6 times in total iirc). Scarecrow bossfight is mid af, sneak walking sim. Poison Ivy was the most ""unique"" but stereotypical bossfight with wait and attack and Killer Croc was just sneak simulator with the occasional quicktime event.

Definitly would'nt recommend the game honestly, just watch all cutscenes on youtube if you want the story imo.

[h1]Action[/h1]

One of the best first installation of an action adventure series in recent years, adapted from comics no less! The freeflow combat system (originated from the Arkham series) is already perfected in this first game. You also get some gadgets for personalised fighting styles. Scripted stealth events and investigations are more emphasised in the first game during which you have to use the Detective Mode for clues, but the mode is so powerful (you can see through all obstacles, find all the thugs in the room and the clues are highlighted) that I think all players spend most of time in it.

This game might not be as polished as its sequel Arkham City. The way I see it, Asylum is made for hardcore Batman fans while City is made for mainstream gamers. The attention to detail is amazing: like the art style and animations of the characters, which are very faithful to the original work. The game is dark and is designed to make you feel isolated and helpless in a locked down Asylum.

I would heartily recommend this game to anyone, not just fans of Batman.",1393700571,1693336958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That might sound like hyperbole, but I assure you that everything comes close to making a perfect game.

You don't need to be a Batman fanatic to enjoy this, it'll show you all that you need to understand Batman, his allies and his enemies. The characterization on display is flawless with what it works with. Further, it does it without stopping the game and doing a lore dump on you. The people and their reactions to each other tells you everything.

The combat is the right amount of hectic. The different varieties of enemy have a good amount of variety while still being a reasonable challenge. Rifles, fists, stun batons...lunatics, maximum security inmates, hulking mutants, mutant plants...it all sounds like it should fall apart under its weight, but the game keeps things varied, interesting and, most importantly, doable. Beautiful...

Arkham Asylum might just be the best Metroidvania, too. The map isn't ridiculously huge, but it seems vast and imposing enough when you start. The story masterfully takes you through different locations and, as you get more gear and hence ""unlock"" new areas, it'll take you back through many places. Further, it'll keep things fresh as the island you're on steadily falls further into chaos through the night.

It isn't perfect or flawless, nothing is, but Arkham Asylum is must-play gaming. Nothing less. Any clunk or frustration is mitigated by a forgiving checkpoint system and fun gameplay, glued together with an interesting and engaging story.

It's an absolute gem in my Steam library and I believe it can be for your collection as well.",1693060615,1693060615,True,1,0,0.506972670555114746,0,True,False,False

I start the review this way because this is the most important thing to remember when you're playing this game. This game started the entire ""counter-punch"" system of combat that games to this day still use. And it feels almost as good in this game as it does in any of the games that copy it's design, even games made almost a decade and a half later.

There's a ton of great things to say here about the game. The story is a classic Batman romp. The graphics are great for the time. The voice acting, especially by Hamill and Conroy (RIP), is beyond amazing. And the music is just timeless. There's even a million and one collectables to collect if that's your thing.

But the biggest thing this game gets right is none of that. It's that this game makes you FEEL like Batman. You're big, your punches have weight. You are a complete badass. You can sneak and be stealthy terror. You can deduce (Detective Vision is yet another way this game shaped the industry, for the worse IMO, but still). You have an array of useful gadgets. But eventually you'll HAVE to punch. And when you punch, you feel the power behind those fists.

And that's truly this game's biggest strength. Which makes it the biggest weakness from a modern perspective as well. This combat has been done better since. Of course it has. Companies have had almost 14 years to perfect it. But that should in no way diminish this game or what it accomplished and in no way means you shouldn't still play this classic.

The Batman Arkham franchise is without a doubt one of the best video game franchises ever to be made. It has set the bar for so many games like it such as the recent spider-man games as well as non-superhero games such as Shadow of Mordor. The games story, while basic in the eyes of comic fans and superhero enthusiasts, is a solid way to introduce the characters, world, and lore in a way thar is a breath of fresh air for Batman fans. The gameplay and characters really build this game up in ways that I haven't seen done quite as well since. While some aspects such as the sometimes rigid ways the combat system throws you at enemies or the infamous poison Ivy Boss fight didn't age quite as well they don't hurt the game enough to do anything.

This is the shortest Arkham game, but it's also the densest. Small map, but full of life.

Worst part of the game is Poison Ivy. Her chapter of the story is easily the worst because it has a bunch of the most tedious parts of the game all in a row (The slow as hell sewer level with Killer Croc, the orb spitting plants, several sections that make you backtrack to places that you already explored). 

Also, her entire character is just ""sex appeal"" and ""Wa hah hah I want to take over the city because I am evil"". Her boss fight is awful, too. 

Alternatively, Harley is a fantastic character and I really wish they did more with her. I felt legitimately bad for her at certain moments in the game. Wish they had done less with Ivy and more with her.

And of course Joker is great, his chatter over the Arkham intercom is funny and never gets old. Scarecrow is great, too.",1595603944,1692327446,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First let me start by saying I am not a DC/Marvel or Super Hero fan at all, I don't like any of them and I don't enjoy any of their origins or stories. Except Batman Begins and Tim Burton Batman films I did not find any of them anything interesting and I have never read the comics.

Let's start with the positive:
The game has an old school feeling, it doesn't guide you to do everything step by step like most modern games and you do need to do some exploration yourself which is something that is missing in modern gaming cause every path and objective is always marked 10000 times to make sure even if you are blind you still see it and won't lose your way to it.

The scarecrow encounters. These encounters are actually brilliant, it gives you a completely different type of old school 2D platformer feeling in the middle of a 3rd person game and it is basically fantastic and shows a really good game/level design behind it.

The levels that all the enemies are armed with guns forces you to find a stealth pattern to take them out in correct order and it also gives a lot of creativity to the player which is really impressive.

And that is pretty much where the positive ends.

To the negative:
1. Close combat is pain in the butt (I played the game on hardest mode) it is extremely punishing if you do one incorrect move during combat and that being said it actually is a good thing but the problem begins with the game not registering your input correctly when you wanna do something else and it does something else and you end up dying to an action you never wanted to make at first place.
The close combat moves are really simple and boring and repetitive. There is only one attack button and one parry button and guess what... NO BLOCK button! Yes you heard me right, in a game that is mainly based on melee combat you do not have ANY block button.

Now let's compare other games like Metal Gear Rising to this, that game has stealth but it is not the focus, it is mainly and only designed for close combat and it is older than this game. You have maybe 10 different attack moves and 3 different defensive moves in addition of block button and parry button. And each of them on bound to different inputs not ONE for everything like this hot garbage Batman game here.

2. Locomotion and movement is extremely terrible. Batman is always in ""slow walk"" mood, you are in middle of boss fight and well his default walking style is ""slow walk"" you need to press that sprint button with all your fingers to make sure this batbaby starts to run. And that is if you do not get hit by some goon and get a ""hit reaction"" which resets you back to ""slow walk"" mood and then another goon comes and hits you again and half of the game boss fight turns to you fighting your keyboard to make this sprint work.

3. Level design and boss fights are extremely repetitive. I basically gave up the game right before Poison Ivy boss fight and watched the rest on YouTube to see the story. You get a boss fight with Bane and literally the rest of the boss fights except Ivy is exactly the same, some titan goon attacks you and 20000 minions spawn. Even the final boss fight is the same, Joker turns to titan and the same story again he sends his goons you need to fight the same guys over and over again until you have opportunity to attack himself then repeat for 3 more times.

4. Story: I honestly did not understand anything about the story but maybe it is because I have no idea about DC universe.",1691881987,1692230362,False,3,0,0.480401158332824707,0,True,False,False

The story, admittedly, reinforced the reasons I don't generally care for the genre (vapid 'good' and 'bad' with flimsy backstories which fail to introduce any sense of moral ambiguity, with villains acting that way because ""they're fuckin' mental innit mate"". With that being said, my view on that probably shouldn't be of interest to fans of the franchise, or comics/superheroes generally, and I did enjoy passages about alteration of perception/loss of sanity involving the Scarecrow character.

What you do have is an extremely solid action-stealth-fighter thing which caused my eight-hour playthrough to pass in a single sitting without me noticing it had become 2am. It's unusual for games to do all of those aspects well so the fact that you have stealth which feels rewarding when you get it right, intuitive and punchy (no pun intended) fighting mechanics and boss fights which feel (mostly) unique without inventing entirely new mechanics for the player to use is a real positive.

It's not a long game, but being £14.99 when it's not on sale, it provides excellent VFM nevertheless. For those inclined there are collectables (with discoverable maps hinting at where they are and removing markers when found - I am now going to be disappointed whenever a game has collectables without a system like this), as well as an infinite challenge mode to play wish associated achievements.

In general, normal difficulty is probably a little on the easy side - I died/failed less than a dozen times during my playthrough and I'm far from an expert - but it also is worth noting that if a player wants to start on hard difficulty (which appears to just be a question of damage scaling), completion achievements dependent on difficulty unlock for every difficulty up to the highest one at once.

Remember that time you thought you'd take a vacation to a lovely, tranquil island? Well, scrap that idea and get ready for a heart-pounding, cape-swirling escapade in Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition!


Pros:
🦸‍♂️ Be the Bat: Finally, a chance to channel your inner Bruce Wayne without having to worry about keeping your billionaire status under wraps. Kick, punch, and glide your way through the craziest inhabitants Gotham's nut-house has to offer.

🔍 World's Greatest Detective: Embrace your inner Sherlock Holmes (or should I say Bat-detective?) as you analyze crime scenes, solve puzzles, and stalk your prey using an advanced Bat-tech gadgetry. Say goodbye to boring evenings of tea and crumpets – you're on the case!

👊Masterful Combat: Ever wanted to take on a room full of baddies and emerge victorious? Batman's combat system is like a symphony of fists and gadgets, where you're the conductor. It's so satisfying, you'll wonder why you haven't been spending your evenings patrolling the streets in real life.

🧩 Riddles and Enigmas: The Riddler isn't just here for the puns; he's got a collection of brain-teasers and puzzles that'll keep your intellect sharp. From finding hidden question marks to solving intricate riddles


Cons:
🎭 Joker Wants an Encore: The Joker's a charismatic villain, no doubt, but after hearing the same punchlines for the umpteenth time, you'll start contemplating giving up your Bat-hearing just to escape the repetition.

35140,143575407,76561199033220266,81,7,767,0,767,1691292007,"I actually rank Arkham Asylum above City because I think everything City did, Knight did better. However both City and Knight don't replicate the experience that is Arkham Asylum.

Rocksteady had originally wanted to start their Batman series with something in the scope of City but Warner Brothers had them scale down to prove themselves first. Within these constraints, Rocksteady settled on the idea of Gotham's infamous Asylum. Because they couldn't create the open world they wanted, they had to wring and squeeze every ounce of content out of this loony bin. And the most suitable game design direction for this was the Metroidvania.

Asylum being a Metroidvania seperates it from the rest of the Arkham series into its own little niche, Nowhere in the rest of the trilogy/quadrilogy do you get an experience quite like this. Throughout the course of this game, which should take on average about 10-12hrs, you will watch the island evolve and adapt as you venture to reclaim it from its tyrants. Poison Ivy will engulf the island in plants and vines, lunatic patients will rush and pounce you, Joker's snipers sweep from the towers, there's never a moment when the island feels static. And with the player backtracking a lot during those 10-12hrs, it better not be.

Atmosphere is important and Asylum isn't lacking. The asylum itself is richly detailed and its level/room design seamlessly interwoven. Asylum is always changing things up so that you never get bored. You'll be stalking a room of goons from gargoyles, escaping the twisted world of Scarecrow, avoiding the jaws of Killer Croc in the sewers, or taking down waves of enemies aiming to knock the lights out of Gotham's savior. Walking around this claustrophobic, creepy ass place as its one and only hope is a feeling you won't get tired of. Especially with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill as Batman and Joker. This dynamic acting duo really sell the Batman experience with their incredible performances. The game is also chock full of Batman references, collectibles, and easter eggs that fans of all kinds will greatly enjoy.

The game's prized exhibition is its gameplay, especially the combat. We're pretty spoiled nowadays but even now, having Batman's belt at your disposal along with his FreeFlow, bone crunching punches and kicks is incredibly satisfying. The Predator system along with the Bat's gadgets allow the player freedom of expression to take down rooms as they see fit. The progression of unlocking gadgets is well paced and never makes the player feel like they couldn't have played without them; only better with them.

The game does have some downsides and that's only because the later entries just kept getting better. Movement for example is not as fluid as City or Knight. Things like not being able to grapple or dive while you're gliding or the cape having a delay before fanning out after you jump from a cliff/ledge become immediately noticeable to veterans. This also applies to some combat, like the combo takedown animations in FreeFlow being uncannily slow, as well as ground takedowns taking way too long. The combat does feel great, but if you've played later entries, you'll notice that it'll feel a little stiff. Not a bad thing however, because this is Rocksteady level of stiff, which is nitpick status.

I highly recommend you play Arkham Asylum, along with the rest of the Arkham series if you haven't, because each game is better than the last and are prime examples of masterful craftsmanship with visible love for the source material. I recommend you play this game with the Arkham Reborn 4K textures as it'll give this game a much needed face lift as well as color correcting the game to get rid of that god awful green tint that plagued the vanilla version. There are guides on how to do that in the community tab. This game and the rest of the Arkham games go on sale fairly often for a ridiculously cheap price (I got the trilogy for like $6) so you should definitely pick them up.",1691396355,1691396355,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Since I had already played City before Asylum, the game felt a bit slow in the beginning, but after the first hour, I got used to it, and this didn't affect my enjoyment of the game. This fact is evident from the completion of all achievements.

Retinal Pleasure or Art: The game takes place in a mental hospital. Yes, there is a garden and a small cave outside the hospital, but overall, it takes place in a hospital. It does not require an additional mod as the textures are still manageable. I especially liked the colors in the places where you play with Batman's mind and remember his past. Even the designs of the cells of the lunatics and Calendar Man are very beautiful. After seeing the costumes in the new games, this game may seem a bit dull, but it does not stand out because it fits the game very well.

Mechanics: Subsequent games use the mechanics from Arkham Asylum. This game received a lot of praise, especially for its close combat mechanics, showcasing Batman as a master fighter. It is also excellent in stealth, featuring a Dishonored-style stealth system rather than the typical Thief-style. Even when Batman runs, enemies don't hear him; the key is to stay in their blind spots and take them down silently. Additionally, Batman can crawl from under grates, adding more tactical options. Moreover, the game offers a variety of gadgets that provide great diversity. Although they may be slightly slower compared to the later games in the series, they are quite good for the first game in the series. The sections where you follow compounds using Detective Vision are particularly well done. Moreover, the game offers a variety of gadgets that provide great diversity. Although they may be slightly slower compared to the later games in the series, they are quite good for the first game in the series. The sections where you follow compounds using Detective Vision are particularly well done. Furthermore, gliding is already a beautiful feature on its own. Even though we may not use gliding during combat, gliding was nice for stealth and exploring the map.

Atto Finale: The game is not expensive and despite being released in 2010, it is still beautiful. Just get the game and play. If you're a bit of a geek, you'll see nice little dialogues when you collect all the collectibles in the game.",1690077415,1690077415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Oyunun bir Batman hikayesi olarak aşırı zayıf olduğunu yine de vurgulamam gerek. Çizgi romanlarının yakaladığı diyalog kalitesinden bu kadar uzak olması şaşırttı. Oyundaki kadın temsillerinin eril olduğunu da eklemek zaruri.

Batman'in yeteneklerinin gelişimini çok keyifsiz birkaç zoraki yan göreve bağlamak da kötü bir tercih olmuş.

The hand-to-hand combat feels so satisfying and crisp split up with engaging invisible predator segments allowing you to exploit Batman's diverse equipment and abilities.

Arkham Asylum is not the best game I’ve ever played. Do I recommend it? Sure… as a lead-in to bigger story. Nice graphics, free-flow combat and some neat Bat-gadgets to use, even has Riddler’s “riddles”. Oh and Harley. Love Harley.

Story is fine. Just told through a series of fetch quests, “plot twists” and fights with Joker’s henchmen (climb a table to see AI in action!) right in front of your next objective. Bosses are either “environment-friendly” like Ivy (she needs more screen time honestly) or tedious like Bain. Scarecrow is… what do you call it? Crazy? But creative a lot more than others. And there is Croc, a special green cookie in an assorted cookie jar, crusty and toothy and, oh well… I’ll let you see for yourself.

BATMAN
INT. TRADITIONAL BATCAVE

BATMAN stands next to his batmobile and uses his batcomputer. He's sometimes Bruce Wayne sometimes Batman. Alltimes orphan.
BATMAN

This is now a safe city. I have punched a penguin into prison.

ALFRED, Batman's loyal batler, carries a tray of goth ham.
ALFRED

Eat a dinner, Mattress Wayne.

An explosion explodes. THE JOKER and TWO-FACE enter the cave. Joker is a clown but insane. Two-Face is a man but attorney.
BATMAN

No! It is Two-Face and One-Face. They hate me for being a bat.

Batman throws Alfred at Two-Face. Two-Face flips Alfred like a coin. Alfred lands heads up which means Two-Face goes home.
BATMAN (CONT'T)

It is just you and I, the Joker. Bat versus clown. Moral enemies.
THE JOKER

I am such a freak. Society is bad. You drink water, I drink anarchy.
BATMAN

I drink bats just like a bat would!

Batman looks around him for his parents, but they are still dead. This makes him have anger. He fires a batrocket. The Joker deflects it with his sick sense of humor. A clownly power.
THE JOKER

I have never followed a rule. That is my rule. Do you follow? I don't.
BATMAN

Alfred, give birth to Robin.

Alfred begins the process since it is his job. The joker now has a present in his hand. He juggles it over to Batman.
THE JOKER

Happy batday, Birthman.

Batman opens the present since he's a good guy. It contains a coupon for new parents, but is expired. This is a Joker joke.

The Arkhamverse is a damn near PERFECT Batman universe, this is peak Batman, if you know nothing about Batman and you want to learn, this series will give you so much to look into the characters and the lore in general, for example, Batman has easily got the best rogues gallery out of any character, and throughout the series, especially Asylum, the tape recordings and character bios are great to look through and will give a great insight to who the villians are, what their motives are, general info and stuff like that. Also, the characterization and writing of all the villians is top-notch, especially Joker, well Jason in Knight was a bit iffy but hey, nothings perfect. These games' atmosphere are just something else, the vibe and feeling you get when running around in the asylum and flying around in the cities in the other games is unmatched, not to mention their incredible soundtracks (City's main theme is amazing and the Asylum menu is such a vibe). Now, just because Asylum is my favourite, doesn't mean i think its the best game, for me that would go to City, but Asylum will always be my favourite because of how much it means to me, not only is it the game that got me into batman, but it was one of the first games i even remember playing alongside Lego batman. This game is always a gem to replay, the beginning of the game always puts the biggest smile on my face, i've pretty much memorized the entire opening sequence, line by line. This game was a massive part of my childhood and is one of the most nostalgic and exciting memories i can possibly think of. This game was the perfect way to start off the series, and honestly it was way ahead of its time, and still holds up very well today, its an absolute masterpiece, the whole series is, and yes, even Origins.



Thank you Kevin Conroy, for everything, you will always be the definitive voice of Batman, the best Batman, nobody did it better than you, thank you for giving me such an awesome childhood. R.I.P.

Beat it at around 15 hours (didn't achievement hunt, not worth it imo) the Asylum is a tad small, bosses aren't as good as they were in Origin but the end Joker fight is pretty big and will play a part in the next few games, solid Arkham experience, worth a try and holds up pretty well for a 2010 game

1 Arkham Origin
2 Arkham Asylum
3 Arkham City

Still holds up even if the gameplay is slightly outdated (compared to the newer titles in the series as you have less moves and gadgets but you have to really learn how to use the ones you have).

The in-game atmosphere is not exactly open world but you can travel across the whole asylum/island. It is creepy and perfect and gives a horror movie/ game vibes.

Would recommend purchasing this as part of the Arkham Trilogy as you can play and get the whole experience as well.

While I know Arkham Asylum is not the best in the series, this is such an incredible start and strong foundation for the ultimate Batman game. I'm sure when this first came out people were asking themselves how it could even get better from here (it did). 
For an older game, I was pleasantly surprised how well this holds up. Like, extremely well might I add. The story is incredible, fighting and encountering all of Batman's roster of villains is such a blast, and using Batman's gadgets, glide, and combat is insanely satisfying. 

If you want to play a Batman game, or get into the Arkham series as a whole, this is such an incredible way to start your journey. As a Batman fan, I'm so happy this exists and the fact that the games only improved is the cherry on top.",1598235023,1688252710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Batman: Arkham Asylum is the first entry in the Arkham franchise. Although it is now over 13 years old, the game still manages to shine through its age for multiple reasons. I'll be going over everything that I personally enjoyed and disliked about the game and why I recommend it, and why you should (or shouldn't) buy it.

[b] Pros [/b]
[list]
[*] The story is amazing, arguably the best one out of the entire franchise. The characters (and mostly the villains) really stick to their roots, the pacing is great, the voice actors are out of this world (the Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as Joker is unbeatable) and the lore behind the asylum is fantastic. I am always in love with the setting and the progression of this game whenever I replay it.
[*] The length is also perfect for a campaign game in my opinion. You can finish the story in about 7-8 hours and 100% the game with around 20 hours, which is just perfect for a casual singleplayer experience.
[*] The game is also extremely stable. Very good performances, can be played on roughly anything, very few minor bugs.
[*] The level design is also admirable. The map is fun to navigate, while staying rather short, yet all the locations are truly unique and different from eachothers. It's the only game in the entire serie that I enjoyed everything about the map and the areas in general. [/list]

[b] Neutrals [/b]
[list]
[*] The gameplay was decent, although somewhat repetitive. No need to hide it; the Batman games are mostly button mashers. Sure, you can do sick combos and prepare beforehand your fight, but you can also achieve the exact same thing by spamming your buttons. It can get tiresome at some point. Fortunately, the combat is at least very fluid, and the perk system/the gadgets unlocked throughout the game offer some variety to it.
[*] The graphics hold up pretty well, but they aren't over the top too. Fortunately, you can mod your game to make it look even better.
[*] Same goes for the sound design, except you can't do much about it. The sound quality is pretty rough on some occasions, they're also specific sound effects that feels old. However, since it hasn't triggered me at all during my experience, so I've put it in the [i] Neutrals [/i] category, but I could understand how it would break one's immersion.  [/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
[*] It is a pain of a game to fully complete. The amount of tedious backtracking that needs to be done in order to find a TON of collectibles is just plain boring. Backtracking in video games isn't something I have trouble with in general, but when 3/4 Riddler trophies are locked behind abilities I know I will unlock in a few minutes yet won't allow me to come back to the zone for a while just doesn't cut it for me.
[*] Outside of the base game, the challenges are tedious and just not a lot of fun. They're also extremely hard to complete with 3 stars, so for anyone looking to 100% this game like I did, good luck.
[*] The boss fights are underwhelming. Every time I encounter a boss, I'm reminded why this game was made in 2010. Except for Scarecrow and maybe Poison Ivy, all the bosses act the exact same, even the Joker during the last boss battle. If you're going to give us villains with such strong personalities, make sure to reflect this upon their move sets at least. [/list]

[b] TL;DR [/b]
It's a great semi open-world linear game with good pacing. The setting and the story are both phenomenal, and the characters are perfect. Everything holds up relatively well to today's standards, aside from the bosses who were disappointing for the most part. If you're a completionist like me, chances are you'll suffer trying to 100% this game, since it has so much backtracking and ridiculously hard challenges. Thankfully, it's a very stable and easy to run game, perfect for older systems.

So let's start with what I love about this game: I actually really enjoy the metroidvania world exploration, and the atmosphere of this gothic nightmare of an island of madness is superb, with a very classic Batman story fighting a bunch of classic villains, and voicework from Mark Hamill as the Joker and the late Kevin Conroy as Batman is as wonderful as those two always are as these characters.

So why am I posting an angry review after ragequitting an encounter?

Because this game is dated, and as I'm writing this in 2023, the actual fighting and stealthing gameplay that this title [i]turned into an industry standard[/i] is made more memorable for its flaws and all the ways other games have done it better since. These fistfights with goons [i]aren't fun[/i], but those at least go by pretty quickly. No, it's the stealth sections against goods with guns that are actually fucking miserable, and make up an important core of this game that you will have to do a lot of, die a lot in, and re-do a lot of. They aren't a fun challenge, they are an aggressive waste of your time for even small failures.

This game is charming for its atmosphere, and clearly very much adores Batman and his surrounding cast of characters, and that enthusiasm is infectious and delightful... but only carries it so far. Is it worth playing if you want to recognize its place in video game history? Absolutely, it holds up better than a lot of other games you might play in that pursuit, but just for its own enjoyment in the 2020s? No, the stealth sections absolutely [i]suck[/i] and are not worth putting the time and money into this title.

Edit: I feel like the best summation of my relationship with this game is that found all the collectibles, solved all its mysteries, did all the stuff to [i]explore[/i] and enjoy the map and all that, and then looked at the climactic final level and went ""Nah, I'll pass.""",1687718790,1687920922,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a huge Batman fan, Arkham Asylum made me love Batman even more than I already do. It truly makes you feel like Batman, and it aged perfectly. The combat is still amazing to this day, even if it's sequels improved on it. The story isn't too in-depth, but its a load of fun. Every villain you encounter in this game is unique, and stands out. They're over the top, which is what I love about the majority of Batman's villains. Graphics don't really matter to me as much as it matters to some people, but the graphics in Asylum still hold up to this day.

The blending of 3 core elements of Combat, Stealth and light puzzle challenges is great. The grit of the RockSteady batman universe is pulping and seeps into every part of the Asylum. But i cannot say this game is perfect. Its the first child of the series, the one that mostly came out alright but a few quirks of outdated parenting lead to it not being 'all there'. The game lacks the fast, fluid and excellent movement mechanics of the future games and the bossfights...my god. Enjoy either having your camera locked to a fixed perspective or fighting the same big guy 6 times! 

But again, Asylum really sells what it has, and its flaws arent like gamebreaking or anything. Future games chose to develop combat, stealth much more, and included the excellent traversal systems only with the hindsight this game provided. I enjoy the fact this is a shorter experience, but the expansive of gotham city was missed. Arkham Asylum is what it is, and that is the foundation for Rocksteady's excellent trilogy.

That long walk with doctors checking in, the bio-metric scan, the killer croc cameo and the lift blackout, re-playing those moments was like reliving the nostalgia of my those childhood days.

Historia é nada mais que sensacional, todos personagens são incríveis e bem desenvolvidos, claro dando maior destaque ao Batman e ao Coringa.
O combate é extremamente agradável e funcional 
Indo de ataques e contra ataques (quando aparece os raios em cima do inimigo), esquivas, atordoar com a capa e uso das gadgets ( batarangs, gel explosivo, gancho e outros).
Temos partes especificas para stealth, onde devemos derrotar todos inimigos sem sermos localizados. E são excelentes. 
Temos a ajuda do modo detetive. Ele nos ajuda a localizar inimigos pelo cenário (praticamente um raio x). Ele também nos ajuda a encontrar rastros de sangue ou DNA e ate mesmo investigar certos locais para encontrar evidencias.
Ao passo que progredimos no jogo vamos ganhando XP e level, assim podemos dar upgrades. Eles melhoram nossa vida, adiciona novas gadgets e adiciona golpes finalizadores. São bons, porem poucos.
O mapa e ambientação são excelentes, tendo vários locais claustrofóbicos. O problema mesmo do mapa é que ele é meio confuso em alguns momentos principalmente na ala dos lunáticos. 
Temos também vários easter eggs, desafios e trofeus do charada para coletar.
Tem uma variedade modesta de inimigos, já os chefes não são um grande destaque, bem medianos.
Quanto a bugs apenas poucos erros de textura e leves quedas de FPS ( perdoáveis e não atrapalha a experiencia).
Por fim o jogo é sensacional. Soh não é o melhor jogo do Batman pois existe o Arkham city

**Achievement notes at the end of this review.[/b]

[b]*General[/b]
Well I'll start this off simple. This is a good game. Visually it's highly pleasing and the whole soundtrack is just spot on. You do have to be a fan of the sound of a cloud of bats flying around every time you collect an item, though. Right off the Bat (I'm not sorry) and following an interactive intro sequence putting you in the middle of the asylum, you're introduced to the combat system and Detective Mode (vision) - of which the latter will help you locate anything that lives, moves and can be interacted with.
Then you're basically playing a sort of metroidvania game. Following the path laid out by Jokers schemes, you'll enter a new area where some secrets can be grabbed and others seen that aren't accessible yet until you progress through the story and unlock a new tool.

Touching on the rather low difficulty (at least at Normal and Easy) I'd like to point out that this game does hold your hand. A lot. It's NOT intended for people that love solving clever puzzles and finding out where to go all on their own. Finding secrets is a simple matter of exploring the environments, climbing up onto ledges and into vents and the like. Riddler maps can be found which reveal the rough location of other secrets on your bat-map. Hints are given to scan (let's say photograph) items or scenes that refer to characters from the Batman world and sometimes you might think ""what the hell is this referring to"" until you pan the camera around and see something out of place.
The only thing that comes close to being a puzzle is finding the question marks placed in various locations which are only visible in Detective Mode and require a specific position to scan properly.
Like I said, it's sort of a metroidvania type deal where you need to unlock new tools to find secrets hidden in areas you've previously been through. This is really kind of a formality or an arbitrary barrier if you will as there is no difficulty in using these tools whatsoever, it really is 100% about just having them.
However given that it's Batman with his nifty toys, that's alright. It's still fun to use them and be rewarded with experience points, character bios and trophies.

Speaking of experience points, this is by no means an RPG. But fighting (and fighting well) as well as finding secrets will earn you points that allow you to unlock some gear upgrades and new abilities, from increasing your health, gaining more functionality with your batarang or adding special moves to your combos.
It's worth nothing that these upgrades carry over to the challenge maps, should you choose to try those. Those maps are unlocked by finding secrets so your progress in them and your efficiency will be limited by your story mode progress. If you just want to play the story mode, don't worry about them as they don't give any benefits for it.

When it comes to the dangers you'll face, the game and enemy AI were designed in such a way that with a little patience and careful timing you can easily take out unsuspecting thugs with silent takedowns and surprise attacks. Any hardened criminal worth their salt would be looking around more at opened vents, decorative gargoyles and heck, even just behind them every now and then. But they generally don't. Their vision is limited while you're above them and they'll usually only spot you if you make a move when they're nearby or don't bother to move away fast enough from the gargoyle that you used to string a thug up.
They'll punish you quickly with gunfire until you zip away and I don't recommend trying to get closer unless you're already in stunning/vaulting range and there's no back-up nearby for them.
So in other words, the enemies are dumb. Very dumb. But you can't afford to be completely reckless and just run up to them all the time. Some more on (melee) combat below.

[b]*Combat[/b]
Arkham Asylum features a clever combat system that is well balanced between making it easy to look like the calm and cool Bat-ass that Batman is and presenting a decent challenge in the optional fighting maps. With the freeflow system Batman easily takes on multiple attackers at once, automatically using appropriate attacks with just one button, executing counters with another and allowing for a handful of tools and special moves to be used as you build up a combo counter by continuously staying in motion and interacting with the enemies.
It's not a perfect system and there's plenty things to annoy you, even more so when you're doing the challenges where the combos are extremely important.

Countering doesn't seem to always work very well, leaving Batman open to take a hit because either (it seems) like the button push didn't register or you were already locked into an animation to put a beatdown on another thug. Sometimes countering an attacker (indicated by a clear blue icon popping up) isn't necessary at all as your current attack on another target will take you out of range of say, the garden variety punch or kick. But then sometimes you'll fail to dodge this way because they try to stick to you or use a melee weapon for more range.
Combos are easily broken not just by inexperience (using tools or finishing moves before the combo counter goes yellow, taking damage, punching air) but also the armed thugs. Knife thugs have to be ""cape stunned"" or they'll block your attack. Stun baton thugs will frazzle you unless you get behind them. And ofcourse sometimes the thugs will get their hands on firearms and become a problem unless dealt with quickly.

But with all that said, outside of the challenge maps these things aren't as problematic. In the story mode all you have to do is survive each encounter so you don't have to worry about getting big style points, a higher combo counter or getting out with full health.

[b]*Conclusion[/b]
The handholding also applies to the general storyline. At no point do you have to wonder where to go or what to do as you'll be told by the fully voice acted NPCs and Batman himself. Again though, this is fine. The player is able to fully take in the experience. A brilliant atmosphere, an island filled with known and interesting personalities, sneaking, silent takedowns and all-out cape-and-fists-swinging fighting.
A low difficulty, context-sensitive controls and a well crafted game world makes for a very memorable and super fun action game. Play this if you haven't already.

[b]**Achievements:[/b] The majority of achievements here are tied to your story progress and finding the many secrets. Even the most casual players will have no problem there. One level up in difficulty are some achievements like taking out a titan henchman without using the batarang, this one in particular requires some deliberate combat manouvers and planning. The real problem with (if you care to go for it) getting 100% in this game is the other combat and challenge mode achievements. These infernal (but optional and separate from the story mode) challenge maps offer bat medals to players who can get high scores on them using the freeflow combat system.
Consider what I said about combat earlier in this review and now apply that to a mode where you need to not just not get hit but also incorporate a number of special moves into your combo for more points and sometimes even within a time limit.
Not taking damage and punching all of the enemies out is NOT going to be enough. The so-called ""predator"" challenges aren't a major concern since you can take your time with them and just plan out particular takedowns but the combat ones will keep you busy for some time until you master the combos.

[b]If you're a casual player who just wants some easy fun, don't bother with 100% on this game.[/b]

Game-play is rougher around the edges than its sequels, but that's to be expected. Going back to this one, you really miss how flexible Batman's move-set gets in the later games, but you still feel like you can handle whatever the game throws at you.
Tonally, the game is much more foreboding than the others in the series, although Knight tries to outdo it. Everything about Arkham Asylum as a place feels hostile and haunted, like the island itself is cursed somehow.
The voice acting is good. Conroy seems a little subdued, but I think that was a direction issue, and he's by no means bad. 
Hamill makes the most of the Joker's screen-time, and is entertaining throughout. Sorkin's performance as Harley is also good, and [i]really[/i] makes me wish she'd returned for Arkham City and Knight.

Plot-wise, this game feels the strongest out of the series. City and Knight both had some missteps, and while Asylum does as well, they're not as distracting here.
While I love these games, and City is my favourite, I will say that Asylum has a special appeal to it.
Rocksteady didn't want to rock the boat too much with the story, or do something shocking to shake things up in-universe.
They wanted to capture what a normal night in the life of Batman is like, and I think Asylum does that better than any other game in the series.",1686882670,1686882670,True,14,0,0.648910045623779297,0,True,False,False

And in that extremely impossible case that you somehow missed all the movies (even Nolan’s ones) here’s a quick recap. Bruce Wayne whose parents were tragically murdered is insanely rich, dresses in a suit that resembles a bat and beats the shit out of all kinds of bad guys while using cool gadgets. In a devilishly insane logic of superhero comic villains caught by our hero all end up in a special kind of jail which happens to be also a madhouse. It’s Arkham Asylum. Obviously, it turns out badly; asylum is overrun by criminals, and it’s up to Batman to stop them. That’s it without spoiling too many details. After all the game is set in a separate universe which tends to follow the usual canon, but also steps out of the bounds here and there. And this is a big deal for those, who can distinguish Earth-2 from say Earth-15.

The plot revolving around events of one night and set in one place results in a rather tense game. First in the series Arkham Asylum may lack the extent, size and polish of its successors, but it has that unique feeling of being trapped inside an insane maze. These corridors, buildings, underground and open air sections are so tightly stitched together, that there’s practically no room to make a breathe, unless developers intended to let you. This is non-stop rollercoaster ride accelerating to the limit and beyond it, until you finally fall in the abyss of total madness, lose all sense of time and spend sleepless night with the game. Rocksteady Studios not just break the fourth wall with this game, they destroy it with a power of nuclear explosion. Carefully crafted props, marvelously fluid animations, diverse gameplay varying from famous “flowing” combat to stealth, puzzle solving, detective mode and beyond that. And ultimately the story. I won’t spoil you the exact scenes happening in the middle of the game, but they are simply outstanding in their ability to convey a feeling of lunacy overcoming Batman in this nuthouse.

Gotham Knight’s labyrinth path expectedly twists and bends in way that returns the player to previously visited areas with a new set of toys. That differs in tone and simplicity from most of the hard-core metroidvanias. Rather than just giving tools to overcome some obstacles game gently pushes you in the right way making sure you won’t struggle with trying to figure out what to do next. It’s not a game about exploring, though there are some clever hidden optional areas containing secrets and unobvious puzzles; but that’s for those who just can’t get enough of Arkham Asylum. 

When it comes to the main progression route the game won’t let off your hand. And while in general that would be a major flaw in my eyes, this time it isn’t. One can say that it’s just a matter of perspective, matter of taste; that you can’t just drop off the player in the middle of nowhere nowadays and hope, that’s he’s clever and curious enough to figure his way from the starting point towards the ending. That may be true… it actually is true, I must say, but that’s beside the point. That’s the matter of taste. Back again to perception of it. Here we have that idea of lunatic luna-park, the goal of filling player with madness. And you can’t just stop and let player wander without breaking that feeling and pace. You ever had that weird nightmare where you run in circles seeing same place again and again not being able to comprehend how many times you did it, not being able to break the cycle? Even if you haven’t, I think you can get it. And that pardons Rocksteady Studios.

This was a breakthrough for the video games back in 2009, and it still is a stellar interactive experience whether you care about Batman comics or not. And the actual secret for this success turns out to be rather simple. It doesn’t matter if player is a fan of Bruce Wayne, it matters that developer is.

The predator sections are a lot of fun in the campaign, but less so in the other part of the game (the word is slipping my mind at the moment) where they add in optional challenges that you need for 100% completion.

Being loosely inspired by the Grant Morrison graphic novel ""Arkham Asylum: A Serious House On Serious Earth"" this first outing of the Arkham series while being much more simplistic and smaller in scale compared to it's sequels does not take away from the quality of it's fun fast paced beat em up action and strategic stealth gameplay, open level design which is fun to traverse and full of collectibles and secrets, a dark and grimy aesthetic which holds up to this day and great voice acting delivered by some returning actors from the Batman Animated Series. While it's sequels add on and refine on what's established in this game, I do believe that this game aesthetically beats out the others with it's grimy, dirty, rusted and overall disgusting look of the asylum which is reminiscent of the graphic novel it's based on with a graphical style that blends the comic book designs into a semi-realistic look. If you have played the other Arkham games or not I still HIGHLY recommend playing this modern classic, you will have a lot of fun and may even appreciate and find value in this game's simplicity as opposed to modern superhero games such as Square Enix's Avengers with it's barren environments, weak visuals and repetitive gameplay.

This game is a ton of fun and has aged very well. The combat and gameplay is great, and there are some fun puzzles as well. The only minor downsides with the game is the story could be a little better and since the game came out so long ago, there are some noticeable differences compared to the graphics and smoothness of newer games. The game can be pretty difficult at times and also has an awesome stealth system that is lots of fun to mess around with. This is by far one of the best games I have played recently and I would give it a higher score if I wasn't trying to leave room for other games. There are also plenty of riddler trophy collectibles scattered throughout the game for completionists and some special side gamemodes.

This is the first game of the Batman: Arkham Series, and when it first came out, I was so excited to play because I've always liked Batman. However, I didn't play it at launch for obvious reasons. But when I did, I had a blast with the rudimentary but awesome mechanics, the storytelling, the world building, and the overall masterpiece that it is.

I've heard many people say that this game isn't that great and that people only like it because of nostalgia. Sure, it might be enticing to experience the game for the first time again. However, personally, I find that my deep familiarity and understanding of the game gained from countless playthroughs surpasses the allure of experiencing it anew. Nostalgia aside, it is the accumulated knowledge and appreciation I have developed over time that enhances my ongoing enjoyment.

If you like the dark and gritty versions of DC Comics, and/or if you enjoy video games, and/or appreciate phenomenal performances, then I recommend getting this game if you have the time and money to experience this work of art.

If you do care about everything (Collectibles, Challenges etc.) then you would be looking at around 15 hours. Since this Game is kinda short I recommend buying this Game once it's on Sale. I recommend buying the whole Batman GOTY edition Bundle once it's all on sale since it's going to be so cheap to get all 3 Games.

With its immersive storytelling, stunning visuals, and flawless gameplay, Batman Arkham Asylum proves that a superhero game can achieve AAA quality and captivate players like never before.

At the heart of Batman Arkham Asylum is the revolutionary FreeFlow Combat system. This combat mechanic is a game-changer, allowing players to effortlessly string together intricate and acrobatic combat moves. The fluidity and responsiveness of the controls make players feel like the Dark Knight himself, as they deliver devastating combos and seamlessly transition between attacks, counters, and evasions. The combat is a perfect balance of strategy, timing, and skill, providing an immensely satisfying and empowering experience.

The game's mechanics go beyond combat, as Batman utilizes his detective skills to solve puzzles and unravel the mysteries of Arkham Asylum. The Detective Mode feature allows players to analyze the environment, detect hidden objects, and uncover vital clues. This adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay and showcases Batman's unparalleled intellect and detective prowess.

Batman Arkham Asylum also excels in its storytelling and world-building. The game presents a dark and atmospheric portrayal of the iconic Arkham Asylum, with its haunting architecture and twisted inhabitants. The narrative is gripping, featuring a compelling plotline that keeps players engaged from start to finish. The voice acting, led by the legendary Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker, is exceptional and brings these beloved characters to life in a way that feels authentic and cinematic.

Visually, Batman Arkham Asylum is a masterpiece. The attention to detail in the game's environments, character models, and animations is impeccable. From the rain-soaked rooftops to the dimly lit corridors of Arkham Asylum, every location feels meticulously crafted and oozes with atmosphere. The graphics are stunning, and the art direction perfectly captures the gritty and noir aesthetic of the Batman universe.

As a superhero game, Batman Arkham Asylum sets the bar incredibly high. It demonstrates that a game based on a comic book character can deliver a AAA experience in every aspect. From its innovative combat system and engaging mechanics to its captivating storytelling and top-notch production values, Batman Arkham Asylum is a triumph that showcases the immense potential of superhero games.

In conclusion, Batman Arkham Asylum is a must-play for any fan of the Dark Knight or action-adventure games in general. Its groundbreaking fighting system, immersive gameplay mechanics, and high-quality production make it a standout title in the superhero genre. Rocksteady Studios has created a game that not only pays homage to the iconic Batman but also raises the standard for what a superhero game can achieve.

Full review:
Batman: Arkham Asylum is a stunning and almost perfect example of what a superhero video game should be. With exceptional graphics that look great for a game over a decade old, and a solid storyline, it is certainly unforgettable. The music fits very well with the superb atmosphere and the combat system is still not challenged by any other game series. While Arkham Asylum misses out on its mostly redundant boss fights, there are some that still shine out, such as the Scarecrow fights and the incredibly scary Killer Croc encounter. The levels are very well designed, and give you a chance to use almost all the tools. However, I did think that some were almost entirely useless, and that there could be some other tools, particularly smoke grenades which would make stealth/predator encounters much more interesting. While the average thug in the game isn't unique, they still have some personality to listen to and maybe even laugh at before you knock them out. My biggest gripe with Asylum is that the game dies away after you complete the main campaign, with the only thing to do after that is to get all the Riddler Trophies and Patient Interview Tapes.

With that being said, Arkham Asylum is without a doubt one of the best games I've ever played, and you should definetely get it if you are interested in it. You won't regret it.",1684883224,1684883224,True,1,0,0.494809657335281372,0,True,False,False

This is also a game I would recommend to people that dont care much for batman, as it is THAT good. and I am confident that they will change their view of the dark knight for the better after this game. Its amazing, I cant stress it enough. 

The riddler challanges, although annoying at times are clever and often feel ""fair"" the character models are amazing, to this day. the voice acting and the story is a 9.9/10 (I only have a super small nit-pick, its about Mr. jonathan crane. I wont say more because of spoilers) the combat is fluid and good (most of the time) it just needs a little refining (which later games have done), the graphics still hold up and the open world is immersive 

Truly one of the best DC themed games of all time, and one of the best games.. in general

Combat: 9/10 
Movement: 8.5/10 
Glitches: didnt really find any
Graphics: still hold up

The story is interesting and there's plenty of suprises that awaits you in the game! Maybe the only ""boring"" part is finding all the Riddler's trophy's but if you're an achivement hunter (like me lol) you'll enjoy it!

got less then 5 fps at times although I'm using 3060 12 gb which is a stronger card then the strongest card there was back then.

even the running animation is ridicilous. there is a lot of parkouring that wasn't fun but that might be because of my immersion break.

the game is quite similar in terms of mechanis to dmc which I loathe. so no need to go further.

story doesn't make much sense but they didn't relly take themselves seriously so that is that.

there are some good tempo with epic hiding boss fights etc. one downside to this however is that from the story, cinematics, and what-not it is obvious they started developing with way bigger dreams. and the game had to suffer from it. almost all the bosses you will face are the same boss. rest of the bosses are not really bosses but sequences as in kill this many mob and do this. this is true for even joker.

While it isn’t the most refined game in the series, I of course have no end of respect for this game. And I had a ton of fun revisiting it as a part of my series playthrough. While the combat and stealth are at their most primitive iterations, they are both still fantastic, especially for 2009. When the game starts, you don’t have a lot of options for combat, with only 1 gadget, strikes, counters, and ground takedowns. Getting massive combos is pretty tricky for a while, but as you unlock skills like critical strikes, takedowns, and more, the combat becomes significantly more fun and I like the slightly slower approach to it. There aren’t a ton of gadgets here, however, and using them in combat is not very useful. The stealth is probably the hardest in the series, but it is still really fun, especially once you unlock the inverted takedowns. There is a lot of variety to the mechanics, each encounter introduces something new, like forcing you to be nonlethal or removing the gargoyles (although that one was very irritating). The graphics still look really good even 13 years later, and the music is great too. The environments aren’t that big and I wouldn’t say this is an open world, but I do like the more linear approach here. As for the story, it is really intense from beginning to end. It never drags or slows down, it has a ton of different villains with memorable boss fights and encounters, and there are a ton of amazing moments. The scarecrow sections are a real highlight here and they include some incredible 4th wall-breaking horror. The performances, namely Kevin Conroy as Batman and of course Mark Hamil as the Joker, are both excellent and their dynamic was explored really well. Overall, Arkham Asylum might be a bit outclassed by its successors nowadays, but it is still an excellent start to the series. The story is engaging and very well written, the combat and stealth are highly enjoyable, and the game is absolutely worth playing if you haven’t checked it out.

Considering that was 14 years ago, it feels like it's held up pretty well. I've never really been into super heroes, but this feels very accessible for anyone who knows nothing about it. The acting and animations are excellent, and it really feels like playing Batman. Melee combat is very tight, mostly based on parrying. There's also some really fun gadgets during combat. Mostly linear, but lots of collectables and lore to find if you want to know more about the world and characters. A very memorable experience.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Still looks good in 2023, subjectively
- Joker's voice acting in particular is excellent, but they're all great
- The melee combat system feels good. Sound effects, slow downs and parrying make it feel really impactful
- Stealth gameplay is really good
- Lots of tools for combat and trap setting
- Lots of lore to find if you want to find out more about the world
- A good length, self-contained batman game
- Batman has a kind of x-ray vision that helps both in analysing puzzles and electronics, but also lets you see through walls to track enemies

[b]Cons[/b]
- Batman walks very slowly unless you’re running, or crouched (which is still faster than walking)
- I don’t like combo counters. The combat feels good when you get it right, but breaking your flow is frustrating
- The Scarecrow sections are bad
- About once an hour, Batman would get stuck, or the controls stopped responding (even during a boss fight, which was especially annoying)
- The last fight before Joker with the two titan guys is a complete mess
- Once I beat that encounter (at last), it played a cutscene where Joker spikes himself with titan and his eyes open, then... suddenly I'm in an arena with an already-transformed Joker (it missed a cutscene) and he's just standing there not moving... had to restart from checkpoint again.",1463919601,1683483206,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before I play this game, I don't like Batman because I am not fan of DC. I don't thing he need exist among the non human super hero like Superman xD. But this man make me like Batman :))

The Story is good but not great because it is not real:
- I think Joker can kill Batman if he want in the beginning of game and many scene in this game xD. Or at least he can kill every one in this game except Batman.
- Guards and characters in Batman team are futile xD. This game is about Batman and useless friends. 

Characters:
- Batman and Joker is good.
- Almost villains are good as Scarecrow, Quinn, Ivy, Crocs, ...
- Ivy is so sexy xD. I think they need create Quinn better like in movie :)).

Game play:
- Stealth is fun
- Puzzles that require brain
- Combat is fine. The counter-attack mechanism is not very sensitive, making batman seem a lot weaker.
- Boss combat is very great. I like Scarecrow, Ivy and Joker boss xD.
- Pressing the x button makes me quite uncomfortable when playing the game.
- Many puzzles need to come back to complete later, increasing the length of the game if you want to complete 100%. This is bad and just a waste of time. For example, you need tools to pull down walls, swing ropes to get items and it is not available in the first half of the game.

It was inovative when it came out and continues to surprise so many years later. The free flow style of combat created for this game became a staple of the action genre for a reson. Combat in this game feels perfect, giving you the sense of control and superiority relative to your enemies that plays into the power fantasy of the world's greatest detective. This game also (partly as a product of it's time and world) has one of the best collectathon's in gaming. Due to the linear aspect of the game, there aren't many repeated or meaningless collectibles (all of riddlers trophies feel somewhat fresh as there aren't as many as in later entries of the arkham series). This game is an absolute classic and must play for any gamer that wants to know the history of action games or is just a fan of fun and fast combat and a concise direct story. Now for some spoiler territory:
The pacing of this game is perfectly crafted, you start the game with a sense of overwhelming and crushing madness of comic's most infamous mental institution. The atmosphere and world building is an absolute work of art, creating one of the tensest and nerve wrecking experiences ever created.

Knight felt downright cinematic at times but lacked cohesion, with a plot that fizzles out and tapers before its conclusion. And so Asylum joins all the great debuts of the world - modern Prince of Persia, The Strokes' Is This It, the first Marvel Ant-Man film; great firsts only to be followed up by successors that don't really nail what made them so special.

Pretty janky combat though, which can make combat encounters with multiple enemies very frustrating. Sometimes, Batman will do an animation that you did not ask him to do, and since it is not cancellable, it gives time for others enemies to attack you, which breaks the flow of combat. The best example I can give is at around 3/4 of the story, you encounter a big left 4 dead Tank like enemy along with a bunch of enemies that come in waves. During this encounter, you need to defeat the titan enemy while avoiding or fighting the smaller enemies. One of the tactics of defeating this ""Titan"" enemy is to dodge by double pressing the A button when the enemy charges at you, which will make the enemy hit a wall giving you time to hit it. The problem with this is that since there are so many other smaller enemies around you and that double pressing A with these smaller enemies makes batman dodge over them, instead of dodging left or right to avoid the charging big one, batman will go over one of the small ones and get hit by the titan. This was extremely frustrating to complete since this is ultimately not the fault of the player, but rather a game design issue. Batman sometimes simply does not listen to you. This was the first batman game and I heard that it gets a lot better with the next ones.

I thank this game for creating the Freeflow combat system that most if not all super hero games use now, and for being the first in the greatest Batman game trilogy that is the Arkham Series. 

For those of you looking to pick this up just know this:
1. The story for Batman fans will be fun and engaging but for non fans could just be another Bad guy gets out you go stop him story.
2. The combat in this game can feel very clunky thanks to this being the first version of the freeflow combat system.
3.Bosses on easy and normal can be more of a chore to beat then a real challenge most being just spam quick batarangs, get to a beacon or just straight up mob fights with the boss only being a minor inconvenience. The only exception being killer croc but I'll leave that to you to find why.
But despite all of this the game is definitely worth the purchase and time.",1680902203,1680902203,True,11,0,0.625153481960296631,0,True,False,False

For the record I selected HARD... NOT 'Technically impossible.'
I played HZD on the hardest mode and that's about; 'tough in places.'

Granted, I will give it there could be something in the hardware and time gap between this game and modern systems. So, this is a brand new xbox controller on pc and i've tested it on modern games, i haven't recently become spasticated, it could very well be the software. 
It doesn't even let you do what your pressing either half the time, thats fine, its square enix and I know the style of combat they've used, so you think fine...
but then, its just so much more perverse than that, its not a matter of getting used to a dance or really being in the moment as it just doesnt work out that way.
Stunning bane with the baterang only works as a choreographed moment too, he cannot be facing away or doing literally anything else, only charging.
so after the point he is charging, throwing bricks from the wall and you try to jump about everywhere as some dudes jump in to help too, your basically done.
I went online had a look about but theres zero help because everyone says the same thing which just isnt really so.
Theres actually not many points he takes his own people down, you cannot take them out from stunned either as the game point blank refuses to, but then again you wouldn't really have the time anyway.
The same button that will allow you to escape through his legs also will evade away, which is fine, but it can also evade you right upto him from behind and check this, that gives you damage too from thin air.
So considering 3 hits and your out anyway, its not even fun.
A real shame, I quite like the B man, never played these games and now I wont.
Probably fine for the mortal kombat style geek who likes memorising a series of button presses perhaps, if thats key.
Oh also to see if i was going mad, I ran this using the best permutations a human can within reason...
I also let the controller be at different points too... that is really quite telling. you know, where if you are definitely doing the right thing, aka playing the game, and not even injured, sometimes you'll last longer if you walk out the room and let the bastard hit you, instead of pressing counter or, well anything.
So, I started doing it the same way, keeping all my health, using the tactics that worked... oh, low and behold, if doing the exact same thing and pissing around can have totally wildly different outcomes, and add that to the controls not really being controls?
well then its about much as fun as playing a gambling machine and hoping to win the jackpot.
You might get a little lucky, but most of the time your are wasting it on bull.",1680875380,1680875380,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Developed by Rocksteady Studios and released in 2009, it features a captivating storyline, engaging gameplay, and stunning graphics that make it an unforgettable experience for any fan of the Batman franchise.

The game takes place entirely on the grounds of Arkham Asylum, Gotham City's infamous psychiatric institution. The story begins with the Joker being brought to the asylum, but it quickly becomes apparent that he has orchestrated a complex plan to take over the facility and wreak havoc on Gotham City. As Batman, you must navigate the dark and foreboding halls of Arkham, using your stealth, combat, and detective skills to foil the Joker's plans and save the day.

One of the things that sets Batman: Arkham Asylum apart from other games is the attention to detail in the environments and the characters. The asylum itself is a labyrinthine structure filled with hidden passages, secret rooms, and cleverly placed obstacles that require careful navigation and exploration. The characters are all faithfully rendered in a way that stays true to the source material, with voice acting that is top-notch across the board.

The gameplay is another area where Batman: Arkham Asylum excels. As Batman, you have access to a range of gadgets and abilities, including the iconic batarang, the grappling hook, and the ability to glide from one location to another. The combat is a fluid and satisfying blend of timed strikes, counters, and special moves that make you feel like you're really in control of the Dark Knight himself.

Overall, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a fantastic game that is sure to satisfy any fan of the Batman franchise. With its engaging storyline, stunning graphics, and top-notch gameplay, it's a must-play for anyone who enjoys action-adventure games or just wants to experience the thrill of being Batman.",1680465065,1680465065,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is simple but amazing and alongside the great voice acting from Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill and everyone else, it really elevates the game in every way. The atmosphere is soooooo good, the game captured perfectly the creepy and eerie feeling of Arkham Asylum perfectly. The game play is of course great, the free flow combat still holds up to this day and is responsible for influencing so many games. The graphics still look amazing to this day and the cut scenes make you feel like your watching a movie, there done so well. The boss fights are great and all unique especially, especially the Scarecrow sequences, holy shit they are so good, they come out of nowhere and sometimes I thought my computer was broken, some of my favourite moments in the game. The easter eggs around the games map is great, the voice tapes help build characters and the world and they can be quite creepy sometimes, riddler trophies are fun as well. I cannot express how good it is to have Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill back as there iconic roles, they are the perfect voice actors for Batman and Joker, period.

Not only is it a great story but the lore in the collectables are such a great touch to add more world building for the other games in a way.

Boy was i wrong, this is an incredible game and still holds up even to todays standards, my only issue was booting the game but it seems if you have one drive installed it fixes it perfectly. the story for this game is fantastic, being in the asylum again was nostalgic but also felt so fresh after so many years, the combat was smooth, the stealth sections were and always are the best parts and the villains were great. i would say there are only 1 thing i dont like which is the joker end fight, kinda fell flat but its not too bad the rest really make it up for it, the killer croc liar and scarecrow sections were defiantly my highlights.

(You can uncap this by going into the files and changing the Default Engine.ini and find SmoothedMaxFrame rate) But other than frame rate this game is solid besides for buggy combat, you can feel the combat is not perfected yet much like the other entries.",1679548982,1679548982,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is an extremely well made Batman game, with tight controls that has a beat-em-up style with all the thugs that think they can take on the Caped Crusader! The graphics, for the time, were stunning, and still hold up. My favorite part is getting new gadgets for your tool-belt and unlocking all kinds of secrets!

One thing I found in this game is that it's pretty linear. There is not much exploring, like in future installments to this series. Sometimes, it can feel claustrophobic as you're forced through long series of hallways in the asylum. To me, however, that is how the game is supposed to feel, being in such a place as Arkham Asylum.

Whether you are a Batman connoisseur or just a casual fan of the character, you will find joy in playing this game. I recommend for anyone! 7/10.",1611680299,1679518450,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

While it did age worse than its siblings (mostly in the gameplay), it is still an immensely fun experience full with gothic atmosphere. 

Crazy to think that this game is about to turn 13 years old, it still holds up very well graphics-wise and especially with its story and characters. The voice-acting performance is great by everyone (no suprise here) but not only in the english apartment either. The german voice-acting f.e. is nothing to be ashamed of.

Arkham Asylum: Definitely the most grim and dark of the arkham series, but also the shortest and least polished. 
A great entry with even greater follow-ups. 

To talk about straights positives:  

Everything look-wise (characterdesigns, worlddesign and graphics)
Performance never budged
Soundtrack is great 
Gameplay is fun
Side-activitites are not too bloated (yes riddler has 240 ""riddles"" but they are found easily id say)

Everything more negative:

Gameplay is far more stiff than in the other entries (Id say this is a given as it is the oldest arkham game but I do want to mention it as some may want to start the series with Origins and not Asylum as it is the Chronological start)
The predator challenges are insanely buggy and glitched. It was a pain in the ass to get all maps done for the last 3 achivements.
Riddlers ending seemed a bit shallow, as if it was just tacked on (not much of a complaint but still a bummer after collecting all ""riddles"", again something that would be better handeled in the other titles)

The game feels like Batman Arkham City but a little bit worse. By any means this is not a bad game. It has a great fighting mechanism and nice story.

You are batman who is taking the Joker to the asylym but something feels off. When you get to the asylym the Joker escapes and takes control over the asylym. You have to find joker and capture him.

This game is based in a batman universe that is like the comic book universe with a undertone of the Nolan North trilogy.
The game has the same problems as Arkham City. Most of these are because of the unreal engine.
-You have to do some trouble shooting
-When you talk to somebody it feels like oblivion
-The voice acting on some of the characters is quite bad
-The detective scenes suck and are unoriginal

But overall this game is awesome. When you get it working it's hours of fun.

Pros
+Gameplay
+Story
+Lots of replay value
+The comic book universe
+The best way to be introduced to batman

Cons
-Crashes
-Voice Acting
-Detective Scenes

Considered by many a masterpiece of not only Batman media, but video games in general, this moody, dark and thrilling madhouse ride has lost none of its edge with the years. Sure, the animations aren't the best, and that batsuit looks quite, well, not good, but you can easily fix the textures with something like Asylum Reborn, which is what I used, remastering the games textures while sacrificing none of its original style and atmosphere. Speaking of which, the atmosphere of Arkham Asylum was the standout for me, a grimy, dirty, creepy atmosphere which would feel right at home in a horror game, or a movie about a haumted house, which works so fantastically well because that is precisely what Arkham Asylum is. A haunted house, a madhouse, a victorian freakshow populated by monsters, both literal and figurative, but above them all towers The Batman, stalwart as a rock, as iron of will as fist, making his way through the asylum letting them all know, very clearly, he's not locked in here with them, they're locked in here with him, and the story only compliments the whole mood. Honestly, the Batman Arkham games are possibly my favourite Batman media, they feature such fantastic storytelling, atmosphere, combat and detective work, really making you feel like you're Batman, as stoic and effective when tracking footprints and heat signatures as he is when snapping the bones of dozens of men.

pros:
- the mechanics does make you feel like batman
- Nice map
- Haven't finish the story yet but so far so good
- Harley is in this game
- Good voice acting.
cons:
- I can't use win+ctrl+arrow key to switch desktops which means I can only play when nobody's home
- switching detective mode on or off has this white flash animation which I find too bright. I'd much rather detective mode is just press a button and it briefly show interest in the environment and turn off on it's own.

Be the Batman: What's better than being the Caped Crusader himself? Live out your childhood dreams of donning the black cowl and fighting crime in the dark alleys of Gotham City.

Packed with action: You won't have time to blink before you're caught up in the next epic battle. The game's combat system is as smooth as butter and will have you delivering punches and kicks like a pro.

The villains: The asylum is packed with Batman's most infamous foes, from the Joker to Scarecrow. The boss fights are challenging and will have you on the edge of your seat.

Detective work: Batman is not just about brute force, he's also the world's greatest detective. The game has plenty of puzzles and detective work that will have you scratching your head and feeling like a genius when you solve them.

Dark and moody atmosphere: The game's setting, an eerie and creepy asylum on the outskirts of Gotham, creates the perfect backdrop for Batman's adventures.

Gadgets galore: Batman has an arsenal of gadgets at his disposal, from the Batarang to the Grapnel Gun. Using them creatively to solve puzzles and take down enemies is incredibly satisfying.

The voice acting: The game features an all-star cast of voice actors, including Mark Hamill as the Joker and Kevin Conroy as Batman. They bring their A-game to the roles and make the game a joy to listen to.

The replay value: Even after you finish the main story, there are plenty of challenges and collectibles to keep you coming back for more. Plus, you can always replay the game on a harder difficulty for an even greater challenge.

In short, Batman: Arkham Asylum is the ultimate Batman experience, packed with action, puzzles, and unforgettable villains. So don your cape and cowl, and get ready to save Gotham City!",1677753755,1677753755,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Probably you missed an obscure hint at some point. For example: swish your cape with middle mouse button to astonish knife goons into staggering and double space salto over stun stick goons to give them a whiplash.

In general, if you are stuck, don't think too hard, the solution probably  doesn't make any sense and can be found on the internet.

After armor 1-4 the optional upgrades are quite useless so don't worry too much about the annoying Riddler riddles or any of the other collectibles.

The story is enjoyable, albeit a bit repetitive. The Joker keeps a good face on all his failures and make it seem you are doing exactly what he wants every step of the way. At times it makes me want to do something unexpected, sadly that just isn't part of the script.

First off, let's talk about the combat. It's like being the Dark Knight himself, punching and kicking your way through hordes of goons like they're made of cardboard. It's so satisfying that you'll feel like you've got your own utility belt of weapons, minus the batarangs and grappling hook (unless you count the upgrades, of course).

And let's not forget about the stealth. It's like playing a game of hide-and-seek, only you're the one doing the hiding and the seeking. You'll be lurking in the shadows, taking down unsuspecting thugs one by one like a ninja in a cape. And when you do get caught, it's like playing a game of tag, only instead of tagging people, you're breaking their bones.

But what really sets Arkham Asylum apart is the story. It's like playing through your very own Batman movie, with all the twists and turns you'd expect from the Caped Crusader. You'll be facing off against some of Batman's most iconic villains, from the Joker to Scarecrow to Killer Croc. And the voice acting is top-notch, with Mark Hamill's Joker stealing the show like a master thief.

Overall, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a game that's sure to make you feel like you're the Dark Knight himself. It's like living out your wildest Batman fantasies, minus the billions of dollars and the tragic childhood. So if you're a fan of the Bat, or just a fan of kicking butt in general, do yourself a favor and give Arkham Asylum a try. You won't regret it, I promise.",1677239895,1677239895,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Arkham Asylum is an incredible experience totally worthy of its place in the other two games of the main trilogy.

Mostly because guards won't see when you're flying in front of them but notice you through a pixel-wide crack on the wall when you're on the ground.

 Other than that, combos feel great and the big dude fights are enjoyable, although sometimes dodging in a direction doesn't move you forward but just makes you do a flip on the spot. There's also a bug when you have physX at high, a certain enemy's second encounter is laggy to the point of getting my 1070 down to 5 fps by the end of it.

 The game is lacking a lot of settings in the in-game menu because of it's age but you can fix almost all of those through the config files, check the PCGamingWiki website for Arkham Asylum.",1676988663,1676988663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Never really was too engaged with batman or anything dc produced, loved the dark knight trilogy but never really went into a deep dive or got excited about anything else.
AFTER BEATING THIS GAME I AM WHOLEHEARTEDLY CONVINCED BATMAN IS THE MOST FUN CHARACTER TO PLAY IN A PURELY GAME PLAY FOCUSED VIDEO GAME.
Batman is my dream, he is my main man, a true legend, you can do so much cool stuff with him ranging from stealth to hand to hand beatings and this game does both of those things expertly.
Stealth is cool, i love making traps with the boom boom foam, stringing people up and in general making people run around in freshly soiled trousers.
Combat is fun as hell, honestly at first i kinda hated it and thought it was a pain but by the time id beaten ivy near the end i was feeling like a badass beating the living daylights out of every fool that stood in my way.
The ""platforming"" -and i use that term lightly, cuz its sorta platforming and also sorta just general traversal- is really fun and blends well with the combat, especially love it when you are out on the surface of the island and can just zip to wherever the hell you want to be.
Its actually pretty cool how this game works, as the game progresses you unlock the different parts of the island and get new facilities to explore and kill people in, each of these areas is cluttered with the riddler puzzles, interviews (which were super cool) and all sorts of other stuff. The surface also has the collectables but also in general the openness lets you fight the enemies how you want to, say there's a big group all beating down on one dude, you don't feel like doing hand to hand so you can just find a tight area -like a flimsy metal bridge- place down a ton of explosive putty and then lead them all in, kaboom they are all dead problem solved well done.

I suppose it was fun for the first few hours, but then it just becomes a mess, like there's no direction for the gameplay, they just threw in random things hoping it'd stick. This probably has the laziest stealth and combat I've ever seen in a game, to the point now where I'm going to use cheat engine to bypass the stealth. 
Let's start with the good though.

The graphics are pretty good for 2010 standards I think. Not vibrant but that is the style as far as I'm aware, it's bright though. The setting is really good, a change of pace for me too as I'm not into superheroes.

The story so far (42% completion as of writing), is okay. It feels cheesy at times but can also be really dark. It's a mixed bag and it will have something for everyone. But there isn't much interaction or lore about Batman, and we're reminded again of his fucking iconic 'I'm Batman' moment again. Yes we get it, his parents died, who doesn't know this? I think even my grandparents know this, this didn't need to be in the game.

But the gameplay is something else. It's awful. Everything. Combat is not only boring but unresponsive too. Like really unresponsive. In other games when I can counter something, or it says counter, I can press that and counter, regardless of the current action I'm doing, but in this game, you're locked to your current action and can't cancel it, meaning there's no mistakes. Stealth is similar here. I just got to the part where they blow up the gargoyles, and... ugh... I have to cheat this. It sucks. The stealth in this game is horrible. Especially because there's typically only one or two ways to approach it. This is as unpleasant as Shadow of Mordor's stealth which was buggy by the way. And the exploration is trash. It's so arbitrary. You need to progress through the campaign to reach previously unreachable areas. Which you won't even really visit that often. I haven't even touched the challenge mode and DLC, this is utter trash. Also the scarecrow sequences suck. I'm never a fan of timing based mechanics, and here it's really bad. The upgrades are also pointless. 

Overall I'm not having a great experience. It's really hard to enjoy this game for anything besides the story and graphics. I'm gonna go ahead and say it. Nothing here is GOTY material. Plus there's weird technical issues like this game having a pre-game launcher, and not allowing you to change difficulty mid game, and a weird bug where if you alt+tab enough times in the weird windowed fullscreen you can get by pressing alt + enter a few times, it will completely bug out your window, meaning if you have one monitor, you will have to restart your PC or pray you can navigate a Task Manager window you cannot see.

It's one of those pseudo- open world games that were popular in the late 00's/ early 10's.  You have an open  central hub area that  links to multiple areas that have a more linear layout.

It feels like I'm playing the comic book at every turn! In terms of controls and gameplay... well, I know saying ""This game makes you FEEL like Batman"" is super-cliche at this point, but everyone who's ever said that is completely right.

Bringing back Mark Hamill's Joker & Kevin Conroy's Batman as voice actors was an undeniable stroke of genius! They were great in the Animated Series, and they're great here! Yes, Heath Ledger was the definitive live-action Joker, but Mark Hamill will always be the definitive voice of the Joker to me, and the way Conroy & Hamill play off of each other never gets old!

The graphics aren't unbelievably perfect, but they're great enough that I don't think a remaster will ever truly be necessary. In particular, the effects on Batman's cape were & are FANTASTIC! Rocksteady could have easily screwed up on the cape animations, but they didn't, Batman's cape looks perfect. The surrounding environment still holds up really well, everything looks realistic enough to be sure, but I do have exactly one problem: Detective Mode. Chances are you will very quickly figure out that Detective Mode will help you notice secrets like Riddler Trophies, Tapes & Puzzle Solutions that you would otherwise have walked past without noticing those things were even there in the first place and if you're anything like me you will quickly develop a habit of just leaving Detective Mode on at all times. This is a good thing because it helps you find stuff, but it is also bad graphically because everything will have a blue filter over it that turns all of the bad guys into skeletons, and you'll lost many of the pretty little textures everywhere. Basically, try to remember to turn Detective Mode OFF and enjoy the scenery a little & enjoy the graphics, somewhat dated though they may be.

As for everything else, the story is fantastic, the animations are what they should be everything's awesome and if you're reading this and somehow haven't played Batman: Arkham Asylum yet, what are you waiting for?? Play this as soon as you can! It's a masterpiece! Don't hesitate for another instant! Play it!!",1674968520,1674968520,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was 2009.
The 9 year old me had only just finally convinced my hard-going father to buy me an XBOX 360 as a reward for my then outstanding elementary school performance (Just your typical Asian family stuff). Upon the purchase of the console, as I was inspecting the store shelves, scanning the innumerable glowing cases of green which I was yet to own a sample of, my eyes drifted toward the portrait of a familiar tenebrous character that stood out menacingly among all the other present promotional artworks.
It was the same caped crusader I grew up watching a highly praised animated show of;
the very same ""Dark Knight"" I'd watched a recent Hollywood adaptation of;
It was the ultimate embodiment of [i] vengeance [/i]
It was a veiled creature of the [i] night [/i]
That is correct, it was [i] BATMAN [/i] !

Spare me the cringe.

Regardless, I instantly knew I'd decided upon the game I was gonna pick for my then new console.
A decision which ultimately booked me an exclusive ticket to the sumptuous festival that was to be held at the notorious mad clown's renovated amusement park: the [i] Arkham Asylum [/i] !
And boy if it didn't turn out to be a hell of a roller coaster ride.

Admittedly though, upon my first attempt at the title, I failed to play it to completion. Perhaps the mechanics were a tad too sophisticated for the [i] minor [/i] me and my frail understanding of the English language didn't exactly help with my progression (FYI English is not my primary language, so incidentally, pardon any possible errors that may occur in my composition).
Regardless, I dropped the game and didn't pick it back up until shortly after the release of Arkham City. Having grown at least a few years older, with improved knowledge around the ""foreign language"", I decided to give the first entry another go and consequently, finished it for the first time before jumping to the highly acclaimed sequel.

A few years later, a console-exclusive remaster of the first two classics was announced to be hitting the shelves. Of course, being the avid “Gothamite” that I am, there was no hesitation on my part to purchase, play and ""Platinum"" the game on my PS4.
When I finally converted to the ""PC master race"" and came across a generous discount of the game during the steam holiday sale, I couldn't fight the urge to buy, play and complete the game once again. Which brings me to the next point:

[b] TECHNICAL ASPECTS (WITH COMPARISONS) [/b] :
The PC experience, despite the slightly muddier textures and somewhat lower-resolution cutscenes, easily manages to hold its own against the fully remastered variants.
The [i]con[/i] -sole versions are capped at 30 fps (unless you insert the unpatched physical disc into a 9th gen console), a limitation which imposes a significant hindrance on the overall fluidity of the gameplay.
These remasters are also mostly recognizable for employing a sharper, more vibrant color tone which in my humble opinion takes away from the intended dark, eerie atmosphere of the game and the asylum. The only departments in which the console alternatives maintain an upper hand are clearer textures, 1080p cutscenes (which are still pre-rendered with a noticeably low bitrate) and the addition of precipitation. And admittedly, the rain effect truly does make the outdoor environment of the game look a whole generation apart from the classics.
But with the addition of multiple modification packs available for the game on PC, notably Asylum Reborn, along with 4K upscaled cutscenes that are downloadable separately, the 13 year old PC version of the title is beyond capable at delivering a satisfactory visual performance.

[b] NARRATIVE EXPERIENCE [/b]
This is probably one of the rare instances in which the game doesn't seem to utilize its full potential. The story doesn't exactly offer anything too deep or emotionally engaging and instead presents you with the usual, ever-recurrent, Tom & Jerry-esque trope of ""Batman chasing Joker to stop his sinister scheme"". But the mere atmosphere of the asylum, the detail and attention put into the making of it and the pure thrill and joy that is derived from exploring it, more than make up for the cliché plot that's still relatively fun to follow.
The small yet boisterous selection of the rogue gallery who are admitted to the asylum, each get their own tumultuous time to shine and a renowned few who don’t make the cut are cleverly referenced or alluded to -invoking speculations on future possibilities.
Not to disregard the single ingredient that truly brings out the long-lasting flavor of this palette-numbing haute cuisine: the invaluable inclusion of the holy trinity of all non-live-action Batman media: Arleen Sorkin, Mark Hamill and the late Kevin Conroy, who are respectively known for reprising, and literally defining, the roles of Harley Quinn, Joker and Batman ever since the 1992 animated series. It is inarguable that their performance as the said characters was so iconic and definitive that to this day, the successors resort to imitating their irreplaceable predecessors.

[b] GAMEPLAY AND LEVEL DESIGN [/b]
The gameplay is that part of the game that keeps pulling me back to it. Simply put, it's diverse, versatile, innovative and downright addictive. The combat system and the satisfaction of countering the enemy's attacks while returning them with acrobatic critical blows was absolutely unrivaled at its time and I daresay set the bar for later games that followed. The extensive upgrade system and gadgets that allow for strategic and creative takedowns are also an absolute joy to play around with.
The enemy variety and the assignment of specific fighting methods to particular variants is also a delightful challenge that keeps your head-cogs turning even through the seemingly generic fist-fights.
The Riddler challenges and collectibles are a side-segment of the game that could actually take more time to beat than the main story mode. (That is of course in case like myself, you refrain from looking up guides and walkthroughs online and prefer to rely on your own cognitive abilities instead.) But that eventual relieving moment of satisfaction and confidence-induction when you finally manage to solve a perplexing riddle or find a way to reach the cleverly concealed trophy is truly worth the hassle.
There also exist some supplementary ""secrets"" to be discovered which even further accentuate the spectral ambience that permeates the virulent air of the wacko-infested islet.

[b] CONCLUSION [/b]
Conclusively, despite the simple plot and lower-poly character models, the game has maintained its once-revolutionary brilliance and still manages to cast the same bewitching spell that charmed its players 13 years ago.
Rocksteady’s first Batman simulator is not just your ordinary action superhero video game. It is an immersive experience that allows the player to truly capture the surreal sensation of gliding through a mystifying realm of madness under the cowl of Gotham’s greatest detective.
So whether you are yet to experience the game, or merely wish to reminisce the memories you made playing it, the title is definitely worth your purchase in 2023.",1674846247,1674847821,True,23,0,0.684409916400909424,0,True,False,False

For not knowing what a beat-em-up is before playing this game, I have to say this one is solid. Keep in mind, it's an older title and the first in a series. On occasion there's a clearly missed counter window that wasn't your fault, but how the game is programmed etc. But the feeling of flying from enemy to enemy, only slowing down to watch a takedown animation so you can plan your next three moves? Feels awesome. Playing on mouse and being able to quickly take things in makes this even better. Once you reach a certain level of play the gadgets feel a bit extraneous, as in they may not directly benefit you all the time. You may find yourself cycling through only a couple moves in harder challenges rather than your full gear set. Titans (while infrequent) also break the flow of combat by majority badly, as they ignore standard enemy attack rotation and also only have moves that go through other enemies. Boss battles feel a tad gimmicky in comparison to the regular flow of combat, or say difficult fights in Arkham City (which flow really well with the base combat system).

Stealth sections offer a lot, if not more creativity, than your standard combat section (though there is no bonuses to using your extra gadgets). Hard mode does not make them much more difficult, though that could be due to personal progression rather than game difficulty.

The environments are cool, foreboding even, the music is right on pace with it, and the story and extended lore is of course based in the comics, but provides enough twists and turns to be relatively unpredictable. This game *really* does make you feel like Batman. Small issue which does transfer to the other games, not using the cowl feels like a detriment in exploration sections. Which sucks, because it makes the environment colors go away almost entirely. As I get better and memorize where encounters take place in later playthroughs I feel more confident in leaving it off in some sections, but the amount of information the cowl provides makes it feel necessary to have.

Progression feels nicely tuned, getting a full kit in one playthrough without revisiting sections for Riddler trophies is entirely possible if you earn enough XP in combat sections.

Sum total, this game is an excellent introduction to the Arkham series due to its more limited gadget palette, but entirely good enough as a standalone playthrough as well.",1674681630,1674681630,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had tried out Arkham Knight some years back on a PS4, but found it to be pretty challenging, with the learning curve being a bit steep there. This first game in the series though is an excellent introduction to the combat system that kept getting more refined as later titles in the series were made. 

The game has aged very well, still looks great today. It's a very immersive experience, the camera usually positioned just over Batman's shoulder (though kindly zooming out a bit for the brawler type combat sections). The 'free-flow' combat system, even this early on, has quite a bit of depth to it, making full use of all four face buttons, as well as both shoulder buttons. While this first game is still winnable via button mashing, the player is potentially rewarded with far more experience as well as greater damage output for timing each and every button press more precisely. One button for basic melee punch/kick, one button for countering, one for stunning, and one for evasion... with the shoulder buttons used for a couple of combat friendly gadgets.

The stealth sections were my favorites, requiring a lot more thought and strategy, as opposed to merely quick reflexes and skill. Many of the boss battles were a let-down, sadly, many of them being repeats or reskins of the same enemy. But there are at least a couple highlights as well.

For those that like adventuring and exploring, the Asylum presents the player with one big open 'sandbox' to explore, including many areas to return to once you've got the gadget required to access them. The Riddler's riddles and trophies serve as the main 'collectibles' here, as well as interview tapes between doctors and inmates (by far my favorite thing to collect), giving the player more insight into how some of Batman's most iconic villains think. 

All in all, a really immersive, fun introduction to the Arkham franchise. I look forward to playing the next one (I got all three games in a package deal for $12 CDN... don't pay $80 for the trilogy, wait for a sale).",1673996204,1673996204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story's good enough for what it's supposed to be,  though I honestly can't remember most of it due to playing in between long periods of pauses. The game is starting to look dated, but that's a given since it's been over a decade since it's initial release. 

What I really want to bring to attention is the combat. It's a good balance between being just easy enough for an average person, but also providing a bit more variety and freedom for those who want something more challenging. You [i] can [/i] try to button mash, although it won't always end favorably. Once you actually try to get a hang of the mechanics, mob fights tend to get a little easier. Even if you don't know what you're pressing, you can still pass albeit with a bit of luck. Most of my playtime is with a controller (Xbox Series & Logitech F710), but K&M works just fine.

Stealth play is really enjoyable! Once you get your full arsenal of items and weapons, the number of ways you can take down enemies is great. You'll be able to try most of these in the challenge mode, but also gradually learn as the main story progresses. I can't be bothered to finish the challenges as I've already been on this game for way too long. Maybe someday I'll get back to it but for now I'm satisfied with what I've completed.

""Batman: Arkham"" series is just that good. Each one of those games are similar in term of core mechanics but they have own personal pros and cons making them unique from each other with no way of picking ""the best one"" out of all of them:



===============================================



☆Batman: Arkham Asylum

Pros:

+spooky and chill atmosphere of crazy asylum

+everything Scarecrow related

+not ""too scary"" but ""ok"" amount of collectibles and puzzles (collectibles that give you both experience points, healing, challenge maps and bonus in game content)

+very entertaining ""Joker"" DLC (only available on other platforms than PC but there is way to mod it in on PC) 

+rest of DLC's challenge maps is alright too

+not many of them but bosses and mini-boss fights are good enough for the first game in the series, I have nothing to complain about here



Cons:

-the smallest and least dense map out of all Arkham games in term of side content

-the weakest combat out of all Arkham games because of slowest animations ever, least amount of combat gadgets and least amount of ways to take down people

-predator sections feels a bit too slow with not enough ways to take down goons after playing other Arkham games 

-zero side activities beside collectibles which are not even that cleverly hidden

-no fun Riddler puzzles that require gadgets to solve

-very small amount of unique challenge maps



===============================================



☆Batman: Arkham City

Pros:

+bigger and more dense map than in Arkham Asylum

+improved roaming, gliding and exploration

+more NPC's to interact with

+way, way better and way more boss fights and mini-boss fights 

+extra fun side missions

+way more good and unique challenge maps and unlockable bonus content

+4 unique playable characters and lots of extra skins

+Catwoman mini story DLC was ok



Cons:

-story and motivations of few characters in this game are the least coherent out of all Arkham games

-side missions ""Acts of Violence"", ""Cold Call Killer"", ""Identity Theft"", ""Shot in the Dark"", ""Watcher in the Wings"" are often hard to progress on your own without a guide because the game expects you to just randomly find very specific locations and characters while traveling across the map

-Harley Quinn's Revenge was garbage DLC with no interesting mechanics, ideas, boss fights, story or gimmicks



===============================================



☆Batman: Arkham Origins

Pros:

+not only bigger and better map but also snowy

+both story and overall dialogue is the most entertaining and engaging out of all Arkham games

+new Remote Claw gadget (that replaces Line Launcher) is very fun to use and allows you to do for way more stuff than crappy Line Launcher. Not only more utility in both combat and predator but also in exploration. Screw Line Launcher - Remote Claw all day all night, BABY!

+Electric gloves aka Batman's Devil Trigger are way too fun in use

+even more unique and better boss and mini-boss fights. Hands down the best out of all Arkham games

+fast travel

+better ranking system encouraging you to fight better for more bonus experience points

+enhanced detective mode and lots of special missions using it

+you are not fighting only prisoners for a change but also corrupted cops

+even more unique side missions

+not as many challenge maps as in Arkham City but still a lot

+3 unique playable characters on challenge maps

+multiplayer mode (its kinda dead at this point but overall quality and gameplay of this mode was very good and fun)

+both ""Cold, Cold Heart"" and ""Initiation"" DLC's are very, very good



Cons:

-definitely the most glitchy out of all Arkham games, yet nothing game breaking like crashes or anything that would cause Game Over or corrupted saves or progression block

-few examples of bugs: sometimes you will just miss, get hit or lose combo for no reason or due hitboxes nearby walls, sometimes the room or texture may no load correctly (restart fixes that), there that one floor in open world that loads way too long so you can clip thru it and fall down into water but you never need to go there, that goofy ""the dark room"" in ""Cold, Cold Heart""...

-very weird facial animations during character conversations during in game cutscenes, mostly noticeable while talking to Alfred



===============================================



☆Batman: Arkham Knight 

Pros:

+not only bigger and better map but also rainy

+Batmobile gameplay (driving around, puzzles, combat, pursuit, racing sections) is just WAY too fun

+Batmobile may be the most smooth and responsive controlled ground vehicle I had ever used over the past 30 years of my gaming life

+finally Batman can chill out inside a police station

+graphically the best out of all Arkham games with even more animations and extra details

+Arkham Knight was a really flesh out and entertaining character, despite (sadly) not being on screen very often 

+character that appears during [spoiler]hallucinations[/spoiler] later in the game is definitely the most hilarious part of this game (no, I am not talking about [spoiler] Batman or Arkham Knight [/spoiler])

+each previous Arkham game had a very good end game sequence but Arkham Knight end game sequence is just amazing

+huge number of collectibles and stuff to do 

+lots of side quests and side activities, good DLC's

+8 playable characters in challenge maps

+overall the biggest amount of in-game content out of all Arkham games



Cons:

-a proper final boss fight is replaced by a set piece for some reason. Its a good set piece but I would rather have another Joker Titan boss instead.

-detective aspect of Batman Arkham games is basically and completely gone here

-repeating some races and other challenges is really annoying just because you have to spend few extra minutes to go back to previous point. Was that hard to implement quick restart prompt?

-the game is constantly hammering you hints for the simplest in-game puzzles every few seconds like the the target audience of this M rated game and long Arkham franchise fans was 8 year olds BUT funny enough the game doesn't tell you where to find Freeze Blast gadget at all so its easy to miss

-some people may find this game way too big or overwhelming due amount of content, collectibles or batmobile sections (even tho I had no issue with it and Arkham City had had way more filler collectibles so its funny people complain about it in Arkham Knight)

-after fantastic amount of enemies and bosses in Origins.....this game decided for 10 steps back and just not bother with that at freaking all. 
Knight have weaker boss and mini-boss fights than previous City and Origins. 
Don't get me wrong: bosses in Arkham Knight are still good, fun and unique on their own but the game could do a way better job at their variety and number, especially after so many of amazing boss fights of Arkham City and Arkham Origins.
Heck, Batman: Arkham Knight had so many moments when you think you are gonna fight a boss, especially at the end of each side quest, and then...........nothing. 
Big nothing. A cutscene where you punch a villain and its over. Garbage!
On top of that the game screams for at least two more melee combat fights against Arkham Knight in the middle of story just so it can build up the character a bit more. 

-you better have a STRONG PC to run this game at 60 fps and max settings

But my god is the combat very stiff and I mean stiff -- I mean outdated; while it was 'okay' for it's time. This game really wants to drive home just how important the combo/counter system is and while it does help you; if you are in the middle of a take down chances are the counter will register or will not most of the time leaving you frustrated or how the room can quickly fill up with enemies, armed enemies, tanking enemies soo quickly you barely have any time to take down literally anyone unless you take them down via the ol' one two punch aka it takes about 30 hits on normal (No seriously that's how outdated it is). Thankfully it's sequels corrected this mistake; I mean I get it- it's Batman. But this isn't a playable movie for fuck sake -- one two maybe a flashy combo move and done. None of this got to beat them to 'death' lolol.

The audio work, visuals, and just exploring the iconic Arkham Asylum is still a treat to be had! That goes double for the riddle trophies and hey! There's actually a challenge mode where it lets you be either as Batman or the Joker and you fight wave of goons or Arkham Security forces. OOOR do these challenging silent takedown ones and as each time you progress through these challenges they become harder and harder forcing you to really strategize and adapt to your tools, tech and surroundings. 

Whether it be on sale or current full price of $19.99 if you can stomach the stiff combat, and the aggressiveness usage of combo/counter system then it's a pretty good experience.",1673318726,1673318726,True,1,0,0.50373530387878418,0,True,False,False

Like bro I just want to keep my score multiplier.

Core combat is fun and simple, but there are a very few ""wtf"" moments like ground takedowns not working, some attacks animations being really slow, and hitting two henchmen at once (pretty sure that was intentional but its slightly annoying). But besides those hiccups I loved it. It's just a shame the game doesn't get crazy and throw diverse enemies all at once. Imagine if they put you in a room with lunatics, knife-guys, some standard henchmen, and a titan that appears at the end? That'd be wicked. The game definitely does experiment with its mechanics, i just wish they couldve done something more spicy.

Challenge maps are really really easy. 3 stars are given out to you like candy and you have a whole 4 rounds to do so in the combat ones. I feel like the predator challenge maps shine the most because it provides players with challenges that spark new ideas of interesting and fun gadget use. I didn't even know I could use the line launcher to kick a henchman off the railways and knock him out, that stuff is insanely fun to learn and do.

The atmosphere is hands down one of the best I've seen in gaming history. Whilst keeping the setting of an Asylum, Rocksteady managed to diversify the scenery. The gardens, the hospital, the mansion, all of these locations just ooze personality and is such a visual treat that still holds up to this day. 

I've loved the Arkham quadrilogy, and this game is definitely my 2nd favorite. Mostly for its setting and comic book artstyle.

i Replayed this game to fully 100% the game, and even then this game is very fun to play. (Though it's hard difficulty is quite a challenge. The game introduce us with the 'Freeflow Mechanic' that most other game nowdays use in their action (Spiderman, Mad Max, Sleeping Dog, Etc). The story's solid and the fact they made epic trilogy of the game is the proof of it.

I will say, the controls are kind of strange, as the counter-attack and the aim gadget are both right mouse, and in the middle of hand-to-hand combat, you'll pull out your currently equipped gadget and your combo will be broken, so beware of that. Besides that, no crashes on Windows 10 or anything. Definitely use a gamepad.

Players take on the role of Batman as he attempts to stop his nemesis, the Joker, from taking over the asylum and wreaking havoc on Gotham City. 

The game features a variety of puzzles, combat, and exploration elements that make it an enjoyable experience for fans of the Batman franchise (new and old). 

The graphics compliment the environments nicely, making them appear detailed and full of life! However, much like relationships, looks aren't everything! So, I'm happy to report that the free flow combat system is equally amazing! Boasting a wide range of skills and gadgets for the caped crusader to utilize on his journey to dispense justice, the combat in the game hardly ever stagnates! You can string together crazy combos, each differing from the last (if you so choose), while taking down endless hoards of enemies. But, if you prefer a more stealthy approach, the game has also got you covered with tactical scenarios that will force you to think on the fly. 

The puzzles are challenging but not overly difficult, making them somewhat enjoyable for all levels of players; And the inclusion of lore/storytelling helps to make the hunt for the game's collectibles worth while.

Overall, Batman: Arkham Asylum is an excellent game that fans of the franchise will love. It has great graphics, thrilling gameplay, and an engaging story that will keep you coming back for more! If you're looking for a great action-adventure game with plenty of puzzles and combat elements, then this is definitely one to check out!

Swinging around hiding in the shadows and picking the goons off one by one and seeing their panic meter go up is great fun.
I won't dissect the combat system since that's probably the most famous part of this series and everyone knows about it. I'll just say feels good and Batman feels like Batman. The boss battles are good but can get a bit repetitive since many elements are reused throughout the game.
The style of the game is what I'd describe as gritty comic-book style. Overall the art direction with its dark, gothic atmosphere is fantastic. The locations are as diverse as you could make them without it feeling out of place.
Most of the characters are great looking although this is probably my biggest gripe with the game on a couple of levels. Firstly the variety of the goons is too small. They all look almost the same. Secondly, I just didn't like the over-the-top muscles. In my taste, it's fine to have some comic-book-style muscles here and there, but in this game every inmate in this insane asylum is about as ripped as Schwarzenegger in his prime. It gets a bit ridiculous and takes away some of the grittiness of the presentation. The supervillains were all fantastic.
The script is well written for the medium and over-the-top in a charming way. The voice acting is phenomenal. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are on top of their game. Both bring the game a fantastic Batman Animated vibe. Hamill will always be the best comic-like interpretation of the Joker for me and Conroy's voice simply IS Batman for me. Arleen Sorkin as always does a great Harley Quinn. Her delivery of ""Bye-bye Batman"" at the death screen is just great. I could go on about the voice actors because every one of them is amazing. Tom Kane and Wally Wingert are also great, alright I'll knock it off.
Finally, this is a game that actually got collecting stuff fun. There are a couple of reasons for this. Many of the collectibles give you backstories to the asylum and its inmates, some familiar that you don't meet. It's great fun seeing how the different villain's cells look. It also makes the game a bit of a metriodvania in that you need to backtrack to get many of the collectibles. But since the map isn't too big and the puzzles aren't too convoluted it makes backtracking to collect stuff feels like you're mastering the game instead of tedious busy work like many other games. There are few games that I spend the time collecting everything but this is one of them.

Overall great game. I recommend it.",1672999957,1672999957,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I gift my son this game for his birthday, then he installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

I finished this in April (5th?) 2022

Still good. It's a lot slower and much goofier than I remember compared to when I was ten, and most jarringly it’s a lot more shallow (in regards to character arcs, gadget design, boss fights etc., nothing that hasn’t been said a million times before, all of which is alleviated in its sequels), but the atmosphere and vibes are still dope owing a lot to the soundtrack and art design. It also still looks SO good graphically it's almost absurd. For a first attempt as revolutionary as this was I’d say it has aged quite well. 

I also got 100% in this which means collecting all Riddler trophies and completing all combat/stealth challenges, which was pretty chill to do while just listening to a podcast, although the Riddler challenges are pretty monotonous and thrown about with little thought, and the combat and stealth challenges are fun despite bringing to light some of the limitations of both systems in this first iteration of them.",1382700106,1672739761,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

You don't need to have played any other game before,
This game doesn't require you to have played any other Arkham game to understand the story, all you need is a slight understanding of the characters but even then there is a character information tab for each character in the game.

Although its an old game, its still really good.
Its age does not effect how good this game is, although the cutscenes are a bit old looking the game overall is still really good for its age.

The stealth and fighting in game is interesting.
Usually i don't like stealth in games however in this game it is rather enjoyable. At times it can be frustrating but after you get use to how the stealth works it is fun. The fighting in the game is mainly close range combat but there is a really cool countering and dodging techniques.

Overall the game is really good and i personally would give it 8/10. Its atmosphere is amazing which really pushes up its points for me. I have not yet played any other Batman Arkham game yet but once i do i might compare the games.

STORY: It is like a comic book that is alive. It is fun, interesting and really makes you feel like you are Batman. Its not the strongest in the series but oh man, I just love it. Villains are great, there is a very very cool game twist that you will love ( and be very confused at first!) Voice acting is on point, dialogue is so funny at times. Plus the atmosphere is so gothic, you get very drawn into the world.

GAMEPLAY: A bit rough, fighting big gangs of thugs and those Titan bosses was a mess sometimes. I died so many times because I would get cornered and then get ran over by a Titan boss. Not many options for combos and gadgets are not used much in combat (this gets improved on in the next few games). I did have an issue trying to download the game, I had to download some kind of installer to make it run on my PC. If you have this issue, I suggest Youtube, that helped me.

GRAPHICS: Textures look good. Character design, hmmmmmmmm. Why is everyone so ugly. The face modeling was definitely the weakest in this game. 

VERDICT: This is an older game but it is soooo good. I just love it and I think you will enjoy it too. :) Ignore the ugly characters and have fun playing it, it is very creative with its story and gameplay.
