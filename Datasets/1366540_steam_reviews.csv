I think it is inspired. 

I have a couple of complaints,  So far I find the middle view button annoying.  and the mouse pointer moves when you go up a level on the path of your conveyor belts, it could be a little more initiative with the levels and points of connection it was fine until I saw you could stack. 

Maybe I've not found out how to control it yet but its so fun to notice little detail,  like, you're on a planet and you see the constellations move around you as a map surround.  Thats' really cool. 

Discovery is as much fun as just playing and figuring it out so looking forward to the developments and hope the controls are better developed too

Have non-stopped played this game every time I get home from work until I go to bed. It is so addictive! I love watching my dyson swarm slowly grow, and getting excited when I find the next new thing to start making, or the next ore that makes my life 400 times easier. I'd highly recommend turning the resource amount up or to infinite (You are disassembling planets after all). I really enjoy how big the environment is, there are a lot of solar systems and planets to exploit. Many resources and fun to be had! I love the alternative recipes, wish there were more for some of the weirder crystals n stuff but hey! This game has a really nice vibe and I hope the devs keep it up :)

Would love to see an update where there's a deep-core drill, and it slowly takes resources from the planet itself. Irl, we'd disassemble mercury in its entirety to build a dyson swarm for ourselves. :)

Conveyors automatically snap to conveyors below them with no discernible way to turn this off (even if the conveyor belt doesn't have a connection possible there). I would prefer if conveyor belts only snapped to conveyors on their level, or conveyors with an open connection (as in an incomplete conveyor)

Only issue I have, I have 3 shells over my home star (Dyson sphere) and I'm making over-all less power than I would've if I just invested more into solar sails. Made 60 GW with sails, 60ish with the end-game power-generator???????? I think the Dyson Sphere needs a SEVERE buff. In reality it would be making enough to power that system for the rest of that star's life, no matter what you put down. (Its almost finished, goes up in smaller increments than the sails did). You'd think that if you put 60 GW worth of sails into a dyson sphere you'd get 60 GW.

There used to be some issues with things being farther along in the tech tree than they should have been but they seem to be resolved now. 

Definitely a 10/10 for me. 
My only complaint would be that there is no ability to put down blueprints at a distance or to see other planets besides the one you are currently on. But that's more of a nitpick than actual criticism. 

Dark fog update: 

When I saw they were making an opponent to fight on the way to making the Dyson sphere I was exited. The video showed warfare and all of it filled my imagination. When I actually got there it was disappointing. I was expecting a plague but got a mild nuisance after I unlocked the missile launchers. These weapons have a limited range on their own but can cover an entire planet when paired with a station that extends their range and draws the fire of enemies. It also relays power and charges the mech. The invasions themselves are laughable. They spend all their time building up a massive number of units but then send out just a couple tiny units when the threat meter fills. There are also space invasions but I never got to see them even deep into the late game. All of this makes the other weapons obsolete. Why would I make them when I can just automate the production of the relays and build missile ammo. 

There is also the problem of the logistics which wasn't really that bad before the dark fog but with the dark fog I suddenly have an influx of new materials from the destroyed dark fog units which I'll never use because there is no easy way to transport them between planets. The planetary logistics towers only have 5 slots open to transport anything at all and only 4 if you want to bring in new space warpers so they can go between star systems. The dark fog many resources from simple to complex so if I wanted to collect all of them I'd have to set up a dozen towers and find a way to bring them the resources. There are ways of transporting them long distances with drones but each box will only allow one resource to be selected and won't change automatically. The only reasonable option at that rate is to make a track that covers the massive distances. 

Because the game seems to have a vendetta against automation involving drones it just ends up feeling unbalanced and inefficient. Even the act of having a logistics tower drains the power massively while not a problem if you have a Dyson sphere chunk in orbit already it becomes a massive issue if all this is on another planet. 

When you finally have the tech to build space fleets you don't command from the ground, you stick them in a slot on one of your menus and go close enough for them to deploy and wait 20 minutes for them to do enough damage to sort of stop the attacks. Even this is buggy though because if there are planetary bases the core instantly re spawns and even if that is dealt with the craft that floats above planetary bases isn't automatically targeted and have massive health pools. This means they stay floating their and the system is technically not cleared so they continue to be an issue unless you manually target them and destroy them with your own ammo which takes FOREVER to destroy even one of them. 

With all of that being said I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. 
I do recommend that you play factorio instead. You won't have space exploration but there are mods to fix that. ",1677491226,1708451806,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I was introduced to factory games by factorio a couple years ago. I hopped around, figured out that I really liked factory games, and started my search for some new ones. I played satisfactory for a while. As well as a couple other similar games. I stumbled upon DSP by chance, and I have never been happier. It might be because I have a slight fascination with Aero-Space industries, but I think that this is the single best factory game ever made. 

Way beyond worth what they are asking. 

The explorability of the vast universe is a bit repetitive, but it is nothing short of exciting to wander into the unknown. 

When starting out in the game, it is hard to grasp the sheer size of how large your factory can grow. In the beginning it seems almost impossible to cover the entire planet, let alone get to another planet. Boy are you in for a surprise. I have been playing this game for a while, and the stunning graphics and sophistication of the game still blow my mind to this day. 
While the game is advanced, and most likely hard to wrap your head around for new factory builders, it actually may seem easy for people coming from factorio. It is a little bit simpler, with less EXTREME sophistication. 

But at the same time, the slightly easier understandable logistics controls are somewhat of a relief, it doesn't feel like you are coding the drones to do certain things, you simply tell it to demand or supply. There are a couple options to fine tune, but unless you have an entire solar system, most of them are irrelevant until you reach late game. 

As you can see, I enjoy this game. A lot. I whole heartedly believe anyone that is invested in factory games, or looking into getting into them will absolutely love this game. 

EDIT: 100 hours later, nothing has changed. Didn't complete the game on my first few runs, I rather enjoy the earlier stages of the game so I've been restarting. 

EDIT 2: I'm in college now, and this game has become my outlet for a lot. Love these devs and this game man.

If you liked those, you will most likely enjoy this.  Similar gameplay loop, but you get to build a dyson swarm, dyson sphere, and artistic dyson """"""sphere"""""" around stars.  

Note that the endgame is structured differently.  Due to interplanetary logistics being far, far better than any other method of transportation, you end up just building cells that import resources for one item and output that one item.  Interplanetary logistics handles the rest.  Intra-planetary logistics are.... not great.  

Also, you can't have logistics curate your inventory like you can in factorio.  Logistics slots are artificially limited and cap out at 12 or so for no reason.  

Lastly, while the devs make huge efforts to keep the game's processor use low, eventually you're making thousands of items a second and the game starts to slow down.  For me this happened before I was able to get the big production achievements.

It's like watching the inner mechanics of computers at work in a way that Factorio or Satisfactory cannot do.

How?
Engine black magic I suspect. The things you can do with this game logistically is another level for me than those two games. It has that right balance of 2D/3D to really highlight the vertical layering element of logistics. Factorio really doesn't do that and Satisfactory is too 3D leaning to be properly informative to me about these complex mechanics.

To emulate such system mechanics using programming (computer logistics essentially) is one thing. But this runs sooooooooo smoothly that I'm actually going to compare the optimisation to much older simulation games: Transport Tycoon and SimCity 3000. 

Why? 

Their level of optimisation made them run well on toasters. My low end gaming pc could play Dyson so smoothly I was baffled, given the complexity of calculations this thing must do behind the scene. I am truly curious how they did this... in Unity. 
CS and other games don't play nearly this well. It's kinda sad that you could get this level of quality with Unity given how it's recently imploded.

- Even if I don't have enough items (buildings) I want to place, then just produce it and place it automatically afterward.
- When research is done, you get a huge message right into your face, which block you from building. As long as you don't acknowledge this information, you can't do stuff! -> just a beep and a small information on the top, or let a research icon blink.
- Whenever there are more than one window open (inventory+storage or inventory+production window you have to press ESC several times to close them all -> just close them all on ESC.
- I'm not interested in what items are buffered in a building, what is more important is to see how many are produced per minute/second all the time, even when the buffer is full (zero/minute is useless when the belt is full)

Personal logistics does not work at all; combining these two gives the impression of a broken game that will never be fixed and only accumulate more broken systems. Combining the broken logistics with the ball of annoyance that is combat, and one gets a souring and torrid mess.

the research system's faults are now unacceptable. The entire tech tree is built WITHOUT combat in mind. Each step requires one to ""do things wrong, to do things right"" namely by forcing the player into horribly inefficient methods of research in order to unlock substantially more effective ones. This structure works well in a game without combat as it adds a layer of difficulty into the research systems, but the combat system now turns these suboptimal periods into ones of intense vulnerability. Doing things ""safely"" requires a player to take substantially longer to do things than otherwise. Further, the fact that the combat system requires player presence makes planetary travel into a significantly worse timesink 

Combat lacks the ability to create planetary hangars as defense, there is no ability no control fleets remotely, there are no alerts about encroaching enemies onto planets or into systems. No ability to place patrols in systems or create static defenses on the dyson sphere itself. 

Atop the lack of alerts, is a lack of proper threat from the fog makes it feel ""gamey"". The fog doesn't attack logistics, (good for lack of defensive convoys). Nor are they especially smart.

I will admit, I could sit and watch the fog and player ships fight for hours, but having to physically be present takes away from ones ability to enjoy the fog as an enemy. I also like that while I can control where ship spawn locus is, I can not truly control the ships themselves on an individual basis, and I think that fits well into the game's ethos

The keys to making it all work are physically present, but not properly implemented.

How to fix?

Always have enemy units on a map rendered with ghosts. 

Use the Z mode in the map to control squadrons/fleets remotely while still using the spawn/nav point system, without complete unit control. 

Allow for convoy setups, using fleet control buildings placed on the towers to have armed ships following the logistics vessels at the cost of increased power consumption and warper usage. 

Create fog bases in the dark between stars that must either be found through ""their shadows against the stars"" or when they destroy logistics vessels that pass near. 

Have a visible buildup within a given system as the fog build new seeds, have new seeds be guarded in transit by ships built along side them.

-Don't just instantiate new seeds the second a hive has been taken out; its annoying, frustrating and unsatisfying. 

have visible hives feeding much larger hives you can not see (possibly have some number of stars on system creation be blacked out by dark fog bases). 

Allow the creation of military logistics stations made in orbit of stars and launched to other stars (as a reflection of the fog themselves). 

have ruined planets that have been consumed by the fog in systems whose stars are encased by them. 

Add salvage ships to salvage space debris and asteroids. 

if you keep most of the research tree the same, Make a new research system to contain the weapons upgrades that uses dark fog parts and can happen at the same time as normal research. 
Use different materials from different types of fog units for different trees. (turret shards, builder shards, core shards) 

make the bases get more substantial. 

Your setting should also have ruins of previous attempts by COSMO from before the fog which can be used as sources of weapons research.

the above would require a lot of balancing to get right, but as is the fog is entirely too annoying for how fun they obviously can be.

Unless the Logistics are fixed I can't recommend this game at all; the whole dyson sphere concept breaks down without the ability to send accumulators between systems, and that is completely busted. Add on to that newer logistical systems that just don't work at all, and the myriad of incredibly awkward UI decisions for combat and it forms into a total mess.",1707491783,1707491882,False,7,1,0.534446060657501221,1,True,False,True

If factorio is good speed mixed with some adderal, then I think this game can be best described as grade AAA+ exceptional quality, pure and uncut cocaine. Like the really really good high end stuff they use on wall street and costs a million for a few pounds but is still worth every penny.
If you feel you have too much free time on your hands that you want to fill, or feel like you're sleeping too much and want to sleep a lot less, or have a happy social/active life that you want to nuke into oblivion this is totally the game for it.

So like factorio, satisfactory, shapes.io, or mindustry this is a game where you control a character and have to start from scratch to build a massive factory. This game doesn't have any form of enemies or combat (yet), and honestly I don't think it needs any to be an engaging experience.
Where this game differes from its peers is the scale of things. You get a whole planet to exploit for resources to start with, and after some research, you can start exploiting the rest of the solar system. If that wasn't enough to meet the resource requirements of your ever expanding factory, you can eventually research warp tech and star exploiting planets in nearby starsystems.
It's never not going to be statisfying to see fleets of cargo vessels travelling between planets and delivering massive amounts of imports. And finally, you can not just exploit planets but even the stars themselves (the title kind of gave that away). You start by launching a dyson swarm (thousands of little solar sails) that collects and beams power to your planet to feed your ever growing need for energy. Eventually you can start construction on the dyson sphere itself. It is a truly massive undertaking and will required a lot of time and energy to supply the gargantuan amount of materials to speed up contruction to a decent pace. Depending on your preferred playstyle you may see this as a positive or a negative.  
I personally enjoy looking for bottlenecks and finding solutions to increase efficiency/production/throughput, and this game has that ""Hmmm I seem to be low on advanced processors, ah we are not producing enough regular processors, ah, we don't have enough silicon production, then I'll need new smelters. Ow smelter production could be a lot more efficient if I upgrade the feeder belts, lemme do that first, etc"" -feel that makes you go for hours and lose track of time. 

Another thing in the game's favour: It's damn gorgeous. The systems planets and stars are beautifully rendered. The buildings, while being rather low poly have a clear sci-fi aethetic that does not look out of place and are thematically consistent. The lighting in this game is top notch and anything to do with dyson spheres or swarms is just shiny (both literally and figuratively).

Stability wise I was pleasantly surprised in that in my 40ish hours (the steam playtime thing is wrong for some reason) I haven't encountered any bug or crash. 

Though being in early access the game is not without its issues.  While most of the text info on research is legible enough, some of it feels like a poor google translation and will have you scatching your head as to what it actually does. Trial and error are your friend.

The logistics system in this game is less in depth than say factorio, so a lot of time will be spent going between containers to pick up items you need for expansion (belts, sorters, miners, etc). This game could  substantially benefit from a logistics network where your character can request certain items to be delivered if he's within a certain range, say on the same planet. This would cut down on the hopping from container to container-time that makes up the least enjoyable part of this game.

An upgrade button would also be very very welcome. Currently if you want to upgrade belts/sorters/factories you have to first delete the existing stuff and then redo the upgrade stuff by hand. A simple ""click to plan upgrade"" button would be very welcome in this regard.

I also dislike the contruction bots mechanic. When you want to build something you place stuff as you would do in any other game, and then a drone lifts off from your mech, flies over, builds it and returns to pick up the next item. This is tediously slow, even with drone upgrades. It also only works if your standing relatively nearby the construction site. You are also limited in build range, for not real reason I could phantom. I personally would prefer either doing away with the drone mechanic entirely, or maybe having construction worker hubs that you can place and who go about building stuff even if you're not nearby yourself.

Also produce are cubes with a symbol on it. The symbol is often waaaaay too tiny to be clearly readable from the regular distance, and the cubes are all samey. I think having proper objects to differentiate the different product you make would make the game much more readable.

For the current price I can highly recommend the current build. While not as polished as it could be (because still a WIP), it's a lot more polished than I had expected it to be by this point. I'm happy with the amount of content already on the game and feel like it's a great value proposition.

Dark fog update edit:
The dark fog update is not great so far. It's unfinished and you can very much feel that. There's a lot of tools missing to deal with the space side of the fog. The only way to deal the the space component is to fly out to them and fight them yourself. Which feels like a big mistake in a game all about automation...
I think they either should have adjusted the way the Dark fog worked until they finished the full combat update. Or just put out the whole combat update at once.",1611916169,1707231734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Dyson Sphere Program is a factory management simulator, similar in structure to Factorio, but with a little twist. Instead of one world to build your factory on, you now have dozens. Your goal is to automate the 6 science matrices by traveling to other planets and star systems, ravaging their resources, and solving the logistical problem of ""How do I get this stuff from here to there?""

The first 1/3 of the game takes place in your starting system, and primarily the starting planet where the first 3 matrices will likely be produced. The other planets have resources beyond your starting planet, but the first big challenge is organizing the resources to set up interplanetary logistics to produce the fourth matrix.

Once all that is set up, the real challenge begins. Interstellar travel and logistics will be required to begin expansion needed for the last 2 matrices, and the only way to supply enough power for all those machines is to begin work on a Dyson Swarm and Dyson Sphere. The Swarm is easy enough, able to be produced with trivial resources by this point; and its power output is more than enough for medium-scale automation for an entire system. The penultimate challenge is the Dyson Sphere.

Once your first Dyson Sphere is around 50% complete, its power output will dwarf the solar sails you set up earlier. You can finally begin proper large-scale production for the final matrix.

Dyson Sphere Program's main gameplay loop is very familiar to those who have taken on Factorio, and the new challenges presented by an interstellar network of factories is frankly a massive breath of fresh air.

Nearly every element of this game is just as satisfying and rewarding as its Factorio analog. If this is your first automation game (maybe Factorio's graphics weren't pretty enough for you), It is easy to understand, and has a faster early-game anyway. If this is your second automation game after Factorio, the just-mentioned fast early-game will have you more hooked than the first time you booted up Factorio.

The graphics are very pleasing, the gameplay is just as stellar (pun intended) as Factorio, and the new challenges to conquer are not only a good excuse to explore the stars, but also just plain fun to take on. It just wasn't the first.

Designing this, they made everything nice, and the way it should work.
3d, nice graphic, this constant feeling of the planet under your feet with all it's roundness, and those stars beneath you, which you are able to fly from ~15% of research. That's the best part.

One thing is lacking so far, to my opinion, is combat. I can see how it can turn into grand scale tower-defense battles later, but playing 20 hours and being able to defend with the basic turrets, and every raid lasting for few dozen seconds and enemies dying the moment you get to the front line is, well, lacking at least.

I loved Factorio, and Satisfactory was decent, but there is just something different about DSP that sets it apart.  Part of it may be the theme and what a sci-fi game makes possible.  If the game was limited to just one planet I can see where it would stack up with others pretty equally.  However, the options of finding new planets with new resources, biomes, etc. is just amazing.  Like real life Earth, it is very possible to run your original home planet out of resources.  You have to get creative with power management and efficiency.  When all else fails, you can fly to another planet to start building new production infrastructures, mining colonies, and resource stockpiles.  Then you can build logistics ships that can transport resources back and forth between planets.  When your home system isn't enough, you can then warp to other solar systems with all new planets and experiences.  You can even equip your logistics ships with warpers so they can travel between systems.  Literally hundreds or thousands of different planet options out there in the galaxy.  I'm getting closer to 100 hours of gameplay and I feel like there is still a lot more I can do.  

I will warn you though - this game is highly addictive.  It is extremely easy to be so immersed in the game that you lose track of time.  Too many nights I've been playing and look up to see it is past 2am, and I have to be awake again at 6:30am. ;)  Great game overall!  And to think it is still in Early Access... I absolutely look forward to what new content they come up with for this game.  10/10 would recommend!

EDIT:  I just finished my 2nd play through of the game, and I can adamantly confirm that this is my favorite city build / factory automation game of all time.  I've spent 265 hours on the base game including my initial game, and then my latest restart with the addition of ""The Fog"" combat system.  I haven't even looked into mod content for the game because I haven't felt like it was needed.  While the combat system is still in its early forms; I did think it added another layer of complexity to the game. Early on I found it frustrating because it was something I had to constantly defend against.  Later in the game though it was something that kept the game interesting and encouraged me to do something to break up the monotony of the late-game grind.

The devs seem to really be in-tune with the player base and they are constantly working on new content for the game. I definitely look forward to what they come up with next!

Some mix of Factorio / Rift Breaker / No Man's Sky, without the polish or ingenuity of any of them. What I got, however, was magnificent. Dyson Sphere Program is many things, and it does them all shockingly well.

[h2]Factory[/h2]
First and foremost, DSP is a factory/automation game. The game loop will be familiar to followers of the genre: collect raw resources, smelt/refine them into basic components, and continually produce more and more complicated technology based on an ever-growing factory; balancing power demands, addressing bottlenecks in certain materials, and crafting a giant spaghetti mess is the basic cycle.

And within that genre, DSP is a top tier entry, even boasting a significant portion of the quality of life features present in Factorio (what I would call one of the most optimized and streamlined games in existence). There are very few things I wish I could do but can't, in terms of actually building. The game handles 3 dimensions very well; camera controls are intuitive, blueprint mechanics are good (some room for improvement there) (I especially appreciate being able to manipulate blueprint files directly in the File Explorer), and there is a nice mix of snap-to-grid and free placement where appropriate. Being able to raise belts vertically adds a welcome challenge to organization, and is mostly just cool to look at. It took some time to get used to the mechanics of making complicated belt arrangements (you can use a hotkey to change the shape of the belts while placing!), but it was quickly second nature.

[h2]Space[/h2]
But beyond factory/automation, DSP is just a damn good space game. The first time I hit the warp drive to travel to an entirely different solar system, my jaw dropped. The sound design, the visuals, even the weightiness of the mecha while flying, the entire experience is superb. I immediately thought to myself, ""this is already far better space mechanics than Starfield..."" Exiting warp speed is just as satisfying, thudding back to reality just in front of the planet, as the visual dilation of space returns to normal. It's small details like that that sell the reality of the game. Even the bright trail of your interstellar vessels warping through the night sky between systems is just cool. The logistics system in the game is great, and while it could probably use some enhancements to deal with precise configurations, it's in a great place as-is.

[h2]The Sphere[/h2]
The titular goal of the game, building a Dyson Sphere is a rewarding challenge that will take a lot to complete. It's also one of the most mesmerizing sights I've seen in my [i]considerable[/i] time as a gamer. A planet with rows of rail ejectors and node launchers shooting into the distance to a massive growing sphere is just... epic. I have a dozen saved GeForce replays for the times I simply sat in front of my screen, watching the lights zoom by in the sky. The glow of the planets, the blackness of space, the brightness of the stars (and the [spoiler]black holes and neutron stars are super cool[/spoiler]), the sunsets over the planets... I continue to be absolutely stunned by the visuals of this game. What an amazing job by the dev team (who seem like a great team in general).

[h2]Combat[/h2]
A game like Rift Breaker clearly focuses most on combat -- the automation aspect is minimal. A game like Factorio focuses most on... factories. The biters are there to pester you and make you think about safe expansion and perimeters. In DSP, combat is somewhere in the middle, though it's closer to Factorio. There are bases scattered across each planet that will grow over time, and attack you as your energy consumption increases. There's a central space hive that interacts with these bases and attacks your planets as you build a Dyson Sphere in that system. You can wield different classes of ammunition, place a handful of defense towers, and, notably, maintain a growing fleet of ground-only and space-only ships to assist you in battle. It's immensely satisfying to fly out into space to meet an approaching attack force and to have your own armada zoom in beside you to battle alongside you. The Dark Fog update is recent, and I never played before it; it's also been announced that number of improvements are coming here, specifically to space combat. I can't wait to see what they cook up, as I certainly wasn't expecting anywhere near the amount of polish the game currently has.

[h2]Improvements[/h2]

These are all nits/suggestions. Not ONCE in 175 hours did I experience a single bug (outside of a planet taking a second to render in my sphere system when warping in during the late late game), crash, or particularly frustrating moment. Well done.

- damage balance: it can be difficult to judge when your shield is holding strong; when it doesn't, you simply die instantly, as your health pool is completely negligible next to a decent shield
- materials balance: Maybe need extra tiers to particle collider (strange matter)? And fire ice is infinite from gas giants...
- Sphere building: unless it exists and I didn't find it, there is a frustrating lack of convenience tools in the sphere builder page. Don't get me wrong, it's already far more sophisticated than I expected, with tons of options to do things by hand -- which is what I did. I built an entire max radius sphere, placing each node, edge, and sail section by hand, packing the nodes as close as possible. This. Took. A. Very. Long. Time. It would be amazing to be able to copy and paste sections of the sphere, just like you can ctrl-C/V buildings on the ground. I'm sure the team has a huge list of TODOs, and I don't doubt this will happen eventually.
- QoL:
    - an easier way to view the demands of each PLS / ILS on the planet or system would be great. I spend lots of time trying to find the specific ILS that is doing remote demand or supply for a particular material (this could be solved by better organization on my side in some cases, sure)
    - a way to copy the supply/demand settings for a PLS/ILS to another existing one
    - the statistics page for production/consumption of a planet or cluster is difficult to interpret; are the production/consumption values close because the producers are in excess due to low consumption? Or is it because the consumption is bottlenecked on low production? Or is it because they're both working normally at similar rates? A straightforward solution seems to be to include information about a potential maximum production/consumption assuming perfect supply input
    - let us blueprint gas giant collectors, please!
- the announcer says ""turrets"" like ""tourettes"", this is really silly :)
- mech customization sounds cool, but seems like it's in a bit of weird place between functional and aesthetic without clear explanation; I never ended up using it

Honestly, the optimization of the game seems top tier, and the statistics page is great for identifying your own bottlenecks.

Some performance stats:
- hardware: 4090, 13900k, 64gb DDR5 5600MHz, 2TB NVMe SSD
- 185k hash/s, 12.5k white science/min, VU lvl 73, engine speed lvl 21
- about 15 systems fully colonized (dark fog wiped out, most planets used)
- sphere stats: at any given time, 25k sails attaching, 10k in orbit; 12 million sails placed, 520k structure points placed
- 60 UPS
- 15-20 FPS with sphere on, 65 off
- 75 FPS on a typical supply planet (couple hundred assemblers/smelters, 20-30 PLS, ~5 ILS)
- 110 FPS middle of space
- from stats page: 9.5ms total, 4ms production line; saving test: 400mb at 1.09s save, 1.45s load

All in all, this is an excellent game, and [i]very[/i] quickly became my #4 top played on Steam. I had an absolute blast and wholeheartedly recommend the game. I'm stopping now, at least until the next big updates, but I'm sure I'll be back. Maybe then it'll surpass Elden Ring. Maybe.",1706651192,1706651410,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

Overall DSP is a fun Game, just like Factorio its a very cool automation game. This game gives you a bit more of a challenge in terms of logistics and space as each planet has limited resources and space, also you have to move your items around from planet to planet. I really like this concept!

The only real bummer is the wrong display of the Keybinds... If you're using an US-Keyboard layout this will not be an issue, but once you use a different Key-Layout the Game shows you key binds to different keys. For example:

< is , on my Keyboard - Ingame it display < but i need to press ,
> is . on my Keyboard - Ingame it display > but i need to press .
| is < on my keyboard - Ingame it display | but i need to press <

This is confusing at the beginning and seems like a Game-Dev beginner Problem... (This is the first Game I've ever played with such a problem.)
It confuses new players which are not from the US and should be solved by now. Also when you want rebind keys it shows you always the US-Key. So you need to have a picture with an US-Keyboard next to you to see where what stuff is bound too or slowly learn the US-Keymap... I understand if they don't want to auto detect it, but is it so hard to give us a selection ingame for the Keyboard layout we use for manual selection?

Also some keys are not rebind able, why? (For example the E-Key - Open/Close Inventory)

If you like ransacking planets and stars building factory, buy this.
Tech tree is fine unlike many EA game with super bland tech tree.
With graphic in mind there were less frame drop and lags compared to other factory game.
Late game logistic is way way cooler than any other games. They're very pleasing to look at.
There's no building that purely focus on decoration.(Statue/Monument). Anything close to that is your Sphere and Belts.

Only 2 things I dislike,
the Metadata system (use to skip tech tree in next playthrough) it's quite not renewable.
Second, the GRID, yes its spherical grid closer to the planet axis the tighter the grids are so It's kind of force you to have big build inside tropic area.(Or if you love your Italian pasta *spaghetti* You can place it anywhere)

Now this game came down the same path. The developers are calling their audience ""casuals"" if they don't want combat.
As if there was anything casual about the sort of logistics torture people willingly sign up themselves for by playing games like this.

Being called a casual aside, disabling enemies isnt a viable option anyway because they are now a core mechanic the game is balanced around meaning it's imbalanced and poorly designed if we remove an element like that.

The Dark Fog update ruins that for me. I got no problem playing with some type of enemy in the world but I still want to the play the game my way, at my pace.

The fact we can't change the dark fog settings ingame is the worst oversight i could of seen for this update. This is a single player factory builder - and the Developers are locking difficulty for new and old players alike. Without giving any indication to what the player might be dealing with in dozens (or hundreds) or hours into their save.

I just waisted over 15 hours on a new playthrough, for that exact reason. And posts I'm seeing online of other people having the same problem it's pretty common at the moment. Am i gonna bother to return to this game again after this? Probably not - (this is my 3rd return to try out the game as its been developed)

Bad decisions like this lose long lasting supporters, hopefully they fix this oversight - until then (or this review changes) go play Factorio or something better balanced.

It's here!! Combat is finally here! 
I have been waiting these last 3 years for it and what can I say except that it's AMAZING. 
As with previous features, the devs have outdone themselves (again) and built into the game a full combat system where you battle the ominous 'Dark Fog' forces, both on planets and in space. 

Apart from that, the last ~36 months have seen many major improvements and some additions to the game, apart from combat. 
Things like buffing your belts by spraying them with 'power paint'. Extensive blueprint system. A complete new transport system that is accessible earlier and more readily than the transport towers. You can now use small transport drones quite early in the game instead of belts. 
And so much more.

I am fully hooked once more, the only downside I see is that the Dark Fog right now is kind of an automated progress check that scales with you. If you set the 'difficulty' too low, it will never be any real challenge. Would be great if the AI could evolve independantly from the player and come up with nasty surprises now and then. 
But hey, the devs already promised to expand on combat so I'm good!

Seriously guys, if you ever, anywhere, anywhen, played and liked any industry game, this one is a MUST BUY.



**Jan 26, 2021**
If Factorio, Satisfactory and Empyrion had a child, it would be DSP :D

You notice at every point in the game that the devs have extensively played other genre titles and added a LOT of stuff that was missing in the competition (and indeed, some of it still is), particularly if you don't like mods. Compared to the other games, DSP is polished and fluid right from the start.
I have never seen such a clean planetary (and later on, interstellar) supply network. The idea of combining splitter, sorter and prioritizer in one machine itself is nobel price-worthy. And there are so many of these seemingly small quality of life enhancements that sum up to a really smooth game experience - without sacrificing complexity!

Yes, this is Early Access. There is no combat (yet) and if you look hard, then you'll find some features that are missing. For example, there's no way to overwrite conveyors with other tiers so currently you have to delete it, then build anew. The supply network drones will, if forced through low supply, fly even for a single item so that could be improved because it's highly inefficient in terms of power consumption. There are also as of now no templates, so you cannot copy-paste sections of your industrial landscape.
But really, it's DIFFICULT to find clear signs of Early Access. 

I have only just started settling a 2nd planet and it's already so much fun! Get it!

Update Feb 16: I now have over 90h into the game and have stopped. Why? It's an AMAZING adventure but for me, longtime motivation comes mostly from being challenged externally. Building for the fun of it is definitely the biggest part of DSP now. I will wait for combat to arrive, then as sure as hell I'll get hooked again and never, ever be free :D",1611686514,1705223984,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

The game revolves around the construction of a Dyson Sphere, a megastructure that encircles a star to harness its energy. Players start on a single planet and gradually expand their reach to other celestial bodies in order to gather resources and advance their technological capabilities.

One of the standout features of Dyson Sphere Program is its automation mechanics. Players can design intricate production lines and automate resource gathering, refining, and crafting processes. The complexity and scale of automation can be both challenging and satisfying, appealing to fans of factory-building games.

The game's graphics and art style are visually appealing, creating a sense of scale as players build massive structures across planets. The soundtrack complements the futuristic theme and adds to the immersive experience.

While the game has received positive reviews for its innovation and depth, some players have found the learning curve steep due to the intricate automation systems. Additionally, there have been occasional reports of bugs and optimization issues, though the developers have been active in addressing these through updates.

In summary, Dyson Sphere Program offers a compelling mix of automation, resource management, and strategic planning, making it a recommended choice for fans of the genre. The game's ongoing support and updates suggest a commitment to refining and expanding the player experience.",1705199340,1705199340,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Fair warning: I basically come from Satisfactory (and I love it), and I never played Factorio because the 2D world didn't feel inviting.

The horrible user experience I had during my two hours of gameplay was just too much; I had to request a refund.  For this I believe there are two main culprits: the extra step in constructing buildings, and keybind hell.

Unlike Satisfactory, here you don't just ""craft"" materials, you ""craft"" buildings!  Meaning, even though you may have all the materials for a given building, when you go to place one down, you'll be asked to go in the Fabricator and ""craft"" the building first, then place it down.  To me, a casual gamer who likes a streamlined UX, this was a rather big disappointment.

As for keybinds, I guess my problem stems from the added camera complexity of a 3rd person game.  In any case, I constantly struggled with the controls, and I'm sure this is at least in part due to my being a casual gamer.

Actually, another big problem I had which is related to keybinds, is the constant ""double click"" to place down buildings.  Maybe I'm just too used to Satisfactory and its custom toolbars, but having to constantly select a building type and then the actual building I want to put down, was a chore.

I mean, if you have all the time in the world you can take the time to get used to it all, but my free time sure isn't what it used to be, so I lost patience very quickly.

In conclusion, if you're a Satisfactory fan and not a Factorio fan, beware the stark difference in UX.  It might be even better for you, but it was way worse for me.",1705081796,1705081796,False,3,1,0.387081116437911987,0,True,False,True

The game even with this modest loop is enough to easily sink hundreds of hours into which is more than I can say about a lot of games.

The positives:
The gameplay itself is very smooth, the tech tree is pretty straight forward it's very obvious what needs what and what does what
Even someone with no real background can intuitively understand the basics
Just getting to a second planet is probably enough to get more than your value out of this game

The deltas or things I want to see:
Given the Developer is actually active there's a few things I sort of wish that they decide to do.
1. Co-Op mode. This may be complicated to do but it is very very worthwhile. The ability to play with friends and exchange resources would easily pump much more gameplay into this game. As it stands there's a lot of folks who will never try this game but would if their BFF was playing. I've played this with my partner but the lack of interaction even playing side by side makes it less of an interest for her.
2. Variability in planets - Right now there's planets which are akin to Biomes of most games, they spawn at a semi regular interval with differing characteristics which is neat. However every planet is exactly the same size and it gets to the point really quickly where the only thing you care about is setting down some miners and leaving. The home system you start with is honestly a pretty terrible place but unless you're keen on losing hundreds of hours of play moving elsewhere is simply not feasible. There's no way to really 'improve' existing planets, about the best you can do is pave over everything and turn it into a super dense building planet. Something as simple as smaller and larger planets would be so much more interesting. Also if we can build a dyson sphere multiple astronomical units in size, can we maybe build a planet? I'd love to be able to say, yeah my home system is shit but I built three new planets and now it rocks.
3. Variability towards the same end - As it stands there is no real variability which prevents certain ideas, want to have a cooler starting area than the original Terra world? Wana start on a lava planet? A Blackhole? etc. you can't really do a lot of this because of the gated nature of the game meaning you can't get key resources without which you can't really progress to the next stage or if you force it you're super hobbled for hours while you try to do something which is pretty easy otherwise. For example there's like 3 ways to get refined oil, there's like six ways to get energetic graphite. There's no way around the fact your planet doesn't have oil. Coal seems to exist almost everywhere (which is sort of weird). Meanwhile something as simple as Hydrogen, literally the most common resource in the universe (which we can make with water and two electrodes) can't easily be harvested for a ridiculously long time.
4. Please please give us factions. The dark hives are cool but I couldn't really care much about fighting them. What I would give for someone I could exchange resources with, an AI planet I can make friends with or even my own 'people' (whatever those may be)
5. Lastly a lot better tutorial, currently it's nearly impossible to get into the mid game without following a youtube tutorial, which great if you stuck around that long but if you didn't you're missing out a lot. A little bit of a guide on how to upscale your structures, how to prioritize next steps efficiently, how to design things intelligently or even how to make a dyson sphere (the name of the game) would be so nice. In the end I copied a bunch of people's blueprints cause the time sink to do this myself was not worth the payoff which is a shame. Much more importantly there's like a dozen different commands and shortcuts which are not explained ever in the game. The number of people who don't know how to copy paste a recipe, or settings, or auto fill with drones or ships is staggering.

Overall I would recommend you buy this game. My asks are just asks because I believe a whole lot more people could be playing this game and would play this game if the developer addressed them. I look forward to the future they come up with.",1705027598,1705027598,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its in the same category as Factorio and Satisfactory (and plenty others) but its worse than both of them. DSP has some really neat features and it does shine at times, but I do not recommend it. If you really want 3D spaghetti go play satisfactory but if you really want to travel to space in Factorio then go play the space exploration mod (or wait for the DLC). If you want to play the game, just buy it. If you want a reason not to play the game, read the rant below...

[b]This is Factorio except...[/b]
... The buildings have a fixed size while the grid has a dynamic size, this is an absolute nightmare. The grid on which you place things slowly converges since in DSP you're building on a globe (like Super Mario Galaxy). This is a neat and novel concept but it breaks the game in so many ways. As you travel away from the equator the entire grid slowly shrinks but the buildings you place do not. When placing buildings back-to-back either there could be enough space in between for an entire powerpole while sometimes there is not. Sometimes even an inserter-tube wont fit and sometimes even the 2nd factory wont fit. This reduced me to tears several times. It is such a hassle to make nice orderly Factoies in DSP.
... Blueprints cant be used everywhere.  Blueprints can only be designed for (and used on) a certain gridsize. If you have the perfect factory then there is very little chance of being able to reuse it because you can only really paste that blueprint on the same latitude. Don't expect to be able to use it in any other location. This really defeats the purpose imo. 
... Blueprinting doesn't work for conveyors/ inserters. Disclaimer: this one could very well by my own fault. My factories are mostly modular, a chain of repeating segments. Need more throughput? Just paste another segment at the end. When pasting a new segment, but belts would never connect. If the existing belts would overlap with the blueprint the game would complain ""unable to place blueprint"" and when force-printing they would not connect the belts. If you place all the belts beforehand and then just blueprint the buildings over that, then the inserters wont get placed. In my experience you would always have to 'fix' your factories after you blueprint them. That is not how its supposed to work. The workflow should be design-build-copy-paste-paste-paste. Instead in DSP it was always design-build-copy-paste-build-paste-build etc etc. 
... Your character has a hunger meter. I don't know why this exists but you have to fuel your mech or the game will pushing you and stop you from playing the game. Alarms go off, the screen blinks red and you mech slows down and cant perform most actions. Trees count as earlygame fuel, you can build fancy high-density powercells later and you can build wireless charging spots so most of the time its fine. There is no upside to this mechanic, its completely trivial and if you run out of fuel while you're trying to deal with attackers your weapons switch off, you die and its game over. To me, this is not a good game mechanic! Please just copy what Valheim did!
... You have less than 10 logistics request slots. I mean, come on. You're gonna be handcrafting all day or flying back and forth to your mall the whole time. Both of these drain your energy, etc, etc,

This game is one of the most amazing game I've played for automation / auto building etc.
But the last patch with Dark Sphere is really wrong.

You can destroy the Enemy really fast, you can upgrade less faster because of that, and the Dark Fog is just a nuisance in the game. Not strategy, it's only slowing down the paste of the game.

I think I've restarted this game over 20 times, last time I did it with the dark fog activated, and I hated it so much that I don't want to play the game anymore.

How to beat the game:
1- Have a good seed, mine was 67822426-64-A99
2- build like normal, add more on defence
3- do not block any hole for any dark fog planetary, just destroy their base and ship, and keep those turret in place.

4- Once you can destroy the hive. Destroy and fill all the holes made by the Fog itself
5- Destroy the fog itself.

- There are no options yet to simply upgrade buildings and conveyor belts. You can place conveyor belts over existing ones; this however is tedious and only a small distance can be covered OR you have to delete the belt/building and replace it entirely. The latter is also tedious. -> EDIT: Fixed with version 0.6.16.5759! Now it works like a charm.

My Major Issues (as of 01/08/2024)
1. Dyson Swarms having a timed life means that they are essentially wasted resources from the moment you unlock them (early game) until tens of hours later after you can actually build the Dyson Frame.  A much more sensible progression would be to replace their timed life with an upper limit on how many you're allowed so the concept of maintaining and upgrading your Dyson Swarm stays relevant throughout the game and not just ignored until the end.

2. Grid/UI quirks.  So many quirks.  A blueprint designed at the equator should not randomly stop working if you paste it north 30 tiles.  Belts and sorters and their random contortions and refusals to behave consistently were by far the least fun and most frustrating part of this game for me.  

3. Proliferation needs a major rework.  As it stands, Proliferation is too cheap and easy to implement the massive returns it gives.  You also solve it exactly once and use the same ""blueprint"" for the remainder of your play through.

It's a super fun factory game with honestly a scale I wasn't expecting at first. It'll start off like any other factory game, you'll be hand crafting a lot but the moment you start unlocking that first bit of technology, oh boy do things ramp up quickly. The new Dark Fog combat is also pretty well done, even the base turrets with basic ammo feel impactful at defending your bases, they are easy to keep fed with ammunition but the balance of what turrets should be used instead of just spamming as many of one is a great system. It's balanced through the ammunition supply you have so unless you practically dedicate an entire factory/planet to ammunition creation (which I have no doubt will be a thing I will do in the future), it's easier to have a few different ammuntions at play so every turret outpost you make keeps firing when the Dark Fog arrives en masse.",1704759236,1704759264,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Part of the problem with DSP is the constant awkward interfaces and controls that make it harder to engage with the game, or the stilted awkward voice-overs that feel like they're being read by an AI, but a bigger part is that the gameplay doesn't feel that rewarding. 
Research is very bloated and uninspired so it's more tedious and time consuming than it should be, planets are all similar with only a few differences in resources so it's more annoying than anything to need to go to different planets, and there really isn't an overarching goal that you feel like you're building toward (besides maybe building a Dyson sphere around all 64 suns, which would take 100's of hours).

A mix between factorio and satisfactory style logistics, the research tree and upgrade trees are interesting, the pulled back view of your factory(ies), being able to see an overhead view of many buildings at once makes it way less intimidating than satisfactory (for me). The pacing of new items and logistical challenges for routing belts and clustering certain buildings together feels very natural and enjoyable. The ability to launch into space whenever you want is really fun, I'm looking forward to further space exploration and setting up different planets. 

The enemies are rather lame at the moment, they'd probably be more interesting on difficulties higher than normal.

I like space games.  Which is why I bought this but haven't bought Factorio yet.  And this is pretty decent just as a space game -- where the biggest emphasis is on planetary and technological development. 

So why a good space game?
1. Fairly realistic distances.  This is one of my biggest complaints about some game which are fantastic in every other way.  Planets are points of light in the sky until you make a journey and not hanging in the sky like a menu to choose from.
2. Good variety of planets.  Would like to see more, of course.  But it was quite an adventure to come across a waterworld and figure out what to do with it.
3. It is good for a lot of play.  I mean what bigger project can there be than to build a Dyson sphere?  

Room for improvement?
1. Better automation with conditional elements to control operation of other elements.
2. More variety of planets including more size variations.
3. Should be a way to get water on an ice planet.  It even teases you with the visual effect of the ice melting under you but still doesn't let you actually get that water.

The game provides plenty of tools to help of course, and the design challenges with the planetary grid you build on being segmented, such that blueprint builds can't be placed between them offers an opportunity to consider designating each to a particular purpose.

Of it's drawbacks, there aren't many. Controls to fly around in space are a little floaty, and eventually the desire for an autopilot technolgy to take you between planets is missed. The Personal Logistics tech feels like it's still missing an advanced tier, where currently each container with a logistics hub can only be set to supply or demand a single item. A secondary tier to this tech would hopefully offer the ability to maintain a certain content. (Such a feature would allow for chest with logistics to direct attach to an assembler and provide it all materials needed, simplifiying the build to provide all buildings via personal logistics)

What makes this game different are ""technical visuals"". A fact that you can actually see individual sails shot at the star at the specific position around it, while forming your custom-designed pattern around that star makes for truly spectacular views and feels. A lot of effort was put into that visual part of the game, WHAT player can see. Very well done by developers.

The same goes for effortless and fluid transition from planet surface to space. You can see and experience rotation of planets, tidal-locks, resonance (speed of rotation to speed of orbit around star) is really fun. I'm (very) amateur astronomer, so I used DSP many times as visual guide to explain space-related phenomena to my son, friends and family.

[b]Very cool game as factory builder, but also very interesting visual guide to space and planetary systems and mechanics of it all. DSP doesn't get enough recognition and credit in that regard.[/b]

You played Factorio for x thousand hours and after that tried games like Satisfactory and etc but nothing ever grabbed you like Factorio did that first time. So from that perspective...

This game is something else man, it is a breath of fresh air for the niche genre. At first you get the idea that it's like the others, cheap Factorio clone, but then you get a little deeper and you go wait a minute, this one is different. It's got a little bit of Anno in it too with the transportation routes. Think of the ships and how you would build trade routes in Anno 1800.

I think the only warning I would have is that if you are not an experienced factory game player, you will likely find a lot of this a bit more difficult to pick up.

I would say the main issue holding this game back is everything is centered around your view point. You can't view other planets you have factories on. You can't build warships to beat back the Dark Fog that aren't in your inventory. If you're not on the world every other world is just a chest that produces resources for you to collect.

navigating the tech tree is interesting (in the it's buggy kind of way) as you have to figure out the techs required to produce the product you want.  

There is a basic flow for combat tech, but limited combat units.  

The automation is also kind of buggy.  It's the kind of buggy you can work around with a programmers mindset, but the point of the higher techs is that you shouldn't need to, and therefore rework your entire factory to increase function and production.  Currently that is unnecessary.

Needs balancing, lots of balancing.  Part of that can be done with the starting statistics but most of that needs to be done on the game itself.  There isn't even the basic archer < spearman < horseman < archer balancing system... yet?

However, the game is fun if just bones right now, and therefore functional.  I think the game could become a nice RTS for both creative players and ladder players if the game is built out properly, even just by copy pasting unit types.  I would also like to see more unique species/archtypes.  I think this game would benefit highly from an artifact tech tree that can be built on and added to the basic tree creating entirely new tech trees.  It would even be cool if the tech tree started vanilla and basic but still carried through to the end, but was better off by being added to with other micro and full races, dead end research and entire 'side plot' sections to research.

The developers' dedication to improving an already outstanding game is commendable and keeps me eagerly anticipating the future update on space combat.

From the moment I started playing, Dyson Sphere Program captivated me like few games have done before. It is hands down one of the most exhilarating games I've had the pleasure of playing. It's a perfect blend of Factorio's intricate resource management and Satisfactory's satisfying construction, offering an unparalleled gaming experience.

The epic scale of building your galactic empire is mind-blowing. Even before the combat update, this game had me hooked, but since then, it's reached phenomenal heights.

The introduction of the Dark Void as an adversary is a smart inclusion in the combat update. Its gradual ramp-up in challenge, synced with the player's development level, is a thoughtful approach. This pacing ensures that the threat it poses remains proportional to your progress, never becoming an overwhelming or existential menace that detracts from the construction experience. It maintains the core enjoyment of crafting your galactic empire without compromising it with undue disruptions from combat encounters.

My first few hours started a bit slow, but once I understood blueprinting, and building things on a very large scale, it got to the point that I was dedicating entire planets to certain types of automation and operations.  In my last game, I even made an entire planet covered in factories for nothing more than science so I could crank out science on a massive scale.

The music is relaxing, the atmosphere is great, the graphics are beautiful, exploration is fantastic.  You can make the game very easy and it balances future rewards for things you're doing, or you can make it hard and get more rewards at the cost of as much difficulty as you'd like.

The new addition to The Fog adds complexity that requires you to really keep your head on a swivel in how you build your base for defense.  

At first glance, it may seem very much like automation can't be or isn't complex.  Once you get the understanding of large scale use of stacking and sorting, doubling, using the sprays, and all the other things that can be mixed in, you can have a very complex factory that works on a huge scale.

The game is very well optimized and runs smoothly, even at large resolution, and even with huge scale factories.  I have noticed with the new fog update there are times when the litter and huge swarms getting destroyed have caused /some/ slow down, but it's a new update, and just like the others, I imagine it will be optimized in no time.

So whether you want to just sit back and relax and make an interstellar factory and build a massive dyson sphere, or whether you want to build factories and play tower defense (and offense too once you get a fleet), there's honestly a ton to do in this game for those who love automation and factory building games.

The galaxy is really awesome to explore as well.  Sometimes it's fun to just warp over to a huge star and check it out, or go see a black hole.  Literally the only complaint I have which is more a feature request than anything, would be some added automation in the future to allow for logic choices on belts and sorters with a true/false, if, else, then statements of some type so things could be made even more intricately.

You may be the type who just wants to go yum spaghetti on your first factory or two, but once you pick it up and start playing with things on stacking, you'll find very quickly that you can make some awesome factories (or really large scale spaghetti :P ).

If that's not cool enough, you can even customize your robot, build up his armor to look cool, recolor it, and really go ham on that too!

It's also great you can export your blueprints to strings, share them with friends, etc.  Highly recommended if you enjoy these types of games.

TL;DR I have a few hours into it and it's a great factory game, now with tower defense and offense mixed in (if you want).",1703579682,1703579682,True,1,0,0.514170050621032715,0,True,False,True

It's an automation game. An automation game which does what every good automation game should: Building things. Building BIG things. Even better: sitting back and WATCHING as BIG things are built. DSP is very good at that. Automating a giant factory to make a gazillion hyper-advanced science cubes per second is fine and well, but you know what's even better? Watching HUNDREDS of SPACE LAUNCHERS and ROCKETS all coming together to put the goddamn SUN in a cage made of solar panels so you can squeeze every drop of energy out of it so you can do it MORE and BIGGERER but this time FASTeR until every star in the vicinity is yours

Now you might say ""but this looks like something that wants me to use my brain"" and you might have a point! Base building games usually feel like putting a logistical puzzle together, but if that's not your thing, fear not. Just paste some blueprints from the internet for the parts you don't want to do and you'll be good to go. Don't let anybody tell you you are playing the game wrong. Programmers copy code all the time and they still get paid for it

I regularly find myself stopping whatever I'm doing and just watching my screen in amazement. Be it the dance of the celestial spheres, my hundreds of drones flying gracefully around the factory, or my half-complete dyson sphere rising over the horizon. The game is absolutely beautiful

Framerate remains stable despite having several planets covered in poorly designed production lines. Flying (or warping) from one planet to another is as smooth as it gets. I kept thinking ""hah i bet this will make the game start chugging"" but it never happened. It's very easy to forget this game is made on Unity. Yeah

MOD SUPPORT. MECHA CUSTOMIZATION. BLUEPRINT SHARING 

You can even paint on planets if you want. That's right, write something crude on the surface of a planet in letters so huge its visible from space. You know what? Save it as a blueprint. Save the entire PLANET as a blueprint. That's right, the whole thing. Now you can make every planet look like that. Let them know who owns it

Simply put, the game start super great, and it's satisfying to do progress throught the game. But as the game progress and become more and more complex, it reach a point of complexity that truly started to hurt my brain.

It start like: ressources A and B give C that you combine with D and A again to get E.
But toward the end, except the entire alphabet. like: A+B=C+Ax2=D+Bx3+E+C*=F+Cx4+Ax2=Gx2+C+B=H And now you now You need H in mass quantity for everything in the late game.

But in the mean time, the factory line your have carefully design is no longer working since you runned out of base material and now have to rethink your entire production line and constantly find new mining point else your entire empire dies from not being able to produce mirror for your swarn, and if that happen you can consider your game as dead.

I manage to reach the dyson sphere but it was a freaking nighmare on the end I basically lost all taste in the game while making green matrice and almost pell of my chair when trying to think how I could make the artifical sun station work.


And now they are adding swarm alien against you... Like people saw what a mess the game was already, and thought ""This game need more difficulty, we need enemy that gonna eat the ressources you were already laking of, enemy that gonna destroy your stuff, that you didn't had enough of before, and since they gonna progress on their own you have now a new time limit to compete with. but don't worry, you can defend yourself with constant ressources drain cause you probably had too much ressources anyway LOL""",1703371909,1703371909,False,4,4,0.429510712623596191,9,True,False,True

The recent Rise of the Dark Fog update adds combat to the game and an insidious robotic enemy which perfectly complements the slow-paced factory building, unlocks a sizeable new tech tree and gives you a purpose to your endless exploration and expansion. 

I've been a fan of the game since shortly after launch and dropped around 400 hours in it prior to this update. Honestly I was feeling a bit nervous about it, wondering whether they'd be able to pace it right or if it would interfere too much with the core of the game: I can only say that they've managed to implement it in a way which is perfectly in sync with the rest of the game. 

The Dark Fog mostly ignores you and grows slowly (and you can customise how fast and how aggressive they are before you start), but as you expand your factory the threat meter starts to rise. This mechanic allows you to see clearly how close you're getting to an attack and so you can plan ahead, which reduces frustration and gives an urgency to your actions that the game previously lacked. Attacks start off small and limited but each time they grow stronger as they adapt to you. Having said that at the moment the weapons you get really do make quick work of most attacks so it'll be interesting to see how the late game behaves, but there is the promise of some pretty spectacular light shows once you get the full force of the Dark Fog Hive on you.",1612221270,1703365653,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

Never in the 210 hrs I have played this have I gotten a crash, heavy lag or BS glitches/bugs. Just goes to show how much a lot of big studios have lost the true passion of making an actual good and fun game that more importantly  actually works. Just a bunch of big wigs who couldn't care less about what they make and just want to  pump out the next cash sucking turd they can. While sucking the souls of the people who actually make the game out.  This is made by a small team of Passionate guys who have a vision and execute it perfectly.   The most recent Dark Fog update is such a change of pace and is a fresh reward for noobs and experienced players alike. The best part they gave this whole update to us for free to enjoy, no making it a packaged up DLC despite over a year of development. This is a game I will strongly support through it's development and would highly recommended it to anyone who like building, space and logical thinking. 

TLDR - pros and cons 

PROS

- Runs smooth as silk even in mid and surprisingly well even late game 
- Well designed worlds and fun and challenging builds 
- Huge blueprint crafting ability to greatly cut down on redoing the math/design of builds. 
- combat (if you enable it) is pretty fun and feel like it's in a good spot haven't played the combat side sufficiently enough to give a proper comment on it yet. (will edit soon)
- controls feel pretty good, space travel can be tricky but can be figured out over time but have improvements to be made.  
- I like that you have to craft special research cubes as a set resource feel like you really have to work at research. Can see it being a con to some people. 
- easily 100 hrs + of content to fully explore if you take your time and enjoy the game. 

Cons/things that may turn you off from it

- it's a brain heavy game, lot,s of logical thinking and math for load balancing and micromanaging is a core part of the game. For some this may be more of a brain workout the you want from a game. It has a sandbox mode but it robs you have the core fun of the game. 

- space flight from planet to planet can be tricky at first and very frustrating while learning and missing the planet for the 5th time getting launched into the void of space. 

- Some parts are really slow and you will have to just wait on production as you will have to manual craft a lot while you try to setup automation for certain things.  This is a long haul game with lots to do. 

- some production lines can be stupid long in later game 

- space battle feel kinda empty to me and has lots of room for growth. This update is new and they did a ton of great work but as it stands space combat is in need of some work but still fun all and all.

Beautiful game with active and transparent developers. One of the best factory games out there. New content and systems continue to be added. Even without Multi-player and combat this game is ship-able. 

Nothing beats flying through a star system that generating a sphere, watching the planets orbit the sun and moons orbit the planets. Or watching a sunrise while working  on some planet deep in the start cluster.

Dark Fog Update:

I was skeptical that combat is what this game needed, however, the execution of combat fits in so well with the game. Enemies are dynamic and need to mine for resources like the player. They respond the the player's actions, but also not not overly annoying. Watching their bases in space grow is beautiful like everything else in the game.

Additionally, new logistics options have made base building much less of a chore.

DSP is good.  Like REALLY good if you're a fan of factorio/satisfactory or similar.  Yes you see that ""Overwhelming Positive"" rating on steam is there for a reason.  Well I am sufficiently Whelmed. 

DSP starts out as an interesting planetary factory building simulator, you can roam/fly around a whole little planet sphere (takes approximately 30-60 seconds) and set up resource collection, distribution, and fabriaction centers.  Once you get the hang of this and advance into a science tech-tree, it starts to open up and let you explore a solar system full of planets, then a local star cluster full of different stars.  

The main game sees you researching progressively more useful tech and managing resource chains across planets and star systems.  All of this becomes more power hungry, so you end up building a pretty beautiful and epic dyson sphere to collect the power from a star and beam it back to your base. 

While early on your bases may look like conveyor belt spaghetti, there is enough automation and management unlocks that your final bases will probably look like an interplanetary drone swarm.  There are a couple of interesting bottlenecks around sometimes handling liquids, sometimes handling solids, and getting to upgrade efficiency of systems in various ways.  The ability to lay down blueprints and terraform is greatly appreciated too.

The good:
- Space elements are top notch. If you enjoy space stuff in general, the experience is a fun one to just look around and explore in.
- Game improved 10 fold with the Dark Fog update. Having enemies really helps the pacing/excitement.
- Getting around is easy. This is compared to Satisfactory where it takes 50% of the playtime to just get between factories. 
- Distribution drones are amazing.
- I'm sure there is more cool stuff that happens at the interplanetary stage as well.

The meh:
- The translations sometimes have mistakes in English (its early access, can't really be mad at that)
- In-game guides and tutorials sometimes make the game more confusing instead of more clear. It's worth it to watch a video of someone playing/explaining the game before you start.
- When playing with Linux + Proton there are sometimes issues with the audio. (light static that happens maybe once every 20 minutes of gameplay.)
- The music doesn't really fit the theme, so I usually pop on an audiobook or the interstellar OST.
- You have to start a new save each time an update comes out if you want to play that updates content. I know there's no way around this, but would be nice if you could opt-in to new content in your existing save.

If you like Factorio, this will feel conceptually similar, but with very pretty graphics.  Despite the more complex graphics, they are just as easy to read and parse at a glance.  You trade trains and circuit logic for grander logistics networks (with robots very similar to Factorio's) and the challenge of building on spherical planets.

The exploration side of the game is what separates this from Factorio.  By default, you spawn on a moon, and its rotation and orbit around a planet are always accounted for.  You can look up in the sky and see not only the sun, but the planet you orbit around.  Pretty soon, you can fly around your little moon and experience the day/night cycle, but soon enough you will fly to other planets in your solar system -- when their orbits come close enough to yours.  Eventually, your solar system will feel small and you can venture to others.  It is a very satisfying sense of progression, and the planets are chillingly beautiful.

This game is a masterpiece of engineering and space exploration, seamlessly blending complex resource management with awe-inspiring cosmic construction.

First off, the core concept of building a Dyson Sphere around a star is not just ambitious, it's breathtakingly executed. The level of detail and planning required to harness the power of an entire star is both challenging and immensely satisfying. You start small, mining resources on a lone planet, but soon you're orchestrating a galaxy-wide logistics network, a testament to the game's incredible scale.

The graphics are a treat - the planets, stars, and the vastness of space are stunningly rendered. Watching your automated drones and factories at work against the backdrop of the cosmos is a sight to behold. The day-night cycle on planets, the intricate machinery, and the smooth transitions between celestial bodies create an immersive experience that's hard to step away from.

Then came the Dark Fog update, which took the game to a whole new level. The introduction of the mysterious Dark Fog added a layer of intrigue and challenge that was missing before. Navigating this new obstacle while expanding my interstellar empire added a fresh twist to the gameplay, making it feel like a whole new game.

The update also brought quality-of-life improvements that made the game more accessible without sacrificing its depth. The developers really listen to the community, constantly tweaking and improving the game based on player feedback.

In conclusion, Dyson Sphere Program, with its Dark Fog update, is a gem in the space strategy genre. It's a game that challenges your planning skills, rewards your creativity, and constantly surprises you with its depth and beauty. For anyone who dreams of conquering the stars, this game is a must-play!",1703035941,1703035941,True,3,0,0.522456765174865723,0,True,False,True

The lack of good default keybindings AND the inability to set them on my own means that I basically have to play the game with a mouse.  I don't have F keys on my keyboard, so I can't access anything in my hotbar.  It's just simply not ready yet.  The UX of this game needs a serious once over because there's really no reason this shouldn't copy more from Factorio UX, like item picker, hotbar and inventory screens.  Fabricator has too many buttons to build things, should just be left/right click on items.  This kind of stuff needs to be sorted out before you add more systems to a game.  I'll try again on 1.0 I guess.

Edit after dev response:

From what I can tell, you cannot rebind the Function keys required to access items on the hotbar in the games settings.  I would much prefer a customizable hotbar instead of a static one that requires two button presses to get to what I want.  At the very least I'd like to see it be the same keys, like 1 to open power then 1 to select the first thing in that bar, not 1 to open power then Fn1 to open the first thing in that bar.

Additionally, the fabricator is too slow to interact with, it needs fewer clicks as well.  Left click to build one, right click to build five.  No need to fiddle around with the +/- that can only go up to 10x anyway.  Additionally, just combine inventory and fabricator into one screen (inventory already shows anyway) and then you can use the other keybind (e or f) for something good.  

Another example: the keys to move belts up and down are the arrow keys by default, which means I have to remove my hand from my mouse to select the level then go back to my mouse to place.  This is a terrible default keybind.  Scroll wheel would be much better in this case.

These kinds of things are what I mean when I say the game feels very clunky.  If I'm incorrect about any of these things please let me know, but right now I don't believe the game's rebinding is sufficient to fix these problems.",1702785530,1702827058,False,2,5,0.368205517530441284,1,True,False,True

 2. No official support for modding (All what you got so far is at the: https://dsp.thunderstore.io/) - Check - They released part of the source code (I still did not saw the source but it exists)

EDIT:

TLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker


Played again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.


- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.

- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...

- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)

However, with the new update, it brings the SPICE that was missing before. To be able to defend yourself against the armada that is going to inevitably assault your base, you'll need a LOT of guns. And to operate those guns, you'll need a lot of resourses, and what's more important, a B*TT TON of energy.

It's not that the entry is ""difficult"", but the sci-fi nature of the product chains makes them appear quite random and uninteresting at first. But there is some theme and logic to them, and the basic factory builder/exploration gameplay loop works well.

Fittingly for a sci-fi factory game, it does feel like you're starting right in the late-game of other factory builders. Blueprints, drones and flying are available early and conveyor belt management is greatly simplified with the easy availability of stacking and drone transport.

Nonetheless, there are very rewarding milestones  beyond that. The first expedition to another planet, interplanetary logistic, and then once more for travelling to a new star system all feel great.

Restarting is also quite rewarding. Other than in titles like Satisfactory, you do not have to do a lot of grinding and exploration to get back into the fully developed late game. While it's many hours of fun tinkering to get there at first, blueprints and experience will let you easily get back to that stage on a new savegame.

Finally I do quite like the comfort features, although there are a few drawbacks:
+inventory management is quick and easy. I spent much less time micromanaging my inventory, and you can automate almost all of it quite soon into the game! You will probably manage it a fair bit in your first attempts, but it's quite fine even then.
+belts have few restrictions and are fun to work with
+blueprints are quickly available and mostly fun and easy to use
-blueprint creation and use can be a real hassle near the poles of a planet due to the curved grid (fortunately you can play around this by building your larger production facilities near the equator)
-editing blueprints is very limited out of the box. You cannot keep the filename/name/description/icons of a blueprint while re-reselecting its buildings.

Overall I'd say 7/10 for general audiences and 9/10 for people who like factory builders and are willing to overcome the initial drag of dealing with the rather unintuitive product chains.",1702574428,1702574428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Edit: I found the idea at the base of this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP44EPBMb8A

WOW! just wow guys, congratulation for this dev team, 5 devs with great ambitions.

This is Factorio with Space Exploration, Satisfactory with multiple planets, Planetary Annihilation with production chains, Kerbal Space Program (I just ricocheted from orbit planet because my speed was to high) and even more, that you must discover and marvel. 

Each planet is unique, many common resources but some of them are rare and you hunt them because they can change your game completely. The mech is great, you ca travel with him around the land, air, orbit, space and beyond.

With no errors after 9 hours and (5 more :) ), polished as was Factorio after 3 years. They learn from the big guys and came stronger, better and beautiful. And this is just the beginning, we are in alpha and they have more to show, combat, modules, improved mech ...

At this price, even if you will play the game over a year or two, you must have it on your collection.

Will I still play Factorio after over 1200 hours? Maybe, I don't know but Satisfactory for me has no sense, excepting the nice 3D visuals and trains!

DSP >>> Satisfactory >> Factorio
DSP is by far the prettiest factory game and it's not even close. 
Satsifactory is pretty, but not close to the DSP level.
Factorio is ugly as sin.

Logisitics Complexity:
DSP > Factorio > Satisfactory
DSP allows spaghetti belts with low overhead, but interplanetary + interstellar is complex
Factorio is 2D and you can't just make anything go anywhere.
Satsifactory anything can go anywhere.

Tech:
DSP > Factorio >>>>>> Satisfactory
You can REALLY feel DSP scaling 
Factorio feels ""normal""
Satisfactory feels unnecessarily grindy.

Power systems:
DSP >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Factorio/Satisfactory
You'll find out why.

Downward pressure (enemies/etc.):
Factorio >>>>>>>>>>>>> Satisfactory > DSP (...FOR NOW...)
Factorio has the smog system, which is excellent.
Satisfactory has basically ignorable nonsense.
DSP has nothing ...yet.

Resources:
DSP > Factorio >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Satisfactory
DSP scattering unique resources across the star systems is EXCELLENT
Factorio is solid and you have to get to/provide defense for resources
Satisfactory has infinite resource wells defended by near-ignorable enemies

Personal opinion:
DSP > Factorio >>> Satisfactory

Factorio is COMPLETE and the mod scene is WILD. A+

Story: TBD

Story: TBD
The story is being actively developed so I’ll hold off on assigning a score to this. The premise is solid though. I don’t really play Dyson Sphere Program for the immersion but the gameplay in the context of the game’s story wouldn’t break any immersion.

Gameplay: 10 / 10
I find the game to be the perfect combination of resource management and idle automation gameplay. The progression is perfectly paced. Even if your system is efficiently automated, there’s always something you can go do. Figuring out more efficient methods of resource production and accumulations scratches an itch in my brain and Dyson Sphere Program is the perfect delivery system for that.

Graphics: 8 / 10
Space graphics are excellent. Flying around the solar system and passing by the sun hits a certain sci-fi vibe that is fairly rare in the genre. It’s reminiscent of games like Elite Dangerous in terms of space scenery. It’s well executed. Planetary graphics are where the improvements can be. Although this is likely a moot point as planets become industrialized and concrete/metal replaces the original scenery.

Sound: 9 / 10
The soundtrack for Dyson Sphere Program is perfectly suited for the game. It’s atmospheric and upbeat tune makes it extremely easy to listen to and likely facilitates getting lost in the sauce. I will say that the soundtrack is not an essential element. This is a game where you can kill the music and have something else playing in the background like a podcast or audiobook. The only room for improvement that comes to mind would be getting Hans Zimmer to score the soundtrack.

Multiplayer: N/A
No multiplayer at this time. The game doesn’t need it but doing this with friends would be interesting.

Additional Features: 10 / 10
I haven’t touched modding, yet. However I will give high marks for the community and dev’s making it extremely easy to get mecha customization files and blueprints. The dev’s have also been pretty solid with communication and setting/meeting timeline expectations.

Dyson Sphere Program has a few nit-picky flaws that hold it down.
-Space flight between planets is awful.  If you miss on your first pass it is almost impossible to steer yourself back to the planet you wanted to land on.   Face-planting into a planet just where ever you happen to be pointing so you don't miss.  Then spending 2-3 minutes flying around the planet to where you actually would have wanted to land in the first place is obnoxious.  The game should either allow you to steer more precisely.  Or provide a ""landing pad"" style structure you can simply select to fly to and land on each planet.

-Ore collection is just Ugly.,,,  a ring of collectors with belts coming out all sides and merging together is just sloppy.   The game should provide a structure that completely covers the ore deposits and  provides outlets on all 4 sides.

-Some of the production chains and available tools for routing items in the early to mid game are simply just obnoxious. The game opens up and improves in this aspect once you reach logistic bots.  However coming from Factorio I would appreciate  a better system in the early game for routing supply chains that work together and continue on into the mid to late game instead of ripping it all out and rebuilding it all as soon as bots are available. 

-You start with construction drones which is a nice upgrade form Factorio, however you also cannot hand place anything which is a huge down grade from Factorio.  Meaning you rely on a few bots to construct everything, even if you feel like your mech is standing right there and could easily plop the building down.  This actually seems to slow down and extend construction throughout the entire game.

-Soil Piles are obnoxious in the early game. Foundation should work to level the terrain without additional need for an arbitrary resource, that can only be gained by lowering other terrain... 


-upgraded sorters could use an upgraded range to pull from belts or buildings more tiles away.

-spliters could use an updated hitbox to be stacked tighter together.  should not need an empty tile in ""bus systems"" between belts just to fit splitters in.

-There are no resource transport systems like trains in this game.  You get belts and bots and that is it. Which is fine, once you unlock bots/cargo ships/etc the game opens up and trains would not be necessary.  however in the early game it translates to a horrible painful experience of belt spaghetti that all has to be redone as soon as bots are available.  It makes you want to just abandon your starting planet and start over on a new planet instead of continue to add on and improve.  In Factorio for example your starting base stone smelters feed with coal could easily last and continue to work into the late game, only really needing to be phased out at the mega base stage.  However in DSP almost everything you have built before unlocking Planet and Inter-planet Logistics is trash and needs to be rebuilt ASAP to proceed onward.

-I understand that planets are spheres and that it is impossible to make a grid system work with a sphere 100%.  This game does an great job of shifting the grid around and making it work out.  Building east to west is generally fine and works out not causing to many issues.   However when, mostly in the early game, you are forced to build north to south, or run belts north to south, things get odd and ugly. This is coming from someone with OCD who is possible also diagnosed autistic, but the odd left and right jumps when the grid system has to change heading North and or South is jarring.  I feel like there could at least be a more pleasing change to avoid such sudden shifts in what would other wise be a straight line. 

-Mech walk speed is so slow.. Even with upgrades it is painfully slow.    flight speed is equally slow for moving around a planet.  Even with upgrade this speed is to slow.  There are no other options to quickly move around a planet.  Space flight is to fast and to uncontrollable to be used well on a planet level.

I enjoy complicated logistics and supply chains however when the game does not give you the resources at each research stage to accomplish those chains and logistics in a logical and neat manner it can be very frustrating.  The solutions that are built should be able to last into the end game without having to be completely redesigned every step of the way in order to be mess of belts.

I came at this game after playing Factorio, Satisfactorio, shapez.io, and many other colony sim/factory style games.  And still my experience was frustrating.  I can only imagine that if this was your fist factory game that you would give up way before having a change to experience what the game really has to offer.

DSP is one of my favorite games of all time and none of my gaming friends know about it!  Every person I ask ""Have you played Dyson Sphere Program yet?""  They answer ""What's Dyson Sphere Program?"" and then I have to shoot them dead and fire up the wood chipper.  No, but seriously, DSP is the best game out there that ""nobody"" knows about.  I've been playing PC games since I owned a Commodore 128 back in 1986, and I was playing games on PET computers before that.  DSP is easily one of my favorite games of all time.  If you like building giant factories across multiple planets, this is the game you want.  It got a 97% approval rating overall and a 98% approval for recent reviews.  That should tell you just how good this game really is.  $20 is a STEAL for how much work has gone into this game and amazingly all of it works!  You will easily rack up hundreds of hours of play time before you are done, and right now the game is 60% done.

EDIT:

In a nutshell, DSP is a great game.  I leave the game running for weeks at a time with zero crashes and zero bugs.  These guys are doing it right.

I think we can safely say that there are at least 3 factory/base building games now that will really put people's logistical skills to the test:  Factorio, Satisfactory and now Dyson Sphere Program.  I've played all 3 games to max level several times and it doesn't matter which of these games I play the experience is FUN!  Say goodbye to the rest of your steam library.  These 3 games will kill thousands of hours of your time.

The main differences between the 3 games are as follows:

1) Factorio is a 2D game with all of the sprites angled at 45 degrees to make it look 3D.  Because everything is procedural, base sizes are nearly unlimited.
2) DSP is a 3rd person builder and everything is 3D.  DSP takes place across multiple star systems and planets.
3) Satisfactory is a first person builder where you are the character.  (Also 3D)  Satisfactory only has 1 game map but it's a HUGE map, and all of it modeled by hand.

Honestly, I can't believe that they are selling DSP for $20.  That's a steal for how much game time you'll get out of this.  I've got more game time out of this one game than games that cost over twice as much.  If you like building things and mental and logistical challenges, this game will more than satisfy that need!

FACTORIO:  ""I am the best building game ever made.""

DSP:  ""Hold my beer...""
Satisfactory: ""Hey wait!  That's my job!""

Sooo, 2,000 hours into game (I leave it running 24 hours a day) and I've been letting it run for at least a couple of weeks now on my second play through.  This game is DEEP.  I've finally managed to research all the techs to the point where I understand how everything works, and that just shows me how badly I've been planning!  I don't want to lose this game when I'm so close to the finish line (I'm not good at math...) but half of me wants to just scrap it and start over.  Here we go again!

EDIT:  My second play through went much better.  

Hint: remember where you put things or you'll have to go looking for them later.  Not fun when you are working with multiple star systems each with multiple planets.  I suggest keeping notes on what planets you have been to and what you built there.  Unfortunately there's no way to quick view inhabited planets, you have to remember which ones you colonized.

Note for next time:  ramp up warper production to ludicrous.  Every single interstellar station needs them for each ship departing.  UGH!  Huge amount of resources to make that happen.

I may sound like I'm complaining, and I am.  But it's damn good fun getting lost in all this.  

Definitely got my money's worth and this is only 60% done? Damn!

I've tried getting into this game like 5 times and inevitably drop it a couple hours in after getting annoyed with how slow the early game is. As soon as I want to start expanding into a larger factory I have to wait minutes for 3-5 slowass drones to place conveyors one by one. And your own run speed is just. so. slow. Get a planet with coal and stone on opposite sides from your starting area? Prepare to run for 60-120 seconds from one to the other.

The tech tree needs to be more streamlined. Take Factorio as inspiration and feed in new buildings and recipes one after the other rather than all at once in a shotgun blast at the start. None of the research is even properly gated behind the different tiers of research cubes. I shouldn't have to dig through pieces of the tech tree that I can't even begin to research because I haven't yet researched the required stuff yet.

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of things this game does right too. I still remember how awed I was the first time I booted this game and was flying through space to the starting planet. The sheer scope of the game and sense of wonder in slowly expanding across the galaxy is a big plus. Factory building and maximizing efficiency is great too.

  Pros / Reasons to get this game :-
 - Easy to understand and play from the off, ingame instructions are excellent.
 -  You always feel like your advancing with upgrades/ abilities at a regular rate. No mid game mountain to stall progress
 -  You can zoom close in or pull back the view and the factory system remains distinct and easy to understand.
 -  Fly through space ! 
 -  Create transport drones to deliver resources through your network of planets and drones to keep your Robot Ai supplied 
 -  Everything works in a simple to set up manner.
 -  Despite the gigantic scale and multiple systems at play, there's no slowdown.

There is something so satisfying about setting up a great late-game chain, flying to another star to set up some additional supply sources for vital materials, and coming back to your home system to see just how far along your Sphere has constructed itself while you were away.

The game is technically in Early Access, but you wouldn't know it other than the 3 small techs that say ""in development"" on them.  It's stable as hell and seems to run quite well, no matter how many planets are churning away and sending supplies back and forth.  If the devs said ""no more updates"" tomorrow, I'd still have 0 regrets in buying and playing this.  

Well, I guess I would have 1 regret; the hours I lost myself in this game could probably have been better spent doing something productive.

Edit: 2 1/2 years later and I still highly recommend DSP.  The additional buildings and the tweaks to ratios have made the game even better.

If you love resource gathering / colony building games, you'll definitely want to give DSP a try - honestly feels way too good for a $20 game, even in Early Access - it really does deserve that Overwhelmingly Positive rating :)

There's a definite learning curve to figuring out sorters, conveyor belts, drones and the other automation tools, but once you do, you'll find that you can fully automate everything if you have the research and resources for it.

>> Protip: Sorters have enough reach that they can carry resources over other conveyor belts, meaning you can use them to ""bridge"" intersecting conveyors without risking traffic jams, or pull resources from a distance if you have multiple conveyors with different resources in parallel and you need to draw from the conveyor that's furthest away.

You can also stack storage buildings and research labs on top of each other, which makes transporting resources to them a lot less cumbersome..

Here's some screenshots if you need a visual guide -

The attention to detail in the design of structures, machinery, and celestial bodies is commendable and adds to the game's overall appeal.

Moreover, the soundtrack complements the gameplay perfectly, evoking a sense of wonder and grandeur as you delve deeper into the universe. The atmospheric music enhances the immersion, making every discovery and accomplishment feel monumental.

The community support and developer engagement further enhance the experience. Regular updates and a passionate player base contribute to a thriving environment where ideas are shared, strategies are discussed, and the game continues to evolve.

In conclusion, Dyson Sphere Program is a triumph in the realm of space simulation games. Its blend of strategic depth, captivating visuals, and addictive gameplay make it an absolute must-play for fans of the genre. Whether you're drawn to interstellar logistics, complex resource management, or simply exploring the vastness of space, DSP offers an unparalleled and immensely gratifying experience that will keep you engaged for countless hours.",1700760362,1700760362,True,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,True

Dyson Sphere Program checks all the boxes for a successful Factorio style automation game, and does an excellent job of setting itself apart from the pack. All of the traditional elements are here, conveyor systems, assemblers, component stacking to create higher tier components. However, the multi-layer building possibilities make for some stunning layouts, or messes of spaghetti, but it's entirely player choice how they want their factories to look. Beyond that, you have a miniature galaxy at your disposal to harvest resources and set up supply lines between worlds.

The progression in Dyson Sphere feels very fluid and meaningful. New components and modules become relevant as soon as you research them and challenge you to reconsider your layout and re-prioritize resource allocation. As you research new upgrades for your mech suit, you'll be able to travel into space and utilize resources from other planets in your system. Further on this expands to other systems with their own planets with rare resources that can used to replace entire manufactured components. Recipes will occasionally have multiple combinations of ingredients that accommodate these rare resources, allowing you to create components much faster. In the late game it can become difficult to remember which planets and factories you have made to create a certain resource or component, but the game does give you the ability to name planets and has menus that show your operations on other worlds, something I should make better use of.

Dyson Sphere Program has nice looking graphics and reasonable system requirements. The art style, while not especially groundbreaking, is coherent and fits the atmosphere nicely. There is also customization for your mech suit allowing you to create your own designs, though I will admit, the editor was a bit over my head and is basically a cut-down 3D modeler. I found myself more interested in building my factory than what I looked like, but this is personal preference. There is a gallery of player made suits you can download online as well if you're not inclined to make your own. Over all the customization and aesthetics of Dyson Sphere are very nice.

The negatives of Dyson Sphere Program are honestly few and far between, and very minor. There are some localization issues with the English tutorial narrator and text prompts, but nothing bad enough that you won't understand what's being talked about. If you stop playing for several days and come back, it can be a bit daunting to remember where everything is or what you were doing, but this is true of any automation sim. I have experienced a handful of crashes and memory leaks after playing for several hours at a time, so save often, but no bugs or issues I would consider game breaking.

This is over-all a fantastic addition to your game collection and is one of the most polished and feature-complete Early Access titles out there. Definitely worth buying at the incredibly reasonable price of $20 and is a no-brainer, especially if you catch it on sale.

Whilst the game is good for what it is, it does suffer some drawbacks.
Pro's
- Easy to pick up and play
- Just the right amount of challenge in standard 1x resources mode
- Plenty of community made blueprints available
- Upgrade path is easy to understand
- Tutorial guide spells things out for you
- Hopping from planet to planet is seamless*
- Dyson Sphere
- Mods are allowed
Con's
- Whilst mods are allowed, a lot of them are out of date or don't work correctly. BeltSpeedEnhancement, for example, doesn't work correctly.
- Alongside that, blueprints are severely out of date, or are big for no reason. I often find myself building a planet blueprint, only to realise to my horror an hour after completion that it just doesn't work, or despite having 2x the required RAW input, it's not making the advertised xP/M because they literally made you build 20 smelters for 1 line of ore, but only 10 get filled at any one time due to belt speed limitations
- Speaking of planet builds, lag is a common occurence. Even running with a 3080 and an i7 11800, placing a planetary blueprint will tank the CPU and GPU
- The performance issues can be addressed by giving the player the option to turn off building previews after the blueprint has been placed. This is the leading cause of lag.
- The game can sometimes suffer errors and bugs that will tell you Meta data isn't sync'd, thus disabling achievements. This is a known bug and hasn't been resolved yet.

This game is extraordinary. It's Factorio meets No Man's Sky. It's No Man's Sky if there were no base building limits.

The fact that belts can go over each other, grabbers have ports, and belts can go over water really makes the game that much more fun.

For context I would rate base factorio a 7/10, and space exploration Factorio a 10/10. If you like automation, and like space, you'll love this.

My only qualm about this is the lack of extensibility from mod partners and lack of a circuit network. If there was a greater modding community like there is with factorio, I think this game would result in overhaul mods that would be the best experience I've ever had.

I also wish there were more difficult automation puzzles like there are with Factorio space exploration. I've never been as overjoyed as when I automated my first cargo rocket. I wish ILS and PLS in this game had the ability for granular control, and that ability was necessary for some stage of the game.

If you're not an addict and want to know more, Dyson Sphere Program factory game with a mix of traditional factorio stuff, simplified/streamlined you see in Satisfactory, with some interstellar logistics and power generation on top. Not as ugly as factorio (sorry babe still love you) but not as pretty as satisfactory. It's 3D and you can use verticality in your logistics but it doesn't get as vertical as Satisfactory. The research tree is bigger than Satisfactory but smaller than factorio. I know I'm comparing it to those two games a lot but those are what I consider to be the 2 pillars in automation games and I'm guessing if you're looking at Dyson Sphere, you've played one or both of those.

Factory games usually leave me with an urge to replay one of those 2 games, but not Dyson Sphere. It has elements of the best automation games out there, while also having its own personality and take on the genre. With the more futuristic feel and added logistics of ships going between planets it really scratches its own itch. It's really high quality and really easy to pick up. Tutorials are helpful, the user experience is pretty great, and the difficulty curve of the game is pretty easy going. There's really almost nothing negative I can say about it. The devs care a lot and content updates are consistent and meaty (they're adding combat soon). This is not even to mention the cool community stuff they have like designing power armor and a giant galaxy map showing the star systems with the highest power generation. There is a ton of depth if you wanna get really really nerdy and generate insane numbers, but you can also just play it like a regular factory game where your goal is to just complete the tech tree. 

This game is addicting and stimulating its own special way, so much so I would consider it to be the third pillar of automation games. If you're into to factory games at all I think this is a must play.

Leider hat das Spiel ein paar Negative aspekte. 

Mein PC ist nicht der schlechteste:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X (Wassergekühlt und leicht Übertaktet)
RAM: 32GB Corsair Vengeance 3600Mhz
2 TB Samsung 970 Evo (Game drive)
GPU: NVidia GForce RTX 3080 10GB

Nicht mehr das neuste aber spielt noch fast alles. Ich spiele das Game auf einem 1440p (QHD) Monitor also 2k. Die Grafik ist Schön, simpel und Genial, das Problem bei Dyson Sphere Programm is die CPU. Das Spiel ist Unglaublich CPU Lastig. Wo meine GPU max 30% Last schafft, ist die CPU ab einem bestimmten Punkt im Spiel fast dauerhaft zu 80-90% Ausgelastet.

Das größere Problem, die Entwickler werden wohl nicht viel dran ändern können da die CPU Belastung von den Logik einheiten, den Drohnen und sdonst was kommt.

Meine Empfehlung, wenn ihr keine gute CPU habt verzichtet auf Logistik Drohen und Logistik Bots, die fressen ne Menge CPU.

ADer rest? Nicht viel zu sagen. Nach 200+ Stunden mein 5ter run in DSP (Dyson Sphere Program) und es macht immer noch undglaublich viel spaß.

If so, you ain't seen NOTHIN' yet!  Before too long (give it another 500-2000 years), earth will be the proud child of a sun that we can no longer see, because it will surrounded by a gigantic sky-enveloping Dyson Sphere!  No more solar eclipses... it will be eclipsed all the time.

And this future - this is what you get to build in Dyson Sphere Program.  Doesn't that sound neat?  Except in this game, you are apparently a lone robot in a desolate lonely solar system, with no other people or life - apparently some civilization sent you here to build up their Dyson Sphere for them to help harness all the stars' energy in the Milky Way.  This civilization is well on its way to becoming a Type 3 civilization - capable of harnessing all the energy in a whole galaxy!

You can read more about the Kardeshev scale here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale

You start out the game with nothing.  Apparently your mother civilization that send you here is leaving it to you to figure out how to research all the technologies to convert the planets you find yourself on into the end product.

Because there are no hazards, you can take all the time you want.  But making things more efficient is really the name of the game, as you don't want to wait exponential time for things to get finished.

WARNING: This game will NOT play on a laptop mouse pad.  That part is the worst - I have to go sit at a table with a mouse.  However, another program called ""VoiceAttack"" allows speaking commands that would normally be issued via the mouse - and this works around the problem, although it's a bit clunky and not as fast as using a mouse.

Other than that, the game plays very much like Satisfactory or Factorio - you know the drill.  Build bigger and better factories while finding resources.  Only this time, some of the resources can't be found on your home planet - you'll have to fly to a different planet to extract them.

It's still in Early Access, but it plays quite clean so far.  I have had some very minor hiccups where I wasn't able to fly, and I think it was related to running out of fuel but the ALT key still had to be hit to free something up.  These minor issues should all be fixed eventually and this wasn't a big deal.

If you only ever played one factory game - this is the one!

LUCKILY I didn't. I went and marveled, for a day, at the large and very positive response, SO many people can't be wrong... if they're not wrong, then it must be me.

I decided to try again but first I wanted to Google and watch youtube videos as the game's advisor tips are not very good. After a small ;) 12 hours of reading and video viewing - BINGO!!

For God's sake hang in there and give it time. Do like me and watch some Youtube videos ... little by little the game opens up for you and suddenly you are sitting, like me, with a huge smile on your face and just can't let go of the game. :)

I've played 70 hours now, under 14 days and haven't even left my own solar system...this game is HUGE!! - LOL!!

Another warning... you are at high risk for severe lack of sleep... and food... ah!! I don't have time, I can pour something inside in 14 days time... Well! don't have time to write more here, have big and extensive plans to attend to. There is ALWAYS something new to investigate or make.

I've been enjoying building games, economy games, management games forever. I think WarCraft and its superior successor, StarCraft, got me hooked on the bare-bones starting from scratch to a mighty empire kind of thing.

I'm playing this right now because I played Factorio for a while (finally bought it after being on my wishlist for like 6 years...) and that was after playing a whole bunch of Satisfactory.

Apparently I like factory and management games lol I'm a nerd.

You play as a Mecha. Yep. Just your run-of-the-mill robot agent to the stars. The game begins with your wittle capsewl fwying to da pwanet...why am I talking like this? Sorry. You fly over to your starting planet, gently land and NUKE THE ENTIRE INDIGENOUS CIVILIZATION MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

No, could you imagine? lol...

Start by collecting the landscape around you. Thankfully, there are no green activists in this system so harvest as much as you'd like! Use it for fuel but after a couple minutes go find some coal and use that. Then smelt the coal into energetic graphite and use THAT. THEN, make hydrogen fuel rods and use those. And then just nuke the hydrogen and make deuterium for fuel. Then antimatter. Then...um...build a....thing...

.....................crap.........what was I doing? Something about a program...I think I have to build a...huge...um...

Beach Ball! No...no that's dumb. I'm dumb.

I rank it at the 4th place between those because, Factorio is the king of the genre, Oxygen not Included offers amazing gameplay and the most elaborate puzzle solving of all, Satisfactory is incredibly beautiful and scales up quite nicely for it's size.

Placing DSP at the 4th place doesn't mean that it's bad, in fact it is equally great but it doesn't quite offer the Factorio scale up although it holds on it's own at some parts, especially logistics. However it has the least puzzle solving from all these games and while it's a very pretty game, it's not even remotely close to the Satisfactory world in terms of beauty.

DSP has to offer the amazing goal of building Dyson Spheres, the interplanetary and inter system travel and logistics.

This was my introduction to factory games. I am hooked.
If you like any sort of engineering, or science, you'll love this game.

I find it difficult to get my head around where my inefficiencies are. The game doesn't do a great job informing you when something isn't working, or is stuck. There are alarms that you can manually turn on, but as a newcomer to the genre, I had no clue when it was a good idea to do that. This might just have been my issue and learning experience. 

If you've never played a factory game before, this might not be the best starting point for you. 
HOWEVER: Personally I found other options a bit intimidating, and the theme of this one is just too good. If you agree, cannot recommend this game enough.
If you don't care about space, or the idea of a Dyson Sphere, then I think there are better factory games out there for you.
If you like other factory games and get super invested in the logistics, then this game might bother you a bit, I've read that this game does have some odd number mis-matches in the factory chain, so everything doesn't work perfectly all the time. But if you can overlook that, and just accept that your factory will be at least a little inefficient, (or a lot inefficient, if you're not an actual engineer) Then this game's theme brings so much to the factory genre that it is just one you cannot skip.

It is beautiful at all times, and there's always more to explore. Now, go harvest a star!",1670445787,1698140759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The UI is outstanding, building is intuitive, there seems to be quick way to do everything need edwith a couple keystrokes or do using only the mouse if that is preferred.   Information is presented in very usable form.   The Blueprint system is great and useful as you build bigger and bigger things.

+ Dyson Sphere Program is an exceptionally solid purchase even at full-price if you enjoy automation games (e.g Factorio). Achievements and built-in aspirational goals encourage multiple playthroughs.
+ ""Early Access"" is laughable in the most positive way. The game feels feature complete with multiple end-game goals, achievements, etc. Solid buy in the current state.
+ Quality of life for factory building and logistics is high. For example, conveyor belts can be raised or drawn around corners. Logistics (local, planetary, and interplanetary) is also a simple supply and demand system.
+ Interplanetary logistics is a core mechanic and required to complete the game, setting itself apart from other automation games. Interstellar logistics is highly encouraged due to higher resource density and rare resources that simplify production chains.
+ Dyson Sphere has more interstellar exploration and mechanics than Starfield. Feels amazing when you use the gravitational mass of a star as a slingshot to increase your speed. Feels terrible when you pass your destination at 2000m/s then run out of fuel and drift aimlessly into space. At least you feel something.
+ The Dyson Sphere is not a required for game completion (to my surprise!). You can start the Dyson Sphere/Swarm in the mid-game and progress as you expand research and production.
+ Completing the Dyson Sphere requires so many resources it's more of a ""end-game"" or ""mega-base"" victory. This gives more casual automation players an reasonable conclusion without too much investment, but more dedicated players have a concrete, aspirational goal.

[h3]Cons[/h3]

- Many mid-to-late game components have room for improvement. For example, some have long production chains of intermediaries with often two but occasionally only one use. Alternative uses with new content or more efficient recipes would increase the value.
- Navigation within a planet is challenging in the late game. I frequently found myself flying in circles around a planet looking for that one production line. However, Foundations in DSP can be colored to help organize production lines, and there are some other tactics, like segmenting a planet by longitudes since north and south poles are always defined. One feature improvement would be an intra-planetary indicatory similar to what already exists between planets.

Started playing it for little bit and after a small learning curve, got sucked in.
Stopped for a while and then picked it up again after the updates and it has turned into one of those 'I'm just going to drop a few miners on this planet' and a couple hours later you have a full mining planet.

The graphics are beautiful, especially when you launch into space to check out your Dyson Sphere for the first time.
The music is soothing and calming.
The math can be challenging (but not necessary to enjoy the game)

There are very few bugs and they have made a ton of quality of life improvements in the game. And after you have built out your factory on a planet, you can have the pleasure of going back to optimize everything.

As you build your Dyson Sphere, you'll harness the power of stars to create a vast and complex industrial empire, stretching across the cosmos like a psychedelic spiderweb. It's a game that will test your sanity and your engineering skills, but if you're successful, you'll be rewarded with a feeling of power and accomplishment that is truly mind-blowing.

The game's procedurally generated universe is a never-ending source of wonder and amazement. There's always something new to discover, from bizarre alien planets to exotic resources that defy the laws of physics. It's like a DMT-fueled journey through the multiverse.

The automation system in Dyson Sphere Program is a work of genius. It allows you to create incredibly complex production lines that can run without your intervention. This is essential if you want to build a truly massive Dyson Sphere, but it's also a lot of fun to watch your automated factories running smoothly. It's like watching a symphony of machines working together in perfect harmony, like a giant cosmic ballet.

The first time you try to play you have no idea what the fuck is happening but the more you play the more you get locked onto it. Minutes turn into hours that just disappear in the blink of an eye. You start focusing on conveyor belts. You start thinking of ways to set up massive space factories.

Then as soon as you think you're done you unlock the next step and do it all over again. And again. And again.

You're going to get scattered like a junkie scratching at the furniture as your home planet looks like an absolute mess.

Then you're going to look back and hate yourself. You'll tear it all down and promise to do it properly next time.

So you do. You'll spend 5 hours pulling apart everything you've done and you start again. What was previously a mish mash of conveyor belts everywhere now turns into carefully and meticulously planned logistic systems. Your planet has sections dedicated to individual materials.

Unfortunately right now there are quite a few severe QoL issues, the biggest ones:
* blueprints basically only work if what you copied and what you're pasting were at about the same latitude. Even the simplest ones like ""two belts and a row of smelters"" refuse to work if you paste them a bit too high or a bit too low
* and if you don't use blueprints, placing large number of sorters is a huge much pain. If copying/pasting machine settings also copied/pasted associated sorters, that would remove 90% of this pain. Either that or reliably working blueprints, right now the game has neither.
* in-game help is obviously machine translated from Chinese - early game it doesn't really matter, but late game things like ray receivers, Dyson Sphere etc. are ""explained"" with some machine translated gibberish
* space travel is very unintuitive, and not really explained anywhere, and you can find yourself overshooting your target and lost in space with no energy to turn back and having to reload save. Or stuck on gas giant with no energy and having to reload save. Gotchas like that add nothing to the game, it really should just be ""point at planet, press button""
* there's a bunch of other things like for example it would be nice to have Factorio ""logistics trash slots"" for small things you pick up every time you rewire some belts, production summary could also include imports/exports, and so on, but such minor potential improvements don't cause problems the ways ones above do

And for non-QoL issue, single item ""modular"" builds with logistics stations are too good, and their alternatives (belts, bots, more complicated factories) too weak, so by mid-game everything looks the same - logistics station, some belts out, one or two rows of factories, belt back in, and maybe some extra lines for proliferators and warpers.

And to ""win"" the game, you need to produce 4000 white science, which takes forever, but you can't really speed it up much, so the game is pretty much asking you to leave it running for the last hour or two, while you watch Netflix on another screen. If you plan to continue playing beyond ""win"" message, then there's definitely stuff to do, but this is not great. Before that ""win the game"" tech, tech tree is quite nice.

If you're willing to overlook such issues, and early access Factorio had them as well, it's a great game. Expect something like ~50h to win the first campaign. Hopefully it will get even better by the time of its full release.",1694999176,1694999176,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Despite how hard I try to veer away from this game, it's almost impossible to get bored, even when you're in the late endgame—there is simply too much room for growth and scaling your factory to make more science, more Dyson spheres, more everything.

There is a sharp spike in difficulty—(I'd call it a learning curve)—between red- and yellow-science, and an even sharper one between that and purple/green-science. Be prepared to plan, don't forget about resource costs, space, or power. Just like any other factory game.

Still this one maintains a personal preference above others, simply because there's so much awe in exploring new star systems and planets, or watching your interstellar logistics highways soar across the star cluster from a distance.

Overall, it is still in early access, so it's a hit&miss.

I'd say that this game can land somewhere in the middle between Satisfactory and Factorio, which are both more expensive but stronger games. 

DSP lacks the polish in it's approach. While you're using belts, you do not need scale, most of the tech tree you pass with mere couple assemblers and you just upgrade them to faster versions. There's no explosive growth as in Factorio. Mostly, you are forced to move to logistic systems. However it is not because of throughput, but because of lack of resources on starting planet, some of them just do not spawn here. At the same point, game forces you to carry some resources manually couple times from other planets since you need those to build ILS, which is really inconvenient and points more to Satisfactory. You also can build belts on multiple levels which is closer to satisfactory, but production buildings are still mostly are flat. Would be way more fun if you could stack them as well, producing different products on different floors.

ILS itself feels too bulky for the time you get it and overall, but rather powerful. It even feels a bit OP.

I guess overall the game points you at extensive scaling, but it does not really require that, so at some point you just feel plucking a single building to produce one product and think: why? If I needed million items of this product, yes, I could scale, but for most of the products coupe assemblers is mostly enough. There's way too much overhead with ILS/conveyors per output required.

The final goal is really unclear. You just progress the research tree, pluck more production buildings, but rarely need to review or scale earlier parts.

Planets are all same size and I'd say they're on the borderline of claustrophobic compared to the building sizes. Wish different planet sizes (build-area related) were available.

A minor gimmick: wish it had more physics in the game. DSP points at cool sci-fi project, but there's more fantasy in the game than I'd like, unfortunately.

You have an option to scale up, but it's more optional post-game than mandatory and/or organic part of gameplay.

On the good side is nice graphics, neat production chain, smooth progression regarding the main character (not so much overall). Game doesn't have enemies, but if you want some meditative eyecandy experience with no bulkiness of Factorio, this game would be a really good experience even in current state, just don't expect too much of it as of yet.

If developers maintain the same smoothness of gameplay down the line when adding enemies and add a bit of reason for scaling, this can grow into a great title.",1694103259,1694103259,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,True

Sure the default game mode makes you work for it, but there isn't any threat in the game. I've ""completed"" the game in my opinion, I've built a Dyson Sphere shell and fully filled it in, I've also filled out the tech tree and gotten atleast one point in each of the infinitely repeatable tech nodes. Having said that, I'm glad I've completed the main objective of the game. I had gotten to a point of maintenance mode to where I could just let the game run and do its thing and me interacting with it would have only gotten marginally to the end goal only slightly faster.

In the end, it's worth playing, but I'm glad I'm done playing it. I was getting bored, but wanted to meet my goal for the game, so I pressed on. I don't see myself coming back to it any time soon. Trying to improve would only put in the tier of fanaticism or obsessive expansion. 

Putting it up against the two other games I've played in its space: Factorio and Satisfactory.

1) Factorio was my introduction into this genre. I don't think DSP got me as hooked, and I haven't been as compelled to do DSP's achievements as Factorio's. Factorio, though has its quirks, just feels more polished and the need to keep expanding in Factorio is stronger for me. The bit of aggro from combat in Factorio adds a more interesting element to the game. Expansion in Factorio has to be planned more due to threats, DSP has no threats so expansion is more of a getting what you need, warp there, setup a basic gather setup and ship it back.

2) Satisfactory also feels more polished then DSP. It also has far more mechanics than DSP. The mechanics of Satisfactory are also far more interesting. Death is always looming in Satisfactory on just the horizon, you as an engineer have to be clever and good to survive. Eventually, you feel accomplished in having reduced threats to minimal in Satisfactory though, but it is still there. The blueprints is far more polished in Satisfactory as well.

DSP is a good game, I do recommend it. If you are trying to decide between DSP and Factorio or Satisfactory, pick one of the latter two first. Then once you need a break from those two give DSP a try. I was disappointed to find no combat in DSP, but for some that might be a draw to it. Blueprinting in DSP can be annoying to deal with, laying out a design can break at different regions because of grid issues. I researched several tech nodes that I never saw a need for. Why would I want to stack more things on a belt when I can just move it faster? Why would I want to increase efficiency when expanding is just easier?

DSP is a good game, I liked it, but I didn't love it. It didn't hook me like other games in the genre.",1693814103,1693814103,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Lots of cool little things like all the planets in your solar system are visible in the sky and are to scale based on distance.  Eventually you will travel to those planets and moons searching for more resources to send back to your home planet to feed the research machine.  Eventually with enough technology and 100's of your real life hours killed, you can colonise other solar systems.

I could go into detail about everything, but it boils down to setting up your factory is slow and tedious. 
-Everything takes multiple clicks to set up. Inserters, assemblers, belts, everything. certain parts can be clicked and draged, but not everything. It tries to be smart about belt placement but fails.
-Z height stacking belts feels necessary for throughput but is a pain to deal with, as you cant directly move items vertically, and need to bring belts to ground level for many buildings. Additionally the UI for doing so is just generally not great.
-you cannot place buildings normally, and your bots are limited in number, slow, and chug your mechs power. This makes the already arduous task of building things at scale even more painful
-The nighttime sucks and you cant see anything at all. Kick your feet up lol!

I love Cities: Skylines, Oxygen Not Included and sim games in general, and I love sci-fi, so this was a predictable match. Still, this game unexpectedly offered me what No Man's Sky could not: The feeling of grandeur, of massive space exploration, of getting lost in space to slowly build your way up to conquering it and moving in it as if your home is everywhere. The landscapes are awe-inspiring, both the natural and the ones built by you, with amazing graphics.

But that's not the game's core. Its core is [b] automation [/b] , and the freedom on the speed to approach it is fantastic. Some people start automating everything away, crunching numbers and even making spreadsheets to find the most efficient factory blueprint. Some others, like me, were doing some things manually up to the point of getting tired and automating some of it, slowly but surely building our way to massive factories that nonetheless work like a charm. Except now that I expanded my processor factory, suddenly I'm not producing enough silicon...

DSP doesn't push you out of your comfort zone until you want, but you have to in order to advance, and it rewards you with that pride that only us creators know well. Making your factory work is quite easy. Making it beautiful, or bigger, or efficient in space or energy or resources, or whatever you want, that is up to you. And the 3D of it all just tops it off. You will feel all your other sims' maps too flat after this. You know you are in a sphere, and you want to.

This is by no means what you'd expect from an Early Access. I have been playing this treat for a year and a half, and it keeps getting better.

I would absolutely recommend this beast, 10/10 as it is now, even without the [b] upcoming optional combat update [/b]. With the update, though, I'm afraid I will need higher numbers to rate it. And holidays.",1692910288,1692910344,True,42,0,0.782600581645965576,0,True,False,True

This, Factorio, and Satisfactory, This is much closer to Factorio though, and even with taking Early Access into account, Factorio just seems the much better option.

Logistics just seems off, movement and controls never feel quite right, and because of this not being a native English speaking team, reading tooltips and your AI companion is a chore in itself. The Create function make worthy of factory expansion heavily. Did that read like nonsense? That's what a lot of lines end up being like. This probably will be fixed through full release but it makes playing the game now way harder. 

UI is my biggest issue probably. Some stuff is listed in per minute amounts. Other, per second amounts. You have to manually convert back and forth and it's just so... not good. And when you get to the complex logistical chains, it becomes way too much. Early game - or at least what feels like the early game, I'm close to unlocking the 4th level of science - the chains you have to deal with are far more complex than even what end-game Factorio has.

Early game Dyson Sphere puts you into Oil production. Oil production as a base creates two products, including leading right into Plastic which has no real way to spend until you get a few more upgrades on the tech tree. But then there's converting purified oil into acid for other things and the hydrogen atoms are needed for these rockets and... 

It's basically like, if you aren't already a near expert in this genre then you're just going to be boned. And this is before Combat becomes a thing. Once it does, how does that factor in? Factorio already ties combat into your normal production line. One of the science actively uses military pieces, so if you make it that far without a proper ammo production, you'll make one just out of a need to create science. Any extras at that point become offensive and defensive tools.

How is this going to tie into Dyson Sphere? I already feel like I'm being pushed to the limit. You have to set up interplanetary travel just to get required resources and it's just... too much. Complex, hard, and a chore to understand. I was hoping to enjoy this while I wait for Satisfactory to finally see full release some day, but I feel like I'll just be suffering if I do play more.

At the very least I could have hoped it did something unique, but it truly just does feel like Factorio but harder to understand and just plain harder.

Edit: So unliked, this is the first ever game I've tried to refund. Naturally was denied due to the slow burn of factory games surpassing 2 hours but... well, I tried.

Doesn't help that Factory Game players also seem to be the absolute most toxic people ever. It's a single player game and yet people love to be toxic.",1690509606,1692889271,False,5,8,0.46313813328742981,0,True,False,True

I get there because the game play is smooth, consistent, and easy to learn with depth that reveals itself as the network grows more complicated and requires new combinations and interactions of resources and manufacture. It's so smooth that there are times that the interface can disappear, and I'm able to imagine what I want to do and just do it.

This is the next generation of Factorio, although the logistics don't have the hyper-optimization that Factorio lets you create, with newer, more impressive visuals akin to what the original Kerbal Space Program creates as a routine part of just playing the game.

Finally, the developers are improving the game constantly. I return every few months to do a play through, and each time, the interface is just a little more polished, there are new ideas that can be used in the logistics network, the graphics are just a little sharper, and there's some detail like a new world type or new element in the tech tree.

A Rated !!!

There is one annoyance but doesnt need mentioning and is a bit funny.

There is a learning curve but not steep ... tutorial? Who needs one half the game is figuring out the game itself ... and I am a slow learner somewhat altho I am good at gmaes like this having played a few CIV type games ...

I will mention there are a few other similar SIMS out there like this however every single one of them you get to a point where you CANNOT really do anything productive and have to wait and let your computer run idle while you increase your research ... this one is the same HOWEVER there is always something to do here as increased research aligns perfectly with how you progress in the manufacturing processes.

Learn this game and you are simulating to test your engineering prowess. Logistics etc ... its in space and there are trees !

I also try to play minimalistically ... as I may improve my current processes to speed them up.

Learn your own blueprints ... yes there are some out there but if you take others blueprints you wont learn the processes and efficiency formulas.

It is massive.  The scope of the game is mind boggling, which mean it has longevity. 
It doesnt tell you what to do or how to play, but, it does offer useful guidance along the way.

The concept is ambitious. It is open so you don't feel like it compromised because it was going to be a console game or not (no idea, if it is or isn't) but the quality says it was designed to be the best it could be by a bunch of folk that wanted it to be the best it could be.

It is.  The way you can move between planets seemlessly is a joy.  The variety and imagination of the technologies you can research and the ways you can configure your production are a joy to behold.

It is a lot of fun and yet, very relaxing while being enormously addictive.

It is almost a god game.  It certainly has that perspective but it centers on a mech avatar figure.  The graphics put me off a bit at first. They are well drawn but I wouldnt call it beautiful.  But, nor do they impede the experience. I think a good balance has been struck here. Especially considering the vast scope of the multi planetary epic. 

It runs well. Not had a single crash or issue. Whether zoomed right out or close in, even with lots going on, no slow down and no glitching.  Another point of note is that unlike some other games, the game saves almost instantly, exits almost instantly for the same reason.  Not sitting there waiting forever for a save to finish.

The sound is ok. If there is one area of the game which feels a bit bland, this is it.  The music is nice but the atmospheric sounds and so on could have gone further. However, this is a minor point as the overall audio does not impede things. I just think it could have gone further.

Eminently re playable but it is unlikely you will exhaust your first play through as it is so satisfyingly massive in scope. 

A very welcome game.  It has the sort of massive scope and vision that has been sadly lacking for a long time.  We are talking interplanetary done with depth.  This is a masterpiece of a game. 

The tech tree and progress keeps drip feeding you progress and you have to think about your objectives and which to prioritise.

It does all this while being very addictive and yet extremely relaxing and enjoyable to play.   More please.

I changed my review to show a like.
Considering my hours, I feel I got my money's worth.
Also I really should play again as it has been awhile and I should see what has changed.
My big thing these days is most games such as this should have multiplayer. Am told there is a mod to do exactly that. My immediate thought is, why has the creator not provided multiplayer??

But continuing (until I play again).
Am on the fence with this.
About time Steam created a Meh/Maybe/Perhaps choice. Of course, Steam are like Apple/Google/""Fill Corporate Name Here"" and don't actually care about you, just your money.

Dyson Sphere
Beautiful, but empty research and construction game.
If you like Factorio, Satisfactory, then pay your money.

It just doesn't have the feel of something like Avorion (amazing game), Emphyrion and even Factorio.
I get that I am to build an eventual Dyson Sphere, but the getting there is Meh. It needs a driving force of some kind to make me want to get there.

Ok interface, pretty graphics.

No real challenges so far, no fights for time/survival/rewards.
Click research, build something to create materials to research, repeat endlessly.

An Early Access (EA) game, so hopefully will change and improve.
And maybe not.
You pays your money, you takes your choice.
Best of luck to the developers as they have a possible winner, just not for me at the minute.
But then who am I, just 1 in 7 or 8 billion on the planet so far.
Am going to keep coming back to play and push myself a bit further and see if more happens.

The game runs well and the gameplay and QoL is good for a early access title, although the tutorial narrator and English translations definitely need some work. There are also some frustrating elements regarding multiple outputs of materials that can cause clogging in some production chains, I feel there should be more ways to deal with stuff like that.

After building my first few Dyson swarm guns, I sat back and watched it populate the night sky. I was awestruck, thinking back to how much the very simple games of the late 70's and early 80's has progressed. I could sit back and watch the Swarm forming in the night sky while standing on my planet. Beautiful sight.

It has been awhile since I have had such a ""wow!"" moment in a game, but I have had a few such moments over the course of gaming in the past 4 decades. Those games become unforgettable.

This game is of course very similar to Factorio, so if you liked Factorio (as I did) you will like this. But the scale of the game puts it above Factorio in my opinion. Very addicting.

There's no tutorial and it's extremely frustrating to have to constantly TAB out of the game to find info on how to do everything. Games of this complexity MUST have a robust tutrorial and perhaps even beginner missions. Getting to another planet was hugely frustrating and end with me giving up on the game and writing this negative review.

As I said at the start, the game is wonrdefully crafted and engineered. There's a huge tech tree to research and tons of things to do. A lot of thought has gone into the logitics and physics of the simulation. This is where the deverlopers shine. Graphics are decent although I personally do not like the earth curvature aspect. 

My time is too valuable to be constantly in frustration mode trying to figure out which key does what. A lot of the commands are NOT intuitive. Some buildings provide an automatic conveyor connection while others require what is called a sorter even though it's only picking up an item from the conveyor belt to the building. Belts don't alwaysd line up with the input/output ports of the buildings so the sorters don't fit and you get ""angle"" errors. That's all part of early access of course.

If you'rew willing to sufferstruggle through the learning curve and like like industry/settlement simulation building games then you'll love this game, esapecially if you find it on sale.

I am a big fan of big budget franchise games (StarCraft, Half Life, CyberPunk, etc), and I was desperately looking for another game that would give me the same level of enjoyment as I have experienced in the past. I found that in DSP and much more.

The esthetics of this game are simply stunning, the vastness and possibilities are mind-blowing. The game play is well thought of, and the attention to details is impressive. The ambition is quite unique as you will be managing a civilisation from level 0 to level I, and then to level II on the Kardashev scale.

I absolutely loved the game play. It's a complex game with a somewhat long learning curve to get to understand all its features, but the learning process is just a pleasure. The game play is served at a pace that makes it easy to learn each next feature, you never get overwhelmed.

With DSP you are going to start with humble beginnings as a robot tediously harvesting wood and minerals by hand on a small planet. By the end, you will control and manage fleets of intergalactic drone vessels that will ship resources for you at a grand scale. One of the most interesting part of the game is how the whole game experience changes as you gain in technology and energy production capacity. At the beginning you are stuck on a small planet trying to get by. But one day you have enough resource to attempt your first exploration into your star system, and that’s an amazing experience. The views are absolutely stunning as well.

Big kudos to the developers of DSP. I haven't experienced any bug; everything works flawlessly as it should. This is impressive considering that the development team has been working on a budget compared to big gaming studios. Even the music is excellent. Always appropriate, focus-driving, and never boring.

DSP is amazing, I just cannot find anything to complain about. I am just eagerly awaiting the upcoming upgrades and game extensions. I can imagine how this game could evolve so you end up controlling entire galaxies as per the theoretical level III of the Kardashev scale. I just can’t wait what the developers have in store for us.

If you enjoy factory/process games like Factorio or Satisfactory, you'll probably like this one. It hits a sort-of middle-ground between them in that it's 3D, but not first-person.  

It's peaceful in that there are no enemies (they'll be coming in as an option later, as I understand it) so you'll be just playing to figure out the best way to do things.  It can be as relaxing or as stressful as you want... I found it to be a very relaxing game to get into.  Designing little segments of factory to streamline my production processes was quite pleasant.

In short... start on a planet with a mech... mine some stuff, build some stuff, research some stuff... set up a small complex to do all that automatically... then expand that to include new technologies... then spread to other worlds... find rare elements and incorporate those... and you can go from mining iron to make ingots, all the way up to antimatter storage containers and artificial suns.

You can set up quite a complex logistical system involving conveyor belts and drones. Surface drones, AND interplanetary drones. Mine on one planet and ship to another, etc.

The ultimate goal is to build a Dyson Sphere to power the civilisation that sent you to the galaxy.

You can 'end' the game by researching to an end-goal... or you can build to complete your sphere... or you can just set yourself a goal and keep going until you've achieved that.

Your factory can scale up an extraordinary amount. I was really amazed with how much could actually be happening with this game, and my (mid-range) PC wasn't slowing down at all. 

The game is very pretty... and seeing your Dyson sphere/swarm rise above the horizon for the first time is epic stuff.

There are a few quality-of-life things missing, but not many. I would've liked the ability to set up holographic signposts to remind me where things were, for example.  Trying to find the SINGLE factory you've got building 'x' component, when you've got a whole factory making stuff, can be annoying... but it's not game-breaking.

I finished this game in 123 hours by completing the research tree. I still only have my Dyson sphere at around 40% completion, with some research left to go on that to allow me to build it... so I could keep going if I wanted to. (I likely will).  I'd say this game has quite a bit of replayability.

Very-much recommended.

To be clear I started one save file and have stuck with it, this is made possibly only because of how accessible the game is to letting the player make mistakes, I'm still not actually sure you can truly 'waste' resources on anything as yet either, most of what is produced goes to another use or will be later on.

Where do you even start when all the other reviews covered all the key points? For one thing the game refunds all materials if you deconstruct stuff so you can feel free to rip apart entire lines of production and build it back more efficiently.. and believe it or not that is one of the most fun things thanks to the almost instant building mechanics. Huh?

Let me go into further detail, you don't actually partake in building yourself as such. Your character sends out drones that do it for you almost instantly and it strongly encourages the player to tear things down and build it back up, you don't really lose anything except some minor production time in the whole process either, though I suppose you could just build a makeshift simple conveyor to keep things running while you fine-tune the process.

The game does building on a planet which is obviously circular but then it wants you to build in directional patterns, with this in mind it is nothing short of impressive that the developers made such a silly looking concept work. It is barely noticeable too! Don't get me wrong I wasn't thinking it would be extremely awkward to use when I heard about it but I did have some reservations about how it would affect sprawling factories in the mid and late game and now I'm here to say at the early mid game it hasn't changed much if any of my original building plans so +1 to the developers on this.

Honestly this game draws me in with the allure of something that might be possible to build in reality in the far distant future and lets me glimpse what it might be like now, there is almost no other games in my library where I can say the same thing about them and it fills me with a bit of excitement to think that I can not only build a Dyson Sphere soon but I can gaze upon it. 
Adding onto the above let me just say building a ring of solar sails around the sun and gazing up at them is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking things I have seen put into gaming, no I don't speak of graphics or anything but rather the image you behold seeing them swirling around a sun is just.. I never get tired of looking at the ring I placed and it is truly impossible to put the pride you feel into words seeing it set up and functional.

Also what isn't shown on my account is the amount of hours I spent looking up what Dyson Spheres actually look like, what purpose they might serve, what the need to build them would be and many many other things that were nothing shy of the most fascinating reading material I ever read, on par with the marvels of science today I daresay. At least a few hours were spent just taking it all in, there's barely any other games that have given me the desire to go and look things up and provided me entertainment value outside of the game itself, it explored and introduced so many things I would have never read and I feel better for it, maybe part of this is because I know my generation will never see a Dyson Spere in reality.

Absolutely recommend this game if you're interested in factory building, I paid almost full price and I feel like 50 hours in I am still scratching the surface in some regards. The sense of wonder hasn't disappeared and the expected desire to restart is nonexistent, I feel like I could break from this game all month and still return and get up to speed with where I was previously, after of course I had a short walk of my factory and took inventory of everything.

The game also has absolutely brilliant storage and really makes me happy to be able to carry around so many things with me at once, there's no weight system in place so you just bolt things into slots and place them when needed. 

Almost at the end of my review but I must give praise to the recent logistics introduced at the end of september, the developers have given us buildings to place onto storage that will deliver to us the player or to other buildings after we tweak some simple settings. In the most simple terms this is a very effective and viable early, mid and even late game addition that lets us build anything within very generous range and have it hand (drone) delivered to us on demand, of all features I've seen this has to be the most genius thing about the game I've seen, I really appreciate this devs!!!!

That's all I have to say right now, I will likely tear this review apart later on and rebuild it better next time.. in the spirit of DSP ;)

THE GAME DOES NOT SUPPORT CLOUD SAVES AT THIS TIME, PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS BEFORE PURCHASING.

I couldn't get into factorio or satisfactory because it was missing the space element. This covers everything I've been wishing for.
I've only played ~90h so far and I can tell you I'm taking my time and discovering every little exciting mechanics in this game.
You can customize your mech pretty much as much as you want. Some people have crazy custom files that you can download to have yours looking like a Gundam or anything you want.
The space element is so awesome you can warp to other systems as much as you want as long as you have the resources to do so.
You can build small and slowly to research technologies (and there is a lot of em) or you can just build entire planets with dyson swarm and spheres as much as you want.
The game runs soooo smooth it's insane too.
I had this game on my backlog for so long and tried it when it first launched in early access but now we're almost at 1.0 and WOW.

If you're like me and you like space games with really good UI and graphics, customization and a lot of fun without feeling stressed by time limits and factories then this game is definitely for you!

PROS:

+ Visually spectacular
+ Cleverly executed sci-fi elements
+ Laying out factories and automating is great fun
+ Exploring the galaxy is great fun
+ The quality and usability of the UI is mostly extremely good
+ You get to build a freaking Dyson Sphere

CONS

- Some of the translations into English are ... real bad, like they just fed everything into a machine translator, but that is understandable while it's in Early Access.
- Sometimes the grid system on planets can be a pain in the butt to work with, like conveyor belts doing weird jinks and blueprints that work in one place but not another. But there will always be trade-offs like that when you're trying to use a rectangular grid system on spheroidal worlds.
- Some tedious tasks cannot (currently) be automated, like putting down orbital collectors on gas giants.
- The tech tree layout doesn't quite make sense, there are a few hidden dependencies that can be frustrating, like you can research Strange Matter, but you can't build the machine to actually make Strange Matter until you have researched this other technology from a totally separate part of the tree.",1688906168,1688906168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ich habe noch nie einen Early Access Titel gesehen, der so bugfrei lief und läuft und dabei auch so unfassbar viele Updates, QoL-Patches und Rückmeldung von den Entwicklern liefert!

Factorio, aber auf einem ganzen Planeten!
Das allein ist schon beeindruckend genug, aber Dysons Sphere Program erstreckt sich über 20, 30, 50 Planeten in mehreren Sonnensystemen!

Dieses Jahr 2023 heiß erwartet: Das PvE-Update!
Der Preis ist beeindruckend klein für DAS was es bietet 🤩

It's early, still lots of works, but again, with what there is already, its like minecraft on steroids, galaxy sized steroids. You will not be disapointed.

I'm also so glad this was published on steam, its an AMAZING ADHD rabithole, it satisfies the ripples in my brain better than most games.

-Dyson Sphere Program is a top tier factory building automation game inspired by Factorio.  This game absolutely rocks and still hasn't tapped it's full potential.  They have some pretty interesting plans this year, as they enter their third year in early access.  I found this game to be more accessible than Factorio or Satisfactory and has a gorgeous visual style.  It doesn't have the depth of complexity that Factorio offers, but it does a pretty damn good job competing w/ the juggernauts of this genre.  

Consensus:  
-Excellent Game (Tier 2 and makes up 25% of my reviews).  This game has the potential to be just as challenging, engaging,  and addictive as Factorio.  Even now, just two years into early access, it is a well polished, incredibly fun automation game that can easily give players hundreds of hours of fun.  This year, the devs plan to introduce some sort of weapon system, enemies, or some kind of danger that will add a much needed layer of challenge and stress to this experience.  I have a feeling that when it's all said and done, DSP will get my highest score.  If you love Factorio or Satisfactory, give this gem a try.",1686932624,1687021536,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Reviewer said you would end up divorced, and alone. I have to completely agree. I've not played any of these type of games before so I cannot compare them. I like the concept of creating a Dyson Sphere so I went with this game (sim?). I didn't watch or read guides. I didn't want to obsess with arranging things and balancing them until I figured it out on my own. Lots of fun. Just jump in and start playing. The game walks you through almost everything.

I thought blueprints would take the spaghetti band effect of the belts out of the game, instead I find them very helpful and I've taken to optimizing the blueprints to work better with each other.

pros:  multi-planet, multi-system, can make complex factories, blueprints, can customize resource difficulty for more challenge--no combat (can be turned on/off)  just yet but the devs are working on it.

Once I built my first dyson sphere, I kinda just stood there and went ""now what?"" That could just be a me problem because I lack intrinsic motivation to expand just for the sake of expanding, but I need a reason to expand, and once you build your first dyson sphere, there isnt really any external force making you want to expand to other systems or make more, which seems like a waste considering the dozens of other star systems you can go to with their own unique planets. Beyond setting up simple smelting operations for the few resources not available in your home system, I never went to 90% of the other systems and only ever visited those few systems a couple of times just to expand the output. I would love for a reason to build a sphere around a black hole, for example, but right now the only reason you have to do that is because it looks cool, which isnt enough to motivate me.

It's a deep and rewarding experience that offers countless hours of gameplay.

The game starts you off on a lonely planet with the task of building a factory from scratch. As you progress, you'll find yourself expanding to other planets and even other star systems, laying down thousands of conveyor belts, assembling machines, mining rigs, and power plants, all in the name of resource collection and automation.

The game's voxel-based graphics are beautifully rendered and the user interface, while complex, is intuitive after you get the hang of it. The visuals of constructing and observing your interstellar factory are stunning. There's something uniquely satisfying about watching your little drones buzz around, carrying resources to where they need to be.

The sheer scale of Dyson Sphere Program is impressive. You are not just stuck on one planet but can travel and harness resources from different planets and star systems. The eventual goal of constructing a Dyson Sphere around a star is a massive undertaking and a testament to the game's ambitious scale.

The game is not without its challenges. The learning curve can be steep, particularly for those new to the genre. But the community is supportive and there are numerous guides and resources available to help you get started. Additionally, the developers are actively working on the game, releasing updates, and communicating with the community.

In conclusion, Dyson Sphere Program is an excellent choice for fans of automation and resource management games. It combines a grand sense of scale with intricate and rewarding gameplay mechanics. Despite its complexity, or perhaps because of it, Dyson Sphere Program is a game that can offer hundreds of hours of enjoyment. I highly recommend it to any fan of the genre.",1686392636,1686392636,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

In this game, you can travel to other planets for different resources you may not have on your current planet. You can send resources (later on) automatically to the other planets in your system to automate the production of some resources. If you want an extra challenge, you can turn on limited resources and set the resource amount lower. 
While initially it may feel like you don't know what you're doing, it is so satisfying when you have finally automated the production of one vital resource and can then turn to automate another.

It’s an early access game so for those you usually have to take the good with the bad, but honestly even with a few complaints it’s more polished than many released games at the moment. It feels like playing a classic game of planetary annihilation without the pressure of competing with an AI that can put optimize and out micromanage you. Instead the focus is on building an engine of pure consumption. Everything can be broken down, everything will be used as some production input. Flying across the world and seeing my massive field of oil refineries churning out graphene and deuterium sparks joy. I can’t wait to actually start shooting shit into space, and mining clathrates from gas giants as I have just completed my second trip back from my first interplanetary colony. 

There are a number of things I would like to see improved before release. There needs to be much more information exposure. The tutorial videos included are borderline useless and linking tooltips a la paradox games and an in-game reference would go miles towards opening up the information space. This is probably the most important change that I’d like to see.

On a related note, what bothers me most about the game is the absolutely terrible English localization. A lot of games by foreign developers have a few mistakes here and there but in this game I genuinely have a problem understanding the tutorial write ups and voice overs. It harms my ability to grasp the systems I’m trying to build. I would love to see a significant improvement in this, because I need to know if my factories may pre-house the seamy side volitation. 

Aside from these few frustrations I would highly recommend this game to people who are interested in futurism and mega-engineering, people who loved Total Annihilation and its spiritual successors, people who want to feel like they are colonizing the galaxy, and people who like to relax by optimizing production lines.

First somes negatives....

Bare with the game... in my first 2 days I was thinking it was getting boring fast/research was unlocking tons of stuff that I had zero use for and I was just expanding a basic base with ""blue"" research aka green research in factorio, then red research 2nd and waiting. All these useless tech do become useful later.

Then I found the oil problem, found an oil seep many hours into the game, and had too little hydrogen/way too much refined oil and no idea how to get rid of it, assumed it was a balance issue but it's not... you will discover later on that this issue resolves and almost swaps around by purple research stage.

Then the last negative ... a lot of the items require silicon ... or later on titanium and I can only get those from manually mining rocks or a painfully slow rock to silicon smelter on the start planet.

Now the major positive.... you can leave the start planet and settle elsewhere.
If you bare with the game, later on you unlock the ability to fly to other planets, and build entire bases on them.. my first was a rock planet abundant in silicon, the second abundant in titanium. So I could manually fly back/forth and collect all the resources I need to make what I needed. This does start to get tiresome flying back/forth, if only there were a better way...

Later on... the game opens up a logistic trade transport system that allows shuttles to do this job for you, and you turn your secondary planets into mini factories for the hard to obtain resources on the home planet.

Then there's the dyson sphere, and inter galaxy exploration, and more... what you see in the first few hours is just a taster of what is to come, this game is already a masterpiece and it's still pre-release. I'd definitely recommend it and would love to see where it's going in the future - I bought factorio as a beta and it has grown constantly since then, can see this doing the same.",1685562712,1685563158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I do wish there was a recycler that could break down things you don’t need anymore into either their base components or maybe turn them into energy.

This game is, by far, my favorite of the genre. Placing buildings in a nice grid is easy, flying around between planets and solar systems is fun, everything tells you how quickly it can make or transport something, so it's very easy to just do some number crunching and get everything working perfectly. When I play other, similar games I find myself comparing it to this one and before long I want to come back and start a new game. I do find that this is the type of game you can sink a lot of time into and then once you get everything to a certain point you're basically done and might take a long break to play other games, but I have a feeling at least every few months I'll come back for more.

Previous review follows:

I've now played this game for over 150 hours, so I guess I like it, lol. The game has evolved quite a bit since I first got it, and things that I initially found frustrating have since been resolved, and I also better understand how the game works.

If you haven't played a factory game before, they are not fast-paced, high action games. Sometimes I will actually just walk away with the game running so it can build up a backlog of stuff I need, or do a bunch of research I have queued up, while I go do yard work or grocery shopping or something. Other times I sit there and admire what I've built, or break down a whole section of my factory and try to rebuild it in a more efficient way. The buildings tell you their production rate, so you're able to figure out exactly how many of each building you need to keep everything running smoothly.

I've stopped and restarted playing this game several times since I first got it, and there is a newer feature, I think they are called logistics bots (they look like flying fidget spinners) that has completely changed the game for me. No more mess of conveyor belts all over the place. Now with these short-range drones that fly things around (in addition to planet-wide and interstellar) I can make little hubs that just focus on one thing and serve that thing up to wherever it's needed. I used to resort to manually crafting a lot because I didn't want to deal with trying to work something new into the mess of my factory, but now I just pop down some storage containers, tell them what I need, and make a little hub for crafting just that one item. It's great.

As of this writing, the game is still in Early Access, but it doesn't feel like it. There used to be areas of the research tree that weren't available, but I think it's all available now (or, at least, everything currently in it is now available). The game has never crashed on me, and I can't think of a single bug that I've encountered.",1678039634,1685306804,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to automation games, I played some satisfactory and factorio, but both only for 5 hours or so, so consider this review about the game from a noob standpoint considering these types of games:

- What is DSP? It's comparable to factorio or satisfactory, but with its own unique aesthetic. If that doesn't mean anything to you: This is an automation game, where the goal is to build a factory (efficiently) with the eventual goal of building a Dyson Sphere (duh); a mechanical structure around a star which can harvest its energy. 

Pro's:
- The game is small in size (about 3gb) and was made in the Unity engine, which makes you impressed by what people can do in an engine like that (plus this game was only made by 5 people. Like, what the actual f***. Wow.) 
- It's a beautiful game. The soundtrack fits the theme quite well and never gets annoying or overwhelming, and seeing your factory build a sphere is just quite a sight to behold (look up some timelapses of people building dyson spheres on youtube, pure spacegasms). 
- The gameplay is fun. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of autmation, the game offers you enough creative freedom to build your factory as you see fit, while providing enough of a challenge to keep you on your toes. It takes quite a chill approach, given there are no enemies (yet), but you're kind of fighting the planet itself for resources, as they eventually run out and you'll have to come up with new solutions to difficult problems as you go. 
- The game can both be enjoyed in chill mode where you just build whatever you feel like, or you can go really hardcore into building the perfect efficient factory. It doesn't force a certain style on you, play as you wish (I like taking this game chill, but hardcore is out there for people who want to, you can set your own goals). 
- Progression feels natural and rewarding, because the quality of life in-game improves along the items you automate. For example, after my first 5 hours I thought it would be perfectly fine to just handcraft storage-boxes without automating them (not too big a deal, right?), until I had some resources left and decided to automate them; and boom I've now created a complete mall where I can easily pick up all other world items from the storage boxes I've created. Point is: I never realized how much I needed to automate them until I did. The game's design is smart like that. 
- The sense of scale is well done. From realizing you have an entire planet, to realizing you have an entire solar system, to realizing you have an entire star cluster to explore is a true inspiration that can let your mind wonder on all the possibilities you have for building. 
- So far the amount of bugs is very minimal. The optimization of the game is very well done. Runs smooth as butter. 

Cons:
- After your factories get bigger and bigger, more cpu memory is required. My first planet is now almost completely covered in buildings, and sometimes I experience frame-rate drops (although it's still stable between 45 and 60 fps, and I'm working with i5).
-  The tutorial/in-game guide is not really helpful. It tells you how mechanics work, but doesn't tell you anything about efficiency. Some youtube tutorials might be required. I threw away my first playthrough after realizing I made a complete mess and had to organize everything on a different scale, after being already 10 hours in. Not necessarily a complaint, as the game doesn't do any hand-holding, but if you're a noob to automation games like me, sometimes you might get stuck and it might be better to complete start over, rather then re-organizing everything. This can be a bummer :p
- The game can get a bit repetitive at the start, when you're automating all your basic materials. It's not too grindy if you automate things, but building your first factories can be a bit tedious. 
- Building a dyson sphere can take quite long (I'm 37 hours in and I'm only halfway through the ability-tree). Prepare to sink time into this game. 

In  other words; much more pros than cons. A cool automation game for both veterans and noobs of the genre, with a beautiful aesthetic, soundtrack, and general fun times. Highly recommend it to anyone who either likes games about space, or crafting games. Definitely worth it's price! 9/10",1685284866,1685284866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

""Awesome, cocaine like gameplay loop for the first 20 hours, then I realise that I am on a boooring sure track to victory, it was only a question of time."" Was my first gripe. It's not so boring anymore, even without the coming alien threat. Although some problems remain...

1) (FIXED)""The game needs challenge, be it enviromental hazards, aliens or something else. Something to keep me on my toes. Even a growing human population to keep hooked up to energy, so that I actually had an earlier incentive to start with the Dyson Sphere Itself."" I can now challenge myself with minimal resources and have to think efficiency in everything I do. Well that's how I feel atleast on current playthrough.

2) (FIXED) ""I started the game with 0,8x resources, and boy do they seem plenty! So plenty in fact, that I doubt beginning a new game with 0,5x could sort this problem. Starting planet could easily do with 0,2x resources. Make resource rich planets small, add different basic resources so that they could be dispersed on different planets."" Minimal resource option seems like a good thing, but we still need more basic resources.

3) ""I don't get solar sail lifetime. I suppose this is the only difficulty inducing element in the game, and it is nonsense. And it is not even actually difficulty, it just adds tedium, in that no small factory can accomplish the program. So the game forces to go big, but only for the sake of going big."" I guess this is still there, but oh well...

4) Awful English. Although it probably kinda makes sense, I wouldn't understand anything in a real Dyson Sphere Program either.

5) Other solar systems too late in the game: Warp drives are at the very end of tech tree. I didn't actually ever get to interstellar travel, although I dont see I would never had needed to get to another solar system to finish the game, as all the resources are present in starting system.

TLDR:
While still having problems, the game has benefited from many changes and my review goes from negative to hopeful positive.",1612455456,1684834271,True,0,0,0.527636289596557617,0,True,False,True

It feels like a combination of factorio and planetary annihilation (without the... planetary annihilation part) where you slowly build up a factory on your starting planet, extracting and converting resources into usable products, and expanding outwards to other planets, obtaining new and rare resources and further expanding into other star systems in your local part of the galaxy. All to create dyson spheres around your stars which power your planet-sized factories to... make more stuff and add to the galactic power generation! Yes, this has some aspects of multiplayer where you are contributing to a global power generation with others who are also creating dyson spheres. There is also a multiplayer mod on Overwolf (a third-party application) which allows you to play in the same session with your friends if you want to play that way. There's also some form of player customisation which is mostly aesthetic but also contributes to your mech's combat power (more on that below) which requires certain resources to ceate, based on what you want to apply to your mech. There are blueprints for different designs which you can create and share with others too.

It's pointless to explain every aspect of this game because you just have to play it to understand and there's a lot to explain. It has a lot of QoL features compared to factorio and other similar games and it has been getting consistent updates since its initial Early Access release on steam. They are also planning on adding combat to the game, which is thankfully opt-in (because I already stress myself out enough with trying to get factories and ratios right, I don't want to worry about killing aliens too!) and your combat ability will likely be directly tied to how you apply different parts to your mech.

There are a few things which contribute to poor performance but those are being ironed out by the dev team and you can even dynamically change some settings like logical calculations vs. graphical calculations to balance things out.

That is, if you do manage to remap the controls, the game will overwrite your edits at the next launch.  This goes beyond not supporting control rebinding and actively works against it.

I'm a programmer and I've worked in software engineering environments.  I get that you have to prioritize what to work on.  I can understand that having most keys rebindable is enough for most people, even if it is very frustrating to those of us who really need the remaining keys to be configurable.  The problem is that this took *extra, deliberate work* to make it harder for us to work around the problem.

Normally I keep an eye on the games for which I've left a negative review and if they fix the issues, then I'll revise/remove the review.  However, this speaks to an attitude on the part of the devs that seems (to me) to be actively hostile towards those who just want to rebind controls.  I'm not sure that fixing the rebindings will be a convincing reason to change this review from negative at this point.

Having said all that, the reason why I'm so irritated about the keybindings being incomplete in this game is that I really want to play it and I've really wanted to play it for a long time.

ORIGINAL: I don't recommend the game at this time because some controls are still hardcoded.  This is a PC game and I want to be able to change how I control it.

I look forward to playing DSP and updating this review once the issue is resolved.

I'm aware that this is early access, but most keys and functions have been remappable for over a year.  It's a combination of a key I want to remap and a function that I want to remap both being hardcoded that I object to here.

[b]Some things are better than (unmodded or SE-only) Factorio:[/b]

Actual in-engine 3D space. Planets are spheres and have real orbits. For some buildings, it matters where you build them (on the equator, poles, etc.).
You get to design your Dyson Sphere and it being larger or smaller than a planet's orbit has real consequences. There's a clean and natural progression of walking->flying->interplanetary->interstellar.

Because this is done natively by the game, you also get fully-fleshed out interstellar logistics out of the box.

You start with a personal roboport.

You can copy a building with its ""inserter"" (sorter) setup on it. This makes it super convenient to build assembly lines.

[b]Some[/b] buildings are stackable. This is a much nicer way of ""upgrading"" them than crafting them into mk2, mk3, etc. (and looks cool, especially labs). On the other hand, a lot of them aren't. Unstackable assemblers are a missed opportunity, but on the other hand stackable containers are not really needed for anything yet they exist.

The buildings are more varied in shape and have ""connection points"" that limit where you can place ""inserters"" (sorters). This is not as artificial or annoying as Big Pharma, but it will provide a little variety in your designs (very little - assemblers are fully connected on all 4 sides).

There's a building that's an [spoiler]entire mining outpost with its built-in roboport[/spoiler]. That makes [spoiler]expanding to new ore patches[/spoiler] a lot quicker and more convenient. [spoiler]You can even have it drain unreasonable power to make it mine faster to get rid of those last few nodes in an ore patch.[/spoiler] Nice.

There's some kind of a New Game+ (metadata) where you can early-unlock some sciences with points gained from your earlier playthroughs. I'm not there yet but I imagine it would help skip some early-game unlocks that would be annoying to get to normally when you've completed the game multiple times already.

No horrible UPS-destroyer fluid and pipe mechanics! Fluids and gases are items that can go into a special high-capacity tank and otherwise belted normally.

[b]Some things are different but I wouldn't consider them better or worse:[/b]

Belts are trivial compared to Factorio. 3D means you can always get from point A to point B by going above/under/between things. Belts do not have near/far sides, and there's a built-in item stacker, making sure you'll never need more than one belt for anything, even at endgame throughput. There's a built-in universal throughput-unlimited balancer item for up to 4 belts that also acts as a loader from/to chests (something the game never told me, only the patch notes! You build a chest on top of a splitter).

The scale you're building things at is much smaller than Factorio. This doesn't take away from enjoyment, but it does make things lean a little more towards casual play. Having [spoiler]6-8 of most[/spoiler] buildings with only a few exceptions will comfortably get you to endgame. The crafting chain you need to win is also simpler than Factorio's (and in a different realm if you compare it against SE, but this is a good thing).

Flying-robot logistics are nerfed compared to Factorio, but at the same time have three different tiers that don't obsolete the others and you'll be using together.

Landfill (foundation) mechanics work like Cities: Skylines for some reason: you need to take away high ground somewhere before you can plug puddles and lakes to build on them.

There's no combat. The devs have stated that this is the #1 item on the roadmap, but I don't feel that the game is somehow incomplete without it. There will be a peaceful mode so all players will be able to pick their preferred game mode.

The blueprint system is worse, but I don't consider this a negative, because due to the smaller scale and trivial belt mechanics you simply don't need them as much. In Factorio, I have multiple blueprint books ready to go, some of them containing even more books. Here, I copypasted [i]some[/i] smelting and assembly lines to widen them a few times. It was definitely worse but not enough to be an annoyance.

[spoiler]""Modules"" go on your items and you have to keep making them. This adds a little extra production to counteract what's missing compared to Factorio. Speed and production modules are one and the same (proliferators) and efficiency modules don't exist because why would you ever use them?[/spoiler]

[b]Where DSP is definitely worse:[/b]

Combinators are completely missing, and there are some in-game recipes that really want you to use them. As an example, [spoiler]one of the outputs of oil processing is hydrogen, and there's a secondary process to enrich hydrogen. You can't run it always or you'll have too much, but you have to run it or you won't have enough. You can work around this problem in multiple ways, but all of them are silly and require you to build far more elaborate designs than you would otherwise need[/spoiler]. Even the most basic automation (if there are >X things in that container, stop this belt) would provide enough functionality to solve this properly.
The closest thing you get is a belt throughput measuring device that can alert you but not do anything else. It's useless.

Actually designing your Dyson Sphere is a chore and not explained well. There are premade blueprints on the internet that you can paste in to skip this, but some UI work (let me build a closed polygon in one step and repeat it!) could make this less annoying. There are mods aiming to improve this in particular.

Speaking of the UI, this is one of the most common complaints in other reviews that I can see along with the controls. While it's worse than Factorio's, no contest, it's also not that big of a deal because you need to interact with it way less due to the smaller scale of everything. I only found interfaces related to Dyson spheres to be annoying (including the basic [spoiler]rail ejector[/spoiler], and those are a small part of the entire game despite its title.

Still UI: the tech tree is bad to navigate. Some pieces of tech need another to be researched first that's not visually connected to unlock, and there's no search function to find the thing. Furthermore, there are two tech trees on two separate pages.

The localization is bad. Things are often in broken English or rarely, Chinese. For Early Access, this is OK. The lines are understandable enough, but weird and unnatural. The Chinese fragments are rare and minor, understanding them is not required.

The modding community is a lot weaker than Factorio's. This is not directly the devs' fault, but the game is apparently more difficult to mod than Factorio, which plays a part. Mods are mainly QoL. There are no significant conversion mods like Bob's/Angel's, which is a huge blow to replayability.

The game sometimes decides to randomly quit. This seems to be common enough that it's handled - next time you start you'll get a warning that you might want to load an earlier save in case the latest is corrupt. I'd suggest reducing the autosave interval to at most 5 minutes, and manually saving whenever you finish building or upgrading a block.

This is not a comparison to Factorio, but I'll still complain about it. I had an absolutely beautiful scene of my moon's planet moving in front of its sun, and was eagerly awaiting the ensuing eclipse... that never happened. I got magic sunlight instead. Eclipses are a missed opportunity for free advertising, that would've been a YouTube-worthy ""so cool"" moment.",1683034906,1683035235,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,True

Good things I liked about DSP:

Amazing gameplay: The game starts easy and gets harder as you go, so it's good if you like games that challenge you.

Pretty graphics: The game looks really nice with lots of bright colors and cool designs for a game in early access. 

A fun story: The story is about humans exploring space, and it's interesting to see what happens next.

Sandbox mode: You can build and test with different things in sandbox mode without any rules holding you back.

Lots of ways to customize your gameplay: You can make your structures and ships look how you want them to, which is cool, you can also design your own mech which I find cool as well

Some Minor things I dislikes about DSP:

Difficult to learn at first: The game can be confusing at first, so it takes time to get used to.

Lots of micromanagement: You have to keep track of a lot of things in the game, which can be overwhelming.

Can be repetitive: The game is about gathering energy, so it can start to feel the same after a while.

Overall, it offers a unique and satisfying gaming experience. With its sandbox mode and extensive customization options, players can create their own unique gameplay experience and explore the vast expanse of the galaxy.

When I initially picked up this game, it really didn't hit off for me. I definitely had a preference for Factorio. I came back to it once or twice, with about similar results occurring the next two times. The 4th time however, something about the game just clicked; it became an incredibly complex game of ambition for me.

When you start off, the game feels quite slow and repetitive, very much like early game in Factorio. Eventually however, you get to a point where you're starting to enjoy creating new designs for your factories, starting to utilize blueprints on unprecedented scales. Something about transporting items from planet A to B becomes intensely satisfying, and your endless want to complete a Dyson Sphere starts to become an endless ambition. It starts with one simple Dyson Sphere. But why not utilize all the layers? You then build out all the other layers, despite one layer being more than enough. Then you turn your eyes to other stars. It starts to become an all consuming ambition that extends itself more and more, with your gathering of resources becoming more frantic and your transport networks becoming quite intricate. Where you once built everything on a single planet, single planets start getting dedicated to single resources; entire systems get dedicated as transport hubs, dyson construction sites, or energy collection for your other planets. It becomes a well oiled machine, one that once fueled the construction of a singular Dyson Sphere now extending to build multiple at once.

So far this looks very solid. It's a blend of Factorio and Satisfactory. Its easy to see the influence of both. The difference here is the scale of it all. Imagine your Factorio factory linked to space shipping lanes to supply and drive a whole universe!! The scale is awesome and a bit scary to be honest.

The graphics look very nice up close though, like Factorio, being zoomed in close is an early game thing. Later you will be looking at planets in the way you used to view a basic mining/smelting setup.

For early access, this has a very polished feel. The English translation is actually pretty good as well. 

I plan to update this review as I delve deeper, but from what I have seen of game play videos and my experience in the game, this is an EASY game to recommend.

In Dyson Sphere program, it is assumed that the interstellar market is nonexistent and that energy production and resource acquisition are the main objectives of civilization. I personally love this format, as it allows you to focus on industry without the need for negotiation or item valuation. If you are enamored with the idea of a Dyson Sphere (The hypothetical megastructure that captures the solar energy of the sun) or even exponential industrial growth (Which the game does beautifully via blueprints that promote GSRF(Guided self-replicating factory) creation), this is literally the perfect game for you. factorio has character and battle limitations, and Satisfactory has no way of building machines with other machines. I enjoy all three of these games, but this game is undoubtedly the most industry-focused and therefore my favorite. in short: if you liked the industrialization in Factorio and Satisfactory, but didn't like the economy or difficulty, play this one!

 Also, variety of gravitational feel on the surface of differently sized (or masses) planets would be a nice addition.

But the developers seem more interested in new features instead QOL or consistency. Nevertheless they did a fantastic job to this point and I have faith in them to fix all the little annoying things.

Maybe the devs want to add a full game experience beside building a dyson sphere (I am talking about the upcoming patch with the dark fog or something like that???) and then fix all the little things?!?

I've really enjoyed it so far, I mean this first run through took me 120 hours of Gameplay plus YouTube videos plus blueprint hunting. 



Some suggestions:
 
There really should be a small amount of blueprints in the game.

The tutorial should also be reworked because there are a lot of blind spots where I didn't know what to do or how or why.

There should also be a consistency on how the belt works with the different buildings. Sometimes you have to connect it directly to the building, sometimes you have to use an inserter, sometimes the belt goes through the building. I'm talking about missile silos or artificial stars or rail ejectors, ray receivers, splitters, automatic piler (should be renamed), tanks, and so on and so forth.

I get it for the construction part e.g. Assembling Machine but for the majority of the other buildings it feels like just stupid (Ray Receiver have an in and output ""door"" for the belt, this should be on all buildings like rail ejectors, rocket silos, artifical star etc.) Setting up such thing would be much easier if you don't have to use an inserter, an the mentioned building even look like they meant to have an belt input instead of an inserter.

The hole dyson sphere, swarm, mecha look system is terribly overly complex. They need a rework, specially for the mecha look and the dyson sphere editor.

I don't like how the foundations work and that you always have too few or none at all.

Inventory and logistic screen needs a little love as well. Items stored in the logistic row don't count for building which means the game thinks you are out of specific item when building even though you have enough in the logistic row. But that is most likely a bug.
Also, more automation regarding crap and auto sorter inventory.

Upgradeable PLS to ILS. ILS Stations need also some love, that's not perfect for how they work at the moment. I would like to determine where I get the resources from or where they should go. Also include logistic bots, many of them and make them faster.

Tanks or storage should be set to let items disappear in the void, if needed. Looking at you hydrogen :D

Oh and navigation is horrible. I'd like some improvements like locking the north when opening the map (M & V) and navigating, there seem to be a button top right but this doesn't work at all nor does it seems to do anything. You really get lost on your planet, plus the other planets in you starter system. I'm not even talking about the mess with other clusters/star systems. We really need some sort of system to not get lost. A good start would be some (on and off switchable) Signs in Map Mode for everything you like to add a sign to. For example I automate assembling belts and building, let me put a Sign on there so I know where to find stuff when flying around. Also in V Mode, Signs for Clusters or Planets maybe with text for you to find stuff you set up 10h ago...

There are a lot of thing I can't remember right now but there are a lot of cool people with suggestions on the reddit sub.",1680962640,1680962815,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

- The game has you looking at spheres (i.e. at least half of your planet is always out of sight) without providing you great organisational tools to manage it. Combine that with lackluster visuals (compare this to factory which put lots of effort in letting you know if you're looking at a smelter or oil refinery or nuclear centrifuge) and you'll have lots manual searching and a general feeling of disconnect to your factory.
- The tech tree is all over the place and unnecessarily detailed. You'll often end up unlocking buildings or products where you'll still need to unlock the raw materials.

One of the game's standout features is its deep and complex resource management system. Players must harvest resources from planets, asteroids, and stars to build a Dyson Sphere, a massive structure that harnesses the power of a star to provide energy to their civilization. The game's resource management system is both challenging and rewarding, requiring players to carefully balance their resources and make strategic decisions to ensure the survival and growth of their civilization.

The game's graphics are also a major highlight, with beautiful, detailed worlds and stunning space vistas that are truly breathtaking. The attention to detail in the game's art design is impressive, and each planet and star system feels unique and full of surprises.

Another standout feature of Dyson Sphere Program is its deep tech tree, which offers a wide range of upgrades and research options for players to unlock. The game's research system is well-balanced and rewarding, giving players a sense of progression as they unlock new technologies and expand their civilization's capabilities.

The game's automation and logistics systems are also incredibly satisfying to use, allowing players to create complex supply chains and automated factories that run like clockwork. Seeing your factories and logistics systems in action is a sight to behold, and the game's user-friendly interface makes it easy to create and manage these systems.

Overall, Dyson Sphere Program is a truly outstanding game that offers a unique and immersive gameplay experience. Its deep and complex resource management systems, stunning graphics, and well-balanced tech tree make it a must-play for fans of strategy and simulation games. If you're looking for a game that will challenge you and keep you engaged for hours on end, look no further than Dyson Sphere Program.",1611575834,1680101267,True,0,0,0.475392341613769531,0,True,False,True

It really changes your perspective when you upgrade your tech and see something what was once inaccessible, becomes within reach and even some time after that, you don't even notice how you struggled for it, while you try to expand your base to reach even further.
I love the scalability of that, where you can manage your factory on every level- starting from choosing your transport belts location, through moving resources across planets, and to hauling everything from all corners of your cluster to build your own sphere.
Technically its also well done and can run on modern potato-end computers.

With the ability to travel through multiple solar systems, you can create more than one Dyson Sphere, and the scale of this game is truly awe-inspiring.

Moreover, the developer has announced that a combat system is on the way, and players can choose to play with or without enemies, depending on their preference. This adds another exciting dimension to the game, and I can't wait to try it out!

I've been been on space games since StarCraft late 90s version.

Love it to this very moment, but something's was still missing for me. Not taking anything from it, however not being about to go on a full planet had me thinking what if?

So in my related section DSP was there. I bought it and tried it. 

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! TO THE FACT THAT IT'S SOUNDTRACK CAN LIVE IN MY HEAD FOREVER. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TECH TREE IS SO ENJOYABLE, I SAID ILL PLAY AND FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT AND IT'S A BLAST DOING SO.

The start felt similar. I built my belts, factories and I was the best italian chef on the planet. Research was going well and the new technologies were comming faster than I could process them. Then I reached a point where the game told me : To continue you have to get the resource from another planet because the starting one does not have it.

That took, if I may say, a stellar turn.

Then I had to visit another planet, started to mine ores and bringing them manually back. I looked for a automatic solution because those trips were nice but my inventory capacity was not enough. Then I implemented interplanet transportation. I felt like I am participating in Civilization Beyond Earth intro movie. It felt like a new civilisation was born and now lives amoung starts.

Pros:

 [b] 1. The Graphics [/b]

SPACE!!!!! ^_^
That said, the thing that has impressed me the most about DSP is how beautiful the graphics are. Sometimes I'll hop on just to fly around and look at the views.

 [b] 2. Tech Tree [/b]

The Tech tree as you progress into the game shows all the progressive unlocks as you work towards your goal of building the dyson sphere and strip mining the galaxy! As someone who loves the feeling of progression and knowing what is required for each step along the way, the tech tree is implemented well!



 [b] 3. Small Dev Team [/b]
The dev team is fairly small and significant updates are few and relatively  far between in early access, yet  the dev team always delivers quality updates that are enjoyable & that are fairly bug free. They also care about their fan-base and they are great about not only communicating about the game, but letting us in on fun little things from their personal lives!

Cons:

[b] 1. No multiplayer [/b]

[b] 2. The tutorial  [/b] 

The tutorial (mostly just tips here and there as you play), while semi helpful feels very incomplete and is a bit of a barrier to players brand new to the genre. Love the assistant's voice though!


 Overall, with the upcoming release this year of combat into DSP, I would 10/10 recommend this game for anyone who loves the genre!",1677873195,1677873195,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It keeps you busy until late game. Once you've reached the point where you are constructing the Dyson Sphere, the only thing it has going for it is watching the Dyson sphere being constructed.

It works fairly well till late game at which point some players are seeing things that don't sync with other players.
     Biggest problem. Mid to late game fps is terrible. You'll notice with an overlay that fps is at 20ish but your cpu and gpu are not being utilized above 50%. Well that's the case with my 7950 and 4090. The game desperately needs optimized. I cannot overstate this. The framerate is the biggest cause to start a new game or just play something else.

Dyson Sphere Project is okay. It's not as complex or exciting as Factorio, but it's pretty and has some cool space stuff going on. It's a laid-back experience, I guess.

Honestly, I think the reason Factorio dumped me was because I couldn't perform... when it came to designing circuit networks. I kept getting tripped up on builds, and I think it frustrated the game. It's hard, you know?

While it's often compared to Factorio, a gold standard in the factory line game genre, Dyson Sphere Project fails to meet even the basic expectations of a good game.

One of the biggest issues with Dyson Sphere Project is the lack of long-term objectives. Unlike Factorio, where the end goal is clear and drives the gameplay, Dyson Sphere Project leaves players without a clear sense of purpose beyond building and researching for the sake of it. Even if the goal is to provide power to your planet, you can do so with burning wood from trees. Without any explorative end goals, scores to meet, or places to go, there's no real point to the whole game.

Additionally, the lack of challenges to overcome makes Dyson Sphere Project a one-sided and ultimately boring game. In any good game, players need to face obstacles and overcome them through gameplay. However, in Dyson Sphere Project, there are no real challenges to overcome, making the gameplay feel pointless.

Overall, I don't recommend Dyson Sphere Project to anyone looking for an engaging and satisfying gaming experience. While it may look and sound like a good factory line game, the lack of purpose and challenges ultimately make it a disappointing experience. Save your time and money and look for a better game.

This game has scalability, optimization and user created content like no other game I've seen. 

The game starts out small enough for you to handle. If you're like me, the science runs in the background during workdays when I can only concentrate on the game max 10% of the time, you don't even have to expand beyond a single (top-offed) matrix until the late game when it's exactly the kind of challenge you would like. 

This is clearly a work of passion: It feels like a finished game already and they're still in early access adding more significant content. I gotta admit I despise early access as an idea but these kinds of games (Satisfactory included) raise my optimism toward the concept. I'm happy to give the developer my money to support their goals. 

There are a few minor translation problems (f. ex. at the moment hovering over Life Distribution of Solar Sails in Dyson Sphere view shows Chinese letters but I've managed to survive without the translation. I'm sure an optimization engineer could tell you what it means since they're trying to draw every last drop of any resources you have but I'm an infinite resources pleb and just shrug at the lost information. Ah, and if you don't like figuring everything out by the badly translated tutorial, there are a lot of helpful tutorial videos on the internet. 

Some weird button combinations exist where delete does a certain thing when it doesn't any other time and right click is *very* flexible on when it does what depending what interface you have open. It takes some getting used to but in the end you never manage to do anything irreversible by accident. 

This positive review was brought to you by getting to put the third input into a weirdly placed advanced mining machine after building the two other ones. It wasn't possible before but the devs managed to make it possible anyway. Thank you for that! You seem to know what you're doing.

Pros:

Beautiful scenery

great randomization of planets and stars

Great replay-ability with the new research carryover 

Cons:

the tutorial is pretty much junk

uses for items need a better breakdown, especially for rare items. The only way to tell what they are used for is the wiki or going through every other material to see what they are used for. I should be able to mouse over each rare item and see exactly what I can use it for

the mini drones for transporting goods to you should be able to be added to all the logistics towers so you don't have to attach storage units and dispensers.

The items enhancement sprayers should be trackless to use personal drones and have built-in storage

The upgraded optical miner should be reduced from requiring green research cubes to purple. By that point, I have enough miners out that they almost feel redundant. You should also be able to use the old miners to upgrade to the optical otherwise you are stuck holding onto a ton of them and it feels like a waste of resources.

Strongly, strongly recommend this game. The progression is amazing, the way the game makes you scale everything is so well made and even tho there is an actual limit to the resources you could use to scale, it is basically unreachable. I played this games a few times, completed it fully twice including having 6-7 full dyson shpere in one of the playthru. They even included the ""metadata"" thingy which allow you to bank stuff for a next playthru to skip some of the steps. This even gives you a reason to over-scale even after having completed the game.

One ""cons"" I would say is that the ""Mission complete"" stage is way, way to easy to achieve even on the first attempt. It should ask you for something like a million white cube so you would hit a massive wall and you have to re-think.

I strongly recommend to play at 1x resource and not fall for the ""infinite"" trap as this makes the game actually less enjoyable. Having the resource deplete quickly forces you to be more efficient in scaling up, finding better ressource and explore more planets / system. Once you got a few blue print, you can industrialise an entire planet within minute (and it IS enjoyable).

And the feeling of seeing your first Dyson Sphere being built in real time right around the sun is out of this world. I have a beefy PC and I was actually surprised it could handle everything that was happening when I started the launch sequence for the dyson sphere to be built.

This game is a lot of game for your money.

Strongly recommend, I would place this in my top 2 games of the genre, right above Satisfactory, letting factorio far far behind.",1675995681,1675995681,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Les surfaces de construction sont des sphères et bien qu'il soit possible de construire sur une grille classique tant qu'on ne s'éloigne pas trop de l'équateur, les pôles sont une tout autre histoire et donne l'occasion de construire des motifs circulaires bien différents des classiques vu dans la plupart des jeux de cette catégorie.

Find rare resources to ease production line requirements or be very neat and tidy because you'll need plenty, PLENTY of resources to build your final dyson sphere around the star to collect ridiculous amounts of energy. The addition of the Milky Way lets you compare your output to other players and is nice touch.

1.have a hare time finding a tied locked planet to farm critical photon? build a sphere that covered the inner planet,the whole surface of that planet can produce it
2.every planetary logistics station produce 1 product, get interstellar logistics station in a line ,link them with warper,to do  interstellar transit.
3.every giant planet can put up to 40 orbital collectors 
4.deuterium is much need in late game,make a blue print of fractionator is needed,make sure the line of hydrogen goes back to the same  planetary logistics station.
5 proliferator is excellent every CPU,turbine,plane filter, quantum chip,matrix,rocket,anti matter fuel rod,particle broadband production ine need it as well as your power supply
6.automatic piler straating at end of the productiong line, put the first one in 30/s ,then put another one every 15/s
7.silicon ore is much needed double or triple the production rate.
8.try to build a production line for every building ,especially belt,sorter mk2 ,assembling mechine mk3 smelter,lab,tesla tower.
9 you will need multiple  interstellar logistics station for some raw materials such as silicon ore,hydrogen,spiniform stalagmite crystal, carbon nanotube,deuterium,
10 make sure  every  logistics station charges at full speed,DO NOT put the material mentioned in tip 9  in one  interstellar logistics station,otherwise the vessels are too busy to transfer every materials you need
游戏后期小tips：
1：还在为好不容易找一个潮汐锁定的星球铺满射线接收器结果产出的临界光子还不够用发愁？其实只要你的戴森球够大，把本星系里最里面的那颗行星包裹进去，那这个行星所有表面都能24小时产出临界光子
2：搭配利用好行星内和星际物流站，建议是找一个纬度铺满一整排星系物流，所有星系物流站之间可以直连跃迁，上下空间放人造恒星，然后每个行星内物流站负责1种产物产出，模块化搭建
3：每个气态行星最多能摆40个采集站
4：重氢到后期即使你把所有气态行星都插满还是不够用的，保存一个上百个分馏器的重氢分馏产出线比粒子对撞省电，但务必要设置回流到出发点+备几幢液体储存罐不然会堵
5：增产器神器，CPU，绿马达，黄马达，白糖，运载火箭，位面滤过器必用 
6：自动堆叠机第一个放在产出刚好满30个每秒的地方，后续的要放15个每秒的地方，电路，电磁铁，金伯利矿，干冰必备
7：硅石缺口较大，建议大型矿机开倍速
8：给每个建筑做一个生产线，如果暂时资源不够，优先熔炉工厂。
9：当一个星球工厂覆盖率高时，有些资源只靠一个星际物流站是来不及运输的，典型石笋，单磁，重氢，各种矿石
10：限制星际物流站运力的一个电力一个飞船数，电力能拉满都拉满，然后5个选项里要注意合理搭配，一般是建筑配高消耗性材料。低消耗材料放一起。不然会有的忙死永远0/10，隔壁那个却空闲天天10/10",1674185068,1675495795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The development team has their priorities incredibly misaligned with the needs of  the game.  The developers have stated their number one priority for 2023 is to add combat to the game.

I reached a point where I wanted to build my first Dyson Sphere in a cluster I was excited to use as a location for several spheres.  Even in planning mode, a single-layer moderately-sized sphere killed the FPS on my machine (the game went from 60 FPS to 14 FPS).  I had not created one element of the sphere, I had simply created the plan for it in planning mode.  My video card is an RTX 2080 Ti.

The Performance Test view showed the ""Draw Call"" method had gone from a 1 ms call to a 12+ ms call, simply by planning the sphere around one star, without even building one element of the sphere, no sails, no nodes, no structure.  Clearly, the existing tools show the developers where to focus their attention to fix this problem.

For the gamer, the only way to make the FPS return to a playable state is either delete the plan for the sphere, or turn off the display of the sphere entirely (after creating the layer plan, you need to disable both Display settings, removing the checks in the tick boxes, in editor, and in game).

Many players have complained about the FPS-killing nature of the spheres, so it wasn't hard to find an article mentioning turning off the display of the spheres.  I think it is preposterous that the development team for a game called Dyson Sphere Program would prioritize combat over fixing the game breaking logic problems related to the eponymous game feature.

I've enjoyed playing the game,  It is a real shame a reasonable video card cannot display a sphere, and one must completely turn off the display of the primary end game feature  to make the game continue to run.

The guids are strange. There are guides for all the easy stuff, but when you get to the complex topics there is no help to be found. 

The end game was pretty disappointing. It feels like there is missing a mining / foundation automation function. You basically just fly around placing interplanetary logistic stations and miners. It's actually pretty boring at this point. 

Maybe I just played it wrong 🤷

Still a great game, but yeah. The end game could use some more work. 

Spoiler: It's also really strange that the game ""completes"" when you have produced and researched 4000 of the white cubes. You can do this without even starting on building your Dyson Sphere. I think they should change this or maybe make another ""research tree tab"" where you track progress on a complete sphere, whith sub-goals etc. That would make the end game much more enjoyable, for me at least.

Edit: After giving the game some more thought, I feel like I lacks purpose. In the beginning you are told humanity lacks energy. But you never end up providing it. You just use it to harvest more resources and devouring more planets. All energy is invested in creating antimatter to further the research, allowing you to be more efficient. But there doesn't seem to be a purpose to any of it. Like ""Congratulations, you a now generating 30GW of energy on this empty cold planet of solitude in a starststem far from any lifeform."" Why would I ever wanna do that? I've actually changed my mind about the game!

It took boredom and $20 out of my pocket to cannon ball into another random game, take a risk with early access, and hope I got something decent here. In short - if you like Factorio, you'll like Dyson Sphere program. Very similar in nature, but differences slice the land when it comes to the experience. U N F O  R T U N A T E L Y, Dyson Sphere Program (at the moment) does not have multiplayer, which made Factorio a unique city-building type experience you could share with a friend. Does the game hold-up without that? For the moment (being gracious of the current game state)... yes. Keep in mind... early access review, review will be updated with time.

The [b]gameplay[/b] intermediately differs from Factorio as we move off a 2D reality and roll into a 3D world... literally. Factiorio had a top-down approach whereas Dyson Sphere Program (DSP) works within a model requiring 3-axis (how'd you pronounce that last word... axeees, or ax-sis :). I'll be honest, the ability to run between planets is enticing and the ability to fly gives DSP the new feel that the player isn't replaying Factorio. Being able to stack buildings with familiar settings doesn't make the game feel completely alien, but starting fresh is always a challenge. Strategies change as conveyor belts are narrower (1 item at a time) and the strategies start changing when conveyors can also be built vertically. That's just the start; when the player starts thinking about going to other planets, there is a decent amount of planning that can go into a move like that. Fuel is the first concern, gaining resources by building the base at home is another. I should point out the liquid system isn't quite in effect yet and the devs seem to be using the conveyors as a solution method for the moment... which is kind of nice because it simplifies things. Maybe keep it as an ""new map"" option feature/edit? 

Hours in, I really like the concept of linking planets together. This is Factorio on a bigger scale, and a lot friendlier. The ability to fly, right click to move, and drones to reach nearby construction make the game a little more fluid than its predecessor. Factorio had more of a grind where I feel this is a little more easy with its approach. I feel like repetitive (or annoying) motions that the player has to constantly go through has been avoided through the use of blue prints and other little neat features. Exploring space is quite the trait this game offers. Gas giants, Dyson Spheres, travelling to different planets, systems... it's pretty cool. I hope as the game progresses that useful features will continue to be added (and not just new stuff to have new stuff - gameplay/interaction is always nice)! I wish there was a feature where civilian sustainability could be introduced, would add an extra layer of balance. I like the little additions such as being able to customise armour and animations when the player is idle, shows the little detailed touch.

I feel DSP continues with its user friendliness in all aspects. Besides one little early access glitch (not displaying the proper item for fuel - mini fusion reactor for power), everything is explained well enough that the player can understand what they need to assemble an item. Maybe because this game is focused more with ships, it seems a lot easier to transport items within arms reach. Additionally, players can use drones to restock their items instead of manually restocking. This might seem like a tiny detail, but goes a long way when it comes to saving time. I really wish I used this feature a lot earlier in the game instead of travelling star to star to get what I need. The other massive detail is the current galaxy the player is in; zoom out and an entire giant new cluster of stars (literally everywhere) appears. It's crazy to think the player can literally go and travel to anywhere - and get lost if they don't label systems properly! This game is an automator's dream; everything can be automated! Storing buildings, supplies, ships, fuel, and all sorts of other things can be done almost automatically (and a lot easier with a set of blueprints to rinse and repeat build styles). 

The [b]graphics and visuals[/b] are pretty good and suitable for the game's atmosphere. It's sort of cartoon-ey, but not to the point where it is annoyingly cartoon-ey. Planets have a different feel (hope more atmospheres and environments to come!), the topography is noticeable from certain camera angles, the user interface is nice on the eyes, and the space environment is pretty cool. The only issue with the space visuals is that it can get a little empty flying between planets. I do realise that last statement may be a little contradicting as space is empty, but since this is a game why not pretty it up? The user interface is also awesome and very straight forward. I really liked the variety of camera and map viewing abilities to get a better view on things. There is an option to increase the size of the UI. The [b]sounds and music[/b] are at best okay. I wish games would take more of a risk and try to make it sound like some of those buildings may have people working or making noise in them (think Warcraft 2 / Knights and Merchants). This game has the potential to add a little grit and play with the players emotion. You're kind of a robot mech thing all by yourself, alone in a system about to get some huge industry going... that's a big deal! Make it sound like a big deal! 

Overall, the game is pretty good but certainly needs to continue growing. I think the multiplayer option should be high up on that to-do list in conjunction with adding more to the game. I think there are enough resources to keep the player happy, I also think adding some challenge or variables to the game can really take it to the next level. I think being able to ""stamp"" or label certain areas of a planet would also be a neat feature (and maybe somehow more hover pop-up menus to indicate the production/power/etc... of the planet). Another neat addition I think would be to introduce civilian life. Production to maintain civilian life and perhaps down the line adding policies that can dictate planets. Grow food, terraform,  perhaps with mods defend? But hey - that's my opinion to the Devs! I would recommend a purchase on sale if you're really curious, I would also recommend waiting to see what the final product looks like. I am willing to give this game a bump up to a 8.5 if multiplayer gets included!

The fact that everything is so incredibly finite makes what could have been a relaxing experience a constant fear of your factories shutting down because you cant find the resources anymore. Maybe it is possible to add a feature that makes resources infinite? And no not sandbox mode, I just want the regular experience but my resources dont run out. To make it more balanced maybe make the nodes smaller so they give less output.

Another thing I absolutely HATED was the fact that the mining speed of a miner is dependent on how many nodes its attached to. In principle this isnt such a bad idea but in practice it works out a lot different. If you wish to calculate exact amounts of usage and production (which in my opinion is a big part of the enjoyment in games like satisfactory or factorio) you have to keep in mind that the resource node gives much less output then what you may think. If your miner gives 180 p/m base your factory around 90 p/m because as soon as one node runs out the miner starts mining slower. This broke all of my factories while playing and it frustrated me a lot. A way to fix this would be that the miner mines the ores at a constant rate no matter how many nodes its attached to.

Only issue is some UI elements could be a bit clearer.
For example if a tech tree requires something else it would be nice if the ""requires X"" could be selected to take you to the tech that is required rather than searching for it manually. The tutorial part could be a bit more robust and some of the localisation could be slightly better. Those are just some minor nitpicks though.

This game is addictive. It's probably my favourite of the automation/base building genre. Mostly because you have a change in scenery when you start conquering new planets, so you aren't stuck looking at (or cleaning up) the same mess you started with for the rest of the game lol. Also, Dyson spheres are awesome, and it's what made me want to try the game in the first place.

I really like being able to fly around to other planets and solar systems, spreading and setting up bases to make an interstellar network. The movement and flight feel great. The skill tree progression feels rewarding and impactful. The interplanetary logistics system works pretty well, although I haven't stressed it too bad, but everything works as I want it to right now with about 3 planets. The scale you can eventually build at is enormous once you have the resources of multiple planets to work with. I guess it has to be, to be able to build a Dyson sphere. 

It's been a long time since I've been so engaged in a game. I should probably save this one for weekends only so I don't suddenly realise I have to be at work in a few hours on a weeknight.

And I really thinks that this game do not need it at any kind of. At placing third dimension into developers do their best with gameplay - it's breathtaking and exceting. And gameplay with conquering large part of galaxy is very, very interisting, it easy can take hundreds hours of intense problem-solving actions[/strike]

[b]BUT![/b]
This one is pretty playable and enjoynable right now! Aboard, guys!

[h1]Pretty Playable[/h1]

Firstly, you can now make something like MALL right now without large amounts of planetary/interstellar logistic stations. And also, this is more important, supply yourself by bots. This is really gamechanging innovation, you won't need to build by yourself large amounts of stuff managing parts by hands, you can delegate routine to machines!

Also, I have to check another points like achivements, bugfixes and performance improvement and other, which is really hard (on unity much harder). Blueprints are not carefully and easy done, but they are here and just works. After hours of gameplay I have reached some level of automation and spheres are building itself without large of trivial rounds.

But here are some another issue. [b]Lategame.[/b]

It's boring. Around half of time (total) is aboutt Alt-Tab. And at the lategame it was around 80-90%. I just pasting print on another planet and wait while sphere is building. Easy? Yeah. Interesting. Not so much. There are to little to play around factory designs or productivity. It can be little tuned with cosmetic-elements, but in core solutions there is just two types of - totaly on belts or massive logistic stations. And another point of this is that belts are sucks - you can make modular design very early (and its good) based on flying drones and this would be a painless, although repetative, base operation. At all, after gathering all rare ores and replacing production by alternative recipes there is nothing to done but extend.

I'm not fan of giving treatment to this game, absolutely, however this can make game more intense. Anyway, I think some new techs should be added. Firstly, another options to base layout; it could be anything - from sushibelts, pneumatic mail or train to material -> energy and energy -> material generators. Second, extended logic is musthave, I really want to build self-extending base, but cant be done right now, sadly, in any condition - there is no factorio-like dronestations with building bots: you have to build anything by yourself. Third option - is about travel yourself, it could be lazy teleports or somekind of hyperloops/space-train. And, finally, gameplay should be, imho, extened NOT in managing against threat, but in different layer, maybe space-orbit manipulating, planetary annihilation in order to catch some rarest resource or anything else. And this is very, very weird that in game about space with building dyson sphere everythere (one of the most unbelievable project in the universe) there is no of other spacebuildings, like orbit stations, space elevators or large ships. Just weird.

Last con is controls and readability. This is a little better when early, but still with glitches and unforgivable behaviour. Like you've built large chain of deiterium processing and somewhere chain was disconnected becouse of unstable grid. 95% of causes is about grid. It should be fixed, but this is hardest part connected with begin setup and design. You can't move almost ready square-grid project to hexagonal one. Hardly, but we can fogive this issues, but they are very distractional.

But, as I have said already, the game is pretty good itself right now. Much more. And in my taste dyson sphere program could be much more cool, but this is nerd opinion. Today it could give you incredible puzzle-like gameplay with large sandbox for newbies, much more forgivable gameplay unlike factorio. And sometimes graphics are spectacular.",1624762172,1674755278,True,0,0,0.314750462770462036,4,True,False,True

The 12th Celestial Convergence has begun. In addition to our normal lunar activity we are now facing the threat of a large star system being influenced by the star system we have been training in, in order to come into alignment. I refer to the star system of Earth, the Draco Crater, the Andromeda Galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds. As always I will try to be brief.

This is a warning to our satellites and travelers to be prepared. As it was foretold the Draco Crater, the Andromeda galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds will come together causing destruction and eventually a fusion reaction. This event will be happening in the Draco Crater on August 31st 2017. We are now going to intensify our training in order to reach the other stars before this happens.

Here are the four reasons that we have increased our efforts to get there as quickly as possible:

Guess I've played another 1600 hours since my last review. For my money, this game is the best base builder out there. It is extremely fun and rewarding. Massive replay value.

The developers have done an amazing job pushing updates, especially performance and QoL.  You have to build up to massively overkill scenarios way past endgame before the hardware you are on really matters. The UI is very easy to work with and navigate. Blueprints make life so much easier.

I will say there are a couple obvious achievements lacking, namely:
- Beat the game without building a single warp drive
- Beat the game without building a single logistics tower
- Transport a building to another system on a logistics vessel
- Completely deplete a system of resources (though good luck with Copper)
- Produce at least one item per minute on every planet in the solar system
- Build a Dyson Sphere around ever star in the solar system

The tutorial when first starting a new game nudges you in just the right directions without being overbearing. The game loop of collecting, building, and automating is like crack and keeps you in the zone until you realize the whole day is gone.

Each planet has a finite space and you can circumnavigate them with ease. Logistics are intuitive, powerful and it just works. As you play you progress through local, planetary, interplanetary, and interstellar logistics which has a very satisfying complexity.

What makes this game stand apart from others in the genre is how it *feels* to play. You feel the scale of the planets and the vastness of space. Sometimes it's nice just to kick back and watch and listen as the factory you've assembled hums along, the drones fly by and cargo ships arrive from distant worlds with new resources to feed the beast.

And at the end of it all, you can look up into the sky from your starter world and see your hard work materialize before your eyes. The Dyson Sphere will start to take shape, piece by piece. It becomes more complete and only gets faster as you optimize your factories. It's very rewarding to see!

Just like any Factorio, Satisfactory lover of factory builders out there, I aprechiate quality builds, imaginative solutions and the smell of something cooking that´s good.
On first impression via their trailers, I thought, damm thats way too bright ( my eyes my eyes), yet I was drawn to the promise of a well thought out recipe that allows for interplanetory resource gathering and exploration.  This game might even look and feel like Factoiro, well it should, because it uses the best from that game and even some music choices. It has all those features that might have been missing from that game and yet feels like a very fresh look at the game type.

I can not recomend it more, you do not have to wait long for your science to work it´s magic and you are soon flying. The lights and bright colours make some sense later on when you start to enjoy the effects from far far away in the darkness of space. It´s probably deeper into science than Factorio, so do not feel intimidated by the tech tree for both your bot and your factory.

This is a game about efficiency - shunting loads of materials and objects via conveyor belts through 'factories' created from blueprints you design. 

So why I am not going any further?
 - The design and modification of blueprints is a PITA. If you do it a lot (and you will) in order to try out new layouts and increase your production capacity, you will quickly find the UI tools to manage and update your blueprints a real grind.

- Resources are limited, storage is limited. When you delete a whole swathe of production facilities in order to try a more efficient blueprint, the raw materials, components and facilities themselves are barfed onto the planets surface for you to pickup - and you simply don't have the storage space to hold this stuff. There's no feature/tool/technology that allows you to easily reclaim and recycle it, you're left to simply delete it - loosing all that hard earned production.

- You can build an automated transportation network that spans planets - but you can't see how much stuff you're holding in a remote storage facility. Did I miss researching the Internet?

- You can't prioritise supply chains. Running out of conveyor belts because there's no more Iron to build them! Well at least you have loads of Steel to build Oil Refineries - which need conveyor belts, oops!

In short the game starts out slowly. You build, research and automate. Then as you move off planet you transition into a play style that is about pouring as much raw materials into your production funnel as possible in order to get out what you hope you need in a self sustaining way to fund future R&D and production facilities.

Need more power and mining machines? Then mine more raw materials and build more factories to make more power and mining facilities - why not dial back on my production of Matrix Labs instead and funnel that to my new factories? Well, I have to fly/walk to the facility and manually turn it off of course - and then some other production facilities will grab their share of it.

Let's take a look at our Sun for example, the surface area of the Sun is about 6x10^18 m squared. This means that if we want to build a Dyson Sphere with a thickness of just 1m entirely covering the Sun, we will need 6x10^18 (6 Quintillion) m cubed of materials. For reference the volume Ceres, the Dwarf Planet in the asteroid belt is roughly 0.4x10^18 m cubed. So unless we can find 15 Dwarf Planets made of pure titanium or carbon nano tubes, humanity is still far away from building a Dyson Sphere

In this game the scale is brought down to manageable levels, your local star is no bigger than a planet, and the emptiness of space (especially interstellar space) is remedied by warp travel.

Maybe I'm shallow, but the only reason this game drew my attention at all was because #space. But man, does it work. Unlike others, you get a very significant expansion of scope as your technology and throughput increases. Your not staring at the same map for hours on end - you're building up from a modest corner of the world, to a factory hub, to suddenly making planet-spanning designs, to flinging yourself across the solar system, then between stars. Just like how seeing a smaller setup functioning correctly is satisfying, seeing the space between planets light up with dozens of hundreds of small lights from ships is just as much satisfying, if not more so. There's a real sense of exploration, albeit on the level of Elite Dangerous rather than NMS.

Some of which I see people complaining about 2 years ago, so the devs aren't fixing the most annoying bugs that make the game frustrating. Blueprints are barely useful as they will only work in the same specific spot of a planet. Blueprint a production line, try to copy it just above.. you can't! Proportions aren't the same. And here I'm not taking about the tropic lines which ruin your original designs, make you lose space, and force you to always build everything the same way. So the game is just a repetition of making identical production lines along the horizontal lines in the zone the equator is in. Production lines that were working perfectly well suddenly stop working because all the sorters decide they aren't picking up stuff from the belt for some reason. You delete the machine, copy the one next to it that isn't working either, paste it on the spot of the deleted machine, and it works. This means basically having to delete and remake whole production lines on a regular basis.
It's also very badly optimised. Bad FPS that can't be fixed by changing options. Once you got a significant dyson sphere, don't expect more than 20 fps, unless you disable its display both in the world and in the editor. Once you've maxed out your dyson spheres on a system, you will have 1 FPS if you display them.

The futuristic style of the technology allows you to achieve some pretty impressive feats, and it makes it fun to watch your assembly lines grow with each new piece of technology that you introduce.

I'll start with the basics. The game has a pretty decent starting point. You begin by getting resources and using them to fuel your mech and build up basic technologies to help you automate things. This part of the game is unfortunately the most boring and least exciting part. Your mech is slow, your resource gathering is minimal, and you must undergo the very boring task of manually clicking on resources to harvest them.

Once you pass this point of the game and start upgrading your mech, the game opens up tremendously and allows you to start making some progress and introducing some very fun technology to use to help with logistics, transportation, and more.

 Now, here is the unfortunate thing about DSP:

There is no end goal.

While you have objectives to complete, the game doesn't really ""end"" once you complete the final objective. The only thing that happens is you get an achievement.

For me, I set the goal to build a Dyson Sphere large enough to power my home planet alone. Once that was achieved, I stopped playing, as I felt I had ""beaten the game"" so to speak. While you can decide when you want the game to ""end"", it does lower the replayability for me when there's not really an end goal.

Another issue that this game has is that it is hard to keep track of your production lines. This is a bit of a spoiler here, so skip this paragraph if you want a spoiler-free review. I ran into multiple issues where various planets I travelled to had bottlenecks that happened on them eventually. I had no way of getting notified of these bottlenecks or losses of resources, and it wasn't until I stopped 5-6 steps down the line with my production that I discovered that the resource mining on another planet several light years away had run out. Granted, you could say that this is part of the game, to manage these supply chains, but it turned into a more frustrating part of the game rather than interesting and challenging part. I believe it would be much better if the developers introduced some sort of alerting system that allowed you to know when resources were about to run out on various planets and such. While this would start to clog your UI slightly, they could easily make it a collapsible menu that you can check, with highest priorities first, so on and so forth.

Overall, I think this game is a solid automation game. If you enjoy games like Factorio or Satisfactory, you will definitely enjoy this game.

It took me roughly 80 hours to get to the point where I was able to build my first Dyson Sphere. I'm sure many people have done it faster, but for someone who had never played an Automation game before, I feel this is a fairly average time.

So take that time investment and multiply it out a few times to get roughly the amount you'll need to reach ""end-game"" type stuff. It will take quite a bit of time. However, I had great fun and highly recommend this game to anyone who is up for automation or management games. You'll enjoy the technology, endless amounts of upgrades, and large-scale beauty of the game.",1673386234,1673386234,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

In short, the gameplay's good, the mechanics are fine, but there are a lot of little nuisances strewn all over, a lot of stuff is very unintuitive or downright clunky, and the user interface is downright awful which makes these issues far worse. For the time being, Factorio is simply the vastly better game due to being far more refined.

However... you can still have a lot of fun with Dyson Sphere Program. It's still a good game at its core. Once you learn all the weird, intricate nonsense, it's not that bad, it's just definitely not great of an introduction to your first factory builder genre game, nor is it currently as good as anything else you would play instead.

The thing is, the overwhelming majority of these problems are things that tend to be cleaned up at the very end of a game's development. The tech tree, for example, is an absolute mess. Techs you research don't have prerequisites of required parts, so like you'll learn a new tech, go to build it, and discover you don't have the tech to build it, and the tooltip doesn't tell you where it is, and then you have to go open every single other tech on the tree to figure out where it is looking for it by icon alone only to find it's on the opposite end of the tech tree with no indication the two are linked at all.

To give a more in-depth idea, I recently unlocked the ability to trade between planets. Yay! You kind of need to since not all resources are on all planets.

But yeah, basically needed spots to deliver to, the delivery spots have to have their own bots, have to specify what they're requesting, have to be manually set to actually request anything, and manually set to request instead of sending out by default. That's just for the boxes themselves.

From there, you also have to set up the distribution towers between planets, each planet needs its own tower, the tower needs two kinds of bots, has to be set to request/send locally or interplanetary separately, and though it has bots it can't actually accept stuff directly you have to have a box set up outside and explicitly conveyors going into the tower but not into the box, and for getting things out of the tower there's a special new icon that only shows up if you hover over one of the output slots that aren't very clear they exist and it's not clear that it's needed to do that to get anything out of it.

This gets things onto and off the planets, and into nearby boxes, but you also need planetary scale towers to get the stuff shifted around a planet since the boxes have limited range which isn't shown anywhere as far as I can tell.

I got stuck on almost every single step of all of that, because of misleading, unclear, or just flat out missing tooltips combined with extremely unintuitive methodology. If this were some rare, unnecessary part of the game, it wouldn't matter so much, but this is a pretty fundamental ""you absolutely need to do this to continue"" aspect of the game, and it took over an hour messing around with it after I had all the parts to figure out how they fit together and what setings to set them to in order to get them to work. If it didn't work, there was basically zero feedback other than it still didn't do anything. No indication of what was wrong or what to do to fix it most of the time.

Most of this will probably change by release though. Most of these things are early implementation methods, or things that change often (like the tech tree order and tooltips) so it's not surprising that a lot of this is a mess because it's early access still. The issue is that these things are kind of necessary for basic functionality of the game, and there are a lot of problems with it at the moment. They will probably all be fixed by release as the team's clearly making good updates and fixing things as they go, and much of these issues are things that usually get fixed at the very end of development as stated, but this means that this is a very blatantly early access game.

It has, however, not crashed yet. I had a partial soft lock for a few minutes in the UI once, but was able to fix it without closing the game. The game runs smoothly even on my old junker computer that wasn't fast even when it was new.

Dyson Sphere Program is also fairly pretty, with not too bad graphics at all, though not the prettiest you'll ever see. It's fairly stylized, the buildings make sense looking at them, it visually fits together well, and the music is really nice.

So... if you're bored of factorio or mindustry or any of the others in the genre, DSP is reasonable to pick up. If you're new to the genre... you're vastly better off getting something else for the time being. When it's released fully, DSP will probably be a great game and a top notch contender for second place in the genre, possibly for first place if it can manage a strong modding community with internal support for such combined with multiplayer. If it lacks multiplayer and modding at release, then it will still be behind factorio because of those factors, but it will provide a more pretty visual experience, so some people will prefer it for that.

For the time being... support them with purchase if you want to make sure they have the finances to finish it and polish it up properly, but understand that this is clearly an unfinished game. It's like 90% done or so I'd guess at this point, it ""works"" as in it ""functions at a playable level"" but it's lacking a lot of the really important polish needed for a fun user experience instead of a lot of headaches. Give it another 6-12 months from the date of this review and it'll probably be one of the best options on the market.

I don't regret getting Dyson Sphere Program at all. It's just an extremely hesitant recommendation in the state the user interface is currently in is all, and a few other issues with things like how raising and lowering conveyor belts is a pain to do. Most of this looks like it'll be fixed in the final released version, though. Possibly all of it.",1673128625,1673128625,True,11,1,0.583841383457183838,0,True,False,True

I came back to this after a long break, forgot everything, excitedly started a new game, and it seems updates have just made this more buggy. 
Game continually gives me an alert that it's disabling Steam achievements and segregating me from everyone else (the game pools your data with all other players, so basically you're playing with everyone else, even when you aren't) - I'm just not about that life. This is not China. Do not punish me because of your game bugs. I noticed the Engrish translations have not improved, either.
Sigh. Oh well. Original review is below.

Original review:
I LOVE this game. I HATE this game. I CANT DECIDE. This game is insanity.
I've become demoralized watching videos; after getting to what I thought was the start of endgame only to realize I was near the end of the early game.
I played Factorio. Hated it. Played Satisfactory. Loved it. This is like a love child between the two, but powered to a factor of ten.

PROS:
- BEAUTIFUL game
- You get a MECH! Awesome!
- Automation is super cool to see. It's like, ""I built that plate of spaghetti, and it's ugly, but it's functional.""
- SCIENCE!!!

Cons:
- NO MULTIPLAYER IS A GIANT DRAWBACK
- This is a Chinese game and the translation is so-so. It's clear that English was not the first language of the individual writing the script. On a HIGHLY TECHNICAL game like this, that matters a lot. I found myself getting lost more and more frequently as I unlocked more technology. (This is why I went to search How-To videos and fell down a rabbit hole of hopelessness.)
- The tutorial is about as helpful as someone putting a plate of food in front of you, explaining what the food is, and then expecting you to reproduce it from scratch. It's helpful but it's not as robust as it needs to be.
- The game is massive. That is an understatement. I tell you it's massive and maybe you're excited or maybe you're thinking I'm exaggerating. I am not. It. Is. Massive. (The game world becomes a little smaller as you unlock advanced technologies for quicker travel, but it's still massive.)
- The time sink is real and it's hard to remember what you need to do BECAUSE of how massive it is. You set up Planet A for a specific purpose, go to Planet B, C, D, and/or change stars - you have to automate *entire planets* for specific purpose(s), and then get those planets to automate with other planets. Drones help but this process takes HOURS, and that's *IF* you have made good use of blueprints and shortcuts AND have your automation set up properly. If you are manually setting everything up this becomes an impossible slog. Admittedly your mileage may vary depending on your play style.
- Controls are wonky, and that's being kind. Moving on a planet is intuitive and wonderful. As soon as you take off for flight, things start getting wonky, but it's manageable. However, as soon as you are able to leave a planet, things go downright bonkers. I spent half an hour of my life freaking out as I had freshly unlocked the ability to leave a planet only to realize I had no fuel and the way I left the planet was not the way I would get back to the planet. (I literally got lucky and was forcibly slingshotted around a planet which put me on path back to mine.) It was a mess and I made it back by sheer luck and waiting AGES for my fuel reserves to replenish. (Thanks, Auto-Save, for saving almost immediately after I left the planet....) HIGHLY suggest watching how-to videos for this, if any are present. I'm still afraid to actually leave the planet.

Pros/Cons:
- PHYSICS MATTER. Literally!!! I'm not just talking conveyor belt speeds, I'm talking the angle of certain buildings can't shoot certain sails unless certain conditions are met. If there is a PLANET in the way, it won't fire!!! If the degrees don't match, it won't fire!
- You can spend 15 minutes in this game and make meaningful progress, that doesn't feel meaningful at all. You can spend an hour, two hours, three hours, and have the same effect. It's sheer size and requirement of being a time sink will get you lost in the game if, and only if, you have time to spare but that also means you will spend a lot of time doing a lot of things and feel like you make zero progress for it.

Overall I would recommend playing this game but only to those who have watched one of the endgame videos out there, one of the long 45 minute ones, so you can TRULY appreciate the sheer size of this game, the massive timesink you are looking at, and have an understanding and respect that you will likely NOT know if this game is truly for you or not with an hour or two of playtime under your belt. You will likely spend a good 10-20 hours before you decide if you've got the fortitude to complete this massive game.

This is Industrialization: The Game. I've seen it compared to Factorio, which may be accurate. It's vaguely similar to Oxygen Not Included's automation, and the same in some Minecraft modpacks.

Don't build things personally. This extends to buildings/factories as well -- automate production of those as soon as possible. Conveyor belts are cheap, you can run them across the world pretty easily, spread your stuff out. (Edit to add: And logistics can use drones to ship stuff pretty quickly without the spaghetti at an energy premium.) Some buildings (smelters and assembly buildings, particularly, but research matrices too) need more than one intake from the belt, and/or more than one belt, if you want to maximize production.

Honestly, the factor of not doing things personally makes sense if you consider the scale of what you're trying to build. Of course you're building factories to make factories!

Not doing a review on a very early access game, but I will recommend it for those who like Astroneer, Factorio, Satisfactory and the rest alike. Graphics are nice, able to hit my 4K/120FPS mark with high settings.

The controls definitely need some fine tuning, along with the UI and hotkeys. Its not the easiest to adjust to,  however the utilisation is good, no sudden lag spikes or graphical glitches so far, its a pretty clean early access (clean compared to alot of others..)

One feature I would love to see is the ability to have multi-level structures, meaning either stacking assembling machines, or being able to place a foundation to put one on top of another.

[*]Stunning 65-100 FPS, blowing away many completed titles in any genre
[*]More content by epic levels than most completed games.
[*]Animation and Artwork that surpasses most ""Polished"" games in full release
[*]The score for music and sound is amazing.
[*]Updates regularly without pushing, panicking or raging... they come with ease.
[*]Growth, Development and Replay ability is unsurpassed
[*]Stable is an understatement. It runs amazing... flawless on any graphic setting. If you have issues, it is a driver or something mechanical on the players end. Tested on 4 machine types with various setups, one as old as 17 years, and the game operation was flawless.
[*]Immersive at levels that can not be described. not a full on space junkie, until the last 6 hours played at the time of this review. (YES first time played, never left our seats in 6 hours)
[*]Priced AMAZINGLY low at a mere $1.17US per hour of entertainment! 
[*]On sale would be mind blow of epic levels and unexplained.... but even at full price, just trying to get our understanding of undervalue pricing here. Grab it now!
[*]There is an End Game point, but can be endless if you wish.

The negatives... how forced they must be... but honesty is key...

[*]You must be able to read Chinese or English, they are the only two languages currently
[*]The bad English translation that still exists in areas, funny... but nothing that effects game play or understanding of the task or instructions.
[*]Time can fly by. So immersive can be cataloged as addictive. The visuals alone can move you into a trans.
[*]Single player only at the moment, as multiplayer may come in a long way away down the development highway. 
****So stable in Single player, no need to break it or worry about multiplayer yet. Enjoy the stable, stress free journey at your fingertips.

[*]A beautiful and relaxing ending to each game. Visually stunning. Amazing. Awe inspiring.

Dyson sphere Program® is the most undervalued, and unexpected game of 2021.

Oh, last thought..... let us remind you... since Dyson Sphere Program does play so much better than 90% of any completed titles out there, it is still Early Access.

I've played several similar games, including Factorio and and Satisfactory, and DSP feels better. There's a lot to manage, especially once you advance your tech far enough and get logistics and other planets, but it's rewarding and honestly not tedious.

My advice: don't start playing this on a work night, get familiar with and start using blueprints early, and don't be afraid to get creative and crazy with building.

They have done an amazing job of making several solar systems accessible and interconnectable giving an amazing game even in the Alpha version. The only thing I think that could make this game better would be the option to experience it in VR but this is in Alpha and I believe the dev team is small. They have done amazing and I can't wait to see what they put out next and am certain I will be proven wrong about VR being the only way the game could get better.

You'll see most people say it is intergalactic Factorio\Satisfactory 

But the truth is it is intergalactic Factorio. The satisfactory feeling is from one of two things. It is A) 3D and B) one of the options is to set resource nodes to infinity. Normally they get eaten away like they do in factory and hence the intergalactic part. where you have to go further and further away building logistic chains just for sending warp cores to all your far flung logistics hubs so your long haulers can warp from whatever star system you've gone to this time to get ... and ship it back to your factory on your first or second planet where ever you chose to do so. 

Or you can enable infinity resource nodes, and then it plays more like Satisfactory in that your nodes stay in the same spot and you just build your factory. This is easy mode to learn the game on or if exploring and rebuilding mining posts doesn't interest you. 

now it is <7 days old released in to EA when i write this review. So it is missing 1 major QOL feature (or I just missed it during the tutorial....) is a blue print feature. Because of this I quite building smelters on other planets to cook the ore. I just shipped the ore back to my main planet.

Less power so less time spent setting up a power plant on that planet. and ect. 

Right now at it's current state it does basically everything that Factorio\Satisfactory does and then the extra unique bits that come with space travel.  and it's only come out 7 days ago in to EA on steam. 

Imagine what it could be in 2 yrs.....

I'll update as they do.

Dyson Sphere Program combines so many good aspects of other automation games into one package that it is almost impossible to NOT recommend to fans of the genre or people who are interested in dipping their toes in.
The game starts off slow hand collecting basic materials but within about 10 minutes you are already starting to build facilities to automate those steps.

As the required items become more and more complex they never seem to stray too far outside being manageable. 

There is only one section of the game, progression wise, where players tend to get overwhelmed, Yellow Science, about 10-20 hours into a save for most people. And that is because that is around the time you need to start going interstellar and getting new materials from another planet, something you must do manually for a bit until you can unlock another way to automate even interstellar gathering!

There is so much here that is just fantastic, Dyson Sphere Program builds heavily from and shows it's inspiration from Factorio but never in a bad way. The added 3rd dimension to building, being able to weave belts however you please is a nice change and being able to have an entire planet saved as a blueprint can cut down on tedium later when you are making one material planet wide.

It's worth a play through by anyone who even remotely enjoys  Automation games, especially if you are a Sci-Fi nerd. Combat is coming soon in a patch and the last thing the game needs to truly shine is official multiplayer, although there is a mod that adds that function to the game that is surprisingly stable and works well enough, FOR NOW.

I take back my previous review (striked through above) after playing more of this game. The controls were a bit clunky to get used to and the game seemed way too complex (and it still is after watching loads of videos on it) but once you start wraping your head around using an entire solar system as your playground it makes the game sooo good. Im still barely scratching the surface.

You start with really primitive things, you'll feel like you're progressing really quick through the research system and suddenly you start needing very specific things. So you dedicate an entire side of the planet to making that specific thing only for that thing to lead into even more.

The graphics and effects are well done. Exploring the worlds throughout the star cluster can get repetitive, but it looks fantastic just the same.

The developers are active and introducing new additions to the game frequently as well, giving the experience refreshing renewal for multiple play sessions. 

Dyson Sphere is recommended for those that enjoy logical building and factory games. There is room for the game to grow, and the developer team is actively adding to the game, giving more value to the future of the game as well.

I do have some suggestions however:
 * TELEPORT. Interstellar travelling really gets annoying over time so this should be added as some sort of late game technology. Like selecting a waypoint to a destination, it should then be possible to teleport there directly. It could consume a warper or two. Heck, this could also be used on a planet scale. Just pick a point in planet overview and teleport there.
* LOGISTIC OVERVIEW: There should be a status page of all the logistic stations like there is for production. It should be possible to overview what a certain planet or star cluster is providing storing and demanding. It should even be an option to teleport there directly. 
* An option to auto replenish fuel and warpers for your mecha. Its just a needless step having to deal with that since there are fidget spinners providing you with the items anyhow.
* An option to set a travel destination from a planetary view.
* A way to label/bookmark certain buildings and then be able to search them and even teleport or set a waypoint to them.

Dyson sphere Programs end goal is to construct a Dyson Sphere, a mega construct to absorb the Suns Power, which is the equivalent to Factorios rocket.
The game itself is still buggy as of now, but considering that this game is barely 2 weeks in EA its extremely good and does not obstruct your gameplay experience.
Automatisation is the way to achieve this goal, and this, unlike factorio and satisfactory, comes without risk, there are no Enemies and if you need more ressources, just fly to another Star.
Yes, to another Star, this game has you play in a star cluster of currently up to 64 stars with 1-5 planets in Orbit, with rare ressources only found in other stars.

Although, I did find it irksome that the research is about calculating ""hashes"". It's like the developers are enamored with blockchains, but didn't know enough about the topic to understand that hashes only serve two purposes there: 1) To verify that the previous block wasn't altered. 2) To simply slow down the computer with excessive busywork, so the entire chain's checksums can't be recalculated within seconds, increasing the chances that the nefarious actor will be caught before they're done.

But once I cried myself to sleep and got over it, even at an early access point, it seems fairly well polished and competent, and shiny.

I feel like the Dyson swarm/shell construction should be introduced far sooner. There's a lot of work to get to that point, and it's the main theme of the game... and once you get there, it doesn't do a whole lot. By the time I reached the ""winning condition"" of researching the final main-quest technology (which had no technology?), I felt like I was basically done playing. My first shell was still building, but I didn't feel like I had to stick around, to either wait tens of hours for it to finish, or try to expand my production, just to see it complete faster.

The game also doesn't provide a lot of reason or incentive to go explore the universe. Sure, it was cool to find a black hole, and you can get the rare/valuable elements mine and shipped back home... but once that's done, why bother? I think exploration could stand the be reinforced. I think I could go to another star system and start building another Dyson shell/swarm... but why would I? You have to enjoy tackling the daunting in the first place, for a game like this, but that might not be enough to keep you going once you've gotten what fun you'll get, out of the game.

I did play with the resources being set to infinite, so I couldn't deplete them. That definitely affects whether you're incentivised to seek more resources elsewhere, but I was finding that depletable resources were sapping the fun for more. Any game will provide a list of hurdles and challenges to overcome, but I'm happy that the game let me decide which challenges I wanted to have, for the most part. My point is, however, the game should have additional reasons to explore beyond that all your resources are gone at home.",1668951344,1668951900,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Pros:
- Incredibly satisfying to set up production lines
- Space flight and interstellar travel is easy to control
- Logistics allows for easy transport of items across planets and star systems
- You can see your own (custom designed) dyson sphere being constructed in real time
- Research trees and upgrades give a clear goal and rewards for investing resources
- Difficult (nearly impossible) to mess up and be unable to recover. You'd have to waste all your starting planet's resources before getting access to space flight, which would be unlikely to happen by accident
- It's possible to share blueprints online, so if you're lacking inspiration you can find expert builds in many places

Neutral:
- No combat or time constraints (as of Nov 2022), I personally like this as I can relax and go at my own pace, but I know some people like the pressure this provides

Cons:
- Some materials are disproportionately difficult to make (e.g. organic crystals) and can really bottleneck your production early on
- Travelling outside of your star system isn't actually required to beat the game, and doesn't really grant huge benefits vs the cost of doing it
- Some tech unlocks are not worth it until later, like solar sails

It's very easy to start with and guides you from a single, planetary outpost to extreme, galactic level manufacturing without ever needing to search for guides. Note, this can be very taxing on your system, but I was able to get to a galactic scale build without ever seeing lag. You could likely put in 500+ hours on this without ever using half the systems or running into processing issues. At $20, the cost to time ratio is an extreme steel.

 I am writing in depth reviews for what i consider to be the three main factory/automation games, [b]Factorio, Dyson Sphere Program, and Satisfactory. There will be TL;DR's at the bottom of each section as well as at the bottom of the review[/b]

[h1] This is an early access review. When this game is fully released I will update review[/h1]

 Dyson Sphere Program (DSP) is one of the most promising early access games I have ever played. It is a prime example of a game that looks at the leader in the genre (Factorio) and iterates and improves on what worked in that game, as well as creating it's own unique systems. This is something that I think Satisfactory ultimately fails at and I will illustrate why I think that in my review. DSP has a lot of potential but I worry that it may suffer from feature creep, I hope that the devs can continue to add and iterate at the pace that they have.

[h1] Performance [/h1]

 Dyson Sphere Program, impressively is a pretty stable game. Even in it's current early access state, I didn't start seeing frame drops until deep in the late game. This is impressive because DSP is a 3D game, with multiple layers to it unlike Factorio. Planets are fully rendered, though lacking in detail, and once you have multiple bases on different planets, you can look up into the sky and see the fruits of your labor orbiting, launching or doing whatever else, even across space. It really is something to see, when you have a dyson swarm completed and you see the thousands of pieces individually orbiting the star. There is a list of options to assist with performance, however it's not as extensive as i would like, but overall the performance is extremely satisfactory

[b]tl;dr: for an early access game the performance is very impressive. Fully rendered planets, factories, and thousands of entities without frame drops into deep late game. The game is very visually pleasing to look at as well[/b]

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
 
 Like in Factorio your goal in this game is to automate a factory, though the end result is completely different. In this game your end game goal is to build a fully functional Dyson Sphere, and everything you automate along the way will assist you in that goal. To do that you need to produce data packs, which allow you to unlock things in the games expansive tech tree. This game is also on a universal scale, you are given a sector of a galaxy with dozens of stars, and planets to exploit, and eventually you will have entire planets completely covered in factories, absolutely teeming with logistics, and shooting things off to distant stars, it is very satisfying to see. Where DSP differs in it's factory design is with less of an emphasis on complexion of the recipes, and more of the mass production in my opinion. Adding in the extra axis by making the game 3D is used to great effect here, and it is carefully designed with many items to assist in with the extra complexity an entire extra dimension to build in adds. DSP, like Factorio, is not scared of big numbers, and also of just giving you the tools that you need to have to streamline efficiency. 

Using the inventory and building feels snappy, and satisfying. Everything is very clearly presented and even late game factories are easy to follow and see what is going where. The game also has a nice tutorial at the start that will help new players ease in.

 As of right now DSP does not have any external threats to your factory, however a combat update is in the works and it looks absolutely ridiculous and I will update this review when that is implemented. DSP does have a local, and planetary logistics system though not as in depth as Factorios, definitely does feel well thought out and extremely intentional in its design all logistics are done with either belts or drones. Your late game planets will be swarming with drones, and the space in between the planets will have swarms of interplanetary drones as well. As of right now there is now logic system for computation in the game.

[b]tl;dr: DSP's gameplay loop is extremely addictive, with very well thought out factory design mechanics that keep you moving towards your next goal or milestone. A responsive and easy to use inventory and blueprint system make for a game that flows very well from one objective to the next. Logistics in this are simple, but fun to use systems that are extremely fun to watch in action as they fly in the skies or between planets.[/b]

[h1] Early Access [/h1]

 I feel like one important thing that is often overlooked when reviewing early access games, especially on their full release, is how did the devs treat their community, as well as their game when it was in its early access period? I am happy to say that as of right now, while major updates have been slow, the dev team has been very communicative of their goals, and while pushing out minor updates, have continuously been working towards the large combat update. The team is open to feedback, and is quick with hotfixes when major bugs are discovered.

[h1] Overall tl;dr: [/h1]

[b] DSP is an extremely well designed and very promising early access game. The games performance is impressive on my rig with stable framerates up until the very endgame, there are many options to help performance as well. DSP has a fun and addicting gameplay loop, shallow but rewarding logistics systems, infinite scalability with the blueprint system, and a dedicated dev team that seems committed to providing not just a clone, but a competitor to Factorio.

Didn't even leave my first planet yet, but i'm loving the concept. And thanks that you don't throw hostile creatures at the player that tries to learn the game. I really didn't like it in factorio.

While it wears the Factorio inspiration on its sleeve - conveyor belts, inserters, assemblies and smelters, colored science inputs - Dyson Sphere Program also has more than enough of its own identity, and a lovely design, along with a pure focus on building. No biters here. Heck, I can even ram into a black hole and my mech is fine.

Starting from manually collecting resources by hand, you will go from a humble planetary industrial hub, to building your own megastructures and having a proper multi-system empire. And what is very impressive to me - spreading to other planets is not a gimmick, but a necessity. The game has its hooks in me and will not let go. After finishing Factorio for the first time, I at least had a moment of ""okay, time for a break"", but I keep getting more ideas in DSP.

I wish they'd implement a few quality of life updates, for example some overview of a planets logistic stations, so I wouldn't have to manually check which ones supply and demand specific materials, but the game is worth the full price right now.

If you get it, my recommendation is to not look up any strategies and go in blind. It's so satisfying to figure stuff out by yourself, and improve upon your designs.

Performance could do a bit of work though. Framerate can start to get a bit taxed with dense designs. Maybe another reason to spread production around.",1667126217,1667142362,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

A dyson sphere is an incredible project to centre a game like this around; it is a long term goal and how long it takes you is directly proportional to how efficient you have set things up. The devs are extremely active and work hard, and it shows. So despite some flaws, this game is a solid recommendation. Just a few points to keep in mind that I want to touch briefly, though I could go on for hours about the small details and design decisions of this game:

-> The game does not explain that there are features like tidal locking and variance in the rotational periods and inclinations of planets; this affects things like ray receivers for your Dyson Sphere significantly, and with a bit more info might prepare you to start building your (first) Dyson Sphere around a different star.

-> You can get stuck in space with no respawn mechanism if you run out of fuel. Autosave works and is frequent enough, but hoping for some sort of respawn mechanism to avoid this pitfall in future. Again, Early Access. 'Just reload a previous save' is not a great solution design-wise.

-> English localization has a solid B+ for effort, lots of voicelines recorded, but do not expect perfect English. To me, I honestly find it charming, rather than taking away from the experience, but some might feel differently. Voice acting is solid, even if the lines are likely machine translated.

-> There is no coop at time of writing. I don't expect it to be implemented by the devs, but there IS a mod for it, and it DOES work. The game lends very well to coop due to the ability to go to other system and do independent tasks while contributing to the same goal.

To reiterate, the game is excellent overall, and deserves the price asked. The devs are constantly updating the game, and I have no doubts this game will reach full release in due time. Too many early access games get abandoned; I sincerely hope to see this game reach full release and go on to make DLC and/or a sequel.

You start off on a planet in a randomly generated cluster of stars.  The game is rendered beautifully in full 3D with planetary axis, rotation, and orbit being relevant to energy production.  If you want to unlock techs in the game, you must complete ever increasingly complex mining, refining, and assembling (and logistical) challenges.  The game helps you get started with some simple in-game instructions.

Eventual you unlock the ability to travel to other star systems to obtain more resources.  And finally you have to figure out the elaborate process for creating a steady stream of sphere components and start building a dyson sphere.  I found that the factoriolab calculator for Dyson Sphere Program was very helpful for figuring out total resources and building ratios required for each new product.  Google it.

Once you have your sphere started, you ""win"" the game but you can use the insane energy generated by the dyson sphere to keep growing and expanding to other star systems if you want.  Or you can start over with a new randomly generated star cluster.  The developer is still adding features to the game.

I've played Satisfactory as well.  I love that game too.  But I never felt much of a purpose for meeting the various milestones in Satisfactory and it is much harder to build with the first-person point of view.  I really enjoyed the interplanetary and inter-solar setting and scale of Dyson Sphere Program and the top-down building point of view.

My only criticism is that there is so much unlocked potential to create more lively solar systems and challenges to go with them.  There is a variety of planet types but planets only come in two sizes, normal and gas giant and gravity is the same on all planets.  There are no animals.  There are no moons, no asteroids, no comets.  No solar flares.  No binary star systems.  Planets have no weather and the atmosphere is basically irrelevant.  Space is only a medium to travel through. There is no building in space other than the sphere for power generation.  Dyson Sphere Program 2?",1666292449,1666292706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Yes you do get to build a Dyson Sphere but first there is a lot of building, collecting resources and exploring your universe. It is not easy, even without enemies, but persevere and you will get there.
The UI is excellent. The first time you realise you can build up as well as horizontally brings a huge smile to your face. Travelling from planet to planet is good fun initially. Later you can make it easier and more fluid with upgrades. There are lots of upgrades for all your factory buildings and for yourself. These can open access to more resources. Nuclear reactors for instance. Even better you can even build a small star to power your entire base with ant-matter fuel pods. however at first you are limited to wind turbines, solar power and coal burning. When you move to different planets, as you will have to do at some point, pay attention to which power sources are available for that planet. Wind turbines will not work if there is no atmosphere. Solar panels will not work on the dark side of a rotation locked planet. Just like our moon but bigger.

The Dyson Sphere idea was brought to us during the 1960s, and this five-person developing team somehow managed to transfer this deep-scifi idea into a universe building game which is full of design as well as optimization drawbacks as the moment. But the point is that the idea is fresh and the construction line is thorough according to my view. Although the local language is not available for a large quantity of players at the moment. I am pretty sure that it will do better. We already have excellent building games such as the Factorio and Satisfactory which also uses the idea of expanding our civilization in other planets but where is the end of the game? This game has an ultimate goal which is not only finishes the research but also builds your own Dyson Sphere model. Everyone can be a designer and imaginable person to create yourself a Dyson Sphere. 
At the moment, this game is not included in the NVIDIA Geforce Experience or other Graphic Card Adjusting platform so you can't adjust the game to fit your PC. This game has not been optimized well so it really puts a large amount of burden on your Graphic Cards so do please prepare well for heat radiation and fan noise.
The whole game requires 80-100 hours to accomplish the goal and maybe even more when you are in your first saving just like me.  
In a word, this game is awesome and it will be better when it is fully developed. Wishing you a piece of unforgettable experience.

Updated Version in 25th, Nov,2021. The new content is below:（评论已于2021.11.25更新，更新的部分如下）： With the update process of the game, there are a few new highlights which we should mention. First, the battle system is now building and will be released in Q3 of 2022. Then, the building mode and the blueprint is much closer to our life and thought. Third, your Robot is able to be customized now! Looking forward to experience the battle system when it is out.

Updated Version in 15th, Oct, 2022. The new content is below:（评论于2022.10.15更新 ，新内容如下）Due to many reasons, the battle system won't be online until 2023, but the best thing from my point of view is that the recipe for almost product in this game doesn't change through these updates. Unlike Satisfactory which production lines have to be changed every time when a new update(Well, if it still can be called as an update) drops to the public. And I have to say, minor improvements such as delivery system between the player and the building system is just awesome and because of which the productivity of the robot can be maximized.  Let's hope and wait for the battle system and I will update it when more news are released to the public.

It's easier to build and scale than in Satisfactory, but you also get more of an open 3D world exploring aspect. Also lots of potential for playtime with different goals in the game (Building dyson spheres vs cranking out as much research as you can). Since I bought this the devs have added many great quality of life features and cool additions so that I'm wondering what's coming next. 

My only current issues with the game are a couple of things that I'm hoping the devs will address in the future. One of them being no easy way to deal with excess products. The other, is dealing with the Dirt/Sand. There's no easy way to get more sand for placing foundation. I found a mod that allows you to destroy excess products and gives you sand as a result. To me, this is a perfect resolution and fixes both problems. I would love to see something like this in the base game. 

Other than that, multiplayer would be cool but I don't think there are currently any plans to be adding that for a while at least. Also sometimes it feels like early game can be a bit slow and tedious, but the new logistics fidget spinner drones I think will help with that a little bit along with the metadata.

I'd give this game 98.555555555555555% percent as a score.

What do I hate - The controls are irritating over a long period of time, there is just so much mouse mileage and keystrokes needed to do simple stuff (which you will be doing a lot for hours!).

Ok ok, but but the blueprints would stop that! - No, they don't. I am willing to bet that 95% of users who try their first blueprint out find that it doesn't work for any number of annoying reasons. It takes practice sure, but isn't an easy ride.

So let's go back to the mouse/key mileage - First 10 hours of gameplay whilst you perfect and experiment...You place your conveyor, oh I need a sorter, oh I don't have one. Bring up craft menu because it wont jump to that item automatically which becomes irritating later on when you have lots of choice..so you start the build and it doesnt appear in your hand ready to use. Open inventory and hunt for item in a 8x8 grid full of pictures. At some point you are a little tired and you cant find it. 

Later on.... You're learning how to put together complex new things. You can't just pin the recipe oh no. You might place a builder to look at the recipe. Oh, you have to use the mouse to go find the teeeny tiny X to change the recipe (imagine doing this like 10 times over as you practice placing and figuring out efficiency) - all you want is a quick shortcut to choose recipe. 

Now the next thing might just be me but I find I'm having to do finger gymnastics just to select item, copy, paste new, inventory open, uh oh the two menus are in the way again, press escape/back once, oops, no twice to get rid of the other menu that stays open for no reason. Oh no, I dont have the item, better replicate it...repeat above. Oh no got to press the small X and choose. Oh no it's too close or too far from the box or conveyor, repeat all again. Press delete, hold shift to select all, delete, press back/escape twice to go back, press construct, repeat again. 
.
I'm going to go hunt for mods to see if any of this is fixed but otherwise I must keep playing because fun, but not for my wrist or wsad fingers.

It's well thought-through and you never stop learning. Sometimes I even go back to older factories and just replan them to have them nicer looking and more efficient. 

What I am personally missing is a better tutorial, you have to learn most of it by yourself, if you don't build a new factory or item, you will not learn what it does and you can simply overlook things. I would love to see some guidance in the beginning like ""build 3x this and then 5x that"" to help you in the beginning a bit better. 

I love the graphics as well, very stylish, the planets are different enough for me, and flying through space using Warp is always amazing. Maybe a speeding-up would be nice to have in the end game, or a kind of auto pilot, as I can imagine when you harvest the whole galaxy it can get boring and lengthy.

Update after 360 hrs: Average game can take well over 50+ hrs with current build. I have tried it on infinite resources and 50% resources. I found the 50% more engaging in terms of forced exploration but can be tedious in constant hunting new sources... though its fun to see all the different planets. 

Odds are if you play this on high resources you will never leave your primary star system and yet complete the entire game as built.

Update after 1000 hrs: the game is seriously well developed. There are of course small issues but the team building this game has done a lot to make playing the game more fun by adding in feature updates that make it easier to build out planets.

The game looks and controls fantasticly.

After hopping back in, I can no longer recommend this game. Barely any updates over the past year (blueprints and logistics chests I guess?) and many of the core issues are not being worked on. 

Devs have continuously pushed back against fans that want multiplayer, despite the fact that modders have already figured out how to do it. And the game is horrendously unbalanced, to the point that you can beat the game using only basic power gen tech right until you build a dyson sphere. People are also still clearly having trouble with the interplanetary navigation and we've all missed our planet and ended up drifting endlessly until we reloaded a save. 

I thought the devs would listen to the community, but they seem to only listen to the tiny fraction of hard cores that want to build giant megabases just for lolz and ignore that the core gameplay mechanics need to be properly balanced for the average player.

These devs are fucking heroes. Listening to community and constantly adding features that are being asked for.

It's peaceful and exciting at the same time, so it's a nice game if you want to take a break from something that's stressful. It's real time, but you don't have to sprint and the game gives you time and leeway to ""rebuild"" your operations to make them more efficient. If you like games like Factorio and Shapez, you'll love this game. 

Overall, very peaceful, but not mindless at all. I've restarted my world about 3 different times, not because I felt like I 'ruined' the world, but because I felt like I could build it and organize it even better.  

Here's something I'll add: give the game a couple of hours. The first world can be really slow if you're not strictly focused on building facilities and supply chains. However, once you discover that the point of the game is to build operations and automate everything, you'll get past your first planet and the rest of the game goes exponentially faster. Then the real game starts (in my opinion) and t's a really fun exploration process. I've only scratched the surface at 5 hours (and I'm still in my first star system, with 45 left to go). I'm super excited to see what this game brings as I continue to explore.

Edit: 6 more hours into this game and I can proudly say it is addicting lol. A few suggestions for the devs since this is in early access still:

- Make more chemical components besides graphene and sulfuric acid and plastic. It would be really cool to be able to make additional chemical compounds that can do different things - a suggestion would be to expand the silicon family of chemicals, because those are in the same column of the periodic table and have a lot of the same properties for that fact. It would also be cool to see things like Uranium or synthesized heavy elements get utilized and added as mine-able veins or make-able materials

- Adding species and aliens to worlds (namely the first planet) would really liven things up, especially if they had varying levels of intelligence and you could harvest them for materials or make trade agreements with them based on their intelligence level (or even better, help them evolve into intelligent beings).

- To combine ideas from my first two suggestions. A whole new family of discovery of genetic alteration would be pretty cool to add as well. You could effectively take the idea of the ""Spore"" games and plop that right into this game for an even better experience. DLC idea! 

- Currently, if you want to build something (like a building) and you have 0 of that item, it means that you have to manually open the replicator, find that item, and manually indicate how much of it that you want. It would be nice to have a feature that automatically opens the exact item page in the replicator if I click on an item that I have 0 of. For example, if I click on a storage facility and I have none of them built, it should take me straight to the replicator page for that storage facility. 

- Another nice feature would be wormholes and bending of space time to travel faster. 

Overall, this game is THE BEST world builder I've played so far and has so much potential. Bravo!",1664397988,1664465304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

One helpful thing I can point out is that your home system may not provide all the materials to advance your research into warp speed.

It is not less addictive. The reason was mainly there are (not yet) enemies disturbing the building and the nicer graphics and biomes. 
Finally, as I can judge so far some of the mechanics are a bit more convenient. No tunnels as part, instead the belt can be raised any time. Sorter can cover 3 lines.

Research and Mecha-upgrades is a nice element to feel progress not only in the factory itself.

I thought I would like this game, but something about it broke my computer. After playing for 10-15 minutes my computer was already visually stuttering and slowing down. If you have a good computer and like automation games I would recommend this but if you don't have a good computer I would instead recommend Oxygen Not Included or Satisfactory. If you aren't a fan of 2D games I also wouldn't recommend this game either as most of it appears to be 2D.

EDIT - By ""most of it appears to be 2D"" I was talking about the building and construction system, where you appear to be limited to a 2D plane that stretches around the world, without any option to build vertically, to my knowledge. In relation to my comment about the performance issues, I own a nine month old laptop, as of time of writing, and my frame rate was basically chopped in half after placing a little over a dozen items (check comments for list). Hope this helps!

EDIT 2 - Some items can apparently be built vertically, but only up to a certain height (5 or 6). However, to my knowledge, you are still unable to build assembly items on top of each other, meaning you are still limited to a bunch of (mostly) 2D planes for the planets. In games such as satisfactory you have basically unlimited verticallity, unlike this game where you are very restricted. I have a laptop with 12 gigabytes of ram, which is, by no means a high end laptop but also not a low end laptop either. Another point which I forgot to mention in my original review is the grid system’s inconsistency. The grid gets smaller towards the poles of the planet and larger towards the center. I am aware that this is an intended feature of the game, but I personally dislike it.

1) It's technologies are much more scientifically accurate then most games I've played which makes it particularly enjoyable that it's realistic in this sense.  It's depictions of astronomy and the distribution of stellar objects in our galaxy is ... quite frankly remarkable that a game designer cared enough to put in real marvel that is our Galaxy.
2) There's no time limits or pressure to get things done by a certain time so you can go at your own pace .. which will still take A LONG TIME to complete a dyson sphere even if you're rushing
3) There are so many things you can do that you'll easily find yourself lost for hours doing something that ultimately won't contribute to you finishing the game but you had fun doing it anyways.
4) Doesn't penalize you if you need to rebuild something, you get 100% of your resources back so you're not stuck with some setup you made early on when you were still learning that's an eyesore you dont want to tear down for fear of losing resources.  Tear it all down, and rebuild it the right way, there is no penalty (other then your time)
5) The space flight is a little clunky, especially early on before you've upgraded your Icarus appropriately..  Make sure to have some extra fuel on you because if you run out in space you'll have to wait for your Icarus to (slowly) regen it's power.
6) There is some broken English during the tutorial section but it's not bad and you can still understand what he is trying to convey.  People nitpicking this one little lack of polish are missing the entire rest of the game because this tutorial section with voice overs is like 15 minutes of the game .. and you can turn it off.
7) Just watching your dyson swarm and later dyson sphere be built around the star you've chosen is fascinating and super fun to watch.",1663470064,1663470064,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1) Graphics. I don't know what it is with these ""cutesy"" ""cartoonish"" graphics for far too many games these past ten years. It's a fad I really wish game developers would get past. 

2) Sound effects. For some reason, nobody seems to have noticed that the sound effects are stolen straight from Minecraft. A Chinese game developer stereotypically stealing intellectual proprerty from Western developers. Examples of Minecraft sound effects:

The mecha walking noises
Picking up items using the ""litter"" tool
The ""pop"" noise when your mecha inventory is full, and an item ""pops"" out onto the ground as ""litter."" 
Even the music is reminscent of Minecraft music.

For the longest time, I didn't even notice it. Until I randomly did at one point, and now that's all I hear. Minecraft noises all over the place lmao.

3) Language. The voice over is done very well 90% of the time, and the voice actor is pleasant to listen to. The voice actor doesnt ""try"" to be overly exagerrated like most games do.

 But the descriptions of some (but not all!) technologies sometimes make little to no sense. For me, its sort of immersion-breaking when you stumble across a new technology on the tech tree for the first time, and youre left scratching your head. 

Other than the sound effects, cutesy graphics, and language, it is a really fun game and you can easily lose track of time playing it, trying to reach the next goal. I would definitely recommend this game. Its really well-thought-out, well-executed, bug-free (at least, I havent noticed any bugs at all!) and works smoothly.

For language and graphics, I would knock off 1 point each.

For the stolen sound effects, I have to knock off a full 3 points. Stealing intellectual property is a Really Big Deal to me! 


I give it a 5/10.

PS:

Stealing intellectual property is typically a complete and total deal-breaker in my book. I always rate a game a 0 out of 10 for blatantly stealing from another game or artist, unless credit is given where it's due. However!

This game is overall, fun and creative enough, and the sound effects barely even noticeable at all. They're there, but they blend in so perfectly well with the overall environment of the game that the player isnt even going to notice it. It's so far from the central core of the game, that it was just simply incidental that I happened to randomly notice it. Because of the developer's ability to essentially ""bury"" the sound effects and provide an exansive and immersive gameplay, I couldn't bring myself to completely fail this game in my review, and will instead, actually recommend it. 

To the developer if you happen to read this:

1) Seriously, make your own sound effects! This would be huge!

2) Try to update the descriptive language with clearer English. Not a big deal, but it would provide just that much more polish and shine.",1663465960,1663465960,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,True

- Fresh take on the factory genre. So good I consider this one of the ""big 4"" (Factorio, Oxygen Not Included, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program)
- Unique goal and progress towards building the Dyson Sphere is fantastic and has gameplay returns.
- Multiple planets and planetary travel
- No ""magic resources"" (OK: Except Gas Giants). Factory lines need planning and appropriate spending.
- Infinite resource mode is built into the core game now, which just eliminates tedium (Contrary to what the game says, this doesn't make the game ""easier"".)

My #1 tip: TURN ON INFINITE RESOURCES WHEN YOU START A GAME FOR A BETTER EXPERIENCE

Bad:
- The English voice and tutorials are bizarrely non-native. Please just get a native English speaker to write the script!
- The space travel can be long and boring (especially at first). It would be much better if there was autonavigation between targets or just faster travel in general. Nobody wants to spend 2-5 minutes just flying between planets!
- Blueprints are unlocked strangely late in the tech tree which leads to alot of early game tedium. They should be unlocked towards the end of blue tech and before red tech IMO.
- Early game tedium in general. Tossing items in and out of boxes or playing ""lazy bastard""-style is really dumb
- Some recipes (like the new sprayers) are unnecessarily dependent on a single resource and a single way to make them. As a result, sometimes if you're out of certain resources there are ZERO alternatives, even at lesser efficiency / optimizations.
- The new ""hard mode"" with low resources is just annoying to play, it's not actually challenging
- Sphere based construction means that grids don't align correctly and make complex blueprints useless at large enough scale
- This is very much a ""base game"" like Factorio. It needs Angel's/Bob's/Industrial Revolution style mod support to get more interesting.
- Like Factorio, limited resources is the default, which leads to rebuilding your factory over and over. This is just annoying, not challenging.",1663443968,1663443968,True,23,1,0.681411385536193848,6,True,False,True

You start on a planet, then work your way up to other planets that are sometimes far far away

THINGS I WOULD LOVE TO SEE ADDED:
1. A better way to offload excess inventory. This litter system is annoying when cleaning up full lines of ore.
2. Autopilot to planets. The flying through space is pretty but I've got belts to lay dammit
3. Route management. I know this game is built by a very small team and am amazed at what's already been achieved. But if a boy could have a wish, it would be this: A way to visualize what goods are moving where are moving on a planetary and galactic scale.

There are no biters to deal with, and no survival mechanics either. So, the game can feel a bit shallow.

Here's a few ways this game is a little different than other factory builders:

- Your factories are built upon spheres... forcing you to make all sorts of interesting choices in planning.  
- The automated trade network you are eventually able to create includes many other solar systems.
- Later, you will design a customized Dyson Sphere, and begin launching bits and pieces to it.
- The sphere will slowly come together, and watching it do this is absolute bliss.

At a certain level of infrastructure, resources are no longer any concern, so you can craft the sphere like you were working clay... leading to all sorts of gigantic, satisfying pieces of art.  Almost like a Spirograph in space.

There are no enemies or combat... yet... (though ""optional enemies"" are planned).  It did not detract from my experience in any way.. instead, this game's building complexity was very entrancing and hypnotic.. and fun.  The graphics are sleek, the game runs well, and I didn't experience overt problems or glaring bugs.

Wonderful game, totally worth my 20 bucks.  Still playing it after 200+ hours.  I really would consider it ""required"" for lovers of chill factory building games, even in early access.

-------------------
After 400+ hours:  My review and opinion remain the same, but I will add these comments:
-------------------

- Once I covered a planet in infrastructure, the game would (understandably) lag whenever visiting that planet (My graphics card is a 2080TI).  FPS would drop <30, but it was never game-breaking for me, and was only after the planet was 90% saturated in belts and machinery.
- In my experience, all these factory construction games use an annoying save-file technique during the early access phase, and this game is no exception.  At the time of this edit, my save file is 400+ Mb.  This makes the autosave feature pretty jarring when it happens, which is every 10 min.  Somewhat annoying but I'm betting it improves when 1.0 comes out.
- Once the tech tree and first Dyson Sphere is complete, there's nothing else to do except expand and/or make more Dyson Spheres. I'm expecting more will be added in the future, and I can't wait!  I'd love to see the tech tree get even more complicated!


These are minor issues though... the game is still unbelievably solid.  I can't wait until the next major update and additions!  Still a hearty thumbs-up!

The progress isn't tedious and daunting if you are a seasoned factory planner and I could imagine if you are new into this type of games it will be an amazing discovery for you, in fact it's quite achievable, you still have to pour your hours and brains in to make a good and efficient factory but it doesn't feel like a task nor something reserved for the very best logisticians.

The part that DSP made me fall in love with it are the orbits and the planetary systems, it's innovative and refreshing. You must do interplanetary/interstellar logistics to attain certain assets, you may place some infrastructures in strategic places on the planet: solar panels at the poles to recieve a smaller but constant flow of energy or put them around the equator, put the dyson rail guns on the bright side of a rotational locked planet to constantly build the Dyson Swarm, etc. These are just a few examples of what this game has to offer.

Where I have to disagree with other reviewers is that this game doesn't have a Game Over/You are Dead mechanic. It does in a way that is, to me at least, way scarier. You can run out of resources if you are a careless spender and don't plan ahead, for example: you can run out of resources if you start the Dyson Swarm too early (Solar Sails have an expiration time unless you pour them into a Dyson Sphere). What I mean is that it is very possible to get planetary locked if you don't rush certain techs and prepare to achieve a planetary/interstellar logistics chain to support your main factory planet.

I still have to build my first Dyson Sphere and I can't wait to do it but I have to be very careful not to forget about my real life responsabilites. It's scary to see how the time goes by in a single game session and you don't even notice.

So Dyson Sphere Program is a ""YES, you should buy it"".",1661596740,1661596740,True,72,0,0.855795502662658691,0,True,False,True

I enjoyed this much more than Factorio as the worlds felt more inviting, the graphics are far better (I know the 2D/3D isn't a real comparison), and there are no environmental pressures here (e.g. bugs) which you have to fight off. 

The blueprint system is exceptional. The designs for everything felt extremely smooth and exciting to look at. The progression was easy enough to get the hang of, but I do have some experience with these types of games. I was very surprised at some of the customization options which were great to play with.

My biggest gripe would be with the English translation. It's as though the Korean developers hired someone who was obviously fluent in English to read from a poorly translated script, which was laughable at times. In some ways it added to the charm, but in others I would've preferred to not have been so distracted by it.

Spoiler: [spoiler] My other grip would be with how the game ends. It's just a fancy sound effect and a dialogue box. I get that it's not a narrative-driven game, but it feels so anticlimactic and a wasted opportunity.[/spoiler]

   This was my first ""factory"" type builder game as I love games like city skylines and other building and management games.

The mechanics are simple and the game teaches you everything along the way. the best thing you can do as a new player is go in and make an entire mess of things and have fun, you will eventually learn from your mistakes and you can always fix anything with out wasting resources. There is no rush either you are the only one slowing you down from creating your first Dyson sphere so its great to sit back and enjoy the amazing view along your travels.

What is DSP (Dyson Sphere Program), well the simplest way to describe it would be a factory building game, but the factory is on a Local Cluster size. You start out in your planet slowly building things on your mech and deploying them, from here you start the glorious road to automation, first the planet then the system and beyond, all this to reach your goal of building a Dyson Sphere  or two or things that are supposed to be a Dyson Sphere yet more closely resembles an art piece.
 
You research upgrades, you setup flight routes for drones and later ships that fly in system and you guessed it later out of system. 

It's the type of game that easily allows you to lose track of time due to the simple satisfaction of seeing things work out, the devs have been updating the game for as long as I've had it and as such I do believe that it will one day come out. 

The game also does have some pretty cool mods which does increase the fun factor. 

Long Story short, 
Do you enjoy building things ? 
Do you the idea of Mega Structures ? 
Do you want a genuily good game that does exactly what it says on the tin ( so far atleast)?
Do you not mind EA ? 
Do like forgetting the world exists and that sleep is a thing ?

They keep adding quality of life additions, to make the logistics easier to manage. Its really satisfying to see one of your planets launching thousands of sails and components into orbit. Its such a deeply intensive and also extremely chill game, that you'll never get bored, because there is always something to do. One thing I love is that the technology tiers are more difficult to achieve the higher you get. The first 2 tiers are easy to make, because you only need a level 1 or 2 refined product, but in the higher tiers, you need 3-5 cycles of refined products in order to make the right product to create technology modules. It forces you to think about logistics as well as space conservation and planning. In my case, Im more of  a spaghetti factory type setting where my path ways go all over the place with little regard to uniformity.  But, thats the way I like it. Some people like playing with more uniformity and sometimes even have entire planets dedicated to specific functions, like energy storage or smelting and transportation. Ive seen some players have entire star systems in complete uniformity all to ship its products to a system that contains a Black Hole and then building the sphere around the singularity, giving it inexhaustible and unparalleled power. I mean its pretty freaking cool to be able to build a dysons sphere around any star, but to build one around a black hole.... thats a different level of awesome.

So, I love factory building games like; Factorio and satisfactory. I also love space, Factorio has a mod that lets you go to space, but that's a mod, not a part of the base game. Satisfactory is a set map with no chance to go to space (that i know of. I have not done modding for satisfactory) And then we have Dyson Sphere Program. All of the above things i love while Heavily requiring you to go into space to harvest resources from other planets and stars that contain materials that the starting planet doesn't have, like silicone and titanium, and other rare resources not listed on the resource view for planets. The end goal of this game is to Create a Dyson Sphere (Basically a Star encompassing Solar panel), A theoretical Mega structure only possible by a type 2 civilization on the Kardashev scale. The shear amount of science in this game is enough to make a grown man cry. Now, my brain is very smooth, so i tend to struggle to wrap my mind around effective transport lines and efficient production, so i take a bit to get anywhere close to the sphere. But once i launched my fist solar sail and started a Dyson swarm (That's the first step to making the Dyson shell in this game) it was pure bliss, watching the EM-Rail Ejectors go to town firing off the sails into orbit was so rewarding for my smooth brain. And that's just the first step to making a complete Dyson Sphere! That doesn't include all the other stuff i had to set up to even launch the first sail!
If you are an avid science lover and enjoy Logistical puzzles and watching a massive structure come to fruition from your efforts, you will absolutely love this game.

First,  Love the game.  Very excited to see a good early access game because you can look forward to so much more content.  In this case the very late game is lacking.  I am worried that they will add combat into the game and make this into something that it was not intended.

The only way the combat would work is something like creeper world where the enemy is goo or mist or whatever.  The goo is advancing but isn't going to kill you quick.  Then your defenses would just shoot away all day every day as you chill out and build your dyson spheres (to combat the interstellar goo?). 

The coolest thing would be to look up and just watch all the guns BLASTING into space and constantly blowing away the ""creep"" like the matrix 3 when the sentinals breached zion and the guns were all just blasting the roof of the shipyard :D  That would be cool.

factorio does it by having tower defense element, progress or you will be overrun... even if the risk of being overrun is actually super tiny, it lets you maintain the illusion that the next tech is important

1. Graphics are very good
2. Goal is a great one

5. infinite space and possibilities to perfect your construction techniques and the different solar systems are great.

Bad Points:
1. Explanations as to how to use items are a little lacking 
2. Navigating between star systems is not straightforward until you get the hang of it.
3. Replication speeds are a little slow

A few notes to new players:
Get a game started and play it a bit, then scrap that game and start over. It takes a few tries before you get a feel for how it works.

By all means, go find some Youtube videos on building ideas and layouts, but some of the fun is coming up with your own designs and seeing how they work (or not).

Make use of a sandbox game to create your own blueprints and test out production line ideas. This really helps to understand how belts and sorters affect a variety of production lines. Sandbox mode also lets you unlock all of the technologies at once; the game isn't always the best about telling you why you might want to build a particular building or produce a particular resource, so being able to access the entire tech tree to see how one tech relies on another helps in the long run. 

Sandbox mode is also a good way of understanding how to build a Dyson sphere without worrying about messing up your regular game; there's very little direction on how to build a sphere in-game, which is a little ironic given that's the whole point of the game. LOL. 

The game becomes very CPU/GPU hungry the further you get into it, so don't be surprised when you hear those cooling fans kick up. :)

Past that the differences shine. The biggest is combat, Factorio has it, Dyson doesn't. This turns many away but A) Combat is on the way and B) This games goals are far more interesting in scale that combat being gone doesn't detract from the glory of building your first Dyson Sphere. Factorios main goal (aside from mods, mods are amazing) is to launch a rocket into space. We focus primarily on the transport of resources from one location in a map to another but past that pont, that is all. I sure felt joy as I saw my rocket launch into space, but there was something missing. The process to that rocket was not all that spectacular once I realized I had the production to do it already setup. It also wasn't THAT resource intensive as once you reach this point in the game, you should be SWIMMING in supplies and can easily manufacture the rocket. 

This is where Dyson excels. Building a sphere is a time consuming and resource intensive process that, (unless you've sunk thousands of hours into setting up thousands of solar launchers and rocket launchers, as well as all the sails/rockets needed to supply that) you will be constantly and slowly improving the speed of that process overtime, watching your spheres skeleton take shape, eventually finalizing and the sails filling the gaps and you slowly see your hard work take shape over time as you work as it's right above your head!

Factorio misses this one aspect as the rockets there and then it's not. Dyson sphere your work is much more tangible and amazing in scale.

If you like factorio but are not sold on a zero combat automation game, try this as I love combat and still enjoyed this and if you did like Factorio but wish the space elements were expanded upon, FIRSTLY try the space mods for factrio, really nice, but then try this for the true galactic factory sim.

- i liked the scenario (building a dyson sphere is just awesome) and sci fi and expected some kind of factorio variante
- i thought i have to build everything in one solar system
- i did expect some hard handwork for every factorio i created

So what did i get for 20 Euros:
- a really technical exeptional performing game !!! i am still suprised how a game with such complexity and scale can run that smooth 
- a galaxy spanning simulation with a cool android who can use warp flight mode to get from one system to another
- a deeply complex building system , with a great blueprint system that makes your work much easier and always inspires me for trying something new
- dyson spheres which can be edited by yourself and your creativity !

Pros: Very pretty 
Reasonably easy to follow progression
Very addictive

Cons: It feels like the game doesn't begin until you have interstellar logistics, and until you reach that point in the game it feels like a real slog. For a first time play-through I think the development it takes to reach interstellar logistics is necessary, but once you've done it once, it feels like it can be a real hassle getting to that stage on a new run.

I did put a lot of time into this game, but I would venture half my hours were AFK while I was waiting for things to happen or finish just because I hate constantly tearing things down and rebuilding. The efficiency of  some of the advanced buildings is so good that I'd rather for things to wait until I finally get the tech than having an inefficient mish-mash running in-between.

Maybe I'm just being irritable. But first impressions aren't great.

They tell you that ""physics are like this in the ACTUAL universe"" when the ship does some janky flying in the introductory cutscene. 
Except I've played Kerbal, and this is just on a whole another level of wrong. Vectors don't add like that. You don't kick a forward-moving football forward, and it instantly goes careening to your rear from that kick alone.
Please don't blame the viewer if you already know you made the mistake.
Either don't say anything, or fix the cutscene. 
You probably still have the code you used to render it lying around somewhere.

Also, I think attention was paid in to making it controller friendly. Gimping it slightly for PC and keyboard. I could be wrong on this one.
But the bindings in particular are very weird.
Z is never mentioned to be the pick-up-from-ground button in settings. Even though they copied it from Factorio I guess.
You also can't rebind inventory button to Tab. It's stuck on ""E"" for some ungodly reason, double bound with ""OK"". Which means you also can't rebind Q and E to rotating view.
The dichotomy between base-builder and controlling a main-character-in-a-3D-environment are all the more apparent in this game, where it can't quite figure out what it wants to do. Controls, or viewport wise.

Having said that, it is playable.

Overall looks and plays a bit like factorio without the biter distraction.
Some parts come off better, some worse. It's an interesting side-grade so far.

Crafting, automation, and tech progression working well so far. Once I got stuck by slow research, and the game had a popup tutorial telling me why. Apparently I'd missed a function of one of the buildings.

There's also no disruptive and annoying ""unskippable intro"". 
There is still one screen (Dyson Sphere). But it doesn't have any jarring movement, or colours that would lead to excess irritation. And it goes away pretty quickly, to another easy-to-look-at loading screen.

Overall:

Pretty? Yes.
Gameplay? Ok.
Space game? No. (Fix cutscene plox)

What is it? Factorio clone. Kinda.

Edit:
I stopped playing this for a bit, then never came back KEKW.
For 26 hrs, and the experience I got, this game's a bit on the pricey side.

My opinion's still probably gonna flip-flop between yes and no for a while. I wish steam had a ""neutral"" rating.",1655388694,1659981491,False,1,0,0.45267486572265625,0,True,False,True

DSP really nails it's sense of scale. Starting off manually cutting plants and trees to keep your mech powered and before you know it you're pulling resources from a dozen planets watching your Dyson Sphere be constructed piece by individual piece. It doesn't abstract this, every solar sail you fire you can watch in orbit and see it be incorporated into your sphere, you see the individual rockets carrying structural components. Along with the background comings and goings of planetary and interplanetary logistics vessels it's often visually striking if purely from the amount of stuff happening on screen. The optimisation is pretty damn impressive too, and while the FPS will eventually be impacted it's only because it really doesn't limit you in terms of what you're able to do.

It also makes things pretty easy on you. You'll make some early spaghetti but it never makes it difficult to deal with. There are a bunch of vertical levels for conveyor belts, it never feels like you've designed yourself into a corner earlier on. You can always spaghetti your way out. Further down the line with logistics towers spaghetti is (mostly) a thing of the past but it doesn't require redoing your whole factory. Draw a box around what you have and start making new nice modular bits with logistics towers, your initial factory doesn't have to replaced until you decide you want the space/resources it's using up.

I pay 0 attention in this game to ratios or throughput or anything. You CAN but also you can brute force more things and hook it up to your existing belts, my weird rube goldberg factory is in no way as beautiful as a designed, planned factory but maybe you're like me and don't care about that at all.

I only got this game a week ago at the time of this review and have sunk 33 hours into it so far; optimizing everything so everything runs smoothly.

The game is a logistical factory-builder, where you basically have to micro-manage [b]everything[/b] so your factory runs as smooth as butter. When you play the game, during your run you may find it hard to keep up with everything - like you run out of Energy Matrices, so you make more only to find out you're out of Sulfuric Acid, so you fix that supply line to find out that your Iron veins have dried up and you aren't producing any more Iron Ore/Iron products. It's a logistical nightmare, but a fun brainteaser. Basically, you can do what you want if you have the materials; it's fun to optimize your supply lines later on and straighten everything out.

As such, the game is in early access, which makes it a bit hard to find some bad things about the game, but I do have some suggestions - for example, maybe there could be a Hydrolizer building that turns water into Hydrogen or Deuterium, and then maybe add an Oxygen Burner power plant to burn off the excess oxygen from said plant; or maybe an easier way to teleport to planets (for example, if you needed a specific item that wasn't in your solar system or on your planet).

TL/DR   The game is good, but obviously needs some work. High potential. I highlight some negatives below, but I *do* recommend this game.

Things that I believe need to be worked on:

A. The English translations are acceptable at best. I understood (usually) what they were trying to say, but the noticeable errors are distracting. 
B. The ability to customize your keys is very bad and needs work or needs to just be removed. I wanted to switch TAB with E for inventory, but E is the only key that is unchangeable. I decided then to switch TAB with F, only for it to say TAB is now in conflict with something else even though TAB was *ALREADY* in conflict with 3 or 4 other things by default, just in different menus. If it was already OK for TAB to be in conflict with these things by default then why isn't it OK for TAB to be in conflict where I want to put it? Answer: it shouldn't matter. This just means that you *CANNOT* switch TAB to any other function which completely defeats the whole purpose of being able to customize keybinds. This is pretty much the same for every key, which means they should just take out the option. There are also actions that it ONLY lets you map to mouse keys. If I want my move-to-gather button to not be a mouse key then I should be able to do that.",1659658679,1659658679,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I am absolutely loving this game, while it has a few issues most of them can simply be due to it being in early access.  If you like Factorio you will likely enjoy this game.  The largest difference is, obviously, the focus is on building a Dyson sphere and expanding within and outside of your solar system.  Likely the most obvious issues would be due to the fact that it was translated from Chinese to English, which has resulted in some odd grammar, though it is still easily understandable.  I also found this game to be relatively short compared to something such as Factorio, though it is certainly not a quick game and can keep going for some time after finishing the main objective and the tech tree.  On this, it will likely be expanded in the final version but I can't say for sure, regardless it certainly offers enough content for the price.

The graphics are beautiful, especially when flying through space.  It is also extremely satisfying to slowly watch the sun be surrounded by tons of solar mirrors and then eventually have the actual Dyson sphere be constructed around it.

Overall, this was an extremely fun and satisfying game that managed to capture much of the same positives from Factorio while adding its on twists and improvements.  There is unfortunately currently no active threat to be vigilant against, but the vast goal of expanding throughout the solar system provides enough incentive to keep expanding quickly.  New content is still being added so you can also expect this game to get better the longer it goes.

TLDR-
Pros:
+Beautiful
+Factorio similarities
+Satisfying
+Content is being added
+Mod support is likely being added in the future

Cons:
-Mediocre Translation
-Relatively short (30-50) hours though can be continued long after completion
-Lack of active threat to worry about so it can get dull at times, though this is a personal preference
-Early Access
-Few mods and no integrated support

Conclusion:
Great game and definitely worth the money at base price, though it also often goes on sale.
I will attempt to keep this review updated but keep in mind they are actively still working on this game so things may change, it looks as though they are currently working on adding enemies for example.",1659591689,1659591875,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

If you haven't played Factorio, the learning curve will be similar but maybe not quite as bad. If you've played Factorio before (and I mean, really played it), you'll feel right at home here.

Some things are simplified (you start with electricity and construction drones, and lanes/belts are only 1 resource wide rather than 2), while other things can be just as tedious as in Factorio (belt management is probably the #1 issue, making undergrounds in Factorio seem much more efficient).

Where it really takes off is that instead of building train stations, you go out into space. Instead of new resource pockets on an ever-expanding single terrain area, you can go claim new planets.

The music is fantastic, although even music this good does start to wear on the ear after hearing it enough times. There is definitely variety in the music but you have to go visit other planets to hear it, and that takes a while. By the time you get off-planet you'll probably have turned the music off.

The tech tree is quite expanded and very satisfying and futuristic. Much of it should feel familiar to long time Factorio players, but again, some things are simplified. (Being unable to walk over pipes was one of my biggest irritations with Factorio - not an issue here, although I suspect in a future update they'll change the belts coming out of liquid storage into pipes, as magic boxing and unboxing doesn't seem quite right somehow.)

Honestly my biggest complaint is the often awkward game text and technology explanations, but if that's the worst thing you have to deal with, then you're doing quite well.

I should mention that if you enjoyed the combat aspect (aka having your hard work ransacked every few minutes), there's none of that here.

Just about every aspect of this game is orders of magnitude more satisfying than Factorio (and that's not saying anything bad about Factorio). Another of my favorite new additions is that the toolbar is automatically organized for you. I hated having to organize it myself in Factorio.

It's an engineer's game for sure, but may be approachable for others in a way that Factorio was not. It has less of the Age of Empires look and feel and a much more modern, sleek presentation. You'll want to have some decent hardware or otherwise this game could get quite laggy. I'd say, give it a try and you might just be surprised.

Very dynamic, and easily scaleable in endgame. Blueprints are a bit annoying to use until you learn it. Both a pro and con is how you have full control of how buildings are placed, sorta like the differece between red alert and zero hour.

[b]❤️️ Pros ❤️️[/b]
[list]
[*]The game runs very smooth and everything looks colourful and distinct from eachother so that you can easily tell what is going on.
[*]Sound isn't really important here but it felt satisfying to throw down new buildings and in terms of music it fits the theme really well (except there's 1 handpan song that gets tiresome after 50+ hours) 
[*]Multiple planets but you can see them if they're close. Also the dyson sphere is very well visible in the sky as you build it, which gives a great sense of accomplishment as you can really see it being put together piece by piece.
[*]Resource nodes are limited (which at first I considered a con) but you can easily get more without having to go too much out of your way. You won't need to rebuild your entire factory because you ran out of something and that is a design choice I really appreciate.

[/list]

[b]❌ Cons ❌[/b]
[list]
[*]The storyline is paper thin, but that probably has more to do with the fact that it's still in early access and the core gameplay is still being improved upon.
[*]The ""end goal"" is basically completing the final tier of the research tree. You'd think it's completing a dyson sphere but that's more a means to an end.  It's very underwhelming.
[*]Currently there is no such thing as a tower defence/threat element so it's really peaceful. I like that however I would like a challenge sometimes. Please note though: combat is apparently in development, so the devs might add that later!
[*]Flying between planets is a bit of a jarring experience. You can crashland into a planet with an enormous speed which is very strange and sometimes even disorienting.
[/list]

[b]Final thoughts[/b]
Dyson Sphere Program is a ton of fun to play and I only expect it to get even better as the game will come out of early access. This game is definitely worth a strong recommendation for anyone who likes these supply chain management style of games and is worthy of a place next to great titles such as Factorio and Satisfactory.

The game progression is simpler to understand and visualize, which is a big plus for such complicated games that requires quite a fair amount of brainpower. It allows you to focus your grey matter where it is needed and respects your time. 
Also the fact that you have entire round planets to build on changes everything: even though building is grid-based, you will have to account for the meridian geodesic which is really great.

Dyson Sphere Program is my first encounter with Automation Games and I cannot get enough. 
At the time of this review I have around 220 hours and still want to play this, most games I get bored of after around 80 or so hours. There is a lot to do and it can easily keep you busy and burn hours without even realizing it. 

PROS: 
 Excellent performance and optimization early to mid game
 Price 
 Beautiful yet simple visuals
 Mecha customization 
 Enormous sense of scale that I hope expands with further development
 Recipes are easy to remember and make sense
 Blueprints are excellent
 The Building aspect of the game is fantastic. Everything is very intuitive and smooth
 The UI is excellent and easy to read
 Camera freedom 
 Straight up addictive game play. It's highly satisfying to build and expand

CONS:
 Planets feel very repetitive
 Towards End Game it can get tedious and repetitive 
 The game really needs a marking/pinging system
 Warping mid to late game is unpleasant. Very hard to see where you are going when thousands of logistic vessels cover your 
intended location
 Once you're automating multiple systems performance starts to tank, specifically save times. It's quite jarring to have a full 1-3 
second hitch every time the game auto saves and it only get worse the longer you play the same game

I love the look of the game, it runs super smooth, and it's nice to have a clear goal you're working towards. The planets actually curve so you have to plan your builds accordingly, you can build vertically, and you can actually upgrade your mech among other things. Blueprints were also a fantastic addition that makes the game much more accessible to casual players who don't want to build everything. So far, the game has consistently been getting better over time.

The only thing I'm not crazy about is the ""standard"" logistics station build. I don't think that's something they can fix, it's more of a meta problem, but it's hard for me to imagine someone beating the game without using them. I'm used to playing games that have a difficulty curve that eventually plateaus at the end game, but it seems like factory automation games get exponentially more difficult as you progress. Solving simple logistical problems can be extremely fun and rewarding, but everybody has a different tolerance for logistics, and eventually it will start to feel like work rather than fun.

                                                           What is there to like about this game?
        The game is set starting on a lone, earthlike planet. You craft machines and use them to make more resources to make more machines to make more resources. For the grindy players focused on optimization, this might be enough to sell the game. 
     If you take a look at my profile, you can see I don't have many factory building games (factorio, satisfactory, hydroneer, etc.) So then why do I have almost 100 hours in this game? [b] Exploration [/b] The sheer scale of this game is mind boggling to me. If you were to try to escape your planet in the beginning stages of the game, you would quickly find that it would not take minutes, not hours, but [i]days[/i] to get to the nearest star system. As you progress you give yourself upgrade to go farther and discover a wide variety of stars and planets... and even find black holes. If you haven't seen the 3D rendition of black holes in the game, don't look it up. Play the game and see them for yourselves. [spoiler]I will say the sheer size of them absolutely terrified me on my first viewing and the euphoria I felt for finally being able to make it there was extremely rewarding[/spoiler]
     The main driving force for me, and the main satisfaction was being able to somewhat sate my curiosity of what a massive civilization would look like. I then easily spent several hours just flying around space and exploring the different planets. The fact that you can create such a massive feeling universe and still run at 80-100fps on a gtx 1070 and ryzen 5 1600 at all times is just worth it by themselves.

This is an amazing game for you.

The only issues I had were autosaves can be a bit intrusive and the controls for building were a bit challenging for a lefty like me, but I was able to get around it and still have a great time.

I'd give it an 8/10.


As a space guy, I'd like to see more structures and types of debris flying around. Asteroids, planetesimals, clouds of stardust to fly through, just small things to make it a bit more varied.
I also cannot wait for the enemy mechanic. The option to choose is great, but personally I enjoy that extra challenge.
Finally, and I know this isn't a planned feature, but being able to take advantage of this massive scale by playing a multiplayer mode where you compete with your friends to make a dominant civilization and utilize combat mechanics, or cooperate with them to build a civ together would easily make this game an instant classic in my book.

I've only got to tier 3 tech so far and am a huge dumbass but my spaghetti homeworld and silicon/titanium mining colony feel so FUN to play around with. When you unlock a new thing there's generally not an urgent need to instantly trash all your existing designs to fit it in and instead you're encouraged to just set up parallel factories for each thing in a much more gentle and creative way.

Beautiful, similar complex item-system (but no complex logic: no counters, switches, sensors or lights), more space, different biomes.
No enemies yet (but announced for next update), endgame is mass-production (factory must grow) to build dyson spheres (faster) in other systems and endless research (capacity, speed etc.)
Building on a planet (sphere-shaped) is easily managable only annoying at the poles.
Blueprints and building mechanics make building big productionlines a breeze.
Orbital Stations > trains (factorio), though less micromanageable (no destination spec just supply/demand)

At the time of the review my first sphere is almost done and im planning the next sphere in a different system playing around with the sphere-design and orbits.

Mods: unofficial Multiplayer-Mod works really good with 2 players (didnt test more) but requires hamachi and a mod manager.

A factory-building/resource-gathering game at its absolute finest, with an interesting and powerfully unifying final goal. Players are, collectively, simply by playing the game, working to create a Type III Civilization on the Kardashev Scale.

I have virtually nothing negative to say about this game. The worst thing I can come up with, is space flight is slightly not intuitive, sometimes.

This game is on another level. The intricacy, the science, the premise, and the execution are all so well done. The game isn't large, it loads fast, saves fast, closes fast, and lags for maybe a millisecond when auto-saving, at it's worst.

The game is near functionally complete and there is SO much to do. There is a definite end game. I restarted once already to fix how my initial factory was, and realized very quickly the true scalability that they're going for. Like... I guess it's a spoiler but the whole point is to build a dyson sphere around a star, and work through the technological and logistical hurdles it would take to get you there.

Wild game, totally worth it. In my second playthrough, I'm just now automating red science some 15 hours into it. Wish the blueprints were already in, but that's coming.

The devs are VERY involved, and have laid out plans in their FAQs. If it feels like its missing something, more than likely it's on the devs radar.

No combat yet, but that gives it a sort of chill vibe to build that factory as big as possible as fast as possible, and see how crazy it's gonna get.

Get it. Full price this bad boy. Support good devs!

[b]YOU BET YOUR SWEET PAPI[/b]

Ok so truth be told I'm a bit newer to automation games. Grew up on RTS/Turn-Based Strat games, tons of FPSs, RPGs and MMOs, but my love for automation games came about early on in my twenties a little less than a decade ago.

I love a lot of the simpler-style games (Factorio) that use a relatively simple graphics style to mask a deceptively complex and near-infinite reach of possibilities in terms of just how far you can take it. 
On the other end, you have games with much more masterful and impressive graphics systems that use it to boost a slightly simpler assembly process, which I feel is where [b]Dyson Sphere Program[/b] fits in. 

[b] [u]THIS IS NOT A BAD THING![/u][/b]
One thing that always seemed difficult for me in games like Factorio [i]was[/i] the near-infinite depth to the game; at a certain point I just found myself almost at a loss for what to do after a certain point, and in certain game modes where the mobs continue to grow, evolve and multiply over time, this could spell unavoidable disaster for any player that failed to seamlessly grow there assemblages and supply lines as before long, your procrastination has resulted in a grand mob so far past you, it's literally impossible to reload a save with the hopes of outbuilding the AI and managing to escape your fate.

[b] [u]DSP ELIMINATES THESE ISSUES WHILE STILL MAKING THE GAME INTERESTING[/u][/b]
For me, this is where the graphics system really comes in to play - simply put, [b]the game is beautiful![/b] I would find myself relentlessly driven to reach the next tech level and further my production means not to keep a step ahead of some ever-growing AI-driven enemy, but because I eargerly awaited exploring the next world! The universe itself is scaled in such a way that every time you feel you've finally started to master a given level of production, you gain the ability to explore new worlds around your star; before long you're exploring distant star systems, finding new worlds with rare and useful resources, colonizing these alien habitats with your automatons to begin ferrying these novelties back to your homeworld where they would find a place in your ever-growing massive assembly line.

Dyson Sphere Program may lack the limitless possibilities of games like Factorio in their ability to allow more items to be produced than most players could ever dream of, but it more than makes up for this by creating such a beautiful universe for you to explore. The game does a wonderful job of pacing the advancements in such a way as to keep you engaged and working towards the next planet or star to explore, instead of getting bogged down in depths with goals so far off in the distance that you end up putting the game down due to the sheer time it would have required for you to complete.

The resource types and numbers are expertly calibrated in such a way that as your assembly lines expand from entire planets to solar systems to star systems and eventually entire galaxies, your time will have to be spent somewhere between colonizing new worlds and scaling up both the size and efficiency of your earlier systems so that the increasingly complex items continue to be pumped out in large enough numbers that these systems may feed not only planets, but eventual star systems and then entire galaxies filled with your automated creations. 

Honestly, this game does a lot of things right, and the lack of any against-the-clock countdown mechanisms allows for an incredibly relaxing experience, which when coupled with the amazing world it leaves you to explore, filled with countless planet- and star-types, leaves you with a supremely enjoyable gaming experience.

The only thing which prevents me from giving the game a full 10/10 is the fact that the game (at the time of this writing) is still in a early-release state, and while bugs/VERY occasional crashes are to be expected and will (hopefully) be worked out by the time the game launches, are still there and while again VERY rare are prevalent enough that I have to settle for a 9/10

Graphics are great 
U/I is relatively simple
Controls are well thought out
Resource and Techs are brilliantly paced
Experience is relaxing and engaging

For those who have a long experience on similar games such as Factorio and Satisfactory (I have played a lot on these), this is a mix of both : the automation looks like Factorio (ie. Smelting arrays) and the story looks like Satisfactory (ie. Sci-Fi based).

The background of this game scientifically talking is also incredibly realistic, even if this is still Sci-Fi, it stays accurate: the researches are based on real life discoveries and theories, and they're adapted pretty well to be understable and logical in the story 

I was bluffed when I learnt that it's a team of only 5 persons who developed this game, and furthermore in a tiny office! This is a miracle that it only cost $20 on Steam and ~$6 on Instant Gaming. Personnaly I am at the limit of being guilty to buy this game because it is so cheap !

The soundtrack and the graphics are very good too, in my opinion.

The performance requirements are pretty low for such a game and can be easily optimized if necessary.

The only issue is in the late game, the autosaves start to be pretty big and since they happen every 5 mins, it's a bit annoying.

The second big problem is thatw after entering the far end game (150+ hours), the pattern of playing start to be repetitive, even if the Devs have made an update with several new buildings, the construction is pretty much the same at this moment.

Overall, this game is easily one of my favourite, as it mixes to of my beloved games and correspond exactly to what you would intend of it. I definitely recommend it to anyone who love factory games: I've easily already passed 70+ hours on this game!

Also, English is not my native language (I'm French), so, please excuse any grammatical misconceptions.",1655992892,1655992892,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,True

But nobody ever got off the planet. There is something about managing traffic flow and just the sheer amount of stuff created in this game and putting it all together is pretty fun... on hundreds of planets.

I have about 5400+ hours on DSP. When you start a new game at first it is all micro managing your nodes and building a new part every time you get an upgrade, vs power, and ratios, blah blah blah. Once you get fairly advanced if you micro manage, you will get carpal tunnel, blueprints are your friend on the factory and planetary levels. If you have to do something twice by hand just blueprint it blank with no assignments. then as you fill the assignments take a blueprint of that and save it with an assignment

The game is different once you get along in the game. It is more about managing volume than managing a perfect ratio of one mini mall, you are constantly evolving and adding nodes or factories or just a lot of stuff. Eventually you have whole planets making sails, another building rockets and multiple full iron ingot smelting planets. Think bigger than just a planet, don't limit yourself in this game. Once you unlock the new miners you can literally set up your power grid and drop the buggers all over the place move on, next thing you know you don't have enough smelters to deal with the ore, so then you expand all your smelting, and on up it goes till you have full solar systems devoted to making white matrix and consuming them. I wish I could find a solution to getting so much stuff the game slows down, eventually is unplayable and you have to start all over again.

Have a great time in this game,
Cloven

In my first review i was not satisfied with this game, and i am still not, But it has improwed alot over the last few month.

Now the game needs more end stuff, like a teleport between planets, better mining station, so mining can be made by blueprints and more like that, but i am sure the game ends there someday

I wrote earlier
In the beginning it is fun and a interesting game. I still mean that.

I also wrote it feel like a work to play. I dont know what changed, but the same feeling isnt there anymore.

The sound is terrible and after a few hours I turned it off. - It still is

The graphic in space, the different stars and the beautiful black hole is magnificent.

The gameplay needs a lot of new solutions not to get boring and it needs a lot more tech as there is missing alot of options - its on the way, but not there yet

Good strong game! 3 STARS out of 5.
I've had a good long time with this game now and started last year with a very early release. Here are my takes and gives...
PROS:
-Innovative resource management / building game. 
-Build at your leisure and with your goals in mind
-Truly colossal building potential with extraordinary energy generation potential.
-Research into technologies and upgrades follows a logical pathway and bridges the gap of unrealistic reality. 
-Use strategy to make your factories efficient - you'll need it so you don't break you computer (more later)
-Stacking, 'painting', the new miner and blueprints have made huge improvements to the play and possibilities.
-BLUEPRINTS! BLUEPRINTS! BLUEPRINT! This games would not be playable without them in my opinion. Yes, you can have small creations but if you are truly thinking on a BIG scale you won't survive. I played a couple hundred hours without them and believe me they are a welcome addition!
CONS:
-Conveyor belt construction is horrible. I have nothing good to say to about this system. You loose 1 whole STAR on my rating for the poor building construction in this game. I have 2000 hours now of dealing with this contempt for players and it is the weakest link. To be fair I don't believe the game studio has contempt for the player but this is an area where you feel like it. 
-Rail gun control. You can set up an incredibly complex supply and distribution network in this game. You can call out and order for any item you make from across the star cluster instantly but you can't tell any kind of grouping of rail guns to change an orbit. You must click each individual gun and change it. To put this in perspective.... I'm now on my 70th TW of energy production between two star clusters. I have rail guns in the tens of thousands and you want to make me change each one individually! To be fair you only have to build it once then make a blueprint but I DID ALREADY! This is another area you may feel contempt for the player during game play.
-Main Character. I personally don't like the main character in this game at all. I couldn't remember the last game I played where I disliked (to put it mildly) the main character so much. This largely has to do with the character abilities or lack there of. The character is a big oaf! It's like steering a cruise ship and lacking in style and any semblance of grace.  It's like pulling around a big lead weight that you have to have with you to do anything. He's got an impressive power core no doubt but he can only muster a 5W flashlight to help you do your work. That kind of sums it up. 
-CPU FPS; Depending on how you choose to play this game you may likely choose to see how much energy potential you can harness as I did. Be advised that this game will eat up your CPU and bottleneck. At the time of this review I have about 500 hours of play for a factory that consumes about 100 GW and has a total energy potential of 44.5TW. I am down to a dismal 11 FPS! I'm running a AMD 5600X, 32 GB 3600 RAM, GTX1080, 2 TB NVME. 4 of my 12 threads run about 85% while the rest are about 40%. My GPU is now only at about 40% where it was full throttle in the early part of the game. I honestly don't know how much longer I can play. I'm done building (I've done almost everything I want to do) so I will just let it run for a while-Maybe 60-70TW).  
CONCLUSION: This is a really good strong game and there is a reason I've been engrossed in it for 2000 hours. There's so much to say but you can find that out for yourself. I would recommend this game for sure. Just understand there are very rough spots in my opinion. 
STRATEGY: Completely up to you! If you want some good solid general recommendations read on.
-Realize the potential of your star cluster! Take the extra time to click through random generations until you come across some with high levels of Type O stars. These play off the best. If you can get a blue giant in there too you are golden. You may not even be able to finish a blue giant so don't be greedy.
-Don't rush in! Build your initial needs in modesty. Use the resources you do have to get all of your tech and necessary upgrades done first! This will save you time in the long run and once that is done you  are off to the races with nothing to stop you and no worries to upgrades in massive factories.
-Work to build modular factories for a specific purpose and output. Build stand alone modular rocket, sail, anti-matter fuel rods and paint. Work on making them most efficient you can then make blueprints.
-You can build modular factories to fit 1/8 sections of the globe and give yourself the potential of getting 8 factories on one planet. One of my planet rocket factories makes 1650+ rockets a minute and is 8 individual rocket factories that operate completely separate from each other.
-Make sure you are keeping your supply up to the demand. Specially with the paint. You can bring down your whole star cluster without it if you are using it and you should!
-Paint only top tier items and..... sails! Yes you will need large amounts of paint so plan on making a number of modular factories. 
-Don't overdue the warp drive. You can get going too fast and it becomes a liability when your FPS drops (and it will) if you make a big factory. 
-Use the vast majority of your early upgrades on mining, drones and transport speed. These give the best benefit during early game play. 
-NUMBERS: This is a numbers game and to get big you have to make a lot of things. At 500 hours of my second complete game play through I have the following numbers to give you and example of what to expect to achieve about 45TW. I took a very leisurely approach to building.
Iron Ingot - 2.64G, Silicone Ingot - 1.20G, Hydrogen - 3.47G, Rockets 46.3M, Sails 1.22G

Lots more to be said but you can find that out on your own. Happy building!!

im not a factory genre lover, because its way to boring and disgusting, im RTS and FPS gamer
but this game.... omg.... i completely slap my face multiply times on multiple saves, countless times
let me explain, you little phit :
-
= Pros : 
- 93% realistic (inspired from irl science)
- the early gameplay is solid like the future of this game
-- the early gameplay already complete like a full game, compared other ea-state games (has the most BIGGEST potentials compared to all my games i have played in my entire life)
- you can try the most craziest things and
-- you can go WAY bigger, like multiple star systems...., with many type of stars and planets, and harness their kind of types, and build the biggest factory logistic ever, to build a megastructure, dyson sphere
- the graphic is CRAZY, with alright amount of GPU usage, everything looks very beautiful, almost complete realistic scenes, and stable, like the future of this game
- one of the best thinking and strategy game
- the amount of contents since release to my review date, is UNBELIEVABLE
-
= Cons (joke, this is pros) :
- you will forgot being hungry, thirsty and sleepy
- you may lose your irl if you not careful, while being the most happy man in the world, you will feel refreshed, and can continue your irl with even better feeling
- you will dont even know what is your current time, a week can just gone in just 2 hours
- you will pog countless times for almost every 15min - 1hour
-
= Cons (ok, the real one)
- the engine still cant handle massive progression, like multiple dyson spheres or 15x fully build solar system (except you have strongest desktop to date) [again, this is early access game]
- i have seen another game companies literally want to take this game down in many ways, including their devs, because how bright the future of this game, lmfao
- nothing (for real.... this game doesnt have any cons left after this many gameplay hours is pogging me)

buy this game, this is not recommendation, its necessary

A couple of things are a bit more streamlined than in Factorio: there are no different inserters for different distances/filters, there is no separate system for liquids, the transportation across planets is way less finicky than the train system of Factorio (although also less satisfying when it works). The Endgame of DSP is also nicer, because in Factorio you essentially have to make your own goal, while here the longterm goal is clear: build a Dyson Sphere.

There are however also a bunch of things that are less well worked out. Because you are working on a sphere, it is much harder to reuse parts of your factory, as different tropic zones have different grid sizes. This means much more must be constructed manually. There is also much less fine-grained control over the logistics system, and no logic systems to do some more custom logic. There are also a bunch of things that are still very much early access, such as the bad English translations.

Pros:

* Very well optimized. It runs well even on several generations old hardware. Considering how much is going on in the game I feel this is a big achievement for the devs.
* Catchy and environment dependent music.

You will be able to see and observe the entire process from up close, which can be rather inspiring and simply beautiful. The entire ""space mechanics"" part of the game is great. 

A setup of about 200/min of small carrier rockets is recommended + extra solar sail. Once the sphere is done you can make another and another... Nothing else to do.

IF you setup everything perfectly there is nothing much to be done while the sphere is being built - it can take a lot of time. Depends... This is more or less it, currently.

It is very important you stick to the production ratios otherwise you will just waste your time, going around in circles. Go to dsp-wiki to see Recipe and Building quick reference.

Make your construction area between ""Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn"".

Pay attention to stuff such as belt capacity. Like L3 belt being able to handle the output of max 15 arc smelters where each unit takes 1 seconds to produce. Feeding 30 arc smelters in a row, on a single L3 belt, is only doable once all the stacks are researched. Casimir crystal production will gobble up tons of hydrogen, even with max stacks researched you can not put too many in a row...

Hopefully the game will evolve, with some story, plot twists, additional industrial mechanics/options/aspirations etc 


Some thoughts:  

- would be nice if taking items out of logistic stations could be done in a more accurate manner than the current slider thingy
- would be nice to see power details in a single window, what source provides how much power and what consumes power and how much [by building type/item/specific] 
- would be nice to continue to see detailed star system resources [from other systems] after you visit the system
- would be nice to keep the belt memo icon pass the spliter 
- would be nice to have a statistics panel with production surplus or lack in %
- would be nice to have adjustable size [larger size] of area select delete
- would be nice to have/be bale to set favorite travel locations    
- would be nice to have saves of positions on the planet, like a position marker
- would be nice to have an option to discard resource on production with facilities that produce 2 resources [hydrogen] 
- would  be nice to have an option/recipe using the antimater fuel rod for small carrier rocket
- even with the energy surplus, i was unable to charge the interstellar logistic station with continuous arrivals and departures, resulting in 3 vessels not operating, even though the remote resource was available and so were the space warpers, resulting in duplicating the stations, which seems redundant  
-placing chemical plants manually lets you put them too close. Blueprinting and attempting to duplicate it is not possible due to collision
- would be nice to have fancier textures/graphics for L2 smelter, L2 and L3 assembler
- power lines in the age of artificial stars seem like medieval technology, there should be something else or eventual no need for power lines
- satellite substation is way too bulky",1654602291,1654602291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This makes researching upgrades meaningful since not only are you awarded through new buildings, you're also upgrading your mech for more efficient interstallar travel. 
Finding rare resources in outer space, travelling tens of lightyears and thinking ahead - bringing with you an inventory filled with the correct items and materials to setup a self-sufficient mining colony - is immensely satisfying. 
In contrast to this, making the Dyson Sphere is kind of meh. 
If it had more functions than giving energy, things might be different. 
Still, it looks cool. And you can always build multiple Dyson Spheres. 
Currently the weakest part of the game IS THE ENDGAME. There should be more to the Dyson Sphere. 
There should be lategame super important cool items that require turning entire planets into factories just to make that one specific item.
There should be automation available in the form of bots - ultra lategame options for sending pre-programmed bots to convert planets into factories.
There should be a way to manipulate stars, altering their power output or creating other sorts of anomalies.
There should be exotic ways to harness black holes in some way.
And the very endgame should have the map expand into an infinite universe... where the player realizes they will never have enough time to colonize everything... only to discover one last technology to be researched which allows for swarms of interstellar bots to convert planets into factories en masse.

It is early access so when you copy and paste something the size of a quarter of the planet, you will notice bugs. That being said, you don't need to build at that scale to beat the game. 

Also when building the sphere, you can't copy paste parts of the sphere, you can only copy the entire sphere and paste it in another system.

1) More ways to organize things - making some notes over planets, some building that allows you to see what's going on in other systems without flying there
2) More lategame milestones, maybe more tiers of buildings, perks that you obtain for delivering some amount (amount/minute) of resources to special building, global scoreboard (I know the Milky Way view, but it's not enough to encourage the competition). Idk, I just want ultralate to be something more but a building tons of same blueprints on them planets.

After i changed the game's settings on Steam to turn off ALL Steam Input, the game started REAL FAST and WORKED FLAWLESSLY with NO mouse glitches or rightward-drift. WONDERFUL!!!

UPDATE 2:  my mouse pointer INSISTS on DRIFTING to the right -- CONSTANTLY -- after having left the game idle in the pause menu for a long time.  SIGH.  I had to EXIT the game because i KNOW the game was causing the right-ward mouse drift as that was NOT HAPPENING when focused on other applications which were also open at the same time.  I hope now that restarting the game app will stop this STUPID behavior.

UPDATE:  This game NOW PREVENTS ME FROM USING MY KEYBOARD (and i have unplugged, re-plugged, unplugged, re-plugged it to try to avail this BIG PROBLEM!!!)

It's basically a MUCH PRETTIER version of Factorio, because it is an ASSEMBLY LINE 4x type game, but without the same story as Factorio.

1.) Cosmetics and Decoration - I feel sad when I can't decorate a fully working factory. All of your machines are just out in the open.

2.) The outer space feels lonely - It might look good when your dyson sphere/shell is already up there, but that's the gist of it. It would be better if there are random small entities that appears (can even give legendary stuff). So you will explore the space more rather than just jumping from one planet to another.

3.) Mother ship - I just hope that there will be a main mother ship you can build with that can also travel around the space.

Dyson Sphere Program is a work in progress game. Not everything in the game completed, but for the most part, the game is absolutely playable. The most irritating issue for me is that there are only English and Mandarin translations. The player must add their native language as a mod. Building a Dyson Sphere is one of the most profound experiences I have ever had playing video games.

This game is a like a cross between Satisfactory and Factorio because of its graphics and mechanics. Looking at gameplay footage pre-purchase will help you to understand what I mean. 

Gameplay: The numbers are for the most part easy to work with, however, there are some challenging recipes that can cause you to go absolutely nuts. This game can take up a majority of your time, I had a huge number of hours in a small amount of time before I largely stopped playing and moved on to other games like Factorio and Satisfactory which have both more grind and content.

Overall, I would rate this game a WIP/10. I will not be able to correctly judge DSP until it is completed and is published to everyone. I would recommend that you buy it, however, as it is a fantastic game.",1612146464,1653100351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

In short, this game so far is the meeting point of Factorio's detailed factory planning and construction and Satisfactory's gorgeous 3d visuals. All bent towards the goal of eventually conquering your little corner of the galaxy by creating a titular Dyson Sphere (or more than one). 

While combat of some form has been stated to be a major goal of this game, the current state of being able to create, plan, and endlessly tune (and troubleshoot, in my case) your factory to be as efficient as you can make it has a relaxing, thoughtful quality that I don't quite get from this games' inspirations. 

Despite the game's early access nature, the gameplay feels very well-tuned, and the visuals are already spectacular - even on my aging hardware. No game I've seen so far has been quite so awe-inspiring with it's visual spectacle. What makes it all the more satisfying is the thought that it's a spectacle you, as the player, create for yourself - instead of having it dumped on you like in so many action games.

From your humble beginnings on the starting world, to watching your arrays of magnetic cannons fling solar sails into orbit for your dyson swarm, or arrays of launch sites sending flight after flight of payloads to the dyson sphere proper, the visuals never stop being gorgeous, and become even more awe-inspiring the closer you get to your goal.

What issues this game has so far are rather minor. The localization on the voice-over could use some work, but is still easy enough to understand. I have concerns for the upcoming combat mechanics, but am withholding judgement for the time being.",1653100216,1653100216,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Old negative review was because of a Unity engine bug they took several months to resolve which caused the game to go from perfect to unplayable for me.

I can't type anything in the game, move with WASD, can't exit the tech screen without keyboard (only button is Escape..)... but I could Alt-Tab and type into notepad or other Unity games or whatever.

Early Access in name only. This is a fully fledged, incredibly deep management sim with beautiful progression. The game is paced incredibly well, slowly moving you up in complexity and (playfully) forcing you to interact with all of the varied mechanics that you will eventually need to master.

Update May 2022
**********************
So they made a lot of changes, improvements, new stuff. It's amazing how an early access game this amazing is only getting better and even though for now the game lacks multiplayer, through the nebula mod this is now also possible and works pretty well. There are ofcourse some issues that the game doesnt handle well since its playing modded and with 2 or more players for which it is not yet designed. 

But it does make the game 100x more fun, to play with friends is really worth it! And the meta-data stuff they recently put in makes restarting a new game much easier.

Looking forward to much much more from these devs! #impressed



Original review:
**********************
Ok like so many others, the game is like many other great games, but better :D

Ive played 2000+ hours of factorio. But this game pushed factorio to the side. Havent played since i got DSP.
Satisfactory similar thing. Played that for a good 1500 hours and not touching it anymore now i got Dyson Sphere Program. 
The round shapes of the map are a refreshing way of playing and remind me of my times of Planetary Annihilation. Shame we cant yet build engines to move planets closer together, now that would be a sight :D

Yes early game is a totally slow grind, but it makes it so worth it when you get to that movement speed research and unlock it. Its actually rewarding to do the research on upgrades. And the slow pace of the game is kind of relaxing. The graphics are smooth and everything looks great. And when you hit late game and start doing the Dyson Sphere, it all kind of speeds up. 

The Chingrish (google translate version of Chinese) is a problem though. The tutorial only gets you so far and you need wiki's quite often to figure out what to do. Dont even bother trying to read half of the research descriptions. That aside, it IS Early Access, so i understand its not a polished and finished product. However for the playable state it is currently in, i am genuinely impressed. Ive played more EAG's (early access games) and there are much much much worse ones out there.

[h1]@Youthcat Studios:[/h1]
[b]Love the game, but some customization would be nice like the following.[/b]
[list]
[*]Logistics: Set an amount to keep in stock and let the rest be distributed by drones. 
[*]Logistics: Trade routes. Let us set routes between specific interplanetary logistics stations so we dont get random pickups from other planets.
[*]Tutorial/Tips: Please let us [b]TURN THEM OFF![/b] Not just important tips or necessary tips. OFF should be in the list as well. When you start a new game, you are forced to listen to them all again.
[*]Removing old/wrong conveyor belts is a chore. Please make it easier, because having to backtrace every incorrect belt with the mouse is really annoying. [b]EDIT. This is now fixed![/b]
[*]Graphics customization options. My graphics card is constantly running 60+ degrees even with fans on 100%. We need to be able to turn down some stuff! (yes my gpu is slightly outdated, GTX970). [b]EDIT. Still happening, same exact issue but now with a GTX3080![/b]
[/list]

[h1]TL:DR Version[/h1]
You like Satisfactory? Dont get this, you wont play Satisfactory anymore.
You like Factorio? Dont get this either, for the same reason.
You like Planetary Annihilation? Dont get this. Its the same, but without the combat and without the planet smashing :D

[b]Seriously, Get this game, discounted or not. Its worth the money even in its current state of development. If they are going to add more over time, this is going to be an amazing game![/b]

It seems the broken part of the saving system is confined to the autosave portion of it.  I turned off autosave and gave the game a second try.  Ten hours later and the problem has not recurred.  So I have changed my downvote to an upvote, with the warning that the autosave is broken, and on streaming services it must be disabled.  I also feel I should point out that autosave being broken in a game that is basically all about automation is rather ridiculous.  Lastly, I know the devs have fixing saves on their radar, so in case any of them read this:  THE PROBLEM IS IN THE AUTOSAVE.

Great game.  Unless you happen to play on a streaming service.  I play on GeForce Now, and the game's ability to save appears to be broken.  Cloud saves are out of the question, which the game kindly informs you of during load.  What it doesn't tell you is that autosaves and manual saves are equally broken.  I have repeatedly lost a half hour or more of progress.  I manually save the game, then shut it down to go make a sandwich or somesuch.  When I return, the game has inexplicably rolled back my progress.  It happens both when I just lazily click 'Continue', and also when I load a save manually.  Apparently there is some issue with the size of saves, which I have heard they intend to address but they don't know when.  It seems that whatever is amiss with the saves makes the whole saving system broken for streaming services.  

So if you intend to play the game on a streaming service, I would definitely NOT recommend this game.  And if you're planning to play it locally, I also wouldn't recommend it until they fix whatever is broken with saving.",1652573771,1652659632,True,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,True
