Story wise Gujian 3 is straight forward, no surprises on the ending and overall is ok but it could been better. 

Battle system is good and fluent, kind of remind me of dark soul but not at that difficulty. Battle system is better then Xuan Yuan 7 and sword & fairy 7 in my opinion.

Graphic is pretty good for a chinese game and music is good like most chinese games.

The not so good bit in my opinion is side quests, crafting and customise the land. Is a but repetitive and not so interesting in opinion.

About the Game: Too bad that it had to end at some point. So far 10/10 i loved it!!!

- there is no real ending to those great characters including the mc (tbh i would like to know what happens after the story ends) i hope we get a gujian 4 with the same characters

Gameplay is actually pretty engaging, Lots stuff to do, like witcher but simplified. Combat is good too, there's parries, skills, guard cancel, pretty good particles and vfx. I just feel that there are so much things in screen when are 3 or more enemies, because u have a reticle that shows when a enemy will do a skill/special move, if it's red it's unblockable, and when its yellow you can cancel it doing a skill or parrying. Thing is there are so many enemies that the reticle is showing everywhere and you can't really know what you are doing, it should be notifiying up the enemy and not in the reticle (like sekiro), but this is just subjective.

Graphically is beautiful. Every corner is worth of painting. In town I barely get 40 fps from a gtx 1070 and a Ryzen 1400 but yeah is not like I have the latest hardware and I have all maxed out except the AA.

2023.08.08更新
时隔两年半，经历完考研二战，我才有空开始二周目，并更新这段评测。
我并不打算赋予古剑三“国产之光”的头衔，但我可以说它是一款优质的国产游戏，我相信这个评价是中肯的，尤其与在此之后发售的同类型风格的国产游戏相比，例如紫塞秋风、轩辕剑七和仙剑七等，古剑三相较而言更胜一筹。
先说缺点：1、战斗动作系统有待进一步提升完善，尤其是防反机制，和战斗的融合度不高，更多时候玩家用的是闪避。2、家园系统种植采矿等耗时有点多，不能较好地和主线剧情推进配合。3、或许因为经费有限的原因，许多重要剧情和伏笔没能做出来，例如我很希望有一个岑缨和小叔子见面互动的剧情。3、任务系统未能完成的支线会一直挂在那里，强迫症玩家会有些难受。

wrapped around in a beautifully designed game with fantastic music and overwhelming lore and culture = you get Gujian3

It's tough to recommend RPG with a couple of wondrous moments and frustrating decisions. 
I think this will leave gamers confused and push them to drop Gujian3 midway through.
The translation is rough to follow because it has various names and wrongly worded sentences that will make you guess in places unless you check the in-game lore book, which, thankfully, keeps count of the chapters and the events within.
It's a beautiful, looking game with a nice way of showing Chinese mythology. It's like you're walking in their cities, forests, and mountains.

Plot without major spoilers:
You play as Beiluo, a highly skilled swordsman raised by a family of martial artists. Beiluo is a ""fey"" - a powerful creature from the spirit world, who happens to be the twin brother of a King whose life is about to end.
Beiluo has to become the new King and sort out the mystery of demons invading the Spirit and Mortal realms.
You'll travel through many beautiful vistas: deserts, snowy mountains, forests, and more while exploring this gorgeous world.
Throughout his adventure, you'll encounter plenty of characters with their own personality and fighting styles, from spirit creatures to mortal allies.
Because of this, a lot of the plot will get confusing and fast... the rough translation doesn't help either, but even if you miss a couple of details, you'll understand what's going on by the end.
It's not the best story and doesn't reach the level of The Witcher or Red Dead Redemption, but it brings an intriguing plot with scenes, that are funny, sad, and epic.

Gameplay:
It's highly repetitive, with a lack of variety from enemies, not in design but in their attacks.
The abilities you unlock are satisfying, but you'll end up fighting lots of bosses that are sponge machines which can get pretty tiresome after a while.
There's a main quest, plenty of side quests, and side activities with a bunch of mini-games, like fishing.

As you progress through the story, you'll unlock a hub area where you can upgrade your weapons, and armor, and unlock new skins and appearance options for your swords and clothes. 
You can build a house and design the area to your taste. 
You can collect spirits and humans, which can work for you. These can then be sent on missions to collect materials. 
You can plant and farm.
All of this is superficially done, and it's more of a window-dressing to extend the length of the game. 

The negatives:
- You must be online in order to play it;
- Some of the side quests feel ripped off from an MMORPG.  
e.g: Collect a few plants, beat 5 monkeys, bring a healing salve to an old lady, etc.;
- Combat gets stale and frustrating. Crafting upgrades for your weapons helps, and it's a must unless you want to wack monsters endlessly;

If you stick with it, you'll get a wholesome story, that's quite different from your typical Western or Eastern RPGs, with great character development and a big cast of interesting personas in a beautifully fantasy-like crafted world.

There are many cutscenes in the game. Sometimes you'll walk back to a previous area, watch a short cutscene, then move back to where you're supposed to go. You can watch the entire game on Youtube, but if you found anything intriguing above, you may like to experience it yourself. Set your expectations accordingly that you're not signing up for a ""perfect experience"" but an ""artistic"" one.

The characters are memorable and you get attached to them. The gameplay is great! I really did not want this game to end. I wanted to be a part of this  beautiful and detailed world. Beiluo, Yun Wu Yue, Cen Ying and Wuzhou are such interesting characters, I really wanted to find out what happened to them. I hope that maybe one day, Aurogon will make a continuation of their story line. The end credits give vague ideas about the protagonists but nothing of Wuzhou who although you defeat him as the final boss, the game story gives you reason to believe he is not really dead. Oh and there is base building and minigames! The locations are awesome and there is one chinese shadow puppet level that is just bonkers! The game fight mechanics are fluid and challenging but fun.

The game is not perfect. There were a few bones I had to pick. The tuning of the difficulty of some of the bosses was ridiculous. The first boss you meet in the prequel really was one of the hardest in the game simply because of the time restriction you had while fighting. That fight should have been later in the game. The subtitles were fine. I know some people really hate subtitles but I thought they were fine. The only problem was that important plot points would trigger while you were in the middle of a punishing battle. You can't pause the text and you would not have time to read the subtitles while you were fighting. You can easily miss important plot points this way which makes the story much harder to follow. My third beef was with the base building UI. It was soooo tedious! It drove me nuts. This is not the main game UI, but a UI for the lotus seed you get a third of the way through the game. This black lotus seed becomes your ""home base"" and you can upgrade it, and recruit workers to mine resources for you while you are out adventuring. It really is a nice little base building mechanic but moving around the UI is exhausting even to make simple items. Also, why can't I go in the dang house I built for myself?! I can just LOOK at it! Most of the minigames were good. I didn't care for the card game though. I found it difficult to understand and I wound up picking cards randomly until I won. 

I liked the ending credits which showcases many of the wonderful inventions that China has produced over time that have greatly contributed to our world, but i found it strange that it focused on what happened to Cen Ying after the events of the game. It wasn't her story! It was Beliou's story! I wanted to know what happened to him! I feel like the game overall ended a bit abruptly. I almost felt like, the ending wasn't really where the developers wanted to end the game but had to put a period on it and found a place to do it. Maybe they had originally planned to have DLC for it that would round out the story more and tell us what happened to the Shadow Chasers, the Demons and the rest of the Fey. What happened to Wuzhou's bird? What happened to Wuzhou? I wanted to see how the relationship between the Dreamhaunt YunWuYei and Beiluo continued to develop and wanted to know more about the people who lived in the dream world. There was sooo much material that would have been great in a DLC. How Beilou transitions the kingdom to his brother's children. A plot involving the Demons where we get to see their side of the story. The Fey world is so vast, the developers could have done anything! I really hope there will be a Gujian 4!

Overall, Gujian 3 or Swords of Legends 3 as it also known, is a wonderful masterpiece of a game. If you like Final Fantasy, the Witcher series, action RPGs in general or are a fan of the xianxia genre, do yourself a favor and get this game!",1685405484,1685405598,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I heard about it thanks to an artist on Twitter - the one who drew the work of art I now use as my profile picture. 
At first, I didn't know anything about it and I'd started it because of the amazing fanarts I got to see about it. 
Truth be told, I fell in love right at the beginning. The music, the sceneries, the fights, the characters, the very first city itself. Everything was absolutely mesmerizing and I just ended up almost crying when I finished the game because I didn't want it to end, although I was very happy with how it did end.

The story was amazing, well written, the characters and their growth were as amazing, and if anything, I was a bit laid back by the gameplay at first because of how unusual it felt to me but really, I got through the end of it and I never felt like giving up on it. 

However, I had around 1k screenshots at the end of my first walkthrough lmao, the game is beautiful and I bought the OST because I couldn't get enough, I even went looking for merch because realy, Gujian3 and its devs deserve SO MUCH MORE than what it costs at the moment.

I bought this game on sale and am very happy I took the plunge. The game is a grandiose rpg filled with handsome swordsmen (and beautiful women), immortal beings, beasts and creatures. A game infused with ancient Chinese folklore, some directly inspired by Chinese mythology. The voice overs are in Chinese but honestly done beautifully (I found I was more immersed in the game with the authentic language being spoken and sub-titles on for understanding). 

The combat shines in this game too. You want to feel like a sword welding demi-God bada** then you've come to the right game. Lots of sword attacks, fatal combos, and powerful magics. Need a break? Then you can craft, fish, do side quests and even building up your settlement. 

* Update on building your settlement- This can be quite the grind. But you can find people & monsters out in the world to recruit and hire to run your settlement for you. It is not so much base building as building up your settlement the assets like farm plots, chicken coops, carpentry, mining etc. I do like this aspect to the game but as stated it can be a grind to get it up and going. Plus you need to keep your workers fed and happy which can break the immersion of the game sometimes when your just in the mood to travel the world, fight and continue the story.

It is slow to start, it's one of those you start with an ""everything"" character only to end up with your real character that only has 1 move after about an hour in....but that is where the game starts to come alive.

theres a block system and perfect block/counter system.

stamina and dodge

moves you gain points while attacking you gain access to kinda like a pirate warriors .

multiple combos with light and heavy attacks

play the game on the hardest difficulty or its ff15 easy.

I also read a loooot of Chinese light novels (CD, NSHBA, MGA, ATG, ISSTH, etc.) so I really wanted to play a C-RPG and it hit that spot for me while waiting for the next chapters to come out. But there are both pros and cons to the game and at this point, the cons are just too much to justify further play. 

PROS
-artwork is mesmerizing.
-plot seems really cool so far. I want to know more about each and every one of the characters both in your party as well as the main antagonist, Wuzhao
-interesting enemies, strategy is needed to a certain extent as well as situational awareness 

CONS
-you can really feel the limits of the world. While happily exploring, you often run into the invisible wall even though you have an object that lights up right in front of you. wtf. 
-I've died more times from jumping than from actual combat. Like seriously why is the jumping mechanic so janky?
-the menu is a disaster. This is the real reason I'm stopping. 
-combat feels slow despite all the stuff that's playing out on screen. Shield break never seems to work either so welp. 
-it's hard to find things. you can use LT to scan the world around you, but objects hidden in foliage still get missed even after they light up. Obviously not an issue in the Nameless Depths, but in towns/forests, etc it just becomes tedious completing side quests 
-can't change the sensitivity of the camera. I kinda just got used to this one, but it's stupid. There should be a menu option to allow this
-cut scenes for days. Of the 50 hours I've spent playing, probably 20 of those are not actual playing, but cut scene following but walking to (you guessed it) another cut scene.",1680037238,1680037238,False,14,0,0.558918237686157227,0,True,False,False

994280,131373313,76561198073105284,0,6,6671,0,6671,1674425538,"A hidden gem among Action RPG games.  Finished the game in 111 hours including the main story, side quests, and optional crafting stuffs. Definitely recommend this game. Overall better than Sword and Fairy 7 of the same price in the same genre.

[h1] STORY [/h1]
The story was rich spanning aeons of conflict in a world consisted of mortals, beasts, demons, feys, ghosts, and spirits. There were some emotional moment where it hits me hard, and every character including the enemies were extremely memorable especially due to the tragedic nature of each story arc. The world building was well crafted through the carefully scripted story telling of each character that is threaded with stories of ancient Chinese civilization. Every little detail adds up to this grand adventure that would leave you wanting for more. The cutscenes are well animated with good scripting. I played the game with Chinese texts and VOs - cannot comment on the English setting. 9/10.

[h1] COMBAT [/h1]
The combat system was easy to get into with keyboard and mouse. I did not try controller, but the developer supposedly recommend using controller as well. The combat revolves around light and heavy attacks, dodge, guard, and combat skills, that when combined together presents a very fluid and pleasant combat dynamic.  There are also teammate and pact skills that can make the combat even more engaging.  Dodging and guarding consume stamina like Soul games.  Combat skills require the spending of ""energy"" bars (up to 3) which can be filled up with regular attacks.  The enemies definitely pack some serious punches as you start the game even on normal difficulty mode.  Carefully studying the movement pattern of enemy bosses and trash mobs is important.  The game does the story telling from the view point of different characters at different places and different times, so the character you control switches at times.  However, most of the game is played as the ""main"" male protagonist, often accompanied by up to 3 other NPC allies.  You can customize the ""main"" character's combat skills (up to 4), your NPC allies' teammate skills (1 on-demand and 1 AI assisted per NPC), as well as pact skills (up to 4 on-demand) from friendly beasts/feys/spirits you form pact with.  Some bosses are more difficult than others. Stocking up on potions can help.  8/10.

[h1] CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION [/h1]
As a typical RPG game, you gain more stats like HP, ATK, DEF as your character levels up. All NPC allies share the same EXP.  Combat and teammate skills are acquired by selecting skills points in the Constellation system, which allows for potentially different playstyles in combat. There are passive stats/abilities and various combat skills to choose from.  Many skills are locked behind other skills.  The main character also has a ""super saiyan"" mode that gain access to another set of combat skills. There are also pact skills.  Throughout the game, as you defeat specific mini-bosses, you can form a pact with them and therefore gain pact skills.  These pact skills summon them to do healing, fill up energy bars, and do line/AOE damages with CC effects.  All these customizations make the combat an unique and fun experience.  In addition, you can upgrade the main character and NPC allies' weapons with special materials you gain from defeating monsters.  Weapon and accessories have additional slots to equip ""runes"" / ""gems"" to grant more bonus and effects.  You can also customize the looks of each character through accessories and costumes. 9/10.

[h1] GATHERING & CRAFTING [/h1]
Later in the game, you gain access to a ""home"" base area.  The ""home"" base allows fishing, mining, exploration, farming and crafting. Fishing, mining, and exploration can be done by sending beasts/feys/spirits under pact out to gather materials. This is a very interesting addition, which is often found in MMORPG. Most of these activities are optional and can be ignored. I did enjoy this feature which grants some QoL improvement in material gathering to help craft useful items. The most useful things to unlock and craft are potions, armours, and runes/gems, which will make boss fighting easier. You can also craft weapon skins, accessories, and costumes to change the appearance of each character. Having said that, some may find the ""home"" base activities a chore. 8/10.

[h1] MINI-GAMES & PUZZLES [/h1]
Guijian 3 has a card mini-game.  It's a combo-matching game where picking up certain pair or combination of cards gives you extra points. You can skip this optional content, though I did enjoy it.  The ""home"" base has a few levels of instanced platform mini-games that are optional.  It's important to note that there are jumping and platform navigation puzzles deeply rooted throughout the entire game.  An early dungeon zone presents you an immediate challenge in this aspect.  I fell off and died here multiple times initially.  It also took some thinking to figure out how to navigate through the dungeon. Even in neutral towns, there are loots hidden on roof tops, etc, that would require solving jumping puzzles.  There is another pattern recognition mini-puzzle played to unlock special lootboxes sealed by ""magic"".  These loots do not make or break the game, but often offer good rewards.  For how the whole game is basically one long enjoyable puzzle with just the right balance of fun and difficulty, I would rate this category a 9/10.

[h1] GRAPHICS [/h1]
This game was made in 2018 but has better graphics than Sword and Fairy 7 which was made in 2021. Both games are Chinese Action RPG in the high fantasy (Xian Xia) category, but this game has much better texture details for the character models and the surrounding world.  The game runs quite smooth on MAX settings on my Legion 5 Pro with GTX 3070, so it's well optimized.  There were occasionally ground texture pop-in due to delayed rendering, but it wasn't too bad.  The facial expressions during cutscenes are okay, but nothing spectacular like FF7R.  Mini-dialogues in town that do not have cutscenes show no facial expression though.  8/10.

[h1] SOUND TRACKS [/h1]
The game has a lot of oriental sound tracks, fitting to each of the zones. There are however no epic ones that can compare to the Final Fantasy series.  Most of the sound tracks are soothing and calming, some give you a sense of urgency or despair. 7/10.

[h1] CLOSING REMARK [/h1]
If you are looking for a solid ARPG game with a beautifully constructed world and lots of story telling, as well as fluid and engaging combat, then this could be the game for you. To appreciate the overall story better, you would need to pay attention to all the dialogues during cutscenes and the mini-dialogues during zone navigation. I do not know the quality of the English localization though, as I played in 100% Chinese. The game developer definitely placed their hearts and souls into making this game. Be pleasantly surprised when you get to the ""Dragon Palace"" area. =)  Considering the enjoyment for the relatively cheap price, I would give it an overall 8.5/10.

[h1] EXTRA NOTES [/h1]
The game has Always-on DRM to prevent piracy, which is a big issue in China. This can be a turn-off for some western players. The save files are also stored on the Cloud server. There are actually two Cloud servers, one in China and one in Global region. Right clicking on the Steam tray icon to launch Gujian 3 will default you to the China one. Launching the game from the Library section allow you to choose which server to play on. I ended up defaulting to the China Cloud server, which did not cause any issue for my playthrough.

1. Good looking environment
2. Overall good looking models despite some awkward facial animations
3. Flashy combat that sometimes can feel satisfying
4. Interesting story

Now onto its problems:
1. Very poor level design - HUGE maps with mostly empty things.
2. Very shallow combat system - All your attacks are either single target or AOE hits. Sometimes you get some special effects but you only get to equip 4 moves. 
3. Extremely annoying camera - the game forces you to do platforming with very poor jumping animation and annoying camera. Your camera clip into your character model making you impossible to see. This in combination with unexpected invisible walls makes the game very annoying to navigate. 
4. Tries to have too many popular game mechanics and bad at all of them - You get quick actions that you never lose, platforming with bad jump animation + unexpected invisible walls, shallow RPG system where all skills eventually look and feel the same, you get stamina system that doesn't matter much, you boss fights that forces you to miss etc so it's ""staged"".

No not objectively, it is fun, has good characters, has a good story and great looking environments. My issue with it is that it's BARELY a game and yet for some indescribable reason everyone talks about it like it is even a game. There's basically no customization options in reality because you get items/weapons that are just straight upgrades progressively. For example you can't say buy a level 20 weapon in the first couple areas when you're level 10 even through grinding; you get the level 20 weapon when the game says ""okay here's a level 20 area, here's gear to scale you up"". 

This is moreso a movie/web series with tiny sprinkles of gameplay than a RPG, and even then sometimes the cutscenes/movie portion can be janky. You'll have enemies spawn in dramatically with no sound effects, only a step above T-posing. Minigames come and go and are only there for a specific area, and there's no depth to any system in the game, not even the combat. You unlock skills sure but it's again so obvious that this new skill is better than the old one, there's no reason not to switch as it's both stronger and flashier.",1671313142,1671313142,False,1,0,0.45378151535987854,0,True,False,False

  And there's also some slight humor and jokes in the game also which is nice.
 But one of the best things about this game is it's character progression, I love seeing the main character (and also side characters) grow throughout the story mentally and power wise and it's very prominent in this rpg.   

  Overall, I'd say this is hands down one of the best rpg's I've ever played and It rivals even 
Trails of Cold Steel for what it is.
At least, If your into this kind of game at least.

  Edit - Finished the game! And I've got to say, well done! 

  Incredible action scenes, but the animation in the cutscenes could be a little better. Story kept on throughout the whole game too, although you have to go through more than 3 backstory gameplay sequences it still managed to pump more twists and turns out and keep up. 

  Last but not least the ending... Mmmm, well of course i'm not gonna spoil but the only thing I can think of to say is that this game could have used at least 30 to 40 more hours and instead of having side characters be the only ones seen at the end, end it with Beiluo and Yun'wuyue back at the shadowchaser kingdom with Beiluo being the king.

  Conclusion - Incredibly beautiful and compelling story and characters with amazing amounts of great character progression and it supplements all that with crazy good cutscenes, although they could use better animation. All in all I would love to forget all about it and play through it again without knowing anything but sadly that's impossible lol, it's too bad the game was cut short for some reason and ended prematurely but it's still godly for what it is.

  If you have, then thank you for reading thus far and for doing so I will try to give you some recommendations! Take a look below and check these games out, if I had more time I would put more recommendations but I don't, so sorry.

  Recommendations - I'f you're looking for a Chinese rpg somewhat similar to Gujian 3 try checking out Xuan-Yuan Sword 7, it is on Steam and comes out near the end of October of 2020. 
  Until then try the papa of Xuan-Yuan Sword 7, Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Gate of Firmament, although i'm not sure whether XYS7 has action combat or not XYS: TGOF has real time turn based combat. 
  
  And another good game that also has a fan translation is a game called Fate Seeker which is a semi top down / 3d martial arts action rpg which is focused on exploration and quests and is pretty fun to be honest, the link to the Fate Seeker fan translation / patch is here -https://steamcommunity.com/app/882790/discussions/0/4540134453710252542/

  There is ever more in this large mind of mine good people! There is also a lesser known Chinese rpg that, sadly, is pure turn based combat and the Steam name for it is -
鸿源战纪 - Tales of Hongyuan, and it's one of the rare few semi top down / 3d Chinese rpgs that use a more realistic art style and some people may not like it and personally i'm one of those people because cartoony / anime art style I think is more easy on the eyes but to each they're own. 

  Found more since I first posted this review, this one is called Path of Wuxia, it is a game made by the company who made Tale of Wuxia.
  Both have turn based combat but Path of Wuxia certainly has great combat and not to mention the story, the story and character are the best things about it and god can the story get dark real fast. 
  
  Keep in mind you can choose your gender in Path of Wuxia.
 In the beginning you are a commoner but eventually get mixed up in some bad stuff, after being saved you go to your saviors martial arts school to train with them and many others to get ready for whats ahead in life.
  
  Eventually you have to start making choices on whether you kill your enemies or save them/let them live and find out making it in life has choices harder than it did when you were in that small country village.
  One of the main plot points and systems of Path of Wuxia is basically just a mentality standpoint between killing your enemies and letting them live upon more difficult choices along the way as well, the characters and story will change based on your choices of doing either as well as choices in general. 
  
 There are multiple romance options and it effects the ending of the game as well, and the game has an English translation for all of it so you can actually know what's happening.   
 The English translation stops being well translated at the 3rd in game year (The game is based on a yearly system) but the community is working harder and harder to pump more updates for the English patch out so that will be fixed eventually. 
  
 The English patch for Path of Wuxia can be found at the patch makers Discord channel, here is the link for that - https://discord.gg/MStM9sE4 
  
  All you have to do is follow the instructions at the two tabs called #download and
#engmod-release-notes. 
  If you don't know what to do still or are having trouble or issues of any kind ask anyone in the Discord for help in the #troubleshooting tab. 
  The people in the Discord channel are really chill and like to talk about the game, they will help you as best they can.

Plot 4/5 (ending is meh)
Combat 4/5 (Rounding up, it's very grindy and honestly the skills are kinda useless).
Gameplay 3/5, the adventuring design is very tedious, monsters are very grindy, and there is a lot of traversal after fast traveling.

Overall 16/20.

I recommend it, it's about 35-40% cutscene though so get ready to watch a very long movie with short bursts of interactions.  There's a lot of reading, the translation is mediocre (I played it in Chinese).  

I recommend going through this game with a trainer tbh, it makes a lot of the grind a bit better and palatable.  The move speed is quite slow, and you have a stamina bar which when depleted means you can't dash/run so you move like a snail.

I played it in Chinese but I will leave an English review since there are plenty of Chinese reviews already. I've played this game from the start three times now and all three times I've given up somewhere. I really thought to give it another chance but got disappointed once again.

This game has all the basic blocks of a great game, but some design issues hold it back and make it unpleasant. Combat feels good at first, until it doesn't. Blocking just drains way too much stamina to be useful, enemies are able to take too much punishment it is a chore to fight them. Something about the combat just doesn't feel right. Maps are often poorly laid out and overly large, and often difficult to navigate.

Cutscenes and voice acting are nice and well done, that I can at least appreciate. But when the main gameplay element is combat, and you feel like combat is a chore you are made to get through in order to watch the cutscenes and follow the story, then something is seriously wrong.

The fishing minigame and card minigame are fun. I hope the developers polish up their combat design and balancing more, improve their map design a little. I look forward to their next game.",1647171567,1664892987,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You kill a bunch of ""demons"" then get asked to return back to the city to complete what I assume was the first quest.  Upon starting this return journey you keep running into groups of the same demons over and over and it quickly becomes boring.  You then get thrown into a boss fight which I felt very random since there's been literally zero story to explain wth is happening and this is all before you actually get back to the city to complete the first quest.  For me it just felt like a game where if you want to randomly kill the same demons and junk over and over ad nauseum then yeah sure you might like this cos as I said the combat is great and it is very pretty.

In my first 3 hours..... they literally throw you in as this king dude, no hand holding here as you are just YEETED into the combat with a few enemies then BAM! Your fighting something the size of a monster from something like the god of war series, a rather tough boss fight but they give you plenty of healing items for it. 

And then your playing as the kings twin brother, which he will be the main character.

After that I talked to some magical chipmunk for some reason and learned how to fish in a very easy button mashing mini-game.

Soon when you know it your king brother shortly dies thus forcing you to be his next heir despite literally knowing nothing about your brother and this is more or less where the game actually starts when all hell breaks loose with all the demons invading the city shortly after the kings death. 

This is very much an RPG with side quests with loot to do and gradually unlock stuff as you progress the game. There is also a ton of talking, so be prepared for reading. So you know if your into some of that stuff, then your going to enjoy this.",1664009200,1664009200,True,5,3,0.563145339488983154,0,True,False,False

This game was [i]such[/i] a pleasant surprise. I had this on my wishlist for quite some time and had waited for a good sale so I could buy it. This whole time I already was very eager on playing it, having read reviews and looked at the store page. So when summer sale came around and they sold Gujian 3 for roughly 8 bucks, I HAD to buy it. That was one of the best decisions in my life. It is definitely worth the full price though too.

First of all, let me say that the reviews for this game are pretty accurate. It's an Action RPG that is heavily based on the story, which means you'll go through a lot of hours of cutscenes. The fighting system is not too complex and battles maybe take up 45% of the game in total (if you don't linger too much on side quests or farming). So to get this out of the way: If you want to play this because of a very refined and complicated fighting system, then this game probably is not for you. Instead, if you pay a lot of attention to characters, stories and visuals, it is perfect for you. If you're interested in the Wuxia theme (aka. Chinese setting and history/ambience) on top of that, you just found YOUR game.

Well, with this out of the way, let me actually get deeper into this review. If you haven't noticed by now: I [i]LOVE[/i] this game. There was not one part that I disliked. It is a very well-rounded package overall. Which actually makes this really hard for me to write because I don't know where to start.

Firstly, let me say that the music was utterly fitting and congenial. It underlined the various parts of the game in such a nice way that let you engage in the story even more.

Now let's talk about the graphics, since this is not too complex to discuss. If you couldn't already tell from the screenshots, Gujian 3 is an absolutely stunning game. This does not only go for the cutscenes but everything in-game too. I enjoyed exploring the areas in this game so much. The lighting was beautiful and created a fitting atmosphere, the quality of the environment was very nice to look at and the designs. My god, the designs. I might not be the most professional person to rate this but I loved how wonderful the world was designed. Maybe the fact that the Wuxia theme was new to me also played a role here but just looking at the woods, the mountains and the cities in this game was satisfying. Especially Skyelk had such an interesting and gorgeous design as a city. Every time I got to discover a new area I ran around for at least half an hour, taking as many details in as possible. I always had one finger on the screenshot button and played around with the camera angles, simply because this game was a treat for the eyes.

Let's move over to the character designs. I really liked their clothes, since every piece seemed to fit their character very well. Sometimes I felt like the colors hinted at something or certain ways of dressing oneself did. Furthermore, the facial features, hairstyles, posture and personal ways of carrying oneself created extremely realistic characters. They seemed to all have their own quirks and personality. As for the latter one... Wow. All of the main cast and even some of the side characters went through such a nice development, you could easily see how much they changed over the course of the game. I promise you, play Gujian 3 for yourself and you will understand what I am talking about. I loved all three [spoiler](technically four)[/spoiler] main characters because their dynamic was great and their interactions were interesting to watch. Also, the way they evolved together as a group [b]and[/b] as individuals was heartwarming to witness.

The next point I would like to mention is the story. It probably is the most crucial thing in this game (next to character development) and it is definitely worth your time. It unfolds quest after quest and there are small twists I didn't expect. It really showed me how intriguing the Wuxia theme can be and how much I enjoy it. The story is very well paced and it's great that you have some kind of ""diary"" in your menu with many entries regarding characters, monsters, world-building, the quests etc. . I loved reading through these every time something new appeared. You can see how complex the world of Gujian 3 really is.

Lastly, I would also like to point out that the addition of the Lotuscape was a nice idea with a few enjyoable minigames. This is probably where I spent the least amount of time but that doesn't mean I disliked it. It was a cute idea and fit in very well with the rest of the game.

Since I don't have a lot of space to write this review, I will end it with this. After 68 hours, I finished my first playthrough and was overwhelmed. Gujian 3 was an extraordinary and amazing experience that I will forever keep close to my heart. I learned and grew alongside the characters and this is the only game so far, which caused me to tear up a little because I didn't want it to end. So congrats on that Gujian 3. And thank you [i]SO MUCH[/i] for this irreplaceable experience.",1595399917,1662055327,True,59,0,0.836569309234619141,3,True,False,False

It has everything. Even at low graphics the quality is good and the performance is better that way for me as my rig is pretty old. The storyline is legitimately amazing. There are so many different aspects. There are things you actually won't be able to guess at. 

After playing for hours you'll open up your own world which you can build in, customize, and craft things to aid your adventures and to make money. The best thing to do with your money? Spend it on ingredients so you can craft more stuff to help with your adventure.

This game has everything that makes an excellent single player RPG. I've been searching for something like this for ages and it really is exactly what I was hoping for. I will make an effort to complete this game 100%. It's worth it. If you're on the fence, go ahead and buy it cause you won't regret it.

The combat is good and responsive, the level design is awesome. Graphics are good too. As long as you're ok with subtitles and you like action rpgs, I say get it. 
I tried sword and fairy 7 before this and gujian 3 has the better combat. Sword and fairy 7 has the newer engine and everything, but gujian 3 is damn good so far. The combat is more responsive than sword and fairy 7 right off the bat. The platforming threw me. It's impressive what they did with the engine. You're jumping onto floating pieces of destroyed building and some of them will move once you hop on. 
The story so far is good. You play a portion in the beginning as one character with full abilities and then you play as another that has 1, but it doesn't really feel weaker, just less options starting. It's not open world. I dunno why people are so upset about that as there are tons of games that come out still and aren't open world. I'm thankful for the structure to the game. Open world was cool when I was younger, but now I just want to get to it. Plus almost all open world games are the assassins creed approach that's just been done to death.

As of this writing, I haven't put very many hours into this underrated gem. But allow this first impression to express how much I look forward to further exploring and completing this game. The calm and measured voice acting delivery is distinct from what one might expect from a Western or Japanese game. The combat, while nothing to boast about, is fluid and engaging. The villages and locales are populated with just enough NPCs and background dialogue to make them feel vibrant. The story has yet to develop, but I'm getting more interested as I go.

The game will be dead , save files will be lost , and it'd be all your fault . For implimenting sh-t drm just to stop cheating in a single player rpg. Fix the damn game. 

First, if your expecting a game that's offline , allows you to save as you please, and has western servers. This game has none of that. Second,  this game has only chinese servers. Meaning, so many frame drops, disconnection issues, and prethera ammount of bugs. Because, chinese laws and the lack of bug testing.

 Have a laptop that you use a usb mouse, usb hard drive (for storgae of ready boost), and only have 1 usb left that you use for a controller of your choice ? Well if you do use a controller. You cant press f3 to save your game. That's right you can not save your game with a controller. All you get is a temporary save option in the start menu . :/ You dont even have the option to save to sub saves like in many other mmorpgs or rpg games . Meaning, your saves are fucked if you use a controller . 

 So if you enjoy your Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo controller. Unless, its completely bluetooth to allow you to use a keyboard in the 3rd usb slot. Gujin 3 will not give you an option to save your game .  So thats a serious F--k up move on the devs end . 

 If you think you can back up your saves . You can't . It's all done on the server end of things making preservation of your game save nearly impossible. Unless, Steam can make a copy for you . 

 I have ran into well over 80 game crashing bugs. Before, the end of the prologue tutorial . This game is not worth the base $30 the game normally ask for. $5 maybe . But, when the servers go down you no longer have a game to play . So , just go pirate the game. Since, you dont even get to play it offline anyway . Unlike other mmorpg games .

[b]Good: [/b]
- Price is extremely worth it. The gameplay experience is easily better than most AAA games out there. 
- Graphic is incredibly awesome. Every scene is wallpaper quality, with detailed texture and shading. 
- Music is eargasm. Just like the Witcher 3, different area and even cut scenes have their respective distinguishable music. 
- Gameplay is fluid. No lags, no frame drops, no stutter. 
- Mechanics and controls are straightforward. Tutorials are brief but clear, in the sense that it doesn't treat us like 5 year olds who never touched a controller before. 
- Minimal grinding. On normal difficulty, there isn't any progress walls which requires farming for RNG drops.
- Storyline and lore - You should be able to understand and appreciate even if you don't speak Chinese.
- Every area is visually different. You can tell that the developers put in significant effort on the planning and execution, instead of copy and pasting everything (like despicable Ubisoft). 
- There is a farming simulator, which caught me by surprise. It's so cute and relaxing! So it's part of the story but not mandatory so you can ignore it if you don't enjoy it.
- Voice acting (in Chinese) is bearable. At least it doesn't feel like the actors are reading a script at gun point.
- English translation is decent. There's some spelling, grammatical and translation errors but nothing game-breaking. 
- No micro transactions and cash grab DLCs. You pay for a full game, you get a full game.

[b]Bad: [/b]
- Battles are a button mashing fest to see who wins the game of attrition.
- Most side quests are one dimensional and not rewarding. To elaborate, you simply need to go from point A to point B to do something, for a reward that is insignificant to the main storyline.
- Card game is boring and mindless, with no strategy required.
- Story is linear. Things happen that way because the plot says so. 
- No replayable value after you beat the game, unless you really care about those worthless steam trophies.
- Despite being a single player game, you cannot play this game in offline mode. I understand that this is a piracy prevention measure, but it's causing inconvenience to players that bought this game legally. Fortunately the servers are not entirely garbage. I had trouble saving on a few occasions but nothing gets on my nerve so far. 

[b]Conclusion: [/b]
This game is a masterpiece which I highly recommend to players who enjoy story rich RPGs, hack and slash, or open world games. It is obvious that the developers had put in massive effort in the every single aspect to produce such a breathtaking work of art. Despite being a 2018 game, the quality is far superior as compared to most try-hard games out there.

 游戏对于玩家而言，都是萝卜白菜各有所爱，只有喜不喜欢和适不适合，《古剑奇谭三》这个游戏明眼人就能看出来制作组到底用没用心，那些上来说《古剑三》是个垃圾游戏的，大可不必。总共3000多万的制作费用在2018年做到这种程度，不可能所有的玩法都能兼顾做的很好，剧情一直都是古剑的强项，自然是要把资金放在擅长的地方，而且《古剑三》从来都没有买过什么水军，官方也从来没说过是国产之光，宣发费用几乎都没有，哪来的钱买水军？买水军买的最开心的大家也知道会是什么样的游戏，古剑永远都是靠着“同行衬托”。《古剑三》本身确实也有很多缺点，觉得影响到游戏体验的，可以提出来，拿出实质性的证据给官方反馈，我们作为粉丝也会很欢迎，但是上来除了开骂之外啥都没有，就不知道你买这游戏是为了啥。

I just finished it 5 minutes ago and honestly it makes me sad to see it go.

Just as a gist, the game is a mostly linear action adventure where you play as Beiluo, an ordinary swordsman with quite the secret. Due to certain events within the first thirty minutes or so of the game, he now has the responsibility of saving a kingdom from ruin. Thus begins the tale of our reluctant hero. The story falls under the xianxia category or Chinese high fantasy. If like me, you have read wuxia or xianxia, you will feel right at home.

The only thing that would hold it back from being considered AAA is the slightly wooden animation at times but aside from that this game is quite polished. The translation is alright. No literary work of art but professionally done and gets the story across quite well.

The game itself is somewhat linear. You have few hub areas where you can take quests, though these ones are mostly a source of money and nothing special. So unless you are really short on cash, you are free to avoid most of them. I say most because some of them are crafter quests which will definitely come in handy. You can run through certain areas you have visited before to collect resources and fight enemies for exp. The only way you get experience is through combat.

Now fair warning, the game is quite story heavy and does tell the story through cutscenes. The locations are beautiful and the music is very soothing and it draws you in like a book on a cool winter morning. It has a lot of philosophising and is very eastern in the values it talks about.

The different types of locations and enemy variety accompanying said locations put a lot of AAA games to shame. Of course you have your common deamons that look alike and they will be the main fodder of the game but different locations have different kinds of enemies. Heck you even fight in a painting in one quest.

Combat is pretty responsive. You can have 4 skills slotted along with 3 more team skills and 4 more additional skills from a certain something. You have your normal auto attacks, a dodge, a block/counter and your skills which can either be passive buffs or active attacks. Now countering does not give you I frames. This took a while for me to get used to.

Did I mention the locations? Because on some days I would just start the game and take a stroll through places, with the music accompanying me on my walk. It is just that good.

This game has a major drawback though. That being that you need to be always online to play it. It is a bit of a pain because it syncs your save with their servers or something, but even though there is no multiplayer I know of, you still need to be connected. A downer yes but the quality of the game make up for it.

As for minigames, you have fishing and a card game. The card game is basically trying to remember phrases and trying to get a card of that phrase and cards that combo with that phrase to score points. So its not as luck based as you would initially believe. Fishing is also pretty simple but its fun.

I can keep going but this post is long as it is. So I will stop here. Now excuse me while I go deal with story ending sadness.

Also do not skip the end credits. It's beautiful.",1643529507,1643529507,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I have barely played any so far as my play time probably reflects some idle time too but what I have played has been fun hack and slash. This game is beautiful too. I'm not a frame counter and don't pick on graphical faults but I don't recall noticing any lag, or gitter and the scenery and colour pallette are stunning.  

One word of warning is that this is Chinese and like Chinese films the subtitles seem to go much quicker than subs in other languages, so you need to read fast, or you miss it.

If you like ARPG's and a good looking game, then this should tick the boxes for you. 

It feels really polished to me so far.

For reference games of this type that I like are later end of Tales of (Zestiria and Berseria) and older Ys games like Felghana, Origin etc.  I think if these games float your boat, then so wil Gujian 3.

Like, seriously. Can I go at a speed faster than just mild jog in areas that are stupidly big but empty? Some areas are even worse where they put arbitrary ban on your 'run' so that you have to walk at a snail's pace to get through that area.

I can't go a minute without cut-scenes of some kind that has to be transitioned via loading screen, even in between battles of different phases of a boss it has to slap me with another loading screen.

It goes:
Open world -> Loading screen -> Scripted encounter -> loading screen -> battle arena -> loading screen -> scripted dialog -> loading screen -> open world

Optimization and background pre-loading? What's that, can I eat it?

This was amazing, now one of my favorite games I've ever played. Beautiful world building (including some incredibly creative set-piece designs), a slow-burn but immensely engaging story and characters, based on ancient Taoist mythology from China, with a beautiful theme of inheritance on both a large and individual scale: the inheritance of knowledge and progress from the distant past and how every person can contribute to it, but also the inheritance of loss and grief and personal grudges. It all comes together in a layered and quite complex story, crossing between the human world, dreamworld and spirit world, but it works and it draws you in completely. 

PRACTICAL TIPS in terms of game play (from my own experience at least): 

- Take the crafting and farming option seriously. Once you get the 'Lotusscape' feature (you won't miss it once you unlock it), invest time and effort into (gradually) increasing your workshop level and expanding especially your medicine supplies and your armor quality. This will very greatly improve your chances in the later boss fights and more difficult levels. There are also many side quests: some are simple fetch missions, but several of them lead to recruiting new craftspeople and this is really worth the time. (I also really started to enjoy my small-scale Lotusscape successes, with research and crafting). 

- At the halfway point, at the start of Act 3 there is a very difficult boss fight, which for me was by far the hardest fight in the game (I don't want to add spoilers, but it's impossible to miss). I would recommend to make sure you have the by then available highest level armor and accessories and spirit stones added before you start on Act 3 and plunge into this fight (because once it starts you can't go back to the Lotusscape or anywhere else, and you may get stuck if you can't defeat the demon, so you would have to return to an earlier save entry, and replay quite a chunk of the game as a result... If you keep upgrading the armor and accessories and weapons throughout Act 3 and 4 afterwards, the final boss fights will be easier to deal with as well.

- Sometimes the controls for jumping can be a bit tricky (I used controller). This only became an issue for me, though, in the 'Onyx kingdom' part. Here you have to make moving jumps and quickly navigate between moving parts that can knock you down. If you fail, you go back again to the very start of the 'runway', so to speak, and you have to start all over again. I made sure to do a manual save every time I got past an obstacle, so that if I got knocked down I could pick up again there, instead of having to start from scratch again. That made it a lot less frustrating for me, at least.

- I would add (as advice rather than practical tip): don't skip the dialogues. There can be quite a lot of exposition, entire parts of the character's history that are told by them, rather than shown in a cinematic, and all of it is in Chinese with subtitles. It requires some patience, but there is a very pleasant storytelling quality to it (or so I thought), and if you invest in listening to these parts, the many layers of the story will really draw together, throughout Acts 2 and 3 especially, and this for me really made the whole experience so memorable. I never got angry/frustrated about difficult parts or redoing an obstacle, or fetch-quests, because I was just so absorbed into the story and the game's atmosphere. And its main theme of 'inheritance', of the importance of working together, and the ancient legend of the Yellow Emperor also gave food for thought in a way that not many RPGs manage to do. (But you would miss all of that if you skip most of the dialogues...) 

In sum, I had incredibly much fun playing this game and at the same time it was also really quite profound, and the story and the characters were moving and engaging in a way that really made this game stand out for me. 10/10

Things i liked
- Some really pretty graphics at the start of the game
- combat enjoyable for the first few fights - combo mechanic is interesting
- Cute rat guy
- story starts off nicely

things i didn't like
- movement & map design. random parkours that add nothing to the game's experience except frustration. npcs that u have to follow move like snails. you can't jump onto some places that look like you can.
- gameplay is VERY not optimised. no easy way to access inventory, skills etc. no custom marker for maps. maps take ages to load in, and there's no option to go back to world map from area map. EXTREMELY frustrating when trying to look at the maps of different areas.
- boss fights become repetitive and rage inducing. they're not difficult, in fact you can just stand back and let the team do the work sometimes. its just not enjoyable. 10 hours in, all bosses feel the same - smack them until they attack, dodge, smack them again. no unique mechanics.
- story strays from its starting point. it becomes confusing and linear, no choices as of where i'm up to now - in fact theres barely any dialogue options.
- gwent > the card game in this game
- is 50gb
- i hate the cave areas, lighting is terrible, graphics aren't that good

[hr][/hr]
[u] Graphics [/u]

Nice and detailed models. Most importantly, my pc doesn't die while running it. It looks well optimized.
The enviroment is rich and well made, thou you can see glitches in the shadows at the distance sometimes.

I reach about 50FPS on average and dips of 20-30FPS when loading map or in a CPU intensive combat (with a lot of entities) with a midrange GPU.

[u] Cutscenes [/u]

I just love them. They are (or at least look like they are) made with the same game engine in real time, blending in nicely as you play.

Also, hope you like reading subtitles, because your are going to be reading them ...a lot.

[hr][/hr]
[u] Playability & controls [/u]

The tutorial is ""here, read this info cards"". Not the best idea as the game pauses in mid-fight read and 5 mins later you might not ever remember what it said.

The starting zone is made up so you can try and asimilate everything at your pace. If you are not ready, just wonder around until you feel comfortable.

A bit of input lag is present. It is noticible but not gamebreaking. It makes the game feel more like a console one.

[hr][/hr]

Stopped playing for about 6 month and can't remember the control scheme. It took me around half an hour to get acquainted with all the buttons and combinations againt. Not a game you can leave and take back whenever, you better make some time for frequent play sessions so don't forguet... how to play it.

[u] Combat [/u]

At least at the beggining, relies only in mashing two keys (Q and E) or the two mouse buttons depending on the playstyle you choose.

You are soon introduced to 4 habilities too, though is not very well explained how all of them work.

All fights end with a slow motion hit. It's a nice touch. Hope it doesn't get boring with time.

[hr][/hr]

[u] Language [/u]

Most likely you'll get the game in Chinise by default. Download Google Lens in your phone and use it in translate mode so you can change the UI and subtitles to English (If you want you, of course).

It is a bit frustrating at first. But since I managed to changed the language the experience was much better

[hr][/hr]

[u] Others [/u]

The only thing I really hate is that the game requires to be constantly connected to the servers, as everything is saved there. It's a solo game, you have to completely download but internet connection is needed, like genshin impact, but with no reason to require it.

It embeds the classic Chinese moral conflict of state duties vs. familial duties into a gradually unfolding tale. It is presented along multiple timelines intertwined into the story's 'present' timeline, which is done so naturally via the mythological settings. Roughly, the period is set in the first few thousand years of civilisation in Chinese mythology, when the Yellow Emperor built the first kingdom that united people under a common goal of human prosperity. There is a lot to explore lore wise, if one is interested in the theme.

The visuals are pleasantly conducive to the thematic setting. There is even one map where the environment is set on a Chinese opera stage! As far as I know, this is the first time such a method is deployed in a large-scale 3D story 'RPG' game. Artistically, it's quite impressive.

As for the gameplay, it's a fairly straightforward 3D action combat, with a simple stats and skill system that you'd eventually max out (more or less). The combat really depends more on your mechanics than on your skill tree. So the skill system feels less impactful. But that might not be a bad thing for some people. 

The 3D environment can be quite immersive, or frustratingly tedious, depending on your mood and perspective. Maps are large, perhaps a bit pointlessly large like in the early Baldur's Gate games. Although, this is mostly a peril for the first two chapters. The catacombs are very similar to that of Dark Souls – huge, dark, annoying. In later stages, you'd be moving between waypoints. This leads me to a definite minus for the game – the loading times can be long, and sometimes it feels as if you're spending half of your game time on the loading screen (the other half in cutscenes, jokingly speaking). Reducing the world complexity would be good. 

The English translations are great. And I must applaud the effort given how much dialogue with fairly cultural specific terms were there. 

The farming system is actually pretty addictive. Just don't let it distract you too much from the main storyline, or else you'd just end up playing a 3D Stardew Valley. 

Overall, the atmosphere of the game is fitting, and the music quite enjoyable too. Again, the story is the main feature of the game, and it's well written. The characters, although mythological, are very real and human, with their complex psychological states and relations. This is the direct opposite of stories that use supposedly real-life situations to paint robotic and shallow characters. No spoilers here. All I can say is that the story builds up well and the pace is excellent. The tragedies serve the plot. Good surprises here and there but no unnecessary twists. Resolutions also come in layers. The ending was impactful and satisfying, with a characteristic hint of sadness and loss typical of Eastern cultures.",1636916358,1638382449,True,20,1,0.656869232654571533,0,True,False,False

The production values and sheer amount of content for its price are honestly amazing.

Before going into detail though, there are 2 negative points that may be dealbreakers depending on the person:
[list]
[*] Always online requirement 
[*] Mediocre english translation: it starts out pretty good but gets worse after a while. Typos, grammar mistakes and all around stiffness. It is understandable, but not very fluent.
[/list]

If those things are no dealbreakers for you though, then you are in for a grand adventure. 
The story and characters are very good, the environments are breathtaking and incredibly varied, the real-time action combat is simple but fun and the amount of optional contant is staggering.
There are many sidequests, fishing, a card game, an upgradeable home base with a research and crafting system with various NPCs (and monsters) to recruit and train and a customizeable house and garden and more.

This game came out as the top candidate.

Gujian 3’s genre is called Xianxia, which, to oversimplify it, can be compared to high fantasy, featuring grandiose stories with gods interacting with mortals, fey and demon races in century old conflicts, and heroes swordfighting while defying gravity, all this infused with Chinese folklore, myth and history. 

It becomes immediately clear that this game looks amazing. The locations are spectacular, magical and have great variety. The devs weren’t shy using bright colors and grand vistas, and even locations where you only spend ten minutes are memorable. There are all kinds of environments, like quasi historical Chinese towns, ominous forests, mountain range with lava lakes, cities with otherworldly architecture and strange dreamscapes, like the one where you end up in a Chinese theater play that came to life. On most areas even just walking around is a joy. Bonus points to the devs for including a photo mode and Ansel support.

It’s hard to write about the story, mostly because I don’t want to spoil it, but also because there are a lot of things happening over the course of the game, but the basic premise goes something like this:

The game’s world is made up of two realms, the common realm, which includes heaven, the mortal world, and the underworld, and the spirit realm, where all kinds of fairy and demon races live. One of the fey clans called Shadowchasers have been guarding the passage between the two realms for generations. Their king, Xuange, received a fatal wound and feels his time in near, but it turns out he has a long lost twin brother, Beiluo, who was exiled in his childhood and grew up among the mortals. Xuange orders Beiluo to be brought to the clan’s city, to ask him to become the next king, but Beiluo is very reluctant to do so, and he would rather go back to the mortal world. The events that happen next however make it impossible to turn back, and our hero has no choice but to embark on an epic journey.

The game is deeply infused with taoist and Chinese mythology, and history, and has very deep and rich lore. I really enjoyed exploring the world, and the stories in it. I have some knowledge about these things but still had to look up a few things (like what a Trigram is), but the story can be followed without issue, and there’s an ingame encyclopedia to help navigate the names and events. The part of Chinese history that gets a bigger emphasis is the reign of the Yellow Emperor, and his era is being shown too, which I found really cool. Many fantasy worlds have histories going back thousands of years, but few have their own stone age, which Chinese history provides here, since the Yellow Emperor was a late neolithic ruler. The games depiction of (the fantasy version of) the shamanistic era of Chinese history with its architecture and costumes was a highlight for me.

The gameplay has two main parts (apart from running around), combat and dialogues. The combat is pretty straightforward, you have stamina, but it’s only used for dodging and blocking. Attacking is free, but enemies have hyperarmored attacks, which you can’t interrupt, unless you use special abilities. These abilities need energy, that you gain by landing attacks. There’s more to it, but that’s the gist of it. It works well, fun to play, and looks good. Apart from mobs there are also bossfights of course. I started the game on normal, but there were still bosses that were quite difficult, especially in the first third of the game. Don't panic if you struggle with the first boss. Some fights also have QTEs, which are an unforgivable sin, but at least there’s only a few, and they are not the instakill kind. As for the conversations, there are practically no dialogue choices, it’s just cutscenes of people talking, and there are a lot of that. Someone wrote that sometimes this game feels like watching a Xianxia series, and there’s some truth to that. It didn’t bother me though, I enjoyed it. I think every dialogue adds to the story, lore and characters.

There’s more to the gameplay though. We have sidequests, of varying quality. Some are empty fetch quests, some are just an extra cutscene, and some are longer more elaborate ones. The latter kind is hard to miss, but other than that you have to get a feel for which ones are important. The ones that point to or mention your teammates are worth checking out. There some other activities and minigames, because of course there are. There’s a card game with collectable cards, a fishing minigame, but the real deal happens when we get our … pocket dimension.

That’s where the „fun” begins. This is where you craft things (weapon, armor, customization), and research new crafting recipes. For this you need raw materials, that you can get via expeditions or farming. For farming you need seeds that you can buy, and for the expeditions you need creatures in your service. You can acquire these by defeating their leader, who then joins you. You can then send your creatures to expeditions. Okay, so now we have materials, but this is not enough, we also need artisans. They can be acquired via sidequests. They are going to do the actual crafting and researching. The latter is a minigame that you can fail btw, in which case you lose the materials you used for it, which got annoying really fast. Luckily there are guides for this. But the icing on the cake is that both your creatures and artisans get tired from working, and when they are tired you need to feed them, for which you need to make food, which is done via crafting and researching again, for which you need materials again, which you have to farm or gather again and AAAAAAAAAAAH. Am I supposed to save the world here, or manage a supernatural farmstead? ... You get used to handling the pocket dimension after a while, but I think this is a bit of a bloat here. There’s fun stuff in there but there's just too much micromanagement involved with it. Oh, btw, we also have a house with a garden in there that we can customize with stuff that we also get through crafting or expeditions...

Apart from this (potentially massive) distraction, the game is linear. There are a few occasions where you can choose your answer or action, but these don’t alter the story in a major way. The game is made up of many areas, some small, some larger, and while we eventually get the ability to fast travel between them, the only real reason to do so are side quests.

One thing I have to mention, which some people consider a big negative: the always online requirement. The game stores our saves on the server with no local copy, so you need internet to play it. I didn’t have any issues with this, but I understand if it is a problem for some. Another bug is that for many people outside China, the game defaults to Chinese language on first launch. It took me some google-fu to figure out how to change it to English. I made a quick guide for it:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2633290122
All in all, this game was an amazing experience. A huge, epic adventure, in fantastic, magical locations, with memorable friends and villains, in a world that was new to me and is underrepresented in gaming, at least outside of the Chinese language sphere. Highly recommended.

Is it an interesting story? Maybe. Translation could be better. The characters could certainly be more introspective and things could be explained better.
Does it need to have constant online connectivity? Nope, but it has it anyway.

I'll never understand the dev's weird save system that requires selecting a server. I'll never understand why if you get disconnected you'll be booted out of the game. I'll never understand why you can't even boot the game in offline mode. I'll never understand why it defaults to the Chinese Mainland server if you run it from the shortcut. All of that is bad and eventually this game is going to be unplayable so be forewarned.

Minor nitpicks of mine involve the island that you can sort of customize - Why can't I get the dorms to match the main theme? Fishing is also that terrible tapping buttons mechanic that a lot of these games use. The card game is also focused on previous game knowledge to set up some combos. It's not needed but it helps. As I said, more side quests would have been good and the game has story lines that occur in the background that the character plays no part in. As an example, there's a group of people in the first town that are looking for a criminal. You can't even talk to them or anything. Same deal with the performers. In other games the character would have been involved in their plot. It just seems like a missed opportunity. In Skyelk they're always talking like it's a MMO city - speaking of getting ores for weapons and going around the spirit world to festivals but that is just locked away from the player. It even looks like something out of an MMO. Speaking of SkyElk - I hate the design. Doors lead to walls or cliffs - no guardrails. They just placed buildings wherever.

Pros:
-Great graphic, almost like FFXV standard.
-Good combat, need block and dodge instead of just spamming button like FFXV.
-Great varieties of fun mini game (fishing, forging, building houses)
-A lot of cut scene ( By a lot I mean really a lot, sometimes was wondering whether am I playing game or watching movies ) 
-Excellent translation as there are a lot of Chinese culture involved, I am impressed with the amount of effort in this area.
-Cute mascot (Yup that fat squirrel is kinda funny)

Cons:
- [strike]UNSTABLE SERVER ! ( Required connection when you are starting game, saving, and loading new area ), this is a huge turnoff and the main reason why I can't recommend this game. Imagine you are gonna face the boss in the next area only to be kick out because UNSTABLE CONNECTION (server sided).[/strike]

(still require connection to play but seem to be stable these days)

- [strike]As of now, I don't see much different is the skill available to use, only that its much more damage, no elemental damage or resist status to be seen yet.[/strike]

-In the beginning, some the of the side quest are hard to complete, for example, searching for flower which are hiding around the town area. ( Not that important as it only provided extra money, but I just wanted to mention it out )
-You only get more weapon, potion, food when you are able to access your house, which is in the later half of the game ( Kinda late in my opinion )

Anyway for me it's the best Action RPG game with deep story, great bossfights, fun combat and stunning locations I've ever played!
Game made me more surprised than ever, expexted sort of casual hack n slash but then it really blowed my mind.
Love variety of the dream worlds and town villages. Love main characters or side activities. Even fishing was somehow interesting.
Cards minigame and little chest puzzles total cool
So many bosses to defeat
Diffrent outfits on characters <3
Exploring new locations was breathtaking experience, always something new and all the landscapes so fascinating!
I regret not making all sidequests before moving forward, thought I could do more of them after completing main story but they were missable unfortunately 

I was really sad after getting to the end, it all ended so suddenly despite 60 hours I had in this game.

Also i grabbed game on sale but it's still worth regular price
I could write endless compliments but think I already covered the most of what I remember from this brilliant title. 11/10

Now that I'm older, it's getting harder and harder to stay interested when I start a new one. That said, I actually finished this one! This game really surprised me, since I bought it on a whim when it was on sale. You can get descriptions of the game from other comments, so I won't go into detail, but the feel of the game due to the music, plot, and characters felt both real and mature. There were a number of complex themes during the game that made me appreciate the depth of the writing and world building. 

I wasn't sure what to expect for the translation quality since I've never played a game developed in China before, but the English was excellent with the occasional minor spelling error. My only complaints would be the always-online requirement (because I'm worried the servers may go down and I won't be able to play this again in the future) and that some of the mini-games were kind of annoying since sometimes they relied on traditional Chinese knowledge that I knew nothing about.

 The combat wasn't particularly deep, but I'm more interested in characters and plots anyway, so I just turned the difficulty to easy and cruised through. If you're the type of person to appreciate well-crafted combat systems where you can choose all sorts of different abilities for combos, you'll probably be a bit disappointed, since it seemed like spamming two abilities was enough to beat the game (the charging multi-hit attack and the self-heal attack, in case you wanted to know). If you can tolerate a ""Tales of"" type game with somewhat linear levels, repeated enemies, and fairly shallow combat, you'll probably be fine with this game.

There is romance in this game, but I won't spoil the details. I thought the romance was handled maturely enough that it really added to the game, rather than coming across as a sort of weird dating sim (*cough* Mass Effect).

In conclusion, I'd easily recommend this game to someone interested in Chinese culture who's more interested in plots and characters than combat. This game is also useful for teaching you about how to pronounce Chinese names correctly (sort of, they say the names so fast that it can be hard to catch). Why 'Zh' is pronounced like 'J', I'll never know.",1634965171,1634965171,True,53,3,0.820629239082336426,4,True,False,False

Positive aspects:
- Incredibly beautiful visuals.
- A story so complex and deep and emotional that will make you drop tears.
- Action exists in normal world, dream world, spirit world, and psyche world, the imagination and vision of the creators is just mind blowing.
- The game is inspired from Chinese history, legends and mythology but has an original story.
- Game contains philosophical concepts and practical ideas about a better world and better people, also moral lessons, I think game was designed to fit all ages.

What the game lacks:
- Open world, meaning you can't just go continually to all places, you need a teleport and wait for  a loading time when going from area to area, inability to swim or go and explore ant visible area, but for a game released in 2018 I think the game engine is quite ok.
- Although the game creators made it clear that are able to do almost anything, for a Chinese mythological game I would expect my character to be able to fly and jump over buildings all the time no only on certain circumstances in the game.
- Ability to continue the game after the main story quests are done. As a player after recruiting all kinds of creatures and characters to populate my personal island which has it's own life I would expect to be able to to continue to take care of my people and creatures needs and also to be able to continue the side quests after the main story line/quests are completed. 
- Sometimes fighting systems is not clear enough, when to many enemies and to many team mates is hard to understand which one did the actual fighting. 

Over all:
One of the best games I ever played, game engine it's not so complex as Skyrim (Elder scrolls 5) or Witcher 3 (Red engine) and the freedom of movement is not so complex as in Divinity (Ego Draconis), but the story, the visuals and the overall game experience is unique and beautiful, something which you will remember as a special thing in your mind and heart.

TLDR: Single player only game requires constant online connection, if internet drops, game drops.

There is a good game under here but still can't recommend it. The DRM is punishing for actual customers, meanwhile the cracked version works better with no issue. If you live anywhere with unreliable internet, this game is unplayable as it requires constant connection and the moment your connection drops, so does the game. Sometimes it's not even you, their servers have crapped out too. All this effort put into punishing actual customers when that time could of been spent on making the game much better. For example, it's inventory/menu system is terrible. You'll end up with a lot of items but with no way to organize them, it's like digging through a pile of crap every time. There are better games out there that don't punish paying customers.

Extra notes: I have way more hours then actual playing time on this. The game has a gathering mechanic where creatures you send out bring back resources after so much time. Only you have to have the game open for this to progress. So while they require an always on connection, they don't give the benefit of having these progress while you don't play.

我一直是汉语RPG的支持者，仙剑3 3外 4都是入的正。古剑也买了1和3。轩辕剑也买过好多代。
所以怎么说呢，古剑三大概是迄今为止的国产RPG巅峰吧，卖99也算是挺良心了。但是需要打磨的东西真的挺多的。

1 跳跃和空气墙。
实话说无论是物理引擎还是图像表现上或者手感上其实都不是很支持这种爬爬爬的游戏模式。
看着能站上去的地方站不上去，看着能过去的地方过不去，看着能站上去的地方会掉下去。跳跳跳的部分整体上做的毫无体验。说的难听掉，不如取消。

2 小怪类型太少了。
从序章开始打下等魔，打了一百年。boss也是刃魔，心魔来回杀，打到后面真的挺疲倦的。

3 莫名其妙地跑图设计。
很多时候莫名其妙就让跑图，如果说能触发什么剧情也就算了，很多时候真的就是为了拖延游戏时间而拖延游戏时间。最典型的就是祭坛出来以后，要先从赤水跑上去，然后一路杀怪啥下来，再上去，跑到鹿溪尽头，然后最无语的是要再一路从鹿溪尽头一路跑到赤水入口。。。为什么这段不允许直接传送啊？或者，更根本的，为啥非要做个鹿溪地图啊。简直无语。

4剧情
实话说，剧情稀烂。
从开头猜到结尾，完全没啥悬念。感情的表现也挺一般的。整体来说挺无聊。

Combat is fluid, but is held back with its design that seems to be meant for controllers. You can only assign 4 skills at once.

Also, maybe you could try adjusting some game graphic to mid or high instead of full HD all the way. I've seen comments about game crashing alot. I always do that to my games for smoother gameplay. Just adjust a couple of them and it's all good.

It's definitely not a bad game although it's not a perfect game either. I bought it during sales and it's worth it. If you're interested but is hesitating, just wait till sales :)",1627898102,1627898102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am one of, possibly the only person on earth that has got to experience this game in true fluid butterlike 60fps. And it completely transforms the experience. You absolutely need to use SpecialK tool which fixes the framepacing and forces the game to run in exclusive fullscreen mode. Then it immediately becomes a silky butter smooth effortless 60fps like youve never experienced before. Seriously its smooth. Like flawlessly smooth.

The games got content too. Like lv 50 type stuff. Im only lv like 10 i think. Theres so many different skill paths to branch out and try, And you can refund skillpoints as much as you like without penalty. Some buffs have passive effects like item droprate boost and i really like that.

This game has like legitimate items and weapons and content. Im impressed. This is an awesome game. I absolutely love this game. I bought the other two games for 2 bucks + 1 buck as well so i will try those later

This is a massive disappointment and a waste of time. From the trailers and screenshots this might seem like a triple A game but the overall experience leaves too much to be desired. The animation and even the engine overall are awkward. Story progression is slow AF, they don't even tell you wtf this thing's about in the trailer and descriptions, don't you find that weird? Not only do they not know how to tell a story, they also don't know how to design a game. Character movements are awkward, map designs are bad, combat is insanely boring, there's no counter play.

Not so much in alternative endings save for a couple of optional boss fights. If you have played CRPGs before and have been exposed to Chinese mythology then this game will feel familiar but with some twists. Easily one of the more epic stories in the CRPG xianxia genre. cut-scenes can be quite overwhelming.

Gameplay: Combat quite fluid, souls like, not much to complain. However I mainly played the game for the story and did not delve into the mechanics too much. There are quite a number of bosses with varying mechanics and some are quite memorable. There is a fair bit of skill customisation. No real weapon choice save for socketing modifiers. Armors can be upgraded as you level but no real choice either. Game is not open world with each region having is own map. There is a bit of variety in environments. Fast travel exists between each region but personally feel the number of fast travel points can be increased as there are few instances where you have to spend a bit of time going back and forth. Lotuscape (base building) was a fun distraction.

Graphics: Definitely one of the more visually impressive CRPGs played to date. some of the environments are quite breathtaking. However that level of polish is not consistent, with some assets that looks quite outdated and bland.

If you like story related open world games like gothic or witcher and are even a litte bit interessted in chinese mythology, just buy it!
The most problamatic point for this game in my opinion are the chinese standard setting. Because of that 2 hints in advance:
1) look up bevorhand how to change the language to english
2) each time when you start the game, it will always asks something in chinese. Thats the server you want to play and save your game. If you are not in China, always choose the second option, which is a server in US with a much better performance.

Now a bit more in detail:
This game is a great mix of travelling in a beautiful world, interessting storytelling, challenging fights, as well as an engaging housing system including farming, craftig and managing workers.

The environment looks really great with a lot of details in a chinese and mystical setting. There are never really long distances you have to travel in the mainstory without interessting encounters like enemies, conversations or additional lore. But if you progress, you can go back to the most locations to walk around and do some additional stuff, or just watching the scenerie.

The story itself is mostly linear with only a few decisions and is told via a lot of small cinematic trailers in chinese voicing and english subtitles. One problem can be, to remember the chinese names. An other problem can be the text speed if your english isn't good enough, because you can't pause the cutscenes.
For the names there is a lore section which keeps trak of all the important information and you don't need to worry about the correct voicing if your not familiar with chinese. Just make you own voicing of the name which will help a lot.
For the cutscences ... you can load each storypoint of your savefile via the mainscreen of the game and redo each part, or you try to find english letsplays to read it.
This loading system is also great if you want to do achievements, because one savefile is enough to redo each step where you missed one.

The combatsystem is based on combos of light and heavy attacks als well as active skills which feel smoth and natural. You mostly fight together with NPC's which are really a help and you get something like a pet system to also summon them for short attacks.
The fighting itself is fastpaced whereever you need to avoid or block enemy attacks and can't just rush in. Even the adds during the story can be a problem if you are lazy, but getting much easier when you outleveled them. The bosses instead are always challanging and on higher difficulties you may even need a while to figure out how to beat them. 

Between the Storypoints you can and should use your freetime to explore the wold you can travel to to find side storys, additional quest, collect materials and find new pakt creatures. Thats important because progress in mainstory also means passing time in gameworld which results in disapearing quests, lore, skins, conversations, if you didn't find or finished them.
it can be worth to look up some information about easyly missable things, even if there are just a few english guides.

When you unlocked your housing and pet system, its also worth to research and craft new weapon skins, better armor, additional accesoires, crystals, food and medicine, train your pets and workers, or just build up and decorate your house.",1627204346,1627204346,True,125,0,0.902775287628173828,1,True,False,False

Also, since I was reading through reviews trying to get the DL on this point: this game is in Chinese with English subs. If that's not an inherent problem for you, the subs are quite good- few conjugations here and there but it's solid. 

It has a good story- I don't like heavy handed story telling, but this has actually been quite engaging. I've liked the characters, and they don't go on for minutes longer than they have to, trying to set the stage with every last detail of history and character all at once. I'm liking it, where in games like this (Eastern) the story telling puts me off more often than not. Heavy anime story vibes aren't for me- while the character design is certainly like that, the story is not.

Speaking of which, the graphics, and particularly the art design, are very strong. The cities and landscapes have great character to them and a nice feel for an epic RPG tale. It ain't RTX 2021 stuff, but it looks really good.

The gameplay is very smooth and strong, with impactful strikes and some interesting (though hardly ground-breaking) early mechanical systems. I expect that it gets much more involved based on the inventory and keybinding indications. I've seen a review or two saying that it gets repetitive, and that may be true 50 hrs in, but it's not because all you do is light-light-heavy- dodge. It's not GoW or Bayonetta, but it's very, very robust.

I've fought two bosses so far, and both were quite good. The second was very hard (I'm playing on Hard- there are easier settings) and I thought it was just perfect as far as difficulty. Had to replay 6-8 times to get it down (a good player would've finished much sooner), but it was very satisfying to manage my defense correctly and finally get it right. It had that feeling of 'absolutely doable, but you can't just wing it.'

I'm really looking forward to getting further into this. I'm excited and wanted to give the thumbs up to anyone else who might get this in their queue and hope against hope that it's something cool that they hadn't seen yet- it's great!

I cannot believe I missed this game all these years.

NOTE: FEEDBACK CONTAINS SPOILERS 

Keeping that aside, summarizing my points on the game:

Story:
1) In my eyes seems to be the best I have ever played.
2) The dialogues are not trash at all and one can even learn a few life lessons from them.
3) The lore section in the settings is really well organized and presented. 

Gameplay:
1) Smooth, crisp. In places that I would usually expect buggy behavior does not seem to be the case. I commend the developers greatly for managing to achieve this.
2) Combat is amazing with a ton of different combinations of skills to adopt and try out. 
3) Teammates (npc) are surprisingly useful in combat. Sometimes on low health I would just bob n weave till my team finishes the enemies off. 
4) Teammate skills and main character skills synergize amazingly well. 

Music:
1) Loved it. I would say its the music that made me play some parts of the game more than the hours I wanted to. 
2) Favorite music region: Demonbones.

A few minor concerns:
1) The help section can be better detailed about how to play some minor games (card game for instance) and workshop tutorials should be made available in the help section.
2) Description of items and their use  while crafting them in workshop can be more detailed (eg: I was not aware that the swords we craft in workshops are just skins for your primary weapon)
3) Description of spirit stones and where we can find them must be available. I was not aware until endgame that we can mainly get them by crafting in our workshop and certain rare chests (puzzle ones).
4) The game ended with quite a few questions open. For instance, were the trigrams of Skyelk fixed or no? Wasn't that the primary reason to go to the mortal world? And what about Beiluo and the Eclipser after endgame? Nothing was said about them... It's kinda annoying a bit that the protagonist of the game does not appear in the final cutscene. 

Final verdict:
Game is near flawless. 
Certain endgame story can be hinted towards another sequel rather than leaving it unanswered. 
Most certainly would recommend playing this. Had a lot of fun.",1626346788,1626346788,True,61,8,0.721968531608581543,2,True,False,False

—— After the main game line ends, Ji Xuanyuan said before leaving.
I rushed to write a review after I cleared the level in a week.
The plot of the game is really great. Although there is room for improvement in many aspects, Gujian3 will always be the bright moonlight in my heart! Beiluo is cool, Xiaoyingzi is lively and simple, Yun Wuyue seems indifferent but warm. Throughout the week, I feel that I not only have a good gaming experience, but also made some good friends!
The game not only has a good plot and a high level of gameplay (Qianqiu card), and there is a very thought-provoking theme. Whether it is a human race, a monster race or a demon race, even if it is as powerful as Pixie , it will also encounter the crisis of overthrowing the tribe at every turn, all are struggling to survive between heaven and earth. Don't envy the innate strength of others, what will the world look like three thousand years later?. The theme of this work is handed down. I think that people really need some lofty ideals to pursue, just like Xiaoyingzi and Mr. Ge, they don't ask for much success from themselves, but seek to learn everything to benefit future generations. Maybe we will do the same.

This is an incredibly beautiful game and from the little I played, the combat mechanics seem fun.

What I don't like:
1. This doesn't make me feel like I'm playing a Wuxia game with ancient China background. The aesthetics are way too heavily influenced by western games. After entering the first city, I feel like I entered Rivendell with Elven structures and people wearing Elven styled armors.
2. Character outfit designs breaking immersion. In store page, 3rd screenshot. Girl wearing short skirt looks way too modern and out of place with the setting.
3. The character animation when you stop running. I have a genuine hatred for games that decide it's ""realistic"" or a good idea to have characters slightly bend the knee in a mini crouch after they stop running. The biggest issue is because the camera dips along with it. There's a minor motion sickness issue here.

I'm still giving this game a thumbs up because I know I am probably biased, but I stopped playing because I was expecting ancient China. I might revisit this game again in the future, but for now I'll wait for Fate Seeker 2.",1624607578,1624607578,True,4,0,0.517595171928405762,0,True,False,False

[list]

[*][b]Very scenic[/b] when exploring
[*][b]Fluid controller support[/b] and the button mapping makes sense.
[*][b]Music does not pause in loading screens[/b], flows between scenes real nice.

[*][b]Diverse Mini-game[/b] substitutes out of combat loop
[*][b]Nice story cutscene placements[/b] between missions
[*][b]Comparatively makes more sense with little context[/b] as compared to (Sword of Legend Online), I didn't play Gujian 1 or 2 to be able to understand this game.

[h2]Cons[/h2]
[list]
[*][b]1080p Cutscenes[/b] can be uglier than in game renders at times
[*][b]English subtitles are confusing[/b] and makes little sense in conventional conversations due to blundering of poetic and philosophical sentences into casual but not accurate common english phrasings.
[*][b]Terrible repeating soundbites[/b], 2 second loop maximum for walking on hard marble and water noises is a 1 second loop. Combat is okay with sound.
[*][b]No subtitles in loading screen[/b] when loading, while playing dialogue, it does not show subtitles. (rarely happens)
[*][b]Invisible walls and no double jump[/b], it circumcised its own vertical exploration by giving you a big open land but invisible walls.
[*][b]The skyhaven city is big and empty.[/b] It's the big city you're suppose to be impressed by, vast and empty, depopulated but stretched big.
[*][b]Linear-open, instead of sandbox-open[/b], feels like I'm playing a PS2 game
[*][b]Almost no facial animation[/b], seriously sometimes I don't even think the lips are moving.
[*][b]Always-Online DRM[/b] the game is saved in the cloud. Impossible to play if your internet is lacking. This is a single player game.
[*][b]6 hours later, I noticed I saved into launch option 1[China][/b] vs launch option 2[North America]. Due to their funny funny DRM, this was written all in chinese so yeah... that's why loading takes so long.
[/list]

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
This is the highest rank in the [b]B-tier[/b] games I can think of, if comparing to the Witcher 3 (imo A++), I think Gujian 3 would be every aspect an step down into B++, as the witcher 3 has a familiar gameplay loop, bigger budget, prettier game, better sound etc. And this game is just one step down from lacking that perfection and polish, but has the freedom to be more creative in narrative story telling.

The only thing this game S-ranks in, is the cutscene story and gameplay loops. There is absolutely crazy shit happening after a nice calm period, and the game likes to throw you off with its mini games that isn't just standardised third person action combat.

[h2]Comparing to Sword of Legend Online[/h2]
[h3]Ironically if this game became out as a full MMORPG with its current features, pros and cons, it would be far worse than SOLO right now.

I would have very much recommended this epic piece of art, it was very enjoyable, if not for the ****************************************** servers! The art, music, environment, story, (and to some degree the silly minigames) are very much enjoyable. What a journey, the feels! If only the characters had facial expression!

Long version: bad servers and interesting gameplay-

The Bad Servers
The game requires perpetual server connection in some foolish attempt to crackdown on illegal pirated games. In doing so they have done more harm to honest players who just want to enjoy the game in peace.
The servers are quite constantly unconnectable, the only times I can finally have some peace is past midnight like 1 in the morning. So the only way I can play the game is to mess up my real life? Ridiculous!. Also some areas of the game keep causing crashes, such as the lotus seed world, whenever i look at the general direction of the fishing net, whoops.
-
The Game itself
However in terms of the game experience, it is rather pleasant. It's got all the modern Chinese Xianxia (mythical martial heros) tropes of the genre, it's got smooth and cool combat, fantastic maps and environment and music, pleasant lore and (cliche) story telling, interesting creatures, home building and crafting system, good exploration vibes, (and along with the stereotypical characters with beautiful plastic surgery emotionless faces... if you're into that sort of thing).
-
So if you wish to fulfil your fantasies to slay demons with flashy kungfu swordplay, with your dreamy waifu followers, have a huge rodent pet sidekick, explore fantastical land of China and the spirit realm, while eating a bunch of delicious chinese food you crafted in your meticulously designed home inside a lotus seed, while forcing slave labour on native spirits and fey whom you have brutally massacred and forced into servitude....

My only complaints are that it is hard to find rough wood to craft with even when you know all the spawning locations because it won't spawn everytime you go, so I never got past building a fishing net for sidequest crafting. Fortunately I didn't to craft much after it. My other complaint is that combat can feel a bit shallow and repetitive. There is feeling of lack of weight to your attacks that becomes more apparent as the game progresses because enemies become immune to your stun and knockdown attacks.

There were quite a few titles that were truly impressive, but I still was not moved enough till I played this game by a chance recommendation through the Steam store. After 100 hours and 2 concurrent playthroughs (one in English and one in Mandarin), I have a great appreciation for the studio and the creators of the game who brought this to life - enough to acknowledge them for their amazing hidden jewel.

The last full Chinese/Mandarin production game I played was in the early 1990s on my 486 PC, it was a 2D scrolling game. Even after so many years, I cannot remember its name but I will never forget that game because of one thing - storytelling.

I'll caveat my review a bit, you need to have some appreciation for Chinese culture to get the best experience - specifically in the areas of Buddhism, spiritual cultivation philosophy, ancient Chinese dynasty life, Chinese language and its nuanced structure (granted the translations were decent with rare typos). If you can do all of this - Gujian 3 is a dizzying journey that brings you through an unexpected plot, rich with stories and beautiful graphics, a forest of perennial wisdom that is easily missed unless you look close enough. 

Other things I liked (very minor spoilers below);
- The characters have well developed backgrounds (some may think the two voice acting leads Beiluo and Yunwuyue are a bit deadpan, but I see them as mostly quite fitting to their nature). 
- Combat is decent with minor frustration with hitboxes, although I never fully explored all skills as I only used a few skills that I got lazy and used to (even on expert mode)
- The inventory/menu screen takes some getting used to, but after a few hours you get the hang of it - maybe not fully though (I certainly haven't 100% yet)
- Lotus-scape management can be a bit tedious, especially with the harvesting parts.

As a small gesture of my support, I also bought the soundtrack of which many pieces I enjoy very much. I look forward to Gujian 4 if it ever arrives, I'll be one of your early fans to sign up.",1621625613,1621625613,True,26,1,0.705549955368041992,1,True,False,False

The [b]environments are gorgeous[/b], and I took a lot of screenshots. Mountains, desert, valleys, caves, lush greens... and seasons too. The music was quite beautiful too, in a sombre way, and I thought it went well with the atmosphere of each environment.  This was my favorite part and I spent a lot of time exploring, and this is reflected in my hours played. 

The [b]characters feel very mature[/b], and I found this very refreshing. There are long dialogues and conversations where they explore various aspects of the in-game world, history, and also aspects of humanity like culture and learning.  However it's somewhat contrasted by everyone's flawless boyband/girlband appearances, I assume this is done to appeal to general audiences tastes. 

There's a [b]lot of story in this game[/b], a lot.  And while I enjoyed that too, I felt the game could have done with a bit of 'editing' in terms of story [i]telling[/i].  What I mean is - there's a lot of stuff going on and I was able to follow it at a high level, however the dialogues and actions to support the story would sometimes go into too much detail, or would suddenly and abruptly change to different directions, to be revisited later.  However I did my best to keep my attention focused and the payoff was worth it, I think overall the story was cohesive enough for me to follow and understand the interlinks.  But I just know that I've missed appreciating the finer points.  

Despite my positive feelings for the game, I'm not a fan of the main character, who felt like a [b]Generic Wuxia Protagonist™[/b] - if you've read light novels, you'll know what I mean: all powerful, knows everything, zero emotions, always has a hidden spell handy.  I felt this was worth mentioning as it drives a lot of design decisions in the game.  The main one I noticed was the party system - you don't really get to experience the party as GWP is constantly sending people away or dismissing them.  You can't switch to other characters during the combat.  Many important fights occur without your party.  It affects the combat system too which isn't very deep or rewarding, it's just a thing you do.  

That said, all the other characters (the supporting cast) are quite interesting.  Each one has a backstory and their own motivation and conviction for doing things. This lends to the humbleness and maturity I mentioned earlier. 

And a small thing that sometimes spoiled the fun - the game requires a [b]constant server connection[/b].  There are no local or cloud saves, it's all on their own servers.  Sometimes the game will freeze if the connection to their server is unstable.  When you first launch the game, there is a dialog that gives you a choice of 1 (Chinese servers) and 2 (North American servers).  And the wrong choice here will contribute to a bad connection, however, most people won't know what's going on, as the dialog is in Chinese.  Of course I found out what it was about later - which is the wrong way of going about UI. 

Overall - definitely recommended, make sure you're fine with lots of dialogue.  From start to finish it's basically a narrative.  Don't go in expecting a fast pace and handholding.   None of the negative parts I've mentioned are really that bad at all, the game has a lot more positives to it that makes it worth experiencing.

The good:
- The art style is beautiful
- It has a rich story and lore
- The graphics is good
- The game has tons of content
- The game has a good price, offering good value for money
- Great soundtracks
- Excellent use of Chinese mythology in the storytelling. 

The average:
- The combat is ok but not great. It lacks depths like the combat system in Final Fantasy 15. It is hard to tell what's going on when you are fighting multiple enemies; it is simply, chaotic.
- The story's pace is odd. The last 20% of the game is anti climatic
- Some mini games, like the card game, are good. But some mini games, such as fishing, is boring.
- The character models look good, but their faces aren't memorable and while their faces are beautiful but they feel artificial; every character look like a teenage super star from boy and girl bands.
- The cut scenes are nice but there are too many of them.

The bad:
- The characters don't have facial expressions. In fact, their mouths don't even open when they speak. 
- The levels are poorly designed. This is an RPG, but the levels feel too long and intentionally bloated with traps. 
- Some of the side missions are fetch quests with no story, and they are boring.
- The ""home"" system is overly complex


The positives of Gujian 3 outweighs the negatives. For some reason, this game reminds me of Final Fantasy 15. It is good but not great. However it is nice to see a game that is set in ancient China.

On expert difficulty it has some of the best combat in any game I've played for a while.  Every enemy - especially early on with limited health restoration items - is a threat and can kill you in a few hits.  The bosses I found to particularly enjoyable (and frustrating at times in a good way) to fight.  Although difficult, they never felt unfair and you always knew it was your fault when you died in a fight.  Boss fights were never overly long as they aren't very tanky, the difficulty comes from the damage they do (with many being able to 1 or 2 shot the player on expert difficulty) and learning their move set. 

Outside of combat, there are other mini games to play and things to craft.  I didn't do too much crafting outside of cosmetic items for characters but it is there.  There is a housing system where you can farm, fish, and build among other things.  But honestly, I didn't explore these features much either as I was mostly interested in combat, and they felt more like a hassle than in other games with similar features. 

When it comes to story it is perfectly serviceable, not amazing by any means but it was more than enough to keep me interested.  It suffers at times from telling instead of showing, with characters over explaining some things that I feel could have been better showed.  Also the English translation isn't very good.  It relays what is happening fine, but it seems to be worded very literally which makes it hard to understand at times.

That being said however, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and wouldn't have spent nearly 100 hrs playing it if I didn't.  The environments are gorgeous, and I love the atmosphere and gameplay.  Definitely my favorite game that I played throughout 2020-21, and I hope to see more single player content like this from the developer.",1619767696,1619767878,True,26,0,0.728119790554046631,0,True,False,False

The combat is fluid and the variety of different attacks/buffs allow you to (to a certain extent) customise your combat style. The story is pretty engaging and it encourages you to explore and get the sidequests. The cutscenes are a welcome change of pace, though i have to admit there's a lot of them in certain portions of the game making it a little overbearing from time to time. Weapon skins look amazing though ! 

There were however some aspects that i did not like. The research system is fun and intuitive, but very punishing if you even get 1 thing wrong (even at high skill levels) which makes little sense. Some boss fights are super easy (and boring) whilst others are superhard. This unequal distribution of boss difficulty makes the pacing of the game annoying at time. Lastly, the customisation options are rather limited which is ok if it's not your thing, but somewhat dissapointing if you want to deck out Beiluo somewhat :)",1619555288,1619555288,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If people are fans of those Netflix Chinese supernatural martial arts dramas this will seem very familiar, you'll find a lot of tropes you'll be familiar with and love as you embark on a larger than life story. Along with that note, I watch those types of Chinese shows (as well as Korean shows and anime) so I'm quite familiar with the storytelling, pacing, and most importantly - subtitles. For people not accustomed to these things, this might be difficult to keep up with. But those that are familiar with find it really easy to fall in love with this world. I haven't gotten too far in at the time of the review but I've fought monsters and gods already. And speaking of fighting, the action captures that supernatural martial arts feel beautiful. 

I don't know what Gujian 1 and 2 are, this is my first experience with the Gujian world but the story is easy to get into and I don't feel lost despite not having played G1 and G2.

即时战斗看似比回合制先进了，但其实做得并不好玩。以往RPG的好玩之处除了故事以外，还有与之环环相扣的多名角色成长，让人有想肝的动力。但做成即时战斗以后，实际上只能操作一名角色，角色技能成长也影响不大，到头来也是无脑砍。

迷宫又臭又长，小怪皮硬血厚，怪多起来根本躲不了攻击。游戏前期药物还十分有限，迷宫途中没有补给，这样的安排非常有问题。动不动就画个圈让你在圈里找线索，然后自己手动扫描每一寸土地。

每次触发剧情都是突然黑屏，好歹弄成渐变黑会顺滑很多，没那么突兀，这样的小细节不难做啊。再来就是经常一段剧情播完后让我操作角色，没走几步又黑屏来另一段剧情。就不能一次性播放整段吗？让我操作就为了走几步路有意义吗？

于是我想，以上都不介意，纯看剧情好了吧？但是剧情节奏太慢，人物对白太装逼，总是喜欢弄的高深莫测，让人代入不了。前期天鹿城一段很紧凑，但是到了第二个城后就突然慢了下来，剧情变得非常散，没有重点。

That is actually super rare in AAA games to take the time for idle matters like these.

However the execution is not perfect. 
I will just start listing some random thoughts occuring in my mind:
- An example would be how the dream hunt lady (forgot the name) tells beiduo how she was imprisoned for years and trained herself to become so strong she could singlehandedly destroy a whole kingdom. Thats nice and all but there is literally no weight to this cutscene that could have been super cool - like at least show some little cutscenes while she talks or at least change the music to something that gets your heart going.. but nope it is literally just her mouth that moves for like 2-3 minutes until she has told the whole story... and that's it.. no further questions asked and that stuff is never brought up again. That was just one example, many cutscenes are unfortunately wasted like this. Also I cannot judge the voice acting since I don't understand chinese but it also sounds very monotonous all the time so it doesn't help when characters only talk several minutes without any nice pictures or 'cutscenes'.

- The gameplay and cutscenes seem to be disjointed as well - like the one team didn't know what the other team is doing. Example: You run into a big empty field and suddenly a cutscene gets triggered that shows that in the middle of that ""empty"" field there is actually a huge monster.. but the gameplay didn't show it. Or at other times a cutscene end in front of some place (with the sword of the character drawn) and the gameplay immediately starts somewhere else without a drawn sword.. this and the lack of a slow fade into black before the gameplay continues are kind of disrupting the immersion which is a no go for an RPG.

- Treasures are so unbelievably rare and you need to solve some riddle I never understood. Also you need some rare items to open the chests. So I never really bothered - it is too much of an hassle..

- There seems to be quite a lack of customization. I only bought 2 armors for the main characters. That's it. You keep pretty much the same weapon from start to finish. Not very RPG-esque.

- The pacing is sometimes hell and you don't know why you do stuff. The translations also don't help.

- The story is being told backwards. At the beginning you are like ""why should I care about some old farts and clans from several thousand years ago??!"" but over the course of 20-30 hours you will see why. The story is driven on these ""a-haa so that's what/who they were talking about"" and yeah.. At least for me, I actually still don't know what the story is ACTUALLY about or why I had to do all the things

- The middle section gets quite interesting with ""world travel"". Not only the worlds are super beautiful and atmospheric but the gameplay can change with them as well. Very nice concept! Feelt a little bit like Kingdom Hearts.

- The UI is TERRIBLE. It took me more than I'm willing to admit to find out how to navigate the map... (you will need to do it.. A LOT in order to continue with the story - really weird design)

- Battle system is quite allright. Not much different then the witcher 3 to be honest. Witcher 3 battles were not that great so it is quite the same here. But it is still kind of fun. You need to master blocking at the right time instead of dodging or else it won't feel good

- I did not understand the card mini game. Really weird.. Never touched it again after 2-3 games. The fact nothing is translated on these cards also does not help

- THE LANDSCAPES ARE BEAUTIFUL. THE GRAPHICS ARE UNREAL.THE NPC'S ARE BEAUTIFUL!! Some NPC's could seriously be considered protagonist material in other games - every single NPC received so much love in modeling phase it is unreal

- The game is not shy to show some LOVE. This is such nostalgia back to when final fantasy was still about romance and stuff. Somehow big budget games have thrown out the theme of love because they are afraid it does not attract enough people? Anyway, was beautiful to see a bit of it and helped making the characters more ""real"". (The romance part still is subtle tho it won't get pushed down your throat)

- The soundtrack is beautiful and very relaxing but I think it lacks variation. You pretty much hear the same 3-4 tracks over and over again. Or maybe there are more but overall they all sound very much alike. More action/mystery/horror orientied soundtracks would be nice to fit some moods better.

- The world building is unbelievably good. Witcher niveau, even more! I guess it is because it seems to be based on real chinese mythology - so the authors have plenty of stuff to tell.

TLDR:
Even though I listed mainly bad points I still liked this game because I WISH that more triple AAA games take their times to explore characters and worlds and to just throw players in a well crafted world. I don't care if sometimes no action is going on - just let me love the characters by making them real.
And this game does not tell a story in the 0815 fashion - it is way different then how all other games usually tell their stories. I still give it a thumps up because if the developers change their way for the next big title it could actually become a sale records breaking masterpiece.

Last but not least, even though the game received a lot of love it still requires A LOT OF PATIENCE. If you are not that guy then this game is not for you.",1615743945,1615743945,True,13,0,0.638237237930297852,0,True,False,False

To play it's a tedious slog with an aimless, meandering story, and an emphasis on absurdly overcomplicated crafting.

Gameplay makes a good first impression with its stylish presentation, but it gradually reveals how shallow it is and how little it evolves over time. You have heavy and light attacks, but no unique combos of any kind. The only different between the two attack types is merely a minor trade-off between damage and attack speed. Special skills take a very long time to recharge, and don't flow well with the normal abilities. Some of them also require certain members to be in your party, who arbitrarily leave for long periods of the story. Enemy design is pretty poor, with many of them having insufficient attack telegraphing, and many of the bosses require you to wait around for long periods of time for them to become vulnerable at all.

The story is very dull and is structured extremely badly. It has hardly any through-line to it, and has constant and severe pacing issues. Every story beat feels like a needless digression that you're only doing because some random event popped up and you're forced to deal with it before continuing on to more important matters. Except the more important things never happen. There are a few interesting concepts that do get brought up at some points in the story, but they never really get explored in any meaningful way. Instead it just feels like distraction after distraction that never ends, until it does. There is also a point around 80% of the way through the game that feels like it should be the big finale climax, but it ends up being yet another meaningless diversion that goes nowhere, making the remaining parts of the story feel even more like a drag. The characters themselves are also pretty dull and have little to no personality to them. Cutscenes are very stiff and sloppily presented, but that I can give a bit of slack to given how the cadence of the original Chinese dialogue may not necessarily be easy to translate over to what feels natural to a western observer.

Crafting is a huge pain as well, and makes up much more of the experience than feels necessary. It becomes an essential part of keeping stocked up on consumables as the game goes on, but it's a very convoluted and time consuming process that assumes knowledge that I think is unreasonable for any player, no matter where they're from. To craft objects you must first research how to make them in the first place, which involves a management minigame that includes quizzes on traditional Chinese cooking, tailoring, and smithing techniques. If you don't get every answer correct, you fail, and also lose all the resources needed to attempt the research. Both these research phases and the simple crafting done afterwards require NPCs to actually perform the task for you. These NPCs also have their own energy metre which requires food to keep stocked up, demanding yet more crafting. Certain crafting materials are also extremely hard to come by, with the game giving little to no clue where to find a lot of them. Thankfully there are some guides out there telling you where to get said materials, and the answers to the research quizzes, but they are not comprehensive at time of writing. Even with all that information, the process is far too convoluted and takes up far too much time.

So this may be a beautiful looking game that makes a good first impression, but before long it shows itself to be a boring drag that is mediocre to play at best. It's is all filler and no killer, that constantly feels like it's spinning its wheels going nowhere. I don't think I've seen a more poorly constructed story in a game, and I only finished it because I spent so long thinking that it couldn't be much longer until the end for far too long.",1615549016,1615549016,False,25,0,0.662773191928863525,0,True,False,False

The game has a beautiful story, but is held back by shoddy translation, clunky controls, and a lack of English guides. I did one playthrough in Chinese, and after starting NG+ in English I notice some glaring problems. The tooltips have many typos, and the card minigame does not translate fully. If you are willing to brave the language problem, and are willing to live with clunky controls, then the game is actually quite fun. 

The main story is linear, but you can literally spend hours on your personal farm from Act 2 onward. The crafting system is interesting, but there is a lack of guide on where to collect different components. Just beware of crafting food, as it will make you very hungry in real life.

There are three major gameplay differences from traditional RPGs. First, you cannot control who to put in your party, because it is completely scripted by the storyline. Just about every important boss fight will require you to solo it with the main protagonist. Second, your longer, cooldown skills are not learned from the skill tree, but from defeating alpha creatures and learning their signature moves. Third, there are these ""flashback"" encounters where you cannot even customize the hero you control, and these are the bottleneck encounters that folks will get stuck on.

Overall, I'm recommending it for the storyline and the crafting/farming experience, and not much else.",1614845868,1614845868,True,4,1,0.532374083995819092,0,True,False,False

If you're a fan of the games mentioned, or interested in the Chinese culture - definitely give this one a try. 

Pros: 
1) A lot of story, really exciting character arcs, interesting and well-fleshed out main characters.
2) One of the most beautiful examples of environment art I have ever seen in video games. The game world is amazing. 
3) Lovely farm/crafting side-mechanics 
4) Great soundtrack 
5) The combat system, the movement and controls have a nice feel. 

Cons:
1) There are some pacing issues, in my opinion. For example, sometimes you expect a really short introductory quest, and then you end up in a large flashback sequence.
2) The side missions are not that good at all, most of them are fetch quests, and only some of them have an actual story-line, aside from some tiny narrative text bits.
3) There are some abrupt difficulty spikes when it comes to the bosses. Some of them are way too easy/too hard, and the difficulty curve in terms of that is all over the place, I think. 
4) This is more of an action [i] than [/i] rpg type of an action-rpg game, if you know what I mean.
5) [spoiler] The ending sequence was a letdown in some ways, meaning, it was too damn short. It felt rushed, honestly. [/spoiler]

Beautiful visuals, soulful music, and a touching story full of meaningful wisdom. I owe a celebratory hug to each member of the development team that brought us Gujian 3.

So what's all that gushing translate to in gamer terms? Check it:
Mass Effect exploration scope
Black Desert Online (PC) visuals
Stardew Valley home-making elements
Catch-em all Pokeman mechanics
Neir: Automata gamepad controls
Combo based combat that allows you to show off your skills

Aurogon (developer name, I think) took all this and more and blended in a cultural experience that could only come from the side of the world opposite everything I know. I'm going to gush just one more time about the wisdom of the mentor characters in this story. Principally stoic, yet kind and patient. We need more of these sorts of stories in our lives.

Now, to feedback. Two things barred me from achieving full immersion, both were only minor. 

Firstly, it's in Chinese. Hold your stones... Thing is, I think I'm an auditory learner, reading subtitles was agony through this game, even where (most of the time) I could pause to make up for my slow reading/processing. I know in my gut this story has so much more going for it than I can give  credit here simply because I don't know the language. Food for thought for the devs, not a ding.

Second item took a long time to put into words, but it sums up to flat sound design overall. Not talking music here, that was wonderful. It's like there wasn't any/much bass in the sound effects. Richer sound would have made combat and cutscenes far more visceral and engaging. From the handful of Chinese movies I've enjoyed, I realize there's a preference for action to present more flowing with great finesse. I'm not expecting Micheal Bay WHAS everywhere. But I hope the devs are super successful selling this game so they can set aside extra budget to make Gujian 4's sound experience really hit in combat and cutscenes.

The developers must have worked very hard on this game and I really wish more people would play this game and support the developer.

So if you are the kind of person that loves story driven RPG - definitely give it a try, chances are you will absolutely enjoy it.
PROS:
1. Beautiful artwork/graphics. It was very nice to play through such a nicely designed environment. 
2. Character design and chemistry. I absolutely loved the main characters. Some side characters were very likable too!
3. Loads of crafting and things to do if you want to.
4. All bosses were uniquely designed.
5. Such a long and interesting story!!!
6. Mini card game inside!!
CONS:
1. English translations are really poor. There were times when I barely understood what was going on due to how poorly translated the subtitles were.
2. There are minor bugs. I was stuck at a part where I had to play from a previous checkpoint to be able to get past.
3. Bosses are too strong at times and their weaknesses are not obvious. I played in easiest mode and I struggled with a few bosses.
4. There are just wayyy too much crafting, mining, cooking and other side things to do! And most of them are not very obvious. If you use your minions - they lose HP and as such you have to feed them in order to be able to use them further. Each type of minion has unique food they prefer, so cooking those or finding those were pain on their own.

- biggest problem is that requires an internet connection at ALL TIMES (due to an mandatory auto-save feature that you cannot disable) which i feel is totally unnecessary, and sometimes connection to the game server is wonky and locks the game or worse, kicks you out of the game losing game progress
- learning curve is VERY steep at the beginning of the game, very difficult to get used to the game system, but once you get used to the system it's smooth sailing
- story buildup is good but gets unnecessarily over-complicated and characters lack development.  also, the ending is too anti-climatic; i didn't even know or feel that the game/story is finished until i see the credits all of a sudden
- the home/garden system is good, but turnaround time is not well-balanced; you need to jump into the home/garden system to check on crops/progress literally every 5 minutes which is a total distraction while trying to play through the main storyline. checking every 15-20 minutes would have been better in my opinion so it doesn't detract you from the main gameplay momentum

So I've bought Gujian3 and... put it aside after the first mission considering it to be some mediocre slasher. Last year I gave a go to another Chinese RPG - Xuan-Yuan Sword VII and was relatively satisfied by its story ang gameplay. After that I checked my Steam library and found long-forgotten Gujian3. Struggling to drop it during the first mission I've reached Skyelk and finally found what I seek in games - a decent RPG with involving story and interesting characters. And it appeared to be so involving that became my ""second reality"" for two weeks. Thorough gameplay took 100+ hours and almost none was boring.

First of all the game's positive sides are setting, story, characters, dialogues and game design. Throughout Beiluo's heroes' journey - from an irresponsible and immature young man running away from himself, neglecting his talents and his heredity to a mature and responsible leader of his people and his future wife - we explore Chinese mythology and legends, mysterious first cities and tribes, meet Yellow Emperor, demons and supernatural beings. The world is really beautiful here, with decent graphics and aesthetical appeal, nature and cities alike, while carefully balanced with dark, disturbing places and situations. Some dialogues are pretty clever and neat while story is overall mysterious and involving. There are numerous philosophical reflections of different characters (though mostly superficial). Characters, especially Beiluo and Yun'wuyue, are well-written and charismatic, relationships between them are interesting to explore. Characters design is good and more or less realistic - men and women have different heights here as well as teens. Main characters are aesthetically appealing though Beiluo could be a little more manly (however he is far more manly than most Asian game's protagonists). The downside is that there are not many different characters and many of them look alike. Another major minus is Cen Ying who looks out of place within the game's grim and believable atmosphere. While it's easy to believe in Beiluo's and Yun'wuyue's ability to slain numerous adversaries - after all, they are mighty supernatural beings devoted to harnessing power - Cen Ying's ability to fight almost on the same level with them is quite ridiculous. She's a slim teenage girl after all. This ""kawai"" character is overall unnecessary, boring and ruins immersion into the game. The ""golden glider"" thing was enough ""kawai"" element for this game. But there is positive thing about your companions - they are, especially Yun'wuyue, are actually useful in fights. Not just useless burden like companions in many other games. Gujian3 also has many build-in minigames such as card game, fishing, lock puzzle and kind of economic management where you can hire creatures and people to craft different items and tools, build, cook, explore, mine resources, cultivate crop, etc. You can even build your own mansion here.

As for the minuses, I consider fighting mechanics to be mediocre, reminding of a slasher. The world isn't interactive and player isn't allowed to make choices in dialogues or in other situations (except for few minor choices which will not affect the main plot in any aspect). Character control, especially jumping, is a bit clunky. Some subplots where you're playing for other characters are quite boring since they not introduce different mechanics (maybe except for Yun'wuyue's mission). The screenwriter failed to use unique game's historical setting to more thoroughly unfold in character's actions and dialogues ancient Chinese shamanism as well as Daoism. The game has modern ideological ethos, some weird and illogical mixture of Chinese Legalism with Mohism and Buddhism (that dubious ""reincarnation"" thing). Some dialogues are silly and boring as well as some characters (especially, as I've mentioned before, Cen Ying). The culmination of the game is poorly written and, My main disappointment, Beiluo's and Yun'wuyue's relationships are not properly developed. In the final titles we are proposed to witness some boring ""educational"" pictures and even more boring depicture of Cen Ying's life instead of hints about ""post-game life"" of the main and most interesting characters. Another major minus that some gamers may experience is the problem with saves - the game uses server for savegames and sometimes (certain period during a day) inability of the game to connect to the server becomes irritating. So it might be useful to chose another server for savegames before you start the game.

But all those minuses are pretty minor and easily overlapped by the game's positive sides. The story and main characters of this game are really engaging, making the Gujian3 the best Chinese game that I've played so far and one of the best overall. 8,5/10.",1610308227,1610915313,True,65,2,0.842284500598907471,2,True,False,False

Despite the troubles of trying to steal eggs and capturing poultry, the [i]mini-farming simulator[/i] included in this game can be pretty addictive. Plenty of tasks to do, enough to keep you occupied in the mean time!

[h1][i]Looking for a decent Chinese-themed Fantasy Action/RPG game? Perhaps could give it a try on [b]古剑奇谭三(Gujian3)![/b][/i][/h1]

So how's the main story? I'd say it's really well written although the translation can be a little off sometimes. Like, in some parts it can be slightly confusing to audiences who doesn't know/learn the language. Still, whole translation is alright and understandable. As for the visuals, they are absolutely stunning! I notice I spent a little bit more time wandering around, just enjoying the views, taking screenshots. Even if they're just some random little things, hey that counts too! Personally wants to minimize screenshot uploads on my profile but I just can't help with it! I truly enjoyed every possible explorations. And the environment in towns feels lively.. although some NPCs' dull standstill figure are kind of a flaw. Anyway let's go on to the music; They're all magnificent! I love how good they sound to my ears. Beautifully composed, and they just fits perfectly in each different scenarios. I can feel the characters' pain, sorrow.. even anger, by just listening to these fantastic sounds. Not to forget about the arts, all these fine pieces being used in loading screens are truly breathtaking.

Combat wise is remarkable, fast-paced but also very repetitive. Easy combos and fancy moves. Cons are that they do not have much variants of enemies, especially when all demons look pretty much similar while the designs for other creatures are cool. Boss fights are intense, though their movements are often too easy to read when they do not seem to have good variety of offensive actions. As for the cutscenes, they can be quite long like cinematic movies but I still find it enjoyable as the stories are very engaging while it also can be a good short break in between of repetitive battles. However, the lack of expressions in each characters during cutscenes does make me feel a little uninterested in some point. Nevertheless, these beautiful visuals as well as the uniqueness of the stories are what encouraged me to keep on playing this game. And I enjoyed every hours spent.

Did I mention mini-games earlier? Here's this main thing they have is a Card game which they're called as [b]Lost Tales[/b], some sidequests do be directing you to challenge selective NPCs. They're difficult to understand in the beginning, but you most probably can get the idea on how to execute right combos after multiple tries. Or perhaps look up to a guide created by the community for detailed explaination. It's actually pretty fun as you get better at it. Crafting, harvesting, and mini platformer will be unlocked after you reach certain different stages in the main story. Crafting seemed complicated at first, it'll get much interesting after investing a couple of hours. While crafting does benefit in battles and as well as sidequests, including cosmetics, which makes another good reason for players to anticipate more in crafting. 

As much as I'd want to recommend this game for everyone who loves Chinese-themed Action/RPG but, UNFORTUNATELY, this singleplayer game supports online-DRM thingy which is a huge disadvantage for anyone who just want to enjoy singleplayer games offline, or does not even have a good Internet connection to begin with. That means players' need to stay online just to play a singleplayer game, else it'll be unplayable. To be frank, that can get pretty annoying sometimes. Not to mention the game itself by default will ALWAYS autosave from time to time, there's no way to turn it off, sadly.. if anyone ever had trouble or messed up somewhere can just [b][i]Return to the Title[/i][/b] and go manually [b][i]Load[/i][/b] then lastly select the preferred [b][i]Manual Save[/i][/b] or [b][i]Act[/i][/b]. It's somewhat kind of a hassle but I guess that's still alright in a way. So I'd only recommend this if you don't have any issue with these first few matters, and as for the rest, I guess that relies on your preferences. However, to be fair, it's still a decent game despite the few cons as listed above. Definitely worth the price with the given content, much more affordable at it too! Game's average completion are roughly 70 to 100+ hours, could go way higher if you do everything else including the mini-platformer game and Challenge Mode. It'll be very grindy if you're one of the Achievement Hunters though; take note that the Steam Achievements were not translated.

It's rather sad that many decent looking Chinese-themed RPG are based on MMO and cashgrabs, or only available in one language. I wish there will be more actual good singleplayer Chinese games to be translated in the future, as I know there are plenty underrated gems go unknown to non-Chinese players.",1607880686,1610298598,True,50,8,0.791978955268859863,0,True,False,False

But I feel like I just have to say something here, make an effort to convince people to experience this beautiful game. Last night I finally got all the achievements, so I suppose now's the time.

So, the game is very story heavy, that's granted. There's a lot of cutscenes, and I'm not going to say the pace of the game is slow exactly, but more that it has its own pace; something you'll no doubt get used to. There are 4 Acts, with the game really opening up after you finish the first Act with fast-travel becoming available as well as, 'Lotuscape' which I'll get into a lil'more detail on later. The story's fairly interesting, and the characters are all very likeable; though I wouldn't say they're the strongest points of the game (Yun'wuyue is my favourite! Beautiful and shrouded in mystery). 

Combat's really fluid, and excels far ahead of TW3's combat (which, let's be honest, was pretty braindead lol). If you play on the hardest difficult, Challenge difficulty, the game's actually quite difficult; and featured two of the hardest bosses I've fought in any game. Like, harder than any Dark Souls boss. Easily took over 100 attempts on one of em'. Combat never got boring, and the skill, 'constellation' (basically a skill tree) is big enough for you to keep trying new builds or skill combos well into the game.

The main beauty of the game however, is the music and just how visually beautiful it is. The game never fails to create a befitting atmosphere, and you get completely drawn in. The OST is probably my favourite, and I'd compare this game to the second Assassin's Creed game, and the first Witcher game in that sense. I mentioned the game having a lot of cutscenes: I took most of my screenshots during the cutscenes, so they rarely get boring.

The kind of, 'home base' in this game is a place called, 'Lotuscape'. It's like a... beautiful island? I don't know how to describe it. Super relaxing place with nice music; lots of greenery, waterfalls, ponds and even a hot tub lol All the crafting in the game takes place here, and material gathering is mostly done by things called, 'Pact Creatures'. You gain pact creatures by killing their leader (side quests), and you can send them on adventures to gather materials, into a mine or even catch fish for you. You're also able to grow and harvest crops, as well as go fishing yourself. There's a huge house too with an open area you're able to fully decorate and furnish with hundreds of craftable items. Most recipes you'll learn by researching. When you research something, it consists of playing a small mini-game like in Cooking Mama, but a lot simpler. There's over 70 things to research,  so you won't be running out anytime soon.

Finally, for completionists, this game isn't *that* easy to get all achievements. For one, you have to play on Challenge Difficulty and there isn't that much information out there available in English. It's not undoable though, so don't let this put you off (I don't know the language at all, and I've been able to do it). I've even written my own achievement guide, which you're free to check out. It was an overall extremely satisfying experience, so I still do highly recommend it.

If you're still not convinced, I've made a YouTube video showcasing all my screenshots with my favourite tracks from the game playing over it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbktzwEjtWI&t=30s&ab_channel=Ky%C5%ABGreywolf%E2%80%A0

Here's my short experience/review:

It's beautiful and well made with HEAVY emphasis on story and long dialogues. If you're looking for an action-rpg you might want to look elsewhere.
It does include a kind of base building, hiring workers, crafting, gathering, exploration... customising skills, weapons and appearel... fishing, playing cards etc etc and all those things you might enjoy apart from the story. 

I love the music and the environments, but a bit sad there's so many invisible walls and sealed off places.

The story is somewhat confusing and the game clearly wasn't made for an english audience to begin with. 
(there's a bit of translation errors so be aware of that when you play)

Return character from Gujian 1 can be seen as well which makes the game more interesting. Great job but but the only thing that bothers me as a player. I'm sure that not only me but other players who are experiencing this issues as well 

So whenever i went for a side mission to certain place then suddenly it came out a notice says that the connection was out and unstable and i need to reconnect it, so i reconnect and wait for a bit but still after a bit it still shows the same notice...I had checked my adapter, reconnecting Wifi and stuffs, but still problem occurs

I don't know but maybe the game itself uses too much of internet connection space or storage? If possible i hope Steam or the game server can fix it? so that it wont suddenly went disconnected like before? I even went to steam setting to lower the internet value itself although it is not hurt to try but still it won't do...I hope it will be fix

The story and lore is adequately interpreted to English via subtitles, and there is also a summary of each chapter in the menu as you get there.  Battle mechanics are fluid, and RPG elements are logical and interesting.  

EDIT: OK, I finished the game and it clocked in at near 43 hours.  What began as a strong game and intreesting narrative slowly morphed into a history and folklore lesson of Ancient Chinese culture.  I'm sure it'd be alot more interesting if I understood Chinese, as reading the Subtitles became quite a bore!   About 20 hours in the middle is alot of grinding in dungeons and caves alot of which could have totally been removed from the game.  Basically, for 20 hours, the game just goes sideways without much of anything interesting.

The Witcher is an actual RPG where you participate in dialogues and get to make significant choices in the story. In Gujian 3 you do not get to chose even a little what kind of character Beiluo is, you just follow him down his story. Gujian 3 also isn't an open world game, you switch from area to area and I personally do not consider areas that small as open world compared to games like Dragon Age 3 where the areas are really large. If I had to find games to which  Gujian 3 ressembles I would say it is mixture of Onimusha and Final Fantasy. It's very action oriented like Onimusha, the graphics's style and the story drama are similar to FF though a little darker and the story is extremely linear like both.

Now despite all I've said I still think Gujian 3 is a good game just not the game some reviews lead you to believe it is. I've always thougth there was a lot of potential for good games in a Chinese fantasy or Wuxia setting. In Gujian the cultivation and the different schools of fighting aren't exploited as parts of the system sadly. I reallly believe that a mechanic exploiting cultivation and fighting schools + the ability to actively participate in dialogues and make significant choices could propel a game like Gujian to the top sellers of the RPG genre. And a better translation coudn't hurt, it's good that they are making the effort to try and make the game accessible to the occidental market and the translation does satisfy the minimum requirements but there are still too many grammar mistakes and typos. Without a better translation and at the very least english voiceovers they will be facing a lot of resistance. 

Also sometimes the story gets a bit confusing but I believe the story is simply kind of a stretch and gets hard to believe and follow at some point and that has nothing to do with the translation, it's a writing issue.

Hopefully by Gujian 5 or 6 they will have gotten there (the top of RPG sales).",1603134435,1603134435,True,29,2,0.764991998672485352,0,True,False,False

Downsides:
-anti-piracy save system is annoying
-some people apparently have stuttering (I started getting it in some cutscenes after about 20 hours of gameplay, a bit annoying, but pausing a cutscene for couple seconds and resuming it helps)
-game doesn't start that engaging and first couple hours (I think it takes about 6 to get to what can be considered the main game) feel quite slow
-the crafting part of the English localization needs retranslating
-it involves Chinese culture so you need to have some basic knowledge about that. 
-some of the things introduced aren't used in the game. We are shown how to jump and that we can jump on roofs, but we don't really need that.

Upsides:
+Story and music are great
+locations look amazing. In every location of the game, you can find dozens of places to take pictures which you can easily use as wallpapers. Honestly, the game is a wallpaper generator
+game looks really good generally
+combat is simple but satisfying
+there is actually a lot to do once you get past the first introductory part
+all the missable little extra things
+the game feels like it was made by enthusiastic people who wanted to make it good. Nowadays, you don't get the feeling that often.

OK lets get the positives out of the way

The game is beautiful. Great visuals, interesting environments, grand in scale. From flowing robes and hair, to floating castles, this ticks all the visual design boxes for a game that is partially centered around Chinese fantasy. If you've ever watched (which presumably you have otherwise why you here :) ) chinese flying fantasy type stuff, which deals with chinese mythology, this games visuals are every bit the part. 

But that is as far as it goes. What I mean by this is that the rest of the game is marred by things that could have been done better and just plain head scratching moments that will leave you wondering if the developers ever played the game. Or if they focused too much on visuals and let the rest of the game flounder. Unpolished items leave the game feeling like an indie game, even though it feels as though they were going for triple A. 

Let me explain. First of all they decided (for reasons that are beyond me) that the game needs a consistent network connection. Why? I have no idea. But this should be a worrying sign for you. So far I have played fifty six minutes of the game and just before writing this it informed me that I had lost network connection and that I had only two options, either quit or try to connect again. This was strange since windows and opening up a net explorer showed that I had a solid connection. So why did I lose connection in game? Why no offline mode? Why is there even an online mode? What were they thinking?

Then we have the persistence of pointless loading. Literally you have points where the game will load, just so that it will load again. Like you get a loading screen. Then a cut scene. Then you take a step of two, then you get a loading screen, then a cut scene. Which kind of idiot does that (sorry this is one of my room 101 bug bears). It breaks up the game way too much, hampers flow and pulls you out of the story. Unoptimised mess. So far there have been about four of these monstrosities within the first fifty six minutes.

The combat. Its fun, fluid, action packed and incredibly shallow. Maybe it expands out later but so far it consists of clicking a button a few times to work up a combo then hitting a numerical key to pull of a power move. There are other parts, like blocking and dodging, which is what actually makes it fun, but even then, it already starts to get stale. It has icons on the screen which the game doesn't really explain well. But it doesn't take that long to work it out, but here is where the game makes a cardinal sin of design, it lies. The game promises that when enemies attack it will give you these warnings so that you can take evasive action. But then it fails to do it every time. This is either a bug or bad design. The reason why it's bad design is because it makes the symbols pointless. You might as well not warn the player and just have them muddle it out. This wouldn't be so bad if all the attacks could be seen by the player, but the game includes attacks that are impossible for the player to see (off screen and camera angles not being flexible enough). This then means that you have to rely on the symbols to warn you, but again, this doesn't happen every time. 

Then you have choices. There are none. This is in the typical style of a JRPG, where you, as the player only choose equipment and powers, but the character is ""on-rails"". I was hoping that JRPGs would have grown out this by now, but they haven't. (Yes I know this is a chinese rpg but it is essentially a jrpg, developed by chinese developers, with chinese sprites, but the beating heart is jrpg).

The music is nice. It adds to the air ethereal quality the game seems to be shooting for, flowing instruments making classic chinese fantasy songs. But, and this is more a personal preference, it doesn't seem to ramp up based on what is happening. It stays floaty, even in the face of giant bosses. I thought it would ramp up in bpm, but not really. It keeps the same thread and only really alters some of the harmonies and what not, but nothing gives you an adrenaline dosage through the ears when your expecting it, in accordance with what's going on on the screen.

All in all this game is an ode to chinese mythical fantasy, and in some ways it nails it. But then when it needed departures from that static formula, to make choices about flow and game play, it stubbornly sticks to the formula, which is great for a tv show or movie, but sucks for a game.

Its not worth the price tag, only get it if its under £10. It has some nice ideas, and I get that the developers must have spent ages designing the character looks and the beautiful environments, but that a game does not make, i'm afraid. It needed more, which sadly it lacked.",1601728354,1601728354,False,8,0,0.509981870651245117,0,True,False,False

This game is great! I deliberated about buying it for ages, and I needn't have. It has been fun and exciting from the very beginning and the landscapes are beautiful. The music is fantastic and really sets the mood in every scene. The characters are interesting, individual and humorous. So far in my playthrough, women haven't been portrayed as sex objects but as actual agents with powers and minds of their own! I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPGs.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
Boss fights are challenging and interesting, in that you have to learn their individual move sequences, but combat isn't unreasonably difficult on the normal setting and there are four different settings to choose from. Combat is great because there are lots of fun effects, new skills and finishers to learn; these changed depending on which character you are playing. Fights work really well both with and without target lockon, and the game tells you when target lockon has failed - there is a context to this and it's fun. You have decent stamina from the beginning without needing to grind, and your stamina for running about in non combat mode is greater than when you are in combat mode performing special skills. I find this ideal because it can be convenient or challenging depending on the context. You can pause during fights if you need to take a break, or replenish your character's health with items.

[b] Technical [/b]
There is a lot of detail in the controls, which I like, and I haven't even unlocked all of the possible activities yet. That said, I found I needed to customize the controls from the beginning, because I didn't find the original settings that intuitive. If you have put many hours into Dark Souls, Witcher and Dragon's Dogma then you may want to change the buttons just so that your muscle memory doesn't get too scrambled. The save function was slightly strange in the beginning, but good once I got used to it. There are plenty of autosaves so you shouldn't ever lose too much progress by accident. Regarding language, there are several mistakes in the English translations, but it isn't so bad as to negatively affect your experience of the dialogue and the game in general.

[b] Story [/b]
This game feels very refreshing compared to a lot of RPGs out there. It draws on traditional mythology and folklore and includes excerpts from Chinese poetry and literature in item story fluff, which I really enjoy. There are plenty of story scenes, but at the beginning they are not overly long and you are allowed to get on with the game. You always have the choice of skipping scenes or pausing during them anyway, which is convenient for replays and taking breaks. The art is amazing, particularly the monster gallery and skill constellations; these really add to the atmosphere and help build the narrative.

[b] Before you buy [/b]
Gujian3 is advertised as an open world game. I'm six hours in and I haven't been free to explore yet. However, I think it may just have a very extended prologue because with each new stage of the main quest I am being introduced to new places and the game is gradually bringing in things like shops, crafting, fishing and farming. So it seems like there is a lot to come, and the story has been so fun I let go of wanting to go AWOL and have just been enjoying the ride. However, if you want freedom from the start, this isn't the game for you.

Crafting system itself is like a mini sim game with a lot to do. Need a bit of learning on how to play since no proper guide provided or can be found online (in English). One thing i like is the skill system which you can just change the way you like it. You don't need to really commit the points. You can just remove from one skill and put in another one to try out at any time without any cost. It is good because, u can only have 4 skills active at one time. So, you can try out and if you don't like it can just remove that skill in the skill tree and get another. 
At first, it was a bit confusing. I felt like i was just thrown into the middle of the game without knowing much on how to play. Just follow the story and after quite a few hours, then i start to grasp the gameplay system. Only after I can get access to crafting system, then get the better understanding overall. One problem is that there is no English guide to be found online. Seems like the steam forum is the only place to get help and it is very helpful.

Anyways, Great game very Story Oriented game so if you're are expecting a Final Fantasy expect a less combat & more Story Final Fantasy and that pretty much sums up the game.

A Slight Con is mainly enemy Variety didn't fight a lot of different enemies in fact you fight the same enemies except they have different elements to them, then their are bosses but the only hard boss I fought was Solwrath which you'll figure out who that is when you play the game.
I'd consider a harder difficulty if you want a challenging experience the first time around otherwise it's a very easy game if you've played other Adventure Games with challenging bosses. 

With that being said though it's a Story Oriented game supposedly CRPGS are known for that while JRPGS have a mix of both didn't know that since this is my first CRPG.

I went in expecting pretty graphics and perhaps something to go with it, but damn it delivered in not only very pretty graphics, but in pretty much every other aspect too. So now, I'm instead eagerly awaiting for possible future Gujian -games.

This game is very story-driven so if that is not your jam at all, might wanna hop off at this point. Also, if you are not fan of common Chinese fiction themes and ways of looking at things, there's fair bit of these in the story and the characters, so be warned - or hyped. That being said, the story - or perhaps the delivery of the story - is fantastic. The way the different times and character perspectives slowly unfold the story as we hop from one event to another is great. Areas are very beautiful and varied, some also delectably clever - like 2D-oriented area reeking of references to traditional theatre or being minimized to hop around in tree foliage.

The characters are a big part of the story and another amazing aspect of the game. If you are one for very flashy overblown personalities, most of the characters might not exactly be your cup of tea, but personally the reserved subtleties in the interactions worked very well. There's still a lot of nice different personalities in the whole cast either way, and you don't need to see subtleties to catch that. Combined with the constant character development present in the story, especially in the main group, the characters were really just a joy to behold.

Do note couple things though. To get the best experience in both the story and characters, you will need to do quite a few important side quests, otherwise you are missing out on a lot of nice tie-ups and additional tidbits.

Gameplay is great. The combat feels very fluid, and while not complex, it is easy to approach, but still with subtleties that give it some depth as well. There are quite a few minigames like a great very story-fueled card game or traditional fishing minigame. Hell,  there's a whole homeworld thingy too full of what are essentially different kinds of minigames.

Not only are the graphics pretty, the audio is very beautiful as well, with mainly classically driven pieces ranging from majestic to somber. As befits the game contents, there's often also very clear oriental presence in the instrumentation of the tracks.

This game would be worth the shot at full original 60 bucks price in my opinion, but If you are still doubting whether to buy the game or not, wait for a sale. It used to be in around -70% or -80% sales with the old price, so I'd imagine that with the new price it would still get some -50% or so now and then for that similar 10+ bucks - which is a steal.",1599504496,1599504496,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm amazed, honestly. Never got hooked on a RPG game like this since The Witcher 3.
Awesome story. Featuring Chinese culture and mythology.
Good graphics. Not well optimized, but good enough for me.
Amazing soundtracks. Chillin, relaxing, epic.
Combat is just ok. Not bad, kinda clunky but you get used to it later. It is more about mixing your hack n' slash with action skills to prevent enemies from attacking. Boss fights are kinda meh (with some exceptions).
Language localisation is surprisingly good. I have no problem understanding the story and lore of the game.
Characters customization is really good, but not varied. You can only craft new skins for your weapons and armor. Changing/upgrading them won't change the look of them.

In an industry that values flashy animations and visuals over actual content (Horizon Zero Dawn), this is a rare gem. It's not perfect, not by a long short but it's very unique.

[u] As reviews are mostly subjective based on tastes and preferences, I'll list some of my favorite titles before I get into the rest: [/u] 
[b] Mass Effect 2
Dragon Age Origins
Pathfinder Kingmaker
Divinity Original Sin II
Pillars of Eternity II
Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice [/b]

As you can probably guess, I prefer story-rich games with dense narratives and a rich lore. As such, the RPG genre is my go-to space. While Gujian 3 isn't exactly an RPG (just has some minor RPG elements), it was a real treat.

[h1] Story [/h1]
As far as the story is concerned, I'd give it a 7 or 8 out of 10. The lore and story are really complex. Unlike JRPGs it's not too over the top, but at the same time it isn't easy to grasp either. At times, you'll feel like there are holes in the narrative, but that will depend on how many fantasy RPGs you've played and your definition of realistic. Some of this is also due to the language difference. The original game is in Chinese, and some of the meaning gets lost in translation. Regardless, it's still a tale that will make you scratch your head. The devs have done a really good job by including a lore-book that includes the summary of every character and event known at that point in your playthrough. 

You play as Beilou, the lost prince of a powerful clan of Fey (spirits/good demons) who is forced to ascend to the throne as his brother dies of an injury. Because of the fact that he lived most of his life in the mortal world, he's rather weak with limited spirit powers which is a concern for his subjects as this power helps keep the kingdom safe from demons and other powerful foes. Furthermore, the PC resents his clan as he was abandoned and as such, he tries to live as a mortal, suppressing his powers. 

Through the course of the game, you learn about the Shadowchasers (the clan), the ancient history of both the mortal and spirit world and how it has affected the present settings. You'll simultaneously play from two prespectives: one modern and one ancient which can really muddle things. I suggest keeping an eye on the lore-book. 

[h1] Gameplay and Characters [/h1]
The characters are interesting and well fleshed out. Their backgrounds are properly detailed and their development is dynamic through the course of the game. Before you ask, yes this is a party-based action hack-n-slash with limited equipment upgrade paths and customization. 
The crafting system is quite complicated. First, to craft you need schematics which can be obtained by researching. This can be done on your personal homestead, called the Lotuscape. You'll need minions, materials and resources for both researching and crafting.
The frustrating part about researching is that it requires you to play a mini-game where you need to guess the correct way to craft the given object. This can get really tedious as some of the things will be quite foreign to most players. Furthermore, if you fail one step, the entire process is screwed and the resources are wasted. To make matters worse, your minions have a stamina bar which gets depleted every time you craft or research something. I'd be fine if this recharged over time, but it doesn't. You need to give them food or it'll stay depleted. This was one of the primary flaws in the gameplay.

The second one is with respect to the side-quests. While some of them are quite well-designed with an aim to discover the characters' past and future motivations, the rest are there to merely earn money and XP. You need to craft random stuff for clients or fish/collect resources for which you are paid in gold. These can get fairly boring, with little to no motivations to resolve. For example, some quests will ask you to find a certain herb or fish but you'll have no idea where it's found. Sometimes, even combing through the entire map is of no use. A few items are ""special"" and can only be acquired in a particular region or via a quest. 

[h1] Combat [/h1]
The combat is one of the more enjoyable aspects of the game. It's fluid, stamina-based with a set of attack-skills and a super-skill. It's not as difficult as Dark Souls, but isn't easy to master either. The game gives you rough hints as to when an enemy will attack and which of them can be parried and which can't. You have a wide set of moves available to you depending on the combo multiplier. 
There's a massive skill tree which lets you improve your stats and unlock new moves, and at the same change how some of them function. 
The combat is most similar to Final Fantasy XV, albeit it's more fluid and fast-paced.

[h1] Visuals and Soundtrack [/h1]
Gujian 3 is a really beautiful game and on top of that, it runs quite well too. I'd put it on the same level as Final Fantasy XIV, although certain aspects like the shadows and lighting are quite basic screen-space effects. There's also no v-sync option in-game which is necessary if you running on a decent system as you'll easily get 80-90 FPS at ultra. Enforce it from the control panel.
The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Most of the music is instrumental, slow paced with heavy use of the violin, flute and similar string-based ones. Other than the combat music, the overall ambience and atmosphere is really relaxing. 

[h1] Conclusion and PS [/h1]
If you are into story-rich games especially RPGs and JRPGs, I highly recommend checking this one out. If nothing else, it's a very unique game. However, there is one thing that really needs work is the naming. While the core translation is excellent, the names are all in Chinese and to a non-native, they all sound very similar. As such, you'll get confused quite often and be forced to check the lore-book repeatedly to differentiate between the various characters and locations. This will primarily be an issue for Western players.",1599000929,1599172030,True,15,1,0.631458461284637451,0,True,False,False

It's just a lot of the connective narrative tissue is lost in translation. I really rather enjoyed my time with Gujian 3. It was quite the lengthy game clocking in for me around 40 hours. And i really didn't do many of the side quests, or play the collectable card mini game or finish the Captain Toad inspired puzzle mini game.

CONS
I was hoping this game would be more roaming/exploring/killing, but it has a much stronger RPG tone.
It felt more like a movie than a game; out of 11hrs playing this game, I probably spent 6hrs watching cutscenes or skipping conversations.

I have to say, this game is surprisingly good story wise, yet it is not well known.
I did not regret buying it, and looking for the 4th game.

Little critism for the fellow gamers who is looking for buying this game.

This game is heavily story driven - and has a good one! - which you rarely can truly interfere, nor change the tides of the story flow. After the first 3-4 hours of the story, it'll quickly become stale, and i admit i actually took a month break from the game before i was willing to pick up again and play it. It is definitelly worth, and you get a slide from the chinese mithology and their way of thinking and psychology.


The combat is very minimalist until you don't get hand on a few abilities, but it'll still turn tiresome after a few hours, mainly because of lack of diversity among common enemies, and how repetitive is. You'll slain common enemies 97% of the time, as there are trully a few boss fight in the game at best.

Graphic wise the game is amazing, and it knows it as it has built in Screenshot editor (default access in the game via F2). There is a few place which is breath taking on max setting - as i'm using a certain world's smoldering flower field as live wallpaper on my pc (not mentioning the place to avoid possible spoilers).

The music definitelly builds-up the atmosphere with the landspace, and the ending's music have been added to my tracklist.

Gameplay wise it's mostly completing quest, and side question, with trully minimal exploring as most place you gain access only if you progress in the story.

Biggest negative in the game: There are cutscenes, a lot of them which is not bad in a story-driven game, but they're sometimes placed awkwardly. You get into a scene, it is over and you're given back control of your character and then you barely do 2-3 step and you're in a cutscene again.

There are random triggers (smash W, or D or A several times) also in the fighting cutscenes, which can catch you off-guard which can result you dying/suffering a lot of damage.

Overall, I'd say this is a decent game with a good story to tell, but it is an only-time playable game due of the story-driven aspect.

I never get bored listening to the story or taking my time reading the lore about the world I'm in. It's so very interesting and good. The energy feeling I felt through out never faded. 

The combat is also good. Teaching you and helping you to understand of how to fight. Learn and master the way of sword fighting in the combat is really good. I put the difficulty as high as I could. To see if it is balanced on the hardest setting and it is, really well done. Feeling strong but not overpowered. Feeling skilled but so much to learn. 

There also fun mini games. One of my favorites is the card game. Simple but hard.

When you start playing its lots of fun with a good mix of adventuring, combat and story driven cut scenes. Its good up to the half way mark. After that it suddenly turns into cut scene hell. With that I mean that large portions of the last half of the game you are watching more cut scenes than actually playing. Its more or less cut scene - control you char for 10 seconds - new cut scene - combat scene - new cut scene rinse and repeat until the game is almsot done. Then at the final stretch you get some more playtime between cut scenes. For me this is a huge draw back since its feel like I'm not playing a game anymore. Also at the later half you got lots of side stuff to do that you have to remember to do in those short gaps between cut scenes which breaks the flow of the story. But you do not have much choice if you want to complete other activities as well. Some will probably note that this is a story driven game and many cut scenes helps telling the story and I agree to som extent. Its just that the story could be told just as good with fewer cut scenes instead of doing the cut scene - 10 second playing - cut scene routine. But this is also the only thing that I find negative with this game and its not a problem if you dont mind having lots of cut scenes. 

The story is good and could easily been a Chinese fantasy movie instead of a game. The combat is also good albeit a bit reptitive. However its difficult to do much about this since you cant have unique encounters everywhere. Just make sure your sprint/dodge is mapped to a button you use often :P
The questlog could be better and at times is a bit frustrating However its ok that your not being handheld through every single quest like many games do these days. It only should be a bit easier to/more logical to find back to information said in cut scenes that may hold important clue. Quest texts are quite short with little information and if you decide to do a detour (side quests/lotuscape) you may find it hard to come back to the main quest at a few times because of the lack of information in quests.
The voice acting feels a bit flat and doesnt convey much feeling. At some times it feels like they are just reading the script like robots not giving real life to the scenes. 
I know many have asked if the english is good and besides a few typos its good enough.
The soundtrack is quite good and helps uping the atmosphere in the game. 
 
The game runs with no issues for me. I encountered no crashes or other issues.  The game isnt super demanding but the fps will go up on down depending on how many details there is on the map. Not talking about textures but things like flowers, trees etc The game is also capped at 100 fps it seems. I had in 80% of the game 100 fps (using rtx2080) and fell to 70 fps on a few places where there are lots of flowers. I play with everything on max and 1440 resolution.

All in all I think this game can be recommended to people who likes story driven games and dont mind lots of cut scenes. Also for people who likes eastern fantasy worlds should pick this up. 
But if you dont like games with many cut scenes then dont get this. You will probably never finish the game or skip every scene and miss the story.",1597168919,1597168919,True,4,0,0.514285683631896973,0,True,False,False

- Always online mode in a single player game. I cant play right now because the Chineese government says so. Seriously?!?
- Cut scenes that would freeze the game. Had to restart the game and skip the scene.
- Too much back tracking.
- Combat is not very deep. You get a sword. That is it. Variation comes from skills and team mates you unlock later.
- Quick-time-events. Sometimes it felt like I was back in the 90's.

The game design and pacing is in many ways very similar to FFVII Remake or FFX.  A linear experience with side questing time interspersed with the main content.  There are a lot of lengthy cutscenes and lots of jargon that might get in the way if you get hung up on those kinds of things.

+ The graphics are beautiful with some lower quality environment assets carried by fantastic art design.  
+ The story is pretty standard Wuxia fare for anyone who watches a decent number of martial arts films or CDramas, but this is not a setting often used in video games, so it still comes across as pretty original and unique imo.
+ Combat animations are beautiful.
+ Environment design is really good, and at times extremely creative.
+ Character writing is great with no real cringey dialog or characters.  Even the cute mascot characters come across as endearing.
+ Game is long and feels like it justifies its runtime.
+ Game performs well overall, I am running it at ~1800p + 60 fps at max settings on an Radeon RX 5700 XT + Ryzen 3800x.
+ Lotuscape city building minigame is relaxing and addictive.
+ The game is FULLY voiced, and all the voices are pretty solid.  I don't have a great ear for Chinese, but I thought all the voices fit their respective characters very well.

- Side quests are hard to navigate and not very good for the most part with a few more plot relevant standouts.
- Minor translation errors all over the place and some awkward dialog.  Not enough to ever bother me, but I could see this annoying some people.
- Combat is quite button-mashy though super stylish.  It has some challenge, but in general this is not super in depth.
- In a game with gorgeous environments and towns its a shame you spend by far the most time in the most boring one one in the whole game.
- Second half of the game re-uses a good deal of the environments, but never enough to feel super tiring imo.
- Learning new recipes in the Lotuscape is some BS and poorly designed.  I like the little mini-games you play but the scoring system is too harsh and honestly feels unfinished as if you make a single mistake no matter how good your team is you fail and lose all invested resources.

Overall this game really surprised me, and I would strongly encourage anyone who is vaguely interested in seeing the kinds of experiences coming out of the budding Chinese industry to pick this up.

PROS:
- Good story, extremely amazed by its storyline and its characters 
- Combat system is like FF15 not too hard to get used to 
- Difficulty is very challenging the more higher you go
- Music & voice acting are very well done, especially during emotional scenes
- Worth to buy in full price (But tbh, if you want to save your money, wait for the sales)
- Another good wuxia game on Steam (Like the: 軒轅劍外傳穹之扉 (The Gate of Firmament)

CONS:
- Pick your server correctly as I do tend get connection issue during my gameplay
- Cutscene heavy (As expected of Wuxia games)
- Some of the quests are very confusing, such as finding an item that you need to unlock by researching in Lotuscape
- SOME quests are very missable, and they tend to be part of the achievements also, so complete them before your main quest (But you can always go back to that point after you finished the game)
- The steam achievements are in Chinese but the in game is in english?? (Did they forgot to translate:lol:)

It plays a lot like you would expect of an RPG with a crafting system that is not too bloated and complex to be engaging but is not simple enough to be annoying. The combat is fast paced and engaging and the graphical style is beautiful and pairs well with the soundtrack, which is worth the added price as DLC. 

Though a Western audience may find the characters to be sparse and the storyline to be confusing, this is only because it relies on tropes that are different from those used in Western RPGs to tell its story. I found the new tropes refreshing, especially in a genre where heroes are encouraged to give up on their powers and return to normalcy by a morality system that lauds this as a virtue. Beiluo's character arc revolved around accepting that he is NOT a mortal and that he will never be satisfied with his life or truly fulfilled until he accepts that he is extraordinary, and the path that Cen Ying follows in being influenced by both Beiluo and Ji'Xuanyuan exemplifies the value of both hard work AND ambition while acknowledging the frailty of human life. I also found the romance between Yun'wuyue and Beiluo to be extremely satisfying to watch unfold, though it's nowhere near as graphic as what fans of The Witcher and Dragon Age games may have come to expect. 

If you want a solidly built RPG with engaging and challenging gameplay and an interesting crafting system that will immerse you in the world and perhaps open your mind to a different culture's storytelling practices, this game is more than worth the under $30.00 price tag as its content density is comparable to larger Western RPGs.

Cons:
GUI & Tutorial - You will have to google how to switch to english language, many mechanics are poorly explained and can be unintuitive, however I've managed to figure out most of things without any guides(aside from language selection), but I can see many people being frustrated by it.
Network connection - The game stores your saves on the server. This is a fairly poor choice, given there's no online content, and if there's network issues prepare for lots of soft freezes when attempting to autosave (no selection to disable autosave either, or at least I couldn't find it). Also when starting on one server (i.e. asian/american) you won't be able to load saves from another. 
English translation - Let's say, it wasn't properly proofread and fairly often you won't really get what characters are trying to say. Given the nature of the story and original culture, this might leave you puzzled, but at least it's comprehensible.

Neutral:
Management/crafting system - can be frustrating at times, especially when you need to do research, can't find correct resources, have to switch to a certain menu to feed your workers, but is rather pretty and entertaining otherwise. 
Sidequests - More of a tasks than any quests, really. Most fall into 'bring me 10 pieces of whatever' or play card game. Which would also go here, given its basics.

Pros:
Combat - It's fast and fluid, you have a set of 4 selectable skills, 2 ways to avoid damage - dodge and block. Every enemy has unique skills and patterns, and even if they lack in variety, they still have plenty of thoughts put into them. There's plenty of bosses and most of them are unique. The complexity is on the level of dark souls 1, but the speed of combat is closer to sekiro, which can often result in quick death (at least on highest difficulty). 
Leveling system - given the game's nature it has one of the best skill trees in a linear action rpg games I've seen. Your party members also have skill trees, and those are meaningful, even if you don't utilize them all the time.
Art style - Visuals are very nice, nature looks great, characters look original, cities show a good amount of work put into them. Naturally, you will be seeing a lot of chinese/asian culture and dresses, so if you are interested in it, then it's a plus.
Story & Lore - It's very strong, but also very oriental. The story and lore intertwine by the end and each major character gets a lot of spotlight. I will also note a lore section in the menu, which does a very good job to provide lots of character and monster details. 

In the end, the closest comparison I would draw is a witcher 1-2, except that instead of tons of good sidequests you get a great combat and some base management. If you are willing to give a try to the unconventional non-western, non-japanese game, this one certainly worth about twice of its price.",1596227755,1596227904,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

After a few hours you can piece enough together to understand the main gist of it but there are quite a few scenes where information is delivered and its assumed you know the context.  The Spirit world and Mortal world plot are kind of separate for a bit, but end up intertwining a few times.  I thought it was pretty good and the unfamiliarity I had with the context made it much more engaging then the standard Fantasy Britain concepts.

Combat: So, for starters it feels like a MMO, but like an MMO you can brute force it for most of it and the game feels like a slog when it could be much faster.  Always updating equipment when you can and filling out the accessories slot help way more then you expect.  The combat itself is single weak/strong attack, with guard and dodge.  You have sword skills, Team skills, and Pact skills, and when actively using all three you can really make the combat a breeze.  I went from dodge rolling everywhere and always having a hard time to learning to guard, attacking to interrupt enemies, using team/pact skills, and figuring out the timings better to make combat easier.

Side Quests: Okay, so most of the side-quests are “I want 10 of X” so you deliver it and get cash.  Sometimes the person is a blacksmith/carpenter/tailor etc and then you recruit them to work for you.  There are some more story involved like chatting with a NPC but not too many.  The only issue is many side quests are missable once the game moves on to the next act.  You have no warning or indication at all.  The only thing I could suggest is to revisit every area after any major story beat to check quest-boards and look for any side quest icons on the map.  SkyElk in particular I didn’t visit until too late and missed the first 7 quests in the area and from what I saw they are much more in depth then the village quests.

Translation: Decent, passable but not great.  There are several times where it seems like they are referring to different things but it turns out to just be multiple names for the same person.  It seems like some of them are literal translations which look awkward in the dialogue.  I’ve seen a couple of misspellings as well that only make it more unclear.  This is especially bad for the researching mini-game, where it asks specific questions you need to answer and it’s not clear what they refer to.  Overall the bulk of it is makes sense and is easy to follow there’s just a handful on confusing parts that you’ll figure out from context later anyways.

Base-Building: When I discovered this it went from decent game to God Mode.  The whole base area is set up really well and super easy to navigate.  There’s a dedicated menu to use to manage the NPCs that makes running the whole thing very easy to figure out.  The auto-assign option also works great to rapidly assign whole groups to tasks.  Easily one of the best varieties of this kind of thing I’ve played.  You can go full Animal Crossing on the mountain top and build out and decorate your housing area with a couple hundred options.

Other Content: There’s the card game, Lost Tales, which is pretty easy no need for advanced strategy but takes a while to learn the cards and ideal combinations.

Great effort by an obviously ambitious dev team.

For people who are curious, I'd describe it sort of similar to a modern Final Fantasy type game, in terms of narrative style, map layouts and kind of in regards to it's combat. The combat feels like kind of like modern Final Fantasy, but it's got shades of various hack and slash titles and it's bosses clearly take cues from the Souls genre.

My only complaint so far is a few obvious cut corners with the animation in certain instances(such as when a character picks something up) and the translation while overall good, could use some fine-tuning.

I want to clarify with the animation in that it's not necessarily unintentionally bad animation, but moreso the developer being fully aware of its own limitations and simplifying otherwise intricate motions that pertain to rather insignificant actions.

Story is interesting enough, the thing i like about Wuxia related theme is that romance are always intertwined nicely into the story, without being overly cheesy or in yo face.
You can customize the accessories which is new and interesting.

Storyboard? Cameraman? (idk what it's called) feels weak. You don't feel much emotion or impact from meeting a boss or conversation. Sometimes I don't know what the heck is happening because it feels disjoined. Like reading a manga that missing a few panels.

It is however without flaws. 

Like:
o Aesthetically beautiful, environments are varied enough
o Characters are different from the usual JRPG. I like the non-exaggerated take on the conversations where no one screams every minute
o No performance issues during the whole playthrough of the story
o It's quite beefy with content for the price it offers
o There is a fishing and card mini-game if you're into it
o Every cutscenes are dubbed

Neutral
o The translations are understandable but needs improvement
o The quest markers may sometimes be confusing (You thought that you are near your destination but turns out you need to make an x number of turns/platforming before you can get there)
o The auto save prompt is not accurate (You have to manual save sometimes just to be sure especially on boss fights or you lose a lot of progress)
o Platforming is not enjoyable. It feels like jumping while running or walking makes no difference. With how confusing the maps are sometimes, I wish they just didn't add this at all

Dislike
o The combat gets old fast 
> Lacks monster variation: You literally fight the same monster from Area 1 up to the Last Area consistently. Sometimes the game mix and matches the combination of monsters but after a few battles, you probably already master the combat since even the move sets are the same, with only their stats getting higher as you progress.
> The skill tree is lackluster: At first you might think it's interesting but then you realize some skills just puts you at a disadvantage because of their long animation times, doesn't help monsters hit like a truck. You can animation cancel with dodge but then DPS will be lower which makes them pointless to upgrade. With how the skill bar works in this game, I just find it more useful to use the initial skills given to beat the game.
> The boss fights are fun at first but then after a few encounters, you'll notice they recycle the i-frame mechanics a lot (bosses disappearing in the map so you have to wait/dodge before you can attack again), making it a chore.
o The research system (Where you have to research an item first before you can craft it) is grindy and annoying. It's more of a trial and error than relying on common knowledge. Failing means you lose your resources. I just google all the steps to avoid wasting my resources since early on, you are really scarce on them.


Despite all cons, I enjoyed the game. I do hope the developers step up on their next installment.

Would you believe i haven't played this game yet? All this time i was trying to find ways to avoid crashing to black screen which forced me to turn-off my PC and turn it on again. It even crashed while in the main menu and doing nothing. I nearly wanted to request for a refund seeing that it randomly crashed at the main menu. Later i found out why it had been happening; [b]the desktop resolution must match the in-game resolution.[/b]

There are many graphics options you can tweak but there is no V-Sync option, it defaults to off and that's probably the crucial reason why it crashed to black screen while idling at the main menu; the GPU overheated. [b]Setting V-Sync to ""always on"" in the GPU driver app[/b] eliminated the overheating problem. Also setting Chill mode to ON further reduces heat but also limits FPS to 30. This can be toggled OFF at anytime to raise FPS to 60 as needed.

I don't like the always online requirement for a single player game but it was offered at a very low price during the Summer Sale so i took the chance. More detailed review later. Tentatively, it's a yes because of the many graphics options.

[h1]Update 1[/h1]
Couldn't limit the frame rate to 60 fps anymore when Chill mode is off. Game limit is 100 fps and overrides GPU driver setting.

Game still crash but this time only at the first boss fight so far. [b]Changing this to not recommended for users of AMD hardware.[/b]

[b]Update 2[/b]
Still crash at the first boss fight before the fight starts. Totally not recommended for AMD users.

[b]Update 3[/b]
This game is only playable at half power half capacity of AMD Radeon GPU i.e Chill mode 30 fps, Normal mode 60 fps or higher i.e 'Chill off' would unlock fps to 100 despite V-Sync On at 60 Hz but the fps would be fluctuating and this would cause a crash at boss battles.

In the end only recommended half-heartedly and only if you don't mind your Radeon GPU not operating at its peak performance.

The boss fights are well done, each one posing a different set of mechanics that you have to learn to tackle to beat them which provides for good feelings of achievement once they've been mastered.

Now for the negatives: the game lacks consistently good translations in places where you need technical information.  The crafting system itself is rife with translations that either don't make much sense as an english speaker, or are just plain wrong.  The research system itself is very poorly thought out and the minigames you 'play' seem largely in place to only annoy rather than provide any good gameplay.  Fortunately the research and crafting system is largely superfluous and you can mostly bypass it, although it's the only way to gain access to armors and accessories in the game.

[b]This game is even better of some AAA titles of big companies that are being released in the past years . [/b]

This game has everything his genre needs and some aspect are even well done.

Story is rich and nice  it start 'empty' but while you play it became more interesting since everytime you progress in the story you learn new things that help you to understand better the story around the characters and the main story as well.

Graphic is good nothing real but for its style is nice and landscapes and maps (it is not an open world game) are very well done and beautiful to see,with tons of details on structures,costumes that gives to you the atmosphere of  ancient china mixed with its tales book,this last is what the game is based after all.

Characters models are good  especially the main ones even the details on clothes is something of positive.

Craft and building system are present in game nothing compared to a sandbox game but is good enough

Combat as well skill system is not so complex but is well done and funny with enough skill to choose for every main characters.

Minigames   are also present .

there is only ONE problem that could put off some people in buying the game and is that the game need internet connection to SAVE ,so without a stable connection probably you wont have a good experience this is a problem even because there is no way to play the game offline. 
For people with stable connection it should not be a problem tho.

in the end i suggest this game, since its worth its price especially if like me you will buy it on sale.

In these years where gaming are filled with cash grab multiplayer mode and microtransiction  ,this game is a fresh air for who like me loved old games where making a  fun game and telling good stories  was the first priority for  devolepers beside making money",1594943554,1594943763,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of if you want to buy and play this you need to know this:
- this game needs a stable internet connection with CHINA if u don't have u can have some issues, becouse every save is on their cloud.
- this games have 2 good points that u would want to play it, if u don't like them don't buy it:
   - gameplay is very fluent and dynamic that makes in enjoyable, but because it's dynamic it is 
     kinda bipolar, it mostly is too easy on normal dificulty and on like max 3 fights is too hard and 
     u will spam heal items because u can and u will have many of them, so it isn't  easy to 
     balance that type of gameplay, still it's very nice
   - the story is it's second best part, if u can't read fast or just hate the chinese voice u can just 
     don't waste your time, because chinese is very fast language and u need to read fast to read 
     it and because its' a chinese game it's harder to understand for non chinese, so translation isn't the best. Even thought most of the time u can understand it, still imo smb who translated it had a very rought job and did it good, not the best, but good enought.

Pros:
- great story, it's slow at start but then it becomes more interesting (ending is kinda dissapointing, but if u think of why and what this game stands for it is fiting). Btw i wouldn't name this story ""rich story"" but it itsn't shallow or just general story of saving the world.
- gameplay is very dynamic and fluent that makes it very enjoyable (but becouse of that it's hard to balance, u either smash enemies and they can't do anything or have to less time to dodge or do anything and then have to small stamina and need to chug heal items, even thought on normal dificulty it didn't happen often)
- graphics are nice and this game like to show it to you by marking some places for a landscape view of camera, but tbh it's the style of flashy and good body but very poor details, shadows, antyaliasing and wather are kinda bad.
- it has a very big instances that are very fiting and atmospheric, not like in other games that just give u small town or forest and it's the major city and great forest, nor like some of ea games that are just empty. But still some caves could be smaller ;p
- the music is fiting to, i wouldn't say it's memorable or great but it's perfect for this game

Cons:
- MINIGAMES ARE TRASH. Besides one that is to seal off some chest or passages which is fine, rest are garbage, but they are optional besides turtorial (thanks god).
This game have a ""home"" crafting system, that u will need to hire people, feed them and when they craft items they lose hp, but to craft most items u need to research them that is next minigame that is just bullshit and if u fail u mostly lose all items that it needed. It is very grindy
- If u want to have better skins or armor or upgrades u need to grinde for them (they can be only crafted), becouse armor at shop will be capped eventually around 10k per armor, that isn't much, even thought I didn't need better than it to complete the game easly.
- Side quests are made to 2 categories: questboards - bring me 5 carps etc and like 2-5 true sidequests with some story, but even them have like 1-2 objectives and they are done.

It took me 39h to beat but i tried to do all sidequest not questboard and some crafting.
Overall this game is nice, it still needs improvments and it would be great, but from what i read nothing like that will ever happend. 
8/10 for a great story and very enjoyable gameplay.

After so many bottlenicks, and forgiving the game over and over for its great combat system, I just cant do it anymore. Many times I reach a tough boss, I cant go back to level,upgrade or buy stuff. Some bosses are so tough and unfair.

- Moderate to hard difficulty even at normal so it's challenging enough especially at boss fight, enemies including bosses have attack patterns so can't just button mashing to win and have to observe their atk patterns to save consumables. Recovery items are expensive, so explore and looting have its incentive and can't just spam consumables to win (maybe can but in a game like this I always preserve money and consumables for later battles/gearing up). After failing many times in a boss fight, the fight becomes easier because we'll notice the atk patterns at some point, its fun and frustrating at the same time, but when finally win a boss fight, it is very satisfying especially in a fluid battle. A boss fight can be hard/super easy/quick/slow depending on how we react and throw in combos inbetween enemies atk patterns, a successful dodge to an atk also feels satisfying. 
TL;DR balanced and challenging gameplay and item economy.
- Good Graphics and voice acting.
- Different Lore than Western RPGs giving new atmosphere and vibe. Chinese ancient era has two settings, Wuxia and Xianxia, this is more Xianxia which involves gods, monsters/demons, magic, etc while Wuxia is more about cultivations for superpower.

What I don't like :
- maze maps.

Also because i was interested in Chinese mythology. I will not recommend this game to those who have weak pc. My problem being not being able to play full screen with a 720p resolution. There are two options in the setting windowed with resolution slide and fullscreen with no slider and which runs the game at my monitor resolution which is set at 1080p thus making the game unplayable for me. If there was a resolution slider for the fullscreen option this won't be a problem and I would be able to play it at a stable 30fps. And yes I could lower my monitor resolution to match the game but this I am not willing to sacrifice. I really wish the devs would fix this but considering how old this game is its very unlikely. So I am get a refund and i won't be back to this game before i get a better pc. I really had high hopes for this game. So take this to NOTE!

So i saw one of my friendlist play this game, never heard this game before. So in free time i check the store page, well the pic/video rather normal, so i added it to my wishlist, summer sale, i bought it.

Graphic absolutely outstanding, tried high but i got around 30fps (high graph is so beautiful) now i play at mid still beautiful though)
Battle rather hard (im bad at game) so i got help with app T. and i enjoy the game.

The combat is fun if not a little rough and unforgiving.  Healing is a pain.  There is not hot keys for it so when you heal your steal being hit and that makes healing useless.  Plus there is so many other things wrong.  Like the map is bad and I do mean bad.  Sure it shows you the spot with a green circle where you ""suppose"" to go.  But you spend minutes if not hours trying to find it.  Cause there is guide no help, no quest info, no nothing.  This is your quest it is in the circle have fun.

Finally bit the bullet and took some time to beat this game. Gotta admit I'm quite impressed by the amount of work and care the developers have put into making this game.

First of all, this game was not developed by an AAA studio. So don't expect Witcher 3 quality. But the developers would build some amazing set pieces just for story sequences that you cannot re-visit after. You can really feel their commitment to making this game as great as possible, and the effort they put in.

Yeah sure the game has some QoL issues that annoyed me, but fundamentally it's a great game built with immense care. I don't love this game, but I'm not disappointed. A very humble, honest and generous effort made by the developers.
_______________________________________________


Update: 

Holy crap the QoL aspect of this game is shit! No proper quest tracking. No on-screen quest marker. And the way mini map does not rotate with your camera just triggers me to no end. What the hell is this shit? 1990s?

I mean I'd still play this game, since there aren't many games like this one on the market atm. But man is it annoying at times.

OG review:

Only played about 8 hours so far. A few first impressions:

+ Decent real-time combat system. Although it can get a little repetitive at times, the real-time combat actually feels pretty good. And that's pretty rare for Chinese RPGs.

+ Amazing art direction and environment design. After playing so many western RPGs, a Chinese RPG with good artworks is a nice change of pace.

+ Great music. No complaints here.


- Sound effects kinda suck.

- Not a big fan of the writing and dialogues. Sometimes the dialogues are so cringy that they feel like they were written by a 7-year-old.

- Voice acting can be better. Half the time I can't tell the characters apart by their voices.

- UI is not intuitive at all. And the only way to manually save the game is quick save. Sucks.


Still, overall this game exceeded my expectation. Plus I got it on discount for like $5. Totally worth it.",1584507093,1593824482,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

       The language may be a bit weird at first but you get used to it.I don't understand much of the story but this is one of those games that makes you simply go with the flow and enjoy exploring the world and seeing the characters interact.Their fantasy genre is a bit different from ours and certainly a fresh breath if you are bored of the same magic and dragons and elves that every story seems to have.

       Visuals are gorgeous.The character models are pretty and detailed and the landscapes are lovely.They make for some artsy screenshots too!Animation is fine, a bit mechanic in some places, but never bad.Combat seems easy and spammy at first but it becomes more difficult, especially at bosses (but you can always lower the difficulty if you are willing to take the shame).

I really enjoy this game. I’m not all the way through it at the moment, but wanted to leave a review as I am that impressed. The game reminds me a lot of the Witcher 2 in the sense that it is not some sprawling technical marvel but the developers did an amazing job keeping the scope reasonable, which really let them put together a fantastic game.

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Lovely combat, not crazy complex but more than enough to keep you entertained
- Gorgeous setting, with very vibrant locations
- Plot is really pretty good (I’m not familiar with Chinese fantasy but nonetheless its entertaining)
- There’s a codex/ lore menu that is really useful for filling in some blanks here and there 
- Soundtrack is amazing! Voice acting is really good as well (I’m not a Chinese speaker but it sounds great to me)
- There’s a build a small village for additional resource collection thing that feeds into a research/ crafting loop that is really enjoyable once you get it setup and rolling.
- Seems to run very well on my PC, never had any notable performance issues (also supports my ultrawide resolution)

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Occasional translation issues, nothing major as 99% of the time its fine and even when it occurs its completely understandable.
- Animations can be stiff/weird looking outside of combat (combat animations are great)
- Side quests are rather bland, mostly just fetch quests, kill quests or play the card game with NPC quests. (Good news is they are also pretty easy to do when you need money)

Even though the main language of the game may sound weird at first but its not very hard getting used to it. You have a good skill tree it's enough for the entire game and you can put the skill point and get it back anytime you want. Story line is better than the most of the overrated games. Maps are very unique and alive. Even when you pause the game the background like the wind that touches plants continues. This game has it's own little card game as a mini game and it's very easy to play and it's fun. Crafting system is a bit hard but in this game you have your own little island and you can create buildings, farms and you can send the creatures that you defeated in the battle to fishing or mining. Crafting is silly and fun, when you try to craft, something like a little cute golden flying squirrel appears and you start to play as a golden squirrel til the crafting gets completed. Its very fun running around as a golden squirrel who helps artisans and brings water while answering the questions like ''What should i do to make this outfit cooler''. 

To sum up i can say that this game is very unique and heavily under rated. Good story, good music, good map. fun crafting system.

You could call this a chinese Witcher 3  and you wouldn't be far off.  The combat is top notch and the story isn't too awful, even though the English translation is quite rough.  If you have any interest in chinese history or culture, you will find lots to love here.  

There's tons of stuff to do in this game so it's never boring, the quests are well thought out but it's difficult to understand their structure, some are timed and they don't tell you they are.  The interface also makes it difficult to see which quest you are on, and which are completed.    A very Asian approach to making simple things needlessly complex, I see this in JRPGs all the time.  It's annoying and It takes some getting used to, but the quests are well done for the most part.  Oh, and I hope you like cut-scenes lol...they are well done though, and enhance the story.   I enjoyed it, and hope to finish it one of these days.  It is an RPG I can definitely recommend.

One word of warning:  The game utilizes online-only DRM, so you have to be connected to the companies' server to play.  If you are not online, this game will not work  Make sure you choose NA server and not the chinese one or you'll be constantly disconnected.

Also wanted to see how far Chinese RPGs have come over the years. Overall I would rate the experience as mediocre. 

The good: Great looking graphics both technically and artistically. Some impressive level designs. Core combat mechanic is solid. The base building aspect of the game has decent amount of depth and provides good rewards. Well polished with almost no bugs.

The bad: The plot and characters is one of the weakest of any Chinese RPGs I've ever played. Humourless, emotionless and pretentious. I feel like over half of game's dialogue is expositions explaining events and history of the game's universe. This is the number one reason I cannot recommend this game. A lot can be forgiven when the dev is a small Chinese studio without AAA budget but story is the one thing that you can get right without a big budget.
Most enemies have simple attack patterns and that include most of the bosses too. A lot of enemies and bosses like to teleport around or even turn invisible which makes combat more annoying than challenging.
Game mechanics are all over the place. You'll get quick time event on one boss then no QTE for another five hours and then the game suddenly remembers it's still a thing...
There are a lot of mini games and they are almost universally unenjoyable. The trivia mini game is probably the worst mini game of all mini games.

I've seen this compared to dark souls, but the difficulty is much lower. The battle mechanics are more reminiscent of The Witcher, with more rpg mechanics (constellation tree similar to FFX) and some base building (a la Ni No Kuni 2). It's pretty story heavy, but the balance of cutscenes and gameplay is pretty good. It also has what every good game needs - fishing and a card game.

Just finished my first playthrough.

PRO:
This is a great game. Really enjoyable story with 40-60h of gameplay ahead of you. Characters grow on you, and develop as you play. I didn't want the adventure to end. Action and combat is fun (allows for a great deal of flexibility and playstyles). The visual sets are AMAZING! So many varied landscapes and scenery to explore. Sound quality is great. 

it's a AAA experience for the price of am indie game. In fact, you'll probably get more out of this!

CONS:
Always connected. There are times that playing will be hindered due to connectivity problems. (But not a dealbreaker for me.) 

Others:
SOME people complain about there NOT being an english dub. But I think the chinese audio is great as it is. It adds to the immersion. And the menu and dialogue are all subtitled. Sure there are a few mistakes, but nothing major.

Before anything else, I’ll address some commonly heard concerns:
- When first starting the game, it can be difficult to find the English language setting if you can’t read the Chinese text. Here’s a very simple guide for that: first, select the 5th option (游戏设置), then the 4th tab (偏好), then scroll all the way down to the last option (简体中文) and switch it to the 3rd option (English).
- There’s been a lot of talk about server instability. I believe that this was a problem when the game first came to the west and it seems to have been fixed now. As long as you have a generally stable Internet connection, you should be fine, and during all my time playing I never had any issues with this.

Some more in-depth thoughts below. Spoiler-free besides minor mentions of gameplay aspects. If you prefer to go in completely blind, here’s my full recommendation. If you’re still too unsure if you would enjoy this game, feel free to keep reading.


General:
- This is a single-player experience with no DLC or microtransactions. Knowledge of the previous games in the series is not needed.
- The game is not open-world but rather consists of a large amount of self-contained maps between which you teleport.
- There are a lot of cutscenes in this game. If you should ever feel the need to skip them, you can do that and read brief summaries of what happened in the menu.
- I recommend playing with a controller. Some of the default mappings felt unintuitive to me, but they can be remapped.

Positive:
- A ton of content. My first playthrough took me 80 hours and it still felt like I missed half the game.
- In terms of movement and combat, gameplay feels natural, smooth and responsive.
- Combat is varied and challenging, though difficulty fluctuates in surprising ways throughout the game which is an aspect I really liked. You have the ability to use light and heavy attacks, block and deflect/parry as well as unlock a lot of different special moves via skill trees.
- Boss fights feel appropriately difficult and often require you to take some time to learn the boss’s moveset.
- I encountered no bugs besides two minor visual hiccups throughout all my time playing.
- The optional micromanagement systems and minigames are fun and engaging. If you like fishing, farming, decorating, cooking, card games, monopoly and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, this is the game that will combine all your passions.
- Visually interesting and varied. Although the environments are somewhat hit or miss, none of them were outright bad or didn’t at least have some minor unique twists. There’s also a lot of variety in location layout and level design, though it tends to lean mostly towards corridors and narrow walkways.
- Intricate textures (especially on character models) and dynamic lighting with RTX support that is well integrated into each environment, though obviously results will depend on your system’s capabilities.
- Refreshing perspective shifts to several different characters, all of which control in slightly different ways.
- Menus provide as much information as you could ask for. This game knows that you can’t remember all of its lore and supplies you with a handy encyclopedia recounting all story beats, locations, characters, enemies and more.
- A post-game challenge mode that lets you rematch with some of the game’s bosses.
- I really like the OST. Most tracks feature traditional Chinese instruments and musical conventions which definitely sets it apart from non-Chinese video game OSTs. On a related note, the sound design in this game is great as well.
- The game is very generous in terms of saves. It frequently autosaves and keeps backups of your progress organized by story beats, so if you should ever feel the need to go back to a certain point, you can.
- HUD can be turned off. It sometimes even switches to auto-hide when out of combat, but the exact way to trigger this is still a mystery to me.

Negative:
- The first section (~80 minutes) of the game did not make a good first impression on me. It was only when the game unveiled its full scope and focus that I really started to like it.
-  The plot line only really made sense to me on my second playthrough. If you’re bad at remembering names and connecting things in your head, you’ll probably suffer from the same confusion.
- Some characters seem to lose their personality over time.
- Character animations tend to look stiff in cutscenes.
- The UI design looks a little ugly.
- While the English translation is generally good, there are a few instances where the game doesn’t properly communicate the objective you’re supposed to complete and it might require a bit of guessing and double checking. There are also some grammar mistakes sprinkled throughout the translation.


Conclusion:

Depending on your tastes, Gujian 3 may or may not hit the right spots for you, but speaking from my own experience, I absolutely loved my time with it and if you’re even just a little bit intrigued, I can only highly recommend it.",1588834875,1588834875,True,42,0,0.810160458087921143,0,True,False,False

Combat is absolutelly amazing and along with beautiful graphics it is the shiniest part of the game. Boss fights are awesome and remind of The Witcher III. 
Protagonist is well made, a sombre, lonesome, strongly individual demigod who rejects his divine throne for a simple life in mortal realm, a cool idea. There are also a few other nicely thought characrers, but...
The story is quite interesting, but it is told in a terrible way, full of preaching with characters jumping to conclusions almost all the time about what is right and what is wrong and that kills the feeling completely and can be quite annoying at times, especially with translation that is pretty literal and fails to give the atmosphere of the ancient times. Ancient chinese and taoistic lore is showering all the time randomly and takes the focus from story to teaching Chinese culture quite forcefully. I live in China and like it's culture, but when told this way i tend to get bored.
Story-wise this game plays itself with you running thru fights to connect quite long and slow cutscenes. 
Game stands for an open world, but it is actually 100% linear. Along the linear journey you will gather loads of materials which i never found a way to spend. Trading system exists but it is quite useless so i stopped gathering money completely after some time.
I must add that i really forced myself to play Gujian (which i think shoulld translate as ancient sword), but after 13 hours i surrendered.
The game is quite cheap and if you don't have an ARPG to play, like chinese culture and good combat maybe it is not a mistake to get Gujian 3.",1588669922,1588669922,True,2,1,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
+Beautiful Graphics
+Intriguing Story ( Fey, Spirit Realm, Dream Realm, Mortal Realm, etc)
+Good Character development
+Combat System (very reminiscent of Tales of Berseria without the needing to transition to a separate battle field)
+The English subtitle translation is quite good (few errors here and there but this is not a Engrish level bad translation so it makes the story cutscenes and party banter easy to follow really well done!)
+Music fits the Chinese backdrop setting very well (voice acting is not bad at all but nothing stands out either performance wise)
-Extensive crafting system

Cons:
-DRM (i generally avoid DRM games and I know for some it is a big issue)
-Character animations can be a little stiff at times
-Occasional texture pop-in when they do big area pan through with the camera (dont really notice it on actual play in said areas)
- One character that some people may find kind of annoying
-Small cast of characters (4 total)

So first a few caveats about my 73 hours into this game. I played this entirely on Linux (SailentOS Arch based Distro) through Proton. Performance was similar as on Windows. This is a Linux/Proton specific issue, sometimes the shadows ( maybe a half dozen or so times in my entire 73 hour play through) dont render right so character models lack color (ie are totally gray) but that is the only issue I encountered.

TLDR: This is what FFXV should have been! (I like XV but I am not oblivious to its many flaws)",1587965571,1587965797,True,5,0,0.504792332649230957,0,True,False,False

Would you like new land exploration and beautiful sight-seeing places you had traveled?
Would you like pretty girls and have them party on your journey?
Would you like bounty and treasure hunter? Every single item was worth to pick up when you found it.
Would you like something challenge?
Would you like a place you build and develop and earn profits?

Game was story-telling. It's not fun if you understand nothing while you're playing. Listen their stories and you will find out what to do. At the normal beginning, game is little difficult. It becomes easier until you reached a certain progress but it's still challenge. Final act was short, quickly go to the end.

Game supports English, 4K, both game-pad and keyboard+mouse good to go.

It's... okay, bordering on mediocre.

TLDR
- Lackluster story presentation and pacing
- Tedious, monotonous combat (I strongly recommend playing on Easy difficulty so you can get through the combat as quickly as possible)
- Serviceable, dry English localization
- Game doesn't give you that much of a reason to care, to continue following the story. They don't really get you invested in the characters.",1587186693,1587186693,False,0,0,0.473455190658569336,0,True,False,False

Before you buy it, you should know this game is heavily story-driven and exploration-based. If you are a gamer that like exploration, collecting rewards, and/or storytelling, you are in for a treat! 

This single-player game does require internet connection to run. This very inconvenient function might have something to do with IP protection during its initial release in China to prevent pirated copies. Unfortunately, the IP protection was carried over to the Steam version, likely because the developer wasn't planning to release the game in English during its initial release in 2018.

The length of this game can greatly vary depending on whether the player choose to complete side quests, and how often you take part in the crafting and home-renovation system.

[b]Story[/b] 
The story of Gujian 3 is a stand-alone story. Although there are a few links to the previous installments, these links are basically Easter eggs and fan service, and you don't need prior knowledge of the franchise to get a good understanding of the story.

The most interesting about Gujian 3's storytelling is that a lot of details were told in an indirect, ambiguous way, such as a character's shadow during the cinematic can reveal important plot information. Furthermore, a portion of the main story is tied into the side quests. Depending on whether certain quests are triggered or completed, they can cause minor changes to the story, help expanding the story, or alter certain character's fate.

[b]Quest system:[/b]
The quest system in this game is quite complex but confusing. Overall, there are four types of quest: main plot, story-driven side quests, area quests, and quest-board quests, and these four types can sometimes intertwine. Most quests are timed since they are linked to the progression of the main story, and it is handy that most quests are shown on the map. Some functions such as the crafting and recruitment systems are closely tied to the side quests. 

What is confusing is that while many quests are linked, the in-game quest system does not specify how they are connected, therefore, it can be disoriented to figure out whether some longer quests were fully completed or not. I think some improved UI design can fix this problem in future installment. There are also poems and diaries that can be found throughout the world, but they don't show up in the collection of documents or being recorded in anyway, which can also be quite confusing during the first play through.

[b]Gameplay & Systems - Battle, Home renovation, Crafting and Farming, Recruitment system[/b]
I think gameplay is the biggest highlight of the game. I like how the battle system, crafting, home-renovation, etc. are all connected.

Battle -  A lot of crafting resources are mainly attained from enemies, which makes random battle encounters less boring, especially when the characters stop receiving EXP at high levels. Since most maps are very wide, the player can often simply run past the enemies to avoid battles. In terms of character skills, the game only allows you to fully control the protagonist, Beiluo (北洛), while all other 3 ""playable"" characters are controlled via AI. These three characters do have their own skill trees, and you can customize how they should battle and what skill they should use to assist Beiluo.

Crafting - Most of the crafting outcomes such as weapon appearance, adornments, and ""decorative"" outfits (not to be confused with armours) can be visibly shown on the characters and change how the characters look. The game even has a placement customization system which allow the player to adjust the location and size of the adornments. However, this system is a bit buggy, because many items don't have collision attribute, they often penetrate the character models.

Recruitment - If you enjoy collecting,the recruitment system is actually very fun and satisfying. You can recruit artisans by completing quests, or make certain enemies into your allies. They will either help out in your home, or give you additional battle skills to diversify your battle strategy. One detail I like is how some NPCs look very ordinary when I simply ran past them at first. As the story progresses, they turn out to be recruitable allies that have their own story lines.

Home renovation - after unlocking the home, you can renovate the home by crafting or collecting furniture, plants, houses, and etc. Some architecture have actual function, while others are purely cosmetic. You can also farm, mine, fish, and send your monster allies to explore previously visited maps and they will gather resources for you. The farming and mining are simply a one-click thing, but they are  linked to a more interactive crafting/research components or the game.

[b]Graphics & Music[/b]
Graphic, art direction, and music work together to create the beautiful atmospheres in the game.  The in-game world is very beautiful, and if your computer can run it smoothly, it is quite eye catching. There are only a few town-styled map in the game, but they are all very unique. I do find some of the cave-styled maps boring because they are too large and take a very long time to explore, but overall, I do appreciate there are always some visual elements at each location that make them memorable. Last, music is beautifully crafted as usual, especially the end-credit score provides an atmospheric wrap to the game. 

[b]Some cons[/b]
-  I think the cons are mainly relating to user experience and UI design. Some UI element can be a bit confusing such as the in-game quest system as I mentioned before. Furthermore, I think there can bit a few more teleportation point on some of the larger maps, as running and jumping around these maps are very time consuming and can feel really redundant. 
- During the main story, there are several segments that force the player to run or walk down a long path, while there weren't enough dialogues or plot elements to cover the entire trip, so these trips can feel very boring. 
- Also, there are some graphic glitches from time to time, apparently caused by the outdated Vision Engine. I don't find the bug too distracting or game breaking, but it is up to each person's preference. 

[u]I would give this game an 86/100. Even though Chinese game developer is still in the development stage in comparison to the US and Japanese game developers, and such difference is still present in Gujian 3, but this game is a solid, promising entry and a sincerely made, fun game,  and it does not disappoint.[/u]

Update 2020.04: since I am doing my second run in English, I've made some revisions and additions:
1. The English translation is surprisingly good, although not perfect. Since the Chinese version contains many literary phrases and ancient texts, I find the story is actually easier to understand in English because the English version is more descriptive, despite of some minor translation and proofreading errors. Overall, the translation does capture the overall atmosphere of the original Chinese version, although I do find some details and word choices being too complicated in the English context.
2. The game is more fun on the 2nd walkthrough, because there are a lot of details that are easily missed on the first-run, even if you already know the main story. I now realize some of the scattered notes and NPC dialogues found in game contain dramatic, secret story lines. 
3. The recommended normal battle difficulty is actually quite easy for those folks that are familiar with ARPG games, and it can feel boring as the player levels up, so I recommend starting the game on hard or expert (challenge) mode. I find the battle way more fun after playing on Expert. It is challenging but beatable, and requires more strategic thinking and unleashes the true potential of the characters' skill tree.",1577345884,1587044305,True,52,2,0.810845792293548584,9,True,False,False

Gameplay is really intresting, action packed, but it does feel kinda janky at times in movement, especially on jumping sections.  There are huge plains to explore and they look nice, vibrant, colorful, but also they do at times feel completely empty. Story seems intresting so far, but also forcefully convoluted (this I will blame on the fact that it's third game of the series and series itself is part of larger universe which is considered quite popular in China and I have zero knowlage about it). Music and sound is OK, but it doesn't offer much of variety. It sometimes feels like a bit more polish here and there would make it a great title.

It's wreid specimen... Maybe just the start is like this and I will change my mind when I spend some more time playing the game.

Better than I expected. Honestly did not expect a lot since I've had bad experiences with Chinese games but decided to try this one since the reviews were good and the screenshots looked nice. I have not been disappointed in the least bit and was actually surprised at the quality. Especially the environments, holy shit they look even better in game.

At 25 hours in the game is still pretty linear in terms of progression but it seems things are starting to open up a bit more. According to hltb I'm a little over half way through. The maps do have room to explore and there are a variety of sub-quests but to be honest I feel like they are just tacked on. I don't feel like anything is missed by skipping the side-content. Luckily the gameplay is fun and the world looks beautiful so I definitely do not mind the kill quests now and then. The others are boring. Fetch quests, fishing quests.. boring, but it's there.

The story reminds me of the better side of older JRPG/anime's in the way it progresses. Good characters, no whiny MC. MC has a strong power that he doesn't want to use but is forced to. That sort of thing. Story has a lot of references to Chinese legends/history which I'm not too familiar with so it's a bit refreshing compared to what I'm used to. Easy to follow for the most part other than the names.

+There really wasn't any need for base building, clothing crafting, cooking, fishing, farming, card games etc etc in the game, but it's an extra thing for the people that enjoy doing that. It's like somebody higher up really wanted an island where they had the option to gather everything without leaving, ever and they just had to implement it. It's also completely optional aside from the tutorial quests.
+Gameplay is nice, combat is decently challenging on higher difficulty. Although it is mostly hack and slash with a lot of dashes/blocks in between, there is a good amount of customisable skills and support items to create your own style of fighting.
+ Also, pausable cutscenes

- The only bad thing for me personally (gameplay wise) is that the maps are HUGE. Expect like an hour or two (perhaps more) to get through a map, partially because of all the cutscenes. The fact that the maps are huge wouldn't necessarily be bad, but they are empty for over 50-60% of that space so it's just extra pointless running really.

--- The really bad thing, and why i can't recommend it currently, is the always online requirement, for an offline, single player game. I played for about 30 hours of this game spread over the last two weeks without issues. Then yesterday they must have messed up something with the servers because people can no longer play, let alone start up the game because it requires you to be connected to the server.

1. Nier and Nier Automata
2. Most Ys games
3. Most Tales and Kiseki games
4. Action games like Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, and God of War games
5. Dragon Age, Kingdoms of Amalur, Elder Scrolls, Witcher 3, etc.
So now you have an idea of what I like: JRPGs, WRPGs, Action RPGs, Action games, Open world RPGS, usually reflex-skill fast paced. Games that have a stamina meter, skill trees, party members, story driven, good characters, romance, and most of all, GOOD, fluid gameplay. I also plan to get Trials of Mana, Tales of Arise, and others in the future. 

So now you have an idea of what I like. Well, if your tastes are anything like mine, or close to similar to mine, then you will really like this game. Let's get into details: 


Combat: 9/10 
(basically Nier Automata is my 10/10 so...)
Fast paced combat, skill trees, crafting, levelling, and basically EVERY button on your controller does a different action during combat. You can even get creatures to make pacts with you and get new skills for them to help you in combat as well. So you have your skills, party members skills, pact skills, rift skills, and a TON of variety to choose from, combat-style wise.

Graphics: 10/10
Gorgeous. Enough said. 

Performance: 2/10
Basically....it sucks. I can run it at a clean 60 fps no issues until you get to the hour of gameplay. Here I have to reset my computer every time because this game is NOT optimized for long gameplay sessions and suffers serious memory leaks. So it took me 50 hours to beat...so I reset close to that amount of times. However, when it is fluid...it is GOOD. Lots of microstuttering as well. Annoying as hell. And my PC is POWERFUL. 
EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE is the fact that EVEN WITH THIS......I kept playing. Usually when a game has performance issues I drop it. But this one....I wanted to know what happened baby. It had me hooked. So I just got used to it. 

Translation: 4/10
Dialogue between characters is good. Story is good. Cutscenes it's good (minus some gramatical errors). But the menus.....THE MENUS. You basically have to figure which hot key corresponds to what. Sometimes one command in one menu is called a Heal Skill, but in another it's a Support Skill, and in another it's a Control Skill. AND THEY ARE THE SAME THING. Jesus. Once you figure it out though, your controller let's you do ANYTHING during combat. You have so many skills mapped to your controller and everything just FLOWS and you end up doing amazing combos between your skills, your team skills, your creature pact skills, get insane dmg multipliers and it feels SATISFYING. But the translations??? Damn. Is it obvious that I like the combat btw?

Story: 7/10
Good story. Not amazing. But the characters kept it going. I basically wanted to know the fate of my favorite couple...and I kinda got it. Kind of...because it also sets up another game that hasn't been developed yet. So there are some loose ends. But they at least told me pretty clearly who does who and who ends up with who.

Characters: 8/10
At first the main character annoyed me, but he grows A LOT during the game. Same with his main girl. Ended up really liking both. Side characters and other party members are pretty cool as well. Since there are so many species (mortals, haunts, feys, etc) you get a party member from each faction to see their point of view of the situation. So it was all good.

Soundtrack: 9/10
Beautiful. Not much to say

Overall: 7/10
GREAT, varied, FAST combat. Party based combat. Just up my alley. Good characters. Good story. (Notice the use of ""good"", not ""great""). GREAT graphics. HORRIBLE performance that you need to get used to... Annoying menu translation. But still, for any one looking basically for a good looking 3D expansive Ys game, this is the game for you. 

Totally recommended!!!! Still wondering why I never heard of it before :)",1585523888,1585523888,True,68,2,0.851941943168640137,1,True,False,False

Boy I'm glad I was wrong.

Pros:
-Excellent combat 
-Lots of mini-games and micro management to keep you interested
-Awesome graphics
-Setting is ancient China inspired. What other triple-A single player games gives you that?
-Best in-game mascot (personal opinion)

Cons:
-Story telling is a bit all over the place. Some important plot points have not been established with enough background.
-The Chinese names of places and names may be hard to follow if you're not used to Chinese themed media.
-The game does not tell you about some mechanics like you can upgrade a skill more than once for an added effect or crafting and research both give experience.
-Always online DRM. I f*cking hate when a game has this.

Overall, I'm pleased with this game. I just beat it doing most of the side quests. I only have the lotuscape and Persimmon adventures game pending. Haven't finished challenge mode as well.

语音也可以说是在声音表达上非常生动，当然这也可能只是针对中国人。毕竟有些中国诗句，谚语之类的对外国的玩家来说可能也一时半会不明白什么意思。

良心来说可能也要英语配音？毕竟看了外国的实况主玩的时候有些字幕翻译确实是令人费解，这一点官方也是可以慢慢改善。有种就是直接谷歌翻译出来的感觉吧。

整体某种程度上来说就是无可挑剔。

well for I was heard for some produce information, it just make it in a limit time and limit conditions.
Well but at looking all of the results , it was very satisfy and enjoying in fighting and looking at the story. The places and maps are very beautiful like you can't believe someone actually make it.

But the only things about characters that was a little bit disappointed is just the emotional appearance is a little bit like hard? just not much realistic as a human. But they make it good like the Yun'wuyue and Beiluo are some cold personalities , so not much changes in faces is acceptable for myself.

well but some chinese unique sentence or poem huh , is not that much clear that Other countries people know like non-chinese people. It might said that producer needs the english voice added on this game.

And the subtitles is just like the chinese sentence directly copy and paste to Google translate and move back into the game. So some chinese word in English is just looks absolutely weird. This producer can just slowly improve.

WELL but anyway , this story, maps , the freedom in this game is just fun enjoyable and LITERALLY BEST.

You’ll want to play this game in a fairly condensed time in order to follow the story arc, and you want to do the side quests to complete the story if the story is why you’re playing.

If you don’t care about the story and just the combat you’re getting into a standard hack and slash game where blocking, dodging and attacking are the main draws, and it performs up to standard in this regard. Enemies are as diverse as a game like Devil May Cry, which should mean that they are all about the same as far as attack types and danger levels. Expect to get bored with anything that is not a boss fight, and by the end even that is on repeat. You’ll see the same environments several times as well. Lots and lots of running to nowhere.

You will need to grind parts of this game on boring mobs and farming sword shards, no matter what. If you kill every mob you see you do not need to go out of your way to farm, but the repetitive nature of the combat is farming in and of itself. Diversity of combat situations is not a strong suit of this game, but rather it thrives on immersive story telling and 3d world building.

You can buy decent armor in Yangping and never need to engage in Lotuscape and its myriad minigames. I’m not sure why it is there other than as a fun diversion for hard core fans and grabbing some very baseline health. For all my efforts to care I just could not get into it. You need only farm sword shards, upgrade both your own and the team’s weapons to level 12 and you’re good to go on finishing the main quest. I grabbed about 10 potions out of Lotuscape in my play through and it was enough to beat it without issue.

This game is awesome if you’re into Chinese culture, stories, and myths and its a cool way to live out all those fantasies you’ve had about high, cloud touched peaks as well as the lush pavilions that line karst-peaked cities. This game will largely transport you to a version of Mainland China you can visit if you’d like to without all the crowds or touts. For what its worth a visit in real life is well worth it but this game will serve as a reasonable second.

The major plus about this game as well as its drawback is the rich world you will find yourself in. On the one hand it is visually impressive, begging you to take screen shots as your next PC background at every turn. On the other it is a world where items and details are lost in the massive size of every map you encounter. You’ll spam the pulse button to see what collectibles are around and the little ping noise it makes will grate your soul to shreds. Saying this game is a running simulator with a repetitive combat sim on top of it is not far off the mark, and it spaces those two aspects out with a lot of 3D style story telling. There is no balance between cut scenes and combat with chunks of hours dedicated to each to the exclusion of the other. If you love a great Mandarin-language court intrigue drama however, this game is for you.

About playtime and the final boss, mild spoilers in this paragraph please skip below if you want to avoid that. 

It took me 37 hours to beat the game watching all cinematic bits, and in my experience you must be level 58 with a level 12 sword to finish the game. At level 57 with a level 11 sword I could not finish the final stage of the boss fight. It may be a glitch but the boss regenerated his health at level 57 so I could not kill it. I tried and tried, wailing away at the darn thing but it would not stop getting back its full health bar. At level 58 the boss would regenerate its life and then it would go back down to where I had it before the regenerative effect. It was odd, but in the end that is what level I was able to beat the boss. The first stage of the boss was notably longer in terms of combat and damage done at level 57 than level 58. This is the same situation with other bosses once you pass the forge-centered missions where you must be at or above the level of the boss in order to easily proceed.

My final review is this game is good if you have time and patience to let something beautiful happen. The undersea palace is one of the best levels in a video game I have ever played, but then the sponge bosses in the late game not only ruin the experience but make your journey seem pointless. You’ll need to kill every mob you see, which is not only dull but ruins the joy of the game, and Lotuscape is useless   to the main story. The game you think you’re playing in hours 1 – 20 and 20 – 40 are almost entirely disconnected and there is no reason to want to back track into those “lush” environments that were created. They are momentary eye candy at best and quickly lose their appeal as the other flaws of the game become apparent.

With that said this game is a seriously positive step in the mainland Chinese game market, a continuation of a wildly popular series and a welcome addition to the realm of not only hack and slash games but RPGs in general. This is more a building block to an epic game in the future than an ends in and of itself, but you wont regret paying the deep-sale price on steam for a 40 hour play. Just remember that it is NOT a perfect game, there are tons of translation errors, you need to farm to win and any time you reach an area marked ???? you need to be 3 levels above the first mob you meet. If you do that, and if you give this game a chance to develop you will be rewarded. Are you the kind of player who needs a quick fix, or are you the kind of person who loves to see a flower sprout and bloom to its full potential. If you’re that kind of patient gamer, drop the hammer on this title and reward yourself with a world you didn’t know you needed until now.",1584465658,1584465684,True,83,2,0.877368688583374023,0,True,False,False

The translation could be better, and some of the game mechanics could be more polished and allow you more freedom (we are constantly hearing that our character is powerful, but it only seems that way in cutscenes). Talking about cutscenes... THERE IS TOO MANY OF THEM. Like, seriously, sometimes you leave a cutscene to just end up in a new cutscene after two or three steps. And that can happen several times in a row. I get the point that the story needs to be told, but there are other ways to do so.

Let me start off with the positives :
+ You are getting many hours of fun for a price point that is this low. 
+ The world is extremely beautiful. Sometimes I would just walk around the towns or stare at the scenery to soak it all in.
+ The gameplay is really enjoyable. Not too grindy and with the right balance of fighting, quests and side activities
+ Lots of side scenarios to encounter and explore
+ Most of the quests made sense (except some). The character doesn't get ordered to go do this and that just for the heck of it. Also, the quests aren't tedious.
+ It was obvious that the devs put a lot of love and care into the game. Many aspects of the gameplay were very intricate and detailed

Some of the mediocre things :
~ Not sure if parts of the story got lost in translation but at times it felt like the same few points were being hammered over and over again and parts of it got confusing.
~ The final few acts were not as engaging. The final fight and scenes were quite bland and felt like they ended without much consequences. It wasn't bad per say, but just meh.
~ The characters aren't unlikeable but it was difficult to get attached to them.

Now some negatives :
- Voice acting is very monotone with barely any emotions and because of that, it was difficult to get engaged with the characters.
- Characters barely react to shocking events. They barely react strongly about anything at all. Everyone just seems like they're going through the motions.
- Even some important side characters who are a part of the main quest have the same models or facial presets as the NPCs. 
- There were few types of monsters and most were just recolours of each other. Even mini-bosses were sometimes repeated.
- Some of the side plots weren't resolved by the end of the game and some important side characters get completely forgotten halfway through. Even around the fourth act, one of the main cast members barely show up or have any dialog and doesn't even show up at all for the ending.


Despite the negatives, I really do highly recommend this game. Most of the things that bothered me are about the directing rather than the gameplay itself. Especially at this price point, I shouldn't be surprised if the studio had little money for its development and even then, they did a great job. It is a fun experience through and through. I'm looking forward to more games by this studio and hope that they release them in English as well.

1.  Game is single player but is online only.  There is no local save file and only the cloud saves.  There is the possibility that your internet will cut in game and prevent you from saving your progress.  Most of the negative reviews to the game are because of this always online feature.  I have not had any issues so far with losing saves or progress due to this.  Others have and to who is at fault, I can not say.  Buyer Beware!

2.  I am only part way through the game, but have sufficiently played enough to make an initial judgement on whether my $10(sale price) was well spent.  Even at full price, its a pretty decent value.  I will add more later.

3.  What is Gujian3 and what is it compared to?  Witcher?  Final Fantasy?  Is this really Jade Empire2?  Is it a deep Actrion RPG?  Is it huge open world to explore?

Answer is pretty much no to everything.  It is its own thing.  I would best describe it as Action/Adventure meets Visual Novel.

跳出这个语境来说，老生常谈的相比国外的制作还有很长的路要走。
令我个人最不能满意的就是这个故事：
其实故事内核简单的要死：有个上古坏蛋复活了要毁灭世界，主角一行人拯救世界。很多故事也都是这个内核。没啥问题
    可问题在于这个故事讲得太让人疲惫了，充满了为了显得丰满而加进去，毫无必要的设定和世界观补充，还要角色硬要讲给你听，“你听我们这个多合理，多自圆其说”，甚至有种上古剑奇谭课的感觉。游戏后期经常在一句话里出现好几个人名，地名，法术名，仙术名，魔物名，兵器名。。而且直到最后的最后都层出不穷。有的人物出场就一个画面几句台词，在这种情况下，几条时间线的故事破碎的传插期间，人物的塑造全靠后期开了“上帝视角”学了心理分析的“主角”说。真的，抛开故事本身的质量，这个故事首先就没有讲好。
    在此基础上，有的反直觉，让人不禁想问”他怎么做到的？”得桥段依旧存在，并且被糊弄过去了。游戏后期最后一个可以参与战斗的角色，他是穿梭位面的？北洛是如何在精神位面以及好几个物质位面里来回跳跃的，如果不是一直在给填鸭设定，我可能会忽略，可一方面疯狂填鸭，一方面又只口不谈。。。拧巴。
    最后，结局太令人意犹未尽了，这就完了？？
    故事之外的部分，家园系统开放之后，就通货膨胀了，我个人不以在一个RPG里造房子里为乐趣所以就单纯的是个资源来源。所有支线和侠义榜都是延长游戏时间的尝试，但是对主线和世界观铺陈毫无帮助，消磨了我的游戏热情。
    综上：就国产游戏来说，非常值得一试。跳出国产游戏的语境，还差得远。

The story and in-game world portrays elements from Chinese culture and mythology beautifully. 
However, with a story and in-game world such deeply rooted in Chinese culture and mythology, it is almost impossible to convey the great story to Western audience. 

Western gamers should also be aware of the challenging environment facing Chinese PC game developers. With dominance of mobile games and online games, there is very little market left for traditional PC games in China.  Thus, investing in such a large project is very risky and may not financially rewarding. It takes the developer and publisher team great dedication and devotion.

It was so good that I was simply taken back by all the amazing things this game had. Many compare to it to witcher 3 - I wouldn't. It's quite different in many aspects and the storyline is very lineral. But the story line is amazing. And the greatness itself with everything I have in there is comparable.

There are already many great reviews that describe well this game, together with cons and pros. I just want to say few things that were most yaw-dropping.

* Visuals and design is just stunning. There were too many moments when I had to stop and just enjoy the view. Not many games are as beautiful as this game.
* Combat has many layers and I can choose how I fight, while keeping it simple. I really enjoyed combat, including boss fights, making my own style and skills I liked to use.
* The characters were truly enjoyable. All of them. There were few moments where I couldn't help but fight against onion ninjas.
* There's a lot of extra you can do and spend time on. If you don't want to do that, you don't have to either.

Perhaps only bad point I really want to point out is DRM related issue. There are 2 servers, NA and chinese. When you start game, go to america (if you don't live in china). The great firewall of china is doing it's work and the saving will get super frustrating. Even if you're like lots of hours in, just redo it and skip all the cutscenes. You'll thank me later. I had zero issues in NA server. Which brings to the main point.

If you don't have active internet connection, you can't really play it. It requires you to stay always online and it saves all the save files to their server. This might frustrating to many, especially if you have poor internet. But the main reason for that is this is in the end Chinese game where pirating is a huge issue. While I understand frustration, try to understand their culture and their reasoning. If you bought the game, use NA servers and have okay connection, there's nothing to worry about.

Conclusion, I loved it, I consider it now one of my all-time favourites and I really hope that there's Gujian 4, translated to English.

I'm pleased to say that there was no barrier to thoroughly enjoying this game, despite knowing zero Chinese.  In fact, this experience leads me to suspect there is a treasure trove of Chinese RPGs that the Western world would love to experience.  More translations please!

The translation related to in game systems (tutorials, quests, menus, mini-games, etc.) is great.  The translation for dialogue is not so great.  Even so, the lore, world and characters shine through.  The game is steeped in atmosphere and is dramatic in a near theatrical, often poetic way.  My main gripe with the translation is I find the heart of the dialogue so lovey that I surmise if I did know Chinese, or if it had a better translation, it would be an even richer experience.

Nonetheless, the experience is rich.  Some gameplay aspects roll out just a bit slowly, so it feels sort of dry at first (like most RPGs), but from there it dolls out a steady pace of increasing breadth in combat, side-quests, farming, fishing, fun in-game card game, many mini-games and other RPG staples.

The story itself is also quite interesting, though it takes a bit of time to figure some things out, since there isn't a lot of support for English speakers around. Posting an English question in discussions will sometimes get you the answers you need, though google isn't all that helpful in that regard. 

You can use the 'search' bar to find a specific question you need answered before adding another discussion about it though. Sometimes people have already asked, other times it's a question others want answered too, so everyone wins once someone helps you there.

English speakers should also select the 'North America Server' though, not the Chinese one, or you won't understand anything in the game. So be aware of that. It's that little window that pops up when you start the game.

I haven't had many problems with it running well and bugs are minimum which is a huge plus compared with a lot of the 'big games' nowadays. It has a lot of cut-scenes since it is story driven and some of the translations are a little 'funny' but you can usually figure what they mean with relative ease.

While playing through the story, it is a good idea to do as many side quests as possible, as they unlock things for 'Lotus Scape' which you will have access to fairly early in game. I generally check the notice boards in between story missions to try and make sure I don't miss anything. Though sometimes you still might miss a few things, but you can do a sort of 'New Game +' with a few things transferred in between games. Sadly, some things for 'Lotus Scape' and the like will disappear.

It's also a good idea to always check your map carefully in cities, as side quests can randomly appear at times. This includes the city you start in at the beginning of the game. Teleporting between these places also  becomes available as you go through the story a little, but it's pretty easy to figure out.

- On a mix of low/medium settings, I cannot hold 60 fps in many areas of the game, notably the first city you come to within the first hour of the game. While the city is pretty, many older games are more graphically demanding and yet run faster/smoother. Even the original Crysis maxed out runs better than this game on my rig... and it's not optimized for modern hardware configurations at all.

- The pop-in. Oh my god. It's worse than Arma 3. It makes vanilla Witcher 3 and Skyrim LOD look like technological masterpieces. Large swaths of grass/foliage around you will change their LOD ten feet away, five feet away, and also as you're walking through them. NPCs pop in and out constantly, reminding me of various demanding games on the Nintendo Switch (e.g. Xenoblade Chronicles 2). When anything pops in, it's incredibly distracting from anything else on the screen.

The gameplay is fun, though, I'll give it that. I would wait for a steep sale, because there is a great game here. The tech issues just make it less fun and borderline unplayable for me.",1582244367,1582244367,False,0,0,0.483346879482269287,3,True,False,False

Heroes have godly powers in cutscenes, but are terrible during gameplay.
Non-lethal wounds kills people during cutscenes, but you brush off lethal wounds in every fight.
Search 10 square miles for collectibles = find 1 healing herb (areas way too big or characters run way too slow).
If you meet a new character for the first time, they are probably long-time friends of the hero with a significant past that you have never heard of before now.
Dialog contains tons of references to character names you have never heard of and cannot distinguish between.
Searching everywhere for secrets and finally finding one? It is a weak healing herb.

'Cause I've played two other Chinese rpgs, you will find some comparisons here and there between the three games. Overall the mainstory is very interesting but the one of Gujian 3 was not as quite as good as the story of Chinese Paladin 6. At some points I'd expected some more twists but do not get me wrong, the story of Gujian 3 is nevertheless way better than most of the western games nowadays (one exception is maybe Red Dead Redemption 2). The graphics are beautiful sometimes even stunning. The music is great and often creates a traditional atmosphere, especially in the villages/towns. The combat system is decent (in my opinion better than Gate of Firmament but I liked the round based system of Chinese Paladin 6 the most). I didn't experience any problems with server connectivity (played on northern American servers, Game is ""always on"" due to piracy protection I guess). Also I couldn't find huge technical issues like bugs or bigger frame drops (I use a RTX 2060, it serves the game well). 

The game has a great lore section where you can get tons of background informations. I liked that very much. The translation is very good compared to Gate of Firmament and Chinese Paladin 6 (although both of these games are overall very good understandable). I only realized some minor mistranslations (like ""has"" instead of ""have"" or the wrong use of plural and singular). The sidequests often are repetetive but because of the beautiful atmosphere the game creates I enjoyed them nonetheless. There is also a crafting system but I did not finish all possible recipes because most of them are not needed for enhancing the characters. Especially in the early stages of the game the crafting is quite exhausting in means of consumption of material and stamina of your staff. It was a nice idea though  installing the Lotuscape as a retreat and for farming some needed materials, plants and fish.

The card game is very nice. I think after playing a few rounds the basics are quite understandable even without further explanations. 

One thing in particular I find somewhat negative. The characters have nice stories (esp. Bei Luo and Yun'wuyue) but I felt that the developers didn't gave them enough time to develop. Also the relationship between the four main characters didn't get enough space to unfold. At some time you can feel that they have a relationship and care for each other but there is something missing. The player cannot observe enough to get a connection to these four (Gate of Firmament and Chinese Paladin 6 got that way better so that you even feel some kind of attachment to the characters and understand the kind of relationships between them). The characters of Gujian 3 somehow remain a little bit distant. Only Bei Luo can be controlled (battle and exploration), the other three have a skill for battle which you can trigger by pressing the corresponding button but that's all. Apart from that they are controlled by AI. Also you can not use one of the other characters for exploring the world (both, Gate of Firmament and Chinese Paladin 6 give you the option to use all different characters during exploration or battle, I like that way more) and Yun'wuyue has very rare appearances while exploring. This is also a reason for a lack of connection to this character.

Overall for about 25 € it was not a failed purchase. If you like and enjoy chinese atmosphere, a great and a bit different story (compared to western games), beautiful graphics and music and are willing to spend a lot of time (I guess the main story alone will consume at least 40hrs) than I highly recommend buying it. 

I wish for the first and second installment to get english translation but I do not think we will see that soon (maybe the fan project of part 1 will finish it somewhere in the near future...and the devs/publisher hopefully won't prohibit it).",1578268374,1582063022,True,78,5,0.8623390793800354,8,True,False,False

But the combat feels very responsive and has pretty standard mechanics attached, with skills attached to combat based build up. 

\Update: so I think I got a good amount of hours into the game to get a jist of it. 

So the story follows Beilou, who is a shadowchaser inheriting the kingdom of Fey. However the twist is that; he's not some teenager with a mystery background. He is the twin of the current King of Fey Kingdom, he was tossed out and even hunted for being his twin. 

So pretty interesting story; so far the combat is standard action combat with skills you can access via button press, there's a guard button and a dodge button; the number of evasive action taken depends on your ""stamina"" bar.  And light and heavy attacks generate your resources neede to perform special skills; although I find 3 total resources to be a bit lacking and feels like a lazy design decision. 

There are a couple of issues I have so far are game design decisions: they purposely did not mark any of the item you can interact with, you have to find ALL of them through the inspect button; but, the special mark for objects doesn't stay on long. So you constantly have to use it to find objects you can interact with. 

Of course in a dungeon you eventually get the hint on what you can interact with and what you can't But in towns the number of objects and variations of the objects increase by a lot. So they invented the problem and gave you a patchwork solution. I'm sure over my few hours of play I missed a lot of things. 

Second you have these specially sealed treasure chests around the world and dungeon; to unseal them you need sealing paper and those are pricey. 

So are these chest meant to make you retrack? That makes no sense so far, since I'm not sure what the retrack is like. And the treasure quality is mediocre. 

Will update again with more hours of game play.",1581624294,1581718117,True,2,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

Graphics are wonderful, Final Fantasy 15 caliber graphics, but without the input lag. Environments so far have been varied and beautifully colored, from grassy fields to a Chinese village to a dark dream land with floating objects to a vibrant forest. No problem for English speakers like myself, subtitles are translated well and menus are too. Boss fights are interesting and unique each time, each one will have a different pattern of attack so you have to time your sword swings well and dodge at the right time too, in addition to using skills from the 1, 2, 3, and 4 keys. One minor thing is that AI can't jump, and there are some neat platforming components to this game, but your follower just teleports to you once you've completed the platforming; they don't jump along with you. Another complaint is that the game is entirely linear, which makes me think of what it could have been had they added more of an open world.

Despite these issues, the game is mostly fantastic, and I give it a 9/10. Also bought on sale for around $10 which is an awesome deal.",1581392916,1581392916,True,4,0,0.451760411262512207,0,True,False,False

In the style of a flowing chinese fantasy drama you slay demons, investigate mysteries, and try to save a city of fey, and perhaps the whole world, from strange goings-on, all presented in a format that, while not exactly unique, benefits fully from that story style. There is lots to do, from sidequests, a home base building system, and a simple card game. 
In terms of drawbacks, the english translation is a tad odd at times, but entirely readable, making the odd times when the terminology selected seems extra at odds with how it's presented, and the gameplay is prone to long beats of throwing you from dungeon to dungeon without breaks. You NEED to keep searching for items to get anywhere.

Sword Play: Overall very flashy but lacking in substance. On par with the earlier Devil May Cry's, but parry and sword blows don't feel that impactful. Can't use nuke and spells like Geralt. Personally, WEAKER than Witcher 3

It looks cool but this whole jumping thing, along with the walk and stop animation delays is just annoying. Not to mention some of the clusters of enemies is just poor artificial difficulty.

Idk, maybe dark souls has babied me with great enemy design and I feel like the damage sponge approach should always be a no go in video games.. *Cough* MMOs. It just doesn't feel like your character is powerful in any aspect.. I also hate when games give you a powerful character to play as right from the start then take it away.

TLDR: Witcher-like adventure game with DMC-like hack and slash action, and a really well-made story. This is definitely a hidden gem, don't let the Chinese language bar you from this fantastic game. 

The story is really well done. It isn't that original, but still good. I have some gripes about the translation, as it can be hard to keep up with it (there are a lot of typos in the game!!), and it does require some knowledge of Chinese history, but for the most part its well explained and very interesting. Also, I wish the characters were a bit more fleshed out, but it didn't deter from the experience.

Gameplay is FANTASTIC. It's hack and slash, and its very fun, especially the boss fights. It can be challenging at times as well, but nothing like Dark Souls or Sekiro. 

Graphics is beautiful, the worlds are all very creatively made, it really is awesome to look at at times. There are some textures that look off, but for the most part the game looks good. 

Voice acting was good but could have been better. It feels monotonous at times however, I wish there was a bit more emotion. But good overall.

The soundtrack to this game is just beautiful, I don't think I listened to one bad song the entire time.

Bought this game on sale for $10, its prolly the best $10 I've spent.

On top of that the mechanics are fun, the swordplay is brilliant and intuitive, the card game and fishing minigames are good, especially the card game, I wish this was a real card game! 
The writing is great too, as someone who has never seen the other games in the series (as they're in chinese only) it's a great introduction to the world and you don't miss anything as far as I can tell. There are dragon age esque encylopedia for all the characters, places and concepts. All beautifully writing.
And just, Good Lord this game is PRETTY. 
I would sort of describe it as between witcher 3 and final fantasy for genre?
I would 100% recommend it, especially as compared to western and japanese AAA games it is crazy cheap! and worth more than most of them.

As someone who is fluent in Chinese and English,  I noticed there are significant ""reduction"" in translations. Sure, it is free of grammar/spelling errors, but a lot of the spoken Chinese and English don't match.

Imagine this

Spoken words: ""Based the injuries the victim suffered, and evidence that place Mr. Wu in the same room at the night of the murder, I believe he was the killer or know who is the killer""

Translated text ""Mr Wu likely murdered the victim or know who did.""

And that is sort of the problem, the translators fail to capture the substance of the story by using only literal (or close to literal) translations. 

It is still an well made game. 

The other problem is the Devs made little effort to translate their Witcher-like in game card game, it involve getting the right cards  (In Chinese) to speak an certain poetic phase. Obviously, to English speakers, that is nearly impossible to play and the devs made it worse by not letting players take time to learn the tricks.",1579990416,1579990587,True,536,18,0.968717396259307861,25,True,False,False

Without a doubt! If you enjoy story-rich singleplayer roleplaying games with optional elements of crafting or playing cards, then this is a game I highly recommend!

I am writing this game after finally finishing, clocking 91hours of gametime (active).

Some extra information: the game is voiced in chinese, with optional subtitles for english/traditional chinese. The english translation is decent enough that most players will find it playable without being story/gamebreaking.

The artstyle is aesthetically pleasing, with traditional chinese elements, the music is well designed and gives scenes and areas different flavours.

The combat system feels fluid and I quickly understood how talent-points and combat skill application worked. 

A point I both enjoy and dislike is the auto-save feature. The game autosaves at intervals and is synchronized to the game servers. This is not a problem most of the time, except for certain times of the day where the game would stop as it could not connect to the game servers (serverupdate??) it is easily fixedafter waiting a few minutes and clicking reconnect.

This game is totally worth the time if you enjoy story driven game like the Witcher series. If you don't, then I don't think this game would be suitable for you. I must say that, after finishing one playthrough, I'm hoping to see the DLCs quests or sequel to this series.

[b]Pros:[b]
[list]
[*] You don't need to understand any Chinese to be able understand / immersed yourself in the game
[*] Similar to the Witcher series, some decisions may affect the game story, although it's not that much in this game. 
[*] The combat system is pretty good, I find the constellation system is interesting. Moreover, you can always reset your constellation skills if it doesn't suit your playstyle. Animations are very fluid as well.
[*] You don't need to play the prequel to understand / follow the story.
[/list] 

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*] There are a few bugs in this game, although it's not game breaking or whatever (e.g I encountered a ""bug348"" which doesn't let me to see one of the sidequest in the game)
[*] The game is for Singleplayer, yet you need an internet connection to access your save file, which might be a turn off for some people. 
[*] There are many miss-able achievements, although I understand that you will need multiple playthrough in the first place. However, I think missing an achievement that you're able to complete beforehand is a bit frustrating.
[/list]

[b]Extra:[/b]
[*] Warning: If you're playing outside China, everytime you launched the game I think you're required to select either East Asia server or North America like me, to be able to access your save file. Although it's very annoying I think this is game developer's strategy to combat piracy (not sure).
[*] Similar to Monster Hunter series, you will get access to your own personal farm, which you can upgrade to gain / craft more resources. You will need to upgrade your farm so that in order craft better armors and potions, which I think it could be a chore for some people. I personally find this farm system fun, since it's like taking a break from the combat. Although I'm a little bit dissapointed that the farm progress would be reset on New Game+
[*] Witcher has Gwent, Gujian has Lost Tales
[*] While the UI is very appealing, I think it is not the best for accessibility. (e.g I would prefer if there's some hotkey to access to the farm menu directly).",1579622264,1579622837,True,20,0,0.660439908504486084,0,True,False,False

There are also many interesting scenery that most players could not even notice. Although it is not perfect (DC problems during night), still a good game worth to play.

1. The home system feeling so unsatisfying and unnecessary.
2. The main character is acting like he is Sasuke from Naruto, I hated his personality and almost most of the character personality or talks are so dramatic and unreal, also the emotionless on their face. Those make me unable to get into the game.
3. The Final Boss fight is way too easy, easier than the red devil boss in the middle of the story, I can't feel stressed or epicness while the final boss fight.
Final boss ""robot"" fight is looking good, but still not intense or anything, it just a little fun game.
4. The story is just ok, maybe 6.5/10, not reach an amazing level and a lot of story background setting is hard to understand, The ending is also not satisfying, the boss was dead and people live on, that's it.

Just feel like it is an incompleted game and add tons of functions to it to make it rich, but actually not.

Despite being part of a series, you don't need to play the previous one to enjoy it.

-You have your own base where you can craft stuff (you’ll spend a lot of time on it). 

-There are cool visual customization options for your characters.

-You can reset the skill tree anytime in order to change your stats. 

-It’s really cheap for what the game offers you.  

-Great universe and lore overall.

-it’s a cool adventure.

-Challenge mode is really fun ( [spoiler] you only unlock this after you've beaten the game once [/spoiler] ) 

-There are some English mistakes BUT they translated the game, can’t complain.

-You can’t say that Yun’Wuyue or Cen Ying is waifu material because “waifu” is a Japanese term and since this is a Chinese game you’ll have to call them àiren (愛人).

-Yun’Wuyue.

[h1]  The Bad: [/h1]
	-Jumping sucks when you need it. 
	
-Onyx kingdom is the worst place in the world. 
	
-Moving sucks when you need to be precise, you get stuck and fall off platforms.
	
-You need to craft weapon skins and expend your precious materials every time you want to change how your weapon looks… how about a “Change weapon appearance” option on the equipment menu instead of WASTING MY METEORIC METAL EVERYTIME I WANT TO SEE HOW MY WEAPON LOOKS.  
	
-I’m stupid, I admit. But how in the name of **** do the chest puzzle works? I’ve spent countless seal papers on these chests. 

-The ending wasn’t really satisfying,  I was expecting a lot more and hoping to see what happens to some of the characters.  (There are rumors of a sequence or a DLC to see the rest of the story, but until then I don’t like the ending)

-Yun’Wuyue.

[h1] The “hmmmm”/ neutral : [/h1]
	-The story is good overall, the universe is full of lore, things glow, warriors fight, shadowchasers kill demons, magic swords etc. BUT…character development is bad, this might be a little bit nitpicking but I didn’t feel like the protagonist was changing. To be honest I didn’t get his personality at all, he is kinda emotionless and is hard to feel empathy for him.  I was expecting a lot of conflict between [spoiler]  his human nature (he was raised by a human family) and his fey blood, wasn’t he supposed to reflect about the human world and choose between living a human life or accept his burden as a shadowchaser king? That doesn’t happen; I didn’t feel a conflict at all.  The protagonist accepts his “destiny” with little resistance; there's a fight with xuange but after that he's like:""k, you won. I'll be king"", with no desire to come back to those who raised him and with little regard to his past on the human world [/spoiler] . B U T the universe has a lot of lore so you can overlook that depending on your perspective. In fact, you might not even care about this and love the story. As I said before: I might be nitpicking too much.
	
-Fishing minigame 
	
-Your saves are connected to the server, they’re not local and you can’t play offline (I’m putting this on neutral because I had no problems but some people had ) 
	
-You can’t play as other characters. Not a big deal, but be aware that you’ll play as Beiluo (  [spoiler] and Jinyun on flashbacks [/spoiler] ) for the whole game.  

-You fight 90% of the bosses alone. You might say “so what?” Answer:  What’s the point of buying good gear to your party members and choosing the right skills for them  if you’re going to be alone on tough fights? I felt dumb for buying expensive armor for Cen Ying, just put her on defensive stance and save money/materials. 

-Side Quests don’t have story, you just grab items and deliver to people. 

-Yun’Wuyue  

[h1] CONCLUSION: [/h1]
Great game it’s cheap and it’s fun. You won’t regret it.
Thank you Wangyuan Shengtang for translating this amazing  game and PLEASE translate Gujian 1 , Gujian 2 and future games so we can play them too!

That is that the games basically exhaust themselves in imitation of something with a much bigger budget or have too few resources in terms of manpower or technology to make a product that can live up to the modern gaming audiences' appetite for features and graphical prowess.

Gujian 3 does not suffer from this problem. It genuinely strives toward excellence in all aspects and only falls short in a few key areas. To prevent this recommendation from being overly negative and pointed let me say that the vistas and towns in this game are beautiful, and are clearly inspired by art and cultural artifacts that are not present in almost any other game available to English speakers commercially, certainly not of this level of polish anyway. The game plays in an interesting and fun way and the characters and narrative are probably structurally quite familiar to any RPG fan but are flavored in unique and endearing ways that may not be apparent at first glance. However, a number of the subsystems especially the Research mechanics are marred by a localization that is mostly serviceable but when Research is already frustrating due to being unable to fail even one step without being massively punished a single misplaced word, a single grammatical problem or awkward idiom causes it to be twice as painful. On top of that the localization occasionally makes story aspects harder to understand for a decent amount of time.

Finished it. I'm a fan now. Aside from the hiccups owing to the always-online DRM (couldn't play on China weekend prime time. Yay great firewall!) it was an enjoyable ride all the way to the end. Here's hoping we'll get the fourth game in the series in English too. Review updated below.

Positives:
- Gorgeous environment design and there's a ton of variations. Last few areas are especially stunning.
- Story feels pretty fresh compared to other stuff I've played. It managed to keep my interest till the end (I'm a serial game-dropper when I got bored halfway).
- Characters start out kinda cliche but becomes likable over time. Their motivations are believable. Character interactions are more grounded/subdued than your standard W/JRPG, so you have to read between the lines. Very well done in this regard.
- Music / ambient themes are excellent, particularly the main theme. Boss fight ones (usually where people put the best stuff) are just okay though.
- Good combat system (Responsive enough for action combat, multiple difficulty options - I played on the hardest one (Expert) and had just the right amount of challenge).
- Decently optimized (I have a mid-range system - i4590 and gtx 1070 and managed to hit 55-60fps on max settings).
- Unique setting (for western / japanese game enthusiasts).
- Price point (My regional pricing was 7 bucks - quite a steal. I think US pricing was 20? Still a bargain honestly at that price (As of the review, there was an ongoing 33% discount).
- Massive amount of content.
- Mini games. They're pretty fleshed out too. (FISHING!!!, farming/housing system, card game, puzzle platformer, and some weird ass thing i can only describe as Monopoly on steroids).
- Relatively bug free. 

Negatives:
- ALWAYS-ONLINE DRM (East Asia server particularly sucks, read the very first line. I hear they usually remove it after a year or so?)
- Animations and facial expressions for non main-characters is a bit lacking.
- Some cutscenes are kinda dodgy both in placement and quality. At certain points in the game, they give you control of your MC only to walk a few steps in between multiple cutscenes. Some of the action ones cut out too early, and the audio level seems a bit low on them. The ones that feature multiple characters are choppy.
- Loot is subpar - There's not much variation. 99% of items you find are crafting materials or healing items. Lots of times you find a secret area/cranny of sorts and it had absolutely nothing... One particular optional 'dungeon' in late game had an area that's hard to reach but there's only a fishing spot at the end. Basically, one of the cardinal sins of RPGs.
- Itemization is boring. There are weapon and armor skins and accessories but they don't confer any stats. There are gems you can socket to weapon/acc for stats but they're kind of basic (attack,defense, elem defense/attack, crit % and multiplier, stam regen, etc).
- World design looks nice but superficial (can't enter any buildings, beautiful looking areas but lots of invisible walls).


Neutral:
- English translation (it's very competent but could be better - slightly too literal. Plenty of typos too). The in-game codex is very nice to read though, not as long-winded as other games (looking at you, Bioware).
- Controller support (you can rebind everything, except stuff like mid-combat finisher prompts don't swap around - that means you can't bind dodge to B/Circle).
- Some menus feel a bit cumbersome to navigate with a controller.
- Research minigames(part of housing/crafting) are just bonkers. They ask you DIFFICULT multiple choice questions about medieval crafting/physics among other stuff. Not only you can't find most of em online, you are also on a short timer. You get one out of 2/3 wrong, either you lose materials/money or... you just load a previous save. I learned something from em, but I feel there's a better way to do it. I ended up just save scumming through the ones I fail (and I failed A LOT).
- Draw distance is a bit short - getting a lot of texture pop-ins even when all settings are maxed. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The devs cut some corners in presentation, but it's understandable probably due to budget constraints (see the negatives above).
All in all this is a very respectable entry into the English speaking market for a Chinese dev/publisher. For the price, I felt I got my money's worth, and more.

It is a superb game, truly worth 60 bucks IMO. But that’s the thing… you can get it for 10 times less nowadays. Do yourself a favor and if you like Action RPGs BUY IT! Just remember, this is a very linear game and its split into small areas, there are no choices to make or huge maps to explore etc.

So I like to start with the big negatives first, so people know what’s up and there are two:
-I should honestly give the game a negative review for this TBH, but I love it too much. The game has an ALWAYS ONLINE SAVE SYSTEM. It’s just stupid and well…you know…horrible. I’ve had moments where the game takes longer to save or it just stops so the servers load your file. I would totally understand if someone refuses to buy it for this reason.
-Sadly the translation. Currently it’s very rough. I really don’t care if they misspell a word or mix up “a” and “an”, but it is much worse and sometimes you will actually struggle to understand what the characters are trying to actually say. All this plus the fact that the game is heavily based on Asian philosophical matters that I’m sure gets a lot of things lost in translation. Overall it’s not a deal breaker tho and they are patching in more translation corrections. But if that annoys you, well...there you go.

Let’s break it down further:
+STORY is the main focus of the game. There are a massive amount of cutscenes, all voiced (in Chinese of course). The story itself is quite interesting and complex and goes from simple matters to deciding the fate of all the land, as most RPGs do. Characters are deep and engaging, with quite a lot of history to uncover and the way the story unravels is quite good.

+COMBAT is the second focus and it is very good indeed. If you played Witcher 3 you’ll know exactly what you’re doing: dodging, parrying and using skills in a FANTASTICALLY animated Action game. You also get 3 teammates with you that look super cool and you can use their special abilities to help you. Bosses are also really cool looking and fun to fight (tho for some reason all bosses are made to be 1v1).

+MUSIC is PHENOMNAL and there is a LOT of it…every area, boss fight, task etc has its own track of, I guess, classical Chinese music. Very beautiful stuff.

+CRAFTING… I hate crafting…but in this game let me tell you it is sooo well implemented. You not only craft skins and accessories, but you have AN ENTIRE ISLAND of your own to customize with decorations, people you hire and things you craft. On top of that RESEARCH has a super cute minigame that had me hooked for hours upon hours. It makes you play as a cute fluffy BOI and you have to help your artisans by answering question about the item you craft, bringing them the right tool etc. Fantastic stuff.

+GRAPHICS are quite good. The game shows a bit of age, but the animations are superb and the vistas you get to see are amazing, all crafted with care and desktop background worthy.

+SOUND. There are no big spells you can use sadly that sound cool, or amazing voice acting, everything is just ok.


-Cutscenes…oh man this game has way too many. You have moments where you literally enter an area get a cutscene, get an objective to walk forward, you do for like 2 seconds, another cutscene. It’s frustrating sometimes how they just interrupt you so often.

-I really don’t get why you can’t play as your other 3 characters…it seems totally doable 

-the game is showing a bit of age overall, nothing is too detailed up close, except maybe the characters, but the worst thing by far is the laughable draw distance for foliage…its like literally 10-15 meters ahead of you…ugh

-the UI could be better, especially the indicator that shows you’re about to get attacked is far to large and gets in your way (you can turn the UI off at any time tho)

-Unless I missed some of them, the main character has almost no outfits to speak of, kind of a bummer since your other characters get 3 or 4

I very much enjoyed it and can’t wait to see more games from these devs. Hopefully with a bit more budget allocated for the localization/transalions and with the removal of that CRAPPY always online saving.

Playing on High graphics settings, I experienced minor frame rate issues only during combat scenes with many NPCs or when moving my camera around a bit too fast. I'm sure it could be fixed by playing on a slightly lower setting, but I'm able to deal with it to enjoy the picturesque landscapes in the game.

The hair and cloth physics are done very well. I haven't noticed a single bug with the hair or clothing, and that's not something I can so about most games (even Red Dead Redemption 2 is no exception!). 

As far as general game mechanics, it plays like an RPG with a Souls-style combat system (or Witcher-style, if you prefer). Simply lock onto an enemy and spam your light and heavy attacks, throwing in a mix of unique abilities every so often. My only qualm with the combat is that you can't easily shift between locked targets, making it hard to focus the camera on the target you want to attack. Still though, combat is fluid and (on Normal difficulty), equal parts challenging and heroic.

Customization (thus far, as I've only put about 6 hours in at the time of this review), leaves a lot to be desired. I've only unlocked one new customization piece in my 6 hours of play, and it was an armor piece. When equipped, I realized that it was for stat-benefit only, as the appearance of my armor did not change. Another note on customization: armor comes in sets, meaning if at some point there is different-looking armor aside from the starting garb, it will affect torso, arms and legs. Head gear appears to be it's own slot, but I've yet to find any in-game.

The story itself is quite dramatic but not incredibly hard to follow. I won't touch too much on the content of the plot, but it harkens back to the ""hero of yore""/""chosen one"" fantasy stories, all about living up to a certain title, etc. However the story itself, and thus the pace of the game, is incredibly slow. In my four hours of playing I still feel as though I'm just scratching the surface of the exposition and I've got no clues as to where this story could be going. 

I've been looking forward to an English translation of this game since its release, and perhaps I hyped myself up too much because the game is not as stunning as I'd hoped it to be. That being said, my general conclusions would be: The combat (while mildly repetitive in nature) is fun and the bosses toe the line between annoying and challenging, with some dipping into both sides. The graphics are amazing with very few issues, and I'd go as far as to say that there'd be no issues on a relatively high-end PC. The translation isn't perfect, but it's a remarkable job done in such a short time and it's made this game accessible to players like me, so I've nothing but thanks for the translators. Finally, the story is slow and a bit cliche, the protagonist a bit too brooding, and the other characters in the story a bit too boring. Nothing about the story is enticing me as of yet, but just because it isn't my cup of tea doesn't mean it won't be someone else's. 

Despite my issues with the game, I'm so glad I can finally play it in English, and it's still a game I'd recommend to most.

Edit: I should add: I've not played the previous installments in the series, so that may affect my perception of the story's pacing. Perhaps that's just how these games are. Regardless, do with that as you will.",1576122873,1576183231,True,8,2,0.578805088996887207,2,True,False,False

Combat is fluid, story is very VERY deep, crafting is quite extensive but only unlocks after 20 hours in and the game world is stupidly pretty. The quality and setting combine to give visual treat to the eyes every moment.

Less awesomely however, the game is always online (a big ugh) and will kick you out because of that. Customization is very limited with a single skill tree for each character that winds up being either identical or very small in choices. Difficulty spikes dramatically.

In the midling you have the minigames. There are entire minigames built for small sections, these can be fun, or tedious. The crafting research ones are especially annoying and you're quizzed on things you cannot possibly know (by your workers who clearly know bugger all themselves) and getting a single wrong answer means wasted materials and trying again.

The full time connected requirement sucks, but I guess that's something we can't do anything about. Like some people have mentioned, piracy here is nothing compared with China's so if getting this little gem means having to deal with that, I am not going to complain.
That being said, the game is awesome.
Pros:
- It looks gorgeous. Graphics wise, the game looks amazing. Nice models, cities are detailed and alive, and the few environments I've been so far are distinctive and rich.
-History. I've been playing JRPGs for the most part of my life and this game is a nice departure from traditional Japanese tropes. It is more restrained in fantasy and feels more grounded. Additionally, it is a nice change to swap mythologies. The characters are well developed and the main character is not your usual mindless hero.
Cons:
-Lack of graphical options. The game allows you to choose between several predetermined configurations but you can't pick resolution or anything too advanced.
-Controls. Combat feels fluid at times and clunky most of the time. The platform sections are a nightmare and well luck parrying or avoiding chain attacks from the bosses.
-UI. I asked in the community hub for a map and was told that I could bring it up by pressing a button. 11 hours in and still can't find it. This is kind of annoying because the game throws at you several sidequests that are hard to follow once you change areas. 

Overall, it is great that they released the English patch. The game makes for a nice addition to my collection and while it is not perfect, one can only hope that the game sells well enough for some changes to be implemented in future instances of the series.",1575131942,1575131942,True,2,0,0,1,True,False,False

the story is moving, but the 3D movements are kind of stupid , especially in maze... some mazes only have one path....as we know...the witch series, guild wars series, AC series....also exist many methods to discover and behave....after the story ending..you cant continue playing in the HuaXia area....

Gujian 3 runs on VisionEngine with full support for nVidia GameWorks. This means the title has full support for both nvidia Ansel and FreeStyle, and because it's not competitive game, it means you can use both on photomode and normal FreeStyle all ReShade filters without restrictions. The game, as far as I have ascertained so far, does not feature any other kind of Photo Mode. 

The Graphics settings are pretty standard, you can change view range, sunlight effects, SSAO, Grass Density and others to name a few. The graphic settings are also changeable via Geforce Experience. The game features Borderless Windowed and Windowed mode. There is no setting for Exclusive Fullscreen nor V-sync. This means that the FPS will be uncapped and you need to use external program to limit the frames to 60, should you so choose to. On the other hand, it also means it works really nicely with 144hz or higher displays, granted you have the hardware to run it. 
The video performance is pretty stable, and I experienced no stuttering 'cause frametime or FPS. Curiously though, the engine itself seems to stutter a bit in the cutscenes, yet the FPS is stable at 60.

On the Audio side, the audio is working, yet for me it ran in 2.0 instead of 5.1 setting. 

The game features Always Online - mode where all the saves are handled by a remote server either in Asia or in U.S. If the connection cuts off, you are unable to save and your progress will be lost. This game features no Offline Mode as far as I know. To select which server you use, you need to choose it from the prompt when launching from your library. Using default shortcut will make the selection for you, so if you choose to use different server later on, your saves won't move with that choice.

The translation is pretty well done, but unfortunately there are quite many errors and some rather unique expressions like instead of ""Experience acquired"" the game uses ""Get Exp"". The game has subtitles for the Mandarin voiceovers, so do not expect to find English voice acting in the game. Subtitles also don't look like to be shortened, so not much should be lost in translation, although some expressions are not translated.

The action and combat system has its potential, but for this one it's mediocre at best.  Combats are often visually stunning but also a bit chaotic. Also, it's not rewarding enough for skillful play. (I'm not in the mood to write a 1k-word critic so you will have to experience it yourself for an hour or two, but you have been warned)

Boss fight is the most outstanding part. Each boss has their own patterns and abilities, so you will need to learn and adjust your strategy accordingly, which is challenging and fun. However, fights with mobs can quickly become tedious.

Other than the combat, it's a good looking game (though it could be better if the animation outside the combat can be improved), that provides you satisfying storytelling and home-building experience (though a bit grinding for me).

The game is pretty much your standard semi-open world RPG (a salute to The Gate of Firmament and Chinese Paladin 6 for being one of the first these kinds of Chinese RPG games with English on Steam). The graphic is really beautiful. 
There are 3 ways to play the game: RPG, ACT, and Controller. So pick your style! I went with the controller btw. 

The story is very lengthy and cut-scenes heavy. If you have played the previous games, Xuan Yuan Sword or Chinese Paladin, this shouldn't come as a surprise. Of course this won't be for everyone but I personally like it. And stay true to the tradition there is romance but it will take an entire game to build up slowly. I'm a sucker for well developed, slow-burning romance after all.

No, you don't have to play the previous games to understand the story. However, if you played them there are few references for you. The in-game encyclopedia is very helpful if you are confused about the characters. They include a picture and a little text for you and if it's a returning character they will mention it (such as our heroine from Gujian 1).

The card game is just massive previous games homage xD There are so many cute and sad references (I only play 40% of Gujian 1 but I already notice so many neat references). But don't worry, they make sure to help you by stating what kind of cards combination you can make on the right side when you select a card.

The game itself is very enjoyable, the graphics is good and the scenery is honestly superb. The story isn't anything weird, but it's definitely a bit different from the usual western game. 

The english translation is really well done, there are only very minor mistakes like using ""this"" instead of ""those"" in a few instances, but it's not really a problem, the dialog is still easily understandable. Gameplay wise everything is translated so you'll have an easy time understanding things. You have various control schemes to fit your playstyle. The sense of difficulty varies between people, but I'd say the game itself is slightly harder than expected. The gameplay consists of mostly action rpg combat with abilities, character progression and crafting and the likes. There is a slight variation to spice things up later in the game, you can also expect a bit of platforming and a few puzzles and mini games. 

Your two main companions are pretty serious but they have this hidden side to them that I find really funny. Overall I like the side quests and interactions with the companions and other characters. The game usually runs at a pretty serious tone that's sometimes broken in just the right way, you'll understand when you play it.

The only bad things I can say is that the town npcs, so basically the unimportant people on the streets don't really have idle animations so they look a bit odd while speaking, it's not really distracting but still noteworthy. This and the menu takes a bit of time to get used to, but it only gets really noticeable in the crafting menus. 

One huge negative I sadly have to say is that the game NEEDS an internet connection as it stores your saves on some server on the other side of the planet. I have no clue why this is neccesary because I doubt this would stop pirates. The game doesn't even have a multiplayer function so really, it would be great if the developer got rid of this limitation, I'm sure it costs money and I doubt it makes the game any better.

TLDR:
Great game, go play it. Stores your saves on some unknown server on the other side of the world tho. NEEDS internet to work.",1574252194,1574252194,True,23,3,0.631889581680297852,0,True,False,False

It's obvious that they took care in doing so as well, the UI and the syntax are quite well done.  So far, i have only noticed minor grammar errors in the subtitles (and one short narration that was miss altogether) and the UI is flawless.

Game has solid control options, for M&KB as well as XBone.  Everything feels intuitive and there are no odd scheme choices.

The game itself is a thing of beauty, the world, the characters and the music are all superb.

Thank you!

NOTES:

This game is staggeringly beautiful.  The scale of the levels is epic, the fantasy setting is incredible.  Everything looks gorgeous.

I haven't seen anything from a western developer in years which gave me such a breathless, awestruck sense of wonder, just looking at the setting.

From the very beginning, you are given an interactive work of art, art a brief tutorial level, they throw an epic boss battle at you, which reminded me of Musou fantasy games, when they are hack and slash, it was quite fun.

Combat is fun, and will only get better as i unlock more skills.

I an American, white man.  Kind of a bro, I suppose.  However, for many years now, I have loved Chinese historical fantasy movies, and this is the first game I have ever played that gave me the same overall vibe.

I am very, very happy with it.

I am glad I can support developers making games like this, and would like to see more of this type of  content.

As a side note, there a some segments that are handled by cinematic's which would have been even better if they have been more interactive like COD does sometimes or the Lord of Shadow games, but so far, this has been my only issue, and it's a matter of preference...  (my ideal game would be almost no cut scenes, replacing them with in level dialogue or set pieces.)

I am only at 3 hours as i write this...   I will update as I continue playing.

The only con I have found with the game, animations and video edit for the cutscenes are not very good. For animation, you wont be seen them doing much except for talking to each other most of the time, at least so far. It is probably design choice, but basically you can see in one frame there is nothing and next there will be monsters without context where they came from. Another example, there is this one house that is perfectly fine, and then suddenly in gets destroyed, you would expect at least a small animation how it is destroyed, but instead basically in one frame the house is perfectly fine and the next is just looks destroyed. 

But to be honest is does not really bother me much, I mean for the price they are asking I think is perfectly fine.

Nonetheless, when I did compare FFXV with Gujian 3, I would say it's story was way better than FFXV even though the graphic may not be able to reach to the FFXV's standard.

Verdict: 9/10 

Pros: 
-Excellent Story
-Addictive Gameplay (Fights)
-Emotional Dialogues especially with companions
-Addictive Research and Production of Items, Equipment, Decorations and Fashions for both Playable characters and Companions
-Grow your own HOME 
-Story related side-quests 

Cons:
-City is too large until the extend of feeling empty 
-Item farming from killing mobs is just least appealing
-Resource gathering from surrounding environment is too little",1557938982,1557938982,True,14,1,0.641811132431030273,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- No FPS cap at 60
- Really smooth combat, active dodge and block skills are always fresh
- The graphics are stunningly pretty
- Really like how you can reset ""traits"" from the menu
- You can skip cutscenes if you want, no forced cutscenes like some JRPGs

Neutral/kinda bad:
- Jumping is a bit awkward / weird, can't really pinpoint it just feels slightly off to me
- Everything is in CHINESE. Limits the audience :(
- Side quests are kinda boring

古劍3可以說是我多年後的第二款武俠遊戲

整體感覺其實還真的不錯，
但有些部分就顯得太過拖沓

家園系統是其一
但我個人不多說這部分

就戰鬥而言，個人是還迫有微言。

首先古劍3的戰鬥節奏意外的大同小異且無趣
主要是你使用技能時，你需要那3條集氣棒
你要使用技能前，必先要至少要有一絛集氣棒
要有集氣棒，你要先普攻

而古劍3戰鬥一結束
你原本集滿了的集氣棒又會歸零
在下一場戰鬥開始時，你又要開始普攻集氣了
造成了古劍3的技能使用率還滿低的。

最後古劍3的戰鬥就會變成以下模式

碰怪開局
普攻集氣
放技能或普攻到底
戰鬥結束

可以說局局都一樣的感覺

我強烈建議，
取消掉每每戰鬥結束就會讓集氣棒歸零的設定
或者只減去一條氣棒的設定，但不是歸零的設定

這樣每一局開局，玩家可以選擇直接使用技能
而不是都在普通開局了？？

這可以讓古劍3的戰鬥更加有趣…

玩了整幾十個小時，真的還蛮無聊的。。。

The game introduces you to different features of the game, somewhat too slowly I think. Battle system may be a little bit hard and sometimes I just feel like I wanna skip the battle and go ahead with the story.

The battle system works like Final Fantasy XV, you have companions. You will be able to level up character, assign skill points to whatever skill build that you prefer (or remove them and put the skill points to a different slot later). This flexible skill build system is good, as it allows you to play according to different style that you prefer. You can also summon creatures (with individual summoning cooldown) that you have defeated to help you in the battle, each of them have unique ability that can either heal / debuff / disable the enemies. Once summoned, they will cast the spell and disappear.

You will also have crafting and creatures hunting later in game when you have discovered a little dimension where you can build and create your own home. It allows you to use your creatures to do the work for you, each of them with special perks like ""Reducing mining time"", ""Increase loot drops for treasure hunting"", etc. You can also explore the world and hire people to work for you.

The environment design is breathtaking too, it's really obvious the world designer has put alot of efforts into creating multiple amazing world / dimensions. There are certain ""View the surrounding"" hotspot where the camera will be showing you the hardwork of the world designer. You can also press F2 to change into Photo mode.

All in all, it is a very nice game.",1550395838,1550395838,True,8,1,0.62430262565612793,0,True,False,False

Only thing that is making this game hard for me to play, is the fact that its only in chinese. I really wish they will add english subtitles some day.

- attention to detail, great graphics creating authetic Chinese culture/atmosphere
- well optimized, smooth gameplay
- good action/fights
- relatively interesting story
- the ""home"" system is a nice touch
- some small games eg. cards also provide good break from normal play

Cons
- requires constant internet access for server authentication - server sometimes doesn't work very well, which leads to inability to save game progress
- linear story. Minimal choices available
- companions not that well developed with not many companion specific, interesting side quests
- side quests in general quite boring
- a bit lacking in the RPG component - leveling does not really provide much opportunities for character customization
- side quests generally uninteresting

[b]Graphic: Catched up with the trend[/b] 
Because of lack of fund, this game still uses Havok engine, which has already long stopped technical support, in other words, somehow outdated. Surprisingly, its graphic quality is not. The scenes that you see is just good enough, fly in the ointment is the characters, which is still several years behind the top level. Of course we can not just compare it to the recent 3A games. But as a game in 2018, it meets all the expactations.

[b]Music: Job done, with surprise[/b]
 I don't think the music is overall impressive like Gujian1, but it fits the game well creating the required atmosphere. Maybe due to the budget, some BGMs that appeared in Gujian1 and Gujian2 are used again. Personally I thought the best melody was the BGM of Tian Lu Cheng, however the ending BGM says no. Probably it's again the budget problem that we only have static pictures in place of ending CG, but the ending BGM is so shocking that the expressive of the ending is not insufficient at all.

[b]Gameplay: Revolutionary[/b] 
For more than 20 years the Chinese RPG games almost always use turn-based system. Aurogon tried to switch to real-time system in Gujian2, unfortunately was not that successful. As we doubt if Aurogon will be conservative and return to turn-based system again, Aurogon did it. It was quite a risky but great move and it is all we ever want, it is a REVOLUTION. The battle system is not as good as the classic act games, for example Devil May Cry, but at least it makes fun and feels not bad. In the maps we are finally partially able to move more freely, jump on the roofs and take some clever shortcuts. However we can't request Aurogon to build an open world like Assassin's Creed. Can be much better, but glad to see this change.

[b]Story: Commendable[/b] 
The main theme is HERITAGE in this generation. No spoiler here, but it is surely attractive and compact, almost no boring parts. I want to say that in this game we don't have passionate love between two of the main characters, and no heroine is sacrificed to gain some tears from the players. The main characters deserve the ending for their personality and ablity, 100% logical smooth.

[b]Details: Not easy to notice, but amazing[/b]
 Have you ever noticed that even a unremarkable negative character has his own life story written in game? Have you ever noticed that the dialogs between the NPCs change with the development of the story and you can learn what they have experienced? This game I can see full sincerity of the developer.

+The brightest light of Chinese games in the endless darkness
+Revolutionary total breakthrough (Graphic+Gameplay)
+Attractive and compact story with convincing ending
+The developers have really devoted their efforts in this game (Most of the bads are due to lack of money)
+The price is just toooooooo cheap

-Still way to go to catch up the top games
-Ideas of development a litte bit outdated
-No English support

个人是剧情控，对于这一代的剧情感觉还可以，能看出来其主题是传承。一开始我原以为主线是修复天鹿城大阵，结果是牵扯到古时人族的爱恨情仇，感觉修复天鹿城大阵反而变成次要的。然后后面的剧情会突然转到别人的视角或梦境里，我个人有时候会感到出戏，我知道这些都是有存在的意义的但有没有办法让这些衔接的更好呢？

操控方面烛龙应该有方向了，毕竟比上一代好太多，有没有可能加双跳或小段空中停留飞行之类的操控让战斗方法更多元化？毕竟也有战斗控的玩家。然后就是那个射刀的攻击，感觉有点没什么意义，打怪又太弱，还不如发展成投射技能，装备符咒就是投符咒，什么冰封啊烈火啊爆炸啊闪光啊各种属性，装备匕首刀剑可以加强伤害之类的。然后就是为什么只能用主角？

画面的话，场景漂亮但人物表情好呆板，这我倒觉得不是烛龙的问题，估计经费不足没什么好说。

还有就是怪的类型有点少了，尤其是魔，好多长差不多。 有个想法就是如果能做多一点辟邪的模型出来，天鹿城大战时能看到很多人变回真身跟魔战斗会更有感觉，一城的辟邪全用人形战斗，死的时候也是人感觉怪怪的。

家园系统还是可以的，但我不是特别外装控，费那么多时间搞个外装感觉有点浪费时间，能不能每个外装加一点不同属性？雷抗啊，反伤啊，多一个小技能啊什么的，会比较让我有欲望去费时间搞这个。。

还有像boss奖励方面给多点好东西吧，每次打完心里都在想打这么辛苦就给我这个？

最后是音乐，好像。。。。没上代好？

以上都是个人意见啊，可能很多人不同意，单纯表达一下个人的想法而已。

总得来说瑕不掩瑜，我很期待古剑3DLC和古剑4，希望大家多多支持烛龙让他们有更多的经费制作更好的游戏，也希望有一天古剑奇谭能发展成大IP就像最终幻想那样，这里祝古剑大卖！

This game is probably one of the best Chinese RPG ever made so far! Its story is a little weaker then Gujian1 and much less romance than both Gujian1 and Gujian2, but it instead focus much more around its theme of 传承 (loosely translated to ""Inheritance"" or ""Handing down through the generations"")! I also liked how each version of the series focused on a different Chinese Mythological God/saint, 女娲 for Gujian1, 神农 for Gujian2 and 黄帝 for gujian3! Good continuity of theme.

Greatest improvement over previous gen：
- MUCH better graphics than the previous two generations! 
- MUCH better optimization for PC as well (definitely playable on a entry-level gaming laptop/desktop today)
- MUCH better combat system that's actually smooth and yet very challenging
- Good attempt at the home base system which is tied to resource generation
- Story was not too long, but tons of side quests to do if you are interested in the lore of the game
- Good character building (they don't feel shallow, you get a good idea of their motivations throughout the game)

Before I do any reviews, I must brief a little background of video game industry in my hometown. Simply speaking, our video game industry is still a baby comparing to other western countries and Japan. Though we have been developing in this field for years, we are merely focusing on online games (and mobile games recently) due to both market and policy issues. Thus, as a single-player ARPG in such negative video game environment, Gujian 3 amazes me a lot.

As a pure RPGer focusing only on ancient-age fantasy games (I don't like games with firearms or sci-fi), I have played lots of superior RPGs, both online and single-player, including Skyrim, The Elder Scroll Online, WOW, The Witcher, Zelda, Dragon Age, Final Fantasy, Divinity, etc.  To be honest, Gujian 3 is not on the same notch of most of these games. However, it is a huge improvement among many Chinese Xianxia(tales and kungfu) RPGs. Though the story is in similar style as most Xianxia games, Gujian 3 does speak a clear ideology. Rather than saving the world or epic-like love story (sometime love story crossing creature races), Gujian 3 is trying to display an idea of inheritance through out ancient Chinese history, and through 4 controllable roles, it does make me feel such magnificence.

Other than the story-telling, the action-based fighting style, role growth system, home construction and some other ways of playing are just common additions like most other RPGs. Improvements are needed, but worth playing definitely. Fights are challenging for newbies in action games but not that hard. It is not open-world game (you cannot make a good open-world game with only millions dollars investment). In summary, Gujian 3 is worth playing for those who want to experience Chinese fictional stories while not being bored by turn-based fighting styles (and, unfortunately, you have to be sophisticated in Chinese, at leats for now).",1545421875,1545421875,True,558,12,0.959032297134399414,32,True,False,False

Played for about 50 hours with the original purchase.

From a technical aspect, the game comes short in some ways than the AAA titles,  but the graphics are at least decent, enjoyable even, with it's distinct Chinese fantacy style. The fighting system may not that in-depth, and get a little repetitive if you are expecting a GOD-of-War level combat experience, but combat is fluent enough, and can be challenging at high difficulty.

The home building system is quite addictive though, can't stop (thinking about commanding my minions) finishing, farming, mining, exploring for goodies. ☺

What the game offers is the unique experience set in ancient Chinese mythology, with fitting music, immersive character design, affecting main plot, and touching relationship development. The bound between the hero and the heroine comes natural, and is expressed with a elegant approach that feels quite different than the couterparts in western culture.

First of all, this is the BEST Chinese ARPG game out there!

You can't find the same art style in other games, it's just stunning beautiful while keeping most of the scenes in Chinese ancient theme.

The dialog/audio is in high quality, it feels natural and align with each role's charcter. There are full of surprises in the story line as well.

BTW I love the background music!

The real time combat system and the control feels really smooth and keep me exciting, especially in the boss fight. Bosses' skills are variant so you have to think the strategy when fight them. I'd like to mention though it feels a bit clumsy you can't use the treasure scan ability while aiming destructable with knife during treasure hunt. There are some fun mini games in there as well: fishing, puzzle resolving, cards, traditional Chinese puppet show, etc. 

I've bought the official original version, but I want to buy steam version as well to review and to support the team!

It's a huge pity there is no other languages other than Simplified Chinese. I really hope they can add other languages at least English subtitle so player in the world outside of China can also understand&enjoy this master piece.

A tip for developer for how to earn money if you can see this: Try to port it to X1 and PS4 along with other languages support.
