While I have bounced off the last few XCOM games, this has grabbed me like no other turn based tactics title has. The combat is clever, challenging and satisfying.

It just starts so poorly, and this coming from a JA2 veteran who adored that game and played it to death.  I think the problem is you just start with less than nothing, and it's a grueling load fest as you struggle to grasp the mechanics while also trying to catch up in equipment to your enemies who are AK-47 armed as you begin with pistols and maybe a poor SMG.

However, after giving JA3 more time, I see it's really an incredible game.  I don't know if it's AAA, but I can feel the passion and dedication and luv poured into the game.  There is SO much dialogue from characters, everything getting so much VO and all the mercenaries talking to each other and quipping is amazing to listen to in their fun voices.  The iconic characters from the series actually have personality in this game, they aren't awful bland generic stereotypes.  They're fun, and funny!

And once you get a grasp on the mechanics, and get some proper equipment to fight with, the midgame really takes off as you're running around getting money, shootin, lootin, customizing gear and equipment, and finding new toys to play with all the time.

I can really tell they poured an immense amount of effort into the content, there are SO many quests, and SO many of them have many different outcomes.  This is a game they designed for people to have extremely long playthroughs, and there is enough different quest outcomes that you really need many playthroughs to see all outcomes for events and the game itself.  40 hours in, I still haven't completed a full playthrough of the game, because I'm enjoying the sheer wealth of side-missions and amount of stuff to see and do.

The dev team did an awesome job!

I'd buy merc packs, weapon expansions and DLC's galore from these guys without a doubt. Just a quality game with no micro-transactions or other scummy corporate business tactics.

The only negative thing I could say is perk system definitely could use an overhaul. It's odd that the perks are only based on like 5 of the stats. So you get explosives perks being tied to things like strength or dexterity instead of the explosives skill. Or sniper perks not based on marksmanship.

I have played it slow and saw 3 patches untill i finished my run, very obvious the devs created something they love as each patch added some nice things. The nods to the previous games made me smile often. The only thing that i did not like was the fact that only some enemies drop loot. Even the low tier enemies should drop something simple as they were just shooting at me before.

A few things i would like to see:

Would be nice to get 'captured' or a chance to when your squad gets wiped or some kinda betrayal in your midst, you could hire some other mercs and try to free them (they might be fatigued, leave or have ptsd afterwards).

Bobby ray's deliveries should be possible in every town/port. 

Money makes the world go around, i ended my campaign with over 2 mil. You should be able to do more with your money. Buy off legion plebs to leave a sector peacefully, get a gunboat to take on patrols while roaming the rivers/sea, get aerial drops likes bombs and ofc a CHOPPAH.

Thank you for making this game, you realy made an old(er) guy happy after all the mishaps this IP had to endure.

Want to hide behind a wall of a house blocking the enemy sight line?  forget it, he knows exactly where you are and is now unloading his clip through a solid wall to hit you, on the exact square that you hide on.

So your village gets attacked and you want to set an ambush on them? forget it, the game designers think its more realistic to give you only a couple of deployment zones, in the MIDDLE of town, so the enemies get to full cover before you can even engage them. Why are deployment zones even a thing?

Both enemies and yourself take a ridiculous amount of damage before death, sometimes like 20 high calibre bullets in some cases. One shot kills are almost impossible unless your literally point blank range.

Explosions in this game are very soft and friendly, theres even a NPC named Boombastic who literally explodes things on herself while your talking to her, i found it neither funny or realistic, it was actually super immersion breaking. Whoever thought her up needs a paddlin. You will need more than 2 grenades to kill most enemies, who are African with no shirt on LOL

The ranges of the weapons are so off, 10 paces away with a pistol you will miss most times, even at the highest aim setting. I think the ranges for all weapons need to be doubled.

It doesnt have the AAA polish of the Firaxis hit, but its still a very compelling game, with huge choice of characters and guns.

I did two consecutive back to back playthroughs, with increasing difficulty and select mods in the second playthrough, and found a lot of joy each time.

Minor polish issues exist. The melee attack animations are very robotic and odd (again, compared to the deeply satisfying slashes and assassinations XCOM showed a decade+ ago).

Balance issues definitely exist (notably, long range guns/builds being far too effective). The problem is that there is little reason to use the many pistols, shotguns and SMGs that exist in the game. There is definitely a clear hierarchy among the guns and you will eventually settle on those handful of options, which to me is poor gameplay, because by midgame the joy of finding new guns is gone. (some mods, notably 'Ton of Guns' fixes this - NOTE: you must download and ENABLE the mod ingame).

All in all, a big thumbs up from me - anyone can see i compulsively play TBT games and that JA3 held my time and attention for 2 playthroughs is a HUGE credit to it, in an ocean of XCOM clones.

Cons: the characters are almost, too likeable... I get the sense I'm supposed to switch out my mercenaries, hire legendary ones when I can handle their costs, but that means losing the characters who've been with me on this journey. Some mercenaries won't be hired, either for some random unpredictable reason, or because they refuse to be hired by the same employer as another mercenary. This gets, annoying, especially when I have no way to know ahead of time. You look through the lists, make a plan, start hiring and... oh, this one just doesn't feel the time is right... oh, this one I just hired precluded this other one...
As more games in this sort of genre tends to have, aiming is a pain. There's little indicator if you'll hit or not, except for a list of bonuses or detriments, which was rarely helpful. Eventually I found the most predictable units were those I gave sniper rifles to, or melee weaponry.

Overall, the game was pretty decent, part of me wishes I'd felt inclined to poke every nook and cranny, but the game feels a little long, there wasn't much sense of development, but for slightly better weapons. Characters all have unique skills which, feels like it must lend itself to some overpowering strategies but it never seemed to quite appear, not with the minimal opportunities to improve them or teach them new skills.

Pros:

- faithful to the JA1 and 2 formula
- graphically quite pretty 
- rather minimal amounts of jenk
- substantial campaign, with a substantial amount of side content
- Excellent (over the top action-heroey humor and characterization, although some classic mercenaries were given a much less interesting personality. e.g: Igor Dolvich is lovely, his uncle Ivan  (in the cover art)  has as much personality as a bucket of apples.
- Plot was interesting and the world lore was developped,  much more so than similar games in the genre (X-com for instance)
- Rather good weapon system and feel, albeit not always extremely straightforward with stats and presentation.

Cons:

- Rather graphically demanding game, somewhat unintuitive dlss res scaling settings, make sure to tune reflections down because those will tank your GPU.
- Likes to freeze during the AI's turn and needs to be closed and restarted (mitigated by autosaves at start and end of battles) Happened to me about 12 times over the course of a campaign.
- Rather longish in terms of a campaign, the issue with that was that you hit the tech tier ceiling a long time before you're done with the campaign, which makes the latter part less interesting as the loot ceases to matter. 
- The game systems are a lot if you're new to the J.A formula and the game can be overwhelming at the start and may need several restarts to figure what you can and can't do both on the tactical mapsas well as on the battlefield. 
- The inventory system is a rather large let-down. It's just not well done from a UI standpoint, has a terrible presentation that is unclear, cluttered and involves a ton of mousewheeling to try and appreciate what you have by the mid game, and gets worse over time.


Overall, an easy recommend, especially if you enjoyed jagged alliance 1 and 2. Excellent game, with modding support that can in my eyes become a great platform for more content in the future, such as smaller campaigns, single maps scenarios/operations etc.

It places the series back at the forefront of the genre, offering a richness in gameplay that allows for numerous playthroughs with new paths to explore each time.

Gameplay Excellence: The game reinstates the franchise among the top titles in the genre, akin to the acclaim received by its first and second installments. Its replayability is a testament to its depth, providing fresh experiences with every new journey.

Rich Universe and Storytelling: The universe and storytelling are robust, drawing on the historical foundations laid by Jagged Alliance 1, weaving references from Deadly Games, Unfinished Business, the island of Metavira, and the expansive world of Jagged Alliance 2. The narrative is solid, offering a seamless integration of the series' lore.

Graphic and Atmospheric Quality: The graphical quality and atmosphere are exceptional. The scenes are captivating, maintaining suspense throughout the game and enhancing the overall experience.

Character Development: Characters are very well-developed, featuring unique interactions, rich dialogues, and spontaneous responses. They are both entertaining and interesting, adding depth to the gameplay.

Gameplay Mechanics: The gameplay is flawless, meeting and even exceeding expectations. It's remarkable that the game can be comfortably played with either keyboard + mouse or a controller in a cross-platform co-op setting.

Bug-Free Experience: I didn't encounter a single bug, though I'm aware some issues were reported but have been promptly addressed.

Co-op Gameplay: The co-op gameplay is captivating and adds an incredibly fun and interesting layer to the game. It's undoubtedly a standout feature.

Value for Money: Jagged Alliance 3 is worth every penny. Its replayability ensures that you can revisit the game time and again without repeating scenarios.

Went in with two mercs with RPGs that blasted out the MG nest and then sent others in with shothguns loaded with breacher ammo and shaped charges while marksmen with M24 and PSG1 loaded with 7.62 NATO Match ammo covered them.

The campaign isn't bad either. It's also flexible in how it lets you approach your goals and doesn't get too tedious. It's nice to be able to auto-resolve battles on maps you've already played.

It really brought back all the old memories, I still remember searching for cows on the fields and punching them just to level up my character's strength, one of the silly hacks in JA2.

Turn-based games have been my favorite, I have played wasteland 2 & 3, XCOM series and etc but JA is still my favorite (220+hrs and still clocking). I have been playing JA since the first series. 

JA 3 managed to retain many of the familiar game elements from JA2 while introducing a brand new game play. 
You get to kill all kinds of enemies now, zombies, Mad Max wannabes, universal soldiers, communists, cultists, wild animals and even innocents civilians if you are feeling nasty. The new game mechanism is much better than JA2, and I love the new stealth kill. The unique skills/talent of your merc makes the game play even more enjoyable.

I can't understand why would someone give a thumbs down rating to the game. Maybe that's because they do not know how to play the game.

My only beef with this game is the absence of many old characters... If you find my nick familiar, Skitz is one of the original and classic character from the old JA 1.

For a title that is grounded in reality (no fantasy elements, magic, etc..), it has a surprising number of gameplay systems that take quite some time to learn. From inventory management to gear deterioration, the entire game is an economy in which you won't want to waste a second. Time is your most precious resource here.

This title was unique in that it offered a warning during difficulty selection - stating that the game was designed to be extremely challenging even on the lowest difficulty. I opted for that route despite typically choosing ""Normal"" on turn-based games. The balance was a bit frustrating because overall, combat and resource management were too easy. The only time I felt challenged was the very beginning when starting money was tight. After capturing my first diamond mine, I never had trouble with money again. So I think the difficulty needs some tweaking in terms of more starting cash at each difficulty level. That will help level out the inverse relationship between the lack of resources and easy combat.

The gameplay is solid and I can honestly say I didn't ever get bored with it, specifically. The limb-centric targeting system and lack of enemy health bars really do make for a more immersive experience where risk vs. reward is everything. The strategy elements in the tile-based map took some getting used to and were ultimately a bit too simplistic but I imagine higher difficulties might make that more engaging. 

In summary, JA3 is a surprisingly complex turn-based experience. It gave me that same sense of immersion that I always crave from turn-based games and despite overstaying it's welcome just a bit in terms of length, I had a great time with it.",1706992640,1706992640,True,4,0,0.547139823436737061,0,True,False,False

Simply put, the enemies typically have the upper hand despite careful planning and strategy.  For example, I placed two snipers on a cliff overlooking an enemy encampment.  Both snipers  were laying flat on the ground under brush that made them invisible, or so I thought. Turns out the enemy could easily nail them despite being 25-30' feet away and 20-25 below my snipers, in a sandstorm no less. Keep in mind the enemy bullets would have to go though the side of the cliff to even come close.  Grenades are also a pain to use. Don't bother trying to make the perfect throw when the game tells you there is a moderate chance the grenade can go astray.  It's extremely frustrating when your explosive expert (or other member of your team) suddenly develops an arm cramp and the grenade in thrown way off course,  Worse yet, every time you throw a grenade you're left in the standing position, thereby requiring you to burn AP to return to your original position (behind cover). The RNR mechanic is also an annoying feature, whereby your team needs ""down time"" to party or they'll develop an attitude. 
Nothing worse than having a member of your squad simply give up in the heat of battle because of poor morale.  Doesn't matter how much health they have, they simply give up and play dead.  This is my first JA game so  maybe the design decisions are familiar to fans of the franchise. Bottom line is that the game isn't so much strategy, but rather dumb luck to succeed.

[b]Like:[/b]
- Characters, dialogues, personalities. These are as great as in original. The one-liners are fun but never go too deep into parody even for weirder characters. Love it.
- Setting, enemy factions - they are fun and new and not a re-hash of the same Arulco enemies as in previous ""games"".
- Interface is neat, I also like the inventory management.
- I like the turn based system with many action points. I prefer it to XCOM 2 action points, definitely. It was updated masterfully for the modern standards. 

[b]Don't like:[/b]
- I would prefer the enemies to be (much) more aggressive on the strategy level. A lot of fun of original JA2 on Hard was to run (or helicopter) around defending towns in different parts of the map, training militia,etc. Here enemy raids are very rare, you barely need to defend (with some scripted exceptions, e.g. the refugee camp, wink-wink)
- The enemies don't care about the mustard grenades that much. They will routinely ruin through the cloud and start choking. This is weird and needs to be fixed.
- Enemies are also way too suicidal. Even an Almost Dead enemy will continue attacking instead of hiding or running away. Sometimes I think I am fighting robots instead of live enemies. I would definitely prefer less determined enemies, especially among lower tier enemies.
- I would prefer that enemies lose more accuracy when they are hit during the previous turn. I really liked how in JA2 five severely wounded enemies were much less dangerous than 2 healthy ones.

Eg. m16 snipe dmg is 16 unless critical else no matter how u shoot it will always deal 16 damage disregard of range,height or even where u hit.(yes head included) 
-can you believe i spray uzi at close range the damage is same as snipe from far? who the F can survive a spray at 3 cm range all at heads? JA 3 can.
-unlike JA 2 u have to fight the battle JA 3 is more of a ninja game commando games. where u stealth kill troops more frequent then a real battle.
-JA 2 if u fully trained the militia u can get a pretty fortified town cause of soldier amount this game in mid game after chemical attack you can't defend any place with all trained militia cause enemy is sort of stronger and will over run all your place if you did not defend your self.

4.) Some of the mods are great.  I wouldn't recommend them all for balancing the game.  Overtime, and with developer support, This game is going to really shine.
5.)  Biggest complaint,  The AI isn't great in some fights mid to late game when you get longer range and stronger weapons.  On higher difficulty the game can be brutal.

It's a good game, I like it but there's a few things that need additional features or fine tuning.
Notably the stealth, real time stealth simply does not work if the enemies are moving around everywhere with no active pause system.
This leads to moments where you you miss an attack or grenade throw due to other timings like animation wind ups.
Haeminmont Games should really incorporate that into the game, maybe you felt that will make it too easy but at the same time stealth turns into extended waiting game and requires much more trail and error than it needs to.",1689440067,1706111041,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

BUT WAIT. 

I'm going to spend some time watching YT reviews and see if maybe I can determine ... the BIG, major thing that I'm doing wrong. Maybe you have to tell the characters to shoot to hit or maybe the player has to some how aim the weapon from the keyboard? Bottom-line: You'll miss enemy across the street, directly in front of you while they'll hit you from across the map while you're in partial cover. Don't even try going to a roof. You see they (enemy) can shoot through the ceiling but it appears that you exist on a single plane ... can't shoot down.

I sat down to play, take time and enough a turn-based game. Now I'm just pissed.

However looks aside, combat is bugged imo - mercs with a high marksmanship skill can't hit a barn door point blank (someone with no cover at point blank range), repeatedly.  The same same goes for knives - seriously I had someone behind an enemy and somehow missed twice in a row, in the same turn. There is no real life comparable. They really are inept and this is despite the now seemingly just marks on paper, stats. How a marksmanship of 90/100 means you can't hit at point blank I'll never know.

So, your guys are basically inept. With the enemy no such reality exists - these, whilst generally equally useless decide to break the deadlock and critically hit two people using pistols, in the dark, with no light sources nearby, with my people behind heavy cover.  Yeah, its like playing multiplayer against someone who's cheating.

One of the features is overwatch, and much like the genre its a case of watching an area for movement and opening fire when they do. So what happens - the solitary enemy numerous times walked around it, as if he knew exactly where it was. Again like playing against a cheat.

Another guy teleporting across the map into heavy cover (the guy who I missed knifing - all of a sudden he was not there - no-one had the action points for a move so great - and if it was someone else then the original guy must have been vaporised, without any trace).

Whats even more bizarre is that you cannot check a dead enemies inventory for dropped ammo/weaponry - do I have to ask which century this game was written in? Basically upon death their possessions vanish into thin air.

All of this was in one mission - I don't want to see the rest of the game - basically the game its very dated, and the weird combat is unforgiveable.

I haven't played JA in ages so after i read some reviews i decided to buy it full price to give it a chance, and i was not disappointed in the slightest. This game is proof that when you love a franchise/game and you put time into it, it grows into a gem (hopefully not a hidden one).
-Story: I found the story really interesting and engaging, the writing was really good and most of the voice acting is top notch.
It offers multiple endings, depending on choices you make during the game and they are lots of them. The banter between mercs are most of the times funny, with some exceptions. I've only tried around 10 or so mercs but the amount of dialog the devs put in is crazy.
-World: I like the map design, has some variety without being too outlandish (with a few exceptions), it's big enough to explore but not boring, like 85% of the sectors have some story or something interesting in them, really careful design which i really respect the effort made by the devs.
Gameplay: I think the gameplay aspect truly shines in this game, if you like turn-based tactic squad games like x-com, ja3 is right up there with the best of them. It didn't feel clunky, animations went smoothly and in my current 52hour of playing it i haven't encountered a single bug. Amazing work!
Performance: I'm using a high end gaming pc, game run perfect with no issues.
Sound: I'm an avid fan of soundtrack in games, music was eh, not bad, not good either, if they were going for something not distracting they nailed it. Sound design was really good though, from guns, to stuff in the game world.

Final Verdict: A must-buy for Turn based tactic fans, it's also worth buying if you are not a fan. It's fun, engaging and respects your time. Amazing work people!",1705450625,1705450625,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Your main character and the NPC mercs you hire improve their skills over time by learning-by-doing, upgrade magazines and training. It iterates on the older franchise with better graphics, more contemporary cliches and quality-of-life features. The map is fairly large.  There are multiple difficulty settings. The need for money, at least early on, motivates you to keep moving forward without resting on your laurels, and even half-way through the game there are some events that crank up the difficulty suddenly when you just begin to think you'll slowly grind your way to victory. The comments between the various NPCs are clever. There is even a small modding community. I haven't played multi-player.

I've just suffered a massive barrage of sleeping gas, mustard gas and the like, and am now having to shift my tactics again. Sniping is out. Gas masks, MGs and grenade assaults will hopefully carry the day as I restart my last mission. For being 80 hours into a game, I appreciate this kind of novelty.

The squad mechanics, overland travel and larger narrative arc make for an entertaining game. If you liked JA 1 or JA 2, you'll like this. If you liked Fallout 1 or 2, you will probably like this. Same goes for Xenonauts, UFO and the like, though there isn't base-building --- instead you acquire grids/locations, some of which can be garrisoned by militia you train to hold off attackers.

Is the plot, story and dialog somewhat cheesy? Yeah, it is. So were its predecessors. It can be downright hilarious at times, but this isn't an AAA title.

I have to say, this is the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time. The combat is fun, and forces you to think even more tactically than before. Endgame battles with artillery add another component you have to out-maneuver.

The mid-game event was pretty surprising to me, and it was a blast combating that as well.

All in all, it kept me entertained and occupied for the duration of the initial playthrough. I watched the simple ending sequence with pride and accomplishment. And I already know it's not going to be the last time I load this up. Next time I may install some mods, which I've already seen a few interesting ones I may throw in.

I'm no stranger to third person tactical shooters, but I'd take JA3 over any of the other similar games any day.

If you don't get tactical RPGs and action movies and you hate America this game can teach you to forgive yourself and love life again.

This is purely based off the vanilla experience, as I have not yet tried any mods.

Let's first clear the air. Understandably no one really says directly how to play the game right, because spoilers and bad marketing. And if you don't know how to play the game right or for some reason don't want to play the game right because you think you're so much better than the makers of this game, then I do not recommend this game to you at all. Just so we know, this is how you play the game right:


#1. [b] Prepare for the role. You are the DIRECTOR of an epic action series. [/b] You're not a writer nor a producer. Just the director.

That means imposing your will on the stage and getting the scene despite the world's imperfections. Everyday will bring a new challenge. New stunt doubles. A new season finale to work towards. Let your vision of profit, adventure, gratuitous violence and sexual innuendo guide you. It won't be easy, but in the end it will be art.

First thing you'll want to do as director is skim the scripts, unless you want to force this into an improv show. Use game guides for research but don't rely on them. Keep your own plans, notes and save with purpose. Be true to your personal vision. Without it you are lost. Trust no one.


#2. [b] Your actors (mercs) are your connection to the show. If you accept each actor as an imperfect yet beautifully unique snowflake you'll enjoy the game more. [/b] The game eventually gives you up to 15 simultaneous paid actors under your control and several 'free' actors available to recruit via the story. There are probably less than 40 playable characters in the game. There is ONE custom character with limited customization and no voice acting. But you don't complain about your tools. A true artist turns limitations into creative solutions.


#3. [b] Don't be too hard on yourself. [/b] Delete and restart. Save scumm. It's just another take. You're the director. When in doubt, see tip #1.

Only because I know how tough #3 can be on some people, I'll include some free casting advice:
- [spoiler] It will be nearly impossible to plan substantially around the most expensive mercs. Don't count on more than one or two as main characters. But you can definitely afford to bring each of them in for a cameo once in a while. [/spoiler]

- [spoiler] When it comes to cheap actors, Livewire is the best for tactical beginners, optimizers and the impatient. Unfortunately she's the worst actress in the whole bunch. The better actors that are also great for tactical beginners and optimizers are Barry, MD and Fox. [/spoiler]

- [spoiler] On the other hand while cheap and viable enough as main characters, Grunty, Igor and Grizzly are NOT recommended for beginners, optimizers and the impatient directors. [/spoiler]",1704956214,1704956282,True,1,0,0.509433984756469727,0,True,False,False

Some pet peeves though are 

-When walking up stairs it does not show up the second floor automatically. This should be really straightforward to do? You have to manually click a button to see the different floor. This becomes quite irritating in urban areas.

-No button to adjust game speed. Sometimes it does appear when in turn based combat, but then also the game speed in real time mode is faster, which is really really annoying. And the button disappears when in real time mode. Sometimes when fighting with militia, the battle gets really tedious, and fast forwarding that should be easily possible. 

-Some voice lines get kind of irritating and repetitive after a while. 

-Too little inventory space. And there should be a clear inventory stash somewhere where you can put stuff without it disappearing. 

-No camouflage kit?

-No helicopter or airplane like in JA2. 

All of these things should be very easily fixable though. And it makes me wonder why they weren't put in from the start? Probably takes a few afternoons to code together fixes.",1704915473,1704915473,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[additional notes 84 hours later] - this game is BETTER than JA2.  The stories are better, terrain more varied, and I like how there is a unified identity to the people - not just a mishmash like JA2.  Definitely improved overall in just about every way!  Bravo!

Afraid this game is as bad as a Disney Star Wars movie?  Don't be.  It's a direct successor to JA2.   In some ways it's  the very same game you remember from JA 2.  Huge map, too.  Lots to explore.

Some stuff is streamlined, but that's generally a good thing.  No gun stores, though. [Bobby Ray's is back!]  Gotta salvage everything, including crafting your own ammo if you can't scrounge enough (so Barry will be a necessary edition).  The voice acting is enough, probably about the same as JA 2 in regards to mercs' lines.  The story is what you'd expect too, with side quests and a bit of sci-fi/horror thrown in.  Graphics are adequate.  Already used mods on day one.  (to increase ammo drop rates, and to allow crafting stuff to go into the 'squad bag.'  

Plenty of auto-saves, and F5 for quick saves - with F9 for quick load of that save)  You can modify weapons only in sectors with workshops.  Diamond mines work the same - and yeah, they run out.  

Skill values are the same, but there are perks now.  Some are character specific - like Barry and his party poppers (grenade shape charges), but also, every level, you can unlock them so  you can make  your mercs melee masters, healers, snipers, whatever.   

Mercs reload on their own at the end of battles from the squad bag of ammo, so each merc does not carry a dozen mags.  

Tips:  You need someone with high explosive skill so you can make ammo.
Use single shots and avoid machine guns like the MG42 you might find early on - as it burns ammo faster than Biden prints money.  
You can use a wrench to get the powder out of pipe bombs for more ammo production.  
Hire cheap mercs and take the time to build them up.  I don't know how bad the end game is, but I do know I'm taking my time and I only have so much income.  
A good medic will be necessary to heal, and you'll need someone with a decent lockpick skill - Kalyna is an awesome lockpick and hacker.  
You can scrap excess loot, but do not scrap lockpicks and crowbars.  There are places I can't get open because I've broken too many crowbars - (how do you break a crowbar?).
MG's are really cool for setting up and controlling a sector, but again, they'll burn ammo like crazy.  
Train militia!  
All cars, when hit, explode a turn or two later.  Don't stand next to a burning car!

Complaints - grenades don't knock people over.
I.M.P. profile questions need to have some more funny ones added, and there needs to be more choices of avatars and voices.    
Injuries during combat don't seem to affect AP significantly.  -  So, slowing down or crippling the enemy doesn't work very well.  
You can't build militia at ports, which means the enemy can take them back without a fight.  
No vehicles??  lol.  I figured they'd ad vehicles with this new 21st century tech available for games!
My complaints may not be bad things, mind you, as this is my first playthrough and it might be my complaints are unwarranted.
I don't have any shitty, cheap mercs to use as mules and to run around training militia.  Where's Shank and Hamous when you need them?

Also, the game appears highly modifiable, so I fully expect major and minor changes available to everyone playing.  Bearpit forums still around?

Not only was JA2 full of large open maps in every square of the grid, but the NPCs were dynamic, so you could play it over and over and they wouldn't spawn in the same places, and they coulda been anywhere.

Honestly, without those types of larger open world feeling and dynamic spawning NPC type map grids to play in, this game is no better than the latest few Jagged Alliance games that nobody likes or plays for more than a couple of hours...

Since it's all story driven, and already has the path you can't stray from in the game layed out like it is, there isn't any way this version of the game can even change to be anywhere near as good as JA2 IMO...  So I wasted money on the label of it again...

I tried to play this game 3 times after months between each go of it, and the forced path and tiny areas are just too damn degrading to even keep this game installed any longer on my machine.

If they somehow make an expansion with JA2 type open world areas, without forcing paths, and dynamic spawning NPCs, I would reinstall this game and love it!

I'm not going to hold my breath though, as this is the new direction they obviously chose and put this much effort into...

Tight, intuitive combat allows a variety of approaches, and requires you to vary your tactics to fit the situation. Sometimes you'll be in an open field, surrounded by entrenched enemies, and need to use stealth to get a good position before engaging the enemy. Other times, you'll be trapped in a small basement with a crowd of enemies - one grenade and two eardrums later, you're standing alone in a smoke-filled room.

What really gives this a ton of replayability (in addition to the mod workshop) is the variety of mercs, each of which have their own special trait or ability. The composition of your squad will determine a large part of your playstyle by allowing/disallowing certain abilities or combat types. Some mercs can sneak, some can blow things up (and prevent you from being blown up), some are expert marksmen, others hand-to-hand experts. All of these are not only valid, but necessary for success, especially at higher difficulty levels. Overall, combat is fantastically well-balanced and engaging, and truly relies much more on skill than RNG.

On top of the combat, there's a world map to manage. You need to take settlements, train your own mercs to protect them, take control of diamond mines for income, and intercept enemy shipments and patrols. You'll also need to heal & train your mercs. At lower difficulties, this is pretty easy, but at higher difficulties you'll feel a lot of time pressure & need to plan your attacks more strategically. Your mercs also have abilities that can affect the world map, like reducing training or transportation costs. 

If you're a fan of XCOM, Wasteland, Fallout Tactics, or the original JA games, this one's absolutely worth picking up.",1704643238,1704643238,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has amazing features like different types of armor, different types of ammo, weapon modification and deterioration, wounds, different de-buffs based on which part of the body has been hit, weather conditions, ricochets, perks, different mercenaries classes and many more.

What an utterly contrived and dumb mission--wave after wave of enemies, complete with mortar fire that removed almost all forms of cover in no time.  Time between waves to heal, or even reposition?  Nope.  Oh, and you have to keep Biff alive, who has no issue standing in the middle of the street missing every shot and getting shot to pieces in the meantime.


Meh, I'll go back and play JA2 1.13.  I don't recall much in that game that ever felt like gimmicky gameplay, unlike the above.  Oh, wait, yes I do--the expansion/sequel JA2: Unfinished Business was similarly gimmicky.  So, I guess this isn't that surprising.

I applaud the developer for creating a game that felt like the real McCoy--but missions like the above are poor game design and I cannot endorse the game for that reason.

Revision 1/2/2024:  I've played a whole bunch more of the game.  The meat on the bones of the game are excellent.  Squad combat is terrific, and they largely captured the game play and vision of JA2.   So, I'm giving this a thumbs up, with a major disclaimer.  There are two scripted events that are frankly ridiculous.  The aforementioned Biff mission, and a later one at the Refugee camp are very similar and not really in the spirit of the rest of the game.  If you like ridiculous ambushes, by all means, disregard.  But both events are easy to skip and you can certainly play through the rest of the excellence the game has to offer without doing either.",1690512344,1704252182,True,0,0,0.561843812465667725,0,True,False,False

They must be either delusional or on drugs to think this is worthy of that name. The mercs have been changed, wokeists have been placated (Steroid used to be funny, now he's like a Duke Nukem knock-off).
The game is overly simplistic and it feels like I am playing a mobile game adaptation.

The inventory system offends me. This whole game offends me. The enemies are ridiculous. The combat is dumbed down. The entire game feels like I am playing with big, dumbed down lego blocks instead of the real thing.

The enemies and NPCs act and talk like cartoon characters. You can shoot and stab a guy across a dirt road and nobody on the other side will notice. You can run naked across an opened doorway with enemies inside and they'll act like it didn't happen.

Stealth kills involve you racing the menu system while enemies keep walking around. Your guy is holding a corner and the enemy just turned it? Well, you're going to have to click the attack enemy action, select a body part, adjust aim levels and.. oh too late he saw you and now he ran away because turn mode started. WTF!

The controls... oh man. In real time mode right click is move. In turn based, left click is move. Why? Who did this? Point me to the derp that made that decision and I will show you a person that has no business designing UX.

If you played any of the previous titles you will like this one.  If you have played anything like the Xcom games this is very similar to those, (though I REALLY missed Squadsight on my snipers).

There weren't many cons to this game.  There were a few minor graphical type bugs, but I never had a game crash at all.  There's a few things I'd love to see the devs update, like an option to keep fixing gear until they are all complete.  It's a little annoying to have to keep doing it again and again.

For the most part the game play is pretty steady.  There are 2 serious difficulty spikes though.  Be VERY prepared when you get 'invited' to the refugee camp.  Do a whole bunch of stuff to prepare before you do that one.  The difficulty ramps up significantly at that point. There is no rush to do it quickly. The other thing is when you go into the tunnels the game get's a LOT more challenging.  It's even more aggravating that you can't bring a 2nd squad with you.

One suggestion is to check Bobby Ray's store EVERY time the notice pops up that it is restocked.  Buy every steel rod, chip, and lens that comes up for sale in the Other category.  You will ABSOLUTELY want them later.  One slight beef with the game is how few rods and chips there are to upgrade your weapons. 

Also save the magazines until your specs hit 90, (paper magazines, not gun magazines).  You can train skills up to 90, but at that point the only way to raise them is by actually doing the things, as well as reading the magazines.   Don't waste a precious health magazine to go from 65 to 66,  It is worth FAR more to save it and go from 91 to 92.  The higher the skill, the harder it is to raise.  That's why the magazines are  more important at high levels.

Get at least one merc each with high explosives, mechanics, medical, and absolutely leadership.   Try to get all of them with as high of wisdom as possible.  Have the leadership guy teach leadership to the others, and then they can train everyone after that.  Don't underestimate the value of training your mercs.  Any time you are healing, or fixing gear, someone should be training on something.  And when you get a 2nd and 3rd squad, occasionally bring them all together to let the high value mercs train the newbies on your B and C teams.

Also, don't forget your AIM merc.  He is expensive, but very much worth it.  I went with 75 for the core skills, 85 for Leadership and Wisdom, and nothing in mech, med, or expl.  At the end of the game all of his skills were in the upper 90s or 100, and he had 80 medical, 74 expl, and 55 mech.  I also selected teaching for him as his perk, and it is VERY worth it.  Once he gets a skill ramped up, he can teach that to newer mercs very easily.

I used Memusu's Mine as the dumping ground for all my extra loot that I didn't want to scrap, or have room for.  All the magazines were stored there, along with other junk I felt I might need later.  It's also where I had all deliveries from Bobby Rays go to.

The game was a LOT of fun, and I'll definitely be playing it again.  It took me 73 hours to beat it, and I'm sure there will be many more hours in the future.",1704176434,1704176434,True,8,0,0.615584611892700195,0,True,False,False

I hate basically everything else in the game, including the inventory micromanagement, merc health, exhaustion, equipment repair, being ammo starved, endless enemy squads running around the world, obscure quests that require reading walkthroughs and / or parsing through a bunch of notes / emails in-game, etc. to avoid missing random events. 

So much of this game feels like I have to micro-manage a dying department store in a failing city where no one knows their job, inflation has shoved expenses through the roof, the city government's trying to shut it down with corrupt health inspections, and the locals are all high on bath salts biting employees faces off.

I just want to close the spreadsheet, turn the phone off so I stop getting harassed with notifications, and have a healthy, properly equipped, normally functioning merc squad attacking bases. I think I might chill out on this game for a bit, and circle back with a cheat mod to make all the annoying trash in this game stop getting in my way of enjoying missions.

These issues really didn't become excessive until quite a ways into the game. Once I had to have two squads just to get coverage across the map, these issues became too obnoxious.

The good: I like the wide variety of weapons available and the ability to customize them. Similarly, there are enough mercs available that it is fun to experiment with different lineups and combinations. There are enough unique locations that things never become stale or predictable. The fights are challenging and the environments are well thought out in terms of cover available and the tactical problems presented. 

The bad: If you are playing this for plot or character development, you will be disappointed. I found the story less than compelling, and the same could be said for most of the mercs and NPCs. Most of the mercs have a single trait or facet to their personality, which is constantly emphasized. This one is ""the slut,"" this one is ""the meathead"" etc...

 This was my first time playing the series so I was a little confused at first but it's actually pretty intuitive. You have this overview/sat map where you can navigate the world split into grid zones (like individual rooms/instances), do repairs/healing/training/scouting, pass time, hire mercs, buy equipment, etc. and then you can load the tactical view and freely roam the map. The time is an interesting mechanic though. With a lot of actions, you have to let time pass.

This is the first ""good"" JA game since JA2 (1.13 especially). Everything since then has been basically crap.

It looks like it was done with same engine as Wasteland 3, so the graphics and gameplay are fairly good. A bit limited in some ways, with the smaller sized / limited areas and lootable/useable items being HEAVILY highlighted instead of ""found"". But these are forgivable shortcomings.

The game plays well and there aren't any glaring bad game mechanics that ruin everything else, or allow you to mega-cheese your way through everything. (Would be nice to be able to sell and not scrap captured weapons, though.)

I experienced a few bugs, but nothing game-breaking or more than a minor annoyance.

With the merc selection and combat mechanics and everything else liberally borrowed from JA2, for a fan of the JA series, there is finally something worth spending money on.

Is JA3 quite as good as JA2? Perhaps not. But it is FAR better than any of those cash grab games with the JA name put out over the years by scammers hoping for a quick buck.

But only for the first 1/4th of the game.

After that you realize there's 0 tactics, 0 strategy, and this game was basically made for toddlers.


* They've added so many perks and abilities, (like automatic insta death stealth headshots), that your team of 6 can reliably kill 23 enemies (the most I've ever gotten on a single map, usually its 8 or so) in 2-3 turns. Combat is a joke on hard difficulty. 

They made resource management an irrelevant system since you'll always have much more ammo and items than you'll ever need.

They made pacing retarded, as you get the best items in the entire game, as many as you want, very early into the game (after exploring about 1/8th of the game map). After the very early game it's all padded content, since all the fights will play the same and you'll never find any gear that's better than what you have. Imagine if they did that in MMOs. 

There's no need for any tactics at all. Stealth your group, move it wholly into an enemy blob, and kill them all in a single turn. Each one of your group gets a free ""stealth kill"" when they fire their first shot, and you get the best guns very fast, so that's all combat in the game from early on.

In addition, they nerfed enemy damage so far from JA2 that if a few enemy soldiers survive, you'll still take next to no damage from full automatic salvos that in JA2 would have demolished your team in one go.

i hope in the future, the JA3 game developer can give us better camera works as good as the Launch Trailer.

Producer who made Showcase Trailer is very neat. He use 3D asset of 90's laptop, TV CRT, and even period correct 90's website and it's spam website-advertisement. I love your work.

i played JA1, JA2 when i was a kid, the JA3 is really great gameplay improvement and gives me satisfaction of playing it.
i also played Brigade E5 and 7.62 High Calibre when i was college student, and this JA3's gameplay and graphic are really make me satisfy.

Really beautiful scenery, white sand beach of Ernie island and Savanna island. I love the work of game level designer 3D artist.

i played the ""U-Bahn"" new side quest game scenario. Just another challenge, but It is ok for me.

Unfortunately, the character's 3D model not change it's appearance. 
For example, if i put Night Vision Goggle, the character's 3D model not wearing Night Vision Goggle.
Another example, if i put body armor, legging armor,  the character's 3D model not wearing the armor either.
Only gas mask, and U-Bahn's gas mask gives the appearance to the character's 3D model. 

Unfortunately the gameplay not gives impression of huge impact when i use Night Vision Goggle, on night scene and underground scene. My Merc still the best even they're not using Night Vision Goggle.

Overall i satisfied to JA3.
But for me, Jake solomon's XCOM 2 is still the best Turn Based Strategy game.
I'm not played Ridley Scot's Alien universe of ""Alien: Dark Descent"" game yet, so i cannot compare JA3 with Alien Dark Descent.

i hope the developer make a DLC of new gear and weapons, just like ""JA2 unfinished business"", the new weapons is soo much more.
i hope the developer make a DLC that update the character's 3D model when it wearing armor. 
i hope the developer make a DLC that update the weapon's thumbnail when it got modified.

The game is not perfect but it runs well and plays well.

In this game you lead a bunch of mercenaries through tactical turn based combats to conquer a nation from other bad guys and gals that want to usurp it.

What the game does better than JA2 is mercenary development and mercenary talents. Mercs do gain stats and perks at a reasonable pace.
Another good thing is that cheap mercs are not unplayable trash, yes they are not as awesome but they are playable and when leveled can be molded to be perfect snipers.

Overall pros:
+ tactical turn base combat is done well, cover matters, aiming matters etc
+ enemy AI - it is not the best, but good enough, enemies like snipers and mortars will run away and try to murder you from afar while close range will close in, enemies will also use overwatch
+ game feature quests from the people that you can complete - some of them are bad, in some you get to make some choices, some of them give really nice benefits

Cons:
- AI and placement of defenders is really bad when you try to defend the sector when they are present - they often start far away from enemies and do not close in in help
- Weapon balance is bad or FN-FAL is just to good, using any 5.56 assault rifles is pointless

Played the game only for few minutes and hate it. 
1. There is no tutorial, only a help menu, where I had to read about how to play, actualy spent more time with ""google"" to figure out how to play.
2. Way too many unnecessary controls in the game.
3. And mostly... the loot system is terrible. In previous games a defeated enemy ""dropped"" the gun he was using, with appropriate ammo, in addition to some random loot. Now... the game behaves like some looter shooter with very randomized loot. In the few minutes I defeated a dozen enemies, and only one, who used a handgun, dropped a rifle, with non-fitting ammunition. Sorry thanks but no thanks for that.

The only downsides worth talking about are that yes, a few Mercs you may have expected to reappear in the game are missing and a few others look or sound a bit off. Also you might be mistaken for calling this a difficult game if you don't invest into upgrading your weapons (enemies can be quite brutal sometimes if you don't). Finally, the game does kind of push you to get a balanced group of Mercs early on and it can be a little bit annoying if one or more of the starting Mercs you wanted aren't available...

But other than that, it's a great Turn-Based Strategy game and more importantly: a worthy Jagged Alliance 2 successor. Sure, JA2 might still edge it out gameplay- and content-wise, but other than an outright 1:1 remake this game is about as close to a proper JA2 sequel as we'd ever get. To me it's important they got the core mechanics right, they came up with a reasonably interesting plot and yet it manages to be easy to pick up. There's no real learning curve and there's many ways to play. They put effort into making this a true Jagged Alliance experience and especially Ian Currie helped prove that even in today's age you can make a sequel to a hugely popular old game that set the bar for it's genre so high... and still give fans most of what they want and still be hugely successful. It looks great, it plays great and it does the franchise proud.

But more importantly than me liking this game, I just want to give a huge thanks and shoutout to Haemimont Games for putting in so much effort to make this a good game.

The only semi big complaint I have is that the economics seem out of whack, and it's too easy to flood yourself with money after establishing yourself on the mainland.  However, it's nowhere close to being a dealbreaker as I just see it as a missed opportunity to create more tension with that mechanic.

Positive:
- good design of environment
- graphic and sound match the need of such a game and are up to date
- handling the team(s) is quite easy so learn even if you are not familiar with JA3 or have been out of such games for quite some time like me
- the story, as far as I can tell after my playtime, is challenging but also fun to play

negative:
- enemies do hit you much easier than you hit them, even if you are in a better position - this sometimes leads to frustration and a lot of loading of savegames
- making money is not that well explained when you start the game for the first time
- enemy troops wondering around the areas and being faster at some points as you can be, might happen a little to often, even in early stages of the game

It somehow maintains the same magic I felt playing XCOM, while also doing something completely different. Let me elaborate. I have played thousands of hours of XCOM 2, so I will compare this game to that. XCOM does a TON of things right, and I will always love the game for all of the incredible things it does well. It's ability to keep itself fresh with mods and random maps over so many hours is a testament to its success. But there are certain restrictions to the mechanics of XCOM that limits its play. This is the pod mechanic. Specifically, enemies in XCOM react to you when you encounter them randomly through the map, and learning to abuse when and how enemies react to you is key to success at higher difficulties. Jagged Alliance does away with that entirely. Instead, it offers you the ability to ACTUALLY SCOUT, COME UP WITH A PLAN, and then attempt to execute it. There are always multiple ways to slice and dice a problem, no way is right, and because of the way the hiding mechanic works in this game, it makes sense to tactically split up your team as appropriate. Jagged Alliance 3 gives more tactical freedom than XCOM ever did, simply because it did away with the pod system. The upgrades and sheer variety of guns (helped by modders), also FEELS really good. Each gun feels different, and you have to play to its strengths and weaknesses. 

Also the story. Wow. The writing is good, the characters are memorable, the quest lines are fascinating and challenging, and the sheer depth of content here is amazing. This truly was a labor of love. I would buy this game again. It's that good. And they keep on rolling out more content, even months after release!

I've played it exclusively on Steam Deck (runs great, and natural control scheme ready to go).

Graphics: just fine for my taste.  Looks good but runs great, which is just like I like it.

Gameplay: the central gameplay loop is addictive and engaging.  I find the stealth mechanics very well implemented.  Bonus points for not having the entire squad ""go loud"" as soon as one merc is discovered.  There are many viable ways to approach combat - sniper/stealth, melee (is actually viable), full auto machine gun (watch your ammo supply), EXPLOSIVE! (Barry...), and so on.  You can truly customize your favorite tactics, and the merc upgrade system allows for additional fine tuning.

Story: it's engaging enough for me.  There's even a plot twist or two.  Character interactions are great.  Some characters get along with each other, some play off each other, and some can't stand each other.  I love the humor in this game.  (The stereotypical action movie buff merc, the Rambo type, the doctor who thought he was joining Doctors Without Borders but accidentally became a mercenary, the Japanese Cowboy [that's a reference to a Country/Western song, btw])  I just don't get tired of the amusing character lines: ""Wow, a few more hauls like this I and can pay off one tenth of my student loans!""

There are major quests and side quests, and enough difficulty options to satisfy my taste.  As someone who loved the XCOM and X-Com games, and strategy/stealth games in general, this one really scratches an itch.  I'm not directly comparing it to those, but it's up there for me.

I'm on my third play through and the devs just released a patch adding more content (for free)!  This is how it should be done.

The character variety is a serious win. Each merc's personality adds not just strategic diversity but some genuine laughs too. And let’s talk about the environments – they're so richly detailed, I found myself getting lost in them, literally and figuratively.

The game isn't without its hiccups, though. The AI had its moments of, let's say, questionable decisions, which pulled me out of the immersion a bit. And for the hardcore fans, some changes might feel a bit jarring at first.

Variety of maps and multiple ways to play make things interesting.  Experienced JA players will want to crank up the difficulty settings to avoid being awash in more funds than you can spend and clearing maps too easily, especially in the mid and end-game.

There is a mid-game crisis that spawns elite enemy squads all over the map who will quickly capture many of your resources.  Don't ragequit - most of those squads remain stationary after they reach their objective and you can retake territory at your leisure.  For the most part the game is pretty flexible about pace - except one timed mission that I recall, for the most part you do not need to rush to take objectives.

As in the past JA titles there is a lot of flavor in the background story and the environments.  Personally I got a kick out of the banter from and between the mercs.  Depending which combinations you choose to recruit and place on the same team they will sometimes engage in funny and unique dialogue, e.g. when Larry gets into Steroid's ""vitamins"".  Some players may find certain mercs personality flaws and repetitive comments grating;  solution to this problem is to instruct the troublesome merc to go perform a dental inspection on a crocodile and then hire a replacement.

Some compromises made to favor gameplay over realism but I think those choices were acceptable.  This is a game after all, not a simulation.

I was able to play all the way through with Intel integrated graphics on a machine with a reasonably stout CPU.  The non-combat real-time movements (stealth approaches) were a little bit laggy, but once turn based combat started this was a non-issue.  Graphics quality was a little bit compromised of course but the game was still fun.  Kudos to the developers for accommodating folks with sub-par PCs.

I appreciate the effort that the developers put into this game, but still, it feels like a primitive or a mobile version of a JA game. The inventory is just a tragedy, a pre-alpha/developer version, there are no basic features like sorting or visible equipment, and overall the design choice is poor and the inventory size is based on strength, do you know how it works? Every 5 points above 50 add you ONE cell, I believe that every single point below or above 50 should count, instead, I think it would be better if inventory was implemented like a mix of Tarkor/DayZ/old JA games - backpacks, tactical rigs, pants, and armor add you slots or weight, special slots for night vision goggles and so on.

Modding, yeah, you can add a million guns and/or mercs, but it won't significantly make the game better because the game core is oversimplified.

The game play is great. You can set up support by fire positions, sneak flanking units into position, snipe, assassinate and scout before ever entering turn based mode, which helps a lot to keep the pace moving.

While I enjoyed the dialog and characters, I honestly skipped most side quests. Towards the end I had the opportunity to complete all objectives, but chose not too. I feel the 50ish hours I played was perhaps 5 hours over what I'd have felt was perfect, still, many of the maps are unique and make for a challenge. You can also kill any named characters, good times.

The power curve is perhaps another issue. Personally, I was able to wipe the enemies from about the 20 hour mark and forward. Let me just submit that the level-action .44 carbine is far too OP.

combat and weapon modding is better.
environment being destructible is way better.
Characters are more comical than in JA2 but they do give out some funny lines, Steroid is still funny.
Militia training is not as good.
Ingame quests and dialog are more indepth compared to JA2.
world and setting are satisfying to play and beautiful.
Now with the gun store i think it feels like the 2023 version of the legendary JA2 but with added humor which may not be for everyone but they rest of the improvements more than compensate for that and create a Jagged alliance experience.

As for things i'd love to see improved.
I'd have preferred it to have less humor and jokes and the game to be a bit more serious (but not truly serious.
Also militia defense sucks cos enemy comes in a blob while the militia is scattered throughout the map and only 1/3 of it engages the full size of the enemy force, this is fixed if you do auto resolve.

The game resembles what would happen if Call of Duty had a baby with Balder's Gate 3. You play as the commander of squadrons like in XCOM but the mercs you hire actually have a personality and interact with eachother in interesting and unique ways.
Choices matter, albeit not a whole lot but at least more than Starfield, but not as much as BG3.

40 hours in and my adventure is over; I think I had a hand in most, if not all the side quests. The game does NOT hold your hand. It has a encyclopedia about the general game play, but THAT IS IT for a tutorial for the game. I didn't even realize you could hire a custom Merc until the last 90% of the game. Infact, I feel like the first play-through of the story mode itself was kind of like the tutorial. Next time I will be choosing hard mode and Ironman mode. Unlike other tactical strategy game, making a single wrong decision as to what to do with your Merc can not only endanger his life, but the lives of everyone else on the team and therefore the entire run through.

You cannot flatten the pitch to view the depth of field in any increment, none whatsoever. I expected better. I have no choice but to thumb down this game based on that. Also:
-No chance to hit indicator. I didn't think that would be an issue until in practice I noticed sometimes it was visually difficult to ascertain line of sight.
-Maps are too small.
-bugged quests and its story continuity. 
-Armor and clothing is not visually represented on your character's 3D model, or 2D character 
-Tool tips and UI text visually blocks aiming at the selected target.
-Real life weapon balance? The enemy brings knives to a gunfight and wins.
-Can't sell weapons you scrounge. Carry a bunch of rifles but whatyado with them? 
-No player controlled militia, or player armed militia
-Rifle ammo is very scarce to scrounge. Gun powder is rarer than ammunition. 
-Tedious system to maintain and supply squads
-Incorrect ammunition calibers versus real life weapons.
-Weapon attachments cannot be removed. Crafting materials for new attachments are rare.
-Unnecessarily difficult to coordinate movement of multiple squads to travel together
-No pause to set up a battle if undetected in real time.
-Forget replayability. Each individual sector is tightly scripted. Same encounter. Same place.

There is something remarkably tongue in cheek yet down to earth about a group of mercs fighting to overthrow dictatorships... With alien nests waiting to pounce on you in mines... That's JA for you.

Sadly this isn't JA2. But nor can it be. Technology and programming have advanced beyond what JA2 could achieve that the next instalment would, by necessity, have to reinvent JA for the modern gamer and recapture that lightening in a bottle.

At this time I'm uncertain if JA3 is what the JA community hope it will be, but there bones are there and only by continuing to play through it will the answer be revealed. So far I'm having fun, but I couldn't say I'm engaged as certain maps and enemy encounters have some issues that will need to be addressed.

Case in point... In one mission you go to find a person and have to endure waves of enemies. This felt wrong in the playing as JA2 and till then, JA3 did not use enemy waves. You fought what was on the map and that was that. The game did not prepare the player for this new style of play in JA and since overcoming it, waves have not been used since. This lack of preparing the player for what JA will throw at you is a consequence of not having game manuals like JA2 provided... But as stated, this is a modern game for a modern audience and it has been streamlined for the modern audience. Interactions are now simplified though the gunplay mechanics and stealth option has become easier to handle once you learn how to use the UI.

If you love Jagged Alliance and want to play this game, prepare for a learning curve. Other than that, much of JA of old has come through to this game. My only major gripe is the NPC's and the lack of engagement you will feel for them. None really spring out despite the creators trying to inject the world with characters... And since the game operates a living world the characters you like might wind up dead because you didn't complete a mission in time... because you didn't know the mission existed.

I learned about the series in 2021, while going through my father's old CD's. Curious, I asked him about it, and he introduced me to what quickly became one of my favorite games - the gameplay was very much reminiscent of Chaos Gate - one of my favorite games at the time. The characters, however, were much more interesting, being memorable mercs, unlike the faceless space marines of chaos gate.

We played together for quite a while, him enjoying memories of one of his old favorite games, me learning at the same time. Of course, JA2 didn't have multiplayer, but one can still enjoy playing the same game at the same time in the same room.

However, earlier this year I learned of Jagged alliance 3. I picked it up on sale this week, and have been enjoying it immensely. Steam hasn't logged the majority of my hours for some reason, probably because I was offline (no student internet in the library on campus) but in about 20 hours of gameplay, Jagged Alliance 3 has captured everything I loved about 2, and then added yet more on top.

Even better, it has Co-op Multiplayer - I know exactly what I'll be giving my father for Christmas.

The difficult, but not impossible, turn based campaign, the story of some guy hiring mercs to take over a country from the greatest of all evils - the french - and the hilarious dialogue make one of the greatest games I've ever played. The coveted ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" is absolutely well deserved, and I can't wait come next month when I can bring my father into the beautiful Grand-Chien with me.

I don't want to sound like an old geezer, but getting a new game felt heavily different back in the days. Better or worse? Doesn't matter. What matters is that it was different. Nowadays you know exactly what you're getting long before you start playing. Gameplay videos on YouTube, previews, bloggers... Also, let's just admit it – most of the time nowadays we just get more of the same. Indies? Sure. But still, most of the time you know [i]exactly[/i] what to expect. Back in the days? It was entirely different story. Picking up another one of those beautiful big boxes was very Forrest Gump experience. You never knew what's inside. Especially since rules weren't written in stone yet and making a game was often more like experiment for its makers. And for consumers? There was sure certain magic in all that.

I still remember the day when I launched Jagged Alliance for the first time. The moment I found myself in a small house with boarded window and laptop on table. Nothing happened. Nobody tried to shoot me, or eat me or kill me any other way, like in the other games. It was just an empty room with a dim light and that laptop. Naturally, with nothing else to do, I turned it on and... my life was never the same since then.

Long story short, JA was a game about mercenaries. We had a big open world island, which some greedy a-hole turned into his own personal fortress, and, well, we were supposed to take it back. By force. To do that, we needed to hire some badasses. And when I say hire? I mean exactly that. Hire. Your guys didn't fight for you because they liked you or shared your views. Those were mercenaries. You got money? You got firepower. No money? You know how it is. That's JA for ya. What's even more interesting – those mercenaries weren't just faceless units that died for us in King's Bounty, Battle Isle and the others. Mercenaries in JA had [i]personalities[/i]. Sure, they had different specializations, but they also had different origins, different backstories and even their own unique way to talk. And it felt... [i]awesome![/i]

Time passed. Good ol' DOS was replaced by Windows. And, naturally, a new JA came out. The one that majority considers to be the very best one out there. And I can clearly see why, since tactical part became much more detailed and cool. Personally, I was a little bit disappointed, since I wanted strategic element to be seriously enhanced too (the game is divided between two screens – so-called tactical mode, in which you fight and do things with your mercs, and satellite view, which is pretty much interactive world map), but still, JA2 was an icon.

Unfortunately, soon after that the nightmare began. Sir-Tech, who acquired the original creators, went bankrupt and... Let's just say that at that unfortunate moment the series started to look like a young lady who made some really bad choices. It all started when Strategy First (who ended up with the rights), decided to re-create JA2 in 3D. They contacted GFI. GFI promised them a game and hired russian studio MiST Land, who, at the moment, already made a couple of shockingly rough tactical games for 'em. Thankfully, [i]that[/i] JA3 didn't happen. The development process was so messy that at some point MiST Land even announced that their game will take place in real time. Without even asking SF. Naturally, those didn't like that (after all, turn-based combat was always considered as series' selling feature), which led to a pretty long sh*tstorm. After which license was revoked. GFI still released the game (which became turn-based again) under the name Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge, but since it was pretty bad and didn't have any connections to JA, nobody cared. All that mattered was that JA3 didn't happen. A lot of publishers asked to produce it. Some actually tried. Nobody succeed. The license moved from one to another until bitComposer decided to (shocker) remake JA2 in 3D. What a fresh idea, huh?

What's funny is that the result was JA: Back in Action. Which was a real-time game. From creators of worldwide Wii hits Crazy Chicken Tales and Fit & Fun. Good Lord... To be fair, though, Back in Action wasn't unplayable. It just... didn't feel like JA at all and had that certain “too much ambitions” aftertaste. You played games like The Fall: Last Days of Gaia? You know exactly what I'm talking about. That and lack of JA feeling led to a very poor reception. bitComposer desperately tried to get at least some income from the name, but no, I refuse to talk about JA Online. Because there's no lower point than browser game. JA: Flashback, on the other hand, is worth mentioning. Just because it was yet another desperate attempt to re-create good ol' JA in 3D. Guess what? It failed too. This time because of Kickstarter and all of the problems with such projects. There was also JA: Rage!, but it's barely worth mentioning because, despite introducing survival elements, it was way too cheap and way too limited.

What's important here is for you to notice the pattern. Now and then, somebody comes and say “Hey, guys! We're going to re-created JA2 in 3D!”. Guess, you won't be surprised to hear that here comes another attempt? This time from Haemimont Games. And it actually does make sense, since it was them who refreshed Tropico series for the new audience. The guys sure knew a thing or two about making peace between old and new schools, so... Yeah. Let's take a look at their attempt.

You know what? The f*ckers did it. They actually did it. OMGWTF how many years later, we actually got ourselves JA2 re-created in 3D. With both views, advanced tactical combat, blackjack and... [i]stuff[/i]. Yay! Yay! … Wait just a minute. What? JA2? In 2023? What the fork? Unfortunately, that's exactly the problem with what we have here. JA3 doesn't look like a brand new game. Instead, it feels like something that was lost and found years later. While playing it, I felt a lot like playing Age of Pirates: Captain Blood. Like, “Wow, that's cool! Must be cool to actually get it the year we were supposed to...” By no means JA3 is a bad game. Everything you like about the series is here and it actually works. For a change. The problem is, aside from much more optional goals, non-linear ending, gamepad-oriented UI from Firaxis' XCOM and some minor additions, we've already seen all that. 24 years ago. JA3 comes with similar map that looks small by modern standards, locations are rather empty and often have nothing but scrap for weapon upgrades, etc. Should I say that it feels disappointing?

What I really disliked, though, is the atmosphere. Sure, the first two games look pretty comical nowadays. You know how it is. Video games became way more serious. Just try to compare Wolfenstein 3D with the latest installments and you'll see what I mean. Unfortunately, instead of re-introducing us to A.I.M., Haemimont decided to turn it into a joke. And it feels... bad. Just imagine the new Hitman game making dad jokes about 47 being bald. It's that bad. Seriously, guys, we've got ourselves a bloody Karen meme here! In other words, Jar Jar is strong with this one and, while being a pretty solid gameplay-wise, this game doesn't feel anything like the original.

Still, knowing that after such a long constipation the series was finally able to take a dump is good. Sure, JA3 doesn't provide us with anything really new and feels more like third-party remake than a real sequel. Can't argue with that. But still, it's a start. From here? The series can finally start moving forward. And for the very first time since forever, the future looks bright. I just hope that we'll get the original atmosphere back. Because, spoiler alert, Haemimont, Jagged Alliance was not Tropico and, while having some puns, focused on something entirely different. On the atmosphere of deadly games, which, unfortunately, isn't present here. Dixi.",1701030583,1701134254,True,49,3,0.752994656562805176,0,True,False,False

This is the proper successor and revival of Jagged Alliance 2, properly modernized without losing what makes it unique, without turning it into an X-COM 2 clone that is something that plagues the entire genre in modern times, while it does takes some inspiration from it to bring it to modern times such as the movement system and skill using movement units, it maintains stuff from the original that it makes it a category of its own such as the AP system to shoot and the fairly deep ammo system and giving weapons a niche of their own that prevents the issue the original had of end game everyone using sniper rifles and with a closer focus on managing the guerilla teams to defend interest points, quests that help you get loyalty with towns and gain newer weapons, a reworked loot system that while does make the early game somewhat hard with a lack of stores, makes you see your weapons less as a stepping stone and more as a valuable asset. and somethign characteristic of the series the management of the team, while it got toned down to a point from previous entries (such as not caring to a point of nationalities/gender/ethnicity), some mercs have still have some standards to work in a team for you, form stuff that is as simple as no newbies or if you have many of of the opposite gender to outright not working for you if you have acertain merc or if you have a reputation of killing a lot of them fast or kill theri friend, but now they can learn to like some mercs and befriend them which helps with their salaries and morale and become friends that helps with their morale which is what makes the game more unique, your virtual dudes and dudettes are just not some random char made from bits n ends but more unique and charming that range from the typical soldiers and guerrilla leaders staple for the genre to stuff as memorable as a religious bomber to a cowardly doctor that's working to deal with his student loans which gives the game so much soul and charm.

Something that was rather surprising was the tone of the game while it does take itself seriously it can get campy in such a charming way like the old Jagged Alliance 1 & 2 without making it like the ton of pretentious revivals/clones/homages there are in the steam store, while it does have easter eggs calling back t o previous entries (internet ads to vacation on arulco) other agencies and old characters from the first two entries without coming as fanservice for the sake of it and more as making a rather rich world, with lot of 80s references that go from simple posters to lines.

PROS:
1) It is old, good JA. It is not broken like many old good games newly released with ""consecutive number"" in a title. The biggest advantage. Huge. That should be enough but...
CONS:
1) No weapons online store. Some people scattered across a map, selling single pieces of weaponry are placed here and there. Really? Mercenaries trying to conquer small states are beggars looking for firearms and ammo in bushes? OMG...
2) ...but some of those mercs without ammo and guns can... create thermal sights, rifle scopes, red dots and other advanced technical equipment from junk. Yes, they can! No advanced factories, tools, equipment. Hokey-pokey - ready! But they can not manufacture a pistol. Okkkeeeyyyy... :-D BTW: thermal sights do not need an illuminator - correct it please.
3) Diamond mines are losing efficiency as soon as they are conquered. Yeah, thanks. Sooooo realistic and fun.
4) Enemies are... super tough. One guy received a 3x 9x19mm burst in the head, later a 3x 5,56x45mm burst again and... was still running, shooting and trying to kill my mercs. Awesome! Better ones can get several hits in a head with carbine ammo without effect. I know - it is a game. But please... a little bit of realism. Damage of firearms using pistol ammo (9x19) or assault rifle ammo (5,56x45) is 6-10 when an ordinary enemy has 50-70 HP. Firearms are not ASG, people!
Until there would be a change in above issues - thumb down.

[h2]No previsou JA-franchise experience:[/h2]
If you have no past experience with the JA franchise so far (especially JA and JA2) I would recomend watching a couple of the newer let's plays (really go for the newer, as the patches up to 1.3 (so far) have addressed many of things, that did not resonate to well with audience).

[h2]If you have some experience:[/h2]
Whether JA3 will be a satifactory entry for you will highly depend on your expectations, and which aspects of the past titels appealed the most to you.

If you expect a more modern JA2 on a level of the 1.13-mod: You probably will be deeply disapointed.
If you are expecting a more modern JA2 vanilla experience, this game may very well be your cup of tea.

Quite a few things have been either streamlined or ""gamified"".
This really helped to speed up everything within this game compared to JA2 - but it might take away an aspect, you were really into.

Most noteworthy differences off top of my head:
[list]
[*] JA3 has a much higher ""role playing"" emphasis compared to JA2. They tried to pull something similiar in JA2, but neither was the engine suited for that, nor did they have time to finish this.
In JA3 you partymembers take part in dialogs, and depending on the skill-sets available in the party, dialogs and quest vary a bit. 
[*] No more individual clips you have to carry around, and all ammo is shared in a team-inventory. (but there are still different calibers, and HP and AP variants)
This takes away a bit of the inventory management, but also spares you from the constant inventory-fiddeling after each combat.
[*] The main-UI is ""less helpful"", than even the old JA2. Everything seems to be just one click further away, than necessary. And after 90 hrs of gameplay I find myself still searching the screen for information, that JA2 somehow provided ""in your face""
[*] To balance auto-fire and semi-auto even more (as if ammo-consumtion and accuracy-penalties wouldn't be sufficient) a bullet does less damage, when fires as part of a burst. *shrug*
[*] Taking damage feels less crippeling compared to JA2. Unfortunatly this goes even both ways, and an enemy that is on his last 20% of health is basically as dangerous as a completly healthy one.
[*] No vehicles so far
[*] Tactical maps feel (much) more confined, than in JA2.
[*] Some of the difficulty comes from bullet-sponges. Especially those few bosses fall victim to this. But then again JA2 did something similar with over-armoring enemies.
[*] The overall tonality was a bit more serious in JA2 - but frankly not that much.
[/list]

[h2]Conclusio[/h2]
While I personaly would have liked the game to stick closer to the semi-realistic inventory management of JA2, and also keeping the damage-system closer to JA2, I still have lots of fun with this game.

The characters and their dialog is hilarious in the same sense, as they were in JA and JA2.
The overall tone in JA2 was a tad bit more serious - but not too much.

Graphics are ok. I would even call them quite good.
Animations are fun to watch, albeit a bit repetitive.

The game itself is quite open for modding, as far as I understand.
And for many things, that one might want to be just a bit different, you should be able to find a mod.
However: at the current time the dev team is quite active with updates (which is great in itself) - so mod-stability is a bit of an issue. A mod working today, may not necessarily do so tomorrow.",1701108396,1701108438,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It may not be as robust or indepth as the former game, but that's okay, since Jagged Alliance 3 has much to offer and it suplements simplifications with quality of life improvements. Some maps may be small, however there is a lot of them and all are carefully crafted 3D dioramas with a hefty amount of atmospheric details.

One can argue that there is a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor, maybe too much 80's and 90's action movie cliches, but I didn't have issue with it. It maybe a bit more then what we grew used to, but that's just this game's own spin on things. There are a lot of sidequests in almost every urban location, some choices that affect the campaign further down the line, but also few nasty surprises that come out of nowhere and real F-U moments. Not to spoil a thing, but to ramp up the tension there is an even that the game spawns randomly strike groups that aim for your major hubs and just take them over without any warning, even if you played carefully with mighty-guerilla-warfare strats so that exact thing does not happen!

Jagged Alliance 3 feels and plays like a Jagged Alliance game and is a fun turn-based strategy title with some solid design… and a far cry better then any other recent attempt at the franchise since Unfinished Business. With Haemimont Games adding content and adjusting game mechanics (often according to community feedback), it really feels like my favorite franchise has a future again.

I'm especially impressed by the enemy AI, a single sniper downed my merc in one shot even though he was high up in a tower and crouching. I've also seen opponents utilize explosives effectively. The humor in the game is also classic JA humor and some of the banter and the descriptions made me laugh really hard. The music is also very nice I think and fits the setting of the game very well.

Really nice Modern X-Com style Tactical gameplay with the classic Jagged Alliance personality (surprisingly) maintained!

I'm a big fan of JA2, specially the Unfinished Business version, which was my very first PC game, and playing this now seeing some of those familiar faces bough me back some good memories.
Only downside that stood out for me is there's quite a bit of jank specifically in how stealth works and the transition between the real time gameplay to turn based tactics, which would make me VERY frustrated if I was playing this on Iron Man mode or something. I would advise against trying Iron Man mode (Dead is Dead as they call in this game) solely because of that, it's very easy to slip up and end up in an unfavorable battle condition.

These guys delivered pretty big. We got the characters. We got some stealth. And yes, you can play an entire mission in stealth and kill everyone. Keep practicing if you cant. We have some ambush missions. Quests galore. Open map that lets you play how you want. The right mix of being pissed off and re-loading. The chuckle factor. The starting over because you died. Ran out of money. Made horrible choices. Spread too thin. Oh, and yes - run out of bullets. (That sucked).

The big 2 missing features would be No online shopping and No entering turn based mode outside of combat, there is a mod to add the second. (EDIT) Game now has an official enter turn-based mode outside of combat, and the online shopping HAS BEEN ADDED IN.

And now the review.

When i first started playing this game, i too thought stealth was terrible, then i learnt how it works, nowadays my stealth toon will comfortably clear at least half a map, if i am willing to be patient and take my time they can clear an entire map, that's with a knife.
So i actually feel like stealth mite be a bit too strong in this game, not to mention that if you take advantage of breaking site with the enemies in combat and re-entering stealth, you can abuse them like an unwanted child.

On CTH, I was sceptical, and at first it annoyed me, but now I think its great, i lost some pretty pathetic fights at the beginning, but once i had gotten used to the system i started missing less and less,when playing the game for me the cth sytem gives me a much more organic feeling than what i am used to from games of this genre.
Having said that, I am sure its not for everyone, fortunately the devs provided a mod at launch to give you the standart CTH percentage that most games offer.

The pathing in this game seems.... Pretty average, I have seen worse and I have seen better, not so bad that I would complain, not so good as to deserve any praise.
Although I would like to note that I have only set of one mine in all of my playtime, which for me is nothing short of a miracle, normally my people be having no legs.

Performance - I have experienced the occasional frame rate drop, usually lasting 5 to 10 seconds. Maybe happened 4 or 5 times in 60+ hours. my pc is comfortably above the minimum required specs but well below the recommended. otherwise its been a mostly smooth experience.

Injuries/debuffs - the standard debuffs from attacking body parts is underwhelming, you can take a perk to increase the effects from hitting body parts, but even than they feel underwhelming, especially considering the point investment required to unlock that perk. Honestly, if there is one part of this game that i feel is a let down, it is how underwhelming these injury/debuffs are. Personally I would love to see limbs flying everywhere like in Kenshi

Strategy and Tactics - Honestly I am not really sure what people are talking about in regards to being forced to play a certain way, especially in regards to the use of overwatch. I have used overwatch maybe 3 to 5 times in total, in my current playthrough on the highest difficulty, i have not used it at all, i seldom use explosives.
In this game, the tactics and strategy i use generally focus around stealth and mobility, mainly using assault rifles and submachine guns, plus the occasional knife throw. Overwatch is more attacks with less accuracy, and no control over aiming those shots, plus you are essentially handing over the initiative to your enemies, nothing about that sounds like a good idea to me, but apparently it is the go-to strategy for some people.
So, clearly we aren't forced to play in any particular way.",1689355987,1700825252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Man, this game. You know, I am one of those ""Gamers"" that is old enough to realise, every franchise destroys itself sometimes. When I grew up in the 90/2000s games like Jagged Alliance 2, final fantasy, command and conquer where just evergreens. 

Thats back in the Day when ""Big Developers"" still hat passion for their Projects. Where they cared about it, rather then just nowadays to generate as much income as possible because every game series we loved gets bought out by some Tripple A megacorp and squeezes every cent out of it. (Member Command and Conquer? Member Mass Effect? I do member and I do member a sad lot more of it).

Jagged Alliance had several tries at relaunching itself wich all Failed. So I was skeptical of this Game right here. I waited and grabed it, when it was discounted for 30€. I was pleasantly suprised to be honest.


[h3] This game is Great! [/h3] 
It has all the stuff, someone who played the older games, would expect. You can do that awesome ""Create your own merc by multiple choice"" again and I had some giggles here and there. Lovely done. The Characters in this game are very well voiced and Interresting. By the End of the Game I had 3 Squads running 6 Characters each and I loved listening to each and everyone of them when they had to tell me something or they had a dialoge option with some NPC. They really did great here (I´ve read somewhere that this is because the original creator of JA1+2 was involved and took care of exactly this).

I downloaded the Demo before purchasing, wich had me worried. I run a rtx2060, ryzen 9 3800x, 32gb ram ddr4 and yet the demo really run not well. But changing to the full version, that worrie where gone since it ran like butter. Great Visuals too. Overall very good optic of the game.


The story might be somewhat generic but I found it very pleasing. It was what I expected. Some 3rd world garbage dump, some political uprises and you being a hired gun in all of that to do what you get paid for. Killing uneducated 3rd world people with some funny 1st world manhunters and psychopaths.

Took me roughly 52 Hours to complete the Campaign while making most (like 90%) of the sidequests. Wich is ok for me, game offers somewhat replayability since there is a Fallout style ending, depending on what you choose in certain quests. I really enjoyed the inventory management and adjusting your gear to your needs. Only downside, there is no real ""shop"" ingame where you can buy stuff for your people. I was constantly low on either Meds for one squad, a certain type of ammo or in the beginning of the Game (wich was honestly annoying at that time) something to break a lock. But as far as I am informed that will be added later in with some patch. Uncool but not gamebreaking. 

Game threw a hefty curveball at me(you the player) roughly after 20 hours in wich some people may not like. I loved it. Cant tell you more since that would be spoiler.


Cant sadly tell anything about the coop since I played it solo (and boy did I alot of savescum) and with 1 active mod the whole time. 


Overall, this game was great Fun, I really had a blast playing it and it was, in my oppion, very well worth the 30 bucks I paid for it.

Thanks for Reading.

Edit: One thing I forgot to mention but that I totaly loved, the games maps are handcrafted and filled with Easter Eggs. KoRn, Mad Max, Fallout, Cthulhu and many more for you to discover. Game just was made and designed with love and passion.

- no sort inventory/sector stash function
- inventory management is garbage (common squad inventory for ammo but with multiple squads this becomes tedious and shitty to manage)
- no force movement key modifier (so you don't accidentally open/close door when you just wanted to move next to it)
- stealth attack and transition to combat (turn-based) from real time has no slow-mo functionality (when you are coordinating multiple characters moving in place etc.)
- cannot move militia between city/town sectors and only limited to 8 militia per sector (no real reason for these)
- weapon implementation is tier based (which is a fucking moronic thing to do) meaning that rifles like AK-47 and FAMAS are early game garbage guns (LOL) and stuff like AK-74 is mid game goodies.
- cannot have pistol in one hand and knife in other (LOL why the fuck not?) but can have pistol and grenade

Maybe with patches and community mods the game can become a polished jewel but right now it is NOT worth the asking price. In it's core implementation the game is only jaggedy alliancy in name only.

After putting in over 80 hours into Jagged Alliance 3, I can safely say that this game is the true inheritor of the Jagged Alliance franchise.

I was extremely skeptical at first, though the more I played, the more I appreciated the brilliance of naming the game Jagged Alliance ""3""; In my opinion, this iteration of the series wipes clean the cash-grab stains of the intermediate titles. As with any sequel, there are a few things that I wish were in the game that are not, and there are a few quality of life improvements that I wish JA3 had, but when looking at it in it's own right, Jagged Alliance 3 is an extremely well made, rewarding, and beautifully rendered game.

There is enough lore, throwback quips and nods to the previous games, and familiar faces to satisfy veteran players of the JA-series, while not overwhelming new players; JA3 is it's own story and it's own adventure, while faithfully incorporating key past game events into it's own canon. The overall voice acting is great, and while sometimes annoying af (I'm looking at you Livewire), they reach a depth of ambiance and immersion that really pulls the player into the game; I have not enjoyed a strategy game as much as I have enjoyed JA3 in many years.

Even I was not a big fan of a 2nd part, mostly because of graphics, (I have a friend though who is crazy about that game) I must admit the gameplay and mechanics, kept me intrigued and interested the whole time. Now this, in my unprofessional opinion, is well worthy successor of 2nd part (JA2). Mercs chit chat is not boring, npc's talk with expression, they do not read their text from page for 10 bucks/h. Animations are nice. The destructions are well worth a Silent Storm engine, even the game is not using it, I been corrected it was the cancelled 2007 version that was going to build on SS engine. On 1070 it works surprisingly well, with few settings lowered from high, almost everywhere it runs near 60 FPS on full HD.

Character cooperation and friendship is here as well, for example I had uncle Ivan and his nephew Igor working together in one squad. They were about ""we're Dolviches, and how Im proud of my nephew"". Also there is interesting dialogs between different squads members, for example a medic from Delta squad (mostly my goods transport and militia training squad) was asking about some medical things of medic from my Charlie (main) squad.

The small details are in there too - Livewire has tablet - it has cute stickers on it, sounds like a feature, but is not, just a ""cosmetics"" detail in words.

One minus so far the equipment is not visible on models - I mean helmets, pants, flak vests. I hope this can be fixed by devs, or by mods. Since characters CAN wear gas masks and they are visible on them, means this is not impossible for devs to do.
Second minus is when I select character with Tab or LMB click, I expect he is ready to move or do something without much more clicking. Nope, to move I have to click him AGAIN. Why this second click, I dunno, don't need it.
Third - crafting of the weapon mods, EVERYTIME on new weapon or on the same weapon when you change one mod with another. I understand, mechanics are so skilled they can craft mod, OK, but you craft them ONCE and then just take from old rifle and attach to new one. Logic is such simple. Why to craft them every time. And scraping the weapon to parts do not drop it's mods, but it should. Weapon mods should be separate part as they were in 7.62, for example.
Fourth - people are complying about strange buying mechanic from merchants - just one thing and per 24 hours. Hm, some weapons closer to endgame are more rare, but that is fine I think, other thing is if you will not be thorough and methodic in your searches, you might not find them. Again, remembering how store was working in Brigade E5 - every item had some tier, and as player has been progressing along those tiers, the new weapons has been opening for him in the merchants stores. This would be good mechanic here as well, I think.

Now main story is simple, President has been taken hostage and you gotta rescue him. Along the way, you will face few intrigues, which will be a game changer for some unprepared players at that moment. Those intrigues are basic, but solid and simple. Other than that as a distraction from main story line there are bunch of events happening in the country: some strange serial killings, or investigation of murder case, treasure hunting in several places of whole map, helping the guerilla to fight the Legion and other more local sector limited events.
It's nice and I would not call them boring.

Finalizing, I have to say, I felt like I'm back in the day when I seen the Brigade E5 for the first time, about 15 years ago. It again feels like it's a game we all have been waiting for so long. Despite some weird aforementioned decisions of developer, JA3 is stands proudly besides with Brigade E5, 7.62, Wasteland 2, even XCOM (from which it is called, borrowed cover shields system, which is only good thing, in my opinion, if it works, then why not)

One of those games, when being near final missions you already thinking how you will play that in new game, with new knowledge.

Devs, well done. Thank You..

However... after the last update there has been some weird stuff happening in game. It's still playable, but not quite so enjoyable anymore. All the more irritating, since I haven't had this problem in the beginning. I hope this will be fixed soon, as for now though, thumbs down :(

Update: I've played for a few hours straight today, and the audio didn't crash at all (it usually happens after some 15 minutes)! It's like I can finally enjoy this game properly again. Soooo glad. Still... the game tends to crash entirely every now then, it and needs to be optimized further. For example it still suffers drastic fps drops at most intense moments (like big explosions, weather effects, or at places with many npcs around). After all though, it seems like the devs are doing a fair job and I hope it stays this way, so that I can soon turn this thumb upwards. I shall keep rest of my fingers crossed till then. Cheers.

To sum up: It took me nearly 120 hours to see the endgame and I feel like replaying it immediately, just to try out another bunch of these misfit characters. This is one thing I like this game for - the characters and voice acting. Another one would be the environment destruction. It's really nice to watch bullets of different calibers impact on various surfaces... ricocheting, penetrating and such. If you look closely enough you can even spot the hot air weaving around the barrel after firing a long burst. Quite impressive. As for the optimization issues I mentioned earlier, it took some mingling with the settings and applying external cooling to my laptop, but it runs in 60fps after all. Still, I think the pathfinding is really bad here. I had a few cases, where the game would flap out entirely after a few dozen npcs simultaneously kicks into a location after shooting all the bad guys for example. After all though, the thumb turns upwards. JA3 provides an excellently balanced and rewarding tactical challenge with many and more memorable characters and I love it :)

Despite the developers delivering on their promises and the game being generally well-reviewed, file this one under ""not for me.""

The game offers a variety of tactical combat decision-making, based in part on unique character selection and the player's preferred tactics. There are machine guns and grenades, snipers and covering fire. Risk is sometimes rewarded and other times punished, inviting the player to take chances--but not too many! My biggest frustration in this domain is the game's insistence on real time movement outside of combat. It was difficult for me to get my characters in to or out of position while enemies actively patrol, and I struggled to stealth effectively. Were I a younger man, I'd likely be up for the challenge, but my slowing reflexes required every mission to become a smash-and-blast affair.

I also had trouble with the game's economy. I liked its intended loop: troops want income for risking life and limb, and the company needs income to keep them employed. But I struggled to find significant sources of income, so I spent a lot of the game barely scraping by, constantly worrying about insolvency. No doubt there are ways to do better--the tutorial might have offered more direction--but as a new player, I was mostly flummoxed. 

Almost as annoying--as has been noted in other reviews--is mission difficulty arising from increasing enemy health pools. ""Bullet sponge"" game play can be fun in limited doses (perhaps fighting a huge beast or a well-armored boss), but if these impenetrable-wall foes are too numerous, the trick loses its charm.

And speaking of charm, Jagged Alliance sets itself apart with humor and setting. The game is set in a late-twentieth century South American nation, a Banana Republic were its major export fruit rather than diamonds. What could've been a dreary engagement with the anti-democratic horrors of the United Fruit Company sponsored coup in Guatemala is instead handled with a wink: Yes, corporate colonialism is terrible. Yes, valuable natural resources engender territorial violence that only harms locals. But at least you're working for the good guys? (Maybe?)

The game's narrative consistently glances to the fourth wall. The writers must want players to make connections between their game world and recent history. These gestures, though, are occasionally too on-the-nose, veering from the arch to the hackneyed. More than once, I felt tired of the story and characters. What was intended as amusing dialogue, banter between the characters, instead became an eye-rolling chore of a listen. (I realize, of course, that humor never works for everyone. I was equally annoyed by the jokes of the well-regarded [i]Borderlands[/i] series. And [i]Scott Pilgrim[/i]. And [i]Everything, Everywhere, etc[/i]. That is, the defect may be in your reviewer.)

There are parts of this game that I very much enjoy. I'm always up for turn-based strategic combat, and I appreciate developing a varied team to complement my playstyle. These features, though, can be equally found in contexts that I far prefer, namely the X-Com and Xenonauts series. (One difference that I did enjoy is JA3's refusal to show players' their hit-chances. No more cursing a 99% chance to hit! Instead, one curses one's bad decision making.)

For once the combat hasn't been dumbed down to the level where you can move and shoot and that's it: it's still not overly complex but there's still a good amount of tactical opportunities to utilise.

To make sure, I replayed JA2 to check if I am idealizing the Past.
I did not.

They tried. Hard. And failed. Hard.

The Gameplay may seem ""ok"" at first glance, but as more as you get into it and understand it - as more it gets bad.
Example: What do you think has the higer probability to hit as well as to deal damage and what costs less AP: 
- A Merc running and shooting 3 Times ar random Targets, using a One-handed MP at 60ft
- A Merc in hiding, Aiming at a stationary Targets Body from 20ft.
Right, it is the running and gunning guy. Costs 6AP and shoots trice a 3-Salvo af which half hits.
Aiming costs 8AP and fails to hit on 3 out of 4 Tries, regulary doing just minor damage if at all.
Can you even shoot 3 Times if not with that Skill? No, not at all. As ""Run and Run"" costs the same as an Attack, but adds 2 Attacks and half your Movement to it.
And while JA2 works pretty much alike Games as ""Door Breakes"" and so, this Game fucks that up entirely. It claims to be ""intuitive"" and such for immersion - but has no consistent Logic to adapt to. It is just learning how to cheese the AI and Exploit - nothing else.
Not to say that NPC act pretty Conterintuitive - up to plain Lemmingtrains into Machine Gun Fire just because you put it in a hrubbery and they ""can not see you"" - while you may attack with a Char and stay concealed, yet all Enemys run instantly towards you and bumrush you.
What triggers that and how to prevent that?
Well, have your Team along with you and have em cover you - also hidden.
Then, AI knows about that ambushzone and flanks.
The AI is a very poor and extremeley un-fun Thing in that Game.

Especially if it comes to Allies and non-aggro NPCs.
Biff for example loves to run from the perfect Cover into the open to maximize the Damage done to him. He even runs through obvious Enemy Controlzones - just to get into the center of a Mortarstike indicated by that Red Circle.
His Char is a ""Coward who lets down his Teammates and deserts them in the Face of Danger"",
Yet, AI makes him run yelling towards them into his very obvious Death - if there are 100 better choices - Biff will take the 101st that sureley kills him.
Just as one example of many.

And the Hit-Chance-difference in NPCs and Players are..... wonky at best.

So, we end up in:
- Tactics do not work, because the Way they work is inconsistent, highly illogical and the Game give close to no indicators what works and why, more than half the Time completeley opposing what one would assume from comparing it to ""how it is in RL and other Games"".
- Ai is a mere Scriptboit that constantly confuses itself, adding to the confusion stemming from the inconsistency and illogic in Balance and Gameplay. Basically, it is a Scriptbot dumber than Skyrim that was fucked up so badly, there is nothing going on aside ""All rush the Front"".
- Hitchances are pretty different just because you are a Player and some Code thinks it would enhance your fun when it makes the Game harder up to a Point it is completeley nonsense.
A 90/90 Sniper with fullmodded Dragunow on 90 ft does not hit the Targets Head 14 Times in a Row while the NPC hits withn his Browning (Handgun) constantly hits for 30 Damage.
- The ""behind the Screen"" Mechanics are fucked up as well. Missions to execute a Action make it harder to do so - again, 14 fails in a row. Multiple Times. Multiple different Games.
Every Run, that Char does HEadshot after Headshot - just to fail historically as soon as the mission pops up.
And that JA2 did not do. At least, not so badly.
- The entire Storyline may seem ""JA-Wonky"" - but is highly illogical in itself - often even contradicting itself, ruining the Immersion it has build up more than finding your Neighbours D in the Popcorn you eat. The difference here is the same as good Satire is compared to PeePeePooPoo-Jokes.
- The composition of the Mercs is stupid to say the least. It is ""One you take"" and the rest is ""red Herrings"". Your Char is bound to be a leader - no freedom at all compared to JA2.
There is just one ""Leader"" and he costs way too much for what he's worth - you buy him for ""necessity"", nothing else.
Special abilities of the lowerst Mercs make them more worthwile than some Elite Mercs - again, Elite does not feel ""Elite"" - it feels like ""Generic Soldier Addons that are already properly Leveled"" - not like in JA2 where they WERE the best and you WANTED them for that, because they were the only ones with High Stats AND Special Abilitys.
- No explanations atr all about the Games Mechanics so one can understand them - no Word about ""Yoiu oughtta get to 150 Combines Attribute&Skill for a simple Task to be succesful"".
""Find out should be the Fun"" - yeah, right. But for that, you need consistency so people can see what you want. But thoose Guys here, they just created a fantasy Language and blame ""thoose who do not get it"". There is onthing you can rely upon as even ""your own Skill"" does not matter and can not be applied properly aside ""finding out how to exploit"" and ""do constant Savescumming"".
""Feeling natural and imersive"" - my Ass.
- The UI is slightly better than JA2 - because it has less Options. Yet, it is more annoying, as oyu expect a better UI as Things as ""User Friendly IUnterfaces"" and ""intuitive UI"" were invented since then.
Spoiler: They did not do so. Even the so-hated X-Com UI is better and more consistent than this shitshow constantly creating misclicks and demanding to make sure you be clear in your click - it feels like the Guy at Work who activeley tries to misunderstand everything said wrong to the utmost possible extend and beyond. The Guy who reacts to ""We have to translate that Book into Mandarin."" with Screaming ""DiD yOU SaY OrANgE?"", jumps on the Deks, kicks your PC Screen away and pulls his Wang out and does the Propeller in your face, caling you ordered it - why else did you say ""The Trans is late, I need a Man. darling"". Thoose Fucks.
That is this UI. Simplified to a Point where it gets up to ""bareley bearable"" to use it.
- Self-sabotaging Storylines. The Storylines do not grant the feeling of achievement - neithe rthe one you finish succesful (against all Odds of the Game sabotaging), not the one failing because of the Game sabotaging your very effort activeley even beyond plain Cheating - because that it would be when you do so. This Game is the Guy who changed Rules whilst playing the Boardgames because he is not ""the best"".
- Stupid enviromental Effects - I do not refer to the natural Effect occur, I refer to the mechanical Effect for the Gameplay.
- 

So, what did that Game good?
Well, the basic Idea is great. The franco-african Setting. The Ideals.
But the making is shit. Like the Idea of a 1000HP Supersportscar that can drive a at full Speed and not loosing Traction is great.
But putting Wooden Squares instead ow Wheels on it does not help - and it does not help that you now put the Transmission downa and the Differetials and traction Contolr up so it does not loose Traction anymore - because it can only go 3mp/h.
The best Suspenders won't compensate for that wooden Square Wheels, the Plastic Frame you did instead of Carbon Fiber, the steam Engine you put in (Hey, it has 1000HP, right) and the horizontally installed Iron Maidens you used as Seats.

So, let that Game have some slack - it is a Jagged Alliance at all, unlike all aside JA and JA2.
But it is the worst JA in that series, only surpassed in shittyness by the ""Ones which Names you do not say"".
To be honest - ""Back in Action"" is more Fun - even though it is a pretty bad remake of JA2.

JA has always been a fav of mine. JA2 was masterful. Very hard act to follow. Had it's flaws (please don't let me look 8 sectors for the pliers). It had some very dark humor. No matter how many times Elliot got slapped, I could never quite feel sympathy for him.

Some great lines. ""What a weird turn of events. Mike's here!"" (thanks Raven!). Kept us knowing we were playing JA, but better. The characters, and skills, and how they interacted, gave the game life. Brilliant idea to introduce M.E.R.C. and all the mercs we never wanted to hire, or did (ahem) or let die (aherm) The interactions were fun. 

JA3. I see it. I want to see it. 

The positives. 

Combat system hasn't changed all that much. Anyone who's played either title will get it quickly. 
Graphics are fun. Not quite as amusing as the death's in JA2, but amusing. 
Streamlining the loot system. Thank you for not making me search every interactive object on the map.
 
A lot of people are going to think I'm insane for this next positive.

I LIKE the ammo system. I DO. I keep hearing ""that is sooo not realisitc, blah blah"". Looked at your squad inventory? all the stupid ammo you carry around that no one uses? Do you have 3 people with Dragunov's, and one RPK? Think you can burn only 60 rounds in 3 minutes in real life? No, of course not. 

I LOVED Bobby Ray's, BUT. Sifting through nine pages of all the ammo I thought I might need, somewhere, at some point, while I couldn't keep my FN-FAL's barrel from falling off....

It was excessive.

The ammo system. Just an idea, it would be better to have had Bobby Joe open first, with extremely limited options, while offering the ammo crafting mechanic as an option to augment poor supply. I'ts believable that most mercenaries are familliar with making their own rounds. But having all the crafting materials in the field? There's the line. You have to stretch some concepts from reality to make a fun game. I think they did well, especiall with the newest addition of Bobby Ray's. 

The negatives.

I summed a lot of this up, above. I like the operation mechanics. There are some well written sidequests. The main quest can be... tedious at times. The maps are smaller than I'd like. The humor is dated, no doubt due to the developement cycle. They sacrificed soooo many mercs that your team choices are almost predetermined. Lack of character interaction amongst the team. 

I still enjoy it and give it a very positive review.

* edit * Got some more time with the game as well as just more time has passed for polish and  patches to the game itself. 

I think that if you are a fan of Jagged Alliance 2 and really turn-based tactics in general, you will really, really enjoy this one. There is a demo and you should absolutely give it a try. You may have just found what you didn't know you were missing.

The gameplay and tactics were pretty good at launch, and have only improved since then. The developers actively listen to feedback from the fans, and have implemented some changes that have made the game much better in the time since release. I give them major credit for supporting the game with significant content and balance/polish since launch.

There is quite a large variety of weapons, maps, and strategies to employ - but to me the most endearing part is the return of those classic Jagged Alliance mercenaries. 
If you haven't played a Jagged Alliance title, who you hire (and how much they like the other mercs on their team) plays a real part in how you approach the overall strategy of the game. 

Mercs vary greatly in skills, salary, starting equipment and stats. Certain mercs are friendly to each other and actually perform better together, while other mercs dislike each other - and some will simply refuse to work with each other at all.
Listening to their comments and quips runs anywhere from hilarious, to annoying - but never boring. They are the 'soul' of the game and all of their interactions and quirks are what makes a game a true Jagged Alliance title to me. I've seen other games (even some.. er.. questionable spin-off's in this series) try to get this right and some do OK, but this feels light years closer to the JA games of old. 

It really does feel like it lives up to the name Jagged Alliance III.

And then came the latest patch. At first I did not experience any problems, then some and now the entire game is frozen in mid-fight. Nothing seems to help, not removing the mods and restarting, no nothing. It seems I have to restart everything anew without any mods - and this really really pisses me off.

Positive:
+ A ton of great features from the original JA2:
  + Non-linear progression (you can choose where to start, where to focus your attacks etc.)
  + Mercs with distinct characters, likes and dislikes
  + Lots of hidden (but mostly not too hard to find) side quests, secrets, loot etc.
  + A ton of hilarious jokes
  + True turn-based combat!
  + Interrupts during turns in combat
  + The same game principles of travel, conquest, training etc.
  + Many other small features such as modding weapons, re-rolling RNGs on quickload etc.
+ Decent graphics with nice details (e.g. sliding into cover, hit & death animations, ...)
+ Suitable difficulty modes for everyone
+ Co-op campaign?! (haven't tried it yet, but the mere idea is great)
+ Lovable cameos
+ A well-balanced combat system
+ Few to no visible/obvious bugs (so far for me)
+ A campaign much more complex and captivating as the one from JA2

Negative:
- No internet shop or similar (like in JA2) where you can buy much needed supplies. I have almost completed the campaign and have found ~2 lockpicking kits so far. Next time I'll hire Vicky Waters from the start...
- Some events seem to put the player in a surprisingly hard spot; you talk to someone and suddenly you're surrounded by 10+ enemies with no cover whatsoever? How do you solve that without quickloading and preparing a ton of explosives before? Surely this can't be the intended solution.
- Some (side) quests are hard to understand. At times it is not clear if you have everything you need to solve it or where you should look for more clues. The main questline doesn't seem to have this problem (as far as I can tell now)

This version feels forced in certain spots. I found my way to a prison in the beginning and thought I could stealth it, Yet it's obviously programmed to not allow it and it's very frustrating to find things like that. They make it open world but gate you out and force you in to fire fights, annoying. I also get frustrated with games like this that won't let you loot enemies after you kill them. Only select enemies are carrying loot. So far, 5 hours in and I can't figure out how to sell weapons. Weapon modding is neat, several options there. MERCs keep their stats and gear if you fire them, so you can rehire later. It has all the hallmarks of Jag, but it's not quite there yet. maybe they'll do some tweeking to the game and get it on track. I enjoy the action shots and run and guns as it feels very X-Comish. For now, Worth the buy if you are a Jag fan.

EDIT : I discovered a few annoying things that the devs really need to fix. They are gating difficulty by making enemies stronger and faster versus smarter. For example, enemies kill me in one shot with a machete but all I can do is give them a paper cut with one. They make enemies that are higher level and difficulty impossible to sneak attack kill, as in impossible to hit, or you do almost no damage, that's dumb. Sneak attacks should be nearly 99% hit rates. Also when you save during a battle, when you reload the turn it auto ends your turn, I don't know if this is a flaw or a feature. I think it's a flaw. If enemies are going to discover dead bodies, then they need to add the option to carry and hide dead bodies. Enemies and MERCs not having view cones when visibility is a thing in stealth is a must need as well. 

EDIT : One major issue : NPCs that cause you to lose loyalty when they die during raids and city events are SUICIDAL. It's almost impossible to keep them alive.

I would really like them to add model changes for gear the MERCs are wearing. Only certain items show on certain MERCs.

This game really feels like unfinished business. See what i did there?

already lots of detailed reviews from the veterans here but the most i can say is that it does keep most of the JA2 footprint intact. probably the main difference i can see is that in-game online store is not present (but will be added in the future), map is more linear when travelling around, no more non-specialized fighters to work on your logistics as there's no home base so to speak. 

a lot of the mercs from the previous game are present and all of them have their own personalities. there's only a few select interactions between mercs

like all turn-based strategy games, it's hard from the start with the crappy weapons and starting mercs but it's smooth sailing after that. never had a problem with money or equipment as there's more than enough to get by even with the mines that's your main source of income running out

i enjoyed the jokes and references for the most part, i they're pretty inoffensive

tldr; i think it's a worthy sequel. like turn-based rpgs that isn't the usual dnd setting? you ever wanted wasteland 2/3 with more gameplay than rpg? i'd say go for it. would probably play this again once the modding community has something more big or if they even put up like an expansion that can change the campaign",1698385802,1698385802,True,4,0,0.556414306163787842,0,True,False,False

While not as deep and lacking much of the micromanagement that I personally much loved in JA2, this third installment still manages to be a consistently fun game with enough complexities to keep me going all the way to the end and abound with ""oh snap!"" moments.

Both the main quest and many of the side quests are interesting and entertaining, with generally great voice acting. The sector conquest system more or less sticks to the JA2 formula. The sectors themselves look great and are quite varied, providing for an assortment of tactical challenges. The enemies could definitely be smarter, but they do provide enough of a challenge for most of the game. Changing weather conditions and the good ole' day-night cycle dramatically change the strategies you should use if you want to be successful.

As a veteran of JA2, I did miss quite a few things, while others took some time to get used to. The sectors are noticeably smaller than those of JA2, so some of them feel more like a purpose-built playground than actual terrain. This is especially true for the first couple of sectors you'll traverse. Thankfully, there are many other sectors to which this does not apply.
At first, I hated that your characters have 360 vision, but I got used to it eventually. I also sorely missed the ability to strafe, keep your weapon raised and things like that, as well as the rewards and penalties that come with those actions.
Unlike in JA2, attacks by enemy squads roaming the map are few and pose a very limited threat. In addition to that, you ALWAYS see all enemy squads in the satellite map for some reason, which is ludicrous and, in my opinion, a poor design choice, since it completely removes the surprise factor.

I haven't played much yet, but so far very disappointed.  I loved the turn based strategy in the originals, but the thing that set them apart from other games was the characters who came alive with excellent voice acting, animation, and real personality.  
My first impression is that the voice acting was performed by 3rd graders.  The toughest mercs sounded like they haven't gone through puberty, and made no effort to sound like the original characters  (voice or accent). No attempt was made to animate the characters during dialogs, as should be done in 2023.
Running the game causes my monitor to flicker until I reboot.
The interface is confusing, and there is very little explanation of the mechanics of the controls in the tutorial.
I plan to update this review, if I have any additional insights, good or bad.
Addendum:
The recent update fixed the monitor flicker.  Online tutorials on the basic mechanics are very hard to find, but I finally found some good ones.  They made the game much more playable.  I would now rate the game 6.5/10.",1695888748,1698081656,True,0,0,0.573931753635406494,0,True,False,False

I'm not familiar with the other games in the series, but what drew me in was the ""expendables"" style bombastic action-hero archetypes. The over-the-top campy/snarky plot, even the look of the game, but that's where it ends. 

It's got its handful of glitches that ruin the overall experience- I blow up cover with grenades but the game still says enemies are behind full cover. 

Enemies just have way too much health and it doesn't translate over to this kind of world well. They take a few grenades and shots to the face to be killed. You would think the optimal cover is ""full cover"" but apparently it's bushes? Where the AI dodges everything you throw at them. Or they just run up in your face and unload creating this economy of bandages that I don't like.

Stealth is just a horrible option. There's one mission early game, at night, in the rain, where you think a stealth-focused character would excel but enemies detected me more effectively than they would in the daytime. I tried to see if they had night-vision goggles or something but they were just normal goons. Doesn't make any sense.

Unique problems:

1. Low weapon variety - Sniper rifles: G98, SVD , M24
2. Weird drop system - best way to get new guns is to auto-resolve battle between militia and someone else

The Jagged Alliance series (particularly the second one) was one of those series that formed a big part of my gaming youth so when Jagged Alliance 3 seemed to appear out of nowhere I was super excited by perhaps overfly cautious of how it would turn out and I am happy to say that I WAS transported back to the high-stakes world of mercenary warfare. The series' trademark blend of  tactical combat and stylised storytelling is as strong as ever, and it's clear that the developers have taken great care to honour the franchise's legacy.

One of the first things that struck me was the visual overhaul. The graphics have received a significant upgrade, and the attention to detail in character models, environments, and weapons is remarkable. It's a far cry from the pixelated days of the past, and while not overly realistic I feel like the settled for an art style and will serve the game well in years to come. 

The game's story-line is engaging enough and I was surprised at how many unexpected twists and turns it took.  It's a balance of dark humour, political intrigue, and morally complex decisions, which are hallmarks of the Jagged Alliance series. You'll encounter a variety of memorable characters, each with their own distinct personalities and backstories. The return of mercs like Ivan Dolvich and Grizzly was a nostalgic delight and the new additions to the roster fit in nicely. I am personally glad they stuck to the overtly over the top personalities that DO feel like they come straight out of 80's action movies. 

The heart of Jagged Alliance 3 is, of course, its turn-based combat, and it doesn't disappoint. The tactical depth is actually really good - and I enjoyed how the game encourages experimentation and adaptability. The ability to set up ambushes, use the terrain to your advantage, and coordinate team actions provides a level of strategic satisfaction that kept me engaged during my first play through which lasted well over 60 hours on Commando (hard) mode. 

Weapon and gear customisation has been improved, allowing for a degree of personalisation but I did find myself wishing there was a wider variety of base weapons. But the ones available do allow you to equip your Mercenaries to suit various play styles, and managing your team's load-out and upkeep becomes a strategic game in itself. I did find this element of the game perhaps the most frustrating with the balancing of the 'scrap' drops slightly out of sync in my opinion. 

The only slight disappointment for me was the size of the maps - I just wish they were even 20% larger than they are at the moment. 

In conclusion, Jagged Alliance 3 is a triumphant return to form for the cult series. I think it captures the essence of what made the originals so great while adding modern elements that make it feel fresh and relevant and I am sure it will pull in a few players new to the series as a result. If you're a fan of turn-based tactics, storytelling that does not take itself too seriously and the thrill of commanding a team of mercenaries this game is a must-play. 

Jagged Alliance 3 is a love letter to the series' dedicated fan base and a warm welcome to newcomers, and I am looking forward to taking a new band of merc through a second run.",1698057902,1698058050,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nothing! They fixed it all!

The developers have fixed literally every complaint I had with the initial release, including the two big ones: pause during real time, and a rendering issue that made certain objects look ""jittery"" even at high framerates. 

You can now pause during real-time play (outside of combat), allowing you to actually orchestrate ambushes and sneaky maneuvers. The weird ""jitter"" issue is fixed and 60+fps actually FEELS like 60+ fps now (smooth as butter).

The Good:
The gameplay is AWESOME. Do not listen to anyone complaining about the fact that this game doesn't give you a clear-cut hit chance. Removing that stat is a sheer stroke of genius on the developers part. You can still get a feel for your odds by looking at the modifiers, which the game DOES spell out for you - and your mercs will TELL YOU verbally how they feel about their odds in any situation. This still gives you a good general feel for your odds and makes fights feel a lot more organic and natural; so ultimately you take more chances, trust your gut a lot more often, and sweat the raw statistics a lot less. It feels good. It feels REALLY good. Just keep that in mind, because if you come from similar games, you've probably developed some statistical perfectionist habits, and you need to unlearn that to enjoy this game.

The game has PERFECT ultrawide (21:9 & 32:9) support and plays very well on Steam Deck (maybe because of that Reflections setting). For ultrawide gamers, it even has a setting that lets you contain the UI to a 16:9 section of your monitor, rather than automatically having everything anchored way off at the edges. It's a magnificent QOL option that every PC game should include.

If you've never played a Jagged Alliance game before, they have recaptured the tone perfectly. You hire mercs for limited amounts of time, based on your shifting mission objectives... and these mercs feel like real people with very distinct personalities. Some of them don't get along at all, some get along... uh, a little TOO well... and some will straight-up refuse to work with certain others. It gives everything a texture, charm, and flavor that you won't find anywhere else.

Finally, this is a full RPG... not just a tactics game. Your actions and decisions matter and will come back to help (or haunt) you.

The developers are clearly dedicated to (and passionate about) this game. They've fixed the rough edges and given it all the love and polish it needed to be at the top of it's class. JA3 gets one of my strongest recommendations: It's a must-buy for any fans of tactical games or classical RPGs.",1689364727,1697506769,True,0,0,0.529806911945343018,5,True,False,False

To begin, you're going to want to get one of those mods that enables displaying % chance to hit.  I know the devs made a very deliberate decision to hide that functionality (even though it is a feature they put into the game, it's just hidden) but the sheer number of factors that go into your chance to hit are legion and what you would reasonably expect to be an 80% chance to hit can be, and VERY often is, a 30% chance to hit at best.  Even if you want to turn the mod off later, start playing with one immediately for an hour or two to get a feel for the hit chance of various weapons.  There are at least 3 mods on the Workshop that offer this functionality, and they're not hard to find.

Second, hire Hennessy first.  There are several mercs who will refuse to work with him, but he's actually a really good shot and importantly, he costs half as much as any other merc with equally good aim. You'll want to capture the diamond mine to the southeast of your starting island ASAP, and if you stick him on the roof of the building with a sniper rifle that will be easy.  After this, use him to train the Marksmanship skill of your other mercs, then cut him loose.  Marksmanship is the most important skill in the game because as mentioned above, chances to hit are not as high as you might think, and this improves them.

Also, focus on finding better guns.  And ""better"" doesn't automatically mean ""more expensive"" or ""higher tech.""  The LMGs are ALL above-average guns that maintain very high hit chance out to sniper-like distances, and the MG42 you can get very early in the game can hit 5 or 6 enemies during a single overwatch.  LMGs are arguably the best class of weapons in this game, though there are a few higher end ARs that can function as effective sniper rifle replacements.  In any case, the best way to survive is to simply put enemies down.  Even on low difficulty, enemies hit like trucks.  Having a weapon that will put an enemy down rather than simply weakening them is the difference between your own life and death.

Also skip throwing knives.  They're a trap and they're worthless.  If you want a short-range damage dealer, get a hand cannon and stick a silencer on it.

Anyhow, once you've captured the rich mine southeast of the start and trained everyone's ability to hit stuff, what you do from there is very much up to you.  I'd recommend grabbing a second mine for more income, but it's really your call.",1697475103,1697475103,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are turned off by corny humor, stay clear because this has that same flavor as the original. The setup is very similar, including many of the same original characters and character creation. 

Some have complained about the unscalable UI and tiny text, but I'm an old coot with glasses on a laptop and I can read it just fine. The style of play is reminiscent of the original but I like how they do combat here. Some comparisons have been made to XCOM but really it's more like JA. I've seen YouTubes on how brutally difficult JA 3 is, but so were the originals. The game gives you setups that scale the difficulty. Definitely, the first shootout was not hard at all for me. 

If you liked the original JA series, I think you'll find this fun. I can tell right now this will be my game for the summer.

Update: now at nearly 20 hours in, I stand by my original thoughts with one caveat. I actually think the combat is slightly easier than the original. If you want it hardcore, you can make it harder, but I'm playing it on middle-of-the road difficulty. Also, gameplay moves along faster than the original, which is a big plus for me. Some folks don't like the fact that you don't know the percentages of hitting your target in combat, but I like it. It's more realistic in this sense.

Bad game design decisions list:

Some enemies do not react if you have a friggin FIREFIGHT 30 meters further away from them - shooting unsuppressed weapons, throwing grenades and such. In JA2 the moment you shot a bullet EVERYONE in the sector ran for the noise.

You set down C4s with remote detonator for a trap, change your mind and try to recover them back. Well, you can't - instead you salvage them, wasting the C4 and the detonator.

Game is far from realistic, you hit a boss (Jackhammer) point blank range with an AK-47, full burst. All of the bullets (8+) hit, he takes like 15 damage PER BULLET and yet he's still ""Very Strong"". You create a tactical strategy game and let enemies shrug off a full auto burst like it's nothing. This is X-COM 2 all over again - OP enemies and unrealistic bullet damage modelling.

Once you approach a group of enemies in stealth and kill one of them, the rest gets surprised and then as soon as you take another action they all run for cover like cockroaches. You can literally sneak your team into a perfect ambush and as soon as you take the second action all enemies run for cover, leaving your positioning worthless. What's the point of sneaking / ambush if enemies will have a magical initiative boost to run for cover, even if they are surprised?

Enemy's sight & discovery logic is completely messed up. They suddenly know about all of your mercs's positions, even if they are hiding in a shack at the other side of the map. Here's an example, I shot Jackhammer with a sniper from afar, while hiding the rest of the team in the watchtowers. He BEELINED to that watchtower and started shooting. What the hell is this?

When a sector you own is about to be attacked, you are given heads up beforehand. However you cannot see where the attacking force will come from, and in fact they don't come from anywhere but just pop right up at the sector! This means you won't be able to lay down ambushes on enemies that are coming to attack your sectors.

Current bug list:

When you quickload during combat the positions of your merc may get messed up.
I had Barry crouching in the corner of a building, when I loaded he was teleported outside.

On prison map if you are in stealth and alert an enemy in a combat and then load back the save before combat, as soon as you load the game the prisoners freak out and start running away triggering an alarm. This causes the enforcers to shoot them all. -------> this means save / load feature does not fully restore the game state, and starts game off a corrupted state.

On prison map you cannot melee stealth kill the guys in the watch towers near the date. You prepare takedown and then right clicking on enemies do not work. I had to resort to throw knife option.

More to add as I go through the game.

Good stuff:

Unique character models for every merc. It's a very nice touch.

Modified weapons' models change in game as well, another very nice touch.

But it became really tedious in the second half. Now on my 2nd playthrough the issues become more glaring. Beware, some minor spoilers coming up.

1. Bugs
The game has so many minor and major bugs (that just make it freeze) its just not fun. ""Courage"" quest even made me reload some days before, losing some progress because it just freezes whenever i enter the sector now. Giving commands while in pause in RT mode also reliably freezes the game.

2. The UI/Obscuring information
The whole interface just leaves a lot to be desired. I respect not wanting to show percentages, like XCOM. But just show me what ""32"" range means. Just show me what ammo type is loaded without needing to hover somewhere. The targetting information UI often overlaps the body part selection, so you cannot shoot at all. Disarming traps doesn't tell you which skill (explosive/mechanical) is needed before you try it. Does mechanical skill influence salvage? I simply do not know. Also it takes a lot more clicks than necessary to move/shoot in turn based mode.
Also give us an option for making notes on sectors or at least add some crucial information on discovery, most important vendors.

3. Repetition/AI/weapons balancing
Combat is fine and engaging for the first few sectors if you don't know how to abuse stealth/melee. After getting the first Winchester/G98 it becomes repetitive and tedious relatively fast. Pistols/SMGs become obsolete fast and while you can use explosives/heavy weapons later, they are more of a hassle than improvement. Sniper rifles and melee are OP, partly due to the KI being so bad. The enemies just run into chokepoints like crazy. In the later stages, enemies get better equipped, but not any smarter. The whole combat becomes tedious. Scout sector while stealthed. Find lone soldiers and snipe/melee them from stealth (even easier at night). Set up sniper position. Do 1-2 rounds of turn based combat where you headshot the remaining enemies.

4. Stealth/sight
I like the concept of it, but the implementation is just bad/op. Why can my mercs obviously walk in front of an enemy soldier in broad daylight without being seen. Bar some stealth perks/night, the moment i can see the enemy, he should be able to see my mercs. This issue seems to be even more serious when at night, which makes night combat so much easier.
Also, the option to re-stealth in combat, combined with the bad AI is just op. If there are 5 snipers on a roof in one turn and they all restealth, even if the AI cannot see them, it should at least take into account them staying in place. They will not have vanished into thin air suddenly. This is also one of the reason why melee combat is much more op than desired. Militia/NPC AI is infuriating (Kayla the Cutter, please get some sense of self preservation!) for the same reason.

5. Story/pacing
I really like that the game has so many sidequests and outcomes that the replayability should be there. Sadly, the moment you hold the left side of the map (3 mines without Fosse Noire) you can stall the game forever and just train your elite squad of mercs however long you want. The only moment you feel under any pressure, is when Biff calls for help. And while responding is optional, it makes the game so much easier, but also shuts you out from a lot of sidequests in the refugee camp. I really would like the mines to provide less stable income/dry up faster so you cannot sit and watch you mercs train all day. Also, even elite milita not being helpful at all after the Corazon reveal, defeats any point of training them. I also would like the sidequests to be more impactful and give better rewards. Because after Biff, you rarely will find one necessary/helpful. You do them for fun but not because they give meaningful rewards (The ghost lady for example is really done well, because it gives you access to spend ressources for unique/meaningful rewards).

Tl;dr The story is neat and it's a nice game to play through once, maybe twice. For ~20€ i would have given it a thumbs up. The difficulty/AI is simply not there. UI is really lacking in some parts. Combat becomes tedious rather quickly, due to some aspects being op, mainly stealth/vision. Weapons balancing is really bad. Too many bugs that get not fixed quickly.",1697011589,1697020709,False,19,5,0.56115347146987915,0,True,False,False

There's been numerous attempts to revive the franchise and all of them have fallen short so far. JA3 is the successor I've been looking for, and whilst it might not dethrone JA2 as the Greatest Turn-Based Tactics game of all time, it's about as good of a sequel we could've hoped for. 

THE GOOD:
-Overwatch system is a lot easier to understand than interrupts, and doesn't allow high level enemies to turn doorways into complete deathtraps.
-Grenade throwing is also much more accurate than it was in JA2.
-Whilst the game does have an XCOM 2011-style cover system, objects between you and your target still affect shots. 
-Weapons now have more distinct roles. In JA2, you basically went from Pistols > Shotguns/SMGs> Rifles> Assault Rifles/Sniper Rifles > Machine Guns. Weapons now have more purpose, with special attacks such as Run and Gun for SMGs. Even weapons within their own catagories have their own niches (such as the AK-74 being really good against armor or the Winchester 1894 being a shorter ranged sniper rifle), which really adds to the variety. I've used starter weapons deep into the game which is not something I could say about JA2. 
-I thought I wouldn't be big on the perk system, but I think it adds a lot of depth without being as overwhelming as something like Battle Brothers. I feel even if you build a character 'wrong', you'll still be fine for the most part anyway.
-Much like JA2, there's lots of ways to build teams, approach the map, and perform missions, giving the game a lot of replay value. I'm already 60+ hours in and I can't get enough.
-Modding support. Adding the the above point, there's plenty of mods, which I've yet to touch.
-Diamond and Gun transports add a bit more to the overworld tactics, allowing you to get new weapons or a much needed cash boost. 
-Roadmap for updates is promising and shows the devs really care about their product. 

THINGS PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE:
-The game isn't the most realisitc. Then again it's not like JA2 was either. The franchise was always supposed to lean more into action movies than any form of milsim. 
-There's quite a few scripted events that will catch you off guard on a first playthough. One in particular is pretty rough, but I still managed to survive it, only losing 2 members and IMO you should be expected to lose a few people along the way.
-Some people have struggled with ammo, but I've never had that much of an issue. Sure, you have to sometimes scrounge for dropped ammo, but militias make this easy enough. Plus, Bobby Ray's is coming in v1.3. 
-Invetory is a little different and now Strength dependent. It does dumb some things down, such as the fact a belt-fed MG is as much of a burden as an MP5 submachine gun, but it also makes STR much less of a dump stat. 
-Chance to hit isn't shown without a mod. I might be in a minority, but I really like this. When my brain sees 80% to hit, I think “I'm gonna hit” rather than “I have a 1 in 5 chance to miss”. This allows me to focus more on tactics and positioning which is what actually wins fights. It also can be modded in pretty easily if you want.  
-There's not much of a story, but that's never been Jagged Alliance's strong suit. 
-I've had 2 crashes, but considering 60 + hours of gameplay, that's pretty good. Game has a generous autosave system anyway. 

THE BAD:
-Mercs are nowhere near as funny as JA2. This was always going to be a tall order, but it's noticable. That being said, there's still some good dialog from the mercs, and I still prefer the personality driven characters over something like X-COM. 
-A lot of the humor is also going to be very dated in 5 or so years. Cryptocoins, lootboxes, the Coronavirus etc. 
-AI Could be better. It's pretty easy to bait them into killzones if you set your men up. I wish they'd bunker down a little more, especially consideirng there's a lot of options to dig them out. 
-I feel that some of the lower tier mercs don't fill vital rolls. For example, Livewire and Steroid are the only early mercenaries with high Mechanical scores, and Steroid has poor attributes and doesn't play nice with others. 
-We're also missing some vets from the previous games such as Spider, Trevor and my boy Stephen Rothman
-Panic and Berserk from the new XCOM games are here and I hate it. Losing control of a character is really frustrating, especially when morale can drop just because a few mercs got injured after you dropped 5+ enemies in a turn.",1697002112,1697002112,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

Don't buy it, its raw garbage - JA gameplay with really bad writing/events.  
I can't tell you how many times I alt F4ed, the game is nothing but frustration.

Its not the game mechanics either, its the retarded events - the devs are like bad fanfic writers. There are at least 3 events where you randomly get into a fight that makes no fucking sense and its sheer stupidity. 
If you don't know about the fights, you lose an entire team of mercs.  That would be fine, but somehow we're at a 3rd installment and still only have 40 mercs - with half of them going MIA or refusing to hire on because of some retarded reason. 
Sidney: ""I have to go debate my friend about futball"" <---- Told to me 5 fucking months ago.

There is 1 event with Smiley and the Church where you are randomly surrounded, I had 1 merc (Fauda)  to go pick him up....spent 2 hours getting out of that one and thats WITH 8 vet guards.

There is another at the refugee camp, where you CAN NOT LEAVE. So as soon as you start and can easily tell you're going to need back up?? You're fucked.
I lost Flay to 20 guards because I was having him pick up gear.

I don't mind an ambush...but when I can see it coming and can't leave? That is just fucking retarded.

And now I have yet another retarded ambush to get out of.....Boss and Luigi. I tell them I'm not getting involved in their stupid spat and they ALL decide to attack my group. So now for me to continue playing the game without losing 6 mercs I'm going to have to spend hours rolling the dice.

Its just fucking stupid, I don't mind losing mercs on bad plays...I can even deal with Reaper walking off to go get gynoplasty and ""cleanse himself""...Hell in JA 1 I even dealt with the assholes walking off with my equipment.
But this forced garbage writing REPEAT ""Now you die"" shit is ridiculous.

I spent 2 hours training and gearing mercs in prep to take the middle isle and finish out the game (Modded in tony's shop because bad game design) just to accidentally enter the mob boss's mansion, to get ambushed. I alt F4ed and uninstalled.

On top of this nonsense:
You still don't have a shop.....fucking mercenary company that can't equip its mercs is nonsense and inexcusable in 2023.  This isn't a DOS game anymore.
You run out of money eventually - The diamond mines magically last 2 whole fucking days.
The merc pool is weak and the personalities just aren't there.
You can't attack a sector with enemies with multiple squads, despite the game mechanics being there for it.
Full Auto damaged was nerfed so its basically pointless, even at point blank, because the developers are retarded and need to retire.

On a more positive side of things:
I found and recruited Larry, I sent him to K10 alone & unarmed to die because I hate him. Mother fucker walked around throat punching people to death...all the while talking about his super secret shadow, cheering at fighting zombies, and telling Ted to stfu.

For those who don't know, the Jagged Alliance series is a series of turn based tactics games with simulation elements where you hire and command a group of mercs across a long campaign split between a tactical map where you fight battles, and a larger strategic map where you make broader decisions. The series is very heavily influenced by action movies, and the mercenaries are individual characters with their own unique personalities, quirks, and occasional personality conflicts. While there is a pretty clear continuity in the game series, you don't really need to play the earlier games to enjoy this, and the first game has not aged well at all.

As for this game in particular? It feels like they made a very faithful modernization of the Jagged Alliance 2 formula. Almost every feature of the second game is also in this one, but they added some modern elements of turn based tactical games such as perk trees, modifiable weapons and special abilities. What hasn't returned is the online gun store, but that will be patched in later on. The list of mercenaries is also much much smaller, but they kept most of the popular ones and now they are further differentiated from each other by each having a special passive or active ability that your own player created ""I.M.P."" merc can't get. 

There's overall more sidequests and plenty of characters to meet, with many map tiles having plenty to do, or at least plenty to loot. Several of the sidequests have multiple solutions. Combined with a large cast of mercenaries, many of which don't get along, you have plenty of replay value and plenty of things to try even on one playthrough.

I think rather than explaining everything cool about this game, one of the best ways to explain why this is a neat game is to summarize what happened when I tried to take one sector. I had a sniper with a silent sniper rifle, and a bunch of other characters using reduced noise subsonic ammo or knives, so I figured I'd take a camp stealthily.  I had Barry shank each individual guard I could have him sneak up on, however I ended up alerting a group of 3 enemies at one point. Not wanting to alert the whole camp, I had my guys with SMG's take out 2 of them, only for the third one to be quite a distance away. So I had my sniper stand up and deliver a very long range headshot on the remaining guy... Except... The bullet penetrated his skull, then went through the wall of a nearby building and through the head of another guard I didn't see, dropping him right in front of 2 other guards, who then ran outside and fired their guns in the air alerting the rest of the camp. This stealth takeover of a camp went loud, entirely because the game has proper bullet penetration.

I've had other cool moments. I've blown the floor out from underneath enemies hiding behind railings on the second story of a building I was clearing out, only to shank them when they fall to the ground floor. I've tricked enemies into chasing my guys down a minefield and then blew up mines around them. I've used a shotgun to blow apart wooden boxes enemies were hiding behind and then followed up with another merc firing at the now exposed enemies. There's a lot of cool moments to be had in this game, and I feel like it's not only a worthy successor to Jagged Alliance 2, but it's up there with the new XCOM games and Phoenix Point in terms of being a good modern turn based tactics game.",1696846575,1696846575,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its tone is that of a 90s action movie - and if you look at it from that lens, it's a mix of fun and serious that JA2 also had, but more fleshed-out. JA2 felt unfinished in a few areas - at least to me - and that is not a present feeling in JA3.

Starting with the bad, this is a AA game in a lot of ways. Rough overland UI that *automatically advances time even if you have idle units after issuing a single command* has caused me numerous headaches. It rips away your agency for no reason.
The enemy AI is a mixed bag at best, though there is a noticeable difference in tactics between more-experienced troops and rookies. The biggest problem is an imbalance in the game's rules between your mercs and the enemy. They get to scatter and sometimes fire back when you ambush them, and the stealth mechanics are not well-documented. 
Perhaps just as bad as unpredictable mechanics is imbalance. As others have said, the most-viable way to play is sniper-stealth and optionally to set up machine guns if you can afford their ammunition use. Armor and swelling HP pools make the assortment of handguns and SMGs nonviable, as even aiming for weakspots will simply fail to do enough damage to drop most foes in a turn and will take more AP than just using a rifle to pop them in the head once or twice. Or use explosives.
There's some difficulty pacing issues to my eyes, though this is offset somewhat by it being narratively-justified. Unlike JA2 where you could end up fighting 30+ redshirts in some pretty-epic against-the-odds battles, it just doesn't happen in JA3. There are no hostile armored vehicles, despite a ""super-heavy"" armor-piercing property existing, even if they were just pillboxes of doom in JA2. I'd have loved to face BMPs or even just technicals.
Despite accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars, you cannot import equipment. Hiring mercs later in the game, even the best ones come with horrendous gear, so you need to have weapons, ammunition and armor ready to give them when they arrive. Just as with JA2, the enemy doesn't drop all their stuff, so getting all of that gear can take a lot of time and luck.

It's not a bad game overall, though - I quite like it, and played it right back through on a higher difficulty when I finished it the first time. Mercs are plenty-fun and memorable, mixing corn and solid performance along with more-defined personalities as they interact with Gran Chien's inhabitants. 
I love the intel system, rewarding exploration and interrogation. Mercenary skills and traits influence how you can go about this - negotiators, scoundrels, loners and psychopaths all have special dialogue options, for example, opening new paths and insights. The information ranges from enemy patrol areas, minefields, gun emplacements to stashes of loot. Varied composition of your party is beneficial from the very beginning - having at least a mechanic/lockpicker/hacker/modder and explosives expert goes a long way, and you'll want but can get by without a leader, strong merc, and doctor.
The weapon modification system is a fun idea, though perhaps a bit overpowered in some ways. You can build your weapons for fast, short-range shots with faster/better aiming, or more aim steps and range, or improved magazines and reliability, for a few examples. Suppressors are key for covert attacks, obviously.
The perk system adds plenty of options, though some outshine others with the gun balancing. Some add new abilities that change how the merc can be used in combat, many enhancing mobility which is frequently helpful. They're anchored to breakpoints in the primary attributes of the merc, but thankfully it's not too difficult to train up to what you need, generally-speaking.
In general, I enjoy the combat systems JA3 uses. Overwatch and explosives work much as they do in XCOM, instead of the RNG ""interrupts"" of JA2. Lethality of *most* weapons will give you enough time to react to them instead of immediately dropping your mercs.

I'm sure I could come up with more to say, but this will suffice for now. I hope the game gets better over time - so many little things could make this game great.",1690677634,1696766052,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I never played the classics much (only a bit of JA2) but comparing to the likes of XCOM this plays similarly and has a comedic tone to it throughout. The game is a turn based tactical sort of game but expands on this by also having a map system where inbetween battles you also manage aspects like your party of misfits, training up local militia and defending places you have secured. The game becomes a sort of combo of a world map management deciding where to prioritise next and then jumping into tactical gameplay. 

The humour is what really sets the game apart, with the turn based play you also then hire various people at various rates who are all over-the-top caricatures with their own cheesy voice lines and skills. The whole tone feels super 90s (with even much of the UI feeling like 90s computer browsing) and you end up picking certain characters to join your party on personality alone.

What I don't enjoy so much with the game however is the balance is a bit all over the place, it might be how I play but I've found that grenades/rpgs and heavy machine guns feel way overpowered, and using them together across your group makes a lot of missions way easier. Additionally, the setting and the general plot is a bit meh, its very generic feeling and you get many side quests that can only be described as bizarre. To be fair though, you would really be coming to this game for the gameplay and tactics.

For JA vets, JA3 nails the feel and atmosphere of the older games, with the same mercs you know and love. The story is a little less 'Elliot, you idiot!' slapstick but still has that brand of 90's humour in spades. The mercs are more vibrant with more personality than ever.

For those who are wondering, JA3 has the following:
- Simulated projectiles.
- Action point system.
- Iconic JA aiming system returns, use AP to aim more.
- Destructible/penetrable environments and cover.
- Proper flanking and set up possible.
- Can take out the whole map with stealth using a knife, like in JA2.
- No chance to hit indicator.
- Stances.
- Plenty of gun/weapon choices, fully customisable.
- Enemies move in groups. These are not the same as X-Com ""pods"". Only enemies that can see or hear you kill one of their allies, or notice a dead body will be alerted. You can take out enemies stealthily room by room. If you make enough of a ruckus, you will eventually alert the whole map.
- Heavy mod support. JA3 1.13 can become a reality.
- Specialists (eg medical, explosives, mechanical, leadership, etc) are more important than previous games.
- Weather/time of day will affect merc performance. 

Some drawbacks:
- Inventory system. It's simultaneously more cumbersome but also more dumbed-down than JA2.
- Transparency for morale and stamina, you're always guessing why morale is up/down and you never know when your mercs need rest.
- Gun balance. Certain weapons are overtuned. Sniper rifles in particular have no real disadvantage, and SMGs/pistols/dual wielding feels high risk/low reward.
- Stealth system is almost identical to Silent Storm. I've always preferred JA2's 'line of sight' detection. Not a dealbreaker though.
- Perk balance. Some are simply not fun such as 'Lightning Reflexes'. It might be there to balance out sniper rifles, but honestly an ""invulnerability shield"" has no place in a JA game.
- Strategic operation assignment is serviceable, but needs improvement.
- Enemies can move a short distance when alerted. Again, not a dealbreaker as you almost always have the drop on the enemy and can setup however you like before you pull the trigger.
- Suppression and enemy health status needs work. Enemies on 1HP should not be just as dangerous as those on full health. Enemies should be able to be suppressed by all bulletfire, not just MGs on full auto. These things are staples of Jagged Alliance and need to be restored.
- No Lynx, or Buzz Garneau.

It activates usually as enemies enter at long ranch (where my shots are going to miss because of the range) or when they move through cover (where they miss due to cover). Having made an attack that has no chance of hitting the perp then rushes me and stabs me to death with a knife. Also - if I shoot said baddie they invariably make a reflex attack that is guaranteed to cause much pain. Having only  just made it off the starting island this appears a bit heavy handed.

Like JA2, it's best when you play with mods on. I know the devs don't approve of playing with the hit percentages on but I think at least for the first few missions it helped to see what exactly was going on with the cover systems, and I also like the ""mines don't run out"" mod because it adds some longevity to the game and doesn't make it feel like a rush. 

My one (very minor) complaint would be that I wish there was an option to end free roam the moment an enemy is in view. This would allow for better tactical pre-battle planning, which is made more difficult with a controller. I also wouldn't mind seeing more gun types, but it looks like the devs are aware of this and have actively been pushing patches to make that more mod-friendly, a fantastic compromise. 

This is a rare modern sequel that understands its lineage and makes smart, incremental QOL changes. It's hard but not unforgivable, it controls exactly the way I want a JA game to play in 2023, and most importantly, it doesn't try to be something the series is not, like every JA game since 2.

Sometimes the dialogue are cheesy but I like it.

The campaign is choice driven, and choices matter. For veteran tactical rpg players out there, I recommend Commando and Mission Impossible difficulty settings, if you like to torture yourself with mercenary perma-death.
The campaign also boasts around 50 hours of gameplay if you rush it, but if you take your time and do all side quests it's around 75+ hours. Obviously I'm reviewing this only about at 30 hours and I feel I'm still around the first acts of the game.

Overall, this is a great game.
I enjoy using stealth to thin out some of the enemies until I get caught, sparking mini or sector-wide battles.
The tactical battle scenes are done well, with lots of options depending on your players skills and weapons. 

Overwatch works well because of hidden enemies and their aggressiveness. Nothing forces you to be aggressive with your attacks. If anything, it is better to be risk adverse and setup defensive points and slowly progress. If you are too aggressive, you will find a group of enemies that will quickly mow down your exposed agents.

The auto resolution is a nice touch for highly probably wins.

I think improvements could be done on claiming territories and income/mines. 
The enemy randomly fights back to claim territories so it is important to have some miltia and a backstop team available outside of your main attacking force.

Renewing contracts gets annoying, you should be able to dismiss an agent if it is time for a change.

This game stays true to that it's an okay game, with a couple mods though that make it feel more like the community patch for JA2, It truly is the sequel we've been waiting for.

It's not perfect, there are some weird bugs, there quips are like JA2, in that they can get old, but you'll still smirk occasionally. The one thing it's really missing is being able to pause during real time mode to issue commands. There is a mod that adds it, but it's not the same as a baked in feature.

Long and short, it's the best addition to the series since JA2, not saying BIA and Crossfire were kind of bad (even though I've played them a lot, and on their own, they are decent games, just they never lived up to the JA franchise) This is the one I've been waiting for.

The good, The gameplay and mechanics are good, The graphics are okay, The layout is decent, and the story and lore and decently developed

The bad, There are bugs, one that took me about 30 seconds to figure out what happened is if you end combat with you're machine gunners with the machine in Overwatch, or setup, whatever you want to call it, they don't come out of that mode automatically, even if you go to map mode. So if you access sector inventory, they will be locked out because ""the merc is busy"" This will persist even after moving to another sector, until you either

A: if you haven't changed sectors, go back to the tactical map and tell them to break down the machinegun nest.

B: If you've moved sectors, you need to enter the tactical map, then exit back to sat view. Either of these will unlock their inventory. This seems like a bit of an oversight.

Bad point number two I've already mentioned, you can't toggle real time to paused to give commands. These is a long standing feature of these games and I am disappointed it's not there.

The next bad is the combat system. There is a mod to fix this, but in previous JA games, if you went a certain number of rounds without seeing the enemy, it would exist combat mode, This is not true with this game, so you can lose 30 minutes going turn by turn moving across the map to find the one opponent, that is completely unaware you exist, because it didn't exit conflict mode.

There are some other frustrations, however there's more good than bad, I've played 52 hours as of this review (probably 2-3 of that was the aforementioned going across entire maps in conflict mode) I really like the game, and it takes me back a lot.. So well done to the team.

IF you're a Jagged alliance fan, yes, it's jagged alliance, and it's a bit... jagged around the edges. However it's an amazingly good game, and it's worth playing.

TLDR: This is what you do all the time: https://media.tenor.com/wtCtrlgw-M0AAAAC/naked-gun-meme.gif

- Your average American schoolshooter or little kid who finds his dad's pistol stashed in the shoebox underneath the wardrobe can aim better than your mercs (even those with high skills). I'm talking missing shots from 1 block away with full aim. It takes 3 mercs 3 rounds to even hit a target 6 feet away. I had Grizzly for 7 days, he never managed to land a single hit. The ""feedback"" you get from your mercs is very misleading at times. The ""sure shot"" misses and if you save scum it you miss 5 times more.

- Mouse control is really bad, commands just don't happen when you click oftentimes, and they never work unless there's direct line of sight with your target (for example if you try to loot a box that you can see through a wall shown by a cutout around the box, you have to rotate the camera till you can see it and then issue the loot command). 

- Sometimes the game just doesn't do what you want it to do - for example, you have 2 mercs and 2 enemies, you make each merc knife one enemy in the back, one merc does their job while the other just goes up to the enemy and just hangs around there till they're spotted. No idea why. Maybe it's not allowed but I assumed the game allows you to stealth kill 2 people at the same time.

- The game is really unhelpful in many little ways. For example, if a merc leaves he takes the equipment you gave him with him. You can't just make him drop it. When moving around with multiple players it seems that when you take an action (ex hack a device), it doesn't pick the best merc for the job. Sometimes you want to run multiple operations concurrently, but as soon as you pick one the clock starts ticking and you lose time. Sector stash is kinda dumb. Unless I missed something the IMP isn't explained (along with so many other things in the game), so you miss out on that and other good stuff just because you don't know about them. This is usually the case with many games, but you can't track multiple quests/objectives on the tactical map because why would you... on a tactical map?!

- I haven't finished the game, nor do i want to, but it seems that after you leave the ""tutorial"" island, the rest of the map is just one contiguous block of terrains. There's virtually no natural barriers or chokepoints. This may or may not be a problem, but it feels like it might be one of those games where you will get attacked from all sides and you'll be running around defending your territory all over the place instead of focusing on your objectives. I might be wrong though.

- Some of the characters are really cringe, not in a nice way. You know the one.

I can forgive the unhelpful stuff, but honestly the dumb accuracy, unreliable command execution and mouse control issues make the game a tad too frustrating for me. I really wanted to like this game because I played similar games like XCOM and Shadow Tactics and those were fun.",1696284866,1696284866,False,15,2,0.529244303703308105,0,True,False,False

Even if I never managed to play it (I have trouble getting most of the JA2 games to run) I still wanted to reward and support any company willing to take on the franchise and bring it to the level of JA3.

I still stand by that, despite my experiences with the game so far.  The biggest issue, and one which is common to so many ""buy online"" games is the utter lack of instructions or documentation.  I can't be the only one on Steam who fondly remembers that days when a new computer game would include a game manual that was 30-50 pages thick and explained, with full-color text and screenshots, exactly what each game control was for, what each symbol meant, and what different color lines and arrows meant.

It wasn't too long after the demise of ""hardcopy"" games that manuals also went the way of the dodo.  Sure, some publishers did at least try to maintain the manuals, shifting to ""print at home"" versions, first in color, later in B&W.  I think the last time I saw such a manual (that wasn't user-written) was around 1999.

This game SERIOUSLY needs a full users manual that takes you screen by screen through a tutorial, explaining every symbol/line/color/indicator and what they mean/do, and how to use them.  And the manual needs to be PRINTABLE, so it can be referred to during gameplay without need to open several other windows.

My final impression is that this is JA2 as built by someone who has never played it, going just on when their older brother remembers about it when he played it 15 years ago.  Did anyone actually explain to the voice actors what the characters they're playing sounded like in the original?  Or did they just let Mrs. Wharton's 5th grade acting class ""wing it""?",1696195411,1696263626,False,2,1,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False

While it sounds cliche to say in 2023, but this game is certainly unfinished, and unpolished in many ways. The general gameplay is pretty decent, especially early-mid game, but late game leaves a lot to be desired. There are way too many thorns in your side once the ball gets rolling properly, but let's start with the positive:

+ Core gameplay is pretty decent
+ Graphics are solid
+ Sound & voice acting is on point
+ Level design is decent
+ Mercs are entertaining

- Braindead AI: Are you outnumbered? Don't worry, just setup a chokepoint, and watch enemy after enemy run into a barrage of shotgun, machinegun and rifle fire!

- Terrible inventory management system: Once your inventory gets a little full (which doesn't take long), it's a NIGHTMARE moving stuff around and just wastes so much time.

- Ammo types: I understand the old JA games had a nice variation, but this is just excessive.

- World Map: Way too big, too many outposts to defend and way too much time must be spent doing 5-6 things like training mercenaries (for what you may ask? An AI vs AI encounter which is gone in a click), resting, healing, crafting ammo and explosives, etc. 

- Storyline is hot steamin' garbage. Idea starts out interesting enough, but it quickly devolves into a meaningless excuse for a game. Rarely have I encountered a game with so much dialogue that is so god damn boring, most of it is irrelevant to the plot or the characters, it's just a bunch of random people you will probably never see again telling you their backstory. There is 0 connection with this random folk but they just don't shut up! Luckily it's all skippable :) 

- Looting: OMG I'm so sick of walking around the same rectangularly shaped maps just to loot all these stupid dead bodies. Again, more filler which just bring the game down but the playtime up.

----

Overall, it's not worth the full price. Wait until it goes on sale IF you are a fan of the Jagged Alliance series and/or you enjoy the tactical squad shooter genre. With that being said, there are probably better entries out there I haven't tried yet, but I can definitely say it doesn't come remotely close to X-Com or X-Com 2. I LOVE this genre but I can't bring myself to finish JA3 even after like 50+ hours of the game. If I'm really bored one night I might go for it.

- You can't carry / move / hide dead bodies. That doesn't work well at all with the stealth mechanic. - lazy devs

- Enemies will detect dead bodies from places where they have zero sight on the body. - lazy devs

- Stealth mechanic is non-intuitive in all fields of physics (visual, sound, lighting, distance etc). It's appalling. Your only reliable cue is the ""detection circle"" under your merc. That's how you know if today it just happens that you can easily knife-kill someone from the front, or tediously from the back, or get caught doing nothing while other goons are also doing nothing. - lazy devs

- You can shoot with a noisy gun 1 floor (of a house) below enemies described as SCOUTS and those two scouts won't budge. - lazy devs

- You can open huge french double-doors in front of a group of enemies WATCHING THE DOUBLE DOORS OPEN IN THEIR FACE and still avoid detection by just walking off while crouching. That's on difficulty 2/3. - lazy devs

- Visually identifying free ground and half/full cover is critically non-intuitive. You'll spend a painful amount of time hovering your mouse over rock formations, bushes and trees in order to correctly assess terrain. - lazy devs

- Every single map is filled with an embarrassing amount of high ground rock formations where mercs can't go, but would actually be the very best spot to attack from. - lazy devs

- From what I've seen yet, there's nothing in a jungle full of rocks and branches that would allow you to distract a braindead thug to make it move somewhere. - lazy devs

- This game has no animal wildlife except hyenas. No wolf, boars, tigers, squirrels, tiny critters, whatever... ONLY HYENAS ! You endlessly run through the worst s__t hole villages in the history of gaming, but you shall never see a single rat - lazy devs

- Watch your merc shoot POINT BLANK right in the head of a ""goon"" who has no helmet, and watch him survive. Or even worse, watch your merc miss. - lazy devs

- A thug with a bullet in the head and 1 HP left can spin around, go take cover, and shoot back at you, without any penalty. - lazy devs

- ""Action cam"" of ""sniper scopes"" will give you angles that are so bad-looking that you really wonder how it's possible that there's no option to disable that feature - lazy devs

- There is no cool moves in the game. The only ""prowess"" is a ""takedown"", and it's one of the ugliest animations you'll see in 2023. - lazy devs

- 90% of non-heavy ammo loot is useless, I never lacked any. Not even once. Utterly useless, inventory-bloating garbage. - lazy devs

- Nobody cares about the durability on any inventory item. The fun/challenge/novelty factor is zero, zero, zero. Utterly pointless time sink. - lazy devs

- In this ""realistic"" game, once you throw a knife, it stops existing. Also, knifes don't appear to exist in kitchens from all over the world. - lazy devs

- Some ""Recruits"" have attribute scores of 90+, even 95+, and the absolute max for any merc type is 100. After Recruits there are Veterans, Elites and Legendaries. So basically, only PERKS make a diff. - lazy devs

- I lied. Merc equipment is also better on higher ranked mercs. Oh, wait, you're already well past overstock on all that equipment. - lazy devs

- You can QUICKLY train a bunch of low-cost Recruits to have high attribute values, which trivializes mercs and their attributes - lazy devs

- You swiftly destroy an army of thugs, but guess what, no XP for you. Try some dialogue, somwhere, in hope of gaining some XP -- Ah, here's some XP - lazy devs

- Flashbangs don't even decrease accuracy -- how incredibly stupid is that ? Hello ? - lazy devs

- Event at difficulty 2/3, sometimes you'll watch an enemy go take position right next to one of your merc who has no cover, but for some reason will instead shoot a merc that's much further away, has 100% HP and is almost impossible to hit. AND the enemy will actually hit that guy.

- At difficulty 2/3, just camp a small bottleneck and watch every single enemy move over that spot and die to your overwatched mercs. - lazy devs

- Don't try to synchronize any multi-merc attack in this game -- it won't work. Just initiate a takedown with Fox, everytime, in every single encounter. - lazy devs

- The Tactival View can be full of ""tag stripes"" that obstruct view, and when you toggle the tag option on/off, IT DOES NOTHING. - lazy devs

- You enter a place full stealth, nothing has happened yet -- you haven't even deployed -- but all those civilians all over the map are already hunkered down - lazy devs

- I've seen ""goons"" move, shoot, move again, and shoot again in the same turn. Are they LEGENDARY goons or something ? - lazy devs

- Almost all stats are poorly designed. None appears to have more than a low impact on combat except Marksmanship and Explosives. - lazy devs

- The skill ""TAKING COVER"" while used behind ACTUAL FULL COVER appears to be the technical equivalent of ""standing still in the middle of an empty parking lot under a spotlight"" in XCOM2. - lazy devs

- About a third of the characters (mercenaries, by the way) sound like school kids and/or absolute dimwits who are easily offended by everything. - lazy devs

- There is a ""mishap"" mechanic in the game. You can have the best agility/dexterity/marksmanship/wisdom in the game, but if your ""explosives"" attribute is low, you'll throw grenades at yourself all day long. - lazy devs

- ALL ""Operations"" are time sinks, have zero fun factor in them, and involve zero tough decisions - lazy devs

- You can throw 3 grenades at the feet of some goon... he'll never become inaccurate, suppressed or slowed... but the cheapest pistol in the game ? yep that'll make anyone inaccurate, suppressed or slowed. - lazy devs

- Not a single overwatch shot in the game appears to inflict status effects - lazy devs

- Sorry, did your whole squad lose more HP in 1 second than in the last 10 previous battles combined ? yes ? ok that's because a merc walked on a mine while auto-pathing, out of combat - lazy devs

- You enter a village PACKED with military-aged men, you have plenty of guns and armor gear in your inventory, they all have absolutely nothing to do in that shithole of an island, but guess what... don't even try to recruit a single one of them. Good luck finding a quest for that either. Instead, sign expensive contracts with picky douchebags. - lazy devs

- If you don't have a crowbar and high Strength, forget it, you won't be able to open locked storage such as a toolbox. As if a group of merceneries with pistols, guns, explosives and ""parts"" can't find a way to bust a freakin lock. - lazy devs

- You can ""Hack"" a phone booth and immediately gain cash from that. WHAT ???????? - lazy devs

- This game is so bad, there's a ""crazy woman"" who make explosives all alone in that shack, she's called ""Deedee Boombastic"" and if you give her ""Parts"", she'll make you multiple types of explosives that your ""93/100 explosives expert"" can't even craft with those parts. Also, if you ask her to tell a joke, any merc around her will suffer ~25 dmg because the devs are funny. - funny devs

Every time you aim with a rifle your camera goes into Cinematic mode and resets.  Even if you turn the cinematic option off they for some reason they chose to force you to use it with rifles. (and this is as intended not a bug)  The cover and aiming system is poorly explained and you don't get any idea what the hit chance is even when spending action points to aim so you never know if it is worth it to aim or not.  

I do like the voice acting and the new characters were fun but the fact that you can't choose the top mercs to start with because they are simply locked was a weird choice.  It's not that you can't afford them but simply that they are locked.  This feels odd in a strategy game where choosing how to spend your money traditionally is such a part of the game.  

I can't review the full game due to the fact that I ended up returning it because of the frustrating camera controls but overall I felt they made a good attempt at getting the atmosphere of the game right but unfortunately the actual tactical part of the game play is better in the original games and nowhere near what you get out of the JA2 1.13 patch.

If I had one concern it would be that the AI isnt great. Their overwatches can be placed very poorly, but far more common is the frequent disregard for their own safety.

I enjoy many turn based tactics games like XCom or Gears Tactics... but this one has got to be the most annoying to play I've ever encountered.

Landmines are invisible and hidden everywhere. They do nothing except slow gameplay down requiring you to inch your way through a map incredibly slowly... and you're still likely to accidentally step on one due to pathing. And when you do, your mercs will become injured.

And when a merc is injured it lowers their max health, so you can't ignore it. So you take some downtime to heal them up, but your mercs are on a contract so you're running out of money while being able to do nothing. You have absolutely no source of recurring income until a few sections passed the starting island (which takes awhile to get through).

I've had to restart the game 4 times now because the tutorial is awful. It doesn't teach you what you need to know by walking you through it. There are some pop-up blurbs to help out, but they are not enough. Especially if you haven't played the previous games before.

And at one point on the starting island there is a dialogue tree where you can chose ""Joke"". I though 'ok, I'd like to hear a joke'.

I played JA2 growing up and was obsessed, it was easily in my top 5. When JA3 came out I figured it would be a fail like most games in a similar situation, but man was I wrong. I smashed out long sessions like I was a teenager again, losing track of time until early morning and being shocked at how immersed I was.
Although my basic laptop really struggled with the graphics even at the lowest setting, it was bearable enough for me to complete it. I was surprised how quickly I got through it all, but don't consider that a bad thing as I feel like I got to experience the full breadth of the story line without sinking so much time into it that I felt I was neglecting other responsibilities.

The references in the game were hilarious and did the original justice and more. I grew really fond of select mercs and ensured that I replayed saved games 10s of times over before letting them die.

+ Great models, graphics and maps (Outclasses almost anything else in this genre actually).
+ Challenging strategic layer and solid enemy AI during battles. 
+ Cool weapon crafting.
+ RPG progression and talent trees for your Merc's (And unique abilities for each one)
+ Fun 80's action theme/setting and memorable characters. 

- AI controlled allies can be derpy.
- Sometimes performance and frame rate stutters.
- Battles can drag out for too long occasionally. 
- Still no dedicated in game vendor for buying/selling (Though promised in an update)
- Limited customization for mercs (Though the game does have mod support). 

Gotta give a lot of props to the developers here. This is a steal on sale, well worth the asking price and frankly puts most AAA developers to shame.

Now sure, I understand that this is a game franchise that has tons of characters, many of which are carried over from previous games, with added history and character depth, but without modding it the character creation is ENTIRELY just a stat-adjuster for a ""Default"" character with a custom name.

Besides that, the UI felt too ""juicey / flashy"" , too new compared to the older simplified (yet nostalgic feeling) controls.

I've given it a few tries now, weeks apart, and for me, it just simply misses the mark somehow, even though all the right ingredients seem to be here. And yet:
- as nice looking as the maps are, it's surprisingly hard to read the map for good cover position and LOS
- the AI soldiers have a huge disregard for their own life. If you keep your mercs out of sight, the AI will run their guys right up  next to you to unload a desperate full auto salve. It's stupid because they die like flies but it still hurts having to patch up your mercs all the time.
- Most soldiers have way too many hitpoints and can withstand several direct hits to the face
- Combat distances on average feel shorter then in the original series, maybe another knock on the map design
- Most interactions, including the story lines, are wayy to kitsch and cartoonish, and while JA2 had some of that, too, JA3 lacks some of the genuine jokes and originality
- weapons simply don't feel different enough somehow, maybe because of the hitpoint sponges they are being used on

An uninspired game that even looses to it's own predecessor. If you really like this kind of games or are a fan of Jagged Alliance...wait for a massively discounted sale.

[b] Story [/b]
Same as always. Some fantasy country is having issues and hires mercs to achieve peace through superior firepower.

[b] Economy [/b]
As always holding certain tiles on the map generates money, in this case diamond mines. That brings the first new feature downgrade: shortly after ""liberating"" the mine you get a message, that the mine is drying up. Shortly after the mine's output drops of a cliff. This artificial time limit forces you to rush through the game or use the smallest merc force possible. Also money has no worth outside of paying mercs. JA2 allowed you to buy weapons, armor and ammo and have it delivered to the airport....JA3 has no shop. The closest you get is like a dozen NPC strewn across the map each selling 1 item every few days....

[b] Mercs [/b]
Downgrade #2.  There is a total of 36 mercs for hire, 9 of which are unavailable until later in the game. The cheap category has a meager 10 mercs to ""choose"" from. I say choose because there is only 1 explosive expert and only 2 medics there. Whenever you start a game a random amount of mercs will be unavailable for hire for a random time...if you are lucky there is neither expl. expert nor medic when you start.
Next downgrade: Skill tree. In itself a great idea. Every lvl up you get a point you can use to buy an ability. Problem here is that cheap mercs start at lvl1 or 2, allowing you to choose (almost) all perks.  Veterans like Magic or Gus start at lvl5-8  meaning most of their points are already used...and there is no way to reset it. So why would one hire them....

[b] Gameplay [/b]
Next downgrade please. JA2 offered vehicles to traverse..JA3 is walking only. The games stealth doesn't work at all. Enemies will see their allies dying through walls and mountains, or see someone dying behind them...Another issue is when you shoot an enemy with a supressed weapon and miss him by a mile...combat will still start because ""he got attacked"", no explanation given how he found out that a throwing knife or a silenced bullte just went 6meters above him... Also works in the other way. You shoot a guys head, the bullet penetraates and hits a wall right next to another enemy. That enemy is literally like""must have been the wind"".
Next Downgrade: they just had to steal the universally hated ""upon combat start all enemies get a free turn"" from XCom..why ? No idea..
Next downgrade: One of the JA games introduced the ability to queue up actions with different mercs to launch a coordinated attack like .. you know..professional mercs. Not in JA3....if there is 2 enemies then you have to shoot 1, then combat starts alerting all enemies with a free turn, then fight on....using 2 of your 6+ mercs to make a coordinated attack taking down both is too hi-tech for 2023.
This leads to the most boring and repetetive gameplay in recent years: You sneak around killing as many as possible with melee or silenced rifles (see difficulty below), which obviously only works on the few enemies who are alone with no other enemy within the same postal code. Then set all but 1 of your mercs into overwatch and have the 1 shoot an enemy. After that the enemies get their free turn and you pray that your overwatch gets something done...rinse and repeat. Amount of tactical or strategic options: none.
Next downgrade: when you disarm mines or other EOD you only get ""parts"". This includes mines you laid and want to reclaim.
Next downgrade ? Easy. In all other JA you could assign jobs to your merc (repair gear, heal wounded etc). In JA3 you hav to start an ""operation"". Each operation has a limited number of slots for performing mercs and a limited number of slots for targets. E.g. a max of 2 mercs can repair gear, the op has limited slots meaning only a fixed amount of gear can be added. Then you have to wait for the Op to finish. You cannot possibly have the same Op twice on the same map tile. E.G. you have 10 ""mechanics"" and want to repair your gear ? Well 2 ppl will repair while the other 8 watch...where the old JA allowed to have all mercs do repairs to finish in 1 day, here it's artificially timegated to stretch it out.

[b] Difficulty [/b]
None. AI is below the lvl of Ja1, which is a feat. Whatever difficulty exists is artificial. 
Mines drying up the moment you liberate them forces you to rush. 
No shop whatsoever forces you to work with whatever drops you get ...and droprates are abysmal. Out of 20 killed enemies you get an avg. of 1 weapon and 2 stacks of random ammunition. This forces you to be conservative...kill as much as possible with melee and throwing weapons. It also means rifles are the weapon of choice, followed by shotguns. Handguns deal too little dmg per round and automatic weapons are outright unsustainable. While you can craft ammo, it requires you to have gunpowder which is even rarer to find then ammo... (and only 1 guy can craft and you can only craft in very specific tiles)
Enemies usually come in packs. Including the aforementioned non existent stealth mechanics this leads to uncontrollable shootouts where you find yourself outnumbered most of the time.",1696097861,1696097861,False,96,10,0.593270957469940186,15,True,False,False

Granted, I have some mods installed to make the game more difficult. Mods that add a suppression system, tweak enemy combat AI, and add more enemies to each encounter. But with those mods installed, I find the game consistently challenging enough to never get stale.

And the amount of content here and the level of polish is incredible. Each tile on the overworld map is a unique tile-set to explore, often with unique events to be discovered or treasure/loot to be found. I particularly enjoy how enemy outposts have a strength rating that can be reduced by exploring and exploiting the surrounding territory.

For example, one enemy fort had a water well on a nearby tile, and I was able to set up an ambush for their soldiers as they came to draw water from this well. This ambush weakened the outpost, reducing the number of enemies I would face in my main assault.

The combat itself is extremely well done, with a multitude of unique abilities and weapons that allow you to customize your squad however you see fit. And the mercs are all hilarious. The subject matter of the game can get pretty dark, but the tone keeps it light and fun, in the style of a campy action movie from the 80s.

Each merc has their own attitude and voice actor, and most of them are a riot. On top of that, they each have a very powerful ability that makes them feel unique. I've been playing for about 25 hours now, and I've only just scratched the surface of what the different mercs can do and the sort of squads you can create.

Add to this a cool weapon mod system, where you can customize everything from a guns stock, scope, barrel, clip, grip, etc. and the game feels deep and engaging.

I've also played most attempts at a sequel in the last 20 years, and was at least mildly disappointed by them.

This game is good (with a very promising update roadmap at the time of this review). 

The only thing that I find subpar to JA2 is the combat, but that does not by any means mean it is not fun. To counteract that, the devs decided to not try to make a 3d carbon copy, and added many improvements on the on the 20 year old gameplay loop, and I appreciate all of them (the overview map in general, and especially the way operations are handled there, the whole intel system, the action-movie style story telling, making quests more prominent and better fleshed out, extending the economy to have more options than just controlling mines).

Just as a sidenote: since the combat gameplay went into a much more XCOM like direction, I don't just consider these improvements a step up from the JA2 gameplay loop, but they are also an improvement on the XCOM gameplay loop, and I would very much recommend this game to the fans of the XCOM series.",1696066030,1696066030,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

""The original Jagged Alliance games of the 1990s poked fun at cliches and stereotypes that existed in the action movies of the time. Jagged Alliance 3 continues this tradition, but also takes jabs at contemporary issues and pop culture.""

This immediately put me on guard. I don't want to play a game that's supposed to be the successor of something I've put 1000 hours in, that I love, that is stuffed with modern politics of ANY kind.

Then we get to the IMP character creator. Finally we have another JA game that has a character creator, after 20 fucking years. Except, you have an 8 character limit for your name and you have 3 portrait options for your character, for both genders. All this effort making a new IMP character generator, and your options are, black woman, white woman, blonde white woman, black dude, white dude with beret, and chinese dude. Wow. Incredible. Can't choose voices, can't choose clothing. You get what you get.

Get actually into the game, and the first combat encounter not only has no explanation for anything, but is my 3 mercs fighting 3 ""Goons"" by just shooting at each other from 10 feet away behind rocks like that scene from fucking Naked Gun 2 1/2 where Leslie Nielson is shooting at a dude 2 feet away from behind a trash can and missing, and the other dude is shooting back and missing. This is the tactical combat we were expecting?

What an embarrassment. Just let the series die already so we can stop getting our hopes up.

- JA2 is an incredibly high bar to beat.  JA2 was on many 'top 10 games of all time' lists.  JA3 is lacking a bit in terms of the grit of JA2, it's true, but not a lot.  There is a fairly chilling moment when they introduce gas attacks, which is effective and a little chilling.

Also, if you were triggered by XCOM2 claiming they didn't realise that the animations were incredibly slow, you're gonna still hate how even though JA3 is a little better (and a lot of the time, a whole enemy squad will reposition as one, instead of individually... they STILL have a stupidly slow bandage animation that you get to wait through, because apparently the same person who worked on XCOM also wanted you to masturbate to the sight of their incredible bandage animation here.

some wishlist;
character development/progression
- mercs can gain or lose perks / stats based on the activity the player does with it. like if the character uses smgs more he gets more proficient with it. 
- mercs which has affinity with another merc performs better if on the same team.
- mercs can also have negative affinity on another based on an experience like getting shot through friendly fire a lot of times.. etc..

tactical level
-  hoping the mercs would have the ability to make/fund their home base/fortress but they need materials to build it, design fortification. offering repair, rest and a place to launch an attack on another.
- several gangs/groups operating and can have their own base but depending on the economy level of their area.
- other sources of income like take a contract from a foreign actor undermining another group in the islands.
- politics between gangs, sort of a power struggle.
- create gang bosses subordinates that also gain experience and grow.. not eliminating the whole group even subordinates would allow the survivors to start again if not finished off.
- players can ally or fight them off.
- add other economic resource to fight for like oil.. and then some foreign groups allied with CIA haha!!

weapons and equipment
- more weapon updates should not only be about making the user shoot better, it should provide a strategic advantage. specially for those that are entrenched heavily. like a melee ai would only charge if someone from his team would throw a smoke grenade to cover their advance. or use of bomb or recon drones.
- access to backpacks to provide more items to carry but also consider weight. unless they have a cart that they carry around.. 
- lower chance of getting good loot if one died of explosion

Visuals
- when someone dies either from getting shot or stabbed, should vary.. if the limb gets blown off.. or if shot from a ledge the body falls.. if blown with grenade at least he gets flung or blast some pieces..
- changes the look when they wear armor.
- make the characters move and look more real. for me its about the experience of being a merc and what it feels to be on that situation.  

Animals
- they are ok but at times too imba.. hyenas dealt more damage to someone who is fully armored, probably it can at least at random temporary knock the person down while being attacked and unable to do other action unless the merc has enough melee skills to fight it or has handgun or until another shoots the animal.

Jagged Alliance 3 - Unpredictable Gameplay Hinders Strategy Planning

A key element in any tactical combat is knowing your chances of success or failure before taking action.

The ability to choose to shoot an enemy's head, arm, torso, or leg is a promising addition to the game, but without knowing the likelihood of hitting each body part, it becomes a mere guessing game. This mechanic could have offered tactical depth and decision-making variety if accompanied by proper feedback.

Also, the game's heavy focus on resource management feels out of place, burdening players with responsibilities they seek to avoid in their daily routines. While the tactical battles are not bad, but the constant resource juggling may deter those who crave pure tactical enjoyment. In short, they needs to ease up on resource management to offer a more straightforward, enjoyable experience.",1691311883,1695832151,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The nostalgia factor and expectations were very high with this one as you can imagine.

One of the biggest flaws and positive aspects of the game at the same time is how faithful to the original this game is with only a few improvements and many outdated and, quite frankly annoying, mechanics.

Thankfully it's not a simple remake as you get a new country to free from a [put a cliche trait] villain.

Combat is very neat with quite a few possible ways of approaching each encounter. If you really want to dig deep, you can pick a time of day to improve your chances especially if you have night vision goggles. You can also count on the weather to level the playing field. Being stealthy or explosive are also options. Everything is valid. You can even kill all your enemies with machetes/knives if you fancy (there are multiple achievs for that). AI is pretty decent and only occasionally makes idiotic mistakes for your benefit. The recruits you train are painfully dumb, but veterans and elite soldier are quite lethal, so that adds up.

In the original aiming always felt even more random than xcom, but it surely makes more sense now. It seems to be a die roll relying on marksmanship, weapon range and its modifications, time of day, weather conditions and the cover taken by the enemy. Sand storm will make it very hard to do proper damage and rain will make your weapon jam more often - both make real impact on the battlefield.

There are a few memorable grids with terrain or structures putting you on your toes and rethinking your approach. Every time I grew too comfortable the game had a curve ball right around the corner. This factor made it a lot more engaging.

Resources are just on the level of sufficient once you get past first 10 hours which can be a struggle. It makes sense the weapon store from the original game is gone, however, it's coming with a patch soon.

What definitely doesn't work is the humour, the level of cringe and pastiche can be unbearable. The writers had no ambition of updating the dialogues and jokes. If you are very PC, turn off the volume. You have misogyny, racism, nationalism, sexism - all the isms really. One particular dialogue between Wolf and Fox will leave you traumatized for life. Ironically, this problem makes it feel like your mercs are real people and I cared about them more than I ever could for any soldier in xcom for example.

Paying for contracts is the same as the original - lots of clicking which could have been automated in this dasy and age. Backtracking to take over control of areas you lost along the way can be a pain, but it's part of the game's charm as well. Healing, resting, r&r and repairing your equipment might be a hassle too, but at least it has impact on your combat abilities, so it's worth doing.

One big difference is the amount of side missions and people you can talk to. Most side stuff is really not worth it, but you get an occasional surprise and they are all optional.

Is there a plot? Yeah, I guess, but it's paper thin. You won't care for it.

With rich tactical combat, solid visuals and amount of battles to go through it's really good competition for xcom. It is by no means flawless, but the original never was either and that is part of its charm. Once you overlook the bad you will notice plenty of good to enjoy.",1695678585,1695764426,True,37,2,0.706885278224945068,0,True,False,False

There are a few minor annoyances like only a few items going in the squad inventory and not very clear indication what kind of ammo you've loaded into your guns, but many of these minor issues have already been fixed by modders and may be fixed in the future by the devs. Because these devs clearly care about their players and their game.

I barely played the first one because I loved Deadly Games for being able to make my own maps and campaigns that my Old man and I would play and I would play the maps he made.

When Jagged Alliance 2 came out our PC would barely run it. The bullets were so slow and took forever to hot or miss. It did not matter we still had fun and far more fun when we got a PC that actually ran it. 

I knew after playing this game there would be people who played JA2 1.13 and would not give this a positive review and I as well played that mod and loved it. However, that mod has been around for a long time and updated throughout it's many years. I think some these guys forgot the game did not come with this mod and their expectations were far to high.

I have enjoyed my many hours of this game and look forward to more especially now that the modding community is getting more and more options with the updates the developers are releasing. We may have this games version of JA2 1.13 soon if not already. 

The developers have captured the spirit of the Jagged Alliance series with it's funny dialogue and interaction between the characters. 

The game has had it's issues but nothing game breaking. They patch a lot and seem to listen to the community. I quit one of my play through because after an update my IMP Merc's stats were all very low, single digits, but that's possible because of mods I had. I just started a new play through even though I was close to the end of the game, but I had already beaten it before.

Honestly my gripes are minor and maybe nit picking. Some of the AIM merc's voices I did not care for but others I got use to and liked compared to JA2, for example Wolf. However, it grew on me and I like it. Magic however, is just not the same and I do not care for his look nor Reapers or Grunty's. They are wearing suits in a Jungle and while I know the game is not the most realistic it just kind of killed the immersion a bit for me. I understand if others are okay and like it so it's not game breaking. Still, Magic's voice is so different, he does not have that rough gruff and yet cool voice he had back in JA2. I understand a lot of these voice actors are not available and some have passed on but still, I feel someone close to that voice could have been used. 

I would like to see an option to pick a preset look for characters. For example Reaper wears a dark suit but perhaps there could be an option to choose an outfit that is more tactical, with a tactical vest similar to wolf or Grizzly for those players who prefer there characters look like that. Still, it's far better than the blue shirts they wore in JA and limited colored shirts in JA2. 

Some more options for the IMP mercs would have been nice at realease but the modding community has added many customization options and will continue to make more. 

I give major props to the developers giving modding rights to the community and that they are continuing to give more with their updates. This game has a lot of replay-ability and look for to putting another 200 hours into it.",1695290894,1695290894,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The developers and designers obviously studied Firaxis's successful streamlined reboot of the X-COM games and took the best parts when modernizing Jagged Alliance, while being mindful to not simplify things *too* much; e.g. Action Points are still a thing, as opposed to XCOM reducing every turn to one move + one gunshot.

Just about every drawback (with respect to JA2's design and complexity) has a positive tradeoff. Yes, the tactical maps are smaller, but is more than made up by the variety of situations created by the 3D elevated battleground. The writing and wit is not as sharp, but there's a lot more dialogue (e.g. interactions between mercs) and a lot more twists in the sidequests than ever found in JA2.

This was a pretty easy recommend based on how hooked I was playing JA3 at launch. The gameplay felt great even though it felt like a game that was still a couple months from leaving early access. Now that it's been a few months, it's been great to see the developers continue to interact with players and solicit feedback for substantial patches and improvements. If JA3 doesn't make as many sales as it deserves to, it's only because it had the misfortune to release the same time as Baldur's Gate 3, another revamp of a highly beloved isometric tactical adventure from the late 90s era.",1689526970,1695224238,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are many different mercs to choose from and many ways to execute your mission. Lots of side missions to explore with many interesting characters. I beat the campaign in about 30 hours with my friend in CO-OP mode on the hardest difficulty, and the game could use more balancing as the most challenging difficulty wasn't that hard, we did get quite a bad ending though. Overwatch can be a tad OP, we would wipe out entire squads sometimes because enemies would not utilize cover at all and would just run into our cones all the time. Most missions ended with just overwatch cones with some of my mercs never having to fire their weapon except for one or two that had machine guns, there should be more exciting battles. I cannot wait for the DLC, I will buy it if the devs are planning one. The developer is also adding free content through updates, they soon plan to add an online gun store where your mercs can buy guns instead of having to loot them, which will be included in a free update! I wish this game had a 4-player CO-OP, which unfortunately isn't a feature, so my other buddy that we usually play with could not do a campaign with us. Hopefully, the devs add a four-player CO-OP in the future. Definitely buy, its like XCOM but with mercenaries taking place in the late 90s.

 I like the Gameplay and the strategic map part. Has also nice little things, e.g. when the Soldiers bitch or praise each other, many little jokes in the world and sectors.

What i do not like some smaller things e.g. the enemies are not that smart and usually just rush you after combat starts. There is some room for improvement there or item management is a bit cumbersome, sector inventoty is not sorted or automatically stacked ... but these are small things and i hope thy get fixed in future updates (or i just grab a mod)

The engine is not suited for turn based tactics shooter. It's ""too 3D"" making positioning and cover impossible to judge by looking at it. Half height cover is the worst. You can shoot over some examples just by standing, over some by crouching and over some even when being prone and shooting a level below you! And then there's examples when you can't shoot over it at all. In some cases even the game can't tell. It will tell you that you have a line of sight but you will keep shooting the cover. 

All of this is hard to explain in words but trust me, you can only position by trial and error with save and load. This ruins the fun and I don't think it's fixable by any patching ever. They should have used a simplified terrain and objects where everything is multiples of 1m height so you know what cover you get just by looking at it. Xcom 2 does this.

All of the other annoying things can be patched and maybe they will considering the game has had some success. For me so far these are: bad inventory system, enemies having full APs and aim even when ""nearly dead"", lack of weapons shop, some intractable  things being hard to click, having left click move in combat but right click out of it.

But for a conclusion the game is not fun because you can not plan ahead, you can only save scum to win, so I can not recommend it. I am uninstalling it for now, maybe will check back in a year.",1694521190,1694521190,False,4,1,0.473102390766143799,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Has Ivan
- Huge diverse yet detailed world
- Chars have stories and background
- Generally well balanced
- Decent side quests
- I found the story to be pretty interesting. SPOILER: [spoiler] That moment when military enters the game and retakes half of your cites was genunely fresh and unexpected from this game [/spoiler]
- Balance is OK: unlike many other players I would not say this game favors snioers too much
- Well tested, bugs are too rare to ruin the playthrough
- Some songs from the soundrack are really interesting to listen, especially with ethnic motives

Cons:
- The combat is way too similar to Wasteland 3 and XCOM. The genre dires for some innovation here
- The combat itself is a bit too repetitive
- After conquering 2 mines, you stop worrying about money for the rest of the game (this however plagues my playthroughs of any RPG. so take it with a grain of salt)

Other considerations:
- Hit and miss humour: this game parodies the movies in 90s so it is kind of an acquired taste. There is lot of national stereotype play, sexist-ish and just dirty jokes. If you are offended by this stuff you better surf Twitter rather then playing this game
- Despite having a ton of different voice actors, no catchy phrases like in previous installation. ""Elliot, you idiot"", ""Time to take out the trash"", ""I ate all the bugs on the way, there were many"": these are just memories now :(

[b] Pros: [/b] 
- Settings: Mercenaries, dictators, Africa, jungle guerrilla, blood diamond... If any of those sound appealing then you're going to have a great time with this game. This game does dawdle in some very adult topics (genocide, etc...)  which I think adds to the setting, despite the parodying aspect of the game. 

-Environment and graphics: There's day and night cycle, as well as weather effects that can affect combat. Most of everything are destructible during combat and can create opportunities. Animations are smooth AF, with characters sliding into cover, launch rockets, scream profanities at the enemies, etc... Enemies will explode into showers of blood and guts, heads will pop, bullets ricochets, etc... It's a symphony of grand destruction in RPG form, it's dirty and chaotic and unpredictable. 

-- Characters: This is probably one of the strongest parts of the game. On the surface it might seems like childish humor (considering that it is supposed to be parodying contemporary culture) but I think it's done very well. EVERY character (except your I.M.P custom merc) has a different personality and dialogues, and they can clash with each other and affect the game. Mercs will straight up refuse to work for you if there's somebody they dislike who's already on the team, or will charge you extra. There's a supermodel you can hire as a merc and if you have angrier Ronda Rousey with guns on the team as well, they will constantly sass each other. There's a merc named Larry who is basically a hippie and constantly on drugs and somehow good at handling explosives, and he will have some of the most hilarious dialogs in the game. Arnold is in this game as well. The NPCs are also very unique, and most of them have very memorable quests which can have a butterfly effect to the rest of the game.  

- Mercenary management: Mostly done well. You hire mercs off an early 90s-style website, like a Soldier of Fortune magazine ad. You set a timeline for their service, pay ahead of time as well as medical bills, then they set sail to your determined destinations. Each mercs have specialities (medic, sharpshooter, mechanic, leader, etc...) and you assign them to tasks (Fixing weapons, patching up the wounded, training militia, scouting, even prospecting for diamonds.)

- Gameplay: XCOM + Commando + Shadows tactics. You go around taking outposts, villages, diamond mines. You can also set up ambushes to steal diamond or weapon shipments. and there are tons of unique and fun sidequests to undertake. Each square can be explored (and highly recommended) for medical herbs as well as side quests, treasures, intel and loot. In combat, you can stealth (to a certain extent) but usually it is about finding a holdout spot and dwindle down the enemies. Certain scenario requires more tactical thinking (bomb defusing or standoffs) which forces everyone to work together, which adds variety to the game. The guns (which includes mortars, explosives and RPG) feel and sound great, with a large variety of guns and ammo type, and mods (WW1, WW2, Warsaw pact, NATO) so it really feels like a mercenary simulation using whatever you can get your hands on. 

[b] Cons: [/b] 
- UI: Worst UI i have ever seen in a RPG turn based strategy, especially on the overmap. Literally none of it is intuitive and messy. You will constantly misclick and travel for no reason or to the wrong sector, accidentally cancelling or starting tasks. The overmap pause button is also terribly done since by default it is always unpaused so it makes it extremely difficult to sync squad attacks since you can only control one squad at a time and there's no option to select multiple squads. In the inventory if you hover the guns description it will then completely block the ammo screen which then you have no idea which guns use what ammo and how much you have left. 

- Squad/character placement: Jesus fucking christ. As mentioned before it is almost impossible to sync squads attack even if everyone was moving from the same square. And when you move a squad, keep in mind that if let to their own accords, your mercenaries will LITERALLY pick the path with MOST resistance and trying to cross as much enemy territory as possible, even if the path takes a lot more time and they have to backtrack (I'm not joking, this is a feature not a bug), so you will have to constantly micromanage because one wrong move can cost you a lot if you don't save often. 
- Setting up ambushes is very difficult, even in a sector that you control and is on the defensive. My team has been chilling in a sector for the last 72 hours KNOWING the enemy is coming, but when the enemy attacks it's like my team have never seen this place before and spent the last 72 hours jerking off. There's only ONE deployment spot for a map (which makes no sense for a defensive situation) and usually it's tiny. So you have to deploy everyone at the same tiny-ass spot then haul-ass to their ambush spot, but usually you run into the enemy before you can even set up. This doesn't make any sense. 

-Friendly AIs: You spend a lot of in-game time training militia to protect villages and outposts. But when the place is attacked they walk around like they're enjoying an evening at the garden, usually by themselves and then bump into the enemy and screw up your already difficult job trying to set up ambushes. They also have no sense of self-preservation and will rush by themselves into machine gun fire, or taking cover behind a rock half a mile away from the fight. But the silver lining is that elite militia and some characters are very  capable of defending themselves and taking down the enemy. There's a granny in this game that can headshot goons outside of her house that is separated by two walls through a windows with an MG42. 

-Stealth and combat: There are definitely the worsts of XCOM DNA here. Stealth BARELY works. You can headshot a guy with a silenced pistol and somehow the sniper on the 5th floor heard ""Someone screaming in pain."" and alerted the entire base. There's no current way to sync up stealth kills unless you play multiplayer, but if you shoot a goon, the guy next to him usually enters ""Surprised mode"" which then you can shoot that guy as well. 
- Like XCOM, the ""99% hit chance miss"" and other bullshit are here as well, which brought me to the last pro of the game.

[b] Last Pro: [/b] 
- SAVE SCUM: Do yourself a favor and save scum, it is the best way to enjoy the game, that is unless you're a masochist who enjoy restarting the entire game every other hour because your shotgunner missed a 99% chance shot and let a grenadier kill everyone in your squad. Also the game has those beautiful and cathartic headshot moments, or exploding 5 goons at once for the first time using an RPG which you can only achieve if you save-scum due to the stupid hit-chance, and other bullshit anti-fun mechanics. There's a weird anti-savescum mechanic which accelerates the enemies' turn if you reload, but it can be easily bypassed by just waiting a few seconds before entering the loaded game. Screw what the others think about save-scumming, you're a merc, fighting fair is always looked down upon.

A little more details: 
For a while I waited for a discount, and eventually bought the game full price. 
Right now i'm so happy I paid full price, as the developers really deserve my money. It's totally worth it.

For years I repeatedly played JA2, and this game supersedes it! 
It's like JA2 with quality of life improvements, better graphics ,mechanics, and a well thought of story. 

The battle can be extremely challenging,  I initially went to a wrong area in the map (too early) and saved and loaded 300 times until I realized I couldn't do it (playing on experienced normal difficulty).

Battles are hard and fun, mercenary characters are varied and very well developed, a great variety of weapons, scenery keeps changing and surprising, money handling is sophisticated and great fun.

Once you learn this game you really can't stop playing. I give this piece a 10 / 10.

Took me 70 hours to complete the campaign and I still missed a few things. There is lots of quality content.

Many mercenaries from previus games are here with their own unique abilities, skills and personalities. There is also a nice selection of weapons and modifications to play with. It feels familiar and nostalgic, but at the same time fresh and new. 

The country of Grand Chien is also quite big. There's plenty of side stories, missions and events going on and it feels like a real country with real people and real problems. Problems you can choose to solve in different ways or simply ignore and focus on your job. 

Sadly its not perfect. Most maps are tiny with barely any tactical options. Its easy to aggro the entire map, specially early game, when you don't have long range silenced weapons. The tactics haven't evolved beyond corner camping and overwatch traps. I also miss the pause system from JA BiA where you could execute multiple orders at once. But the devs patched in a simple pause system, so much respect for listening to the players feedback!

Overall an enjoyable game, although not without flaws which make me wish there was a ""neutral"" option on Steam. After finishing, I guess I'm still mildly leaning towards ""recommend"".
I liked the characters and got a good nostalgia kick out of assembling the favorite squad.
Good number of funny lines from your mercs and banter. Characters definitely have personality.
Many quests and genuinely interesting storylines that have just right amount of things to do without pulling too much of your attention.
Quests have multiple outcomes and effects on your team.
It definitely feels like a JA game, at least in terms of world building. Somewhat less so in terms of combat, unfortunately.

- UI is horrible. Lost count how many times I looted someone or closed a door because I wanted to move close to one of those triggers. Some mods are already not just QoL but indispensable, unless you want surprise tired mercs when arriving to battle or surprise traps that you can't tell if they are mechanical or explosive.
- Camera controls are pretty bad. On maps with multiple levels, you have to fight to keep it on the ground level if you scroll around. Underground maps can be tricky to move around if a camera doesn't want to rotate because it hits the map's border
- Mercs walk over detected landmines
- Endless attack/shipment squad spam that goes through the same chokepoint on the map, eventually grinding down your militia and forcing you to keep people on guard duty or lose a settlement or rush outposts
- Overall diversity of the map: Arulco was cool because you got really poor towns but gradually things got more civilized as you got closer to Meduna. You even had filthy rich towns like Balime. Here it's just one sh*thole village/spooky jungle sector after another. Once I had 2 full squads of really good mercs and decent equipment, I just rushed endgame because the thought of repelling more attack squads/doing 20 more jungle fights was not very amusing.
- That leads us to: game feels like it overstays it's welcome, but maybe it just gets repetitive [spoiler], perhaps because of the world flip that forces you to recapture the first half of the map all over.[/spoiler] 
- Like many have noted, damage system and overall balance need work. I had a guy shrug off a headshot from .50bmg. Not only that, because taking damage doesn't influence character's movement/accuracy/etc, he can run a bunch and fire back you next turn.
Now, overall sniper rifle domination that others complain about is actually pretty true to JA2. Closer to endgame there your entire squad would have FN-FAL with optics and just sneak around laying headshots. This game feels very similar in that regard. But in JA2 you were able to get close, unload a full auto and have the enemy fly through the air spectacularly, blood splatters and all. And don't even get me started on point blank shotguns.
- Training system that doesn't make sense. You learn almost nothing in combat but get tons of experience from practicing with a trainer. I put not a whole lot in marksmanship of my IMP because in JA2 you level it really fast by shooting lots. That did not work out so well.
- RNG: mercs with 98 marksmanship missing point blank shots because I guess they sneezed or something? In general, there's absolutely no motivation to push because being next to an enemy doesn't mean you'll hit. You'd think a game would reward you for taking risks like that.
- Crafting and inventory management: others said a lot about it

Yeah, I guess a lot of frustration amassed during the playthrough. I guess much of it will be fixed with patches and mods, and eventually it'll be a fairly solid experience.",1694098586,1694098586,True,1,0,0.502989530563354492,0,True,False,False

Definitely one of the best games of 2023 and one of my favorites in a long time. It's a MUST if you like tactical games like X-com, Silent Storm and others.
It's not so easy at the beginning with the controls, UI, and gameplay difficulty but after some trial and error and understanding how everything works it's so much fun and it's a very rewarding experience.
The best description from me of this game is that it feels old school in the best way possible (with a few downsides but nothing that will ruin your experience). The core tactical gameplay is great and feels so much better than the latest X-Coms in comparison. The gameplay on the global map is interesting enough and not pushing too hard on you.
The characters and humor are one of the best aspects of this game. I don't remember when last time I actually laughed so much in a game or cared for my own soldiers.

I was also pleased when I came across some of the conflict/friendship audio clips - so those start to emerge (logically) as you have more mercs/possibilities for different combinations.

There are two minor things I have noted... one is location specific and the other is global. ""The Good Place"" required an extensive search in turn-based mode and that really caused that sector to drag badly. I have not completed the game, but have not had this issue arise in other sectors. Globally sometimes it is hard for characters to interact with a highlighted item (I eventually gave up on trying to access a loot item in one sector because I could not activate it). These are MINOR items IMO.

Handling ammo constraints is a TOUGH part of this game, but again, I have found that to be a logical challenge as you drop your mercs in with their load out...you are remote and not everything is available off the shelf (feeling a little Uncommon Valor vibes there).

Alliance 3. I say this as somewhat of a veteran of XCOM-2 who attempted several hundred no-death runs.

JA3 is, for lack of a better word, beautiful-ugly. I've encountered several light bugs that do interfere with one or two save files, but that should only really bother you if a) you savescum like I do because you want to get up and make a cup of coffee, and/or b) you haven't got back-ups of other save files to 'timeline' differently. So, many of these little niggling bugs (like the one where you can read a skill book for one champ to infinity and beyond) almost feel like... easter eggs. It's kind of nice to play such a polished game where... you scratch
it here and there and you can see how thin the veneer is in some places.

In some places, only; particularly the stealth mechanics, which I'll get to later.

The rest of the game is pretty solid in terms of tacticity. The enemies are no pushovers at the normal difficulty. They'll outflank you and out-damage you if you misplace your champs, and your champs aren't
that good at finishing off enemies in one shot, either. Early game is a mix between taking hits and dishing
out pain long enough to last from turn to turn - midgame, which is where I'm writing this review, needs you
to scavenge decent equipment, mod it with a decent mechanic-champ, and then set up killzones and choke
points in order to box the enemy into confinement. The sheer variety of weapons and mods and grenades
that you can apply all have their uses - flashbangs and tear gas are fantastic in a pinch, especially when, and
because, you're outnumbered. Actually, grenades in general are a great way to start fights when the enemy
is bulked together, but they don't guarantee a 4-man clear, just enough damage to make everyone squishy.

The combat itself, if you've never played X-COM, takes place in two phases - the undetected phase, which
lets you RTS your way through a map, and the grid. The grid limits your capacity to move and conduct actions via points, which is stock-standard of most table-top inspired games like this. The RTS component...
Well... that leaves the most to be desired. It's no 'Commandos 2' in terms of stealthing your way to victory. I haven't got the reflexes these day to handle multi-tasking three champs in order to try a simultaneous
take down of enemies, either (you'd have to be some kind of god to execute it perfectly, too), because... the game does not have a very good 'bullet time' mechanic that allows you to pause/unpause the real time action. Everything happens in real time. And when you're stealthing, this seems like freedom until you shoot somebody and somehow 'alert' somebody you couldn't see, or the bullet ricochets off of something, and 'alerts' somebody far away. And then the grid pops up, even though you might be hidden, and it's back to the core mechanic gameplay. So, I do not like the 'stealthy' RTS aspect because I cannot actually click things fast enough (or deal enough damage) in order to 'silently' remove enough opponents, or the whole map this way.

So I guess it sounds like I'm complaining and don't really like this game? No. Not at all. The champs are fantastic, the setting is something straight out of 1980s Predator - and the game knows this. The voice acting is top notch, the quips from champs are idiosyncratic, and they even respond to each other (having likes and dislikes, disliking and liking other champs). The knock-off Arnold Schwarzenegger character is... brilliant. The ditzy 'blonde' type plays into the objectification trope so well. Whoever thought Rambo should've been a South African send-up of Tropic Thunder is a comic genius. It's these little things that really, really do outshine any of the technical problems that - from a game which offers you so much variety and freedom where it can, doesn't need online play, no account sign-up, no microtransaction bullshit, nothing but the game out the box, thank fucking christ a game like this exists, and what a time to be alive.

Good luck, son, and godspeed you on your way.

This is a solid tactical turn-based game, on top of a credible physics engine that I have seen handle a few dozen NPCs moving around shooting, running, climbing stairs, blowing up walls, etc. with no crashes, hitches or weird things. I say ""credible"" because obviously ballistics are somewhat simplified or made easy, but this is a technically very solid piece of gaming software. It is so well-engineered that the mod support is super deep and I am pretty sure that folks over the years will ""overhaul"" this and that system to deliver very hardcore experiences.

And, most importantly, also plays just GREAT. It is very interesting that the solid simulation, in an emergent fashion it seems, brought about a pretty interesting stealth mechanics. It does bring it to a weird unexplored place firmly somewhere in between X-COM, JA2 and Commandos/Mimimi games. The tactical AI is decent even if it does use a X-COM relocation phase as side wheels. I must admit that given the tools at the disposal of the player, if Haemimont designers hadn't introduced that, we would be ROFLstomping the AI more often than it would be good for the fun of the game.

140+ hours filled with nostalgia, a sense of accomplishment and most of all.. fun! 

PROS: 
-True to the core elements of JA1, JA2
-Overall story is a bit cliche but executed nicely with some surprises. 
-Great soundtrack that really fits well with what's going on. 
-Amazing attention to detail. The island really feels tropical and jungle-like.
-Characters are well written and voice-acted to perfection, especially the local NPCs.
-You can feel a constant sense of progression when the character stats increase.

CONS:
-The cellphone hack item is so tiny I constantly find myself fighting with camera angles/zoom.
-Some awkward pacing, especially with the '2nd part' of the Refugee camp storyline.
-Some minor bugs here and there. 
-Inventory screen could be a bit more lively and 'interactive'. Would love to see a visual representation of the character holding the current gun, for example.

As with all recent games it suffers from ""dumbification/consolization"" - just like XCom games did. In case of xcom, from games that had some tactical/strategical development/game play, those titles were reduced in this dimensions, ie, economy is gone, tactical gameplay revolves around triggering small groups of enemies, etc etc.
JA3 suffers from this as well. Economy - gone, granted it was limited, but it was there, you could sell items. In this one, its reduced to valuables. Reduced to scrap that you get from weapons/gear.
Traders - limited to undesirable items most of the time, no airfield that would be siginificant target/resource to fly in eq.

Map - smaller.

Bugs. It is bugged quit significantly, most annoying so far:
 - Better squads after event can see your troops even when they are sneaking, essentially you can end up triggering enemies just so you hidden troops will be shelled with 40mm....
 - Enemy trigger makes them invulnerable - if you sneak up on enemies and shoot or get detected you will get animation of one enemy shooting in the air - notifying other that you are here. Thing is, if you open up on them with mortar, only first round out of 4 will register as hit...
 - hardcoded ""enemy heard a shot"" detection. Normaly, if you are sneaking and have silenced weapon enemies will be able to detect you when you shoot close to them( ie, through wall ....) or when they hear someone die or see them. But in some cases you can shoot from like 20m and still get ""enemy heard shot""
 - enemies can hear silenced weapons through wall.
 - ammo - you cant produce it unless you find scarce resource( powder at the least) + scrap + whatever. The problem is - you cant scrap ammo you have.
 - squad ammo/scrap intentory is picky, you can store ammo, meds( for medkits), 40mm, mortar, but components like gunpowder, pipe, chip, lens etc... nope... WTF?",1693326798,1693328076,False,84,6,0.642844021320343018,2,True,False,False

this is a much different game to JA2, item/inventory management is super simple now, turn based combat has walked away from its roots and is much more like xcom, seems to be less in regards to inter squad mingling/fighting between characters although that might just be the mercs i picked.

needs more guns... seriously i don't care if they are unlikely to be in the country, every JA game needs every known type of firearm in existance!

also whats the go with no bobby rays? seriously make that happen.

Easter eggs and pop culture references galore! devs really had fun with this one, also super glad they didn't censor themselves to appeal to a more modern audience... devs get a thumbs up just on that front in my view.

if i had no knowledge of the franchise and played this as my first JA game i reckon id be pretty happy with it as it is a good game 

i feel like OG JA2 fans might find themselves wanting with this game, as a lot of the micromanagement and freedom is gone (i really felt like it was possible to do anything in JA2 when i played it some 20 years ago, which blew my mind at the time)

$3mil in the bank, the game balance is purposely unforgiving making players to choose a Sneaky Sniper and Overwatch play style in the beginning. 

However, after players figure out the special attack system and required perks, the game opens up to a Loud & Proud play style. Run & Gun, SMGs and shotguns are now making the game extremely fun to enjoy.

$300k in the bank, hired 8 mercs and 3 free mercs, about one third in the game now, no mods installed, doing the side missions as i go, and fighting every militia battle. It's been a hard slog, but the PMC company is profitable, and the mercs are fun to hang out with along the journey.

1. Field experience: sorry but this system is just really really bad as it is, oops you just got hit and gained a point in health so you cant raise your MM until you kill some more enemies and pray you get lucky and not accidentally level another useless stat again.

2. Training: while FE is bad and mostly useless training is the exact opposite, its gamebreaking OP

3. RNG containers and drops: this one swings so wildly it makes the game really frustrating at times. You can find dozens of bullets randomly on an enemy solving your ammunition problems or nothing. You can find 2 large diamonds worth thousands or a single flare

Grenades/rockets can't be aimed properly, because the cursor keeps re-snapping to whatever (but I have no idea to what). 

trying to hack a small phone? You'd better get really patient, because hitting just the right spot where you can do it, is a pain.

I was thinking about why I enjoy it so much, and I came to the conclusion that the reason is that every moment is high stakes. At every single moment you have a lot to lose, and every round is tense.
And losses really hurt and will throw you back and might jeopardize your campaign. 
And of course you can save scum and get around that - but honestly, why would you? Every bullet one of your guys takes is a huge setback that makes the game so much more interesting. So I suggest keeping reloading to a minimum.
Now a lot of games can be tense. For example XCOM 2. I assume if you play this game, you know about XCOM. But with Firaxis XCOM2, the tenseness feels so artificial. The game just says: You have 7 rounds to achieve this objective, now rush you men and throw strategy into the wind. That part never sat right with me, and I think Jagged Alliance 3 has a much more organic approach.

Jagged Alliance gives you money, and with that money you can hire mercenaries. And when you run out of money, then mercenaries do not get paid, and that is pretty much when they leave. And Mercs get paid on a per day level. This means that the game plays on two timescales: The strategic timescale, which is active on the strategic map, and the tactical timescale, which is active in battles.

So on the strategic map, where hours and days go by when you forward time, your Mercs rest, repair their equipment, go in Bars, heal their wounds or train with their colleagues. You can also order them to travel to different parts on the island, both in groups or alone. The opposing force basically does the same, and typically it comes to confrontation when they move their forces in your territory or the other way around.

At that moment the game switches to the tactical view. Now the game basically becomes turn based, and the view is zoomed into a small section of the whole map, called a sector. There is no artificial time pressure in the shoot out that follows. You can crawl, sneak and position your mercenaries to your hearts content. Look for cover in a highly destructable environment. 

But if one of your mercs gets hurt, they will later have to rest. And one bad bullet may delay all of your later operations, or you have to leave someone behind. But you only have few mercenaries, this is a small squad game. You typically have a sniper, a shotgun guy, maybe someone with an assault rifle. And an explosive expert, a medic, and that's pretty much it. So leaving your sniper behind because they took a bullet in the butt will seriously weaken your whole team.

I didn't go into all the other stuff that goes on top, like the weapon customization, equipment slots, mercenary personalities and the many quests with consequences and different outcomes.

I haven't finished the game yet, but I am already 30 hours in.

* Graphics: 8/10 (even close up, all looks good, i'll knock a little off because it's maybe a bit more demanding on a system than it could be)

* Voices 10/10: Incredible number of really good voice actors were used. There's a heck of a lot of speech recorded in this game!

* Sound: 8/10 (Great guns sounds and ambience, only knocking it down about because of some stuttering that I only get with this and another title by same developers, Stranded: Alien Dawn).

* Music: Great variety of African themed and generally JA appropriate music.

* Story: Excellent writing under the direction of Ian Currie the original creator of the franchise. A lot of pop culture references to the late 90's/early 0'ties. Older audiences will appreciate more but some great humour in the mix.

* Replayability:  After 289 hours and 6 attempts I have finally finished a playthrough (which itself took 71 hours), and I still want MORE!!

* Modding: Excellent mods support - Already nearly 300 mods on the workshop already and that's before they just released an official mod editor!

- There's no sight lines, so its not clear what the weapon ranges are, or the accuracy. It just seems like the enemy can hit you from across the map, and your shots just whiff, regardless of putting all your AP into aiming. There's also a stealth mechanic, but silent takedowns miss even when sneaking up on people. It's also not clear how stealth works, since sometimes they just see you, and sometimes they don't. One silent takedown I did get to work caused the enemy squad to get alerted anyways, where they get a whole ""preposition"" phase to manuever, and it just left my sneaky knife guy standing out in the open next to his kill. He was downed the next turn.

- The obstruction mechanic is the worst. Basically, if an enemy is ""obstructed"" you can't hit them. In the battle I quit on, they were hidden in fog, unable to be hit while I had a ambush set up from above and the flanks. They could hit me with full on machine gun fire from across the map, but no matter where I moved, they were obstructed by fog and I couldn't target anyone. Even when they were facing away from me, literally right below my elevated position. They weren't even bothering with cover, standing out in the open, but not able to be hit or even targeted. If the fog is bulletproof, why are they able to see and shoot through it?

- Elevation and cover doesn't seem to make a difference, or does it? There's no indicators for chance to hit, max AP aim misses, and I ate machine gun bursts behind full cover, and whiffed melee attacks or headshots next to enemies. You're worse off in elevation, since your line of sight gets blocked trying to shoot down at someone behind half cover, which gives them obstructed status. But they can hit you fine. Why?

- Flanking. It says there's a flanking mechanic, but how does it work? What does it do? It didn't seem to make any difference  when I had people surrounded.

- What do the character stats do? I gave the sniper rifle to the guy with the highest marksmanship, who couldn't hit sh*t with it. So I gave it to the guy with 20 less marksmanship who could hit sh*t, who also happened to be sneaky knife guy. Sneaky knife guy kept whiffing knife attacks, so there you go, you're a sniper now.

- There's free aim, but it doesn't work. Unlike Phoenix Point, the free aim doesn't go to a first person target reticle, instead you just click the area you want to shoot into. But going back to the fog fight, you can't hit anything obstructed or ""hidden"". I.e., you can't hit anything you wouldn't already be able to hit without free aim, so what's the point?

Overall there's just missing information and options for a tactical game. I found the most effective strategy was simply to Leroy Jenkins straight at the enemy with the whole squad in line, spam grenades and focus one down at a time. Playing tactically with overwatch and maneuver elements just got my people downed or unable to hit anything. As much as I don't like XCOM or Phoenix Point's ""hurry the f*ck up"" time based missions, those are both better options. Or Wasteland 3, Hard West 2, or literally any other tactical turn based shooter.",1692764853,1692764973,False,7,2,0.523930549621582031,0,True,False,False

The Game is a Mixture of Turn Based Combat Like X-Com. The Exploration of the fictional country of Grand Chien, with its residents, stories and their various quests that often interact with one another. A Tactical layer, where you do things like repairing items, securing the ground you took by training militia or moving your mercanaries through Grand Chien. And last but not least the mercanaries themselve, who are sort of the lead actors of this game. Each mercanary is pretty unique, has likes and dislikes, has its own voice lines and unique interactions with other mercs or Grand Chien in general.

The Game Mechanics are quite punishing, in a good way (most of the time), you know when you made a wrong move. The game is significantly more easy than hardcore mods like Jagged Alliance 2 1.13, but I dont think this is what the developers was aiming for. The game has really good mod support and I am sure it's only a matter of time until a mod similar to 1.13 or The Long War for X-Com comes out, although that might take a while.

The balance between Combat, Strategy and Exploration of the island is engaging and seems to merit more than one playthrough. For a game of its complexity Jagged Alliance 3 is in a good state, I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs so far. Although there are still some things here and there that need to be patched. To the Developers credit, most of the bugs I encountered so far seem to be patched with the newest version of the game.

So far so good, but not everything is perfect. The combat seems to be a bit unbalanced over all. There are some abilities that seem a little overpowered. Using Overwatch or sneaking can make the game very easy, once you know what you are doing. But even if you don't put hundreds of hours into this game the difficulty curve is a bit screwed. As the game starts quite hard, but gets significantly easier once you reach a certain loadout with your mercanaries. At that point even the cheap budget mercanaries become murder machines, which also takes some of the allure to hire the most expensive legendary mercs the game has to offer.

[strike]Another problem would be the stealth mechanics, the game stays in realtime before the battle begins. Which can be pretty frustrating when you try to set up an ambush. It would be nice to be able to pause the game or start the turn based mode by hand.[/strike]

What this is, is a modern X-COM with a coat of paint. Basically all of my complaints revolve around how unrealistic the combat is, and how restrictive the tactical and strategic options are. If you like X-Com, this is just a different take on that series currently.

Game balance is very poor, as the developers were too lazy to build large maps and a decent AI. So instead you are mobbed on tiny maps by braindead bullet sponge enemies.

Really, bullet sponges. Guys taking 4-5 hits at close range from automatic rifles and continuing to run full speed and hack my guys up with machetes. It's a joke. Not every hit needs to be completely devastating but the game makes getting into a firefight and getting shot seem like not that big of a deal which is jarring given the genre.

Ambushes dont work, since you cant pause the game and stack orders. Whichever merc of yours fires first will just have to sit tight during the ambush as every nearby enemy reacts instantly and isn't actually surprised at all. The game is also balanced towards setting all of your mercs to overwatch mode and letting them shoot down enemies who will run straight at you pretty much, which in my opinion is pretty boring and cheesy, but if you want to play optimally you have to do this otherwise you are wasting tons of AP.

Weapon damage balance is bizarre; the entire point of high volume of fire weapons like automatic rifles is that you get a high probability of a hit for the same time spent shooting at a target, but in this game you get a bunch of die rolls with dramatically reduced damage each. 

The lack of shops for ammo and weapons is game-breaking. That is compounded by the infuriating decision to have your enemies' loot vanish when they die. The whole goddamn point of a tactical game like this is that if you take a big risk you can get a big reward like some sweet gear that can allow you to bypass certain parts of the game. Replayability is really reduced on account of this. You are stuck trying to get good RNG off your encounters and have no reason to do risky things.

The maps are so small you can't do hit and run tactics at all. In fact AP pools for mercs being so small, combined with small maps and an AI that have huge AP pools, and seemingly no AP penalties from taking injuries, means that almost all firefights will be seen all the way through with virtually no maneuvering. This is terrible, again for replayability, and for serving multiple play styles.

As the game stands, the optimal strategy appears to be immediately junking every weapon you find that isn't a sniper rifle or rocket launcher, and making every sniper rifle silenced and just having one or two of your mercs with maxed marksmanship run around, snuffing out enemies completely silently. Other weapons simply dont do enough damage.

I really hate the magical crafting systems that games like these have. I'm all for survival mechanics but turning generic parts into advanced optics and suppressors and crap in the field is frankly ridiculous.

The inventory system is also pretty crappy, there is no sorting or filtering, and it's tedious as hell to do logistics for more than one squad. I'm guessing nobody playtested that.

tl;dr These guys had the blueprint for a perfect tactical combat game: JA2. All they needed to do was implement that combat system in a 3d version of the game. That's it. Fire your damn 'game designer' fools and just copy JA2. 

tl;dr 2.0: At least it has modding capabilities, so hopefully some wonderful members of the community will do a bunch of free work making the game actually good.",1692724209,1692724209,False,44,2,0.687954962253570557,4,True,False,False

- AI is really dumb, constantly friendly fires it’s teammates (it was a REAL pain to see this in A10, on both sides)
- balancing is REALLY bad, ARs and MPs have a huge automatic fire  malus.
- you can stand directly next to one Person and your hit Chance with an AK can be below 50%
- ARs are only useful up to 6 fields
- MPs up to four field
- and even then their hit chance and damage is pretty low 
- compared to a SR, which can single shot many enemies
- AI is also dumb in general, soldier’s running around like crazy chickens, using awful skills, they are usually only scary when standing directly next to you
- camera is annoyingly limited, especially at the corners and borders
- hit boxes of items are sometimes nearly impossible to hit
- strategic map usability is straight from hell, though one can get used to it
- inventory management is quite suboptimal
- you cannot pass items between teams
- Sometimes ammunition lands in the inventory of a soldier, instead of their common team inventory

Update 1:
I am optimistic that some of these issues will get fixed, and this game will be a no-brainer to buy (for turn-base strategy fans) in a few months. And despite the downsides, i see that the devs really put heart and effort into it.

AI is still stupid as hell, and sniper rifles are still ridiculously overpowered. Machine gun was nerfed in 1.0.3 because the stupid AI is running into the MG cone like a moth to flame.

The game contains a mix of numbers and words to convey information to the player. Significant, improved and reduced are all used alongside directly given numbers like damage, range and gun modification details.

[Edit: Active pause added in patch 1.1.0] Melee stealth is blah with random patrols and just trying to control a group ambush in real time is generally a more miss than hit tactic, with the added downside of not giving much detail about which environmental assets can be hidden in. This frustrates me more since there are a whole bunch of mechanics, items, perks and characters built around this system, yet its difficult and punishing to interact with.

Battle maps can be falsely advantageous with 100% clear shots suddenly being obstructed and buildings degrading at rapid rates from small arms fire. Your own shots at enemies can even destroy the floor from beneath you in one shot, with no indication that it will happen.

I have only a couple complaints. I think you should get more ammo from loot as you are always low on some ammo types. Kinda forces you to use guns with different ammo.

There were some bugs and one side quest I couldn't complete because of a bug.

There also needs to be more optimisation. I have a pretty powerful rig but it became a slide show a few times.

In my opinion, JA3 absolutely deliveres the Jagged Alliance experience.
As with the original games, the most fun is hiring different mercs - who all come with their own personality.
You will need a balanced team, since an excellent sharpshooter may not spot a trap or be able to heal someone. Or you might not be able to afford the skilled allrounder you are looking for right now.

Then, there is a large world to explore and the game gives you a lot of freedom on how to approach your campaign. The role-playing aspects are nicely done, with various endings to many of the quests.

The turn-based combat is solid, there are a lot of options on how to fight. E.g. flank with a sniper team, supress aproaching enemies with heavy weapons or sneaking around to get your toughest fighters into melee range. The AI could be a lot better though. Enemies do flank, but also just swarm into your killzone. This is especially annoying when you have AI fighting on both sides (militia vs. bad guys).

I read some criticism that JA3 is too close to the X-Com system. It looks like X-Com in terms of cover, but JA3 still gives you much more options as it still has an action-point based system.

What I dislike about the game is that you cannot force turned-based mode until combat starts. This is not a big deal in many fights, but sometimes it is. For example, when you enter a sector and there are enemies very near to your deployment area. You will be spotted asap and enemies might even fire at you before you have any chance to make decisions. In some sectors, this may give your squad a bad day.

And stand-off explosive weapons, especially the RPG-7, are modeled in a less-than optimal way. For one, at least half of the time the AI blows itself up with the thing. Then again, if you face multiple enemies with rocket launchers, you don't have much options. If you can't take them out with snipers in time, getting prone to lessen damage is the best option. I think they should have given the RPGs a turn penalty where they have one turn to set up and a second one to fire (and then move into cover or reload and set up a second shot).

What I like best about the game is, that even towards the end of the campaign, you still experience funny and unexpected comments by your mercs. The voice acting is good and I love some of the new characters, especially Kalyna.

Pros
+ Great merc ensemble with many old acquaintances from JA/JA2.
+ Voice-acting
+ Preserved the AP system, combined with skilltree.
+ Inside jokes and funny references
+ Devs fixed release bugs quickly and listen to community
+ Lots of details and little stories all over Gran Chien

Cons    
- No way to force turn-based mode before combat (at least without mods)
- Heavy weapons don't mix with stupid AI
- After a while, I'd love to see parts of Gran Chien that aren't as miserable
- Tedious ammo crafting


TL;DR: Worthy successor to JA2. While AI is not great, the overall genre-mix is done well. There aren't many games that give you such an entertaining ensemble of characters and a lot of freedom to employ them.",1692550808,1692550808,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

THQ Nordic is the gold standard in this genre at the moment.  If you only ever played JA2, these are the guys who have been making turn based strategy games since then and all the different mechanics are the evolution of that.  

This game is fantastic because all those Expedition games are kind of spiritual successors to Jagged Alliance and Fallout anyway.  

Only downside IMO is the lack of pause during real time which I suspect is there for balance reasons but the UI is too clunky and bad to justify that.  For example there is no way to order your soldiers to form a line.  They teach you that before they even give you a gun irl.  Fortunately there is a mod that takes care of it but it's a really bad design decision.  You may have like ten seconds of prep time before combat starts where you're all standing in a group.  There's a ""take cover button"" but you still have to hit tilde and H to hide every time.  It's a turn based game, not a twich shooter.  We're all 40 here.  Serious only big downside to the game.

Other complaints I have are small nitpicks also solved by this one mod, i.e. auto sorting the stash and auto stacking items.  Again I do not understand this design decision that is so obviously easily fixed.  If you are looking for the mod, just sort by popular as I guarantee it will still be the top mod for many years unless the devs decide to incorporate it.  Which they might, they're pretty good devs.

All in all, E: Vikings was one of my favorite games ever (replayed it three times).  E: Rome I thought became too large, clunky, near the end.  The item system in that game was impossible to parse and you had to basically check every weapon against every other weapon all the time.  We'll see how the end game of this one does but I think they fixed a lot of the problems with the item system by simplifying it.  I certainly don't hate fiddling with my squad as much as I grew to hate it in Rome.  

There is a timed quest in the game but at least it's not the main quest.  Not enough heads up on that one though, that's for sure.  

All in all, a fantastic game, another chapter in what's getting to be a long string of good turn based strategy games from THQ Nordic.  If you like turn based strategy games, these are the people.  And if you like the genre, I would strongly recommend the game at full price.  It would be hard to enjoy this game if you do not.

I was replaying the JA2 out of nostalgia when JA3 went out, and I dropped everything to play JA3 instead. Because, to put it simply, most of things in JA3 seem better.
PROS:
Obviously, great graphical and engine quality, compared to JA2. Good description of war-torn/dilapidated settlements. It’s not just for show, about everything could be used as cover, but is also destructible. Weather effects and day/night change visibility and even the damage you do. Weapons may allow specific actions (like run and shoot, with pistols and SMGs), and as they level-up, you give your mercs additional traits, making them more custom, more special, and more deadly. Very tactical.
Great continuity. The characters from JA1/JA2 had some stated quirks and specific background, but for the most part it stayed in the background. These have been weaponized and are now a specific trait of a mercenary, making each of them unique in some way. Fidel, an explosive specialist, can throw two grenades in one action, others mercenaries are producing resources on their own, other mercenaries improve morale or ignore some specific penalties… These starting traits do not have the same level of usefulness, it depends on your playstyle.
The likes and dislikes of mercs are still around. They will have higher morale with their friends in the team, and less with people they hate. You really must consider that. Makes them more personable, too. They are not interchangeable canon fodder (actually, yes they are, but you may feel bad about some of them dying…)
Story and sidequests OK. Plenty enough to rank as a RPG. Typical of the stereotypes of a developing country, so a bit cliché, but the Jagged Alliance has always been about the clichés and “romantism” around mercenaries used in conflicts in Africa and South America.
For French players, bilingual/historical bonus, you get to help a former French (or Belgian?) colony gathering a bit more freedom by getting them out of the clutches of mining corporations, rogue military, and/or the local commie rebels. 
Interface mostly OK. Controls intuitive and easy to learn. Some things were easier to check or do in JA2. Good variety of guns, ammo and other equipment, I already saw some old favorites. Like JA2, you start in open spaces with mostly close-range weapons, but compared to JA2, thankfully you very quickly get your first assault rifles and long-range rifles, and that changes a lot how you fight. But see below for some “nope”.
MAYBE YES, MAYBE NO
This is not just a fighting game/tactical game. There is an important management side. You have to consider accurately your resources, who you hire, for how long, with who. Even on the lowest level, it’s easy to not make enough money. You have to go secure mines as soon as you can. Don’t forget training militia. Having meatshields distracting foes while you skulk around is a lifesaver.
Difficulty variable. One sector has 6 unaware foes, it’s just a breeze, a scripted battle has 5 or more waves of 10+ foes (I lost count), plus a mortar bombing you from off-screen, it’s a nasty surprise of a difficulty spike. Good thing I had enough ammo on stock. Don’t let three thugs ganging on you with their knifes, they are bullet sponges, and they WILL cut your mercs into bloody chunks in one turn. Or instead of knifes, they have a shotgun, and they get a free retaliation shot whenever you failed to kill them in one attack. It’s deadly.
Weapons, and to a lesser extent, armor can be improved by using (limited) resources. Good, and another level in management. You get these resources mostly by tearing apart other weapons and armor (and the occasional, rare loot drop). There is a small risk of messing up the improvement (and you will then need to repair your item). So far, OK. Less good, you get not refund when you tear THAT improved weapon apart, just the same amount of scraps as an unmodified weapon. Oddly enough, unlike the previous JA games, you cannot simply unscrew the scope, laser sight, etc. of a weapon and put it on a new one. You don’t even get the scope’s lens back. I guess you tear apart the weapons with a sledgehammer.
Every car is a Punto.  A stray bullet hit a side window of a van, two turns latter it explodes. The same bullet which would have lightly incommoded the bad guy you were targeting.
BAD:
A few bugs with scripted events. Fight alongside a freelance merc, he dies, things get weird. Civilians walk in fire (and caught fire), and start looting the corpse next to you, while the firefight in on-going. Loss of control was to the point I had to reload a save from before arriving in the sector.
Reload, and a friendly NPC has forgotten he was busy firing at the bad guys. And the smoke grenade you launched last round will have forgotten it was busy producing smoke.
Being save scumming a lot, and that’s on easy difficulty. 
No more ""hollow point bullet is stopped by armor and does damage to endurance/energy instead of HP"". A bit disappointing.
Pistols and SMGs are wimp. Even most shotguns and assault rifles won’t reliably do a one-hit-kill headshot. Grenades are OK, if a bit weak, but situational, and better used by specialists. If you want to end a foe quickly, and as you are very often outnumbered, you will want to, you only have one option: headshot with a high-damage weapon, meaning rifles. 
Ideally, starting from stealth, for improved accuracy and damage. Knifes sometimes work on unaware foes, too, either thrown or in close contact, but again, some save scumming may be involved. Up close, with some cover for you, and setting some overwatch, small arm fire is getting better, but rifle fire still outclasses them. And when you are in the open and the RNG is not with you… And your foes WILL do a lot of damage with their assault rifles and machine guns. 
Ammo. Plentiful for small arms, rarer for shotgun and rifles. Good thing I am going for one bullet – one kill, because I am about to run dry on 7.62 NATO, at not even 1/3 of the game. For some time, I had some weak 5.56 assault rifles but no ammo for them. Barely more ammo, now. If I had been using a lot more of semi-auto attacks, or that nice machine gun (8 bullet per shot), I would be dry. I may be forced to use as main weapons the SMGs I kept as back-up. If there are ammo merchants, I have missed them. I cannot say I am happy about all that.",1692292455,1692534109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do not let these geriatric nerds try and compare the base game to this. JA3 is great, well designed, and not too overwhelming for new players familiar with simpler games like the XCOM reboot.

For me personally it got a bit too easy as soon as I set up the right squad(s) and had sufficient mine control (on Commando difficulty). For this reason the game throws a few very well placed curve balls on your way from time to time. For me these always came at exactly the right time, when I was just thinking the game got too easy. I would still recommend to play on a higher difficulty (commando or mission impossible), if you know the mechanics. Especially if you want to have a more challenging end game. You can also always change the difficulty during the game.

I might start another run on ""mission impossible"" and maybe enable ""dead is dead"" (no save scumming) for my second play through. I have to admit that I reloaded a few times, when something totally unexpected hit me or I misunderstood some of the mechanics. Without that, the game would have been way more difficult for me.

The developers clearly thought a lot about the player experience and seem to have good mod support. Some mods I would recommend, which dont change the game significantly are Active Pause (Pause Game outside of Combat), Trap is Mechanical or Explosive (tells you if you need mech or exp skills to remove a trap), Hotfix Click to Move Bug (fixes a small bug, which lead to being able to use all AP for moving) and Show Tired / Rested Status (tells you, if you can savely travel to the next zone without arriving with tired Mercs).

Visually it looks good but also has some issues in terms of performance. You may have to scale down some settings even on good PC builds.

The voice acting and sound quality overall are great. Some characters will get on your nerves though after a while due to their personality an repetitive voice lines during combat.

In terms of tactical combat I think XCOM is a better game. Still JA3 is a solid entry with some issues. It's sometimes easy to miss-click and the information regarding shots and hit chances is to vague. There are mods to improve the information value though.

The inventory management is somewhat annoying and I think things like getting ammo for specific types of weapons should be easier and not so reliable on getting the right drops. If I encounter enemy soldiers with AK-47s then I'd assume they also carry at least one or two spare magazines but often at best they just drop a weapon with ammo inside. This should be improved. Also some items in terms of handling are just way to annoying. The whole aspect of explosives that do not immediately blow up (C4 with timer for example) makes them completely useless. I've only used throwable grenades, grenade and rocket launchers. Dynamite and C4 was unusable with the simple combination tools as enemies never got close enough to be caught in the explosions. The only way to use dynamite or C4 effectively would be to build more grenades but usually you find enough of them already and therefore it becomes somewhat useless again and you cannot really use to create alternative ways on solving problems (blow up locks instead of picking them for example). More options here would've been great.

Anyway JA3 is good for a playthrough which can take up to a 100 hours if you try to finish all side missions and re-load a few times due to tactical losses.

Something else worthy mentioning:
JA3 is a full game with no additional cost. There is no ingame shop with additional skins or other kind of typical current year nonsense. You pay the price and you get the whole game.",1690742415,1692393271,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Take it for instance. Environmental interaction is little to none, heavy gunners and snipers have in fact only one viable stance that is to prone, even if there is a perfect natural firing position right in front of you, whether it is watch tower railings, a waist high chunk of granite, you just have to prone because there is only one option available especially for machine gunners, machine guns and sniper rifles simply can not be set up above covering objects such as rocks, window frames, back of cars or even sand bags, which will result in a funny and awkward situation, if your machine gunner is behind a good cover, you have to move him from there to open field otherwise he will just prone and the covering object will completely block his line of sight.

Cars no matter how wrecked it may seem or rusted by the look, they will start burning by a single shot and surely explode nonetheless, and one exploding car near another will trigger an chain reaction of car explosions, it almost felt like these are car bombs in the first place. Dont use cars/trucks as cover.

Stealth kill is a myth to some extent, you can walk in broad daylight pass enemy patrol right under his nose like 15 yards away and he wont notice you, but when you put down the same patrol at midnight his fella soldier 50 yards away looking the other side has a fair to good chance somehow being alarmed.

This is a true sucessor of Jagged Alliance 2, brought to this year and season. 

After so many years, we got this.

Sure its not JA2 V1.13 with 200 guns and 100 acessories that would put down most audience except the hard fan base, but is a very enjoyable vanilla experience, that i hope, in the future, mods will make it better.

Heavy Pros
-Most mercenaries are back, with a few good new ones. Voices, although not equal, are very well done
-Humour is fantastic, and in a world that today is rulled by offended people, i really like the courage that they had to keep all the stereotypes humour, where in the 90s/00s, we really did have fun without so many restrains.
-Lots of easter eggs and pop culture refences
-Dialogues, Quests, and Lenght are just enough.
-The tactic part is stellar with some excellent combats and ideas


Minus
-Some performance issues in a top quality PC
-Did really miss all the mercs from MERC and some like Maddog from Arulco
-Money managment is not well balanced, but not a dealbreaker.
-Minor bugs
-Not in size, not in breakthrough, not in the dialogues, it doesent reach JA2, but that, surely was not expected in the first place. JA2 its a true masterpiece.

You wobble around with group, or groups, of mercenaries and try to save the Grand Chien nation of whatever. 
There are plenty of things to do, side missions and enemies to fight. Your mercenaries have variety in them and there are different 'classes' and each merk has their own unique-ish perks and stats you need to work with. They can also be improved over time

Sometimes enemies do silly things like try shooting mortars inside houses or shoot through their own allies to shoot you but mostly they do things that make sense.
There are quite a few of different type of enemies and you can shoot them with large selection of weapons ranging from pistols to RPGs. 
Mix in that with different ammo types like armor piercing, sub sonic and so on and sometimes you feel like you're playing inventory sorting simulator when you are trying to figure out who needs and what in your squads.

It can get tedious occasionally and you feel like doing the same thing over and over again if you try to clear every map screen and stop every diamond shipment to get that cash money to keep your mercenaries hired but all in all I've enjoyed it.

It is a fun take on turn based tactics, played through a couple times and it has enough variability in scenarios that allow you to try different options of teams/weapons.
The Merc like/dislike system could have been better along with the morale system, but there is enough there to help guide some of the decisions you make.
The side quests can feel daunting with the amount there are and how many can be active at once.

After 163 hours my first playthrough is finished and wow, it was a long time since I had so much fun and got so involved in a game. I'm a grown man with responsibilities and I've played this game for an average of 5 hours per day since it released. That is crazy! (and a bit shameful)

Is it a perfect game? No. Games like this never are. There are always features and and designs you would have hoped for. But it is a really polished and entertaining game! 

I have loved Jagged Alliance since the 1st version almost 30 years ago. I can still remember sitting in his basement and just marvelling over what a cool game it was. Jagged Alliance 2 was of course amazing and set the bar for all other turn based squad games. I even played BIA a couple of times. And I have suffered through some of the horrible attempts at a Jagged Alliance 3. Oh my, the sadness that is Flashback... 
But this version is it! It is such a worthy successor and even outshines Jagged Alliance 2. (There will always be sentimental people dissing new games despite how good they are, keep that in mind for the few negative reviews)

I won't spoil it story wise, but some turns and twists for me were just amazing. It was almost like the game had scripted for me to be in certain sectors when things happened, which I know isn't the case. I took out one major enemy spontaneously out of pure chance and I couldn't believe it when I did. I actually cheered out loud! 

After 163 hours I have had a long and fulfilling story where I felt I have completed most (but not all) major quest lines and there were quite a lof of smaller quests left to do. Paired with the varying ways on how to solve quests (which will impact the end) there is a big replayability value to this game!

My advice for your first run:
1) Do some non-spoiler research for how to play the game. Setting up overwatch (even outside of combat) and learning how to use stealth, mods, cover and different types of ammo is essential to enjoying the game. There is not much tutorial help from the game regarding this.
2) Play the game without mods your first time. It's a balanced game, so enjoy it how it is. Some bosses are bullet sponges, but only early in the game, before you have good enough guns and ammunition. When things feel unbalanced it is because you haven't fully grasped the tactics yet.
3) Treat the game mainly as a fun RPG. Save scum whenever things go horribly, but allow yourself some losses as well. For me hiring Raider and Raven and then having a grieving Raider refuse to renew his contract when she died was just part of the amazing story. Follow your instincts and have your squads react in a realistic manner to the situations they are put in and you will be rewarded with a rich and very entertaining story.

I will pause this obsession a bit. but I'm very much looking forward to a second run spiced up with some mods.

I feel reallly greatful to Haemimont Games and THQ Nordic! I'd given up hope on ever playing a great Jagged Alliance game again. I really hope they will keep making new entries in this genre.",1692202713,1692202713,True,27,0,0.771343648433685303,0,True,False,False

For now buggy and poorly optimized (at least for AMD). Some mods are almost mandatory, otherwise too much hassle with inventory. Also some mods fix bugs.
Story is good, side quests are nice too. Decisions don't affect the world much except for ending scenes and the possibility to get some scripted mercs for free.
Combat is alright but soon after a /major changing event/ becomes boring. Thx for autocombat, I wouldn't have finished the game without it. Barely any reason to use auto modes on guns because for some reason in auto bullets hurt less, so that means snipers and weapons with high range are just better. Different bullet types could have been a nice addition but switching is wonky and maybe only makes sense on highest difficulty. Opponent AI can be played easily... nothing new here actually. I actually liked not seeing hit chances, makes it more natural somehow.
Mercs are cool, have personalities. The constant repeating of phases gets though... man, does it get old fast, made me turn the sound off.

What can be improved :
-both sides have too much information, more fog of war for the element of surprised and more engaging.
-the night should be darker, esp when selecting merc without NVG, this should impacting visibility too not just accuracy.
-the AI should progressed to, using more cover instead of always being suicidal (camping is not fun, so does suicidal)
-weather should not affect bullet damage or grazing hit.
-speaking of damage, kinda hate when seeing multiple goon carrying rpg's, and firing every single turn all the time, how convenience, should be limited to 1 or 2 ppl, and give reload time of 1 full turn
-increase AP of MGL, should be 1 use per turn.
-separate slider setting between mine income and enemy AI, I still hard managing 2 full squad with forgiving mode activated ( 1 legendary, 1 veteran, the rest are recruit and free character)
-sector stash should be sorted, seriously, it became inventory simulator later on or auto scrap.
-wounds and repairing items become tedious and chore later on, wounds should have more lasting effect, like 3 more battle to be fully healed, repairing item too, with the abundance of weapon loot, kinda sad to use only 1 fav weapon and thats it, final. This can be improved too, not optimal condition can resulted lower accuracy, lower damage, etc.

overall nice game, cant wait to go home from office just to continue playing.

I think it's finally time for me to write about my experience with the game. So here's some unnecessarily nostalgic rambling, and disjointed thought stream about the game.

First off, I've played all the Jagged Alliance games (up until JA 2) since they were first released. So I have a high tolerance for outdated game mechanics, and inappropriate humor. Just wanted to clear that up, so you know where I'm coming from. Another thing you should know, is that I have been playing the game with a few selected mods, more or less right from the beginning. This might skew my perspective a bit, and I can't rightfully say that I've had a fully vanilla experience.

The first Jagged Alliance was my introduction to a proper, turn based tactical game. After that, I knew that was the one genre I liked the best. Deadly Games had a more episodic approach, and more diverse locations. For some reason, DG has remained as the most impactful JA game in my mind. When JA 2 came out, I was overwhelmed! JA 2 was a huge step up from the earlier games, on all fronts. It was vast, and complex, and I just couldn't handle it for a while. After I got over the initial shock, the game became one of my all time favorites, for years to come. Certainly a king of the hill, as far as tactical turn based games were concerned. A genre that died out all together, as years went by.

I played JA 2 from time to time over the years, and it was good but like many others, I yearned for a successor for this great game. There were some attempts at JA games, but none of them succeeded in capturing even a bit of the original spirit. I backed JA Flashback in Kickstarter, in hopes of it being the one. Boy was I wrong! Talk about an abomination of a game, and a scam that is best forgotten altogether.

I'm glad to be able to say, that we finally have a worthy successor for JA 2. Jagged Alliance 3 is pretty much everything I could hope from the game series, given how outdated the whole genre is at it's roots.

Like I hinted in the beginning, the game is outdated in many ways, and I feel like it's a love letter for us oldies in some way. It's hard for me to see this game starting any new trends, or rising to a status of a modern classic. What I do see in JA 3's future is it developing in a lovely cult classic, that will hopefully be developed further with mods. 

One of the main strengths of JA 3 is that fact, that it's clearly targeted for the fans of the original series. The developers didn't try to make the game into something it isn't. Almost everything about the game reminds me about a time gone by. I'm fine with the game being so clearly focused, towards an audience hungry for a nostalgic fix. That's not to say, that JA 3 is just a dusty a relic that lives in it's own ecosystem, but I have a feeling that it won't be a huge hit among the younger crowd. I would be happy to be proven wrong though!

The game is hugely unapologetic, and some details about it tells me that the developers thought ""Let's go all out, we don't have anything to lose."". Details like Steroids quips about a certain nationality come to mind! Things like this are hilarious to me but then again, I'm a child of the 80/90s, and as such can't and won't subscribe to many of the social norms, that are prevalent today. I'll admit that not all of it is that funny (not offensive to me, but just unfunny), but it's all keeping in tone of the series. If JA 3 is the last hurrah for offensive humor, then I'm fine with the rest of the world moving on after this.

Some reviews have critiqued the writing, but I can't fault it. The story is a very basic, good vs. evil stuff with some pretty obvious twists and turns, and some betrayal sprinkled on top. A classic action movie stuff, that fits in perfectly with the tone of the game. In the age of hugely complex, and long reaching sagas in games, tv-series' etc, again JA 3's writing is a blast from the past. There's a lot of small side quests that are mostly entertaining, and bring some variety to the main game loop.

Talking about variety, one big thing is how diverse the sectors are from each other. There's a lot of them, but none of them feels like one of the others you've visited before. Not all of them are that big, or have a lot of stuff to find/to do in them. It's just that the sectors are very well designed, and this is even more apparent during the multiple times, you are engaged in combat in them. The maps feel very believable, and you have a lot of tactical possibilities when it comes to utilizing the terrain to your advantage. There's height difference that matters, doors and windows you can go through, exploding barrels, rocks bushes (none of those bullet proof ones from the earlier games!), trees etc. The combat is JA 3 is like a tactical dream come true for me.

It's not perfect, and I would like to have a bit more control over the combat altogether. For example, overwatch being as prevalent as it is, I haven't found a way to command a merc to use anything other than semi auto fire during his/her turn. All in all, the combat is very solid in the end. The sectors are so varied, that the combat didn't get stale for me at any point. There were a lot of moments during the fights, where I had to stop and marvel at what just happened. Be it a clever move by an enemy, or my team executing perfect overwatches, almost killing all the enemies in one turn.

In the beginning, I mentioned I was using some mods. There were a few QOL mods, for cutting down on some of the more clunky/nonsensical aspects of the game. Probably the most game changing mod I used, was the ""Descriptive chance to hit"" mod. Now I know, that before I started my playthrough, I thought that the vague stock hit chance indicator wouldn't bother me. The fact is, that the previous JA games had an even more vague indicator. I found that even the worded description of a chance to hit, made the game a lot more enjoyable. I'll admit that I'm a save scummer through and through. I don't like to have too much chaos, and unpredictability in my games. If a merc dies, I will reload a save and try again. I think the descriptive chance to hit indicator just suits my methodical, and perfectionist playstyle. Who knows, I might try again without it.

Another significant mod I used, was the real time pause, which should come as stock in my opinion.

On the boring, technical side I'll just say that the game looks really good, and sounds great too. The animations are especially good, and there's a lot of detail in the world. One small gripe that I have with the visuals, is the fact that clicking on objects (hacking, salvaging, speaking to NPCs etc.) in the world can be a pixel hunt, and often times the camera angles don't help either. Nothing too frustrating though.

To recap, I love this game! I have to hand it to Haemimont Games, for pulling of a game like Jagged Alliance 3. They really captured the spirit of the game series. Makes me feel like a kid again, playing with my toy soldiers in a sand box. So thank you Haemimont Games, I wish you continue to support this franchise for a long time.

The setting and characters are like Far Cry 2, if it had comedy. I'm loving that you have to manage your budget by controlling diamond mines or capturing diamonds just to keep your mercenaries on the pay roll. In combat the game doesn't give you the percentage of you making a shot. Instead the mercenaries will comment on whether or not they think the shot is possible. After a while you know what range your mercenaries and their weapon needs to be at to make a shot. As well as how far to zoom in using AP, possibly freeing up AP for multiple shots in a turn.

I've seen negative comments about stealth attacks in this game. I really haven't used melee weapons for stealth kills often as it doesn't usually work for me. Definitely user error to blame.  Normally I just set up ambushes with overlapping fields of fire via the ""overwatch"" ability. I've also seen negative comments about SMGs and ARs not being as good as bolt action rifles. The bolt actions and semi automatic sniper rifles with their scopes definitely hit targets more consistently and for more damage. While also allowing your mercenary to be in cover and farther away from the enemy, reducing their chance of taking damage. Especially when you know your mercenaries and their high level of marksmanship can land a head shot on an enemy. Allowing you to kill an enemy in 1 or 2 turns.

Having played some of the spin-offs and remakes that were released in the past 20 years, I felt skeptical when I first heard about a new Jagged Alliance game. With the main campaign finished, along with most of the side quests, I feel that Jagged Alliance 3 might just have put the series back on the rails and created a solid foundation for possible future titles.

While the game doesn't feel as in-depth and fleshed out as Jagged Alliance 1 & 2, the game surely captures the spirit and feeling of the what the series is all about: a tactical strategy game with RPG elements, interesting characters and vast world to explore.

Likes & Dislikes

++ The Mercs / Characters ++
The mercenary roster offers a good amount of variety, leaving you to mix and match characters for your team and the task at hand. There are familiar faces from previous games, but also new and interesting ones to recruit and meet. The interactions between the mercenaries, the banter and bickering give them enough character to make each of them feel unique and that you're working with a team, rather than expendable pawns. The characters are well voiced and feature cool and unique designs.

++ The map / levels ++
Featuring more than 160 handcrafted areas, there's a lot of different places to explore and to fight your opponents in. With the changing weather conditions, day- and nighttime cycle and destructible structures, even familiar maps can provide new challenges. 

+ Weapons +
The game features a decent amount of various weapons, one better and more customizable than the other and there's good progression in the weapons you encounter throughout the length of the game. I'd have loved to be able to purchase weapons and ammunition. While JA3 offers a shopping stall here and there, you can only buy a weapon or box of ammo from there once.

+ Combat +
The combat in Jagged Alliance 3 is good, but could use some work. It takes a lot of inspiration from its predecessors and adds new strategic elements, such as interrupt attacks you can set up yourself, gun nests, stealth and unique abilities for your mercs. 
Some enemies do feel a bit bullet spongy, especially if they take 3 to 5 attacks to kill while you're already outnumbered sometimes, especially in the beginning of the game. Later in the game, some events tend to be a bit too overwhelming if you don't have enough mercenaries in the sector, forcing you to give it a couple of tries or look for a cheesy way out. There's definitely a few balancing issues that could use some polishing. 

Overall, I really enjoyed playing this game. It brought back some nostalgic feelings and for 45 euros I had 97 hours of fun. I will definitely do a couple more runs and try out the co-op mode in the future. The game itself could use a few tweaks here and there and I'm hoping that, with Steam Workshop, Jagged Alliance 3 will get a passionate modding community like there was for Jagged Alliance 2. 

Hats off to Haemimont Games for delivering a worthy successor to the Jagged Alliance franchise.

I simply don't understand: devs certainly aware of the JA2 1.13 and that was an awesome work of community supporting the predecessor game for many years. Just take it and make the diamond of it with your resourses.
But no, what they do: just new graphic, another storyline and simple casual gameplay for mobile phones.
Its just another game made for people, who spent their half an hour of free time after work before the dinner.
Really it is supposed to be a PWC or mercenary simulation, it means there should be attention to details. Mostly in weaponry, amunition and tactics. There should be micromanagement.

But what I see here:
- so few weapon choice, almost nothing in game
- calibers not matching weaponry (7.62 for MG42 i.e.)
- very strange approach for weapons attachments (Acog made from lens and scrap, what?)
- most important: damage difference for weapons but not for ammo. That is so casual, like a joke. Guns cant have its own damage characteristics, only ammunition has. It doesn't matter you fire bullet of 9x19 from Glock or MP5, the cartridge with bullet has its own ballistic performance, not a gun.
- bunch of clowns as enemies.
- why we cant see the armor either on enemies nor at own mercenaries? PWC warriors in gavayan shirts, shorts and colored dreads instead of combat helmet and webbing?
- so tiny maps.
- hardness of game depending on simple the health bar of enemies. A burst to the head of 7.62x51 and enemy still happy running? What a crap.
- no tactical vests, no backpacks, no utilities like nightgoogles etc, nothing here.

Just look at game 7.62 High Caliber, or JA2 1.13. That was a proper sufficient simulation but this game is another disappointing experience.
It is still playable of course, but just an average gizmo like other previous JA3 attempts.",1690035750,1692013334,False,3,1,0.478350520133972168,2,True,False,False

This is however a very solid and enjoyable experience, in a pretty interesting world full of chuckle worthy cliches (thankfully ignoring the overly sensitive crybabies who bemoan anything seemingly insensitive). 

Your actions, direct and indirectly, really feel like you're influencing the region as you play. When it comes to battles where damage persists, that garage you leveled with a liberal application of explosives will remain rubble even when you find yourself needing the cover it once provided. 

But a few points to consider for new and old players: 

- You can't buy ammo aside from some street vendors who sell only a single type. You CAN craft your own ammo with found gunpowder and spare parts (though drop rates on gunpowder could be higher), and using single shot fire modes when possible will leave you with a plethora of ammo to spare when it's desperately needed. Keep a spare gun or two of a type not often used as a backup, like a couple MP5s in my case. Also, when higher leveled enemies come into play, convert your basic ammo over to armor piercing rounds, you'll thank me. 
- If you want to rely heavily on explosives, get Barry. He creates his own thrown shaped charges (totally free, no supplies needed) that can decimate groups of all but the most high HP opponents. Explosives bypass most armor from what I can see in JA3.
- Get the first mine quickly so you don't run out of funds (creating your own merc with AIM is also advised, they're free to keep using past the initial $6,999 purchase). Also, start with cheap mercs and build up their skills/levels. Early game, Legendary mercs will eat your funds, but later on even when your mines are depleted, you still get a small enough income from each to run ~4 full squads with no issues (2-3 if you have a ton of legendary and high priced mercenaries). I know some people are complaining, but I've got 3 full squads and millions in savings that keep going up. Just use towns as chokepoints for enemy strike teams and diamond shipments, they'll love you in no time for protecting them, and your income from even depleted mines go way up.",1691983564,1691983564,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- No weapon dealers, at least in the first hours of the game. No professional mercenary would go into a war zone equipped with a pistol and without any kind of armor against enemies with AK-47. You should be able to order and buy equipment. 
- Missing shots at point blank distance with a pistol shouldn't happen
- Stealth is overpowered, I can simply almost stroll under the enemy's nose
- I simply walked through mines, 2 exploded and I was at 50% health... what's that about? An AP mine completely kills someone.

I do not simply love the JA series - it runs in my veins since I (twelve-year-old boy from Eastern Europe) came back from a smelly local computer shop with a dusty cardboard box with my discounted copy of the JA2 back in 2003. Developers of the original JA1+2 are something like my second parents - their game taught me English, nurtured me when I was in a bad spot, shaped my sense of humor... Heck, I still quote merc's lines in front of my uncomprehending and often confused wife. For twenty years I've been playing JA and all its underwhelming spin-offs. But hear me: 
[b] JA3 is so good game it threw me back to my childhood and made me feel the love and passion for the series again. [/b]

The JA3 is in a way very similar to XCOM sequel from 2012. As a big fan of the original XCOM game from 1994, I really enjoyed the modern reimplementation. Not only the game was ""modernized"" in terms of quality of life and graphics - its gameplay was somewhat simplified, and polished, but still very clever and elegant. It caught the essence of the original game and remade it into something familiar, yet new. The same thing applies to JA3.

[b] Long story short: [/b] The [i]core elements[/i] are still here (silly humor, sympathetic characters and their wisecrackers, satisfying gunplay, story revolving around action genre clichés), the [i]annoying elements[/i] were removed (tedious inventory management, slow battling, horrible and overcomplicated controls of 90's era). Overal ""simplification"" made the game more ""swift"" and lightweight, yet still deeply strategic in the very core. 

Oh, yes, there are also flaws. Repetitive fights, flat difficulty ""curve"", quirky UI, loose story threads... But hey: All of them are ""fixable"" (by devs or mods) and not hardcoded into the game DNA. JA3 sadly lacks many elements of the beloved JA2 (silly websites, gun shop), but the main issue with the game is, at least for me, losing the steam after +- 20 hours (which is, to be fair, just enough time to finish the game, if you are not a completionist like me).

There is little to no reason to play the game again after THE END (which I found [spoiler]underwhelming and bland when compared not only to taking down Deidrana but almost all game endings I saw in recent years [/spoiler]). Yet, addictive gameplay spiced up with a bit of modding and/or DLCs could turn this gem into a modern classic my kids will remember the same way as I did with JA2.

It is far ahead everything that came out since JA2.
And it is, fairly speaking, a descent game.

Why ""negative""?
Because devs broke some essential things that worked well, and it brought me to a painful love-hate relationships with the game, because they make me struggle for no good reason.
And I'm not speaking about bugs, which are plenty. And not about some new mechanics that feel broken or not well-thought.
I'm speaking about core mechanics, that are virtually the same as in JA2, but implemented a hell lot worse.
Here are some examples.

1. You cannot position your mercs inside your own sector before battle.
Why? You know enemy is coming. The sector is yours.
Why are you limited to a number of positions, sometimes very inconvenient?
Not a problem, you might say, just drop mercs somewhere and move them to desired locations before the enemy notices you?
And that's problem number two!

2. No forced turn-based mode!
You have to stay in realtime until the battle begins.
That means:
- you will struggle to get at least some mercs to the positions you want.
- you won't be able to start battle fully on your terms, even when you're well positioned and hidden.
- you have little to no chance to execute a proper pincer move.

3. Stupid smart stealth kill system.
You want to stay quiet and elimitate enemies one by one with your trusty knife?
Prepare for a sh*tload of savescum.
Why?
Because your merc will deside on its own if he/she wants to hit enemy or not.
It supposed to work when you get close enough, BUT! Wrong angle, wrong terrain, wrong moon phase — and your merc will just hug your enemy and willfully take foe's gun barrel in his/her mouth.

I'm sure that is not all. That's just from the top of my mind.
And every issue I mentioned worked like a charm in JA2.
And it would not hurt JA3 in any way to keep those things as they are.

To summarise: while I can recommend to at least give it a try with the game, here is my shoutout to the devs.

While there may be some questions about design choices (a lot of people, apparently, are stuck up on the chance to hit not being shown as a percentage, which wasn't a bother to me; or the lack of an in-game reliable shop, i.e. something like Bobby Ray's from JA2 - which does bother me a bit), the sometimes cryptic menus that may take a while to figure out (how does stealth kill work and interact with other systems? what does this aiming thing interface mean?) and balance (by default the low drop rates of ammo, weapons, and anything really, edging you towards a gameplay style that's reliant on sniper rifles to minimise ammo use and waste), most of these are solved with mods, and you can tailor your experience to your needs and expectations easily.

The roster of mercs is not as expansive as in JA2, but there's still plenty of characters to go around (plus the free recruitables), there's still the banter you'd expect - like I said, a faithful recreation of the atmosphere of its original predecessors.

In a total vacuum without any previous baggage I can say this game is incredibly fun for fans of squad-based tactics like XCOM, older Fallout games, and so forth. ( Mainly and so forth :D )

Here's a short list of reasons I like this game, and maybe you'll understand where I'm coming from:

- The variety of weaponry, and the variety of _application_ of that weaponry. We've all played games where the difference between a pistol and an LMG is like, range and damage. In JA3 they couldn't be more different, with having a free hand for grenades, having two pistols, shooting for fewer AP, less range, and less ammo consumption being weighed against insane stopping power, an overwatch cone with area denial, the ability to destroy environments, but at a much higher ammo cost. Sometimes you choose to use a weapon because you have lots of spare ammo for it, and I think that's a very fun layer of strategy I don't see a lot.
- It's very pretty. Jungles, beaches, savanna, dusty deserts and it's all very pretty.
- Splitting squads to run different units to different places to fetch gear you've stashed, go to hospitals for treatment, train local militia, and search quiet maps for loose gear is strangely compelling. Since you pay (most) of your troops by the day, you want to get the most out of them on the daily and that means lots of split squad mobilizations.
- Speaking of splitting squads, once you're into the middlegame you'll have the finances to shoulder multiple squads of mercs. You can actually attack the same entrenched enemy position from multiple sides simultaneously. While controlling units in real time (Before you're discovered and the game drops into a turn based mode) you can prepare timed, remote, or proximity explosives, move your snipers into cover, sneak your melee expert in close, and prepare your LMG guy to guard a key killzone. The leg work and prep options are limitless.

Okay that's enough. And I could really go on. It's a very, very fun game. It also doesn't baby you and you may fail a few times learning the ropes.... don't be afraid of that. It'll take a few attempts to do it all anyway.

So why the negative review?
Cons: BAD performance, unstable fps, clunky UI, hard to use stealth system, YOU CAN'T see your chance to hit wich is a huge problem on higher difficulty since i couldnt hit a single enemy for many rounds and i almost lost the fight.
Terrible balanced stealth, you need to use stealth but it's either too hard to use or too good to use dending on choice of mercs wich forces choices on player. It's the worst stealth system i have ever seen in an isometric game
Other problems: oveheating of the cpu, random game freeze, game was advertised as open world but it's linear, maps being split in small maps, once you get past the first 3-4 hours the game is pretty much the same
Later Edit: The game gets much better after 10 hours but it definetly needs you to read guides and experiment. At least it's not as impossibly hard as colony ship

To me it is baffling how these modern JA titles cannot hold a candle to a 24 year old game.

a few examples:

- they changed some of the JA2 mercs rather drastically (totally different voice and personality) in a way that many of them make a more superficial/cartoony impression

- learn to like / dislike not working (you need a mod to fix it)

- martial arts trait uses same animations as normal Hand to Hand combat (just one basic punch)

- compared to JA2 there are so many weapons missing...

- IMP merc (your own avatar) is lifeless, compare these to JA2 where they had 6 FULLY voiced options with banter etc., you basically just hire him because no other  cheap merc has decent leadership (which you need to travel efficiently)

I could go on...

for me as an old JA2 vet it scratches the itch but at the same time you know it's not the real deal.

You could compare this game to the new XCOM series from Firaxis Games. XCOM 1 and 2 are amazing achievements in the RTS genre from a story and pacing standpoint. But humbly speaking, there are a lot of places in the game mechanics where it's too simplified for my tastes. The ballistics are pretty random. Yeah, cover and flanking positions have an impact, but it's a pretty basic system, and the weapon dynamics don't really change other than the particular character class's type of gun your squads are using.

The Jagged Alliance series has always paid careful attention to the weapon types, the ballistics of each gun, the distant to the target, the terrain, all of the things that make a gun battle realistic.

I'm never thinking, I wonder if the game is going to get one of my merc's killed because of some random number assigned to a specific situation. Everything is modeled right down to the specifics of the situation. So if I die, I know why.

Jagged Alliance 3 has been modernized to compete with the current RTS's of the day. That's good or bad depending on the way you look at this game. I like the perk system, but I can see why people don't like it because it creates situations which can be unfair when the enemy also has perks that are used against you. But to be honest, I never found it to be a problem.

There are some cheesy things to this game that give it a certain sense of nostalgia I have about the old games. The dialog is atrociously in bad form, but somehow it gives the game a certain personality. How the characters interact with each other can be really annoying. For example: Merc's can refuse contracts because someone that character doesn't like is on your team. Merc's can complain about the conditions of some part of a mission, and I am assuming that can cause issues with longevity of your squads.

The targeting system is implemented really well in my opinion. You can target individual body parts, and per chance to hit is based on the damage characteristics of the gun and how far you are from the target. But what's cool is it doesn't give you numbers, just some general information on the chance you might hit. I don't think it has any information on damage.

There are some things in the game that are still an issue, finding ammo and meds is a pain in the ass, but maybe that's how it's supposed to be.

Overall, I think the return of this franchise is off to a great start. I'm really glad they decided to revive this because the modding capabilities of this franchise are endless.

Without that one feature, it makes so much of the game more.. not difficult, but less smooth because now you can sneak your mercs into position, get them all set up for a masterful ambush, and then nope. When  you pop the first one, they all get ""surprised"" and get to move before you do. It's an odd choice that doesn't really add anything to the game except more time to hunt down the runners. I suppose it ups the difficulty, but not really because they rarely do anything useful with that first move, just spread out to mess up your firing lines. Basically ambushes become setting up overwatch on your other mercs then pop the first one, and then they all die just as quick when they get their turn, but it's all automated. Kind of takes the fun out of it.",1691492159,1691492393,True,2,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

[b]+ PROS[/b]

- Nice and decent graphics
- Good and appealing level design
- Good weapon sounds
- You can actually jump over gaps between houses/containers/roofs/cliffs
- You can rob smugglers/diamond trade routes to earn extra cash
- AI seems rather smart than dumb
- Every sector has a nice custom loading/splash screen
- Ricochets look nice
- Weather and time of day influences ""various"" mechanics



[b]- CONS[/b]

- Slightly Overdrawn characters / NPCs
- Graphics slightly too colorful
- Way too few weapons available!
- Major balancing issues with weapons (Sniper is OP)
- Console-like and arcadish UI (you know what I mean..)
- Item/Inventory management is space-based, no weight management, everything has the same weight. Its all about spaces/item slots, defined by the ""Strength""-Skill only. Can have unlimited ammo etc. / strange squad/party-based ammo inventory system, making ammo accessible for all members
- No Backpacks
- No option to sell weapons
- Character always looks the same: Gear/cloths do not alter visual appearance
- No option to do a side roll changing viewing direction (JA2 related, slightly unimportant for this game)
- You cannot set ambush positions when you are attacked on a sector. Your team will need to be placed on a specific spot once the battle starts making previously taken positions useless
- When an enemy/NPC dies outside of your viewing area they will become visible
- Mortar impact circle from enemy is visible  to you though you would never now (should be removed in the two higher difficulty levels)
- You cannot mute Mercs (with a disturbing voice) [/was possible before]
- No sorting option (e.g. by Agility, Dexterity) for Mercs in AIM
- Enemy AI does much more damage vs best-trained militia as the militia does to them (Ammo related?)
- You cannot click on a sector without your selected squad trying to move to it (causes mis-moves!)
- Basement/Underground entries are visible on global map (stairway icon) before you even encounter them, breaking immersion
- Combat challenges from your Mercs set you under pressure and the entire feature feels too ""arcade"" (e.g. kill two enemies in one turn to gain bla bla.. pls not something for this game). There should be an option to turn it off to e.g. gain a few extra points when leveling up
- Enemy/AI runs into harmful gases and suffers (not so intelligent after all ...)
- No option to change the UI scale
- Leaving sector ""operations"" will switch from paused to live
- Perk system is kind of ""meh""
- No true interrupt system in combat
- Maps are mostly quite small
- Kind of repetitive and battle after battle when you hold an outpost where enemies use to cross (looking at you G10 ....  .. ..)
- Game is pushing/forcing you to finish it (not so relaxing...)",1691447346,1691449354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[olist]
[*]Mines get depleted a few weeks after you capture them. They operated for years and would continue working for years if you ignored them, but because you decided to capture the sector, they will run out of diamonds in 2 weeks. 
[*]Militia runs back and forth along fences because they cannot plan their movement for more than one turn. Could the friendly units get the same AI as the enemy but be less skilled? Apparently, not. Instead, we got a bunch of friendly idiots. Somehow, shooting friendlies in the back instantly gives them 40 IQ points when they turn into your enemy.
[*]Backpack slots make no sense. You can choose whether you carry a stack of 10 grenades or one lockpick.
[*]Loot disappears. Developers could make enemies drop all items but make those items poor quality, but no. Instead, they decided that it was better to make the enemy's gear disappear.

I'm not sure if lack of active pause is a good idea. It feels clunky to manage your team in stealth even tho I have only 4 mercs in squad.

There are some annoying things like lack of exclusive fullscreen or dumb ally AI (this one is especialy annoying when they keep running back and forth and you lose time to watch that - had once two militia man going up and down a looooooong crane ladder in port cacao every single turn for a whole long fight).

I only played as long as I did because of the steam workshop and easy access to mods.

The game has way too many issues, I haven't found the story to be all that good and the turn based battles are not strong enough to carry it with all the other issues.
I kept playing the game because I was playing the game (its a loop I get into, sunk cost and all that) and kept hoping that ""one more mod"" would fix it and it would be great. Similar to Battletech 2018 by HBS.

Maybe once this game gets a good full overhaul it will be worth a visit.

It also runs very poorly on a I7 and a 3070.

As a general disclaimer, this all my opinion. I did manage to get 55 hours out of the game so it wasn't a complete loss.

The game needs a better tutorial and it needs to display more information to the player. At least you can get a mod that displays more information about morale and whats going on when you take a shot.

Weapon balance, well its not very good. Already a mod for that.
I don't agree with the way single shot, burst and full auto work. Single shot does 1x20 damage, burst does something like 3x8 and full auto is worse, along the lines of 20x4.
Why? 
 If you miss even a single round of a burst you would be better off taking a single shot and that point you should have just used a sniper rifle instead of an AR. 
Good thing there is a mod to fix that.

Ammo always seems to be limited and the game doesn't have a shop. If you guessed that I had a mod to fix that, correct!

No way to pause and order multiple sneak attacks, mod for that.

Inventory management is really poor, 3 clicks needed to scrap one weapon? No thanks.

Enemies get a free 7 tile movement, why? Because!
They also dance around running back and forth into and out of over-watch, A.I here is very bad. 
If you spot a mine, and then move, they still step on the spotted mine. Why? Path find around it please.

Enemies drop rate is abysmal, good thing there is a mod for that. I think the stock drop rate is only 30% or so. Nothing better than winning a good battle only for half the weapons, ammo and equipment to teleport into space.

You scrap weapons and gather parts to use for different things. Too bad you don't get enough to really play around with the different mods on weapons without adding a mod to get more scrap.
Also, when you make a scope, bi-pod or anything really, its forever attached to that weapon and can never be removed. How absurd.

Topping top that off, if you fail to install the mod, it damages the weapon and you loose the parts.

The I.M.P create a merc is too good to be ignored, especially when you consider that early on no other merc has a good leadership and even later on only Raider has leadership over 90.
By the way, the game never explains that leadership will have a huge impact on map travel speed.
The impact wisdom has on training speed leaves some mercs very lacking.
You have to go look for that info.

Even still, yet other mercs that come in the higher tiers have perks that really don't mesh.
Grizzly is a good example, he has two good perks for heavy weapons build and one random melee perk. Why?

The game is an action focused economy based off agility, the more AP, the more you can do. Part of the lacking tutorial, using take cover gives AP back, the game never mentions that in the tutorial, you have to carefully read the tool tip, however the tool tips don't always give good information, or the full story.
For example, Mr. Fix-it perk gives a major bonus. That doesn't tell me anything, what exactly is a major bonus? Many perks and other things in the game have vague tool tips.

You have to replay the exact same island every time you start the game, boring. 
You start the game, kill the same 3 guys every time, unless you mod for more enemies, talk to the same lady, click through the same lore dump. I could forgive this if it was more interesting.

At least the mercs, with a mod to let everyone speak if they have a line, can add some funny random banter.
If you don't have that mod it picks a random merc to say a line.
Every single time you start a new save.

Speaking of the mercs, some of them are funny, some are cringe, and some are just boring.
Wolf and Fox are funny, sometimes.
Steroid had me snort laughing when he shotgunned a guys head off with his one liner.
At least most of them I can stand and some are funny.

Also, some mercs don't like other mercs and without going outside the game you won't know this, and it may not even occur to check for the morale hit that reduces AP with low morale because Fox doesn't like Steroid.
On the flip side, pairing mercs that like each other is very strong as you gain 1 AP for high morale.

This information needs to be easily accessed in game, who likes and doesn't like who. Others flat out refuse to work with each other.

If you silent/stealth kill a enemy and start combat, despite everyone on your team being hidden the enemies always seem to know what direction to go.
Also, you can get in situations, even without added enemies mod (or any mod), where one enemy will just walk back and forth in the same place forever, even if you exit stealth. Then you gotta hunt them down all over the map, in turn based mode.

Also, you cant change the looks of anyone, no matter what armor you use.  

Some mercs have perks or stats so good that you will use them all game, even if they are annoying.
Live-wire is the best mechanic, MD is the best doctor, Fox is the best stealth opener, Barry is the best explosive expert and the most cost effective merc in the game.
Wolfs perk makes everything in the operations tab 33% faster.

Enemies can be massive bullet sponges, I have seen a few take 100 head shot damage and keep trucking.
Others can yeat themselves halfway across the map and melee hit your mercs for huge damage.
Grenades don't do enough damage. I have had Barry toss two grenades at the same two enemies and they still didn't die.

As for the good things.

The destructible environments are neat.
You can really tailor a weapon to your needs, if you have the parts.
Sometimes the one liners are funny. ""I will fall on them like a tree in the forest!""

The game looks ok, loads fairly quickly.
The turn-based combat is good.
Maps are pretty, some are fairly large.

I cannot recommend this game if you are looking for a serious, well balanced, turn-based game with some light RPG elements.

If you all you want is a fun romp with outlandish characters and a campy story with obvious plot twist, it isn't that bad.

I wasn't expecting the game to a turn-based version of Arma, just a not-too-serious but serious turn-based tactical squad game.

the main drawback is the combat, which i hope can be fixed but im worried that it is just so fundamentally broken that it can never be made to work. the game overall is enough that i keep going back to it, but the combat is frustrating enough that i keep giving up.

other people have explained it better enough, basically it comes down to the number of people claiming the combat is too easy and also those saying its too hard. it just doesnt work the way it seems it should, and the only way to play effectively is to find the few strategies that almost always work and cheese them, and ignore the other 90% of content (like, shooting guys with guns) that don't really work as well. stealth works, sort of, for example, but unless youre prepared to save scum its too unreliable and likely to get you killed. the game plays as if you should try to avoid getting shot (obviously?) while still always having the risk (like in a jagged alliance game!) which might slow down your whole offensive and require you to stop and heal yourself or just completely divert to a hospital. but unless you just snipe from outside of combat range (or are very careful and can stealth kill the entire map) you will get shot, multiple times, usually for not much damage but enough to cause injuries.
the AI makes no effort to use cover or flank or use any tactics at all really. shooting enemies does nothing to weaken or slow them down - arm or leg shots impact aiming or movement for one round but arent generally worth the trouble since any enemy you dont kill by the end of the round will probably hit you. as a result your entire strategy needs to be based around killing as many enemies as soon as possible, rather than, like, pinning some down or flanking or anything you might call ""tactics."" just fixing this might make the game like, three times better, and make other playstyles (and guns that arent single shot rifles) actually worthwhile.

the mercs are well done despite all the JA2 fanboys complaining, though i agree it feels like there should be at least 3-5 more - hopefully they will be adding more (and not as some weird DLC package) -  mostly just the need to start with the cheap mercs means there arent a lot of good options for who to recruit, and you will often end up with the same starting team. there arent enough total to really make letting mercs die in combat (and not save scumming) really a viable option, especially as some deaths will prevent other mercs from ever joining you, for example there's only i think like 4 explosive experts.  it never really felt necessary to upgrade to higher level mercs either except because i had already recruited all the low-tier guys, since you'll end up needing MORE mercs more than just better ones. even the cheapest guys are pretty good , and there aren't any useless or joke mercs like your unusually ruthless reubens or any of the old men. i think the idea here was to make all the mercs pretty decent and potential fan favorites etc but this means you're better off just keeping your starting team. healing even a ridiculous number of wounds only takes at most 2 days as well, so theres no point where you end up firing a merc (losing your medical bonus) just because theyre temporarily useless for combat. making all mercs have a unique skill is a nice though but for the reasons already stated some skills are incredibly useful and others are pointless, again forcing you to mostly choose the same team long-term.

crafting and item management is both less frustrating than JA2 and also simpler and less rewarding - there's no online shop (which is a major complaint but im okay with it - at least i dont spend half the game waiting in the airport for new gear) but the limited inventory space means mid-game you spend a lot of time just looking around for guns you left lying around. upgrading guns takes up a lot more resources for minor bonuses which are negated as soon as you find a better gun, since mods cant be removed or swapped. weapon maintenance, just like medical treatment, is much too simple and in most cases its very easy to keep all your gear at 90+% without spending too much time repairing, and there arent really many interesting things you can make beyond weapon mods and ammo. the lack of inventory spaces also means you dont get to try out a lot of extra gear that might be more useful otherwise, and the lack of speciality gear means looting after battles becomes more of a chore since you dont expect to find much you can use. the whole system could be done better, even if its not bad on its own.

tldr: fun strategy level, but the combat is more ""wasteland 3"" (which i hated, but thats just me) than jagged alliance 2. the options are to cheese stealth/sniping or to rely on save scumming to avoid entire wipes based on one bad round. wishlist it and wait for a sale or at least until some big updates that improve the game (and not make it worse like the last one.)

It seems that the Norton Anti-Virus software that came pre-installed with my recently purchased laptop was causing the issue. Uninstalling it fixed the issue (not sure why I didn't uninstall as soon as the free month was up because in the end I had no desire to use it). One thing to note is that I ended up buying and playing it on GOG just to see if that made a difference (but I had the same exact issue which was fixed by uninstalling the Norton AV software) which is why i still have only ~3h played here on Steam. I have no reason to believe the same fix would not have worked for the Steam version also. So now that I am able to actually enjoy the game, I am happily changing my review status to recommended.

As someone who loved JA2 and played it for almost 2 decades (thanks mostly to mods for so many years playing.

My review is too long already so I wont list everything I love about it, but trust me when I say if you like(d) Jagged Alliance 2, you will love this game. Hands down.



Original Review: 
For some reason, when I close the game, it continues to run as a background process, needlessly using memory. The only way I've found to stop it is to reboot the whole computer. Pressing the STOP button on the steam page doesn't work nor does attempting to end process through the task manager. I have never in  my life experienced another game/program doing this, so I have no idea how to fix it. Once its fixed I will gladly switch to recommended, but until then this is my only option, since I got pushed over 2 hours playtime even though I've only had 1 hour actually in game, because Steam perceives the background process as the game running and thus continued to count it as playtime.",1689356745,1691401620,True,0,0,0.483038425445556641,0,True,False,False

After a bunch of half baked tries in which Jagged Alliance: Back in Action came closest for me, ( Flashback was a massive dissappointment but the studio had a lot of heart and passion for the game) we finally have a worthy follow-up of Jagged Alliance 2. The developers absolutely nailed the vibe of JA2, created new great characters( LIVEWIRE is AMAZING) , the music is great and the voice-actors are pretty close to the originals. 

Gameplay wise: Sniper Rifles are OP in this game, I seriously miss Bobby Rays ( I get the system of buying items in certain maps, but it dumbed down the management. Like at some point I ran out of Lockpicks and I had to get Vicki on board, als inventory space isnt great but OK) 

I'd like to get more options to recruit NPC's. There were some great characters and callbacks in this game. I mean... Major L. E. Oat was just such an amazing callback. 

Also, there's a certain event in the game that can literally destroy all of your progress. They should have put this in the third act or island. It's really gamebreaking and you can accidently run into it. I did, But luckily read through some guides so I skipped it and ignored the place until I felt I was ready... 

I had a great time with the game, it checks all boxes for me what Jagged Alliance game should be. The characters live, their perks and quirks are great. I mean, If you hear Scully talk about his exes, his marriages and his 21 kids... Also the sexual tension between Fox and Wolf, the hatred that Buns had for Fox... the clumsiness and insecure MD... It's absolutely missing some legendary characters from M.E.R.C. as well but I had a blast. 

I'll def come back and play another session later on in the future. Can't wait for an expansion or a follow-up. The license is in very good hands this time.

After years of waiting for a worthy sequel, and hundreds (perhaps thousands) of hours played in JA2 1.13, I delved into JA3 with cautious hope. 

This game feels like a modern love letter to JA2. I wasn't expecting an experience with as many fleshed out systems and gameplay mechanics as it's predecessor, but JA3 gets really close. It does a great job of evoking what the JA2 experience was, but in an updated, more user/beginner friendly package. 

[b] Looks: [/b] 
Being a fan of other isometric strategy games, most of the newer systems in place are familiar and blend well with the developer's interpretation of what a JA experience in this decade should be. That being said, most of the UI art direction falls short for me. The in-game browser looks good, but the email, notes, map and navigation, and combat overlays feel way too modern and ""clean"". This is a shame considering the graphics and environment are very well executed. I'd enjoy a look as boisterous as the character's personalities.

[b] Mercs: [/b]
Hearing the hammed up accent from Steroid for the first time again made me feel like I had reunited with an old friend. Every character brought back feels like they were pulled right out of the field from Arulco. Every time I recruited someone from the old teams, felt like a homecoming. Their chemistry is great and I thoroughly enjoyed the chatter between them. The new mercs fit right in, and stats and perks compliment each other nicely. Great job on this category Haemimont.

[b] Gameplay: [/b]
The early game land-grab rush aspect of JA2 was redone to perfection. I have so much respect for the developers going with the same formula, knowing that a poor execution of such a thing would mean vitriol from newcomers and old fans alike. Making the decision to haphazardly rush to the nearest mine so you can extend the contract on your favorite or essential merc feels the same as it did in 1999. 

Combat feels good, but some fire fights feel like they're missing something. It's like the combat was recreated from a memory of what combat was like in JA2, and the memory is faded. The combat feels much more confined in this sequel's smaller maps. Many innovations made in the past few decades of the genre have been rightfully taken advantage of, lending to a tactile environment, with cover of varying fortitude. Another thing to note is how vastly different the inventory system is in JA3. I am possibly one of the few individuals in gaming who derives great pleasure in organizing my inventory, so the simplification (I miss magazine management) of this system is perhaps my biggest gripe. 

Even with a more in depth weapon customization system, JA3's limited arsenal covers the basics, but not much else. One of the best things about even the vanilla version of JA2 was it's period accurate selection of arms and munitions, and their variety. I miss Bobby Ray's shop dearly. Although compared to modern titles, the weaponry and customization of said weaponry, is sufficient. It's important to note, It's hard for JA3 to come close in this aspect due to the modern technical requirements of adding weaponry to a video game. There's more to putting a weapon in a game now than there was when all a new gun was back in the 90's was a few pictures and potentially new sound byte. 

[b] Conclusion: [/b]
Although it isn't the same merc manager sim as it's famous predecessor, JA2 is no doubt cut from the same cloth. It's greatest triumphs come from doing what the old games did well, but it's worst faults comes from a litany of smaller things that together, really flesh out the experience. 

I know it sounds like an old gamer harping on how this new game isn't the EXACT same as one that came before it, but I write this all, knowing the limitations a smaller studio has in creating something that despite every effort, was going to be compared to and critiqued against many people's most beloved game. Haemimont Games created an experience that evokes the glory days of the franchise, in a title close to my heart. And for that, I thank them. 

P.S. They had to know what they were doing when they added mod support. If JA3 gets even half of the love from the community in the modding department that JA2 did, It has the potential to do the same thing for this title that 1.13 did. Which is to demand thousands of hours of my life, deservedly.",1691361094,1691361094,True,51,0,0.807369589805603027,0,True,False,False

I am a devoted enthusiast of the origin Jagged Alliance game series. I've successfully conquered them on the most challenging difficulty settings.

This new version of the game, Jagged Alliance 3 boasts an excellent gameplay atmosphere, captivating graphics, a compelling musical score, and immersive sound effects. Coupled with a respectable storyline enriched with humorous dialogues, the experience is well-rounded. The camera and character controls are highly refined, accompanied by superb character animations and an adequate level of graphical violence.

Initially, my main critique was directed towards the inventory system, which notably diverges from the traditional inventory setup in Jagged Alliance. Instead, it resembles more of an inventory system from a fantasy RPG rather than a true Jagged Alliance experience. However, as I delved further, the reasoning behind the choice of this inventory system became apparent. Nonetheless, I still hold the belief that an adaptation of the original JA inventory system with certain modifications would have been preferable.

On the whole, this game stands as a commendable successor to its predecessor, and you should take pride in its creation. Having dedicated 130 hours to gameplay and having attained numerous rare achievements, my affection for it remains unwavering.

Nonetheless, I find the inclusion of workshop Mods to be somewhat akin to utilizing a cheating mechanism.

For context, I've played hundreds (if not a thousand) of hours of JA2 (mostly 1.13) and still do. The writing of Ian Currie makes this game a truly fun and surprisingly GREAT game. Granted, I played with mods that helped me get the balance I wanted, but that's another great decision by the Dev team, to support mods on release. The Dev team should also be highly commended; the love they put into trying to make this a faithful successor shows. Can it be better? Yes... and I have no doubt it will, the Devs are already releasing patches sensitive to the community requests and what they don't do, the  great modding community is making up for. For example, reality dictates that when you defeat the enemy, you get their stuff. JA3 drops little in the early game, presumably for balance but it can end up being a grind. Mods step in and allow you to collect all that enemy gear, allowing the player to focus on the story and a higher challenge level rather than simply pursuing kills to get adequately armed. Probably a big surprise to some, but yes, the great JA2 was the same way in the beginning. Enough words, if you like squad and platoon level strategic management and tactical leadership with quirky, retro characters and dialog with lots of gratuitous violence and action, then this game is for you. I spent over 200 hours on a beginning play through and then a second, slower burn where I never reloaded a combat (commando difficulty) and enjoyed (almost) every minute....

Just as I let go the idea that I will ever play a good Fallout game after Bethesda started to run amok with their own interpretation of Fallout, New Vegas arrived and it felt like I'm playing the real, spiritual successors of Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. In the same manner I let go the idea that I will ever play a good Jagged Alliance game and here is Jagged Alliance 3, out of the blue.

To be frank, this game is not (that) good. Parts of it are bad, punishingly bad. Yet, somehow captures most (but not all) of the atmosphere of the classic Jagged Alliance games. In the defense of the developers, they tried hard in most areas, but somehow certain parts fell short. To be brutally honest, if JA1 and JA2 wouldn't occupy such a special place in my heart with all the teenagerhood memories of playing them to death, I am not sure that this review would be positive.

So, if you are a hardcore Jagged Alliance fan, possibly you should skip it, because things are different here. VERY different. But if you can accept that times change and you are open minded toward a new Jagged Alliance game, then you should definitely give it a try. Since despite the myriads of game design and technical issues, somehow it shines through that the developers have a certain respect toward the classic Jagged Alliances games.

If you didn't play Jagged Alliance before, but you like strategy games, then I would recommend to exercise caution.

- Overall, the game is very good
- Fells definitely Jagged Alliance
- Quests are interesting, characters are relatable and truly unique
- Resource management is nice, the idea of saving bullets or using other weapons is nice
- Reworked melee combat, which makes total sense now is super-cool. A merc loaded with stealth and melee perks (I used IGOR) is a fantastic asset, and I dare say is better than an auto-weapon focused marksman (best loadout in JA2) 
- new system of modding weapons is cool from the sense of diversity of accessories, although the fact that they stick to the weapon isn't cool
Now a couple of complaints:
- Very strange balance of automatic weapons - they mysteriously deal less damage in auto mode.
- Few weapons. Definitely need more
- With top level gear, battles aren't very interesting. Would be cool if much stronger enemies spawn towards the end of the game (more armor, cooler weapons). 
- Even defeating best enemies, very few loot.

Weapons feel too similar to each other. eg all assault rifles feel close to each other, all smgs but one feel the same, Snipers and machine guns are ok.  Needs more chips in the game.

It's all here; the desperate plea from the ousted ruler of a developing country, the truly turn-based chin stroking (which in reality plays out as constant head shots with sniper rifles), the useless pistols, the merc banter, the personalities, the preposterous gluing of ridiculous tubes, the vying for resources to keep the payroll going; it really is all here, baby, and Haemimont Games done good. It seems they actually have tried to do something with the pistols, though - and it [i]sort of[/i] works. But more on that later.

There's no question; this IS the true successor to Jagged Alliance 2. And what a relief - it could have been so bad. Instead? It's actually great. Really great. 

But it's early days; I'm on my second play-through, and one or two scripting bugs have reared their heads, but nothing game-breaking. No spoilers, though - just play it. If you're an original fan, you won't be disappointed. Lost heart with all the weak realtime/pause efforts of the past? Yeah, bin that - this is the real deal. 

I'll admit, it does take a while to acclimatise to the 3D-ness of it all; somehow, Jagged Alliance doesn't feel quite right without either eight-bit sound effects, and taking place on a putting green, or the equivalent Windows 95 sprite jamboree, unfolding in a similarly charming one-storey playground. It's something of a culture shock, but I found I had to suspend my disbelief. I recall purchasing, and playing (for a few, disappointed hours) 'Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge' in 2007, and thinking 'Whoever made this just doesn't get it'. As I think everyone did. 

[h2]Story Time[/h2]

Yes, there is the JA2 1.13 mod, and yeees, there is a whole multitude of others, not limited to 7.62mm (awful), Silent Storm (great in its own right, but terrible production), and uncountable other imitators. Let's not forget, Jagged Alliance itself was inspired by the UK's Gollop brothers' early games on the ZX Spectrum; Rebelstar Raiders, Chaos, Rebelstar, Laser Squad - all completely seminal. But Jagged Alliance did something different - it gave us characters. And a story. 

It's this unique, quirky, action film, Canuck-tinged Americana that gives Jagged Alliance its identity. Mercifully, and gloriously, perhaps in no small part due to the contributions of the originals' creator Ian Currie, it's still there. Arguably, the narrative plays an even greater part than it did in JA2, with certain events designed to whip you along and keep up the pressure. Interestingly, this time round, we remain firmly in front of the fourth wall, seeing and knowing only what we, as the commander of the mercenary unit, could possibly see and know. Gone are the third-person expositionary cutscenes (Elliot/Deidranna), and I'm unsure whether I miss them; they did add a certain, campy, B-movie quality to the whole thing, but on the other hand, you knew who you were dealing with the whole time, which diminished the mystery, somewhat, leaving no room for any plot twists or Easter eggs. Well, rest assured, there are one or two of those this time round.

[h2]Balancing Act[/h2]

In terms of balance, it's apparent the creators have rolled up their sleeves and thought 'Right then - let's sort this out', which is both a good and a bad thing. I'll explain: we now have a roster of only about 40 hireable mercs, down from the original's 60, and JA2's 72, which seems, at first consideration, a bit lean. On the one hand, part of the enjoyment of the first two games was the possibility that you might try a run with one, or any number of the most useless characters available, just to see if it could be done. How far can I get with Pops McGillicutty and Mary-Beth Wilkens? Well, that's no longer really an option. Under the hood, much of the original rosters comprised duplicates and dead weight, but again, this provided options, and importantly, flavour. What we have now is a stripped-down, hard core of useful mercs, none of whom could be affixed the ignominious moniker of C-lister. There are some new characters in the lower ranks (mercs are now presented in tier groups), but as usual, for some reason, any attempt by anyone to create a new JA merc results in a slightly dour, boring, and uninspiring affair. I haven't played them all yet, but the ones I've tried haven't impressed me much. It could be that all the familiar movie tropes have already been exhausted with the other characters, but we shall see. 

However, reassuringly, when it comes to favourites, the gang is all here; Ivan, Fidel, Tex, Vicky, Scully - all present and correct. Many of the characters and relationships have been slightly reimagined, with some of the dialogue and quips between them actually surpassing that of their predecessors. For example, having Wolf, Fox, Ice, Grizzly, Steroid and Magic on the same squad results in some great little moments. Disappointingly, other great characters like Static, Trevor, Malice, and Stephen are absent. Bizarrely, Scully is now 'sort of' Australian (I guess someone had to be since Trevor got the chop), and as ridiculously as ever, it still sounds as though Ice is voiced by a white guy. But I guess that's the joke - maybe? Tropic Thunder, anyone? ;-)

The upshot of all this is that mercs who had previously been also-rans (think 'Berry Ooongah' and Ernie 'Red' Spragg) now come to the fore, and in reality become your only real choices in certain departments. The addition of perks brings a new dimension to the game, further emphasising the uniqueness of each personality, so it really is a double-edged sword; what we've lost in numbers, we've gained in stronger individuals, and on the whole, it works. 

Among other long-standing problems they've attempted to address, is that of pistols, knives, and melee. We know what I'm talking about, don't we? They were completely useless. Well, they're now [i]somewhat[/i] not. I still haven't completely cleared a sector with stealth and melee, but it feels like it might be possible. Confoundingly, there are no rocks to chuck, so splitting up groups of guards is still an issue - I'd welcome any suggestions!

[h2]Final Sector[/h2]

Honourable mentions for the art department, sound design, and score - all most excellent. The music, especially, is magnificent, sometimes drawing on previous themes (combining an orchestra with slide guitar), then bringing new flavours and feels, all of which add to and complement the atmosphere perfectly. 

If you're a fan of the original series and are undecided, I'd give this a resounding thumbs up - you won't be disappointed. Even newcomers will find a great turn-based tactical/strategy game here - it stands on its own two feet; you don't need to have played the previous instalments to get any of what's here. Gone are the dark years of second-rate, realtime/pause nonsense; what we have is a great return to form for the series. It looks as if Jagged Alliance really is back in action, and back in really safe hands with Haemimont Games. 

PS a plea to devs! Devs, if you're listening, you know what I'm on about:

This is a great continuation,true to its predecessors.

Fun times with interesting tactics like the old games.

I find myself playing some maps over and over... trying different tactics etc.. this is a Hallmark of a well made game.

EDIT: after more then 50 hours,im still captivated.Theres still tons of stuff for me to experiance,the return value of this game is huge,and the Devs deserve every cent in their amazing investment.
Sitting at work contumplating my next move in JA3.
This game is amazing,really recommended to people who enjoyed the previous games and or like turn base combat with funny streak.

Last Edit:

After 97 hours, I’ve finished the game.
Now as I look back, it was great fun and addictive.
However I have to agree with the folks saying this isn’t JA2.
JA3 felt watered down. I missed the hardcore and grinding I had in JA2.
Also don’t get the complaints about making money..
I finished the game with over 6 Mil...
I hadn’t felt that money had any real purpose, taking over Mines only contributing to lowering difficulty with encounters.
There weren’t any surprises ,combat wise (again felt watered down and simplified, copy paste so to speak, only parameters differ), there weren’t ,like enemies with different tactics or mechanism etc.
You fight mostly legion, but then you encounter other groups, other mobs, most of them only differ by been HP sponges, which makes the combat less fun and more repetitive.
All enemies were the same from start till the end, which I mean they ""act"" the same mostly, or just didn’t seem like with much depth. In the last fights, it just felt like “let’s raise the difficulty by lowering all the rng success”.
Like all the shots I made landed with less HP and misses while the enemies always hit their mark, always hit big numbers and are agile beyond belief.
The last place I went was to Corazone, that underground battle felt really dumb. It’s hard to explain... 
I just thrown everything I had and rolled over the enemies, though it was not a fun experience(all my mercs which were top marksman suddenly reverted to novice status and started missing and like I said even hitting enemies wasn’t rewarding, low hp lost on enemy hit, thrown multiple grenades for 25 dmg hit? Soldiers made out of stone or what? The environment looked awesome: it gets completely obliterated, while those top super soldiers just dance through the wreckage mostly unharmed.
So super addictive fun and funny game, but watered down JA2 experience, made me miss JA2 hard.",1689347426,1691205068,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
Sound Track, damn fine.  Especially the hopeful ones in certain villages after liberating them.  
Cynthia ""Fox"" Guzman.  Awesome that they included a ""bro"" chick who's just as raunchy as I am.  Thank you devs!
This game doesn't attempt ""re-make"" a genre.  It sticks to a tried and true method whilst being tongue in cheek.
The movement and attack single click is nice for close range combat.
Plot is easy to follow, with just enough goofiness to make it entertaining.
Graphics are good, even on mid settings.  It feels and looks like Jagged Alliance.

Cons:
Some of the side quests are not so straight forward.  Once you figure them out, it's like having a ""Duh, of course"" moment.
Inventory can become bloated FAST.  Beware of hoarding explosives.
The Mortar is underwhelming, and turn delayed.  Rendering it weaker than a mortar should be.
I was hoping for a bit more zombie and sci-fi/horror encounters and quests.
The whole super soldier quest line seems like a massive missed opportunity.  Maybe it will be a whole expansion/DLC?
I.M.P. Portraits, very few to pick from,  Hopefully they will add more.
A character customization screen for player avatar would be awesome.

1084160,143407192,76561198009032876,0,3,3520,0,3520,1690491314,"Just a bit on my background with the genre – I’ve played all major XCOM titles since the reboot, a bit of Phoenix Point but in any case, Silent Storm remains one of my all-time favourite games, the best one for me in this genre for sure. While definitely substantially different, I’ve also played tons of Commandos and Desperados which are obviously not turn-based but still similar at least in terms of coordinating a squad and setting up ambushes.
I thought briefly outlining my background would make sense because I somehow ended up not having played JA2. I do recall friends recommending it to me at the time but I guess I was too busy playing Heroes of Might and Magic III. What I’m getting at is that a bit too many people criticise this game for not being a modern equivalent of JA2 and I think that’s not fair. I do definitely compare it to XCOM and Silent Storm but I also try to judge it on its own merits. While I appreciate the fact that JA2 is seen as a classic, a game can still be a worthy successor with some innovations, especially more than 20 years later.

A few common points of criticism towards the game and my thoughts on why I DISAGREE WITH THOSE:
• No active pause – I think that being able to set up perfect ambushes with your whole squad by executing a number of orders in perfect sync would ruin the experience for me. And by the way, you can still set up brilliant ambushes by, say, planting a timed explosive and putting most of your squad in overwatch before the turn-based combat starts so that the enemy still suffers a lot of damage in the repositioning phase.
• No chance to hit displayed – while the option has already been provided by virtue of an official mod, I seriously don’t get it what so many people are complaining about. You are explicitly shown tons of information about what could affect your chances to hit positively or negatively, sometimes up to 9-10 such data points in my experience. If that were not enough, you actually get a visual indication of whether your attempt is in the sweet spot based on all those factors combined with range. I’ve had tons of fun with this system and I enjoy the game much better like that
• Quirky controls – I’ve found it way more easier to go to a different floor as compared with XCOM2, for example. So controls are fairly intuitive and responsive from my point of view, especially appreciating the fact that so much is going on that I can’t really blame the game for sometimes not being fully clear as to what exactly I’m trying to do. In other words, in light of the complexity of what you could do on the map, I’ve had no major issues with controls and no complaints about that, respectively.
• Enemy knowing where you are – I’ve noticed some reviewers have claimed that the AI knew more than it should. While I appreciate the fact they may have had such experience, I haven’t. I’ve had a number of situations where I’m openly attacking the enemy with part of the squad while some other mercs stay hidden to attack from the flank. It seemed that the AI was only aware of my openly attacking mercs and wasn’t anticipating the hidden mercs that were sometimes literally in front of its way. If they’d been able to do a 1-hit kill with a sniper with a suppression, they’d remain hidden and the AI would definitely still be unaware of where they were.
• Ragdoll physics can be subpar; what your merc wears doesn’t change their looks – both statements are correct and I seriously couldn’t care less. I’m here for the gameplay which is brilliant – if that’s at the expense of some more eye candy, then so be it.

What I particularly liked about the game:
• Good and challenging AI even at the lowest difficulty
• I did explore every single tile on the map and I still see a great replayability potential for that type of a game. It’s very much non-linear indeed and you can progress with even some of the major milestones in a campaign by approaching them in a different order. Your decisions do indeed matter in the long term and I bet I could see a lot more from the game even in a third or fourth replay – the point is that it’s not only alternative choices (where I could just explore 100% of those alternatives in a second playthrough) but rather your choices cumulatively also lead to very different outcomes. Side quests are brilliant and very immersive.
• The game came out extremely polished and with more than enough content for it to be called a worthy day one release. That used to be the standard twenty years ago but not really the case anymore so it’s very much worth praising the developers and the publishers for that. I’ve played for more than 60 hours so far and I haven’t had a single crash or any major bug spoiling my experience. The game is also full of so much content that it’s most certainly a fully completed launch – unlike many other moder releases that are launched but only become playable after months and potentially even some paid DLCs.
• Love the projectile ballistics!

After praising the game so extensively and to be fair, a couple of things I missed for this to be the perfect game:
• Lacking tutorials – as a newcomer to the game and the series (but definitely not to the genre), I gave up on my first playthrough after about 10 hours because I’d made some fundamental strategy mistakes. I then spent about an hour of watching videos on YouTube with titles like “5 major mistakes to avoid when playing JA3”, “10 things to know”, etc. At that point, I felt like I knew the game well enough and had tons of fun with my next full 50-hours completionist playthrough. Nevertheless, a proper engaging in-game tutorial would’ve been appreciated. I did my best to try to read all of the text just-in-time tips but felt overwhelmed with the walls of text at some point. But that’s less of an issue for me at the end of the day. If having a game that polished and so much full of content at launch is at the expense of the more in-depth tutorials, I’m ok with that now that I’ve mastered it already anyway.
• I mentioned already that I love the projectile ballistics but as much as I was hyped about the destructible terrain, I must say Silent Storm still remains unmatched in that respect. Yes, many objects and parts of the terrain are indeed destructible but I couldn’t help but think all the time how Silent Storm was far superior in that respect. Don’t get me wrong – destruction is good, I’m happy it’s there in the first place, it’s just simply not as absolutely brilliant and fun as it was in Silent Storm.

All in all, this is a solid 9/10 for me. I somehow ended up getting to know about this game less than 24 hours before it was released. I guess I’m lucky because I got hyped up so quickly, pre-ordered it immediately and then only had to wait for less than a day to start playing it. I’ve had tons of fun with it and any content DLC or expansions will be an immediate pre-order for me.

I get it that some people may disagree with me that it’s an absolute gem but given that the choice on Steam is between recommending the game or not, I think that opting for NOT recommending the game is a crime at least as severe as someone kidnapping President LaFontaine.",1691176455,1691176455,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Sure it has its flaws. Ammunition management is a bitch in JA3. Sometimes the characters run into spotted mines. But there is really nothing severe to complain about. Something like that got really rare these days.

The tactical overview section is just as interesting as I remember it, with plenty of interesting events to uncover, it's worth my time to investigate each square on the map. The weapons are fun, and the many perks/skills really help to shape the character of each merc, as each one will be usable in a slighly different way, depending on their perks.

That said, I am not very charmed by the banter. It's not bad but its just not that funny, and feels out of time.

I understand that this is a ""homage"" to the characters are inspired by action heroes from the 90s, which is fine but just does not feel that relevant anymore. It's also feels like the writing has opted for a safe approach, meaning that the lines uttered by your mercs would suit a 90's movie, but with all the teeth (i.e. overt racism and sexism) taken out. Which, to be clear, is great, I'm really not for bringing that back in any way. But the decision to play it safe, while also sticking to the material. makes the banter kind of dull most of the time and even cringe worthy at times.

I was hoping to see a more modern take on the action movies of a more recent time (blood diamond, inception, fast and furious etc). There are so many great action movies to parody, so I am a little dissapointed that the devs chose to pick te same setting as the predecessor.

Again, it is not a breaking point for me at all and I would still HIGHLY reccomend this game for its solid mechanics and colorful characters.",1691157376,1691157376,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was a special game before I spoke English, and my brother guided me through the game. It was a magical time, being amazed at Ivan, finding Brenda before she was killed, and being terrified of eels in the water. This tradition continued years later when Jagged Alliance 2 was released, and again playing together with the 1.13 mod. Saying I was disappointed by the follow-up games, is understating it. 

When I heard of Jagged Alliance 3, I was sceptical. The track record of sequels wasn't good. But I read the Dev Logs and they made me hopeful. The Devs were clearly fans of the series like my brother and I were. The thought of a coop campaign convinced me. My brother and I pre-ordered. A risky move I know, but in this case I think it paid off.  

I can't say for a full play through, but after 24+ hours I think I can make a decent assessment of the game. In short, I like it. A lot. It's not perfect, but unlike the previous games it FEELS right. They obviously put a lot of love in the game and just enough references to previous games to really tie it as a legit 3rd installment of the franchise. 

The Good:
I love the individual mercenaries, their voice lines, their character and the way they involve themselves in conversations. They feel unique in just the right ways.
 
Combat feels complete with sufficient options to solve each situation. You have a good toolkit to approach each fight, playing to the strengths of each merc. The weapons so far are just diverse enough, with options to modify them for the role they play in your team.   

Stealth plays really well. This is not a thing that JA games got right, it being nigh non-existent in JA1 and only slightly viable in JA2 1.13+. Here I enjoy having my sniper team locate isolated targets and take out patrols before engaging the main group of enemies with ambush tactics. 

Mod-support! The Devs put in mod support from day 1, which will add longevity to any game. I love this as they really approved of the 1.13 mod and their developers and just said: We want this available from day 1. 

The Bad: 
The combat maps are really small. While this makes the game and conflicts play faster (unlike for example searching for that last enemy in the large JA2 maps), it makes the world feel small as well. Jagged 2 maps felt wide and strategic positioning was important. You were searching and hunting and avoiding  

Merc selection feels limited. The creators did their best to get all the important names from the previous games with a few new names sprinkled in. But for some reason it doesn't feel like the variety in JA2. I think part of this is due to their division into classes (Mechanic, Explosives, Marksman, Medic and Generalist), which takes away from their uniqueness. 

Conclusion:
All in all I am really enjoying the game, and it holds up as a high quality squad-based turn-based RTS and worth a purchase if you enjoy these kinds of games or are a fan of the franchise who is still on the fence.",1691145289,1691145289,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would give it an overall 8/10 - pretty good mechanically, has some interesting aspects story- and choice-wise, but can become a bit tedious at times in the mid-game to end-game - probably depending on your playstyle though.
Here are ny thoughts:

Strategic layer is good - fair amount of depth and choice in terms of how to go about your objectives. You can go into tactical mode on every non-water tile and usually - even on the tiles that aren't technically points of interest - there's more going on than just loot.
Tactical layer has 2 modes - stealth (RTS style) and combat (turn-based). Remaining in stealth as long as possible is very beneficial. It's a pretty godd mechanic, though - as usual - it's not easy to order characters around simultaneously around the edges of detection. There's a lot of depth in combat with stances, using different weapons and armor, characters having different abilities etc. That makes it pretty hard at the start, but when you get the hang of it and find your playstyle it feels pretty good.
Operations are a really neat idea IMO. It's something non-combat that your mercs do on a tile on the startegic map - they're usually based on a specific skill (the price and the time it takes). They contain (but are not limited to) training or healing your mercs, repairing gear, scouting, crafting explosives and ammo, training local militia.
Skills, perks and abilities of your mercs are pretty important. You tend to have to pay more for better ones. Some mercs can be dreadfully slow or really bad at shooting - which makes them a lot weaker in regular combat, but usually are pretty good at something else which may or may not be better for the team. Some abilities - including unique ones - are really useful, others tend to be absolutely useless IMO.
Picking the right gear (and keeping it in god condition) is really important for making mercs fill cetain roles - like a stealth sniper or a heavy gunner. What's also fairly important is modding weapons which can just make it better or transform it to be more versatile or more specialised. Modding mechanic is easy to overlook but really helpful - especially to complement mercs' skills.
Story is not bad, it's there - not the main focus of the game IMO. The writing is fairly stereotypical and kinda edgy. I like that the world is fairly grey (in terms of morals) and there are a lot of lucrative but morally dubious opportunities.
There are a lot of side stories going on - you may take part or not. Some are cool and interesting, others (few) are barely more than tedious fetchquests.",1691144165,1691144165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

CQC is highly frowned upon unless you use a bolt action, Why? because automatic weapons suffer from 50% + damage nerf for burst fire and a 80% nerf to automatic fire. the DEVs firmly believe that shooting someone with an AK 15 times (the number of rounds fired in the fullautomatic action) should deal less than half the damage of a single shot from a Kar98. Now don't get me wrong the Kar98 is historically a powerful rifle but if you think 15 7.62x39 rounds are gonna do less damage i'd love to test it on you and see...

Burst fire does afford about a 20% increase in damage for 3 rounds vs a single shot but is you miss one of the three you do less than a single shot. Makes compelete sense as long as you don't think about it.

lets go to the final straw and why I'm writing this review, DEVS high on coke and listening to their snipers only meta minority decided to take the last decent automatic weapon system the only unique one in the game and NERF it into the ground. Yep I'm talking about squad automatic weapons or light machine guns the realistically highest casualty producing weapons a squad will have access to.

These used to have the absurd 50% damage nerf, fire in 8-10 round bursts and require you to be prone to set them up in an over-watch or sector of fire, this requires a merc with good strength to operate effectively and even better a specific trait  to reduce action point cost. The trade off for the trait, high strength, and marksmanship and high vulnerability to flanking maneuvers was a deadly killing machine capable of holding a sector and cutting most targets down in a burst. you could with the trait and high agility fire 3 bursts or 2 and a reload during your turn, then make 5 interrupts within your sector during the opposing turn. With the right attachments you could deal upwards of 120 damage at 12 rounds fired yes this rapidly burns through ammo which was another downside to these you need a immense ammo pool for even one.

Now after all that coke and poor decision making along with Grima Wormtongue (sniping only meta minority players) slithering in their gullible ears the DEVS have taken it upon themselves to reduce the damage a further 50% from were it was at down to an atrocious 25% of its listed damage, given that multiple hostile classes were already surviving the previous damage at 120 you are basically better off using a pistol for DPS now as you can't break more than 60 damage without a lot of other conditions, perks etc. even then you cant get close to the previous damage. 

next sense nerfing the damage into the ground wasn't enough to punish players for using anything other than a bolt action the DEVS high on the whispers of deceit from our lovely Grima Wormtongue decided that you had to now decided if you wanted to attack on your turn or have a couple interrupts on theirs, to be clear you will get a total of 3 maybe 4 attacks half of what was previously available and this is only if you have done nothing before even a single action point used will cost you a burst. in all the total reduction to outgoing damage from a machine-gun is 75% less than before you have half the shots and half the damage dealt for 25%  weapon effectiveness.

what this means is using a LMG requires more action points than any other weapon can only be used under specific conditions (prone) requires you to set it up after going prone so that you can deal less damage than any other weapon in the game with the same number of possible attacks and no unique features other than being the most costly and least effective.",1691144125,1691144125,False,162,35,0.691784918308258057,18,True,False,False

تدور أحداث اللعبة في عالم خيالي اسمه Grand Chien، واللي لسوء الحظ، سادت عليه الفوضى بعد اختطاف الرئيس من قبل جماعة مجهولة. بنت الرئيس المخطوف Emma قامت بتعيين جماعة من المرتزقة من منظمة اسمها Adonis.. وانت بدورك كلاعب، راح تعمل على إدارة هذي الجماعة من خلال ابرامك لعقود تعيين مع عدد من الأفراد لانضمامهم للمرتزقة، واللي راح تقوم أيضاً بارسالهم في عدد من المهام بهدف انقاذ الرئيس وارجاع الأمن والاستقرار للدولة.

هذي باختصار القصة واللي أشوفها بسيطة، ولا يمكن حرقها لانها راح خلال أول ربع ساعة من بدايتك للعبة. ولكن.. اللي ودي أقوله، اني لقيت Haemimont Games للأمانة لغمو كل فرد بامكانك ضمه للمرتزقة بسيرة خاصة وقصة مميزة تتناسب مع مواصفاته. وهذا الشي بحد ذاته.. بدالي وكانه امتداد كافي للقصة.  


Gameplay:

مثل ما ذكرنا سلفاً، فاللعبة هي لعبة إستراتيجية من منظور الـ Isometric و هو المنظور اللي دايم يجي من فوق زاوية.. يسمونه المنظور متساوي القياس. وانت راح تلعب دور القائد اللي يلقي الأوامر لمجموعة أفراد من المرتزقة. وطبعاً على حسب منو تختار تضم لفريقك راح يكون بحوزتك مجموعة متغيرة من الأسلحة والعتاد والقدرات. لازم بهذي المجموعة تستكشف المنطقة وتحاول تحصد كل المصادر والكنوز اللي ممكن تكسبها. فيه شخصيات صديقة بامكانك الخوض معاهم بمحاثات، وحسب ما جرت العادة بجزء كبير من الألعاب. فاختياراتك لسلوك المحادثة وتوجيهك لمسارها ممكن تنتج عنها آثار مختلفة. هذا الشي بحد ذاته كافي لمنحك قيمة لإعادة اللعبة لاختياراتك لمسارات ثانية ورؤية النتايج. طبعاً تشوب هذي الحملات مواجهات مع جماعة الـ Legion.. واللي ماراح يترددون باشهار السلاح عليك بمجرد اكتشافهم لوجودك. بشكل جداً جريء، اللعبة تمنحك اختيار أسلوب لعبك. فعندك امكانية المواجهة وتبادل اطلاق النار مباشرة، أو التخفي والتخلص من أعدائك بصمت. 

وهذا طبعاً يشير بان الأسلحة اللي عندك بامكانك اجراء التعديلات عليهم بما يتناسب مع أسلوب لعبك.. تقدر تركب كاتب صوت مثلاً، أو سكوبات تمنحك القدرة على الرمي من مسافة بعيدة أو حتى بعض التعديلات على قطع السلاح للزيادة من دقة الرمي. 

واختيارك للمسافة ضروري باللعبة، بحيث انك لو بادرت بالهجوم.. راح يظهر لك عداد يبينك لك مدى المسافة بينك وبين العدو، الشي اللي ساعدني جداً بتحديد مسارات كل شخصية على حسب امكانيتها في الرمي سواء من بعيد أو قريب. 

وكذلك بنفس الأهمية، منح اللعبة لك امكانية تحديد الجزء من جسم العدو اللي ودك ترميه.. لكل جزء مدى حساسية معين يحدد مدى الضرر اللي ممكن يصيبه. وله بعد مستوى دقة استثنائي. اللي خلاني أقول عنه استثنائي لانه مختلف عن باقي هذا النوع من الألعاب اللي تظهر لك نسبة مئوية تعزز عندك حس الحساب أكثر من كونها محاكاة واقعية لوضع القتال. لأن أثناء القتال، المقاتل يعمل حساب أمور مثل: هل الجزء اللي يحاول يرميه ظاهر، أو غير ظاهر.. ممكن بسبب عائق بينك وبينه. قد يكون هذا الخصم محتمي ورى حاجز أو حامي من نوع معين، أو قد يكون ماخذ وضعية دفاعية تعطيه قدر من الحماية. بالإضافة لان عوامل مثل مجال الرؤية سواء انت تقاتل في حالات طقس صعبة، أو في صبح او ليل.. الشي اللي يخلينا كذلك نشير ان الوقت يلعب دور مهم باللعبة. 

فبدال لا اللعبة تعزز أو تختبر مدى القدرة الحسابية للاعب.. هي من خلال هذا السيستم الفاقد للنسب تخليه ينغمس ويخوض غمار الحرب الفعلية.. اللي القياس تلعب فيه نوع من الصدفة والنتائج الغير متوقعة. قد يظن البعض ان هذا عيب باللعبة ولكني أشوف انه اختيار تصميمي ناجح متعمد لرفع مستوى التحدي في المواجهات. 

وبالنسبة للتحدي.. فاللعبة تأكدو مطورينها ان يكون فيها قدر عالي من التحدي، يعني.. ومع اني مابي أقولها، الكلمة اللي أنا وانتو عارفينها.. واعذروني لو قلتها، أتمنى محد يزعل علي.. الزبده، اللعبة هي السولز لايك حقت الألعاب الاستراتيجية ذات الأدوار. خلاص قلناها.

اذا كانت هذي أول تجربة لك لهذا النوع من الألعاب، راح تشوف ان منحنى التعلم فيها عالي.. بمعنى ان من كثرة الخيارات والسلطة المتاحة لك كقائد.. مع عدد الأفراد اللي تحت امرتك، والعدد الكبير من الوضعيات اللي يمكنهم اتخاذها، بسهولة راح تحس انك مفحم. خاصة ان اللعبة ماشوف انها موفرة مود توتوريال مناسب فبداية اللعبة. ما هي الا مجرد رسايل hints & tips متفرقه.. هني وهناك، وبمرات كثيرة ما شفت انهم تفوقو بتوقيت ظهور هذي التعليمات حتى. مرات يعلموني شي جداً متقدم فبداية اللعبة.. أنا للحين ماني قادر استوعبه، ومرات بسوي شي بسيط مثل معالجة أفرادي.. أقعد أعاني وما اعرف شلون لعدد من المراحل، بس عشان يعلموني بوقت متاخر من اللعبة عن الطريقة. 
بالمقابل، انت بصدد عدد، غالباً كبير من الأعداء.. ما يرحمون، حتى بأقل مستوى صعوبة موفر. فلازم أثني على مستوى الذكاء الاصطناعي عندهم. وهذا اللي خلاني أتاكد ان التحدي باللعبة فعلاً عالي.

طبعاً سرعان ما يكبر فريقك وتضطر توزيعهم لأكثر من فرقه للسيطرة على أكبر قدر ممكن من الأراضي، بعضها غير سكانية، وبعضها سكانية.. ومنها الموانئ والمناجم. الخصم بدوره راح يكون بوضعية مقاومة دائمة ضدك وراح يحاول باستمرار اعادة احتلال المناطق اللي سطيت عليها.. وفجأه، راح تشوف ان مجرد الادارة صارت تحدي بحد ذاتها. 

كل هذي التلاحمات تصير على نطاق واسع يغطيها منظور خاص، اسمه الـ Sat View أو منظور الستلايت، وهو جزء من ثيم خاص كلاسيكي لواجهة كمبيوتر راح نتكلم عنها لما نسولف عن الجانب الفني الرسومي للعبة.. منظور الستلايت هذا يلعب دور الخريطة اللي تستعرض لك جميع الأراضي في اللعبة، للأسف أسلوب التحكم في هذا المنظور وواجهاته وطريقة اصدار القوائم بساطتها ما تؤهلها لأداء الغرض بعد تخطيك منتصف اللعبة تقريباً.. عشان يكون التحكم سلس كان لابد من ابتداع أسلوب تحكم أفضل من الحالي.


Graphics:

وبالنسبة للحديث عن الجانب الفني الرسومي للعبة، فجرافكس اللعبة ما ابهرني، لاني ماشفت فيه اي شي غير مسبوق بالعكس حسيت ان الجرافك ديزاينرز متعمدين يحدون من الجودة العالية للجرافكس.. اللي متعودين عليها بهذا الجيل من الألعاب، عشان يحافظون على الستايل البسيط هذا، واللي للأمانة ما كان سيء. 

ولكن المميز بالنسبة لي، هو اتخاذ اللعبة لجيل أفلام الأكشن من حقبة الثمانينات كثيم عام لها. وصراحة أعتقد انها تبنت هذا الثيم بشكل جميل ومميز.. له لمسه خاصة، يمكنك من تمييز اللعبة من خلال جوها العام. 

وفيه لمسات بسيطة أنا صراحة أقدرها مثل مؤثرات رمي الرصاص والفيزيائية اللي تتدمر فيها البيئة المحيطة بسبب أي رمية أو تفجير. واللي صراحة فاجأني لاني ما توقعت من لعبة آدوار انها تحتوي على بيئة تتفاعل معاك. أغلب هذي الالعاب اللي يتأثر بس الهدف اللي تختار تصويبة. لاحظ ان هذي المؤثرات البصرية تلعب دور فعلي بنتائج المواجهات.. مثلاً لا تعتقد ان وهج الرصاصة مجرد مؤثر بصري انما هي رصاصة حية فعلية قد تصيب زملائك أو حتى تسبب أثر جانبي لعدو غير مستهدف.  

وصل اصرار المصممين على لمسة الثمانينات الخاصة الى ان واجهة الاختيارات هي عبارة عن واجهة لابتوب.. او كمبيوتر شخصي قديمة.. كلاسيكية زرعت احساس النوستلاجيا داخلي بشكل دافي ومميز. وهي نفسها اللي بامكانك خلالها تتعامل مع كل العقود المتوفرة للأفراد المقاتلين.

واللي أحب أذكر ان البعض منهم سهل التعامل مع الاخر.. والبعض راح تجد صعوبة بالتعامل معاه بسبب عدائيته مع أحد الأعضاء.. الشي اللي حسسني ان الأعضاء أِشبه بالأشخاص الحقيقيين.. وهذا يعطي لمسة انسانية واقعية لاسلوب الإدارة.


Music:

موسيقى اللعبة هي أكثر شي وراني ان مطورين اللعبة عارفين شقاعد يسوون، ولأي مدى ممكن يروحون عشان يحققون رؤيتهم. 

الموسيقى فيها نكهة ثمانينية حادة واللي كان يميز موسيقى هذيك الحقبة هو عنصر الأكشن القوي فيها. بمعنى ان انا ماعندي سوى الانبهار من ناحية الموسيقى أثناء أحداث الأكشن والمواجهات. وأنا أسمع الموسيقى، أقدر أجزم ان اللي اشتغل عليها مو مجرد composer، انما orchestra كامل.. فعليك اتخيل قيمة الميزانية اللي تم صرفها على الجانب الموسيقي.

هذا بالإضافة لوجود بعض المقطوعات الهادية اللي تخفف من رتم السرعة في عنصر الأكشن، مو بس جذي ولكن للغناء الجميل نصيب في مقاطع اللعبة.. أتكلم عن هذيك الأغاني اللي تكون في لغة أجنية، بهاللعبة أنا قادر أميز ان الأغاني أفريقية بس ماني قادر أحدد من وين… بعضها خلاني من دون مبالغة ودي بس أبقى واقف أتسمعها. 

أنا ما أكن الا الاحترام للألعاب اللي تهتم للجانب الموسيقي، لا سيم اللعبة، اللي ماعندي أي تعليق سلبي على موسيقاها.


Content:

تحتوي اللعبة على أكثر من نظام للعب غير الـ Campaign.. فيه نظام الملتيبلاير واللي من صدور اللعبة الى وقت نزول هذي المراجعة ما اشتغل معاي. ونظام المودات واللي لحسن الحظ تم تفعيله بعد ٤ أيام من تاريخ صدور اللعبة. بدت لي المودات وكآنها أقرب للـ Cheat Codes … بعضها ماله داعي، والكثير منها يكسر اللعبة أصلاً.. وقلة من المودات فقط اللي أعتبرها مودات جيدة على أحسن تقييم. أقصد اني كنت أتطلع لهذا النظام وللأسف ما كان بقدر التطلعات. طبعاً أياً كان مستواه في الوقت الحالي، اللي يميز هذا النظام انه دائماً وأبداً قابل للتطوير والتحسين منه.

أما الـ Campaign، واللي بهاللعبة يعتبر أهم نظام، بامكانك تغيير خصائصة لصنع تجارب مختلفة متفاوته بصعوبتها وبقوانينها.. أو حتى تغيير المنظور.

I am a die hard fan of the franchise and have put many hundreds of hours into JA2 1.13 (yeah my Steam profile says 27 hours but I owned the game before i got the Steam version, also the Steam version was broken for like a year). I have just finished my first playthrough of the game and I can say without hesitation that this game finally takes the spot as a true successor to JA2.

It's not without it's problems, I have a laundry list of quality of life wishes and I know a lot of people are annoyed at the simplification of the mechanics and the smaller maps but as a fan of both the old and new X-com series, I get why. Also once you get to know many of the mechanics, I find you can still do a lot of tactical things with them.

All in all the writing is action movie cheese and superb, every merc has a fantastic personality and their interactions with each other were always great to listen to. The story was great and the variety of side quests really added to the feeling that you're striving to improve things in Gran Chein. Oh! And the soundtrack is wonderful!

I'm definitely going to come back for more playthroughs, and I hope through modding and further development I'll be able to tailor my next playthoughs exactly to my liking (ala games like Kenshi)

My wishlist:

 - Sector stash inventory filtering/ordering/automatic stacking
 - More reliable stealth kills, a stealth run is only viable if you save scum (Hire Shadow for some real fun knife times though)
 - Fixes to the UI, especially when it bugs out and covers up your aiming menu
 - PAUSE TIME OUTSIDE OF COMBAT! Setting up an ambushes could be so satisfying with more control
 - Bobby Ray, for those of us who like to shop, make it overpriced so it's less useful in the early game, or maybe give us a hard mission to take control of an airfield for deliveries mid game (I had over $1.3 million by the end of my playthrough and I had most of the Elite mercs on the payroll!)
 - *Slightly spoilery* give us a better idea of what triggers a certain plot twist in the game, or fix the trigger (it felt way too early for me) so I can finish off the quests that are locked away after that stage in the story.
 - A better way to transport mercs? Vehicles or something. It's a bit of a pain when different squads move at different speeds
  - Customising mercs, as flawed as Back in Action was, I utterly loved dressing up my soldiers in matching uniforms :D

I do hope a number of these are addressed in up coming QoL patches or from the modding community.

For now, I still say this is a must buy for fans of the franchise or fans of the genre!

Game play is tight and rewarding, and the puzzle box of solving how you 'clear a zone' with your band of unlikely heroes-for-hire. Your liberation efforts aren't just about shooting your way through maps, but will involve some level of light puzzle solving with enough story-beats so as not to make the entire game feel like you're just wandering down a corridor of bad guys to shoot. 

With that said, I do think there are a few caveats that prevent me from recommending this to anyone who's looking for the next tactical game. I do think the good far outweighs the bad, but I'll confess that I have my nostalgia goggles on from playing JA1 and 2 as a teenager colouring my perception; and for someone who's coming in fresh, you may find some of these things intolerable. 

1.) The game could benefit from more thorough bug fixes. 
There are little annoying bugs I have found that have really marred my own experience. One was loading my game to learn I had failed a quest that I had completed successfully (the log itself reflected having completed it, and then later failing it). I wound up replaying a good chunk of the game (probably a good 10-15 hours back), only to hit the same problem. I replayed from a slightly later save for another 5-6 hours only to be hit with the same bug. 

It's pretty frustrating to have lost that many hours of game play and while I'm sure the dev's will get this sorted eventually; I could see someone with less patience uninstalling on the spot after losing 35'ish hours of game play. 

I've also encountered other bugs where NPC's don't seem to recognise quests being completed, or talking to you like you made a major decision when you hadn't, or my character getting unlimited melee attacks, etc... 

2.) UI issues
One of the achievements in this game is to essentially run on iron man mode (game auto-saves, your decisions/ mistakes are final). With the UI in the current state; I think trying to do this in such a mode would be an act of teeth pulling frustration. At time of writing, I have over 100 hours in this game and I STILL can't tell you why my stealthy knife character sometimes just wanders over to a bad-dude and decides to stand in front of them rather than stabbing them. I think I've got it down to an 80% success rate, but most of my loads are just because the UX meant I had a character standing in the middle of nowhere, or somehow putting my overwatch cone in the wrong direction, or missing the pixel that I needed to click on for my grenade to catch all the bad guys, or running to close a door that I couldn't see because of how the walls rendered. 

It's not really an issue if saving/ loading is seamless (and to JA3's credit, it seems well optimised); but again I could see this being one of those 'F-this, I'm uninstalling' moments, especially if you were trying for an ironman run.

3.) Odd choice of when to use the highest stat vs. when not to? 
Sometimes the game knows to put your best foot forward (for instance, when talking to someone; the dialogue doesn't care who clicked on the NPC, and will instead just slot in whomever is the most appropriate for the choices you make). This is good, and smooths out the process of deciding who clicks on a person, and makes everyone feel a little more interactive as they throw in their opinions.

Inversely however, you need to have the right merc selected when you want to pick a lock, disarm a trap, or detect a problem. If you accidentally send the wrong merc into the building who lacks the necessary explosive/ mechanical skill, you'll probably get a few wounds from clicking the wrong box with the wrong person. It doesn't help that the icon for 'DisARM' and 'DisABLE' are identical, so if you miss that bit of text, maybe your explosive expert gets zapped, or your mechanic gets a bomb in their face. 

This isn't an impossible problem to solve, but it feels like unnecessary busywork. Maybe you're the person who delights in picking up on those context clues for the 700th time, and knowing when to send your mechanic vs. your explosives expert in; but for my own sanity I just re rolled my main character to be good at wisdom, explosives and mechanics and then had them be the only one to run around each map trying to uncover collectables. 

This problem is somewhat heightened in that when you have your entire group selected; the game just picks whomever it wants when deciding how to interact with the puzzle. Did you run the group together because that way you could easily put things away in people's inventories? Well then you get to play roulette when deciding who's opening that trapped box. Again; you could just make sure you've got the right person selected at all times but again; these just feel like silly 'gotchas' that make the experience more toxic. 

And before I get any hate for it; I am fully aware that this was part of the original JA series. It was one of the reasons that Trevor was such an important mercenary to recruit (since he had both mechanics and explosives); but he's not here so shush! This is a new generation and I couldn't whinge about this to an audience that cared when I was 13 years old. 

4.) Inventory management could be better? 
This gripe is minor compared to the items above, but I'd have preferred a different inventory management system? I actually like the relationship between strength and slots (it's a nice reward for developing strength, and its way simpler than trying to figure out how much a rocket launcher weighs vs. a machine gun, etc...); but what I dislike is how many items don't go into the squad inventory. 

I think all quest items (such as books, or scraps of paper) could go into the off inventory. I think certain ammo could actually reside with the individual mercenary who needs it, but maybe not in a primary inventory slot. I think little pouches of diamonds could be a squad inventory item, etc... They're aesthetic decisions which I recognise not everyone will agree with; but it was a little annoying to lose an inventory slot to a quest item that I just dragged around a map with me. 

With all that said, JA3 is a genuinely great game. Jagged Alliance was one of the most formative games I had when I was growing up, and it was such a thrill to see the old squad again. I think they did an incredible job giving your mercenaries some really awesome flavour (huge kudos to the decision to give every mercenary something unique and flavorful about them), and I'm already thinking about what my next playthrough is going to look like. With a little time to iron out the UI issues and bugs, I think this could easily be my game of 2023 and I'll be first in line to buy a DLC if we need to go liberate yet another country.",1690933538,1691104776,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't like xcom and that every single TBS turned into xcom clone, while I keep remembering how great JA2 was with its freedom, gun porn, wide areas and great shooting impact. Yeah, the only thing you might find here is maybe gun porn, but otherwise its the same xcom routine  all over again. It does try to make arenas wider, which is one of my main critic points to xcom, but it does not really succeed, maybe because enemies aren't coming to you when hear gunshots and don't really care about any distance, quickly rushing uprfront. 

The worst part, though, is GUI. You can't really tell how much action points what action is going to take, half of the time something is blocking your shooting path and you are completely clueless what it even was. The hit chances are removed or at least I can't really see them, perhaps because in original JA2 they were also hidden, but this is xcom mechanics, you kinda need to know your chances of hitting and killing (oh yeah, enemy health is also hidden). Enemy death animation hardly gives any satisfaction compared to JA2 and what's the most offensive thing to me, is when you shoot and bullet misses but you deal damage (i.e. shooting from outside of combat on moving enemy).

While J.A 2 won't be going anywhere, J.A.3 is a very strong sequel to a game that so many of my gaming peers enjoyed. 

This game has a lot of the heart of the previous- the same sort of cheeky humour with plenty of pop-culture nods, banter between the mercs and the world they inhabit, and a (at this stage) simple story which hooks you enough to dive in and see what the world has to offer that gently guides without overly stymieing player agency. 

The game does have its drawbacks. For example mechanically the game doesn't feel as deep (a lot of information missing around risk-reward for aiming v. percentage gained as an example thereof) , and income purely throttling merc vailability and number rather than being a resource to be spent not only on personnel but weaponry, ammunition and upgrades (seemingly mostly eliminated by the crafting systems) does leave me a little bit wanting. As for something I would have liked to have seen added that hasn't been - more paper-dolling in regards to armour on the tactical screen to easilly identify what merc has what. This however is purely personal and the late game may have some surprises for me that may change my opinion later. 

Overall for those new to the series, or for those of you who like me have spent a long, long time fighting in Arulco, this game is a worthwhile  and well priced purchase and hits many of the key notes for challenge, overall gameplay, and fun factor that a lot of other games on the market seem to ignore.",1691052902,1691052902,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's the mercenary's inventory management. Perhaps due to considering console porting, ammunition is managed on a squad basis rather than individual mercenaries. However, this has made ammunition management incredibly cumbersome.

For instance, Squad 1 uses AK rifles and .44 caliber firearms, while Squad 2 uses AR15s and shotguns. Now, assuming both squads use 9mm firearms, you might think that 9mm can be shared and individual bullets can just be divided. However, each caliber has various types like AP or match rounds, so these need to be distributed to each squad individually. If personnel transfers occur between squads, this gets even more mixed up.

While squads manage the ammunition, individuals use it. Thus, originally having individuals carry their own ammunition would eliminate confusion and be much more intuitive. However, the developers probably won't consider changing this to the old method. Managing ammunition on an individual basis could be even more troublesome on consoles. It's a problem that needs to be addressed through mods.

Despite only mentioning drawbacks, aside from that, it's the ultimate tactical RPG game. I haven't stayed up all night playing a game for nearly a decade. I enjoyed the second installment in my childhood, and I'm grateful to the developers who brought back those memories.

여러 단점들에 대해 언급은 많은데.. 편의성 면에서 정말 치명적인 단점이 존재한다. 바로 용병의 인벤토리 관리다. 콘솔 이식을 고려해서인지 탄약을 용병 개인이 아닌 분대단위로 관리하도록 해 놨는데, 이게 탄약관리를 엄청나게 피곤하게 만들었다.

예를 들어, 1분대는 AK소총, 44구경 총기를 사용하고, 2분대는 AR15와 샷건을 사용한다, 그런데 9mm총기는 둘 다 쓴다 라고 가정하면, 9mm는 둘 다 쓰고, 개별 총알은 그냥 나누면 된다고 생각할 수 있을 것이다. 그런데 각 구경의 탄약마다 AP니 매치탄이니 종류가 다양하기 때문에 이걸 일일이 분대에 나눠줘야 한다. 만약에 분대 간에 인원 이동이 발생하면 이게 또 섞여버린다.

탄약은 분대가 관리하지만 사용은 개인이 하니, 애초에 개인이 탄약을 소지하는 걸로 하면 뒤섞일 일도 없고 훨씬 직관적이다. 그러나 아마 개발사는 이걸 옛날 방식으로 고칠 생각이 없을 것이다. 개인 단위로 탄약을 관리하려면 콘솔에서는 더 피곤한 일이 될 수 있으니까. mod로 해결해야 할 문제다.

단점만 언급했는데, 그거 빼면 궁극의 전술 RPG 게임이다. 게임에 미쳐서 밤 새운것은 거의 10여년만의 일이다. 어린시절 2편을 즐겨했는데 그 추억을 되살려준 제작진에 감사를 표한다",1689403229,1691052333,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Finally a JA game that has been done well and not one of the many failed 'clones' that have come and gone.

* The weapon and sounds are good

* The removal of HIT CHANCE and just using logic (weapon range, mercs stats) is a refreshing and nostalgic change.
* Weapon modding is actually really cool.

But of course it isnt Perfect, nothing ever is but i do think some glaring issues are no ammo/gunstore like in JA2, The training of militia certainly feels diminished compared to the original and things like Mines running out of resources is just silly. The lack/limited amount of customisation for IMP is also a let down but eventually there may be something decent in the workshop.

The game does try to explain everything, but doing so it somehow managed to distract me from a crucial button: going into stealth mode. (I'll admit I assumed crouching would do the trick. It doesn't.) However, once I figured out the what and how I was quickly hooked. It is easy to start a fight, but the AI sells its goons dearly and a more stealthy approach is the smart way to go. It isn't commandos and yet for the first time in many, many years I have the same giddy tactical joy I had whilst playing commandos.

Update: Finished the game twice on its hardest settings. The game is just that much fun. The various interactions between mercs are - imho - good fun, although some people might find them cheap or offensive in some ways. Keep in mind this game aims to comment on various stereotypes found both in reality and in movies and/or games. 

Perhaps my one gripe with the game as is, patches are in active development at this time, is a certain lack of difficulty.

Jagged Alliance 3 is something different. It's not JA2 1.13. I would'e been disappointed if it was JA2-1.13-with-better-graphics. No, JA3 is a reimagining and modernization of JA2. With love and passion, the developers have honed, extracted, and transformed the core of JA2 into something that evolves the franchise. 

I'm loving the mercs, the new game mechanics (especially stealth, MGs, and melee), the vastly improved writing + questing, and most of all: the fun and addiction in this iteration. It's not perfect and there are bugs to fix, mechanics to balance, and tonally, some mercs are way off from JA2 (like Grunty and Dr. Q). But there's still nothing like JA 3 on the market.

I am ecstatic to have another Jagged Alliance variant to play. I'll still play JA1, JA: DG, JA2, and now Jagged Alliance 3. Each are different, but each add something different to the same universe.

most annoying that the trader tables shows you a different ammunition to buy than what you will get..(poacher camp C5 for example) or imp char being irreversible fatigued and can not fuggin move anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.. not even after 2 weeks of resting!!!
if you are to dumb to put in the same buttons like ""search"" or ""use"" as in jagged alliance 2, make at least sure that it is possible to click the traps to disarm them!
weapon choice is poor. 
most time of my playthrough was wasted in scapping bullshit or waiting for the poor tiny little market to refill so i can get some more grenades or ammo.
talking of ammo.. it is ludicrous that there is only 2 places which only sell 7,62 hp and ap in the whole game.
because all in all its just a crappy bugged game with little to none replayability,  only consiting in grinding the same forces armed with the same weapons all the time
oh i forgot.. the AI is dumb as fugg.
the wayfinding also is poop.
somehow even jagged alliance rage had dept. but it is totally missing here..
i am 99% sure that my first playthrough was my last one.
the 1% is just if i get to much bored after my ~400th playthrough of jagged alliance 2 v1.13 or the other jagged alliance parts which you insulted in your trailer

Speaking for myself; It's the worthy JA2-successor I've been waiting for. Let me tell you why.

The little bit of bad -- It's not a perfect game. Here my main flaws why it's a 9/10 and not a 10/10:
- Bobby Ray's shop is missing, as well as transport methods (vehicles etc.) . (Devs confirm this is due to tight delivery deadline).
- IMP merc creation is too basic.
- Crafting, turning weapons into scrap and building items from scrap, is a little basic.
- Some travel pathfinding issues.
- UI at times clunky or unclear, tactical view as command strategy view
- Some other minor bugs or flaws.

However, I understand the process of game development and deadlines. These are things I can absolutely live with, and though important aspects, not significant enough to not enjoy this entire incredible game that is in front of me. I have deep respect for the entire team to be able to build this JA3 in a new engine and finish the near polished product as it is. Fantastic.

The plenty of good -- What I find SO good in JA3:
- Most important: Without doubt, for me, JA3 DOES have this classic youth sentiment FEEL to it.
- Modernized, and is up to modern standards.
- Day/night time and weather conditions; battles really feel different.
- Weapon modding, the sounds of weapons, close to little junk loot, I love this.
- Destroyable environment. Just finding out now about the 'free aim' option, first shooting with my shotgun through the wall at an enemy inside a wooden shack. Once opened up, pistol dual wielders run-n-gun (perk system) and finish off the kill.
- I emotionally connect very well with most characters, the playable ones as well as the NPCs.

All in all a fantastic game, and imo to strategy, tactics and turn-based lovers, a 100% MUST BUY.

My 1st playthrough lasted 85,5 hours, and I enjoyed as good as every second of it.

Once again, thanks Haemimont and THQ for creating this masterpiece!

TLDR: Game is good. Streamlined, yet combat is not that faithful to JA2, but who cares.

I'm always perplexed when it comes to how to start these reviews, which is probably why I never really make em, but given I want this game to be a success so the developers will choose to support this game in the future I have to add my voice and say what I think. And to also let people know this is a great game! there you have it, don't have to read anything more. 

A little about me; I'm a boomer man child who has played a lot of RPGs and turn based tactics games from the mid to late 90's. So it's no surprise that one of my favorite games of all time is Jagged Alliance 2 for the depth and character it brings. But how does this game stack up? 

It's impossible to satisfy everyone, but I'd say as a turn based tactics game they made a great one. Does it feel Jagged Alliance? In spirit yes, probably not combat mechanics wise, but in tone and overworld mechanics there is no mistaking it. It oozes personality and it's a long grinding experience where you are trying to balance tons of small factors like your money and improving your mercs and trying not to run out of ammo. 

When it comes to the premise and set up of the game I'm not going to go into that because it would just make this review longer than it already is going to be, you can just read the description of the game and you'd get the gist, I'm just briefly going to go into the game mechanics and atmosphere of the game and point out what I like and dislike. 

Atsmosphere: I've heard a few reviewers complain that this game doesn't feel like a modern game in terms of cultural norms and sensitivity of today (think of that notion what you will) but I just love that the game actually feels like it takes place the year 2001, and that some of these mercs are relics of another ""simpler"" time. They are all stereo types and caricatures in some way, like they should be and not offensively so if you ask me, some might find it trite though. Regardless the humor definitely fits the setting. The browser feels old and clunky, which is great, I just wish for a bit of hidden interaction there (if there is I haven't found it). When it comes to country of Grand Chien it's well realized and you feel the plight of the divided nation. It's landscapes are varied and fun to play in. I think the only type missing would obviously be a tundra like winterscape, but other than that, you'll find types of biomes to play in.  

Mercs: I have given this it's own section, because it's an important feature of JA, if not the most important. You'll find around 40 or so mercs in the game. Some of the classics are missing (Danny, Lynx, Buzz, Trevor) to mention some personal favorites. Also the M.E.R.C. site is not available, which was a secondary marketplace for low quality/cheap but hilarious Mercs, so that made me a bit sad. But I hope it will be added in the future, like the service could become available after helping a certain lost Merc I won't mention for spoiler reasons. Regardless all the mercs that are in the game are faithful adaption, mostly (Scully has for some reason become Steve Irwin). The Mercs comment on each other, the campaign and the groups actions and you need to keep their moral in order. I feel like all this is done faithfully and excellently. One small complaints they could easily fix with DLC is that certain roles seems to be limited. There aren't a lot of fullblown dedicated doctors in the game or characters with high leadership. There at max 2 options that you can afford to recruit in the beginning, which limits replayability.  

Overworld gameplay: If you don't know the game is divided up between a strategic over world layer and an exploration/combat layer, similar to what you find an X-Com game. The over world section is good, it is simplified and easier to understand than Jagged Alliance 2, streamlined some would say, others would say dumbed down, I'd say both are correct. The thing about JA2, you could do more but the overlay all though not complicated was daunting and unintuitive at first glance. Haemimont have addressed this and stayed relatively faithful in this regard. You conquer mines to stay afloat with your budget, while building up local militia and inching your way towards whatever goal the game sets for you, what this game does really well is give you multiple objectives and freedom of choice in regards to what order you do things in. However certain features are gone like mercs self practicing when they have nothing to do. Also for whatever reason you can only have one single training operation going per sector. So if you want more you have to split your group up and move them into another sector which is generally not worth it. People have also complained about how unrealistic the shared inventory system is, but I grew to like it, they would simply have to rework it entirely with the current limited personal space to fix it, and also this is a place where I personally prefer convenience over realism. There is more I could write here, but I'm already going way too long, the last thing I'll say is that I hope they add vehicles in the future other than boats. 

Exploration and combat layer:  This is probably the section of most contention. Some JA fans think it's just become X-Com and I can see where they are coming from. Combat has become very mechanical, with overwatch being a mode rather than a reaction. Yet people coming from X-Com hate the fact that there is no chance to hit indicator. When it comes to chance to hit, you learn to know when something is more or less a sure thing and you won't have the same frustration when you miss a 95% chance to hit shot, so it was never really an issue for me. Anyway I feel like this is a good overall take on a turn based x-com game. Setting up machine guns is very satisfying (though I read this is getting nerfed now, understandable they are very good) and stealth is excellently implemented. Some might say you can abuse stealth, but i'd argue if you're that good at the game then you deserve to be able to abuse it. Regardless, stealth kills are satisfying. 

My main complaints with combat. 

Rocket and grenade launcher enemies: These dudes are the most unrealistic enemies I've ever seen in a game that purports to be a military tactics game. The rocket launchers are more like sniper rifles that shoots rockets. In reality they should aim for the structure in front of you or the wall behind you, not literally try to hit you in the solar plexus with the rocket, which they actually hit with remarkable accuracy, and you still get up afterwards with 2 wounds. It just takes me out of the whole experience. Another bullshit aspect is grenade launcher enemies that spam grenades with 100% accuracy even if they have no arc of fire, since it goes directly through the roof. It's ridiculously stupid and it goes both ways when you use the grenade launcher. 

C-4 and ""placed"" explosives: One of the most underrated fun things in JA2 was pre planning and placing explosives, you'd feel so smart pulling it off. It's not really a thing in this game, since explosives are treated more like heavy grenades by you and you enemies. You can't prime them and place them on the ground, no you have to throw the explosives and alert all enemies in the vicinity, it's lazy and stupid and I hope it gets looked at. 

Those are my major complaints, so to reiterate; Even if the combat isn't a new take on JA2's turn based combat but more their take on modern X-Com combat, I almost want to say the combat is better than those X-Com games and more satisfying. Guns sound and feel great, there are a lot of of them, hopefully there will be even more, Forgot to talk about weapons modding, it's fun, I don't care how unrealistic it is, but now i'm running out of characters, bye! thx for reading this pile of words.",1690980926,1690981218,True,35,2,0.696036100387573242,0,True,False,False

Jagged Alliance 3 is just that. It nails the tone, gameplay, and pretty much the soul of JA2. Not only that, it improves on weather systems giving different gameplay bonuses and debuffs, or making stealth more of a viable option in combat and more.

The pervasive feeling of playing a game based upon a 1990s action movie. The wide variety of guns and gear and the additional modifications which can be added to them. The thoughtful level design which often allows clever approaches to combat situations.

The story design which forces a variety of moral choices, and which provides numerous opportunities to think outside the box when solving quests.

Bad: Though the story is interesting overall, there are a couple predictable turns in the plot. A few of the mercs and NPCs nail their 90s stereotypes hard enough that it could occasionally be considered offensive by some.

Also for context, I also loved the original Jagged Alliance, but somehow never played the 2nd installment

I would say the main difference between XCOM and JA3 is that the developers really wanted to go with the open-world concept, with the idea of go where you want, do what you want, build the team you want and battle with whatever play style you enjoy the most.  It took me a while to get my mind around that, but once I did, I really started enjoying the game even more.  Another big difference is that XCOM has the ultimate challenge and best enjoyed in Ironman mode, whereas I would say JA3 is almost the exact opposite and so far has been best enjoyed in Save-Scum Mode.

The other thing is the pre-battle real-time format is really weird and takes a while to get used to.  One tip is that if you're planning on stealth kills with your snipers, then once you are all set-up and you move into sniper zoom mode, then the game automatically moves into slow-mo which allows you to take the shot at the precise time you feel would be optimal to get the kill without alerting nearby guards who might otherwise see or hear the body crumble.  That's pretty sweet.  However I wish there was a similar mechanic for stealth melee kills with your knife assassins.  Setting up these type of kills is much harder because the game is in real-time mode and never goes into slow-mo, so sneaking up behind your target can be challenging since that guard may look your way at any given moment - no auto slow-mo as you approach for a kill, which would have been super cool.  (NOTE TO DEVELOPERS - please add in throat-slit and/or takedown animations for successful melee stealth kills, if feels great to pull it off successfully, but all that work should be rewarded all the more!)  The real-time transition to turn-based tactics is what partly explains my earlier comment about Save-Scumming and why the game mechanics don't really lend itself towards Ironman-style play modes.

The in-game banter between the mercs is hilarious.  My favorite is Livewire.  She's seriously hilarious.  Her scoundrel perk is also super helpful.  Fox's chatter is actually a little annoying but her ""release the nudes"" line upon death had me rolling!!
  
So in summary, I would say the more you play this game and realize the nuances in all the weapons, the modifications, what can be achieved in battle (pre-battle formations, Stance options, aiming for different body parts, the ambushes you can set-up, long, medium vs short-range combat etc), the more brilliant this game feels.  Only 70 hours in and thoroughly enjoying it.  I'm quite sure that 100+ hours in, I'll be even enjoying the detailed  mechanics all the more.

Just tried to chill, like in old JA2. First I started on Commando, but quickly changed it to First blood. Amount of reloading of saved games gone higher and higher. After clearing half of the map, the Refuge camp mision appeared. Multiple tries to clear Refuge camp mission, but than defending everything else is just undoable. I have 6 mercs, they got 20. I shoot with 8 damage, they shoot with 50 damage with my full body armour from granies. It took me 4 hours of constant reloading, and searching for any way how it could be done, but no, its impoible. I gave up. Game is too hard on first blood difficulty. 
Ja2 gets easier and easier, in Ja3 difficulty just spikes like crazy for no reason at all. You just chilling with sniper rifles killing bandints, and than suddenly got killed by army. Well I gues that the story, sad story where bad guys won. Ragequit.

Otherwise nice game.

32 hours
Edit: After that, just put on Trainer with ton of cheats, and game is playable again

In game you have an options to kill swarms of enemies to solve the issue, but that requers explosives and ammo, which are almost none in game. 
The only way to obtain enough ammo and explosives is having a 1 cheap merk in each sector where the the trader table is, and buy from it every 24 hours. It is just ridiculous compared to Bobby Rays guns in JA2. 

So if you want to win JA3 without cheats: 
Control mines and weapon traders tables! Not cities!
Make a paper note where every table is with which items, because none are shown on the map. 
Dont do quests. 
Hire at least 18 merks and manage them as it is nightmare
Use silent snipers when you attacking. 
Use exposives and machineguns when you are defending. 

Absolutely ridiculous and not what you expecting playing the game. Using Exploits to win the game.

Ok, invasion was the most interesting event of the game :) Should have known that 4 guys with machine guns could have stopped the invasion. But how could you know ? How could you know if it is a last wave? How could you know how many ammunition to expend?

You have a party (than can grow and split into multiple parties) of mercenaries exploring an Africa-themed open world and fighting turn-based battles. As you fight your way toward the final boss's fortress, you uncover conspiracies, suffer betrayals, gain and lose ground, modify your guns, and solve sometimes surprisingly difficult and open-ended quests.

Between the dozens of mercs, tough quests, and other challenges, JA3 offers a great deal of replayability. Even a semi-thorough play-through takes 40 hours. This is a large game.

Both the game's world and the mercenaries ooze personality and detail. The metagame simulating a civil war works well and offers a real-time strategic gameplay layer on top of the turn-based tactics.

Though it has no major weaknesses, JA3 could have been better in some of its aspects. The graphics are solid but not great. The AI is dumb and giddily runs piecemeal into the player's killing fields.

Overall, JA3 is a pleasant surprise and one of the better TBS games I have played in a while. For comparison, I liked JA3 much better than Wasteland 3.

It's a loyal tribute to its predecessors and is a challenging but fair experience. I've been following the development of this game for a couple years now and I'm pleasantly surprised with how it turned out. 

Some notes, thoughts, comments on the game, in no particular order:
-On the easiest difficulty, the only .50 cal weapon I found was the Desert Eagle
-The funniest thing that happened during my play through was watching an enemy rocketman blow himself up by shooting inside a building
-Some mercenaries are more entertaining than others and this is primarily what I based my hiring practices on
-I never met Biff but I expect that conversation to be hilarious
-Smart move to set the game in 2001
-Chasing down a lone enemy on a map can slow down the pace of the game but- the maps are always a manageable size. So it's usually not bad if you have enough merc to search.
-Many hilarious and unexpected pop culture references sprinkled throughout
-The modding community came through on day one, with the visible percentage to hit mod
-Once you get over the learning curve, you're gonna have a great time
-Do the create-your-own merc thing EARLY. As soon as you can. They have a fixed cost so they save you money in the long run. And mixing a Lvl. 1 Merc into your starting group is much easier than trying to mix them into a more experienced group. Ex: My first IMP merc died in a auto-resolve battle while everyone else sustained minor injuries. Once they're gone they're gone unless you mod. 
-Some slick references to JA1+2 sprinkled throughout
-Really awesome to see so much love and support for a game that's essentially a remake of a 30-year old series. JA2 is a lot of fun and they've managed to capture than and expand on it in JA3.

I'm going to take a break from this game for a little while and soak it in before taking another shot at in on a a harder difficulty. I see it becoming one of my most-played games in time.",1690860532,1690860532,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Is it worth your time? Yes.

I did not think i would live to see the day. Finally, a worthy successor to Jagged Alliance 2. While i miss some of the micromanagement like spending AP to change the direction your mercs are looking, this game still manages to capture the feeling of JA2, both in general style and gameplay.

To the people comparing it to a heavily modded JA2, you're comparing apples and oranges. You don't even remeber vanilla JA2. What you're playing right now is vanilla JA3. Have some patience, let the developer create patches, let the community create mods. Then make your judgement.

However i have to be honest about some of the lack of depth that is unlikely to be restored even with purely speculative DLC. No camo, no extended ear, less weapons, less things to do in the management map. Overall some streamlining happened.

There is still room for different builds, the mercs have unique and valuable traits, weapon customization is deeper and a talent tree was added. Quests and loyalty of the liberated settlements are still a thing. You can make some impactful choices in those quests.

The difficulty is as you would expect it. In the beginning, you better avoid patrols and let your trained militia defend the sectors on their own. Later on you can choose to become an unstoppable sniper god if you collect the right gear and talents. Which is something i enjoy in RPGs. (Looking at you, Oblivion level-scaling)

Hardcore JA2 fans may not be satisfied with some of the new mechanics and ways the developers handled certain things but the important thing is that after 20 years, a studio finally got the spirit and ""feel"" of Jagged Alliance right in a proper sequel.  There are many quality of life improvements that modders are already adding for people to tweak settings as they see fit.  Eventually I think there will be total overhauls of combat system settings for people who want to play a more realistic simulator style like the 1.13 JA2 mod.  

Very pleased with the game though it is by no means perfect, it is very, very good.  Difficulty can vary wildly when you first learn the mechanics and the progression of the map.  New players could be wiped out if they rush in without knowing how to use stealth and other mechanics.  On the other hand it becomes too easy once you know how to take advantage of over powered weapons and tricks.  It is not really possible to balance this kind of game for every play style so it comes down to using ""house rules"" for your own play through.  Custom Settings mod allows increased number of enemies and I think mods will continue to improve the ability to tailor it to your play style.

It's certainly a simplified game when compared to JA1 or 2, but it doesn't go so far down the other end where it becomes an utter, casualized mess. There's a surprising ammount of content in the game - specally for the low price tag that comes with it, and there's a simple joy in picking up different mercs and seeing how you can specialize or combine them. If you're a hardcore fan of the previous JA titles, you can absolutely complain ad nauseum about some of the aforementioned simplifications, but at the end of the day, this is still a very fun game with some solid, chunky mechanics to bite down on. I really just wish the AI wasn't quite as bad at times, and that there was a fast-forward button for some very slow turns.

Didn't think the games-industry is still capable of making these kind of games. Totally didn't expect anything like this to happen.
And it is true to the Jagged Alliance franchise.


Finally a game that is not a cheap attempt at doing something with the franchise that eventually fails. So many Jagged Alliance games after JA2 that were just bad in so many ways, with maybe one exception.


This JA3 has the spirit and vibe of the old one, with a more modern look, yet familiar. Dialogue choices along the way offer interesting story elements and the turn based combat is solid.


It is semi-open worldish. Meaning, theoretically you can do anything in any order. There are different outcomes and they are being recognized by the game depending on the order of things.

Basically you can rescue the president first, then liberate the villages.
Or ignore everyone, just go for the diamond mines to get income.

Same with high pressure timed events. The game allows you to completely ignore them (the dude dies,obviously) and the game acknowledges your decision without any kind of ""game over"".

It's really cool, as it means you can play the way you want. Be the good guy, trying to rescue and help everyone.

Or just a money focused Merc contractor, who does't really care for innocent people. Just here for the $$$.


You can theoretically even kill most quest NPCs, and for some of them the devs even acknowledge that it happened.
Example: You elimiate the rebellion leader instead of helping him, and the villagers will react to that, as well as the whole faction, should you encounter their soldiers, will attack you on sight.


The amount of work that has been put into these little details is pretty ridiculous. Some devs really nerded out on that.

And that's not even taking into account the many different merc personalities and how they weigh in to give their comments on stuff. 

Reminds me of Bioware's Dragon Age ""light"". Sure, it's not a real RPG, but it definitely has these Bioware moments, where decisions matter.
And you even have these Bioware like moments where you can find characters in the world that will join your group, if you behaved in a way that made them like you. 
Otherwise they might just be an enemy.

Game is full of little details, quite astonishing what they pulled of with a team size the fraction of what Bioware and EA teams have.

Stealth shots to the head, and stealth knifes to the neck should always be instant kills from out of combat. While in combat, I understand why it would be OP, but out of combat it's just stupid I can sneak up on a guy and slit his throat, or blow his head off and he just doesn't die, starts squealing, and starts combat. Annoying.

You should not lose weapon durability when modding the weapon. This is just stupid and feels like it was only put in the game to waste my time. I can't imagine anyone doesn't just load when a mod fails and just breaks their weapon. I'm fine with a mod failing and consuming the materials, but damaging the gun is just stupid.

At the start the game seems excellent. Almost a honest replica of JA2, with improved graphics.

Played a day or so, got my first diamond mine, trained some militia, overtook diamond shipment, etc. 

But as soon as you get to larger fights, especially with reinforcements, the issues start to pile up with the tactical UI. 

C'mon, it's a game about fighting. And fights mostly happen in tactical UI. So we're talking one of the most important parts of the game.

And tactical UI makes me think about returning the game. Oh, in small fights it works OK. 

But as soon as you hit something bigger, its deficiencies start to break the game. Consider:

- NO PAUSE. That's right, you have real-time part before combat starts, but no PAUSE. You may think it adds realism, but when you load quicksave for the 4th time, because you couldn't order your mercs to go hiding fast enough in real-time to make an ambush... well, it's a game ffs. If you wanted realism, how about people movements taking actual minutes instead of the seconds they do in a game.

- NO PATH SHOWN. That's right, you can order merc to go somewhere, but you can't see which path he will take. If you want him to take the correct one, you just save and hope you won't have to load.

- NO PATH WAYPOINTS. Yeah, that goes hand in hand with no path shown. You can only order a merc 2 movements per turn, regardless how short.  And that goes hand in hand with the UI clunky thing that if you plan the first move, it will show you whom can merc see at the point where you click. But if you click somewhere ELSE afterwards, the merc will interpret it as the 2nd move, instead of you trying to see whether the 2nd place is better for the first move. So it will do the 2 moves and will have merc without 0AP.

- Very slow enemy/ally turns. If you have like 8 enemies and 8 more coming as reinforcements, plus some militia defending the place... the fight can go on for hours 70% of which you will be simply seeing what the other forces are doing. No option to speed that up. Point in case is Port Cacao, where you arrive in sector and there are local defenders, 8 enemies, and you know there will be reinforcements.

All in all, would've been a good replica of JA2, if tactical UI would have been decent.

The gameplay is a little different, with the stealth kills and other new/modern mechanics, but the core of the game still feels right. Managing the mine income, merc contracts and side quests feels very inspired from the original JA/JA2 series.

The things that have been a long time part of the series feel updated, things like the weapon mods system feel meaningful and impactful to the game. The overwatch system feels more modern than the old random interrupts that it replaces, but still serves the same purposes. Many different ways to approach taking a sector which can satisfy a lot of different playstyles.

The returning mercs are mostly standards, and the new ones fit in well. There's a few surprises in who is returning and who isn't, but I'm wondering if there's a few old cats around just waiting to be found. All the mercs have their own distinct personalities still which is core to the JA series. Custom merc creation is a lot more straightforward but still makes sense, and there is still an option to fill out a personality quiz which is a nice touch for old JA fans. The perks feel like they actually make a difference to the gameplay.

My main detractions would be the sound, music and voice acting, although none of them are outright bad. The sound and music aren't immersive and memorable like JA2 is, but do end up being par for the course. The voice acting, once again, isn't terrible but can definitely feel a little too over the top sometimes. It's nice that the VO isn't underwhelming though, just a few lines that could've been shortened and had better impact IMO. Feels like the voice acting cast really tried to put personality and feeling into the lines, and I'll take a little cheezy over totally flat and boring every day.

One other minor issue, the controls can get a little wonky sometimes aren't always helpful, and with stealth being a main part of the game that can be frustrating. Can be easy to unintentionally move a merc when trying to select something, and can sometimes be hard to interact with objects unless the camera is in a good angle. Probably not a deal breaker for most, but may take some getting used to for stealth kills and setting up during free move.

Overall, really enjoying the vanilla playthrough and I'm excited to see the community and mods grow in the future. If you're a fan of turn based tactical shooters, pick this one up if it's on a solid sale. If you're a longtime fan of the series and have been waiting 20 years for another good entry, this one may finally be it.

It's not as complex as JA2, but it's still a very fine tactical experience, where you can play however you want.

So you can recruit him for yourself, or just shoot him for reward from poachers, or you can convince Flay to let the Poachers be and he leaves forever and you get smaller reward from poachers since you didnt kill him but he is atleast gone. Or my favourite solution, you can recruit him, then bring him to the poachers and kill him intront of them for a good show, which yields the highest reward since the poachers had some fun with him*

And loads of other Quest have similar many different solutions. This is really good entertaining stuff!

I was a bit afraid that this Game is gonna fall Flat on its Ass, considering that every JA since 2 has done that. Out of JA:BIA, Rage and Flashback, BIA was the best, and that is a very sad thing to say, cause BIA was pretty awful all in all. (They ruined Fox! and so much more)

JA 2 will always have a special place in my heart ever since i played the Demo from a PC Player Magazine Demo CD sometime in 1999 (yeah sry im an old fart). I never thought that there will be a worthy successor after all those disappointments but they have actually finally done it....I really think that this is even better than JA 2!

The mayor stuff that i think is a bit lackluster is the amount of weapons, there could be a few more Weapons. Definitely not enough Sniper Rifles, Assault Rifles and Machine Guns (but we might be spoilt from JA 2 1.13 with like 300 Guns and all kinds of variants for each Gun) Although Mods might fix that in the Future probably.  And my biggest disappointment is that they left out quite a few Mercs that i really liked back then. WIth all those Voicelines and so many unique Lines from every Merc depending on what happens and whos on the Team i kinda understand it, its a ton of work. But i really miss Trevor Colby and Rudy ""Lynx-Eyed"" Roberts. Those two together with Scully was my mega Aussie Squad: ""Bugger! Crim's up there. I see 'em!"" :) (i Know Scully is a brit, but he seems very Australian in JA2) 

But they did a good Job with the mercs, pretty much all of them are actually better than they are in JA2 (Voice and looks wise i mean) Grizzly is a lot more likeable compared to his JA 2 appaerance for example. Scully and Fox i still prefer from JA 2 though. I liked Scully's JA 2 voice better and Fox's voice is good in JA 3 (not that ditzy Cheerleader voice she had in BIA thank god) but i dont like her Picture that much, looked Foxier in JA 2 ;)

I hope we will see more of Haemimont and what they can do with Jagged Alliance in the Future. 9/10 from me :)",1690690932,1690740111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You never have enough money to buy what you need, and capturing a diamond mine doesn't bring in enough income to make a difference. You are always outnumbered at least two to one, and that would be OK except the enemies are a better shot than your mercs and they have better weapons, too. You always seem to have to fight, making the dialogues with the characters a waste of time.

One huge oversight is that there is no way to purchase weapons or ammo in the game. How is that possible? You can purchase the mercs anytime but nothing else? It needlessly makes the game less fun.

That's the main problem with the game - it's just not fun, and it's not that it's too hard, although it is at times. It's because you never really get to enjoy the game as you're always stressing about losing a merc or wasting even a small amount of ammo.

Minor cons (most of them easily addressed by mods):

- Ammo being somewhat scarce means that you are limited in your tactics (you can seldomly afford suppresive fire and will almost exclusively use single shots, which, for some reasons, do more damage than individual bullets in bursts...). Also, no actual vendor, just random stalls that allow to you to buy single item a day (and only one vendor that sells one type of ammo).

- No vehicles ouside of loaning boats, no air travel or airspace and fuel management (no ennemy vehicules either).

- No active pause or manully triggered turn based phase in real time ambush mode.

- No stamina system and your characters just get the ""fatigued"" or ""exhausted"" status effect randomly while traveling and worse of all: stun grenades inflict thoses statuses as well, and the only way to get rid of said status effects are to have your mercs wait or actively rest in selected areas...

- Smaller maps and diminished weapon ranges meaning that gunfights usually happens ridiculously close to your enemies who can flank you in a single turn.

- ""Boss"" ennemies are just hp sacks. Not fun to fight.

- Simplified ammo management. All your ammo are in an infinite ""squad pool"" instead of being carried by individual characters, and guns/ammo compatibility have been dumbed down as well (ie, both akm's and ak-74's uses 7.62*39).

Again, all of these are very minor cons for an otherwise phenomenal game.",1690708283,1690708531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is overall great. It continues the style of JA2 almost perfectly while improving to todays standards of graphics, GUI and controls. 
It is actually a sequel to JA2 - lot of same mercenaries and some characters from previous game. Takes place in 2001 :)
The mechanics of cover is great. The overwatch mechanics is enjoyable. 
There are few topics though I find annoying and poor design choice. But in the end - all not that significant. I hope some might be balanced/chaned in some future patches.
1) ammo - not sure why it was decided to not be able to buy ammunition, weapons and weapon addons and instead rely on crafting it. in JA2 it was possible to buy ammo and weapons on internet and have it shipped to Arulco. That seemed perfectly realistic and was reasonably priced. In JA3 it feels more like postapocalyptic setting then, when you have to salvage and craft your ammo. Not a modern day mercenary operation. It really breaks immersion. The same with mercs crafting a laser pointers or thermal scopes from a chip, lense and a number of salvaged parts. 
2) friendly fire - the game (similar to xenonauts) is obsessed with friendly fire. Friendly fire is IMO something, that should happen if you shoot at target, in proximity of your ally. Not if you are shooting on a far away target while you are next to your ally. Here the mercenary will almost 100% hit your guy, if he is standing in fron of him (even prone for example).
3) looting and hacking - seems a counter-intuitive - as you are often looting and hacking in front of eyes of the owners without any impact. 
4) crocodiles - someone had an idea, tha crocodiles would be fun and tough enemies - I understand, that the game overall has hitpoints and even with human enemies, they survive much more, than would be realistic. But the crocodiles are IMO too much - 6 mercs firing everything they got - machine gun, shotgun, sniper rifle to one crocodile, all hitting and the beast still runs to my group and criticaly wounds a merc. This overestimates the resiliance of animals vs weapons. Crocodile is not that big or armored. Although it's probably ignorant to pain.

JA3 is a pretty good successor to JA2, after a very long string of lackluster entries that kept trying to deviate from what everyone liked about the series. It only took two decades for multiple developers to catch on. It has some minor hiccups, but overall feels like the natural evolution of JA2.


For totally new folks, the bigger review:

JA3 is part tactical RPG, part war strategy, and part manager; it's effectively a very soft mil-sim set in a world that never quite moved on from the golden age of 80s action movies.

You, the commander, are contracted to help rescue the president of a tiny African country and quickly find out that a lot more is going on than a simple coup. You're responsible for hiring mercenaries from A.I.M., forming squads from unique characters all with their own specializations, talents, and gear. It's up to you to give turn-by-turn tactical decisions in combat, manage your squad movements against Legion troop maneuvers, keep everyone happy and paid, and save Grand Chien from falling apart entirely, even if you opt to burn half of it down on your path to victory.

The game's mechanics might take a moment to grasp, but they are easier to grasp if you're familiar with Wasteland 2 and/or 3; anyone trying to compare this to the hyper-simplified XCOM deboots is a fool. Stance, cover, weather, gear condition, and more all affect every shot. Weighing risks is a skill you'll hopefully acquire very early on.

The story has multiple branching twists, with decisions both minor and major coming back to reward or bite you in multiple ways. Seeing everything in a single playthrough is impossible due to conflicting goals in several quests. The branching stories and ability to play with a completely different set of unique mercs definitely encourage multiple playthroughs.

The music is pretty solid and includes several remixed golden oldies for JA vets to catch. ""Payday"" in particular is a great returning battle theme.

Some bugs and questionable design decisions (No unified store!) do muck up the experience, though the dedicated modding community has already fixed most of these issues less than a month after release and the devs have promised future updates.",1690646751,1690694484,True,2,0,0.519412398338317871,0,True,False,False

Even though I love Turn based strategy games in a modern, firearm existing setting, I was very skeptical. While I did not enjoy XCOM very much, I did love Wasteland 2 & 3, however, Jagged Alliance was only a name I heard a few times and seen a few clips of older games which were definitely out of my comfort zone in terms of Acceptance of old graphics and controls.
However, thankfully I was incredibly pleasantly surprised. The game offers an amount of freedom of choices I never saw in a game like this. You can go (mostly) at your own pace wherever you want and pick the mercenaries you like the most. Each merc is vastly different (with some bringing game altering skills/equipment with them, like Livewire's PDA, that highlights enemies permanently once a sector has been scouted, or Vicky's permanent lock picking kit). And while they all have perks that would guide them in a specific direction (like Stealth or CQC), you can build them however you like. There are so many quirky and unique mercenaries to choose from that every battle can be completely different. In addition they all have their own unique personality, complete with relationships and dialogues with other mercs and jokes and witty remarks to current situations. (Mouse saying ""I am good at making people ignore me"" stings a little :') )

Not only do you get an incredibly vast array of mercs to choose from and the ability to create your own (that I missed until halfway through my first playthrough), you also have a massive world to explore with every tile on the sat map being a detailed hand crafted place to explore and find little secrets and loot. 
The game is also chock-full of side quests and fully voiced NPCs.
One thing regarding the Soundtrack: It is incredible. It fits so well. At the start of the game, you liberate a village called “Ernie”. Once you kill off the last enemies, the villagers will start to come out of hiding and fill the lovely crafted village with life again, while a very cheerful African song plays. At this time, I had to pause for a moment to appreciate the artistry of this current scene. (The song is called “Magcina”).

And now after finishing the game for the first time (what I rarely do with games nowadays), I am looking forward to begin my Modded playthrough from Hell.
At the time of this Review, the developers have not released the modding tools yet, as the plan to release then in the very near future after release. However even without the official modding tools, that will enable people to create their own Maps, Campaigns, Npcs, Mercs, Guns, Stories and so on, there is already a good amount of very different Mods to choose from, INCLUDING a mod from the developers themselves: Show Hit percentage. While Jagged Alliance 3 does not show you your chance of hitting a target, this can be changed with an official mod (by the devs) for people who want that. Complete with a disclaimer that this is not how this game is supposed to be played. 
All in all, Jagged Alliance 3 is definitely a very welcome Surprise in the current climate of releasing half finished, rushed and buggy games for the maximum amount of money by greedy Corporations. And I sincerely believe that everyone who enjoys Turn based strategy games will love this one.

TL;DR: Xcom is shit. Buy this one.

As for JA2, this game lacks interface simplicity and performance stability. This is good attempt but surely developers rushed time. It is performance unstable and it is pain to use the UI. these factors disract you from JA2 immersion gameplay since you have to reload from crash, reload from freezes due to memory leak or reload because of clunky UI.
This game is dumbed down and has bad intrface so it is similar to JA Back in Action + fun destructable environment from Silent Storm.

The interface is bad bluntly. It stays realtime until the enemy sees you rather than the older games style of realtime till one side sees the other. With other clunkiness on top you'll be walking mercs through known minefields and into the middle of groups of enemies a lot. Ironman isn't an option here. You'll need to reload not due to your fault but due to clunkiness of the ux.

Many of the other aspects of the game are off too. They have the aim webbrowser (of course) but it's missing a lot of content. As in you literally have 404s in the make believe in game browser that aren't meant to be there.

Not nearly as many mercs as the older games but the ones they have all have a lot to say in a lot of situations which is nice. 

It's clunky, not finished and... I'm hooked.

Sometimes a game is so good at its core that all of the above just doesn't matter. I'll reload from a misclick 1000 times to see the next character or sector story arc. I can't help it. There hasn't been anything nearly as good as this since the first 2 Fallout and the first 2 JA games.

At this price point, I'm not expecting XCOM, XCOM2 quality of a game. I love JA3 as much as I love the original JA and J2, but here's hopefully what the devs should improve:

1. There should be a sort button for Sector Stash/Merc Backpack. It's easier to sort your backpack if there's a dedicated button for it rather than having to manually arange each item *FACEPALM*

2. We should be able to buy weapons, ammos, and attachments online like on JA2 Wildfire. Look already have the cash and you have an in game laptop, buying ammos, weapons and attachments should have been a feature!

3. There should be an added layer of alternate transport methods in the map, again like JA2 Wildfire where we can have a Humvee, Ice Cream Truck, heck even a Helicopter. Adds more fun to the game.

4. We shouldn't be able to craft attachments! It just doesn't make sense that you have a lens and some gun parts then suddenly you have a scope. WTH?! It's better if we could just pick those off from enemies. It gives you a thrill if you suddenly find a great attachment!

5. Custom merc portrait! Dammit! Look, we should be able to customize the look of our merc even if it's just on the photo! If not, just give us more portrait on the merc.

1) Balance

The stealth system is completely bonkers. Once you get your hands on a few silenced, scoped rifles, most encounters will become virtually the same - as long as you keep your distance from enemies and can kill them with a single headshot, they'll never be able to detect or fight you.

And when that doesn't work (mostly during quests or scripted encounters), you can always demolish dozens of people per turn by spamming explosives, stockpiled during the many hours of cheesing the AI through stealth. And speaking of quests...

2) Bugs

Quite a few of side missions can be broken if you don't do things in a ""correct"" order, which is rather dumb for a game featuring an open world. 

For instance, there's a quest where you need to break a guy out of prison, but if you go to the said prison first, the game will simply assume that the quest WAS actually taken and won't adjust the dialogue in any way.

It might sound like a nitpick, but when something like this forces you to search for guides or even load a previous save, you know the QA screwed up.

3) UI

The best word to describe the UI would be ""finicky"". And while it's not the worst thing out there, it makes managing two or more squads EXTREMELY time-consuming, as you need to account not only for your mercs' weapons and armor, but also each individual type of ammunition and crafting component they might need.

Some gripes aside, this substantially delivers on the promise of a much beloved game from 1999. I'm no JA2 1.13 fanatic but I have played it a little over the years, so it's possible that some of the hardcore fans won't like this, but I think overall 95% of the people who play JA3 will enjoy it.

I'll start with the gripes. None of them are impossible to patch or mod, I don't think.

- Stealth kill system isn't good. Melee builds don't work well aside from mercs with unique ability (Blood) who can slash his way around the map. This is in contrast to the way stealth kills worked in Miasma Chronicles (and Mutant Year Zero before it).

- Sniper rifles are completely OP due to relatively small maps with lots of open ground and poor/underwhelming SMG and assault rifle damage.

- Also the AI is usually braindead which leads to simple 'run toward the field of carnage snipe zone' gameplay. By lategame I have probably 8 snipers across my 12 main mercs.

- Lack of shops. Unlike in JA2 where we had the beloved Bobby Rays, in JA3 there are few shops (and those that exist have extremely limited selections), so you'll end up with too much money and nothing to spend it on. Ammo can be a problem for this reason which makes certain weapon types more viable than others. And this also reinforces how OP sniper rifles are.

- Fiddly inventory system. There's no autosort at all which is very annoying for a game published in 2023. You'll spend a lot of time scrapping useless weapons for parts, manually making stacks of items and transferring items/ammo from one squad to another.

Okay that's enough with the negatives. Despite the points above, JA3 is absolutely one of the best turn-based squad games published in this or any other year. I have enjoyed a few turn-based games in 2023 but they were mainly games that were much more 'on rails' such as Hard West 2 or Showgunners. Those games have personality and fun gameplay but very little replayability, I would judge. Miasma Chronicles is a little more open but still has a fairly linear progression and limited RPG stuff.

JA3 is MUCH MUCH better as an open-world RPG than any game I can think of in recent times, and that is because of the 30+ unique mercs, all with unique skills and personalities. They have banter with each other and NPCs and I'm sure that picking an entirely different team will lead to a substantially different second playthrough. Just like in JA2 the strength of the game is in these mercs. I think the devs did an outstanding job of recreating the flavour of JA2 mercs and also added a few new mercs that are good fun too.

Just as importantly, the world in JA3 consists of a large map with 150+ sectors, each with unique, crafted locations, NPCs, quests and loot. While the maps are quite small, there's a loving attention to detail in the design of each map. We have a variety of biomes (jungle, desert, forest etc) and the game is genuinely beautiful to look at, in stark contrast to Miasma Chronicles where 90% of the game was in the same grey hellscape. Even the non-important sectors are usually worth visiting for the loot available.

JA3 is certainly a fun game for the gun nuts, because there's a wide range of weapons available and almost all of them can be modified. While there has been some criticism of this system, especially in the way that you can silence virtually any weapon (even a shotgun) I thought it was pretty strong in this regard. Lots of ammo types and some fun throwable weapons like the old frag grenades, mustard gas etc.

The world is vibrant and interactive with lots of interesting quests and memorable NPCs. There are genuinely multiple ways of pursuing quests and you aren't railroaded down a 'good or bad' choice at all. No lukewarm morality system or anything like that except in terms of town loyalty to you, which translates into income. Related to this, the game is CERTAINLY NOT politically correct in many ways. It's a real throwback to the 90s in this regard and will certainly make the anti-SJW brigade happy with its retro politics and attitudes. Thus we have the character of Fox who is basically a loose woman indeed and all kinds of other racial and cultural stereotypes that are rarely seen in games anymore.

And lastly I will say that the game is big, and long. 47 hours in and I think I am in the final phase now, but more careful players will certainly get 70-80 hours out of one playthrough. I am playing on the middle difficulty without ironman conditions and while there have been long periods where the game felt too easy (sniper + headshot x infinity) the scripted fights are often harder and some reloads have been required. I will certainly play a second time with different mercs and maybe a different strategy so there's easily 100 hours of content here. I'm hopeful that there will be improvements to some of the gripes via patches, but there is also a mod community/Steam workshop stuff happening already. I would also like to see more mercs/content added via DLC.

I see no reason at all why JA3 won't become one of the greatest games in the turn-based tactical genre for many years if it isn't that already. This is a gift to oldschool players such as myself, almost like a blast from the past with 2023 graphics.

So far (I'm only a couple hours in), JA3 is the game that I remember JA1/2 to be. Which is pretty much the best possible outcome.

I will say this much…when I saw the title pop up in New Releases, it immediately made me remember old issues of PC Gamer with ads for the original game when I was a kid. It looked cool. I wanted it. Never ended up playing it.

But the memory got my attention. I bought, played, and have been thoroughly enjoying this game.

The first thing I noticed right out the gate is that it reminded me a LOT of Pillars of Eternity 2, the cRPG. Maybe it’s using the same engine…I don’t care enough to look into these things. But everything from the UI to the graphics made it feel a lot more like a cRPG and less like XCOM (which I am familiar with). 

JA3 is a combat-heavy cRPG in my mind -- just about mercenaries, not wizards. I probably feel that way because of the open-world aspect, but the characters, side quests, and stories definitely contribute to that appraisal. 

FIRST IMPRESSIONS --

I thought the opening cutscene was a little cheap…just voiceover on a fairly static 3D-rendered desk. That had me worried about overall quality, but far be it from me to make crazy snap judgements based on something that superficial. Ahem.

I always go into games blind, so I just did what the popup tooltips suggested. Start with three mercs, it said, so I hired three. I pretty much just grabbed three that looked useful…Steroid, Fox, and MD. 

A reminder, because I have no experience with the past games, I did not expect the “humor” part. Somehow, I managed to get into the first combat map still thinking this was going to be a fairly serious military game.

Then the characters started talking. I’ll admit, it turned me off pretty bad at first. These are some really, really heavy-handed jokes delivered by one-dimensional characters. First was Steroid, voiced by a bad Arnold impersonator. Everything he says has something to do with being pumped, flexing, or hoping to find protein powder in a loot crate. Eh. 

But what really killed me was Fox. I guess she’s supposed to be a total sloot, because every one of her lines is thinly-veiled sexual innuendo. I got tired real fast of her saying “sometimes it’s more fun when you have to be quiet” (or something close to that) every time I told her to move while stealthed. Her lines were so bad, I ran to the menu and started over, vowing NOT to hire her again. 

Second go-around, I replaced her with Mouse and was much happier. She hopes to find cheese in loot crates, but it’s less annoying than a merc who sounds like she’s trying to bang the enemy rather than shoot them.

Choosing the right mercs along the way helped a lot with making the experience as enjoyable as it ultimately was. At one point, I hired a guy who ended up being kind of boring, so I just kicked him out of the squad, exiled him to a bottleneck on the map, and relegated him to training militia for the rest of his life. Problem solved.

I did that after realizing I could create ONE custom merc. Not sure why it’s just one, but I’ll take it. 

GAMEPLAY AND DIFFICULTY --

It’s straightforward and fun. I’m pretty sure if you’re familiar with any kind of turn-based combat, you’ll pick this up in one turn. After a few battles, you’ll probably know the bulk of the mechanics and nifty tricks.

I don’t think the game is that hard, but that doesn’t make it any less addictive. There have only been two battles I’ve had to save scum repeatedly to get through, and I’m pretty sure I wasn’t supposed to be rushing that far ahead on the map to begin with. My lowbie mercs with ratty weapons weren’t doing too hot against the security squad with full heavy armor, super soldier drugs, high-end small arms, and a machine gun emplacement.

But we eventually beat the fight with only one casualty, my only dead merc of the game. (Not counting my exiled merc dying like an idiot in some auto-complete battle for his outpost.)

That tough-as-hell fight was where I learned that positioning is everything. Once I figured out the best mechanics for moving and grouping the squad, it became very difficult for us to lose.

And what about the income from diamond mines? 

I’m not one for rushing games, but the diamond mines with limited lifespans made me feel like I should. I spent a good amount of time building up the squad on the first part of the map, then just blitzed through everything else, capturing every diamond mine I could. 

From what I figure, the mines shouldn’t be a problem for most players. I’ve already run two or three of them to empty and I still have a hefty income and over $1M saved up. I’m three squares from what I assume is the final battle of the story, which is why I decided to take a break to write this review and put off that sad feeling when I finish a game that I really enjoy.

PROBLEMS --

I agree with many other reviewers about the UI annoyances. On the overland map, it’s really easy to accidentally send a squad running all over the map with a wrong click. Since that often means that they will run into a fight you didn’t intend on starting, it’s pretty irritating. Sometimes it just means they get on a boat and haul ass halfway around the world before you can stop them. Not the end of the world, but it does mean more time resting and traveling, which in the early game could be bad when you’re pinching pennies. 

Nothing else comes to mind in terms of “needing fixing”. Yeah, some of the clicking is fiddly, and sometimes it’s a real pain to find the sweet spot on a crate or something, but that’s about it. 

I guess if I had my druthers, some easier way to re-up the merc contracts might be nice. Early in the game, when I could only afford short contract terms, it felt like I was clicking through the hire/rehire screen quite a bit.

Storage is a pain, but I’ve learned to live with it. Maybe I’m missing something, but I just stash all my loot in whatever sector I happen to be in to clear inventory space. That leaves me forgetting where anything is, but I don’t know of a better method. (I hoard weapons needlessly, so it’s probably my fault.) 

Oh, and the ammo inventory situation is abysmal. It’s really hard to tell what you’ve got. Apparently, someone already fixed that with a mod, but it looked like the mod broke a lot of people’s games, so I’m not messing with it. 

I would say the over-the-top dialogue and one-liners could be tightened up a little, but I’m warming up to it. After a couple of hours, I just stopped hearing it because…well…you hear the lines a lot. On the plus side, Steroid did finally say something hours into the game that made me laugh. Took a while to get there, but it was enough to earn him some credit.

WHAT I’D LIKE TO SEE --

More. I want more mercs, more weapons, and more places to explore.

There are a pretty decent number of weapons, but I just want more variety for variety’s sake. If I’m being honest, the selection is pretty good already. Some of the more fun (distinctive) weapons appear to be lootables from specific fixed locations or are obtained by side quests, which means I don’t think you can load up your whole squad with Colt Commandos. (I’ve only found one.)

Speaking of the forgotten CAR-15, I’m disappointed I couldn’t affix the giant flash hider that made it so iconic. Fix that, devs! Top of the list! ;P


Next on my list would be more places to go. Expand the map, give me a new region. Whatever the DLC provides, I will eagerly snatch up. I would love to take my squad on ongoing adventures for hundreds more hours. That appeals to me far more than starting over with new mercs. 

Last priority for me would be more mercs. What I would -really- prefer is a more complete system for creating mercs. I’d really like to have some, even small, control over base appearance.

[list]
[*]Even though I have sufficiently powerful hardware, the game tends to falter from time to time. This issue is not only about frame rate drops, but primarily about difficulties with fluid character movement and the use of the user interface.

[*]The stealth kill function is not always reliable. The aiming interface sometimes refuses to cooperate, not disappearing after selecting a specific body part for attack. The character begins to move when it shouldn't, and I still can see the aiming interface, from which the only way out is to cancel the action. This usually ruins my strategy and forces me to reload the game.

[*]The equipment module definitely needs a redesign. It is currently unintuitive and does not offer the possibility of sorting items, which significantly reduces the comfort of using it.

JA2 was my first strategy (together with Commandos) and I must have finished it maybe 15 times together with all its expansions and larger mods. I am very happy that JA3 is upholding the legacy of its predecessor with honor (in contrast to previous attempts of different studios).

I like everything that's been taken over from JA2.

There are some criticisms though:
- AI, especially in larger numbers, is completely dumb. For example, during missions in Prison or General's camp, some enemies just keep standing until they're sniped by your mercs. It is especially noticeable when you have Livewire and intel on the location so you can see where everyone is (this skill is extremely OP in my view)
- switching from turn based mode to real time when no enemies are around works poorly. It works when no enemies are alerted but when they are, they are often too stupid to engage in a combat until you find them, which means you're stuck in turn based for 15 turns trying to find the last hiding enemy, which is really annoying.
- no systematic way to buy weapons and ammo (it's not like you don't have enough of either though, it's just nice to have)
- I'm 37 hours in the game and the variety of weapons seem quite small so far and weapon balance overall could be better (hoping for mods here). For instance, I didn't find any reason to use 5.56 weapons because the lower AP simply doesn't compensate lower firepower.
- I'm not a fan of the weapon mods and crafting ammo although I understand that's an alternative to the former online store with guns and equipment

I might update my review after my second play through on a higher difficulty. I wanted to write this early to give support to the devs.

Go buy it.

[b]Check out our 60 hour review on [url=https://youtu.be/FH4SlMwd8jA]2 Headed Hero![/url][/b]

Ignore what the grumpy old grognards have to say. This game is a strategy RPG tour de force that supersedes Jagged Alliance 2 in every conceivable way. Sure, it's not eye-bashingly gorgeous, some of the humor is cringey, and some of the models and UI elements could be a little better. The co-op is also a bit janky and maybe not totally suited to the game's design. 

But look at what you GET. 

A giant pile of quests, more quality interactions, deeper combat, gorgeous environments packed with secrets, better management options, and a boatful of QOL and accessibility features all make this the best Jagged game the series has seen. After so many mediocre JA spinoffs, it's a dream come true. Plus with a ton of mods already coming out in the Workshop, I'm just waiting for some madman to make a full port of JA2 so I can get the best of both worlds.

The core issue is - the SirTech's 3 bar (health/stamina/morale) system was genius - my heavily armored merc with ceramic plates, treated spectra vest would get hit, and would lose stamina, which means less AP per turn, less shots, less movement.  Recall that in JA2 a merc who is repairing items is constantly losing max stamina, which will require 3-12 hours of sleep to replenish. Over two decades, JA2 modding has perfected this system - they added suppression, armor coverage (where that vest would only cover 85% and would fail to mitigate any damage in 15% of cases). So the ""old"" game has a lot of ways to lose AP, and a lot of ways for the AI to push and challenge the player.

Without the stamina system, the heal/repair/train outside combat system loses meaning and gets replaced with a static ""2 days to train a merc"" or ""1Day 13 hours to heal your 5 wounds"". JA3 does not have sleep, but has some weird ""idle for 12 hours"" mechanic.

Let's look at JA3 - the AP number is static, +1 for well rested, -1 for fatigued with maybe 4-5 being able to carry over, there's some ""free movement"" AP. And here comes the problem - apart from ""called shots"", there is no way to effectively suppress an enemy (like I don't know what ""suppressed"" status even does in JA3). This means that game keeps throwing gimmicks like shotgun using, retaliating troops that just rush your position and keeps shooting back at you. 

Lack of any meaningful AP/Suppression means that most fights play out very similarly, until the game throws a ""Rocket man"" at you - those can nuke your squad from ridiculous distances (like 40-50 damage AOE every turn while they hang back behind their buddies that charge you in melee). It's no surprise that I've not seen the ""grenadier"" enemy ever throw grenade - that would be just too unbalanced. 

Let's look at ""destructible"" environments. While playing JA2, I can position a 7.62x51 rifle user behind a wall and consistently shoot enemies through that wall. Even if shots do little damage, they do damage and drain stamina/suppress the enemies. That made overwhelming fights on ironman possible. JA3 seems to have some sort of cosmetic destructible environments, but I've never seen a partial cover penetration. I can blow away cover and then shoot exposed enemy, but I can not shoot and break through cover and damage an enemy with small arms.  

Stealth - just FUUUUUUUUUUUUU.... annoying as hell. Enemies are constantly moving, and can even a stealthy character in a matter of a few real life seconds. This means that I'm frantically clicking on the enemy, selecting headshot, adding 3 aim levels all in real time, just to attempt a ranged take down.

The list goes on and on. The silly ""run and shoot"" and ""run and shoot 3 times"" special skills for pistols and SMGs are extremely underwhelming. Consider the ""classes"" of JA2/ 1.13, such as a ranger which added free aim levels to shotguns, or a gunslinger which added free aim to pistols - these created real, distinct playstyles.

I don't remember the original JA2, but 1.13 has a great ""gun noise"" mechanic, with each gun attracting enemies in the 0-100 tiles range. A sniper rifle may have 75 noise rating, a high quality suppressor may cut this down to 20, and using subsonic ammo would drop this to 10, which would finally allow for a stealth sniping. The fact that JA3 allows me to mount a used oil filter (for 20 parts) on any rifle and achieve ""silent attacks"" status is ridiculous and creates unsolvable game mechanics issues, which were attempted to be patched by giving enemy ridiculous amounts of free movement, shotguns and free retaliation shots. 

I still have JA2/1.13 installed in a Wine bottle on my Mac, running in crossover. This feat of engineering reminds me that I'm running one of the last - 2014 builds of the game. It has Urban Chaos and 1.13 mods installed. It's impossible to think that the creators of JA3 did not know of what has been done on the JA2 engine, and why it created a robust game. Instead, they went for the visuals, and in process have broken the key elements that made JA2 a masterpiece.

But that doesn't mean there isn't room for a direct sequel to one of the original franchises of the genre. After 2 decades of failed spin-offs and attempts to update the formula, Jagged Alliance 3 is a solid hit. I knew the developers of Tropico would get atmosphere and music right.

To make a story that is better than JA2's, in a more coherent setting. 

It doesn't have the gameplay variety JA2 had in its final state, yet. But there is plenty of interesting tactical puzzles to solve and personalities to manage. What's more, the choice and consequence in this narrative is near CRPG level. Decisions you make early on WILL affect later events. For good or ill. 

There are some minor graphical glitches (which some reviews have reported as gameplay imbalance. But aren't in fact.) And the economy needs to give the player more incentive to spend money.

Second, the controls are clunky, particularly controls related to stealth are annoying -- why do I have to use the right mouse key sometimes and the left others? Even with a stealth-oriented character (like Mouse), it's very difficult to sneak up on someone, so this game really rewards range rather than melee. Which begs the question, why don't I just have a team of all marksmen? Of course, if you do that, then it's way too easy.

This is JA, a real one, not a lame remake. This is what we've been waiting for for 24 years and it finally arrived. It feels like the first two, it plays similar and I feel like a young kid again playing it daily.
There are a balance issues and a few bugs, other mentioned absence of pause at the deployment phase - I think that can be fixed with ""always TB"" toggle in the game options. All of that is minor stuff that I'm sure will be fixed. The JA2 out of the box wasnt an ideal game either, then there were patches and modders made it perfect. But you can't fix a game that doesn't exist and it exists now, so we are blessed with its presence.

Heaven and hell! Jagged Alliance is back and it's like a mercenary hopped in a time machine and erased all the mistakes of the past two decades. JA3 brings me straight back to the '90s, minus the dreadful hairdos and with far superior graphics.

The gameplay? As crisp as the first bite into an apple 🍏 and just as sweet. Turn-based strategy is back in fashion and feels as good as when you first played Jagged Alliance 2 and realized that sleep is highly overrated.

Character development? More profound than a conversation with a philosophy student 🎓. The mercenaries aren't faceless goons anymore, they're MY mercenaries and woe betide the enemy who dares to touch them. I've spent more time perfecting their skills than I care to admit. But hey, who needs real social interaction when you've got a squad of mercenaries adoring you?

And then there's the tale of how this game almost cost me my relationship. It was 2 a.m., the Battle of Drassen was in full swing and my girlfriend walks in and says, ""It's either me or Jagged Alliance."" Without hesitation, I naturally chose... my mercenaries. She threw a shoe 👟 at my screen, hit my best marksman, and got him killed in the heat of battle. I'd be lying if I said I didn't consider pressing charges for assault. After a week on the couch and a serious discussion about priorities, we're thankfully back together and she understands that Jagged Alliance is not competition, but an enrichment. And she promises to aim away from my screen next time.

The difficulty level? Higher than my caffeine consumption during those endgame nights ☕. But what's a game if it doesn't kick your ass and leave you asking for more?

In conclusion, JA3 is the perfect mix of nostalgia and innovation that we all needed without knowing it. It's like someone shoved the joy and pain of JA2 into a modern game engine and the result is nothing short of a masterpiece. So folks, put on your camo, sharpen your knives and join the revolution. Deidranna waits and this dictator isn't going anywhere by herself!

Negative imho:
- Sectors are too small. Every sector is just one instant battle as all enemies are on to you after the first shot. 
- There's a lack of ammunition, why is there no webshop for ammo & weapons?
- The in-game help is lacking
- Stealth is broken
- World could be bigger
- Hitting enemies does not seem to reduce their movement range? Unsure about this, but quite often I almost kill butchers only for them to run across half the map to slash me with a knife.

Positive:
- It has the basic JA mechanics
- It feels like JA2
- Graphics are quite nice
- Mercs are fun. I keep Fox and Buns just to enjoy their hateful remarks about each other
- I like goofy but serious storytelling

Positive rating because it's fun to play, but it really needs some adjustments.

[edit]

Forgot to mention, I'm playing on steam deck and it works very well. I own a gaming laptop as well, but I see no reason not to play this on deck.

**This review is going to be super long and detailed so the TLDR is this game is incredible and 100% worth it if you enjoyed JA2 vanilla, or even 1.13, or if you just like strategic/tactical management games.**

I'll start with the bad news first, things I don't personally enjoy, but that are true to JA2 vanilla - which is really what most fans asked for - JA2 but newer.

- This game isn't based on the extremely popular 1.13 mod, which most JA2 have been playing for years - it's a more mature and complex version of JA2 that die hard fans of the series have become accustomed to. So, if you are expecting 1.13 rules, you will be disappointed, somewhat.

- There is no way to sell guns or ammo, so you have to rely on gems / diamonds / mines for income, which makes early game fairly challenging, and mistakes will cost you much more early on.

- The complexity of the game actually increases over time due to some basic QOL features that managing multiple squads really requires. Ideally you want to go from extreme micromanagement, to a more broad strategic management gameplay (with an option to micromanage as needed). But, the way the game is designed you will unfortunately need to micromanage a LOT of elements of the game and do it even more toward end game which really can slow down the pace of the game. Hoping mods will fix this over time.

- There is no real time pause - which can create some really frustrating random situations which shouldn't really be an element in a strategic game. The enemy very rarely makes mistakes in this game, so why would my extremely highly trained mercenary squad not have enough time to take cover and get noticed by a random goofball? That makes no sense.

- The turn based mode doesn't end, and you have no way to end it, when you do not have enemy contact for multiple turns, which makes moving your squad around chasing down the one guy or animal that is hiding from you super time consuming and unnecessarily tedious.

- The squad limit is frankly too small, it should be more like 10 mercs. Occasionally you will be going up against possibly 20+ enemies at once and having to manage two squads because for some arbitrary reason six is the right number of mercs for a squad can make things unnecessarily tedious to manage. It's a sandbox, let us choose whatever squad size we want.

- Gear does not show up on mercs. My guess is this was a design choice to cut down on development time, but it really takes away from the fun of customizing and outfitting mercs. It's disappointing to upgrade gear only to have your mercs look exactly the same on Day 1 as they do on Day 200.

- Inventory management is a nightmare and constant struggle. Because there is no squad vehicle, there is no where to store all of the gear and other random stuff you need to carry around constantly, and the ""squad bag"" or whatever doesn't allow you to put gear in it. I basically had to designate a sector as a junkyard, in the middle of the map, and have my squads return to this ""base"" to resupply. At times I feel like some of my items disappeared - I could be wrong, but I feel like I can't trust my stuff just laying around in a sector unsupervised, this makes little sense. Also, just even the item limits feel kind of silly. A mortar takes up two items slots, the same amount of space that two bags of 10 tiny diamonds take up. You can't explain that! 

- The game has been streamlined (dumbed down) to some extent and some key elements are missing like fatigue during fights, merc weight, merc camo, and some other very micromanagy things from JA2 which I actually personally enjoyed.

- Militia limit is too small. Why can we only train 8 militia in a sector? Limits should be based on sector size. Some sectors are much smaller than others and probably need like 4 people max. Some could use 20. Another arbitrary limit that makes little sense. Also, sectors which have a larger militia size should be able to slowly train and replenish the militia without you having to constantly go back and spend days retraining everyone. The point of TRAINING a militia is so that it can be at least somewhat self-sustaining.

- The music is not as iconic as it was in the early JA games, I wish they had brought back the original composer - who is also a really good dude as I found out when I got a chance to chat with him about his JA2 soundtrack. That music really created a great action-movie atmosphere which I feel is somewhat lacking in JA3.

That all said, though, I feel like these complaints are mostly nitpicking a really nicely done game that hits a lot of the right points the fans have asked for, for years.

The positives:

- If you liked JA2, you will feel right at home. There is practically zero learning curve if you have played JA2 and it ""feels really good to be back"". I kept pausing during my playthrough and just thinking - man, this feels just like JA2 but better and I can't believe this is actually happening.

- Less mercs overall but still a decent amount of old favorites and new faces. Some are much more annoying than others, which I also actually enjoy, because it creates and interesting dynamic for the player. For example, I had a squad member who was amazing but also extremely irritating to me, and when I had to make a strategic choice whether to save him in a fight or let them perish, these factors played into my decision. The mercs I feel are well enough voice acted.

- Mods. Obviously the addition of modding is an incredible benefit for all, and a huge testament to the devs really wanting to make something the players can enjoy for a long time. As much as I love JA2, managing the mods was fairly tedious, and having a dedicated JA3 Steam workshop is going to give this game life until I die probably - which is all that most fans asked for. Give us an MVP sandbox with good tools and we will make it great - and the devs did exactly that.

- Atmosphere. The game really stands on its own two feet and provides and incredible sandbox atmosphere with environmental storytelling, tons of side missions, a great UI, and everything just - FEELS GOOD. The devs did an incredible, and difficult, job of recreating the feeling of JA2 from a visual and immersion aspect.

- The map is massive, with an almost overwhelming amount of content to explore. I have probably close to 60-70 actual hours in this game (I played for a week offline while my internet was down, so that time wasn't captured by Steam), and I have explored probably HALF of the map so far.

- Player choices have real consequences. The design of the missions I feel is very solid, creating a lot of opportunity for replayability. Sometimes you make a certain choice because you want to, sometimes you do it because you have to. The way you play the game influences how you make decisions, which is incredible.

- Good amount of challenge, especially early game. The game becomes much less challenging over time if you are a JA veteran, but to me that's ok. The point of the game is, I am in charge of an ELITE mercenary team, which of course should absolutely be wiping the floor with enemies in the end game. I love that the ""bosses"" are not insane bullet sponges that are unrealistic, they are just other skilled combatants, just like you. It feels logical and natural, to progress in this game.

- Lots of customization and weapons. This was always a huge draw of JA2 for me, to be able top outfit my mercs exactly how I want without a need to min/max things. Mistakes happen and that's ok. This game does a great job balancing your ability to explore and try things out, and punishing you for sub-optimal choices.

- The ability to save manually. I know this will be controversial, but I feel in a sandbox game like this the option to manually save at any point is absolutely ESSENTIAL to a good player experience. I should be able to craft my story how I want to.",1690474624,1690474624,True,2,0,0.500996232032775879,1,True,False,False

Huge praise to Haemimont Games and THQ Nordic for a job well done! Let's just say that playing JA3 or Season 1 of Diablo 4 is not even a choice for me - JA3 wins every time. Though, to be fair, Diablo 4 was one of those games that did not meet my expectations - not even close. Let me put it another way - I really wanted to write a good review for JA3 (the first review I bother to write for any game), but I kept postponing because I'd rather play the game instead. This should tell you everything you need to know, but if you want to know more, keep reading.

JA3 feels to me just like JA2 did back in the day - fun, unique, and addictive - I have officially ruined my sleeping schedule since the game came out - the ""one more sector/one more battle"" excitement has returned stronger than before. Let's break it down:

1. Visuals - the game looks great, no question about it. The environments are immersive and beautiful, and the weather effects (which also affect combat) are the cherry on top. Could it be better? Yes, especially the character models could have been a bit more detailed, but honestly, I don't play the game to be able to see the pimples on the mercs' faces, and if it helps to run the game on slower machines so more people can enjoy it - I am all for that. The only thing I wish was there was a toggle between visualizing the armor the mercs are wearing or keeping their original look. Right now we only have the original look as an option whereas I enjoy having a heavily armored team to look at. That being said, I have a strong suspicion somebody will make a mod for that sooner or later.

2. Gun sounds, party banter, ambiance and music - all excellent in my opinion, especially the music - when you free the first village or do something heroic, you'll get the vocalized ""hero"" music and you'll see what I mean. The tracks are memorable and some of the battle music is downright inspiring. Overall the sound atmosphere is top notch.

3. Gameplay - the user interface is quite intuitive, at least for a JA2 veteran. I'm not sure if that will be the case for a newcomer, but I don't think there's any unnecessary clutter on the UI, in fact it looks pretty slick. I also love the fact that you don't see the percentage chance-to-hit, although I know a lot of people hate it. This can easily be fixed with a mod (I believe it's Haemimont's mod that does that, actually, though it would have been simpler to just have it as a toggle in the options somewhere). The battles are fun and you can do well with many different playstyles, though my favourite one - an all-sniper team - seems to be a bit on the overpowered side. Or at least that's what I thought until I saw what a machine gunner with the right build can do solo. Having enough bullets is literally their only problem.

4. Character progression - the perks are a great addition and once you learn your way around them, you can make some brutally efficient and even broken builds for your mercs. On top of that, all mercs (except the custom IMP merc you can make) have a unique talent which makes them truly special. The combinations and build options are limitless - sky's the limit here. Also, training is now more efficient and you also have access to replenishable skill books, though they are time-gated - the book vendors' inventory respawns every 5 in-game days or so, so you can keep coming back to buy books, and you can also save-scum to farm the specific ones you need. Granted, you only get one book per vendor per refresh (so two in total, unless I somehow missed a hidden vendor), but it's still a great addition on top of training and natural progression (especially for stats which are difficult to progress naturally, such as Wisdom).

5. Quests and references - quite a few quests are present in the game - some short, some much more involved, on top of the main questline, which was one of the many pleasant surprises of JA3. Many of them are directly inspired by or contain some sort of pop culture reference ranging from Mad Max: Fury Road to the ever-controversial loot boxes. The larger quests have multiple outcomes and in order to get the best outcomes for some, you will need to do some heavy investigating, which is a breath of fresh air.

6. Battles - while some are easier than others, there are some iconic battles which will challenge both newbies and veterans alike. On top of that, the weather and time of day can make a battle play out completely differently from what you'd expect and work either for you or against you.

7. Mercs - the mercs I have tried were fun to play and the interactions between them definitely contributed to the atmosphere. You can also get 5 free ones as you progress with your mission, but all of them you have to work for, it's not as easy as meeting and recruiting them right away. Most of them are pretty mediocre in terms of stats (Larry and Smiley in particular), but you can train them to be your B-team, or even work on them to reach viable status by camping them out in a choke-point sector. Playing the battles manually with them will net you a ton of Marksmanship and Dexterity points, some Agility and even Strength if you melee with them, as well as XP. Auto-resolve mostly just gets you XP but as they get hurt, you can heal them and get some Health and Medicine points with no effort at all. Not to mention that the manual fights are just fun and don't feel like a grind, and the weather conditions make every battle play out differently, even in the same sector. In fact, my first completed game was with my IMP merc and the 5 free mercs and they were beasts once trained up.

8. Final thoughts - the game is so much fun that I am even trying to get all the Steam achievements - not because I care about those, but because it challenges me to try different setups and approaches which get me out of my comfort zone and allow me to appreciate the game even more. Also, the game supports mods, and knowing the JA2 community, I am really looking forward to all the content, balancing and overhaul mods. I feel like this game is going to live a long life - long enough to hopefully see a fourth installment down the road.

Defending sectors is garbage. You have nearly no time to place your team and give some overwatch orders. As these attacks are no surprise attacks but attacks you make the enemy do or the enemy even calls out to attack you...I think there should be a chance to set up defences.
The game still have some bugs. Like two groups of enemies start fighting eachother instead of working together.

The characters of the mercenaries are very nice. They have good backstories and they have nice ways to talk to eachother.

Humour is spot on, combat feels pretty nice albeit its rather easily abuseable (not necessarily a bad thing time to time...) There are plenty of small tasks and things to do, new weapons to  find.. I'm quite certain i will be going to play 1 or 2 runs after I properly finish my first campaign run.
Every grid is custom made and even though they arent all that big, they bring a lot of map variance onto the table. Aiming system may be rather aggravating on occasions but once you get your weapon upgrades and levels up to acceptable levels then firefights will become rather enjoyable experiences.
Only thing im surprised by is the fact I havent found a lightsaber yet.. Its jagged Alliance. Poking fun at pop culture is its thing.

I would come back to it time and time again, especially after the 1.13 update. When I found out there will be a ""true"" next Jagged Alliance 3 I was skeptical at first... Ugh, sigh, I sound like an infomercial. Anyway, this game is a good child of JA2! It is fun, complex, a bit ruff around the edges, but it has that feel, that randomness that so many of us cherished in the age of JA2, in a time when open world games were far between. This game.. oh man.. it has potential to grow, i m already salivating in anticipation for any DLCs, haven't tried multiplayer and I am still to finish the game on hard difficulty without taking any unnecessary saves.

The CONs?
 The UI is a bit clunky and not very intuitive. The selection of mercs can lead to misclicks and you have a guy shooting with a shotgun instead of a silenced pistol.
There are a few things i would do to improve the AI and their charging mechanics.
The inventory system is a step back from JA2. Etc.
However, I see that the mods are coming in and the community is already working hard on polishing this beautiful pearl to perfection.
Anyone that loves X-COM style games and similar real-time tactical games.. you ll love it.

I'm on an RTX 4090/i9-13900k and after skyrocketing GPU temps and constant crashes (including a hard crash that actually just shut down my PC), I'm actually worried about bricking my hardware, so I'm putting this game to the side for now.

I've tried turning down shadows, reflections, limiting FPS, and I still am struggling to get through single missions without crashing.  After searching for answers, I found I'm not alone ( it does seems like AMD is faring better for what it's worth).   I did finally slow down crashes running at 1080p with everything turned down to medium, but that's not really the experience I was expecting.

If you don't mind the game looking low-res, then you can probably still have some fun with this, but some hardware configurations are simply unable to play this at high fidelity right now.

The writing and setting is great and the banter between the different mercs as well as reactions keeps the game fresh over time.

My only gripe with the game is that you can't really synch up stealth kills - it seems real time movement like climbing a cliff wall with one merc will prevent you from taking a shot with another. In other words, there is a ""turn order"" even when outside of combat. Once you hit one merc in stealth, anyone nearby may alert everyone else. Therefore you can't have two snipers shoot both targets at the same time to avoid the alert. Missed opportunity here I feel for some really cool maneuvers, especially in multiplayer.

If you are new to the series, it might seem a bit silly at times. The mercs are still fun and their banter can be entertaining. I like that they kept moderately destructible environments. 

I am on the fence about some things that could have used an upgrade. I know they didn't want to add armor visuals and such so they don't look all the same, but it would be nice to have the option. Let us decide what they look like within reason. I see where they were going, but at the same time it's really really hard to accept equipping people in heavy armor and they still just show a sport's bra or something. A solid compromise could be a generic armored version of each Merc that is still unique to them and not gear specific would be something. That would also only require one extra model each instead of something modular, which I don't think is a very tall order.

Jagged Alliance 3 succeeds in delivering an exhilarating experience that will undoubtedly please both long-time fans and newcomers to the franchise. As an ardent supporter of the series, diving into the game felt like a nostalgic trip down memory lane, with all the elements that made its predecessor a classic still intact. However, it doesn't shy away from implementing exciting new game mechanics and boasting fresh, modern visuals that add a breath of fresh air to the beloved franchise.

One of the most satisfying aspects of Jagged Alliance 3 is how it manages to preserve the essence of the original games. The turn-based combat system remains at the core, allowing players to meticulously plan their moves and execute strategies with precision. The familiar mercenaries from past games make a return, each with their unique traits, and recruiting and building the perfect squad is as engrossing as ever.

While the game remains loyal to its tactical roots, Jagged Alliance 3 introduces some streamlined elements that make the experience more accessible to a broader audience. This newfound accessibility might concern some purists, but it doesn't detract significantly from the overall enjoyment. Instead, it strikes a delicate balance, welcoming new players while offering a satisfying challenge for veterans.

Visually, Jagged Alliance 3 truly shines. The developers have taken full advantage of modern technology to craft stunning environments and character models that bring the world of Arulco to life. The attention to detail is commendable, and the game's visual fidelity does justice to the classic series while elevating it to a contemporary standard.

The story, too, is captivating, building on the events of previous games while presenting a fresh narrative that keeps players engaged throughout their journey. The diverse missions and objectives ensure that gameplay never becomes monotonous, offering a mix of stealth, combat, and exploration that keeps players on their toes.

Despite some of the changes that may feel less tactical than its predecessors, Jagged Alliance 3 ultimately delivers an entertaining and captivating gaming experience. The marriage of old memories with exciting new mechanics and impressive visuals makes it a worthy addition to the franchise. Whether you are a long-time fan or a newcomer, Jagged Alliance 3 is a must-play for any tactical RPG enthusiast.",1690408443,1690408443,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off it looks amazing. It sounds amazing. It is exactly what you expect out of a Jagged Alliance game. Don't fix what isn't broken and give your (paying) customers what they want.

In all seriousness though, this game requires a sense of humor if you want to get the most out of it. Part of it's charm is the constant pop culture references, the stereotypes, tropes, and satire.

For those, like me, who are new to the series. JA3 is a big dumb action movie with one liners, explosions, and a decent story. Filled with fan favorite mercs, and some new faces to add to the roster. You lead them on a fictional island where the story will take you along some cliche paths and very obvious twists. But will do so with a wink and a smile. 

Turn based tactical battles

These are the meat, and you'll get in lots of firefights. Moving your mercs on the strategic map from square to square. For me they quickly got dull and repetitive and I found myself hitting the 'auto resolve' or navigating around encounters. This is a red flag for me in most games of this type. 

The issue is that most firefights can be solved with either snipers, heavy machine guns or explosives. There is no real 'chess level depth' playing with skills, it's just surface stuff, even with weather conditions etc. It won't push anyone with experience in these type of games, even with the settings tweaked right up. And the AI is ok, but not great. No real objectives other than kill everyone and move on. 

You can 'stealth splinter cell' your way through the pre battle real time phase, but I found it clunky more than satisfying.

Character development and Customization

As is very clear from the game's presentation, the mercs are a big part of the game. They come in various levels from recruit to legendary, but the customization is limited to weapons mods. Their aesthetics, and personalities are set, and armor doesnt show. This is the game's way of telling you their personalities are integral to the story and series. 

But you can create one single free merc who you can name, but still have only a small handful of prebuilt looks and avatar images. In short, if you enjoy spending hours on character creation screens, developing your own team or looking at customization mods for XCOM...then this game doesn't do that. 
Level ups were also a non event for me. They are by no means bad, but they don't feel rewarding, and I was still just mainly doing the same snipe stuff, blow stuff up. 

Story, writing and merc interaction. 

Now, as the mercs' personalities are cherished, they are set in stone. And they like to chat...a lot. Which at first is really funny, with some genuinely amusing quips. But after the numberless firefights, I really grew tired of Fox making innuendos about pretty much everything, or MD telling me how bad he is at hiding. I just wanted them to shut up and go do the thing I clicked them to do. But that is the JA vibe, and some mercs I just refused to take because they were so annoying...even at the expense of them making my team better. 
There is a lot of random and repetition, which overwhelms the less frequent moments where the one liners are funny. Or two mercs have a conversation you haven't heard yet. 

The story is ok, just an excuse for mass murdering via sniper rifles and pipe bombs. Characters will jump in and say different things during the static dialogue as per their personalities. Again you will either be amused or it'll start to grate. This is their show and story, not yours. 

Conclusion

Jagged Alliance 3 has a lot to offer, and I didn't experience any bugs. It's a big loud friend who wants to make you laugh with bad jokes, lewd jokes, and explosions. It's just shallow and is a one trick pony fans of the series will love and cherish regardless. 

If you are coming from the more heavyweight tactical hitters, or like a lot of customization and telling your own stories, then JA3 might not satisfy. ",1690397724,1690397724,False,2,1,0,0,True,False,False

JA2 was one of those standout games that you remember with affection for decades and still holds up, more or less.

The main thing I like about JA3 is how close it is to JA2: both the tactical combat and the strategic ""campaign"" layer are very close to JA2 in terms of gameplay. (I know some fellow JA2 veterans are grumbling about specific things, but JA3 feels much closer to JA2 than, for example the rebooted X-Coms do to the 1990s original.) Consequently, everything I loved about JA2, I love about JA3 too. The mechanics are generally better for me too - specifically installing the chance to hit mod and being able to see cover (X-Com style) makes it so much easier to micro-manage the fights (which is what I want out of a turn based isometric tactics game). 

This extends to the ""feel"" of the game - the atmosphere, the characters, the story etc. It just feels like playing a modern JA2. It gets the mood and experience perfectly. The reason it exceeds my expectations is that I was not sure from the preview material that it could do this. Some reviews criticised the writing and characters - but nearly all the Ja2 mercs are back and most sound very similar. I can get the ""old gang"" together again. In fact, I think overall the ""feel"" of the game is superior to JA2 - there is more dialogue and the music is wonderful. 

I don't find many downsides to the game. The thing it needs most is a button you can press to go into turn-based - it's too hard to set up an ambush in real time as an enemy patrol is marching towards you unaware. A ""switch to turnbased on sighting the enemy"" would serve the same purpose. I did find the big ""twist"" between Act 1 and Act 2 a bit problematic - it came too early for me, but maybe that kind of clunkiness is inevitable trying to create a linear story with a completely open world where the player can do sectors in any order they like. 

It's one of the best games I've bought in the last 5 years. Immediately after I finished it on normal, I started up a game on commando - it's that kind of game, you just don't want to stop playing.",1690379476,1690379476,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The original Jagged Alliance came out almost 30 years ago (1995, has it been that long? Holy Moly!) and was a blend of small squad tactical combat against numerous enemies in the fight to liberate Metavira. Coming on the heels of X-Com UFO Defense (1994) those two games really nailed down the tactical combat genre in a way that perhaps has never been surpassed. I frankly don't think it's been done better in that time span and it seems only right that within a couple of weeks of each other, two modern games are released that are tributes to those classics in Jagged Alliance 3 and Xenonauts 2.

If you never played the first game, let's set the stage. You control a force of mercenaries you recruit, pay and manage in an effort to restore a country to its proper leader and overthrow those who illegally seized power. The majority of the game takes place in the tactical layer, which takes place on various map squares (there's a bunch - maybe 000 or more). Your control your 6 person squad on these maps where you explore, loot and fight your way through the henchmen of the opposition forces. Once you make contact with the enemy, the game switches to turn based and you fight in turn-based glory. Anyone who has played tactical games of this ilk will be very familiar with the combat - hide behind cover, use the various weapons and skills to beat the enemy. 

Probably the biggest difference in title is you don't see the % it takes to hit. By not giving you the exact ""to hit"", the game doesn't seem as numbers driven or quit as unfair when you miss a shot.  Each merc has a number of APs which drives how many actions they can take in a round. You can use some APs to improve your hit chance and/or aim for a particular body part. Your mercenary troops will be scrounging for weapons, ammo and other upgrades to make them a more effective killing force.

On the strategic layer, you'll move from map to map, rest your forces when needed, worry about finances, contract with the merc recruiters and the mercs themselves, tracking quests, reading email and the like. Much like trying to take back over Metavira in the first game, this time you're managing the battle on the mythical African country of Grand Chien. You'll build militia forces, train mercs, heal injuries and plan your next step. 

What really set the original JA apart was not only the tight combat and the management layer but the campiness. Each merc was a stereotype with funny one-liners and general personality. Some characters were so utterly broken like Ruthless Reuban (a psychopath who may very well just kill someone on your squad) and others were almost superhuman (Mike!) but most all of them were delightful. Steroid's dialog - delivered in Ah-nuld's voice - was usually about his hulking biceps while Fox's thinly-veiled come ons were deliciously delivered in a sultry voice. Most JA remakes have missed the boat on this aspect of the game, which interjected constant humor in the face of constant battle. JA3 also gets this right - the voices are spot-on and the comments are chuckle-inducing.

Jagged Alliance 3 is really just Jagged Alliance 1 reincarnated and that's a good thing. If features the same characters from the first game with some of the very same lines. It has virtually the very same combat, similar progression and difficulty ramping. After 30 years, they came back to the same formula and it still works - showing how well the original game was designed and the trust these developers had in that original design.    

There are a couple of difficulty spikes and I've had the game freeze a couple of times or reloads but that's it. JA3 is a very, very faithful rendition of what made the original so much fun. For me, playing JA3 feels a bit like trying on an old beloved sweatshirt again and finding it still fits. Even after 30 years, the core game play loop, approach and systems all still work. And the devs of this title embraced that design and just brought it to a new audience. This is tactical based combat in all its glory and fun.

A couple things notably missing are the old footprints movement indicator, the percentage chance-to-hit, no real ""Bobby Ray's Guns and Things"" and the old-fashioned right-left squad move - I want that back!

On that note, mods. The devs had the forward thinking to include MOD SUPPORT right from launch and the modding community has not disappointed! Largely, if you can think of something you DON'T like, there's a mod for it.

Sadly, it does sound like we don't have much of the original voice actors for the various mercs, but the devs did try their best to retain the sound and feel of each merc and their personalities, including who likes who. Grunty and Ivan get along famously, whereas Buns and Fox do not. Certainly something done well.

Layout and gameplay wise, it does feel a little XCOM-ish here and there but this game feels a lot better than playing XCOM. Sneaking actually works but it certainly does feel a lot like silenced snipers are very much ""meta"" for gameplay for many things. Your mileage may vary, of course.

PROS: 
- Graphics
- Combat
- Level Design
- Commitment to Originals
- Price
- UI/Merc Management 

CONS:
- Mercs Can Be Too Vocal But Kudos For Tons of Voice Acting in this Game
- Mercs May Come Off As Too Cliche For Some
- Merc Gear Doesn't Change VIsual Appearence of Merc
- Settings & Character Perks May Seem A Bit Boring to Some XCOM Series Converts
- Movement Zones Appear A Bit Confusing to Look At, & You'll Be Constantly Changing Angle to see Cover, Make shots, & Grab Drops.
- Variety of Mercs, Also Some Seem OP, Some Seem Hardly Worth Hiring for $$$
- Budgeting can be tough with no way to sell weapons (besides breaking them into scrap & selling that)

ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND - I only hope the developer keeps rolling out requested features.

I haven't been this engrossed in a tactical strategy game in a long time to the point I was even thinking about it when I wasn't playing it.

It took me about 45 hours to beat one campaign, but that was with missing some pretty major side quest content. I can see a full playthrough taking over 50 hours easily. So I'd say it's easily worth the price and has tremendous replay value with all the different mercs.
I even started a second file the moment I had finished the campaign once.

The mercs themselves are great. There are some that stand out more than others  but this probably depends on the player.
The ones I used all had colorful personalities and good quips related to the story. 

Having never played a JA game befor this but playing games like Commandos and X-Com I feel like this is a fantastic addition to the strategy genre and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to  anyone who likes tactical strategy games.",1690225953,1690337801,True,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Terrible UI, really fun game. If you like cheesy, silly humor, fun tactical combat that's bogged down by a clunky UI this is very enjoyable all the way through. Mod support also gives the game a bit more cutomization and hopefully longevity in the future.

[h1]The Ramble[/h1]

Bad stuff first. The UI/UX is absolutely terrible. 

[list]
[*] Clicking on tiny little pixels in order to interact with an object
[*] Trying to move but instead select a merc over and over again
[*] Elevations resetting when selecting a merc in the same frickin room as another leading to the roof blocking selection
[*] Climbing ladders/overwatch/stance changing locking out user ability to select or command other units all in a system built around real time travel into turn based combat 
[*] Having to renew contracts every 14 days (max, and I understand the tradition of this but there's ways to modernize while keeping the flavor)
[*] Broken quests when done out of order
[*] Inventory management *gestures in general direction* all of this, and so on
[/list]

Good stuff (but in rambly mess format)

The humor is great. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but it's my bag of worms. It's old school humor littered with innuendos, references, hurrah explosions, and Omyrn humor ('I like food').

The combat (after the turned based kicks in) is great. The levels with elevation, line of sight, cover, weapons and skills all feel impactful. There's a lot of issues with overwatch shooting at indestructible walls but it's jank a player can work around. The side stories are consistently bonkers and interesting. Training system and the push of limited resource and some difficulty spikes rewards a kind of learning from failure. This may or may not be good depending on cups and tea but I sure as hell felt empowered on a second playthrough after getting absolutley blindsided on my first run.

The inventory management is annoying as poop but the time spent managing is rewarded with significant power. This goes doubly for planning out builds and having mercs that specialize in things. From an overwatch tonky chonk to a stealthy run around scouty-pants who's only job is to spot the enemies for the rest of the team there's a lot of valid playstyles. Snipey snipe, boomy splodey, run and gun, ma-shet-tey to the face. It's great.

The story is loosey goosey and interesting enough to finish the game but not enough to really be pulled in. The side stories and sandboxy conquering of sectors are where the fun's at. This game is carried by its combat and silly silly humor and is something best enjoyed with mind half off and just enjoying it. It doesn't take itself seriously and neither should anyone else.

The games have ALWAYS been frustrating but i seem to be playing a different version then everyone else because my mercs can't hit the barn side of a broad. yes I'm aiming, and using all the available AP to miss the shots over and over again, crouching or going prone behind cover does fuck all as their guys can mow you down with seemingly unlimited AP and 100% accuracy. I really really really wanted to like this game but its just frustrating to not be able to hit anything, or trying to sneak up on enemies and having to save scum to get my ""stealthy"" character close enough to do a melee attack. Tactics that are sound and SHOULD work (like sneaking up behind a guy while he's taking a piss) don't, they automatically spot you even with relatively high DEX and the special stealth ability (yes sneak mode is on).. if you have bad luck with RNG just stay away it's just going to be hours and hours of loading screens trying to do even the most menial of tasks.

There's always a *but* - I thought the campaign itself was very lackluster - no spoilers here but basically you're employed by Emma Lafontaine who wants you rescue her father the President. During the entirety of the game, you barely heard from her or for that matter the main villain except for a few soundbites here and there.

No cutscenes, no video - nothing to emphasize or to remind you of the stakes - my main attachment was to my Merc recruits and building them up which was a lot of fun.

The only major gripe i had, and many people have - is there's no STORE.

Between the lack of plot momentum, and no store - i think a huge opportunity was missed. 

It's so close to being great, but for me it fails short - initially i was going to do another full playthrough but i decided not to. I would still recommend this game for the nostalgia, it's a good game just not as great as it should have been.",1690334691,1690334691,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

• Sometimes strange weapons stats like really wrong magazines capacitys, damage and etc
- All soviet guns in game use 7.62x39, even AK-74. (Burst fire SVD in 7.62x39, bruh).
- UGLs are the best weapon in game. Pin point accurate, double max range of sniper rifles, indirect fire and explosive. Very unfun.
- lever action rifle in .44 is one of the best sniper weapon, better than M24.
- Pistol calibers and 5.56 (5.56 also very expensive) is useless due to too low damage.
- Damage depends not on calibre but just gun (.44 can do 15 and 40 damage).
- Some machineguns are laser cannons and i don't know it intended by devs or not.
• And one story element:
- Too typical shady evil guy, nobody know who he is.. but thousends are ready to die for him for some reason.

But three things i find truly horrible:
• No raycast check (or something similar) for attacks and interupts. You can wait for enemy in dorway and when he runs through, your merc will interrupt him when he had not yet get into the field of view, and merc will shoot the whole burst in the door frame (or landshaft, tree, column, etc). This worst problem in game for now in my opinion.
• MELEE ENEMIES, a damn knife do more damage than a 7.62x51 burst and they are buletsponges at the same time.
• WHY ALL CARS ARE EXPLOSIVE? You can just shoot a weapon nearby (without hit!) and it's ON FIRE ALREADY! Soon (1 turn/5 second) it's gonna blow and horribly injure anybody close enough and abolish building walls nearby. Cars typically are not build with unstable explosive properties in mind. It's transport, not suicide weapon for unintentional terrorism!

Well first of all, some have mentioned in social media that game isn't faithful to it's origins at all. That's absolute bull. Game in fact is very faithful to original. Actually game had way, way more subplots than I anticipated. JA3 is also pretty damn tough in the beginning and let's just say that after one very interesting plot development it got seriously hard on normal setting for awhile.

Bit more in depth. Strategy is very similar to JA2. Gain access/retake resources to make better group. One thing I wish game would've had is black market guns, like JA2 did, but this doesn't have that. You can buy equipment, but it's always person X selling one item Y, so in that regard it's very shallow. But training militia etc. is still there. You can attack sectors with multiple squads simultaneously (some people claimed this isn't possible, but it absolutely is possible, just wait until the other squad reaches sector and begin combat then).

Tactical game. Here the game really shines. It's streamlined exactly the right way. Initially when I saw the common ""overwatch"" feature I was like ""oh no, this will ruin the game"", but ie. that's quite interestingly implemented as first time my girl got shot very severely because of using it. Why? Cause activating overwatch means here, that he/she will move _out_ of cover into plain sight. If enemy doesn't get into your sector and fires you from other location, you're easily screwed. It's very effective, but can't be spammed like in the X-COM remake, which of course is a very good thing. AI is very mixed bad. One time my guy was in roof and enemy shot and damaged roof, so my soldier fell inside the building very near death. I though I have few turns to rush and save him as there weren't windows or doors to enemy's side, my guy being quite close. But when enemy turn happened, enemy climbed ladders to the roof, ran right next to that hole just created and shot my guy to death. Furious moment, yet also so cool to see something like that can happen. Then there are times enemies behavior is very erratic and nonsensical, like might stay in open even though there could've been some good cover to use. One big difference the game has to it's predecessors is that there's tons of guns. You get access to rifles and automatic weapons very early on. It's something that annoyed bit in the first couple titles, but here you get maybe bit too much too soon. I would've liked to be relied more on that black market feature I would've wished, mentioned before. Some of the maps though could/should be larger imo.

Graphics are plenty good. Only annoyance is that you can't identify if your merc has ie. helmet on. He/she will always look the same, apart guns. Talking to plot related characters there aren't any animated screens. Just well drawn pictures of characters. I thought this might annoy me a bit, but began to actually dig the simplicity.

Music and audio. Now this was a huge surprise to me. JA2 had that insanely short and repetitive soundtrack. To be honest ie. JA3 ""main"" combat soundtrack will be getting very familiar near end game, but then there's a lot of plot related events and solutions to those can occasionally trigger some insanely high quality music tracks that were pleasure to listen. Also before launch people seemed to diss game for not having mercs talk. That's completely wrong. Every single merc is voiced and more precisely they're voiced really well. There's also still some random interactions between characters. I played for like 30h on essentially two squads and there wasn't interactions virtually at all. But when I began to combine them attacking same sectors etc. I was surprised to see that there still are random talking, which was nice to hear occasionally. Do note that some voices now differ a bit from original, which is totally fine imo. I wasn't expecting them to find all the people that voiced characters. Main thing to me, that it's done really well generally speaking.

I won't go into plot to ruin it, but let's just say that there was _a lot of interactions_ and side missions. When game ends, there's pretty much exact copy from Fallout's where is told what has happened and in my ending it became very clear that some of my choices didn't quite play out like I thought. That being mentioned there's one character that can be convinced to change sides. It's actually quite multilevel thing were things could've gone wrong and in the end he was playable character and near end he actually died, but end game scene told he was alive and well, so there apparently can be some bugs in the game.

If you've actually read this far, you've already noticed that I loved this game and I will replay it sometime again to get bit different endings. Loved original JA, but it's now very dated. JA2 is still a great game, but it's that ""seen it, completed it few times"". JA3 in my opinion is absolutely 9/10 game with very little flaws and with good amount of re-playability.

Another part that I would like to alter is, that you can't buy ammunition (there is no Bobby Rays). Obviously the devs wanted to put more emphasis on the soldiers and their talents as well as certain key spots on the map (explo experts can craft ammo if they are near a repair shop).

To-date it might still be the best turn-based game I've played. There have been repeated tries to revitalize the JA name, all of which have been sub-par at best; fortunately, JA3 breaks the trend and is a fun and thoughtful continuation of the series. If you're a fan of turn-based games, you might as well go buy JA3 right now.

The Good:
The game does a great job during boots on the ground in-map missions.  The turn-based mechanics feel familiar (although perhaps a little too X-COM like) with elements such as partial cover, full cover, and overwatch cones. One critical design decision I enjoy is that your to-hit is not relayed as a %, but rather in terms of your mercenary's own commentary plus common sense (if I shoot at the guy behind the rock, I'll probably hit the rock). The sat-map world view is fun, and the regional management game it provides is fun enough (although not the game's high point). Lastly, the game's tone and tongue-in-cheek 1990's action movie aesthetic is absolutely fantastic and the story is fun enough (if not cliche, which is kind of the point). The voice acting is spot-on (though annoying in certain cases), and the mercenaries are a joy to hire.  All in all, if you're interested in the theme and like turn-based games there's little not to like in JA3's design.

Deserving its own paragraph is the game's modability.  JA3 is designed with modding in mind, and two weeks out we already have mods covering some of the game's strongest touch points (running out of money, lack of enemy drops (especially in terms of ammo), % to-hit (if that interests you), and inventory management).  The opportunities here are boundless, and I can't wait to see what the community comes up with.

The Bad:
The game is rough around the edges in that it's often not as responsive as you'd like. Inventory management is a chore, and the drop rate of enemies is pretty terrible. I wish there was better in-game help for describing what icons mean; you figure it out, but it can be rough going at first. Most importantly though, the decision to have the game in real-time until combat is initiated is frustrating at best. Combat often initiates because you're frantically trying to click on your opponent in order to get an aimed headshot in before you're noticed.  Due to my lack of dexterity, I'm about 50-50 in success; which is disappointing.  Fortunately most of this can be fixed with mods.

The Ugly:
Don't walk into this game thinking that every mercenary is going to fit your aesthetic. Some lines are cringeworthy at best (Fox, I'm looking squarely at you), but in context of the time and story, they weirdly make sense.  It's also harder on your graphics card than the game's graphics would suggest.  I also suspect there's a memory leak in there somewhere as game responsiveness does degrade over time.

True successor ! Feels like Jagged Alliance, and the last I could feel this way was with JA:Back in Action, tho that was a wee bit different game style-wise.

Other than a number of QoL improvements, the game feels awesome. Slight frustration when trying to set up ambushes, or starting combat, or trying to make stealth kills... 
Other than that the turn based system is awesome. I think I could even use a system that lets me enter turn based mode when I want, without having to alert enemies, and then maybe I'd have a turn, before they notice anything that happend, or if nobody else notices a kill in the turn, it would refrain from triggering enemy deployment and reaction. Or something, but this is already fine, I can work around it.

The characters are wonderful, the items, the skills, the map, the story... all of it is just wonderful. I'll definetley try different playthroughs for sure.

The game has adorable easter eggs and the voice lines are great. The setting is appealing. I also like the story in general, but that is the end of the positive Review.
There is no pause button, meaning you are regularly thrown on a map corner 5 feet away from the enemies with no time to react to put them in the prone position.  The person at the studio who came up with that should be fired because that was the first reason, I would have refunded that shitshow and according to the forums, I am not alone with that opinion!
The AI is a joke! Even if they don’t have any visuals on your team, they can shoot you with 40mm or mortars with absolute precision! Also, even if you have unloaded a complete mag of 7.62 and 5 Grenades into the asshole of your enemy from 2 feet away, he still shoots you in the head after making three backflips and one pirouette! Nothing even missing limbs could affect the precision of these guys.
These rules don't apply to you, and you miss shots from feet away all the time just because you have a damn papercut on your thumb! I also hate it if you try to shoot at someone and the fkn windows with the details get in front of the actual fire buttons!
At a certain point, you can only grief your way through the enemies by leaving most of your team behind and throwing explosives into the dark until no sound can be heard from the other side of the hallway!
So, if “50 shades of grey” and sticking a cactus in your rectum is your cup of tea be my guest and buy that garbage!

1) Similar to JA2, the game spoofs 80s and 90s action movies.  The mercs spout lines that would fit right in to a Stallone or Schwarzenegger film.  They can be a little goofy, which is the point.  

2) There is significant interaction with the overhead map.  While the actual combat takes place withing the individual sectors of the map, there are many activities that are initiated from the map.  The activities include training militia to watch over a sector after you have taken it, patching up your mercs, or repairing your equipment.  All leverage a clock that makes it easy to see when activities will occur or wrap up, and is easy to use.  

3) The combat is carried out on detailed maps of each sector.  In this mode, your merc team alternates turns with enemies, allies, and civilians.  The combat is similar to other turn based games, leveraging a pool of action points to determine how many things a merc can do that turn.  You can move, aim, shoot, treat wounds, throw explosives, or overwatch.  

It was easy to pick up and play, especially since I had played JA AND JA2 so extensively when they were relevant.  I would buy it again.

Controls are wonky and not intuitive. I can't de-select an option (like shoot) by clicking it, but it will instead use it and shoot. Where does it aim when it just shoots? Do I have a lot higher hitchance if I just shoot instead of selecting torso?

PC enemy is cheating. Can run very far AND still shoot at least once. On some hardcore difficulty level I could understand this, but not on normal difficutly.

Enemies almost never drop things. After securing 4 sectors we've gotten 1 pistol of an enemy and 1 pack of ammo. (22 dead enemies)

Will update accordingly after more playtime.

UPDATE 25th July 2023:

Starting Multiplayer Games and Connecting now works fine. BUT there are a bunch of desync problems even if both players have a very good connection. The desycn-resycn thing wouldn't be an issue tho, cause it takes less than a minute to re-sycn. The issue is that for whatever reason the enemy gets gifted a free move after each re-sync. Like you have to end your move, the enemy makes his move and then you need to end your move again because you have no AP. Unless you save all the time, this might force you to restart a whole battle if the re-sync happens in a precarious moment.

Apart from that the incompetency of our mercenaries is extremely frustrating. The amount of shots missed at short to even point blank range, even with 90+ Marksmanship is a joke. In some cases a merc with 90+ MRK and 90+ DEX will miss a shot on an enemy who is crouched RIGHT BESIDE HIM - a situation where the barrel of his gun is literally touching the enemy. You'd think that would be a 1 in 10000 chance mishap, but you'd be wrong. This happens quite a lot.

MODS are saving this game. I have installed 4 mods currently, of which 3 are just more character presets but one is a mod that increases the drop rate to a more realistic version (25% of the drop everthing mod). Now you are not just constantly forced into running after ammo, parts, etc. just because the game only has a 1% drop chance as standard on normal difficulty.

I will still keep my ""can't recommend"" vote at this time, since without mods the game is still very bad in parts of it's design and I can't award the developers for other's work.",1689344075,1690271104,False,33,5,0.412469297647476196,1,True,False,False

And now, with 2 diamond mines I'm even able to hire another squad to help with those 15 enemies in the next section.

A little frustrated by the targeting system. What are the odds of accomplishing that headshot? And why does it sometimes take 3-4 head shots to kill a guy? And why does a marksman like Buns keep missing those easy shots? Seems a waste of money to pay so-called marksmen if they can't hit a target at least half the time...esp. when the enemy seem so well armed and are able to hit my men lying prone behind some rocks. 

And am I supposed to take every section on the map, one by one? Or should I just go for the ports, mines and big towns? Seems every strategy is foiled as conquered sections are quickly retaken by the enemy...so it's hard to keep a sense of accomplishment. But then its in my nature to keep plugging away at making progress to figure this game out, although how I'm gonna make my way over to the Eagles Nest with enough grenades to do the job is a big question.

The mission this time round is to restore a kidnapped president. In many ways, it's very similar in gameplay style to the original (90s) XCOM, or more recently Phoenix Point. For those used to the series, you know what it's about. But is it any good?

On  the good side, you're getting a solid game of its type. It sticks closely to JA2 and does what it needs, and is mostly quite enjoyable. The tactical layer and strategic layer are both pretty good. There some nicely designed maps (if maybe feeling a little small on the tactical) with cover on the main areas, destroyable terrain and so on. You need to secure diamond mines to fund your operation and recruit mercs, and otherwise have plenty of other locations of interest to explore and side quests to do. You've got to manage your ammo as well so you don't run dry, can repair and craft mods for your guns, and generally kit out your mercs with better stuff. You can level up the cheap mercs you start with, but once the money rolls in you can also just let them go and hire for the better ones.

However, there are some significant problems that hopefully might be addressed in patches.

On the tactical map the game is real-time movement, switching to turn-based when a combat triggers. However, astonishingly there's no pause function to give orders in real time, so unless you're doing something very simple, you cannot control your squad adequately. This is likely to lead to huge frustration. Especially when defending, you have restricted and often unhelpful deployment zones which means you must rush your mercs into position with the clumsy system. Defending ends up feeling like a disadvantage.

There are several other flies in the ointment. The weapon balance feels wrong. Something about the way accuracy, the ammo limitations and so on play out, it feels like the best way to play is to give all your team sniper rifles - and maybe a machine gun for some major combats, if you've got the ammo. There's a truly bizarre design choice that burst fire with assault rifles and submachine guns deals half damage per bullet compared to single shot. This feels completely wrong, and a hamfisted attempt to balance the weapons for gameplay. It suggests to me a deeper problem in the mechanics. I'm also not sure the item pick-ups (e.g. gunpowder availability for ammo crafting seems extremely low) is where it should be, either.

So when answering whether it's good, the answer is overall yes and it's worth its place in this sort of strategy game.

You can approach most battles in your preferred way, unless the situation forces you to adapt. Don't charge into a stationary MG, don't try to fight crocs with your fists, don't bunch up if there are rocket slingers or mortar units etc.

MD even turned into one of my more experienced marksman and always had a good eye on possible flanking spots, from which an enemy might try to approach from.

- It needs pause and a way to queue up simultaneous commands, and press an execute button to have them all go at once, to function better IMO. Example, you pause at the outskirts, then issue commands to move up and go into overwatch from the flanks with your units. Now, when you are spotted after some time (too quick to do this real time without frustration) you will actually have a successful ambush that still feels real.

[b] My Summary: [/b]

A fun-to-play Tactical turn-based RPG, this game offers a lot of room to shoot, scheme and spend ridiculous amounts of money on woefully inadequate mercs whose one-liners are more dangerous than their gun-handing skills.
Each merc has a unique skillset and bio, and their unique (FULLY-VOICED!!!!) interactions with the world, combat scenarios and quest NPCs are quite fun and lighthearted. 

The game features an interesting ammo management system which in Co-op mode is a fun addition to planning, but if you don't have anyone to fight with over the last 7.62mm NATO Armor-penetrating cookie, it loses its charm a little bit. Similarly weapon modification is another avenue to fight over scarce resources. 

Combat is engaging and it feels like good positioning and a solid plan overpower the luck based shot system (also if you've been praying for point blank range providing 100% accuracy, you need to pray harder next time I guess - your merc's hands will often break in the most hilarious ways so that they miss the enemy that's close enough to give them a lil peck on the cheek).

The meta-game [spoiler] (traveling, money management, garrisons, merc hiring, operations) [/spoiler] can be fun, if you take the time to learn all the options that you're presented with, but the fact that there's minimal hand-holding in the game means that you're thrown into the fray head-first. You'll have to discover many menus and functions on your own which is a refreshing departure from the babying we've seen in other genres, but it can also take some time to get a hang of.  It's a bit hard to differentiate between hints, menu information and other elements so sometimes you just go into ""ah, a wall of text"" mode and zone out. 



[b] Strongest Points [/b]

The gameplay is fun, the environment and characters feel alive, a solid plan makes a big difference. There's multiple ways to interact with the world.



[b] Weakest Points [/b]

There's a steep learning curve in the beginning, some minor issues in stability in Co-Op, and the menus, hints and explanations are a bit monochrome.

The main reason is a number of simplifications compared to JA2 and some controversial design decisions. I would like to point out - in my opinion - two most important flaws that ruined the experience for me (hence the thumb down):

- The game is completely unbalanced. Some say it's hard, others say it's easy. Interestingly, both groups are right. It's easy for those who exploit unbalanced mechanisms, hard for those who don't. I finished the game on the hardest difficulty (ie “Mission Impossible”, “Dead is Dead”, “To The Bitter End”, “Lethal Weapons” and no “Forgiving Mode”) without much of a challenge! The game promised that I would suffer, and it was true. I just didn't expect to suffer from boredom:) All it took was 3 snipers (at least one with m24+silencer, ideally Shadow because he can run in stealth mode) and that's it. If you want to make it even easier, you can exploit machine guns + overwatch, but it's not necessary. Paradoxically, the beginning of the game (before you get to the sniper rifles) was the biggest challenge for me while the last sectors (including main bosses) were the easiest.
- AI is terrible. The vast majority of enemies just rush at you mindlessly and since they cannot be disabled in any way (!) (there is no energy bar like in JA2, injuries do not limit them [you can only apply minor and useless debuffs for one turn with arms/legs shots], grenades do not knock them down etc.), it's all about who runs out of HP first (hate this design choice). Btw that's why stealthy snipers are so OP, because they can reliably kill in one shot most of the time (headshots) and thus eliminating the need to somehow disable enemies. Moreover, snipers don't need many bullets and you can use sniper rifles even in CQC (when enemies get close to you). Actually, it is a better option than for example assault rifle burst mode, because the devs have unrealistically reduced total damage output of burst/auto fire for balancing purposes.

As for other shortcomings, they are covered in other reviews. The list is pretty long but I would like to point out, that these shortcomings are not totally gamebreaking (at least for me), unlike the two mentioned above. Some examples follow:
- Little emphasis on realism. I have already touched this point above when criticizing the impossibility of disabling enemies or reduced burst damage output, but that is just a tip of an iceberg. I've been listening to devblogs, so I understand some of the devs' decisions, but I don't agree with them (eg having to choose whether to wear a helmet or a gas mask, when in reality it's fine to have both at the same time). I do think that devs should have leaned more towards realism and balance the game (or create challenges) in other ways (this way of balancing obviously doesn't work anyway).
- Controversial UI. JA is primarilly an isometric tactical turn based combat simulation. Players need to focus on tactics in order to succeed. So why can't I turn off the stupid action cam completely? Why do I have to click on images of enemy body/head/arms/legs in consoleish interface every time I aim/shoot? This stuff is unnecessary and I would even say damaging - e.g. forced action cam creates chaos and distracts you (plus is not appealing, so to say).
- Many important combat features are simplified or missing. You cannot choose if your merc's gonna look to the right or to the left (they are rotating automatically based on enemy's position without spending APs), you cannot use camo kit, you cannot walk backwards (retreating while keeping eyes on enemies), you cannot use extended ear to estimate enemy presence in a building from outside etc. etc. All these features were part of JA2 (vanilla!) and that is imo, what made the game unique and successful. 
- Few types of weapons and equipment (basically, ""tons of guns"" option from JA2 is missing). In addition, you get access to rifles/assault rifles (ak47) right from the beginning (first or second sector) which is a shame, because there is no reason to linger over revolvers, etc. There is no option to buy equipment online (Bobby Ray). Important and interesting equipment is missing (radio, extended ear, camo kit etc.).
- Small maps with very limited approach trajectories. Maps are handmade and devs had a clear idea on how you should proceed and it is so glaring, that you really need to force yourself to pick a different approach when replaying.
- The devs probably wanted to strengthen the RPG element of the game with a series of quests, but by doing that they lined up the progression through the entire game, which I think was a mistake (although admittedly most quests can be ignored, which is a good thing). Moreover, when you deviate from this path, the quest system may start to fall apart (happened to me). I understand it's hard to predict and cover all combinations of players' behaviour in this regard but it's JA, a tactical TBS... quests should not be the main concern here, tactical combat should be. IMHO, time should have been allocated to tactical combat features, realism and balancing instead of quests. JA can't compete in this regard with hardcore RPGs like BG3 anyway; its strengh should be realistic tactical combat because that's what the franchise was originally about + more importantly, there is no serious competition in this field.
- Some characters are extremely annoying or cringy. I understand that the devs wanted to create interesting and memorable characters, but sometines it got totally out of hand imo (for example Deedee). In addition, someone mentioned in their review merc flanderization which I agree with.
...

The list could go on and on, but hopefuly you get the idea from examples above (see other reviews for more). If you are a casual gamer (and new to the franchise), JA3 might be a good game for you (I am focused on shortcomings in this review, but JA3 has also many positive aspects - from nice graphics to interesting and sometimes funny merc interactions; I also appreciate incorporating serious issues like human rights violations/war crimes). However, if you are looking for a real challenge and complex, realistic tactical turn-based strategy or simply something like JA2, I cannot recommend the game in its current state. Wait for mods. Hopefully, the game will get love from die hard fans who do not have to make trade-offs in order to appeal to masses. (This is not a criticism of the devs, I totally get what they did and why. Commercial success is a must and I am glad the game seems to be an overall sucess so far. I am just sad that after all these years we still don't have a worthy successor to JA2, not to mention 1.13 mod).",1690200744,1690200744,False,155,10,0.734130978584289551,41,True,False,False

I have yet to dig deep into game mechanics but I don't see any serious issues so far. Combat is smooth and allows you to be very creative with all the weird kills. I still hope to see rooftops falling down animations.

There are some minor navigation issues and quirk that I think can be improved with QOL updates. Graphics feel a bit heavy on my PC though, and it also looks like the controls might have been thought for the console first when designing. I'm ok with that, but would like a bit more options for PC.

- large enough map featuring enough points of interest
- modern iteration of the beloved franchise

- [spoiler] zombies [/spoiler]
- nice Africa setting, reminds me of Far cry 2

Cons:
- ammo is way too rare; LMG and even AR are hard to feed; sniper team is mandatory to be efficient...
- no store ??!! what s the point of having so much guns if i only find ak47 ,mg42 and m24 ?
- no visual change when you equip armor ; weird even BiA had it

My biggest problem with the game is there's no hit chance with shots, so I'm going in blindly shooting shots that have no chance to land, and over aiming shots that are guaranteed to hit, and the only thing you have to guide you is some vague hits of +++ and --- that tell you there are some positive or negative chances of hitting, but they don't tell you really how good the chances really are. This makes combat extremely frustrating and unfair as the AI certainly know what their chances really are. Thankfully, the community has already come up with two mods that change this. One just directly tells you the percentage chance to hit, which I love. The other, is more vague, but tells you like 'good chance to hit, 'nearly impossible to hit' etc. This aligns a lot more with I think the devs wanted. Their excuse of they want chaos in the battlefield really doesn't hold up in the rest of the gameplay that show numbers. Stats, money, time, resources, etc. Those are all numbers, so why is the most important number being hidden? It makes no sense.

Now with your chance to hit mod and combat not being absolutely frustrating, you can enjoy your game. I've never really played much Jagged Alliance before, and I'm surprised at how fresh a lot of it feels. You can control multiple squads in the world map and have them move back and forth doing quests and carrying loot between each other. Plus, the enemies regularly launch attacks on strategic locations that you can intercept. The world feels absolutely alive as compared to similar games that feel like the world stops when you, the player, are not doing anything. The quests are interesting and fun and there are plenty of goofy, fun references. This is not a game that takes itself seriously, but I'm glad it doesn't go too far with it and go overboard. There are serious missions and serious moments in the game, which makes for an overall emotional experience as you get so much custom dialogue depending on who is in your squad. Your squad makes different quips and remarks to every quest dialogue and makes them feel very real. Knowing that I would get very different dialogue lines with a different squad, makes my squad choice feel so unique. 
The mercs themselves are charming.
However, in the end, I'm left with craving just a little bit more.
A little bit more map, a little bit more choice of mercs, a shopping / selling system.
I would love additional voice lines as they quickly get very repetitive, especially if you stick to the same mercs most of the game.
Ammo is definitely a challenge in the early game as you're relying on RNG to give you some ammo, but it also forces you to be smart in choosing what guns to bring to the fight. There's no reason to use a weaker gun when you have all the ammo you need right? This game smartly gives you as much ammo as you want for weaker guns and rarely for the stronger guns, and I understand the overall lack of ammo can turn people off, and having a shop to make that option available would make the game better. I'm also constantly forever lacking meds and I just accepted I'll go into fights with my injured squad until I bring them to a hospital.

Oh, the overall story is actually pretty good, predictable, but that's what they're going for and it keeps things interesting enough.

Some of the differences that are nagging at the back of my mind when I play JA3 ...

•	Combat maps are graphically nice, but smaller ... which in most cases leads to less tactical setup and battles.
•	You can only attack with one squad ... not like in JA2 where you could coordinate different squads to attack the same sector from different directions.
•	Battles are smaller, as in less enemies to fight against on a map.
•	Combat stamina is gone ... no more shooting armoured enemies with shotguns and such till they go down unconscious for a few turns and no water bottles.
•	No real time pause for setting up your squads first attacks.
•	Crowbars cannot be used as a weapon ... Doh!!
•	You can only train 8 troops to guard your cities, bases, mines etc. ... not the 20 you could in JA2.
•	Dead bodies don’t rot and get eaten by crows ... they just disappear.
•	Less types of guns.
•	JA3 lacks the charm of a JA2 ... no “Elliot you idiot” style cut scenes when you take an important zone ... so far the enemy leader is boring and reading emails about your victories is boring too! 
•	Not found any aliens yet ... maybe there aren’t any!
•       No Bobby Ray's for your online shopping needs ... in fact shopping in game basically does not exist.
•	You can only hire from A.I.M. no other cheaper alternatives like M.E.R.C.

So summing up, it is an ok game, but not ground-breaking and it lacks the charm, humour, scale and details that made JA2 the legendary game it is.",1690160136,1690161294,False,2,0,0.474320113658905029,0,True,False,False

Edit: After 60 hours.. even better. Get it. Game slaps harder than my dad when he starts drinking.

----Atmosphere---
The game nailed the charme, humor and feel of the old JA2. That's great. The game is full of memes, funny pop culture references and i haven't seen 10% of the game after 34 hours played.

---Visuals&Sound---
Don't expect cutting edge graphics. The game looks pretty, but it feels quite dated. Textures are a bit grainy, models are low-poly and animations are a bit janky. But honestly.. it's all good enough so it wont bother you. Sounddesign on the other hand is solid. Even the UI is good enough (which is a rarity in a world where everything gets ported to consoles) and looks beautifully Windows 95. It truly nails the aesthetic of the predecessors and the time it's set.

---Gameplay---
Leveldesign is solid. The gameplay-loop feels satisfying, a bit chaotic and random at times (expect to save and load a lot), but that is part of the charme of this franchise. If you want everything to be predictable this game is not for you. Unless you mod it. Did i say this game has mod support? That basically means this thing will not get old for a looooong time. And that's not even needed as the base game in itself offers easily a few hundred hours of gameplay and fun. So yeah.. it's solid, it's fun and it lasts.

---Poops---
The enemies feel a bit unrealistic sometimes. I can oneshot a guy with a butter knife. Then again i can blow up a dude with a kilo of C4 and he is ""slightly wounded"". Bosses can be a bit bulletspongy. The learning curve is a bit steep. If you miss a few details (like pressing alt to see possible interactions) or that you can create your own merc.. you will probably restart when you find out and trash your existing campaign. But in this day and age i'm all for a game that doesn't hold your hand through every god damn phase of the game. If you don't read and experiment.. your loss.

---Golden Stars---
Did i mention that this game has no loot boxes? No day-1 DLC? No season pass? No cosmetics, no skins, no in-game shop, no in-game currency, no daily quests, no pay to win mechanics, no advertisments, no requests to like and follow it on social media, no launcher, no account you need to create... NOTHING.
The game is simply.. a game. Designed to offer you a good time. No strings attached. No extra bullshit needed. THIS is what we deserve and what 90% of developers no longer give us. For me personally.. that alone is reason enough to buy the game so developers get rewarded for doing it the right way.",1689891352,1690160683,True,65,8,0.807503461837768555,1,True,False,False

+ The main story is weaved into the ""side quests"" in a really creative way. Once you're past the tutorial, the game pretty much just tells you to go across the country to kill the villain. You're set free in a massive world with a ton of people that need help, and you're always getting information or resources that push you towards that final villain.

+ The side quests are fantastic and the characters involved are really fun. These are not Ubisoft-style checklists, they're reminiscent of games like Fallout which have some of the most interesting quests out there. It's important because as stated before, the main quest IS the side quests. There are also skill checks for dialogue and multiple ways to finish a quest, such as choosing to spare or kill someone.

+ The world really is alive. Liberating towns feels incredible because they go from Legion barracks to friendly city centers with lots of people to talk to. The Legion will muster forces at their outposts and send them to take these towns back so you need to train militias to defend them. If you take out the outpost the attacks will stop, but then other outposts will try to retake that outpost. Diamond mines are a massive source of income for the Legion, and you'll see shipments of diamonds periodically come from the mines that you can intercept. You can take the mines for yourself and have a large passive income. The constant battle for territory is one of my favorite parts about this game.

+ The destruction is awesome and it's also persistent. As you fight to liberate a town things will get blown up, and when the towns become friendly you're constantly reminded of past battles when you revisit them.

+ The game is actually funny and they nail the cheesy humor of the old games. Every mercenary is a goofy caricature, and NPC's are consistently hilarious.

+ Exploration is satisfying and there is a CRAZY amount of diversity. Lots of locales and I really like that the world is just a bunch of towns and compounds strung together by a grid. I was very surprised by the amount of unique locations and I'm constantly finding new ones. 

+ Great turn-based combat once you get the hang of it. Much more complex than XCOM, and you really need to play smart to survive. Some of the best guerilla warfare I've seen in a game.

+ Deep inventory system and a good amount of weapon modifications. This is a game for people that enjoy keeping track of every single bullet and grenade they have.

+/- It's a pretty tough game even on normal difficulty. I usually go for ironman in games like this but it really doesn't seem worth it here. Save-scumming sometimes feels necessary.

- You have to get past some jank to enjoy the game. Animations are pretty awful, the camera seems to always want to go to the wrong level when you're in a building, and the game just doesn't run that well. These don't hinder my enjoyment of the game whatsoever, but don't expect a super polished experience.

- While stealth is fun (and important) it's definitely a pain. Combat is turn-based but stealth all happens in real-time and just doesn't feel right most of the time. I believe in the old Jagged Alliance games you could turn on turn-based mode whenever you wanted, which is something that would elevate this game in a huge way",1690158081,1690158081,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Upsides: Just read the positive reviews. I can't disagree with the plus points except where I do below...

Downsides: 
- Performance is pretty poor, with framerates dropping the more enemies you have on the map. I've turned the graphics down to minimum (GTX 2070) and find things get a lot better.
- The realtime element doesn't work for me as a purely TBS player. I like to strategise & think out my moves. I just can't get the stealth mechanic to be anything other than a liability to me. I watch YouTube videos of people doing it, and just can't get my fingers to work like that. 
- I'm not a fan of the ""optimal strategy"" game where there is a ""best"" way of doing things. Machine Guns absolutely chew through enemies if you set up right. Stealth sniping is about the only thing I can do on the RTS side, and it just feels like cheating. ""Do this and profit"". Not for me.
- So far, every sector has been a simple ""clear the map"" sector. It got very boring for me very quickly. Maybe I haven't got to the interesting missions yet, but my incentive to play has just stopped. The game almost feels like a cash grab. 'All tip, and no iceberg'. Very pretty to look at but not very deep. the voice acting & lines are great... The first time. After a while, you just want people to shut up. The environments look really good, but it's really hard to see the map tactically. The UI is great, but badly explained. All just little niggles that make each battle a... well... battle.
- The AI is monstrous. I have no clue where they get all their Action Points from, but they'll happily run across the map and shoot you in the face. They'll suicide move to negate your cover with a hive mind mentality rather than behaving like sensible thinking beings. As for RNG hate, it's less that, and more a lack of transparency as to what these super-soldiers have in the way of skills. 
- The operations aspect is badly explained and juggling the different activities is awkward and unwieldy. This is multiplied when you get more squads - and the whole multiple squads thing just doubles the amount of tedious ""defeat all"" battles, inventory management, and contract renewals.

Of course, mods make the game better, but it feels like many of the top rated mods should really have been in the game to begin with as design decisions. Instead of being enjoyably difficult, the base game is tedious and awkward. The problem is that I didn't discover it until a few hours in.

I think the game is probably worth half its £40 price tag. Replayabilty is quite poor as there really only appears to be one way to do this game, so doing it again will only really be viable with new mods. Even new mercs don't make a huge difference.

Also great it has mod support so features and moe gameplay can be added to it over time.
I like they kept most of the merc relationships from earlier games, but it would've been nice to see more new mercs, they did a great job with most of em, like Fauda, Livewire, Kalyna etc.

The gameplay balance needs a little fine tuning, making smgs and assault rifles as well as handguns more viable would be a nice start. atm, rifles and machineguns kinda rule supreme.

Theres some bugs like the game doesnt always understand what you want, its often made me walk over a landmine rather than do the disarm action on it. other times its worked fine. its very inconsistent.

Some of the boss enemies cannot be shot at all. you will have a 0% chance to hit them and need to use explosives to take them out.

The enemy patrols spawn really rather fast towards the end, i had patrols coming out of an outpost every 12 hours at one point, could barely keep up training militia.

The AI in the game needs work. Sometimes its great, sometimes they just stand and refuse to move, even when you shoot them. I also wish the AI took some consideration to friendly fire, i had a merc die from an elite milita who decided to unload their machinegun into the enemy going thru my merc. Only death too -_-

I liked the little mysteries you find here and there. I did kinda miss the crepitus from JA2 something similar could've been fun.

First, to get it out of the way: it retains much of the old JA games but it also borrows from modern day XCOM. If you're looking for a remaster of JA2, this ain't it. The game also focuses more on the story and quests and there is a lot more interaction between the mercs.

Offering an eclectic mix of tactical and RPG elements, it was able to carve up a modest following and start its own franchise. It was the second numbered game in the series though, Jagged Alliance 2, that made it a household name among gamers of that generation. Rightly so, it was nothing short of one of the greatest games ever made and is a perennial personal favourite. It also proved a tough act to follow. Throughout the years since, various companies came to own the rights to the franchise and several spin-offs were released ranging in quality from passable to abysmal. For the longest time it seemed like the series was just wasting away in limbo. Until about a week ago, at long last, a full 24 years since the previous numbered sequel, Jagged Alliance 3 came to be. Let's see if it manages to live up to its fabled predecessor and breathe new life to this venerable franchise.

The premise will be quite familiar to veterans of the series. The country of Grand Chien, a small African ex-French colony rich in diamonds, is in turmoil. A mysterious warlord known simply as ""the Major"" has kidnapped its president and a civil war is looming. The president's daughter, aided by a corporation interested in the diamond mines, hires AIM, the renowned mercenary company, to help restore order. The player is tasked with picking and leading a group of those AIM mercs in a guerilla campaign to rescue the president and topple the Major. In the true spirit of the series, the player will have to manage the finances of the campaign, navigate the strategic map to capture cities and most importantly mines in order to bankroll the expedition, as well as lead the mercs in turn-based tactical combat and through RPG-lite missions and exploration. Oh and there was no mistake, no, the country is indeed called Big Dog in French. In other words, as is tradition, the game doesn't shy away from humour and satire.

The primary gameplay focus is on tactical combat. That's what most of the game revolves around. In that respect the game is rather reminiscent of the modern XCOM series by Firaxis. I wouldn't say it innovates all that much. The options on offer are certainly more limited when compared to Jagged Alliance 2. The game has fewer weapons and fewer items. It also suffers from a rather obvious lack of balance and finetuning. Several weapon classes like pistols or SMGs have almost no practical use, while LMGs can dominate the battlefield but consume too much precious ammo that can't be easily replaced, all this makes the stealthy sniper approach almost mandatory. Twice so by the endgame when enemies annoyingly get increasingly spongy. Whatever shortcomings there may be though, this is a proven formula and the game does employ it with success. Combat is fun to play and looks good in the process too. It retains a good balance between positioning and engaging with enemies for example, an often problematic element in such games. The highly destructible tactical maps themselves are another highlight, offering excellent verticality and interesting layouts. Few things are as satisfying as firing a rocket at enemies hiding behind a wall and watching as half the building comes crashing down on their heads.

The strategic aspect of the game will also feel quite familiar to returning fans. Its focus is on navigating a map of the region, setting targets for merc squads and managing finances. It's an excellent aspect of the series and it's great to see it return. Some of the new additions like diamond mine shipments that can be ambushed for extra money are more than welcome. Unfortunately though, there are limitations here too. Coordinating attacks between squads for example is very unintuitive. Additionally, the game limits the number of mercs that can be hired at once to merely 15. Why? Does AIM not want my money? That gives the player only 2 full squads of 6 mercs, which further restricts strategic operations. The lack of a proper equipment shop is another palpable omission. And then comes one of the most surprising choices. The diamond mines, all of them, run dry fast. The game does not warn you that this is the case and conceptually it makes no sense. The whole plot revolves around controlling the production of diamonds, yet the moment the player touches them *poof* they go. Sort of like a reverse Midas. This means the game does not allow you to ever form a stable income eliminating a number of previously valid playstyles. I hope the developers realize just how daft this design choice was and at least make it optional in a future patch.

Core gameplay aside, anyone who knows anything about this series will tell you that the heart and soul of Jagged Alliance is the mercs. This lovable, dysfunctional and diverse group of rogues, weirdos, sycophants, action heroes and psychos. Each of them oozed personality. Their relationships with one other, their likes and dislikes, it provided the series with incredible depth. It appears that the developers of this sequel loved those characters and understood their significance also. Certainly there are many mercs missing, but the ones that do return are lovingly recreated. I enjoyed simply staring at their renders from time to time. Even the voices are for the most part great. I had long thought that nothing could ever come close to the voice overs of Jagged Alliance 2, yet those here are not only faithful but absolutely serviceable. Some, perhaps, are even better. This is a veritable cornucopia of fanservice. If I had to nitpick, I'd say it's too much. The mercs can come across as flanderised with their most prominent character features exaggerated. It made me wonder at times if the writers didn't have the chops to develop them properly and had to resort to, admittedly entertaining, fanfic. Either way, that's nitpicking. For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed this aspect of the game.

To conclude, does this sequel truly manage to live up to Jagged Alliance 2? Well, maybe not, but it does get close enough to breathe new life to the franchise. I'd argue it gets closer than anything has so far and close enough to a legend, sounds good enough to me. Indeed, this is a very respectable effort and I certainly recommend it to all fans of the series, but also fans of tactical games and classic RPGs in general. It does lack some polish and it does need to be better balanced in a number of areas, I do hope the developers will not abandon this game but nurture it via patches so that it can fully realise its great potential. With any luck, they will also reintroduce some of the missing mercs at some point. I'm really looking forward to that possibility, even in the form of paid expansions. No matter, the point, folks, is that Jagged Alliance is finally back in action. For real this time. That's reason enough to be content.

JA builds on the legacy of what Sir-Tech did with Wizardry, in that there is some team continuity from Wiz 1 through every JA mainline entry - and so at heart, it understands that there's a bit of dungeon crawling and quest-giving and factional intrigue going on, even if it looks like gunmen and jungle warfare. These games are replayable, and allow you to have some fun with gimmick characters and strategies. This is stuff that many tactics games give no attention to, but it's an important part of feeling immersed in the scenario that is specific to JA. If you really like JA, that's what sets it apart.

It does have a LOT of tactical combat in it, and that part is pretty in-depth, and deserves to be front-and-center. But the campaign isn't a series of combats, it's also dialogue, looting, character progression and other things, and it rewards looking for hints and secrets in every aspect, from browsing the various web sites on your in-game laptop to making sure you have mercs with various different stats and personalities so that they can see and access more loot and talk to NPCs in ways that progress side quests. If you only pay attention to min-maxing combat stats, you can miss quite a bit just in the first few hours.

JA3 is probably the smoothest game yet at surfacing the role-playing without being completely drowned in combat. If you've played the previous games, jumping in at a harder difficulty is fine, provided you allow yourself some save-scumming to learn the nasty surprises. The early game will be tough and a few sectors along the coastline across from your start location will feel outrageous if you try to attack them with a low-level squad. The game penalizes your hit chance heavily for attacking higher-level enemies, and vice-versa, you can stomp lower-level opponents because they will all miss. Later on, especially after you start applying weapons mods, you'll start to have the combat power to overcome just about anything. But the early stages can be really frustrating if you take the wrong fights; not unwinnable, if you have enough explosives and carefully employ melee, but definitely something where you'll reload the game over and over(which it eases because it autosaves every turn for you).

The real-time portion now acts as a kind of minigame to achieve the best position possible before engaging, versus being a tedious ""as soon as enemies are seen, ready or not, you have to go into turn-based"". It's a bit stressful since you feel like you have to rush sometimes if you want the first shot, but it's actually somewhat fair in that ""being noticed"" gives you a window to make one last action, which, if it's a stealth kill, lets you keep going. The new system has the effect of streamlining a lot of the turn-based part into being just the essential moments of contact, and making it non-pausable also hurries things along and limits how much you fiddle around trying to perfectly bamboozle every enemy.

It should be noted that during JA2's development, they considered going to pausable real-time and turned back from it. This is stuff that the developers have had decades to think about - they know that players will aim to break the game even if it becomes tedious to do so, and a lot of the obvious solutions to that make the game more hands-off and less satisfying. The system they went with here keeps the most essential part of the turn-based interface - you get to move every merc, place every shot, allocate every action point - while also being fast, and much less confusing for portraying ambush and surprise: if you end the turn with overwatch, you usually interrupt, the end. And if you want to peek from cover it explicitly models that instead of making it a guessing game about whether you actually get the first shot. In this respect it retains details, but also brings back the fluidity that existed in the first game, where it was fast because the mechanics were simple and you could rely a lot on ""kevlar bushes"" for cover. 

You can accuse it of copying X-Com's mechanics, but it's not really doing the same thing either. You win a fight in JA not by carefully thinking through hit probabilities and always taking the cover advantage, but by already knowing before you even get into position, what the position is meant to accomplish and why that merc will have success there. A lot of the success has to do with the merc's character, their skills/perks, and the weapon they're using and the positions where it has an advantage. For example, the bipod mod gives a large accuracy bonus when prone, and scopes increase the accuracy bonuses for using additional action points to aim. In contrast there are scopes and stock adjustments that let the gun take fewer action points to shoot with, or more accurate on the first shot. And you can learn the enemy types and the weapons they carry, too. So with experience, you can know how a battle will play before you even start turn-based.

Which furthers my main point - the game really wants you to engage with the role-playing and strategy just as much as the tactics. If you play within the intended progression you get easier, faster fights, but a master tactician can also push for harder fights earlier. How JA3 goes about juggling these different design priorities is really interesting and definitely worth your time.",1689666903,1690091554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Without the eye-bleeding caused by those dratted 1990s era graphics :steammocking:

(I played games from that era somewhere in the ~7500 hours ballpark, so I've earned the privilege to eschew the ""visual austerity"" of the age).

Maybe we will even (EVENTUALLY?!?) see a ""Jagged Alliance 2"" reskin in this game/engine?! Even if it is just done by modders THAT would be amazing.

I have not checked in on the ""Bear's Pit"" guys for years now; I assume they are not all dead and were still chugging along modding JA2.1.13 when this was released?

Turn based tactics are a true JA thing in its core. No XCOM style oversimplified, dumbed down things like 2 ACTION move & shoot turns, no chance-to-hit (or rather miss). Combat is based on action points and you are free to spend them as you wish. If your mercs are agile they will have more APs, if they are dextrous and skilled at shooting they will hit their shots etc.

From what I've played — game feels great, except this whole pause thing, so thumbs up for now.

One thing that was really great is characters — each merc comes with own identity, voiceovers, and reacts to npcs/combat situations/story development and sometimes each other differently. And there's plenty of mercs in this game, devs done good job there.

Personally i waited this game for about 20 years, and it lived to its name. I noticed laughing out loud to some jokes in dialogs or references to movies, songs, other games etc. I did most of the side quests and minor stuff, but not all. There was so much things to do. 

I liked the twisted humor from different mercs and NPC, gameplay worked good, got only one game freeze in my 77h play time,  it was real Jagged Alliance experience. 

Only problem what I had in the game, was with the ""action camera"", what you cant turn off from sniper rifle attacks. One reason might by my 21:9 screen, but sometimes you couldnt click to aim other bodyparts than torso. Other than that, game worked like it should.

Two things I did not love is the amount of busy work on the map, which actively stops you from questing and progressing through the game (healing, repearing, training militia after an attack etc.).

You should remember that sequence of events in quests are important. I missed out on a total of 3 missions. 4, if you count the guy I was supposed to save. Your play style is really however you want it to be. A lot of people in the forums say snipers are OP but the reality is that explosives are OP. Snipers are good for going undetected but really stronger and better equipped enemies (or just bad luck) can sometimes get through to you. Get you an explosives expert with mustard gas grenades, gas canister mortars, and an RPG and no enemy will ever come close to you.

I really like the personalities of a lot of the mercs. In my game I hired 19 mercs from rookies to legendary. they each have funny back and forths and unique dialog while in mission. My favorite mercs in this aspect had to have been Hitman and Reaper.

Dont worry too much about money. The game gives you plenty of opportunity to make a ton from mining to raiding. Higher level difficulties will see reduced income but its not too noteworthy. Im currently on a mission impossible run and the only troubles I have are maintaining a good amount of ammo.

Game can be a bit choppy every now and then but I reduced some of my settings and it runs perfectly fine now. I havent experienced any bugs other than not sequencing some of the missions properly which led to me not getting a couple of achievements but that doesn't really take away from the gameplay.

JA3 looks like another alpha version of a game in my opinion. Its alright to play but because industry in a whole is so fucked up there is no way any game can be special and wonderful.

I'm absolutely loving this game. I played the originals when they came out and I feel like JA3 is just what I wanted in a modern day JA game. I think I was hooked when I saw the run and gun action that allowed me to run to cover while firing bursts of submachine gun fire at various enemies and then I did a barrel roll over a box.

I feel like it has just the right amount of complexity and simplicity for me. Every merc has their own unique skill, their own personality, character models, commentary and interactions throughout the game. I like the variety of guns, modding the guns and that each square of the map presents a hand made battle field that is unique, has character and presents a different challenge. Sure, stealth sniping is pretty OP, but it does seem like there are a variety of strategies to choose from and your tactics really matter.

A few things I wish I had known when I started:

1) Morale is really important. It can give you +/- 3 action points which can make a big difference. Mercs that don't get along or decisions that upset characters (such as looting the mass grave on the tutorial island) can have long lasting negative impacts on your characters combat ability. Perks that improve morale can be huge for the team.

2) Wisdom is the most important stat. Finally a game that gets how life really works. If you can learn, you can get better at everything else. Mercs with high wisdom can be trained much faster on every other skill, learn more by doing, find more herbs and pass most skill checks. Wisdom is also the only skill that cannot be trained with the training operation. Mercs with high wisdom can be quickly trained into super soldiers.

3)Similarly, having at least one character with high leadership is important because it affects how fast the trainers can train skills. It also affects many other things like skill checks, how fast you travel and morale changes during events.

4)It is ok to take your time. As far as I can tell from reading comments and my own experience, there are only a couple events that seem to trigger a much harder experience and they can be avoided or interrupted. Otherwise, you just have to deal with outposts launching attacks which can be intercepted, fought off by militia or take out most outposts.

5)Intel and Livewire. Intel on a sector can often reveal very valuable secret stashes you can't get otherwise. Scouting for intel generally seems to result in people getting wounded, but hacking devices can sometimes get you intel on a sector. Livewire has a special ability to not only get extra intel when that happens, but when in a sector with intel, shows you every enemy location. This is possibly the most powerful special ability because of it's multiple benefits to get more loot, spend less time scouting and recovering from wounds and make combat much easier.



I know I was skeptical about a JA remake, but If you are a turn based tactics fan I would say this is definitely a buy in my opinion. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have been.

At first all the things I didnt like sprung to my eye: The Inventory system and the gunplay/firefights that are quite good but lack something I dont know exactly yet. 

But if you give this game a chance, you will certainly come to the conclusion, that it is a good game on its own. The graphics and effects are great, there is a lot of variability, the characters are awesome, sound is well made and a ton of QoL changes that are nice to play with e.g. the Operations system, the scouting, the gun modding. And I looove the urban settings and that it feels like you can now storm a room with granades and tactical gameplay. The different elevation levels were implemented so nicely. It feels great having a sniper on the roof, covering your squad in the streets from abouve. 

For me it also feels like a real JA Game. 

The things that should be improved: The whole Inventory system, Gun mods should be detachable, the gunplay and economy balance (sniper/ar/mp), the overview function and the alert system at the start of a fight.  I would like the firefight gameplay a little more realistic and immersive e.g. more suppressive fire, more shots all around and less hits, smarter enemys that dont just run into your overview, AP Balance that favors smaller guns in CQB more. And it would have been great if more buildings would be accessible in the dense citys. You see, a lot of small things that are maybe possible to change. Nevertheless, its fun as hell and shows in which direction this series could go. 

And at all the haters that are sad that it isn´t JA2: If this game is a success, maybe it will improve the chances for an JA2 1.13 Definitive Edition/Remake. A combination of the good things of JA2 and JA3 would be the perfect JA4 for me. :)",1690050558,1690050558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Love how it kept true to the originals in most cases
+ graphics are pretty good
+ the game is hard 
+ Humour in the game is good if you are a bit older and get all the references
+ Turn based combat is great and a lot of fun

- picking up salvage and other items found can be a pain
- NPC AI is sometimes pretty bad
- Not much experimenting with combining items like in the originals.  ( if this changes ill update)
- When a merc identifies a mine he should immediately stop all actions
- A sort button for inventory would be great/auto stacking
- minor bugs but nothing game breaking

It’s a lot of incessant pandering to Jagged Alliance nostalgia and general nerd culture mixed with attempts at humor that are as cringeworthy as they are incessant. Spoilers ahead:
You can’t play for 10 minutes without a reference to the old games. There’s a drug called Metaviron, of course (it apparently gives you blue eyes because nerd culture). Elliot, the idiotic advisor from JA2, fled to Grand Chien, of course. One of the barkeepers from Arulco is also there, obviously. And so on. This is interspersed with nerdy references Big Bang Theory writers would have been ashamed of. Someone directly quoting Bilbo Baggins when asked to hand over a diamond. There’s a bat signal in the jungle. Ancient African relics and voodoo cults of...Cthulhu? Sure, yes, it’s a nerd thing, gotta have Cthulhu.
The pandering never stops or slows down. And of course there are some shots taken at easy targets...that still mostly miss. There’s an animal rights activist called Petta (GET IT?) because making fun of vegans is surely still the zeitgeist. There’s a Karen. Her name is Karen. She would like to speak to the manager of a refugee camp because being there is worse than when she wanted to vacation in Acapulco and ended up in Arulco. This is extra funny because, you see, there was a tourist couple in JA2 that wanted to go to Aruba and ended up in Arulco and you had to escort them. You recognize these things and we’re pointing at them, won’t you please laugh?
If you like your media to yell “DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR CHILDHOOD!?” at you and want nothing more than being spoonfed regurgitated entertainment, you might like this if you turn your brain off, but it’s awful.
The worst thing, however, is that the mercs you hire have less depth than they did in JA2 while having more lines. Ice, whose character was completely butchered, is almost entirely a gangsta parody and will talk about thug life and badass bitches without end. Mouse’s personality is that she’s a lesbian and mouse-like. Steroid will not shut up about the gym and his biceps. This wears very thin after maybe 5 hours, or roughly 10% of the game.

In terms of gameplay, it takes as much from XCOM as it does from Jagged Alliance 2, and comes with a fun strategic layer and a lot of balancing problems that will hopefully get addressed. There are some weird things about it, like the fact that the game is about a conflict over diamond mines but to force the player’s hand the mines run dry eventually, so, really, at some point everyone could just go home. The endgame is a chore and I didn’t finish the game. All weapon types can be useful in the late game (unlike in JA2, honestly) but crit-fishing from stealth with sniper rifles and/or, if you have the ammo, overwatch creeping are the best and unfortunately also most boring options. But still, the gameplay loop is engaging, it’s mostly that, without the Jagged Alliance name and a decent marketing budget, this game would not really stand out too much. That’s not to say that the gameplay is why I’m leaving a negative review. It’s just not good enough to make up for the horrendous writing.",1689907165,1690046806,False,30,4,0.541073441505432129,6,True,False,False

Set in the fiction west african nation of Grand Chien (french for ""Big Dog), the President of the nation has been kidnapped by a right wing militia called ""The Legion"", led by a mysterious warlord called ""The Major"". Hired by the Presidents daughter and generously bankrolled by a foreign diamond mining corporation with dubious morals, your mission is to rescue the President and bring some long sought peace and stability in the country. 

Thats the basic gist of the story, but its all you need to get started. Whats important is the gameplay. Now, let me get this out of the way immediately: This is NOT a 1:1 recreation of Jagged Alliance 2 and IT IS DEFINITELY NOT IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM A RECREATION JAGGED ALLIANCE 2 WITH THE 1.13 MOD. Ive spent way too much time among people who complain that this game didnt play exactly the modded game. 

Anyways, The game is simple: You control a squad of Mercenaries hired on the Internet in turn-based shoot outs against enemy soldiers. You can move, shoot, change stance, set up overwatch or hunker down, there is an extra ability that depends on the weapon type, a throw equipped grenade ability and finally, some mercenaries have a special ability of their own. Thats all the controls you get and the enemy has most of them too. So ultimately, the question of victory or defeat is answered by the competence of the player. Whether you rush in and get your squad killed, or set up proper overwatches, use copious amounts of grenades and only shoot at targets you know you can hit, it all depends on YOU the player.

Now, one key element of JA3 gameplay is the fact that, as in previous installments, there is no chance to hit shown.  All you can rely on is the quips of your Mercenaries and common sense. I mean, you dont really expect a mercenary with bad marksmanship and a pistol to hit a guy hunkering down behind a stone wall, do you?

Speaking of mercenaries, there is a lot of them: 36 hireable from the internet and 4 recruitable on the map, all of them with their own personalities, likes, dislikes, opinions and quirks. They are all memorable and lovable in their own right. Like for example, The mercenaries Raider and Raven are married, while the merc Hitman tries to hit on Raven when on the same team as her, so Raider hates the guy and refuses to work with him, unless Raven is on the same team. And they even have a conversation where Raider calls out Hitman for being a lecherous perv towards his wife. Its all lovely.

The story isnt anything special, with the main twist probably being seen a mile away, but the fact that the game series are homages to campy B-Movie action flicks, its probably intentional. Nevertheless, its a pretty intriguing story and the search for the identity of The Major is a nice puzzle to figure out.

Of course, the game has its own problems, but the nice thing about them, is that all of them are very subjective, related to game balance and mechanics. There arent problems that are objectively ruining the game.

So all in all, this is FINALLY a proper installment to the series, with its own merits and I with the imminent availability of mod tools, I imagine the game will have a longevity comparable to Jagged Alliance 2",1690044372,1690044372,True,7,0,0.549577295780181885,0,True,False,False

I was initially skeptic about that 90s sense of humor of the mercs pushing me away from the game, but it turned out to be the opposite. It's just the matter of finding the right characters, or simply giving a second chance to those who don't please you right away. Not many games manage to pull that sort of characterization off, especially when there's little to no actual character development. Instead, there's just such a huge number of hilarious and deep interactions, and that you'll be hard pressed to find them all, which is what makes this game great.

The game supports mods and workshop, which is fantastic.
Graphics are great.
Game play is fun.
Weapon modding is good.
The game doesn't pad time with unit movement like some TBS games do.  For instance, enemies move at once, then take their firing turns, same with civies.  The user can switch between units when another unit is moving.
Units have unique perks as well as a skill tree.

[b]Modding[/b]
Quite frankly, not only am I enjoying the game, but i'm really excited about the workshop mod support.  It looks like the modding is pretty complete.  Logic changes, adding models, adding campaigns, item add/change, and creating maps.  As of this writing the modding is not officially released but there is a mod that can enable the existing hidden tools.  As I understand, full modding tools will be released soon.  Modding is Lua through the Haemimont game engine.

[b]Complaints I've seen:[/b]
For some reason, some people are comparing the action system to XCom's 2 move/action type movement, which is not correct.

The game uses AP, which can be used how the user likes.  One move at a time, multiple shots, etc.  The interesting thing is that the character gets ""free movement"" AP's that can be used at the start of their turn and expires when shooting.

When on a map, the game starts in a real time mode until the enemies spot the team.  Either through a stealth/spot failure, the team attacking a unit, etc.  The complaint is that there is no way to pause this mode.  However, there is currently a mod that adds this.

When shooting, there is no chance to hit shown at all.  The devs say this is a game design and balance choice.  There is a mod for that as well.  One mod shows the CTH in percentage and another gives a general description (unlikely, average, etc.)  The latter mod also has several options to tailor it further.

I have played and enjoyed it many times and have played every mod and just about every misbegotten attempt at a remake ever since.  I desperately wanted to like JA3 as I thought from the screenshots that we were finally going to get a worthy follow up to JA2.  I was wrong.

JA3 might be a goodish game for some people, but no way does it follow in the footsteps of JA2.  In fact the developers have managed to take a set of good idea and mess most of them up.

Lets start with the characters.  Yes, they have got some decent voice acting but the characters, supposedly brought in from JA2, are the same names but very different characters.  These characters are dumbed down, single dimensional versions of the originals.  Steroid is now utterly obsessed with his physique to the exclusion of all else.  Buns, who was always a bit prim and proper with a proud assessment of her own abilities, is now a raving narcisstist.   What makes this worse is that all the characters have ""funny"" lines that they say to illustrate their single dimension personalities, and they say these over and over and over again.  Every time you select a merc, you get the same ""funny"" line that you got last time, and the time before, and the time before that.  It becomes very annoying.  Couldn't they just say ""yes"" or ""OK"" once in a while, or better still just shut up?

The tactical maps are small, with lots of no-go areas which make the usable area even smaller.   Compared to the isometric layout of JA2 they give much less scope for tactical movement.  In fact I get the feeling that the tactical maps have been designed with a correct way to win built into them.  I played one sector where there were only three movement channels to come up to where the bad guys were.  I had to save and reload fifteen times as my mercs were getting trashed no matter what moves I tried on two of the routes and even combinations of them.   I then tried the third route and won the sector easily without any of my mercs even getting wounded.

The JA3 interface is also pretty awful.  Part of the beauty of JA2 was the interface design.  On a single screen you had the tactical map, and along the bottom portraits of your squad showing health, energy, morale and loadout for each of them.  Right click on a portrait and you could also see what the merc was carrying.  JA3 by comparison is a clunky mess with loads of superfluous information thrown at you all the time.  Even when you take a shot, you can't just put your target reticule on a bad guy and shoot.  No, a pop-up information screen appears with a schematic layout, showing that the head is above the torso, and the things hanging down from the torso are legs, and the bit above the legs is the groin, etc.  It really ruins immersion.  (Actually, I already knew that the bit above the torso was the head, but don't tell the devs).   And for all the information panels that are thrown up to clutter the screen, it's still sometimes not easy to judge the status of your mercs.  A merc can show normal energy levels (once you have clicked on the side panel to see this along with a ton and a half of other info), then an hour or two later be flagged a tired and in need of sleep.  At this point, it's no use giving them a couple of hours nap, you are required to give them a full 12 twelve hours break!  Who designed that?

Apart from the cardboard cutout characters, and the cluttered interface, and the restricted and uneven battles, the biggest thing I dislike about JA3 is the lack of freedom.  The greatest thing about the gameplay in JA2 was that you were given a simple objective - overthrow Deidranna.   How you did it was up to you.  That's what made it a great game and massively replayable.  JA3 is much more directive in what you MUST do next -- liberate that village, get boat to mainland, find the Major etc, etc.  Oh, and to find the major you have to talk to the Pierre character on the island.    I don't want to talk to Pierre, just because I'm told I MUST.  I tried killing him every which way to avoid talking to him, but it's impossible to kill him.. You MUST talk to him.  Then you MUST do this and you MUST do that.  This is nothing like Jagged Alliance.  Jagged Alliance was always about you writing your own story, not being driven along by the story somebody else wrote.

If you want an X-Com2 like game, this is OK.  But if you are looking for an improvement on Jagged Alliance 2, this isn't it.   It is probably the best of a bad lot of JA2 follow-ups, but it's still an opportunity missed.

Graphics are good but FPS aren't great and the settings needed some tweaking for me to run well, but it doesn't matter much in this type of game.

Notable things after some more hours after initial review:
- No hit chances, but after >10 hours it is obvious that you don't need them too much, because most of the time you can guess when it hits
- Weapon balancing is a the major issue for me. Long range rifles, especially suppressed is basically objectively more useful than any other weapon by far. Assault rifles are usable but deal maybe 10-30% of damage compared to sniper rifles. SMGs are basically useless. Whereas a rifle can easily deal 50-100 (crit) damage, they consistently do a tenth of that, making them completely useless. 
A bullet is a bullet, I had hoped the main difference is accuracy, range, but as of now one weapon type is clearly superior to everything else with nearly no downside.
- You can train militia but not move them, much more micromanagement is necessary to protect the sectors.
- The story elements and side quests are fun, numerous and fit in very well
- Mines can run out on random chance, some players didn't even get a return on investment (training militia).

You'll recognize a lot of concepts and mechanics from JA2 which is pretty good compared to most of the other successors but one thing I really cannot understand is why until now nobody is/was able to produce a worthy successor of JA2 or at least something that feels like a step forward in it's development.
THQ surely did not succeed with this one.

So what's good about JA3:
- you'll recognize a lot of features from JA2
- it has the really good concept of real time vs turn based which was rather unique at the time
- actions points (!!!) not just 2 actions per turn like x-com
- different outcomes every time you take a shot
- nice graphics but compared to the current standard they are 7/10 at best, a bit better as is was with JA2
- the modding feature is nice and even a bit more sophisticated 
-  it's nice to see the old mercs from JA2 back in action
- stupid militia forces hiding cowardly in the back! 
- create your own merc but with a not so funny P.E.T. test and even fewer avatars (really, THQ?)
- nice voice acting and some fine humor as well as references to JA2
- nice try of implementing stealth tactics but not as well as in JA2

so, what's not so good?
- UGH those maps - even though nice to look at - are... sooo... terribly.... small... tiny at best... feels like Jagged Alliance Online which was one if not even the worst spin off so far
- the main map is also way too small. Arulco was not big but compared to that... Compare the 60 sectors of JA1 with Arulco and you're at JA3
- did I mention that the maps are way too small and that this game feels more like an arcade-ish mobile light version of JA2?
- the maps are so terribly small that no match I have encountered so far comes even half way close to the glorious sector battles in JA2. this is really really really really awful!!!!! 
- one of the main reasons why JA2 was such a success - at least for me - was the huge amount of freedom you had which now gets squeezed into a 10x10 inch square... try to unfold guerilla tactics there, you'll see what I mean. 
- another thing that is pretty annoying is enemy behavior as soon as you are detected. first of all they get a reposition phase, which could be acceptable, but considering the size of maps, this means you'll almost immediately get swarmed as your opponents have that much AP to cross the map in two turns whereas you have to choose between shooting or running into new cover which is futile considering the small maps opposed to the number of enemies within 
- but even that could be acceptable but not when you consider how small the world map is and how soon you are going to be facing heavy opposition from superior enemies that outnumber you up to 4:1
- then, when you try to split them up and your sniper is on one side of the map and kills the first enemy, your opponents magically seem to know that the rest of your team is hiding on the other side of the map and start running towards them and attacking them too. 
- another thing is cover. why is it in there? the enemy does not seem to care, your militia forces as well and it also does not weigh into account when calculation to-hit probabilities seeing how my mercs get hit from no matter what distance even behind deep cover where as my opponents hide in open sight and I cannot hit them or deal serious damage
- then again the weight of effect of small maps.... enemies literally 4 tiles away from your mercs after 2 turns and you still only get 1 hit on him out of a burst. 
- there is a mod that shows to-hit-probabilities. assuming that it's calculations are correct you'll get an awful lot misses with 87% or higher hit chances, even from ""just"" 4 tiles away.
- I'm really sorry to say but the longer I play JA3 the more I get reminded of Jagged Alliance Online but without it's pay-to-win options
- as opposed to small maps at least balancing problems can be patched


it's simply not enough to produce a light copy of JA2, which this game really is, modernize it, call it Jagged Alliance 3 and expect to create a game that can stand on it's own. 
THQ, you said it yourself: there were many tries that were... interesting....
 
I guess one should just leave it with that and come to terms with the fact, that the so called good ol' days are finally over and you were one of the few lucky bastards to have lived in them and that, even a quarter of a century later, you'll cannot expect to come across of a decent successor.


EDIT after a few more hours into this game:
- it's getting even more ridiculous... opponents do have a much larger AP pool which you can infer from the distance they can cover with just one regular turn while still being able to shot afterwards, mind you! 
- my guess is they need this to compensate for their poorly scripted behavior, but it does not stop here...
- now add to their base distance they can cover the one from their repositioning phase, their godlike ability to infer where your exact location is even though you're hidden and use silenced weapons, so you don't get surprised that they literally move right up to your position while simultaneously nullifying your camouflaged status. 
- remember: all this in only 1 turn! 
- now ask yourself: to what kind of tactical solution will such a mechanic lead to? right, kill every enemy with one shot, otherwise you get slaughtered. why? because you're obviously lacking 50% of your opponents action points so you'll have to choose whether to shoot or run and because the maps are too god dammed small! 
- please be ware: I am not complaining about game difficulty here
- but ask yourself: what were the guys at THQ thinking of when implementing such mechanics? this has nothing to do with tactics, this is merely massacre on a half-hourly basis.
- this is exactly what is wrong with e.g. Jagged Alliance Online or X-Com. I cannot fathom the degree of shortsightedness when implementing such a game crippling mechanic. why even think of different approaches when right after first contact you'll get swarmed with suicide drones? 
- why even bother boasting to work with the original developer from JA2 while ignoring everything that made JA2 a superb game in the first place? why even bother trying to copy JA2 or claiming to create a successor? why even naming it ""Jagged Alliance""? is it hubris or hypocrisy? 

so I am really and honestly afraid that even after more hours experiencing JA3 I cannot come to another conclusion other than that:

Some games leave an indelible mark on our gaming hearts. Jagged Alliance and Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games were undoubtedly those kinds of games for me. Jagged Alliance 3 successfully rekindles those fond memories and carves out its unique space in the landscape of tactical RPGs.
The humour, as dry as the Mojave, is back with a vengeance, taking me on a nostalgic trip back to the franchise's glory days. It's not just about the laughs, though; the gameplay is where JA3 truly shines. It's compelling and rewarding, a true homage to the tactical finesse of the originals. It also pays homage to the old-school Fallout games, integrating a gunplay system that feels as satisfying as unloading a minigun in V.A.T.S.
While the story may not be worthy of a Pulitzer, it's serviceable and keeps the narrative moving. But let's be honest, we're not here just for the narrative; we're here for the tactical skirmishes and the snappy, witty dialogue exchanged between our ragtag group of mercenaries. And, on these fronts, JA3 delivers a knock-out punch.
Although Jagged Alliance 3 shares similar gameplay elements with the Xcom series and Wastelands 2 and 3, it confidently strides forward on its own without leaning too heavily on its inspirations. In fact, I'd go as far as to say JA3 stands proudly on its own jagged legs, proving itself to be a more than worthy sequel to the series.
Now, there's a looming shadow on the horizon. The imminent release of Baldur's Gate 3, JA3, might be somewhat overshadowed. However, I truly believe that Jagged Alliance 3 is a gem that deserves to be discovered and cherished, despite whatever gaming titans might be vying for the spotlight.
In summary, Jagged Alliance 3 is a fantastic game, and it would be a shame if it got lost in the shuffle. So, tactical RPG fans, do yourselves a favour: Give JA3 the attention it greatly deserves. You won't be disappointed.

Drassen and Alma respectively, but I can fully understand why most dedicated of fans would be disappointed with Jagged Alliance 3 as it's not as in-depth as its predecessor.

But at the same time... take off those rose tinted vintage glasses. This game is not as bad as they make it out to be and should be taken with a grain of salt as it is pure exaggeration. Buy this game and make up your own opinion on it. I'll give some reasons why you should buy it, while also having some JA2 knowledge in mind.

- Maps are smaller compared to JA2. Yeah, I can understand the gripe there. Not as much freedom to do the mission how you want to. But this also has its own benefit too. Missions take shorter amounts of turns to complete and honestly, that's a plus in my books as I find fights to take way too long in JA2. Fights can last up to half an hour or more at minimum on JA2. Here, 30 minutes is what I'd dare call the bare maximum. Not to mention the game map is huge, so you won't run out of sectors to fight in very soon to begin with anyway.

- Most of the core gameplay is more streamlined. AKA, strategic map operations (I.e. managing militia, treating mercs, repairing items), stealth which is not as risky compared to JA2 and combat is juuuuust slightly more forgiving, and not to mention much easier to learn. Compared to JA2, there was a lot more to take into account. Things like how long a weapon took to ready before firing which equaled to more APs spent, how much aiming ticks a weapon could use, is it within its effective range, how much does it kick after each shot, there were so many factors to keep track of. Sure a few hours or days of playing the game would let you get used to JA2, but it still would turn most newbies away. Here in JA3, this is a good introductory game to the series. It still keeps most of these mechanics, while only getting rid or tweaking a few others so it doesn't effect Jagged Alliance's gameplay is at its core. It still plays like Jagged Alliance, just without needing to read a bible passage long manual.

- Final point here is, unlike most of the bad Jagged Alliance games we got in the past, you can finally make your own custom merc and play to your liking. For people who complain how the game is super easy if you play as a stealthy sniper, I got a very shocking answer to your problem... ""just...don't play as a stealthy sniper."" Seriously, it is not that hard to just ""not"" play it that way. If you don't like how the game is too easy, then put some restrictions on yourself. It's what every gamer does, and it's evident on certain videos like for example, in the Yakuza games where they stop using the ""Tiger Drop"". It is not hard to restrain yourself from doing something you don't like, and you have full control to deal with it. Moderation is not just exclusive to alcohol and drug use.

Overall, the game is a fantastic addition to the series, and I say this with basic knowledge of JA2, as well as looking back at the god awful renditions like ""Jagged Alliance: Back in Action"" or ""Jagged Alliance: Rage"". Jagged Alliance Online was actually okay. But anyway, this is most certainly ""THE"" true sequel to Jagged Alliance 2 that we all needed and dare I say, deserved? 

You still not convinced enough? Well guess what? Why don't you make it that way then? Jagged Alliance 3 is also very moddable, so if it is not the JA2 experience you wanted, then either show us you got the male genitalia and show all of us what really is a ""true"" Jagged Alliance 2 sequel in your book, by making your very own mod that addresses your issues, or wait like every sane, and normal patient person for said mod(s) to appear. If you refunded the game, well tough luck. Good things come to those who wait, and you didn't. 

You're free to bash my opinion in the comments, but just remember, it's just an opinion. Saying it's a bad opinion, is still your opinion regardless, sorry to burst your bubble.

Some things have changed like:
How you initiate a combat particularly how you initiate the melee assassination can be ... confusing at first until you get used to it unless if you had experience with some other real time tactical game that used similar mechanic.

And not all the mercenaries are replicated quite like how they were in Jagged Alliance 2, Fox for example have... changed a bit.

How you get new gears is also not quite the same, you rely mostly on battlefield recovered loot and also some local shops (each of which only have a few items and weapon)... so no mass ordering 5.56mm and  7.62mm NATO rounds over Bobby Ray and have them air shipped to you.

That can be a bummer for long time fans of JA2 who loved that freedom.

The good news however is that for the most part...you don't need to order it, you can just make one... all those ammo and weapon attachments can be created on the field.

Not the guns mind you... those you still have to recover from loot or buy from local shops, but you no longer need to shop for attachments or ammo actually if you have the materials for them as you can make these using the materials recovered or purchased in the field.

For example: you need a suppressor? Make one, you need a steel tube and some craft mats.
Need a telescopic sight? Make one, you need a lens and some craft mats. Need more 5.56mm ammo? make them at 60 rounds a go, you just need some crafting mats... and the best part: you need more specialized ammo? like say... 9mm Armor Piercing? you can convert regular 9mm into the AP variant if you got the mats needed.


So whereas in JA2 you kinda have to order many of these to get them in reasonable quantity early, in JA3 most of these vital attachments and ammo can be created in the field quickly.

One thing to note however, these weapon attachments are tied to the specific weapon, you CANNOT make a suppressor for one weapon for example and take it off to put on another weapon, the attachment is an upgrade to A weapon and it cannot be removed intact, it instead gets turned into crafting mat refund.

So not the same as JA2, and not necessarily better or worse... it's different, but it does mean you get access to them fairly quickly and early compared to JA2 where you often have to wait until Bobby Ray shop opens and order one or you have to raid a military base early, especially for ammo and some attachments like suppressors.",1689986014,1689986014,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The strategic level gameplay is good, and I have few qualms with the bread and butter tactical engagements.  The UI is great, basically nothing about it wastes your time and most everything has or can be assigned a hotkey.  Excellent quality of life, overall.

The story seems on par for a JA game, and the NPCs I've interacted with so far have been well written.  NPC voice acting has been great so far, as well.  The mercs all seem to be as hammed up as they need to be for this series, but some of them have few enough barks in gameplay that you can wind up hearing some of them too often or too many times in a row.  There are a lot of nice smaller details as well, especially in the websites, merc bios, and even things like individual merc's usernames on the game's fictional messenger client.

There are some issues with presentation on the tactical level.  Animation timing can be off, gun sounds are mostly anemic, outside of the occasional headsplosion or full gibbing the death animations are mostly slow and uninteresting, and the tiny little bullet effects travelling at a snail's pace really just look bad (especially for rifles).  Also the music sounds weirdly compressed, but that might just be a me problem.

Finally, there's some jank in tactical gameplay.  First is that there are destructible/penetrable barriers and cover, but which is which is not readily apparent.  This means you'll wind up with flimsy looking walls that can eat a grenade and dense looking piles of junk that fall apart after one shot.  Second is that, as far as I can tell, all fired bullets are fully modeled and will damage whatever they hit and friends/foes have full hitboxes on their models.  This means that someone who is mostly obscured can be clipped by a stray round or hit a few times by a lucky full auto spray.  This is fine in and of itself, but your camera is too far out to really be able to tell if you're putting yourself in a position that might be vulnerable or if an enemy might be sufficiently exposed from a specific position.  This is mostly an issue while prone, as you lack the ability to manually control facing and a merc's legs might be sticking out to the side of whatever low cover you're trying to use or some other part might be exposed through a small gap.

Overall a good game, I think, and definitely one of the better tactics games to come out in recent years.  I can see this game easily improved or expanded by future updates and dlc, and hopefully it will be a great platform for modding as well.

Graphics updated but most of the same mercs(I hope the game has some ref to the discount mercs)
Replay ability is there. Mercs interact and give different voice lines. There are many ways to approach the situation.
The only issue I have encountered is CTD during loading the game but once in game very stable.
The humor is there, situational reacts and different mercs commenting/interjecting to the social interactions.
Its JA2 with new graphics and some gameplay fixes, ammo is shared with the squad, no more passing mags back and forth under fire. 
So far all of the updates make it prettier and smoother but it still seems the same heart of JA2 but bigger. destructible cover, special merc  abilities, sorry for the rushed review but I want to go back to playing it
edit 1 -ran into MERC ref, so comfy. enabled comments because comments.
I just got onto mainland, its good man. most maps are very detailed and all objects destructible which bring you to a semi dilemma, do I throw a grenade and probably kill that guy but also destroy what could be a crate containing something good. or do I just try to shoot him, miss, and then get downed on returned fire to discover 4 shotgun shells. 
lots of choices, lots of ways to approach the tactical situation from spawn choice.
AI is good, reactive. I came into a battle unhealed and had to restart 7-8 times but I was able to play it different each time and the AI reacted to my overwatch and destruction of cover. So I was able to replay the same setup but it was different each time, though the first seven times I took unacceptable losses.

This is a rare case where a game does justice to the original. I have not finished it yet but this is the way to do sequels to a game. Right off the bat I'll say it is not perfect. I feel there are many things missing that were present in original but the spirit of the game is captured and that is the most important part I was looking for.

So far I think the combat is pretty cleaned out with few bugs which make you a bit over-powered. The main ""misses"" are in ""map view"" where you set your operations and control your squads. I think in JA2 there was more customization and freedom of what you could do. Simple examples being things like:
- easier to view how many militia in each square
- easier to have partial groups training merc for different skills.
- the timer starts automatically after you set operations, where as I'd like to have full control as in JA2.
- sorting mercs by skills
... other many silly things

So, things that are more quality of life, which I'd like to have but I suppose not quite essential. Considering with probable business needs and time constraints I'm more than willing to forgive those misses for a good game.

IMP + Barry + Fox + Kalyna + Livewire starting off, picked up Wolf after my first cash infusion.  The merc voice lines are just the right side of campy for me most of the time - one exchange between Fox and Wolf was a bit much, but Kalyna's innocent response at the end redeemed it. She's a new favorite! I wasn't sure about Livewire but she's growing on me too, it's a nice touch that while not being a stealth character she favors it due to not being a traditional commando type.

Combat is great - love how overwatch is implemented. Shooting through enemies with a rifle on one of two shots was a treat.

Some constructive criticism:

1) I'm playing on a steamdeck (don't have time enough to be a proper ""gamer"" these days so I own that and a M1 Pro for work/general use and the black bars between text using GPTK seem annoying) and it's really hard to set up stealth encounters on the controller. Moving six mercs into position as enemies stroll into a town is near impossible, or having someone lean out more than I wanted in an overwatch and trying to get back to them and cancel it etc.

Would it be possible to get a ""pause"" mode when in real time controls to line up overwatch cones / queue up movement orders?  This is probably less of an issue and more of a gameplay challenge with M+KB.

Another tack would just be force turn based mode vs pausing real time (which might be more in the spirit of the game).

2) Steamdeck overall works great - creating a custom save is annoying with the loop from the keyboard. Could there be an option to just save when hovering over a save by hitting X and not having to go through the naming? At this point I just have one save I use as a snapshot and overwrite.

3) Softer - it'd be nice to modify overwatch cone width (to some extent) ala Phoenix Point. Not critical, and I guess scope type will play into this down the road.",1689969240,1689969923,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

This is a tough game to recommend. However, it falls short on such a fundamental level that it needs to be expressed in detail in every review so that the developers take notice and patch it in. It really is missing things that you'd expect to be in a tactical game. I'll break it down:

[list]
[*] No ability to pause the situation outside of combat and queue up orders for your squad to set up an ambush.
[*] No ability to force the game into turn based mode to accomplish the the above (as far as I can tell).
[*] Sneaking is mostly useless because it takes so long to setup up good overwatch and one spot by the enemy due to the above two issues means you get interrupted while positioning totally ruining your efforts.
[*] If you manage to get the enemy by surprise you really have no way to maximize your ambush because you start combat having used the AP for your ambush actions severely limiting the usefulness of the ambush and making you feel like you spent all that time for nothing.
[*] The way you are funded for your operations means you will either be flowing in cash or spiraling out of control and if you find yourself flush with cash there is no Bobby Ray's gun delivery system like from Jagged Alliance 2.
[*] Half of the perks for your mercs as they level are kind of trash. Leveling up usually does not feel very rewarding.
[/list]

Most of this has been observed by other reviewers. Setting up an ambush in a game like this is super critical. This is a [b]tactical[/b] game where they fumbled one of the most important aspects of tactical combat. It's a real shame.

All this said, the game is quite fun and has a lot of potential. The good news is that all of these issues could be patched into the game. They could add in Bobby Ray's. They could add in the ability to go into tactical mode even when combat is not active. They could change the ambush mechanics so that if you attack out of stealth it does not use up your AP for your first turn (or make it a perk). They can change some of the perks to make them more useful overall.

The game overall feels like a Jagged Alliance game. It has charm. The mercs are comical caricatures that we expect from the series. The Africans you are helping and fighting are all larger than life and the voice acting is very good. The choices you make with people throughout the campaign that I have experienced so far reflect the brutality of war.

If you are a big Jagged Alliance fan and need the new shiny game then pick it up. If you are unsure, wait for a patch or a sale.

It was one of my favs at the time. Starting by the first opus.
It continues to make me laugh and entertain me.

Full of cliches, probably the first things that made me really enjoy this series.
The comments of mercs during discussions. Their own identities. Fully voiced all along.
The survey dedicated to create your own merc made me laugh.
The mercs bios are a pleasure to read.
The music and the atmosphere are excellent.
It runs perfectly smoothly with all the set ups at max and it is very nice visually.
Very nice interface.
Save anytime. Autosave at every turns as well.
The multi levels of management are a pleasure. From mercs individually to the field action, the recruitment, their potential cremation, the world map...
What miss is a pause option during the real time (non yet in combat) phases to be able to order multiple mercs at the same time (or I did not find this option but it seems I am not the only one).

Only 3h in at this time but it is pure enjoyment and fun.

I have some design issues with it (burst and automatic fire has damage reduction, mines deplete as a kind of doomclock, no way to sell guns and such) but overall the game has captivated me with turn based strategy as much as Firaxis' Xcom did. There's an impressive RPG level of interwoven quests and unexpected changes from one campaign to the other. 

Even before toolkits are out people have modded in ways to fix those questionable design decisions (mine depletion and automatic damage nerfs).

It makes no sense.  The inability to pause real time or set up overwatch during the real time phase just makes the whole stealth /ambush experience frustrating  which was not the case with JA2.  Ammo scarcity is ridiculous and having to rely on rng for gunpowder to drop just doubles down on it.   Getting new guns you can't use because you have no ammo for them is awesome!  Oh, and I hate the operation UI.  It's way to finicky and clunky, and having it auto start passing time when I leave the operation screen or set a single squad to move is obnoxious.

     Also, make the game  you want to make but not giving hit percentages doesn't make people less angry when they miss.

What I like and same time hate:
1. Character development - perk system but same time I hate it ( every character have one unique perk)
2. NPC dialogue implementation
3. Weapon modification - but same time every modification made same way...(you are not looking some old camera to get lenses or some other stuff and u cant buy or order  modification for your weapons)   


What is wrong with this game:
1. Maps are too small. Some of them look like they were meant for some kind of encounter event.
2. Cover and character movement route system is clunky and not useful (especially if you will be playing an perma detah, you will die because of it), combine it with small maps and no cover and you got there a quick end of play-through;
3. No character experience bar;
4. No character fatigue bar - although game says that mercs are tired - how I am suppose to know that?! There is no indicators! Except when it just states the fact, but then it is too late. So how to plan your actions with such system?
5. When fatigued characters walk/stand like nothing - in JA2 you could see that character is tired, or wounded, even how hard it is wounded.
6. There is no more head gear pieces equipment. only few helmets and night goggles and gasmask. ( cant even modify them like add goggles to my helmet or earpices)
7. 
8. No AP description how much it will cost to reload the weapon.
9. Character inventory/equipment is simplified down. No more pockets, vests which expand them. (no modding ur armor)
10. Items don't have weight any more.
11. No more way to make an ambush. When enemy raid team is moving into a sector that mercs already are in - you can't take ambush positions, but you are forced to deploy your team into predefined areas on map, which are far away from the enemy entering spot.
12. There is a need on UI to have a setting for the fire mode (single/burst shot). Not only when aiming is being done.
13. Perk system half done - 
14. No system for wounds - enemy is being hit into the head for approximately 95% of its HP (status Almost Dead) but it does not have any wounds/status effects like blinded, dizzy, panic, bleed. It should fall down from the hit! At least in JA2 that was the case. No point losing
15. Enemy armour system - it is impossible to understand if the enemy has any armor vest or a helmet unless you specifically target that particular enemy. And it really looks stupid when during aim you notice that that there is an armor vest of some sort, but the guy stands with an upper part completely naked! 
16. FPS drops. Playing in 1080p and fps are range of  25-240... In 4k lagging likeHell
17. No mechanics of field of view (looks like mercs have their eyes on all sides of their heads). And this means there is no mechanics to turn them to the specific side.
18. No mechanics of pre-aim (in combination with mechanics of field of view mentioned just above).
19. No mechanics for moving backwards while facing or preaiming into the direction of enemy (no mechanics in either of positions: walking, prone or crawl).
20. No animation for swapping weapons.
21. No animation for putting weapon aside when climbing ladders.
22. No time passage in tactical level - in JA2 time passed while you were in tactical level as if in real time (except if you were in combat).
23. 
24. Equipment sorting and management is cumbersome. There is no ""stack all"" option, no filtering or sorting in regards of equipment type or sort.
25. Equipment size and weight problem - small one slot items (as a lock-pick) take as much space and weight as large items (crowbar). No logic. Or as stack of 10x grenades and a wire-cutter.
26. 
27. No more ammo clips! You always carry all ammo you ever found (in hundreds and thousands) or produced with you (no vehicle, nor cart as in Battle Brothers) and if you need it you basically wizard that ammo from a thin air - TikTok generation carries their ammo in a ""cloud""

It's a good base, but it needs a lot of TLC and if I'm being honest, could probably have used another 6-8 in dev on balance passes and such. 

It starts out well enough but eventually a growing list of things will begin to grind your gears... probably culminating in dust storms with quasi-suicidal shotgun brutes: A bullet sponge enemy that has infinite counter attacks at close range with a shotgun without any need for expending AP and regardless of how many times it was just shot -in the face- with 7.62. 

That's when it clicked for me and I noped out until such a time as mods or patches fix it. There's just a part of me that honestly believes that if you just took a half a dozen bullets at point blank range to the face, you'd be dead and not shooting back with shotgun attacks. My $0.02. It just violates the suspension of disbelief to the point of annoyance and/or frustration. 

Automatic weapons are not even close to deadly enough. For whatever reason, if the select switch is set on ""burst"" or ""auto"" the same ammunition hits for 1/3 of the damage.

[b][u]The bullet exiting the chamber of a gun has absolutely no information regarding the mode of operation of the firearm itself. That is to say, the damage it causes are based upon mass and speed. If a single shot does 1x25 damage, the burst damage should be 3x25. Again, there are lots of opinions on this subject, but mine is correct and whoever on the team convinced you otherwise for 'balance' reasons is wrong. It was a bad decision and you should feel bad.[/u][/b]

It doesn't make any sense whatsoever and it allows for the kind of nonsense listed above.

Love the banter. Love the environments. Story line is passable, campy fare. But it badly needs a balance pass. A burst of rifle-fire is going to take the piss, I don't care who you are or how much khat you've ingested: Simple physics. The grazing nonsense in dust storms, okay... shouldn't be 100% to-graze, but okay... 

...but the still standing after taking a triple shot burst of rifle fire to the face is just absurd. Turning to respond to the attack more absurd. Starting a new turn full AP and ready to blast you with a shotgun multiple times: pinnacle of absurd.

I know I shouldn't write reviews while I'm annoyed and like I said, this review may ultimately flip in the coming months. It's great, right until it isn't.... it's a pile of trivialities that finally result in a, ""I'll come back to this six months from now.""

Loads of 'mechanics' in this game are nothing more than save-scum fuel. Show me somebody that plays this without scumming and I'll show you a masochist. All attachments should be a simple pass-fail depending on attributes.

This is a complex, challenging and ultimately extremely entertaining game, the turn-based combat encounters of which wipe the floor with the likes of (modern) XCOM games. It might not be for you if you are either sensitive regarding problematic themes (racist and sexist slurs), or are easily annoyed by partially janky controls, AI hickups and/or finicky inventory management.

Is this a perfect game? Of course it isnt. One thing I wont do here is compare this game to JA2, mostly because I have not played in the past 20+ years, so lets just skip that part. I also wont explain the game and its structure to you because theres plenty of other sources on the internet that do a much better job at it than anything I could do here.

As the thumbsup already reveals, I do recommend this game, and I will go into more detail later on. Let’s focus first on the things I do not like so much about Jagged Alliance 3:

* Racist and sexist slurs: The game starts with kind of a trigger warning, yet it is not very explicit about its themes, so let me handle this for you: The depiction of the local population of Gran Chien is very cliche to say the least. Africans in this game are for the better part either thugs or victims who need to be rescued by our mostly white mercenary squad. On top of that, the mercenary banter is full of sexist tropes (“Not bad… for a girl! You should be proud of yourself!”) and in some cases (looking at you, Fox!) sexual innuendos. If you have very strict views about those things, you should consider whether JA3 is for you. I personally dislike these things but can accept them as the major flaw of an otherwise fantastic game. I know this is eventually fan service, however I personally think it is unnecessary for a game of 2023 (and no, humor does not need any kind of slur).

* Sometimes janky controls: Particularly the lack of pausing the real time pre-engagement phase of combat encounters is sometimes quite annoying. Interacting with objects such as lootable containers is very finicky. Oftentimes, you have to rotate the camera to get an obstructed view of the interactive object, which can be a nuisance, when you are trying to send your explosives expert to disarm a landmine that is going to go off in 5 seconds…

* Inventory management: There are A LOT of different items in JA3 such as weapons, tons of different types of ammunition, crafting materials, tools, explosives, medkits and many, many more. The inventory management is extremely basic with no filtering or any other QOL features that would be in order for a game of this complexity. If you do not like the biggest challenge of a game to be searching your squad inventory manually for ammo of the right type, then you should prepare for being annoyed frequently.

* Imperfect balancing: The game does have some balancing issues, the biggest of which, right now (a week after release) is the LMG. Given you have enough ammo, a merc squad with 3 machine guns will essentially mow down any resistance. I also feel that you can build extremely capable snipers: My main squad incudes Fox who is using a modded sniper rifle and she alone is usually taking out around 50% of enemies on any given map. Also, Overwatch, is *very* strong, to the point where it trivializes some encounters.

* Enemy AI hickups: While in general, the AI is fine, it does have its hickups: Enemies standings a few steps from my merc with no obstacles in sight run back and forth like scared chickens and eventually decide not to fire single shot. While besieging the gold mine in the northwest of the map, the AI also switched into pacifist mode altogether after a while, which made it very easy to finish them off.

With that out of the way, let me explain to you why I still love this game: Basically it boils down to the good old “they don’t make ‘em like this anymore”: In every aspect (other than graphics), Jagged Alliance feels like a classic game from the nineties:

* It is a big game. The internet will tell you the campaign takes between 75 and 100 hours to complete (depending on play style). While I have not finished the game yet, I am unable to confirm those numbers, however, looking at the map, there are still A LOT of unexplored sectors left, so I guess I have quite some mileage to go (after so far 32 hours).

* It is a complete game: Yes, this game feels complete, just like major releases used to do back in the day. As far as I can tell, there’s no cut content, and up to this point, I haven’t heard of any DLC plans from the studio. I expect there will be some, but with the selection of unique mercenaries that are in the game already, I really do not feel the devs are holding back anything from us. Buy this game now, and you’ll have plenty of content for many, many hours of play. This should set an example for other studios, as it leaves me as a happy customer who will definitely consider purchasing any DLCs are likely going to be released. If they offer similar value for money, I´d be happy to spend some more money on JA3.

* It’s a handcrafted game: The sector maps, the mercenaries, the quests and everything else in this game looks and feels like it has been purposefully crafted by people with a vision for the desired product. This makes the content so much more engaging than anything that relies on procedural generation. Granted, there are those legion attack squads and diamond shipments that come out of the RNG, but that’s about it.

* It is a finished game: When you look at recent releases of big video games, particularly on PC, you can fall into a habit of expecting games to janky on release day, to a degree where it really impacts the enjoyment of playing them. Only after several patches devs seem to get on top of bug and technical problems such as crashes, frame drops and other issues. This is NOT how a game release is supposed to go and JA3 shows. Some people seemed to have issues in the first days with coop but the devs fixed that in no time. Thus, again, this is how you do it. Kudos to Haemimont for this release!

* It is a challenging game: Some will dislike this, but JA3 demands that you figure it out yourself, and since it is quite complex, that  “figuring it out” will likely take a while. I started three times over until I had arranged my merc squad in a way that would work in the long run. While this might occur as cumbersome and annoying to some, it also feels really rewarding when you, piece by piece, learn how to use the many, many options that you have in JA3.

* It is a great game: Yes, it is a lot of fun. Turn-based combat encounters are very engaging, the strategy level on the world map also feels like there are meaningful decisions to be made. The mercenary banter is (cringe moments aside) fun and really adds to the overall atmosphere. Give this one a couple of patches to improve balancing, AI and controls, and this will be a true classic in its own right.",1689946795,1689947912,True,3,0,0.535344123840332031,0,True,False,False

My main complaint is that overwatch (with machine guns) and snipers with a silencer are too effective. They probably need rebalancing. Probably mods will fix this first. Another problem associated with overwatch is the AI that runs like lemmings into it.

I also find some mercenaries a bit too good, for example Barry, who is very cheap and comes with an extremely strong grenade ability. Another minor complaint is the sometimes poorly positioned auto camera when targeting enemies and performance issues over time that require  restarting the game.

You will fail then you will play again with experience until you get farther and fail again. It is the glorious battle brothers way.

Before i finish the game for the first time (replay value is definitely there) i will only adress the concerns of negative reviews: Yes, i like to have an active pause button for more options before the turn-based combat starts, on the other hand i would then probably play it like desperados 3... Not having that button makes things a little more exciting and unpredictable in my opinion.
Also, no, the game isnt broken because you are broke - its totally possible to never have any financial problems during 70h... No, not only a few mercs are useful - you can train the others to eliminate the weaknesses and make them really powerful (and cheap :D ). Yes, after 7-10h an ak47 may have enough weapon power, but the game doesnt end there. And technically an AMD machine isnt a problem - although i have to admit that it isnt well optimized, so i play on medium cause my room is warm enough. And the game did shut down once after ~60h, but that was the only notable bug so far and i think thats really an achievement in this days!

Automatic weapons are essentially useless, you can literally dome an enemy point blank range with an AK in burst mode and they'll just shrug it off because it'll do 12 damage. Hit him in the arm with a sniper from halfway across the map? 44 damage gg. You're literally having to rake enemies with like 6 bursts of AK to get them down. Melee weapons miss A LOT, even with mercs having half decent melee skill.

I have no idea what they were thinking not shipping with active pause (though there is a mod that will enable it) because without it stealth is extremely cumbersome to get right. In xcom you can set up nifty ambushes because it's turn based from the beginning, meaning you can send people to their positions and set up. here it's all realtime, so you can frantically be trying to move everyone into position and setup their overwatches while the enemy moves around, and 9/10 times they'll spot someone and everything will be blown because you can't manage 5 mercs at once fast enough.

There is some jank, like when you have one merc in front of another while firing on an enemy they will friendly fire each other. That's fine and makes sense. But the friendly fire is indicated by bodypart, so it will indicate that aiming at some bodyparts will incur friendly fire and others won't. So you fire at the guy's leg because it says that won't incur FF. Trolled hard, you just shot your friend in the face even though it said firing at the enemies leg wouldn't have that happen.

You want to use brutalize? It doesn't properly indicate to you whether you're in range or not. It'll play the little stabbing ghost animation which intuitively feels like you're close enough. Jokes, you didn't have enough AP and now your guy ran right next to the enemy and stood there for him to shoot you point blank in the head next turn. Generally if you don't have the AP for an action it'll grey it out, but brutalize doesn't (presumably because the AP spend will depend on the distance but there is no indication if it exceeds your available AP). I literally had to quicksave before brutalizing so that if it turned out my merc would just run and stand there I'd know he didn't have the AP do complete the action and I could reload and take another action, but that's the only way I knew.

The stealth is garbage, you have cant pause the game to do any kind of reactions, the melee stealth requires you to have line of sight with the melee character, to then target and setup an attack and then move to them all while not getting caught, but as soon as you sneak towards them they start noticing you. I have stabbed someone twice in the neck and they just shrug it off. You cant move the bodies or do anything to hide them so everyone will just see them.

If you happen to play co-op like I do, you will find desyncs over and over and over again. You dont really lose progress, but if you happen to have this happen in combat, when you reconnect you will lose all AP on everyone and the enemy gets basically a free turn.

I have ran into bugs where some times overwatch or stance will change or stop altogether. 
I have ran into bugs where you can be on a roof and it tells you no sight, but the enemy can shoot you.
I have ran into bugs where the enemy can not only see through walls and floors but shoot you through them as well.

Progression is steady with enough friction to be satisfying. All the systems are interconnected in ways that build off of each other to emphasize your mercenaries, tactics/strategy layer, and the best part of the game: the combat. 

There are so many minor and smart decisions that turn this into the most satisfying tactics combat I've played in recent memory. We could talk about how shooting different limbs can cause different effects. Or how the individuality of your mercenaries and their perks/actions can you have approach scenarios in really varied and clever ways. Or the deep weapon modding system that adds tactical nuance to how you operate your mercs. Or how intel, exploration, and battles are interconnected. But we should probably get into the most controversial design decision: the lack of chance to hit when aiming. 

Some people hate the lack of perfect information, but I love it. Hidden info spikes the tension and forces you to use every advantage you can to win fights. And funnily enough removes the frustration with missing a 99% shot. This seemingly simple decision makes the game feel refreshingly different from Xcom. The obfuscation of some info like aiming and HP makes JA3 feel less like chess and more like tense firefights where every mistake and every victory is yours. And this experience underlies why I think the game is so engrossing: choice. You get so much of it whether it's how to use your scrap, what to explore, who to hire, or what shots to take. 

But about those rough edges. The real-time stealth/ambush gets better as you get used to it, but its clunky and makes me miss Mutant Year Zero. This isn't a stealth tactics game, so I guess forgivable. The inventory/strategy UI need a quality of life update. The writing is really not hitting the level of camp it's going for and often becomes cringe instead of action movie parody. The narrative design is actually pretty impressive for this type of game with a sandbox sense of quest design and a ton more than you'd expect in terms of character lines and reactivity. My biggest criticism of the game might be the bad documentation for the rules. Granted you can play fine without it , but after a while you want more answers and what you get from the help window feels like it was written a year into development. 

All in all though JA3 slaps. The management layer is straightforward, but full of enough choice to feel strategic. Combat is thinky. fast, tense, and unforgiving yet fair. There's also a shocking amount to explore in terms of levels with smart incentives to do so. And while I do think the writing is not as funny or clever as it wants to be, this game does tell great action stories. You get to know your characters, their names, annoying/charming barks, strengths, and weaknesses.

Gun balance is one thing, but what about making controls for, you know, humanoid players? It's 2023, there were so many turn-based tactics games that you could reference.. heck, the Fallout 2 from 1998 had superior combat controls. What is this mess?
And when there's no combat and your merc spots something on the move, you're like ""what? where?"" but the game won't just tell. It's hillarious. Also trying to click on an object inside the game is like a mini-challege. Maybe it highlights on mouseover this time, maybe - the next time..

Funny thing is that I started on max difficulty, one save and permadeath. Did I lose even one merc yet? Nope. All the fights are super easy. Calling those barely moving practice targets ""AI"" would be an insult to the term.

(that Starwars Padme meme would fit here).

It is very much like the old JA2 with updated graphics and a better interface.   So far the only complaints we have are that the inventory management in CO-OP is annoying.  Swapping items is miserable in two player.   The devs should add a temp equipment pool to the out of battle squad inventory so players can just put stuff into it that they want to swap or give to the other player.  Better yet, just allow players to access each others full inventories when not in combat like you can in single player.  I know the work around is to just drop items on the ground and have the other player pick them up, but it's cumbersome.  Another fairly big problem is that it is really hard to tell where good cover is when looking at the map.  I would think any soldier in real life can tell pretty easily if they can get behind something and how sturdy it is.  There are a few other minor problems, but I'm sure they'll be patched eventually.

Edit: Since I was told I need context. The timelimit for money income is not a big deal. I like that you can modify weapons and add silencers. Annoying things are:
 * When not in combat you cannot switch to turnbased/gridmap to position troops behind cover and setup stealth attacks
 * Powercreep is very high. Once you get your first assault rifle, you will steadily face full teams of rifles that are somehow more accurate than yours as wel as MGunners and snipers that stay in the back.
 * You cant tell how likely a hit will be. Even at point blank with a pistol and 3 aim pips I still miss?
 * Theres no point in attacking arms or legs and headshots when they do hit dont apply any kind of status. The enemy AI has more movement AP and somehow can move and attack twice? Arm shots dont seem to affect AI accuracy as far as I can tell
 * Skill Issue: I couldnt clear the first outpost. I have 5 mercs but they have 12 enemies including 2 snipers, 1 enemy merc, grenadiers and rocketmen who dont care if they do friendly damage. I know someone will say I suck, and maybe I do. Thus why I found it frustrating. The AI does not follow the same rules as you.

Lets start of with the positives. The game runs well even on an old GTX1080. The levels are well designed and give good options for engaging the enemy. The mercs are fun to use with some comical voice lines and there is a wide selection to chose from. The operations menu has some interesting stuff and makes organising the militias eaiser that in BiA. Weapon modification is a big plus and allows you to switch up you play style.

I've never played the originals but I have played Back In Action and loved it. As such I have no idea why they decided to completely change the game from that recipe. The turn based combat feels like an XCOM/Wartales clone. They have completely killed the fun of planning, sync-ing, and executing ambushes and stealth kills which is what made BiA unique, now we just have yet another turn based strategy game.
The campaign map movement takes some getting used to as you can't react quickly to incoming enemies. The fatigue bars are also gone so you have to guess when your mercs will be tired. And what are the shops gone?

Also, a game that openly admits that you are likely to run out of money and fail multiple times even if you play on the easiest setting. just screams poor balancing and an ill-conceived upkeep system. It's not edgy or cool to try and recreate the ""90's Nostalgia"" of (bad) game design, what sucked back then, still sucks now.

In short, this game is great and stays true to the spirit of Jagged Alliance! After a string of face-plant followups to JA2 that just looked to capitalise on the JA name, this game actually pulls it off!

If you're a veteran of JA1/2/1.13 you're in good hands. Rather than go over all the details that are already in many other reviews, I'll just point out the highlights that I think you should care about:

★ The character personalities and kitschy commentary (such a huge part of the original games) are reflected well here and really capture the feel of the classic games.

★ Action points & gun-play are similarly engaging. After briefly trying the mods that show CTH (chance to hit) like the originals, I'm a fan of the new system where the numbers aren't show. Relying on merc comments and general indicators changes the feel for the better.

★ Managing stealth in the real-time (pre-combat) portion is awkward at first and a pause feature has been heavily requested. That said, you do get used to it but I'd like to see it get refined future updates.

★ There are some QoL improvements that would be welcome like synchronising 2 squads to attack a sector from different sides, managing ammo between squads (a pain at the moment), auto stopping/avoiding noticed traps, etc. but none of these thing take away from the general excellence of this game!

If you haven't played a JA title yet, this is an excellent way to get started. The modern UI/graphics/etc. make it much more accessible than the earlier titles. And, if you love it, you've always got JA2+1.13 to look forward to ;-)

If you're a big fan of Jagged Alliance 2, this plays very differently. It's undergone a bit of a shift akin to the X-Com reboot. Combat maps are much, much tighter with very limited room to manuever, and the guns are perhaps more cartoonish than in JA2.

And there's definitely a whole bunch of jank. Trying to set an ambush for an enemy assault squad is an exercise in real-time micro-management. Diagonal cover is largely gone. Geometry is really weird, and there's all kinds of times where one of your mercs sees an enemy, takes careful aim, and just puts an entire burst right into the rock at their feet.

It's easily the best game to bear the Jagged Alliance name since Jagged Alliance 2. Yes, that's a very low bar, but it's one that's been tripped over multiple times. But the personality is there, and it plays like good, cheesy action-movie fun. The moment that really secured the thumbs up-for me was one where I recruited a retired merc unit of really angry old ladies to help me defend a port I'd just taken and I looked at that counterattack and went ""uh oh""... until the old ladies tore into their flank.

- UI is really lacking. There are so many standard options you'd expect in the age of JA2 that are not in JA3, like dividing ammo and medicine stacks and put them into map stash for the next squad to pick up. No, you have to bring both squads into the same sector. And various other things (shops as interactable ""bazaar"" tables etc.)
- interacting with objects is a nuisance. Often you have to zoom in and find the right pixel to pick something up.
- always under stress: Without mods, you will be constantly racing against bankruptcy. I can understand they do not want players linger indefinitely in some town maxing stats via training and things like that, but the pressure is really, really overdone in my opinion.
- bad balancing: all you ever need is sniper rifles, they are simple outclassing everything else in any situation, especially with ammo scarcity making damage per bullet the deciding factor in choosing weapons.

The game isnt bad if you can overlook how unrealistic weapons are. Shotguns, SMGs and pistols feel useless. ARs are really weak and a suppressed sniper rifle makes the encounters trivial. Hell, even at close range sniper rifles are more effective than other weapons. Not to mention AK 47s sharing ammo with Dragunovs...

I didnt get far in the campaign to see much weapon variety, but man, in JA:BiA you had access to much more from the start because of Bobby Ray, which they decided to remove from this game. Now you're stuck with what you loot and it isnt much, forcing you to use different types of weapons, but in the end, you're just distracting enemies with said weapons while the sniper is doing all the killing.

Last but not least, Ive no idea why they decided to go with turn based in this game instead of real time with pause like JA:BiA, Crossfire or 7.62 High Caliber. Real time with pause is more fluid when playing stealth/ambush games.

Mods might make the game more enjoyable in the near future, but for now I cant recommend the game. Just play JA:BiA, Crossfire or 7.62 High Caliber instead if you want a tactical game.",1689875069,1689875069,False,1,2,0,0,True,False,False

And the scale has finally tipped for me to thumbs down in the recent fight, because enemies not using the same ruleset as you just sucks:

Enemies do not use the same rules as you.
- They get extra movement to all get into cover as soon as one of them notices you
- They either have a different Action System, or get way more Action Points than you. They can move more distance than you ever could AND still shoot.
- Sometimes they just know where your team is, even if they are stealthily in cover on another side

Overwatch
- The system itself is not bad, it just isn't implemented well. Again its outside the ""rules"" Why can I get more shots out of overwatch than I could do with even the lowest accuracy in my turn? Since the game is obviously balanced with that in mind, it screws the balance up.

No Pause
- Seriously the largest issue. The AI can act all at once, why not allow it for me too? Or at least willingly turn into Turn Based Mode.

Smaller Maps
- The maps are very condensed, sometimes they feel more like a puzzle instead of a combat field
- There are far less ways to use soldiers to get the lay of the land and use different approach vectors (tangled with how different movement now works in combat, and how different it is for you vs enemies)

Cover
- Hard to assess, since some of it is made to evaporate. What, you just shot through the enemy at this corrugated sheet? Lets make confetti out of it, and the neighboring one. (Instead of have a hole in it)
- Cars start to burn and will explode after sometimes one stray hit (Is that one of the things you want to make fun out of?)

Far less Mercenaries than JA 2
+ Admittedly, you can hire a few of the better ones earlier.
- Overall the roster is mainly old ones, but reduced
- Several well liked mercenaries are not there (Subjective, but for me its Spider, Trevor, Stephen and Buzz)
- There is no alumni gallery as before, where you could find out what happened to the absent ones
- The explosive specialists are still the same annoying ones than in JA 2 - but of course less of them.

Mercenary design
- They feel ""flanderized"". Some seem to be a caricature of their old selves.
- The more inexperienced ones have exaggerated that status since JA 2, instead of becoming more grounded since Arulco (See MD)
- The portraits and puppets look mostly like Fashion show. In JA 2 they felt more professional.
- Equipment isn't shown, so the ridiculous ones stay that way the whole game
- IMP Mercenary has far less choice, has no voice and no lines. It feels like a wooden marionette instead of your avatar. (Very many ----- for that. I loved it in JA 2 and left it out now)

Grenades
+ They handle better
+ You actually find enough to use them
- You now really seem to need them

Story elements
+ You now have a bit more obvious control over how some encounters will run
- There are in the beginning very few likeable people you can talk to.",1689869303,1689869303,False,107,4,0.679537117481231689,0,True,False,False

Their idea to release modding tools at launch helped greatly as most of the problems that I had were solved by diligent modders. My list of cons might be large but they are mostly small nitpicks that need detailed explaining, and are not game-breaking design decisions.

Pros:
- Mod support at launch; many small problems can be fixed by others who have already tweaked values to make the game more enjoyable, easier or harder. Definitely a big bonus if you play this game and find a mechanic you don't like.

- Great tactical game-play that rewards patience and planning. Setting up a successful Overwatch Ambush is very, very satisfying. Positioning, spacing, time of day, and using the environment to your advantage is extremely important and can win or lose the fight for you before it even began.

- The characters are written quite well and aren't overbearing annoyances like many other character driven hero games.

- A very enjoyable setting with vibrant, beautiful maps to explore and kill bad-guys in. The battle maps in the game are absolutely phenomenal! Who ever did you level designs, give them a raise!

- Fun and enjoyable quests that don't overstay their welcome.

- Great enemy variety, the Legion fights differently from the Military who fights differently from the PMCs. They all use different equipment and different tactics with different skills and perks you have to plan around.

- Melee mercs aren't totally useless! Melee is good, if not absolutely fantastic when dealing with close-quarters encounters. They deal high damage and attack many times a turn, move very quickly, and get Grit to keep themselves alive. The ability to throw knives has also made Melee characters have huge staying power even way later in the game.

Cons:

- No weapons catalog or ammo store, replaced by shops found around the map that sell specific respawning equipment and ammo. Due to this, ammo is a scarce premium resulting in a narrowing of effective weapons/builds. I fixed this with adding a mod that increases weapon and ammo drop-rates by 50%.

- Many weapons pale in comparison to each other, and that makes me sad inside. Pistols lose purpose rather quickly. SMGs that are capable of adding the Extended Barrel modification are generally better choices than Assault Rifles until you start getting NATO equipment. LMGs eat up so much ammo that they are functionally worthless. As some others will point out, Snipers are generally best in slot at all levels and points in the game due to high damage and high accuracy.

- Damage based on weapon class and ""tier"" and not caliber is a very strange decision to me. Speaking entirely about ballistics here, 7.62x51mm NATO should have near-equivalent damage performance out of an M14 (22 inch barrel) an M24 rifle (24 inch barrel) and an FN-FAL (21 inch barrel) with the only difference being precision due to weapon action.

- Burst Fire and Automatic Fire takes a weapon's damage, multiplies it, then divides by the number of bullets fired during the attack. Shooting somebody 3 times in semi-automatic and shooting somebody 3 times in burst fire should deal the same amount of damage, no? It would definitely give Assault Rifles a very deadly niche, and make LMGs a dominating force multiplier.

- With ammo being a premium, playing as a stealth sniper is incentivized. Stealth sniper is so way-away better than almost all builds in the game that you can run 6 stealth snipers and casually roll all combat encounters with six guaranteed kills every turn. As said previously, I fixed this by simply installing a mod that increased 50% of weapon and ammo drop-rates.

- Diamond mines running out simply sucks. It requires you to play the over-world very fast and plan around the fact that your budget is going to go away. Completing quests and training militia in the settlements to increase the amount of money you get a day from the mine is a trap as it's better for you to ignore the nearest settlement and rush to the next mine because the mine is going to run out anyways and then you'll have no Mercs to complete the mission with. It also makes it to where better Mercs are extremely prohibitive because one day your mines are going to run out. Lastly, it's completely immersion breaking, because why the hell is Adonis doing anything in a country which is about to be dry on diamonds in five months? This was fixed with a mod and has made my time with the game much more enjoyable.

- Your IMP doesn't interact with other Mercs and doesn't have in game dialogue with people around the world. There are also only 3 portraits and models per gender, and only one voice per gender which is kinda lame but it is what it is. If they ever do an update for more customization options on the IMP would be awesome!

- The change of mercenaries from roll-fillers to hero-units with unique abilities is something that I don't particularly like. My reason for this being a con is that some characters are insanely good ""must-haves"" establishing a clear meta for who you should hire immediately instead of having a few characters who all do the same thing and can be replaced depending on who you want in your party at that time. For example, the mechanic Vikki has the highest mechanical stat in the game, but her unique perk is that all items passively repair when she's in the party. Her cheaper counterpart, Livewire, grants UAV sight on all enemies in a sector with which you have Intel on and that you gather double intel when hacking with her which is arguably way, way better.

- Weapon mod crafting failures eating weapon durability, scrap, and crafting parts is a pain and I hate it.

- Ammo and explosives crafting isn't exactly great, especially because you can't break-down ammo and explosives for parts to create something that you actually want to use.",1689864411,1689864834,True,15,0,0.604474306106567383,0,True,False,False

As for how well the game runs, I didn't have any issues. But I do have a high-end computer, so keep that in mind.

I wish they would have done more to build on the classic. Instead this feels like a modernisation rather than a evolution. For example they could have added more tactical features, like vehicles, a more realistic combat system or a more in depth RPG system.

Also there is a mid-game event that tries to shakes things up, but you have to retread already played maps just with tougher enemies and this is not fun at all. There is one fight on the island fortress which is just painful to play, not difficult, just painful.

An RPK-74 is a DIRECT irrefutable upgrade to an MG42. Not situational. Completely superior in every way. Pews faster..and..it's 7.62 WP.. There is apparently no 5.45. Or 7.62x54r. Or several other rounds you'd expect.. .45 ACP

Enemies are suicidal.. they will absolutely throw their lives away to inflict damage on you. This feels more like XCom than anything.. but within the genre.. there is no way they can claim to not have used BIA as their reference.

If this was advertised as a direct sequel to BIA.. I'd say that it is a damned good one..but the fact that it used BIA in their promotional campaign, with negative implications towards it.. really seems in bad taste.

I'll switch this to positive when modding support comes out, as long as it is legit.. A good game..but only if you liked BIA or XCom (I enjoyed both)

I'm leaving this negative because steam does not have a neutral review..and though I like the game.. I really don't find it to be enjoyable with this cartoon level of balancing.

Ignoring the fact that comparing it to JA2 isn't really constructive, the game as it stands has a lot of problems. Weapon balance is all over the place, (snipers being the best weapon for every role, all automatics being useless, etc) and that in turn affects both your optimal choices of team gear and how you try to approach all combat. Inevitably the best approach ends up being ""stealth sniper kill everything"" simply because all other options are flat out terrible. This is neither interesting nor fun.

Character progression balance is similarly all over the place. Recruitable mercenary starting traits vary between useless and game breakingly strong (e.g. 3 bonus AP every kill, or 4 permanent extra AP for being several tiles away from friendlies) Perks that are available to choose on the other hand are almost entirely meaningless. They don't really alter your power through the game and you can very well stealth snipe your way to victory ignoring them completely. This has the effect of forcing players to pick the characters with ridiculous starting traits and ignore all others as trap options, and since you don't care about perks your character progression effectively ends at level 1. This could be fixed by swapping a lot of perks with the available traits, because at least you could build towards some element of power, but it wouldn't fix the balance issue itself.

On the whole JA3 is a soft pass. Give it a year for patching and (hopeful) balance passes, and pick it up on a deep discount if at all. The game needs serious balance work to get where it needs to go.",1689829197,1689829197,False,56,5,0.626774072647094727,0,True,False,False

While these modded versions of JA2 will remain the absolute kings, JA3 has the potential to be right up there among them; if the modding scene develops enough for this game. (As of the time of writing, I have not yet checked out any mods.)

Content wise, JA3 is good enough. It introduces its mechanics without annoying tutorials, choosing instead to show you tooltips when you hover over things, and sub-tooltips to explain specific terms or symbols. In my opinion, this is the superior way of explaining your game to newbies. The difficulty is as hard as you want it to be; you can have it as hard as nails as you like or go for one of the lower difficulties and options for a more relaxed experience.

The setting is endearing, with plenty of different environments and stereotypically but not badly depicted characters. Grand Chien feels primarily based on Haiti, with mishmashes here and there.

The merc selection is a little light, especially early on, but the game makes up for that with a LOT more dialogue than I expected. It gives JA3 the sort of A-Team slash The Wild Geese vibe that I'm sure is still at the core of the franchise's inspirations.

All in all... I recommend it. As a diehard fan of Jagged Alliance 2 that hasn't booted up the game because it's a pain to set my display to 16-bit mode just to start a game (ah, laziness, right?), it's good to have a modern game that pays respects to its good predecessors.

Why is it that a game made almost a quarter of a century ago , Commandos Behind Enemy Lines, displays more tactical depth and realism than JA3? In fact, from a tactical perspective, everything you have to do in JA3 is find a high ground or a secluded place with one or two choke points and use overwatch, rinse and repeat. Enemies will rush you in an irrational elan devoid of any sign of intelligence. I played for 12 hours maximum difficulty without a single scratch by using this approach over and over again; laughable.

The game's flaws remind me of Wasteland 3, where you would be exposed to a myriad of weapons and types of ammunition that made no difference whatsoever: JA3 is a vacuous gun encyclopedia with no real tactical content. In a game where enemies have a points-based health, terminal ballistics are irrelevant...

Maps are too small, stealth unusable, combat simplistic and repetitive...by the way, how can you miss when attacking an enemy from behind with a knife? Take a pillow and try stabbing it, see how many times you miss...and you're not a trained merc. By the way, even if you stab them in the neck they might survive, not bleed to death and continue combat.

Also, combat can only be initiated in real time which is bizarre for a turn-based tactical game...not sure I understand that decision.

  - Stealth is worthless unless you're killing lone enemies in 1 shot without alerting. You can't coordinate stealth attacks. You can kinda tell a melee person to stab somebody in stealth, then while he's moving to the enemy, you can try to time a silenced bullet at another target, but it can be difficult to time. 
  - There is little need for stealth perks since the ideal stealther simply needs high marksmanship with a high accuracy, high damage silenced weapon.
  - The action that initiates combat does NOT refund it's AP when combat starts, further disincentivizing stealth. You're better off opening with a grenade on a cluster of enemies that hasn't scattered yet. 
  - Pincer maneuvers work against you, since enemies immediately know where all your nearby units are at combat start. 
  - Rocket launcher enemies have more range and accuracy than a sniper. Pin point accuracy across the map, and can fire every turn, often 1-shotting people. I have yet to see them miss even with ranges beyond my rifles. And I don't mean hitting the floor next to me, I mean they hit me or my militia DIRECTLY every gd time. Yes proning lowers the damage I take, but they still hit me directly. It's ridiculous. I think part of the problem is they've tied accuracy to the range of the weapon, and these weapons have absurd range. This accuracy/range relation makes hitting a moving target with a manual rocket launcher an easier task than hitting them with a rifle. 
  - Mid-to-late game melee is game-breakingly good. Free movement is increased by having low/no armor. Free movement is increased by starting your turn in cover. Free movement can be regained by melee'ing enemies. Free movement can be used to melee attack (this part might actually be unintended). No limit. See the problem? Instant enemy cluster deletion. 
  - Enemies with reactions can react to things happening behind them. Examples: Some enemies have a chance to shoot back after taking a hit, or some enemies can melee you after taking an action ANYWHERE adjacent to them. If you have 2 melee units on both sides of a melee enemy, you can stab him in the back and he'll turn, face you, and stab you back. Your other unit now has his back, so you stab it. He turns to face you, and stabs you back. It's a stupid mechanic. There's an alligator enemy (yes the animal) that does this exact thing. It turns without any movement penalty, and can melee counter anything within 2 squares for 50-60 damage, omnidirectionally.
  - The game doesn't give you a good enough indication of the odds of landing a shot. Granted if a person/body part is not visible or obstructed, it will tell you, which is good. I don't necessarily want the exact percentage chance to land a shot. I would be happier with something that says 'very bad'/'bad'/'average'/'good'/'very good' chances of landing the shot.
  - There's also some really dumb pathing issues. Imagine a gate connected to a fence. My merc can see there's an alarm on the gate, so I tell him to cut through the fence with his wire cutters instead of dealing with the alarm. So what does he do? He goes through the gate to the other side of the fence to cut it, while triggering the alarm. 
  - Some performance issues with this game. The FPS dips quite a lot even with a 3090-Ti, set to medium graphics settings. Another weird thing, even though the game seems to support uncapped framerates in the video settings, the game doesn't seem to go above 100 FPS, even on low graphics at 1920x1080. 
  - I might be misremembering, but I remember there being meaningful injuries in Jagged Alliance 2. If I kept attacking somebody's legs, it could force them prone, and even cripple them permanently. If any of this happened to your mercs, you would need to keep that mercenary alive and heal them after the battle to fully recover. They seem to have ditched all the meaningful injuries for debuffs that only last for 1 turn. Shooting an enemy in the legs slows them for 1 turn. That's it. Additional shots to the legs only do damage. Call me sadistic, but picking your enemies apart and adding other cool effects like knocking them down/back, or blowing off a leg with a shotgun would've made this game so much cooler. 

It's a shame steam only has recommend/don't recommend. It's just missing some common sense things I would expect in a strategy game in this age. The level design is great, I love the mercenary interactions with eachother, and the story/side quests are actually quite good. There's just dumb stuff inhibiting strategy variety, and incentivizing boring strategies like hiding and abusing overwatch.",1689700625,1689812305,False,311,10,0.774990856647491455,33,True,False,False

I am enjoying the game, although it is punishingly hard. I think they do need to give % chance to hit, or some explainers of when you should / shouldn't go for headshots.

Whilst the lack of character customisation initially irked me, I quite like the 80's action movie characters, and they grew on me in the end.

However, I gave up mid-game when the enemies become bullet sponges. I'm reasonably certain that 67 damage point blank to the head with an AK-47 is going to kill someone, or at least incapacitate them! I'd rather the enemies remained normal humans (and not bullet sponges) but were better equipped, had harder positions to take etc. Whilst I can't imagine deploying on a tough mission with only a pistol and a knife, those sort of difficulties seemed more realistic than bad guys with concrete heads. As you can tell by now, that really wound me up! 

I find upping HPs on bad guys a bit boring. A human is a human - and a 7.76 round should be as deadly in the late game as it is in the early game.

It's got a ton going for it, and much working against it -- there are some definite issues, but nostalgia, for sure, is what works against JA3 the most.

Lots of negative reviews are framed with 'ah yes, I've played JA2 for YEARS, and I played 1.13 for even longer than vanilla, and this game is GARBAGE, and overwatch is BROKEN.' If you've spent the last 20 years replaying the intensely niche ecosystem of JA2 1.13, this is going to be a hugely frustrating transition. Ammo and weapons are simplified, as are combat mechanics, the tighter battlefields, and the limited economies. But if you spent the last 20 years playing numerous other squad turn-based tactical combat games, you'll find this game is a firmly modern offering with a slight a retro twist, only deviating a bit from the modern tropes. And mostly this is a fine thing.

A lot has happened since 1999. Several tactics-focused RPG(-ish) franchises come to mind playing this. Obviously XCOM and Phoenix Point, but also to a lesser degree the Pillars of Eternity and Divinity Original Sin games. The later games PoE and DOS retained the classic tropes of deep inventories, crafting, vast customization, sprawling maps, and endless tactical combat possibilities (which can sometimes work against those games); the former games in the New XCOM mode evolved modern tropes focused on arcadey minimalism by dropping complex inventories, offering fewer combat skills and items, tightening maps. Classic tropes games are a 100+ hour experience, and modern tropes games clock in closer to 45 hours. Classic tropes games have so many skills that you need hotkeys, and modern trope games can fit everything on a controller. Lots of other examples are around like Xenonauts, but most go generally down either the classic or modern tropes path.

Jagged Alliance 1 and 2 are undeniably in the classic tropes zone -- they were the games that defined those tropes in the first place. But Jagged Alliance 3 is solidly in the modern tropes zone. And franchise nostalgia makes you want to frame this game as a classic tropes game when it totally isn't. This is a modern tropes game in the skin of a Jagged Alliance classic. 

'Overwatch is broken' -- like it actually has been in every modern tropes tactical combat game since the new XCOM. XCOM 1 and 2 both were balanced around overwatch being ultra powerful mechanic for controlling space and dishing out damage at the cost of burning ammo. I especially made entire merc builds around overwatch in XCOM 2. JA3 is likewise balanced around overwatch being a bread-and-butter tactic. For sure, I have stomped squads with just one very well placed machine gunner. But since JA3 has ultra intense resource scarcity, especially for health and ammo, overwatch is even more powerful for and against player success. It's not an inherently good or bad mechanic, but just a now very expected mechanic in this genre.

But, oof, that resource scarcity changes everything in this game. Diamond mines are finite, and so are meds. There is no longer an online shop to get shipments of guns and ammo. And if there's a trader anywhere, I've yet to meet them -- I think I read there's one at some point? Weapons, ammo, and gear are mainly cobbled together from loot. For me this has translated mostly to moving way faster through the map than in JA2, where money was easier to come by, and so was time healing and training more mercs. 

Is stealth useless? Not exactly. Not completely, at least. You get to take the first shots, get time to set up some 'WOW IT'S TOTALLY BROKEN' overwatch, and do get a decent bonus for a stealth kill. The real time element makes it far less effective, on one hand, requiring fast decisions and snappy micromanagement. It forces you to make fewer quick decisions rather than plotting out an intricate ambush. 

So. The smaller inventories, the smaller economies, smaller maps, shorter deployment times, fewer abilities -- all of these design decisions point to this being a modern tropes, arcadey tactics game meant to last under 50 hours and played rapidly--the antithesis of Jagged Alliance before. But it is the state of the art now in an era where console and PC games overlap. 

Does this make JA3 a shit game? I don't think so. Really, the modern vs classic tropes dichotomy is a whole fucking vibe, man, and one has a preference. This game deviates only a bit from the modern trope formula. There are no % indicators -- the UI has enough information and mercs offer audio context to still generally gauge if you're in range. There are action points instead of numbers of actions per turn. Absolutely, there are level design and balance issues with certain encounters ([spoiler]look, how many landmines do we really need? And this ~10 man ambush leaving the abandoned mansion cellar with almost no cover? Good god... what? Why?[/spoiler]). The economy is definitely too lean at the moment. Coming from tactics games with better RPG elements, I'd really love more character customization for the one character you can create, and to see the actual gear mercs are wearing. Beyond those shortcomings, the combat is great and pretty responsive. For what this game is, it does well.

But two things. One: It's 2023. No game is ever done at launch any more. The patched experience in six months will rebalance a ton, if the devs are on top of this. And two: MODS. I can easily see that with mods, this game will be rock solid in about a year. The community will fully iterate on this in a way that improves the vanilla experience, and also offers whatever truly broken bullshit the people demand.

The experience as it is now is a firm 7/10. If you like the genre and liked new XCOM, you'll probably like this. If you played JA 1.13 for too long, you'll dive onto your grenade. If you need something newish with the depth of all the classic tropes, like flea market sized inventories and scores of abilities and absurd combat strategies in a 100+ hour package, DoS2 is the best turn-based tactical combat RPG from the last 10 years.",1689803556,1689803556,True,1,0,0.509394586086273193,0,True,False,False

JA3 has a similar feel to JA2 with some modern amenities. As a vet to the originals, it invokes the same feelings; great mercs, great story, makes you laugh, love all of that. The TBS is there also. It took decades, but true fans and one of the ORIGINAL developers helped create this true sequel.

What I miss(and hope MODs can be made to add these things, or are patched in):

-Bobby Rays. I want to go to a website and browse a catalog of gear to ship to my mercs to use. that Micromanagement aspect of the game I actually LOVE. We need that.

-weight system

-Inventory system remake. I LOVED 1.13 and depending on what you wear, you get extra gear slots. 

-more piles of weapons and gear(pretty sure Mods will add to this.. I may make some myself)

This game, despite all its claims to be a successor of the Jagged Alliance franchise, the only thing that represents Jagged Alliance in it is A.I.M and I.M.P.

Jagged Alliance was a squad simulation that tried to bring squad combat as close to real life as it was possible at the time. This game is anything but nothing even close to reality.

In general the game looks and feels like being developed by children.

Character:
Stats in most are copied from the original Jagged Alliance franchise with one change - Explosives. Explosives stat determines mercs ability to use any device that can explode. In reality grenades and explosive devices can be easily taught to be used by anyone. Any soldier or mercenary knows how to use the absolute majority of them. It should have been just by default that all mercs know all that. Explosives stat should have been (like in original the Jagged Alliance) responsible for manipulating/changing existing explosive devices as well as creating new and improvised devices.

Strategic:
Very small in comparison to Jagged Alliance 2. Few little towns while Jagged Alliance 2 had 8. Small towns as well as some bigger cities. It has many extra locations.

The UI is huge which makes it cumbersome. Also anything UI related opens to cover the whole screen. This creates a bad user experience by detaching the player from the game. Jagged Alliance 2 had a neat UI that was nice and never removed the player from the game except where it made sense - laptop. Be it strategic map or in sector, UI was integrated into it keeping the player in the game.

Having crafting and repairing as operations does not make sense. They are just not operations. They should have been done as assignments.

JA v.1.13 did a good job about this and not only. 1.13 really represented what JA fans want - realistic squad simulator. Why on earth did developers decide to ignore it and create some childish game of nonsense?

Annoying is that time starts playing after you set a destination for the squad or start operation. In many cases you have to click the stop button right after it if you plan some other actions or operations. Time should be managed manually by the player.

Tactical:

Sectors are very small.

Sneaking. Never saw anything as foolish as sneaking in this game. You put mercs in sneaking mode and they can pass right in front of the enemy. Merc and enemies have no sight cone or something that would make it realistic. They see in all 360 degrees. No need to position you merc and cover different sectors to avoid being flanked. This also affects sneaking as the enemy sees you from behind. You kind of have limited time to kill the enemy.

In the original Jagged Alliance there was no such nonsense as sneaking. It was realistic. There was a mode you can turn to make mercs to try moving quietly. But that would not make them invisible or something foolish. If the enemy sees them he sees them. Success of being not heard by the enemy depended on agility and dexterity. But there was always a chance that merc would make noise and would be detected by the enemy.

Also, sneaking occurs in real time making it very cumbersome. No way to coordinate 2 or more mercs to take down 2 or more enemies.

In JA2 enemy and mercs had a sight cone. Distance would also affect how well the enemy or merc can detect opponents. That would depend on stance (standing, crouched or prone) plus obstruction. Enemies as well as players would use natural environments like trees, bushes, tall grass to hide and attack while being hidden and avoid detection as much as possible.

Cover system in this game continues a simplified mechanic invented by XCOM that has nothing to do with reality. Enemies or mercs would simply stand or crouch behind the cover and jump out to make a shot. In some cases they would stay behind the cover if the game decides that a shot can be made without leaving the cover. This is the only difference here and a plus.

In reality, one hide behind the cover all the time even when making shots. Only expose yourself as much as needed. That being some small parts of body, arms and head to greatly reduce a chance of being hit. You only leave a cover to make a shot if that is safe and you need to move out of cover to be able to have line of fire.

Also, because the cover is low does not mean you cannot fully hide behind it. If the cover can hide your whole body when you crouch it offers no less coverage and protection as high cover when you can stand. The difference here would be that you get tired and take extra effort to stick out when you need to take a look or make a shot.

Cover body coverage should be based on its ability to hide the whole body regardless if you have to crouch or stand.

This is what should have been improved properly since the original Jagged Alliance did not have proper mechanics when it came to some covers. Legacy of that time.

Overwatch is a disaster and should never have taken place in Jagged Alliance. It is a simple XCOM invention to make a very simple combat mechanic to make a game that anybody can play. Simply said to make as much money as possible. That is not what Jagged Alliance ever stood for. Jagged Alliance was a game for players that wanted a sophisticated and realist squad simulator.

While overwatch was tailored in XCOM and others that followed to work well with overall game mechanics, here they changed it so it is just big nonsense. So when you overwatch your merc (enemies as well) would jump out of the cover and stay like that until they run out of all overwatch attacks. This would allow enemies to keep shooting at an exposed merc. In overwatch merc would shoot at any enemy which is foolish. Soldiers choose targets and when to shoot and don’t just shoot at any enemy they see in some cone of overwatch. Also overwatch shots always fire in the type of fire designated for specific weapon. Automatic weapon would always fire burst and you cannot choose a single shot instead. Also, you cannot choose how well to aim. You just don’t have any control as to who and how you merc shoots.

To summarize no realistic reaction system, but instead a disastrous copy of overwatch from XCOM and Gears Tactics.

Weapons stats have nothing to do with reality. Their damage is probably some progression. As you progress you find guns and bullets that do more damage to kill more advanced enemies. Just like any simplified game out there. The Attachments system is ridiculous. You craft them from weapon parts rather than buying or finding them and attaching them. They cannot be removed and attached to some other gun that has proper mounting. Weapon parts are just some generic resource rather than something realistic. You can also craft ammo from that generic resource. Just another copy of crafting mechanics from some simplistic game.

In Jagged Alliance weapon stats were based on some measure that would reflect weapons as realistically as possible. Damage would depend on its and the bullet's ability to do damage and penetrate. This brings us to armor. Armor in this game just reduces damage taken rather than represent realistic protection and penetration. Most armors can withstand only a few hits from decent guns and armor piercing ammo. US latest military armor can withstand in general 6 hits (you can google it). Depends of course on the bullet and its energy. And then that armor won’t offer much protection. Nothing like that in this game. Just foolish damage reduction.

No real ballistic at all.

Enemies are some clowns. Mercs always look the same regardless of what they wear.

I can just go on and on… Game is so bad there’s no end to all bad sides of it.

Jagged Alliance title should have never been sold to anybody so that its memory never got smeared so badly.

One thing I cannot understand is why Ian Currie takes part in all this. Is he really so desperate for money to continually mock everything Jagged Alliance was.",1689801877,1689801877,False,3,0,0.480664253234863281,0,True,False,False

Are there a few things that could be a bit better? Yes of course, almost every game has it. 
If you enjoy the old JA or new XCOM titles, this is the game for you.
I'm by no means very good at these types of games but on the normal difficulty its nicely challenging and I'm already planning on checking out the higher ones, whenever I'm done here.
The story and characters have the right amount of pulp and don't take themselves too seriously. On the other hand, parts of the story do show gruesome storylines/characters. So it fits right in the with the heyday on 90s action flicks.

Graphically it's completely fine for what it needs to be.

A few small issues:
Optimisation: i have a fairly powerful PC and on high I end up around 72FPS, on all maxed sub 60. That shouldn't be the case, but is also no deal breaker as the graphics on high are fine. Hoping it get's better in that regard tho.
Multi-Floor fights can be quite confusing and sometimes it switches to a worse floor again after selecting a Merc. Ends up in me needing to use the keys to switch floors more than I would like.
A few times i ""missclicked"" what i wanted to do, due to wonky hitboxes (and me being stupid). I. E. closing/opening doors instead of positioning next to them. Clicking on a merc instead of the hackable device etc.

Regarding the ""Chance to hit"" issue some have. It took me a few fights as well, but now I can only agree with the developers, you get all the info you need from the mercs (although would be nice to trigger it again, in case you missed it) and i really enjoy the way it's implemented.

Can't wait to see where full mod support and the general future will take this gem. Finally JA2 got the follow up it deserved.

Which leads to enemies running in your face, shooting you, and when you want to kill them they give you a few more shots in the face.

Kind of defeats the whole action point concept, no?

After playing ~20+ hours for myself, I have to say that most complaints are being very extreme. The COOP was fixed in the first day and I have not experienced any problems connecting with my friend. A lot of people want this to be an exact copy of JA 2 which doesn't make sense. This isn't a remaster, it's a successor that wants to go it's own way. 

I've enjoyed pretty much every moment of this game so far, from the cheesy story / dialogue to satisfying gameplay. I'd give it a 8/10 if I had to give it a number. It's a solid game, especially if you crave sort of a Xcom-esc game with COOP.

THOUGH, That's not to say that there isn't a bit ""jank"", because that's how I would explain it.

- Playing COOP, when your friend does an order or clicks in a menu, your menus closes which can be slightly annoying but you get used to it. [i] It has however killed a merc TWICE because I'm about to click to shoot, but then my HUD disappears and I use all my AP to move out of cover. Beware lmao  [/i]
- Can be near impossible to see Overwatch / retreat areas sometimes. A lot of the UI can be iffy overall ngl

Jagged Alliance is a franchise I've loved from its very first game back in 1995. The first game is one of my all time favourites and my mind was blown away with the sequel back in 1999. The games that have followed since have been a mixed bag ranging from complete garbage to kind of ""meh.""

I'm happy to finally say it. Jagged Alliance 3 is good. It's really good.

Jagged Alliance 3 retains its familiar style of hiring mercenaries to fight for a cause in a remote, third world location. This time we're saving a captured president only a year after freeing Arulco from the grasp of Deidranna's iron fist.

The mercs you hire are a colourful bunch. They are delightfully quirky. Almost all the fan favourites are still around and some new faces too have entered the fray. Needless to say, just like in the previous games, they have tons of character, every single one of them and you'll quickly find which ones you'd prefer to have in your team over the others. It's just a shame that the amount of mercs is noticeably smaller than in the previous game.

Every character has a bunch of statistics such as wisdom, strength, dexterity, marksmanship, medical skills and so on. All of these stats measure different things the mercs can do and affect how well they do it. Dexterity helps you move further, sneak and aim better whereas wisdom has you noticing hidden goodies and learning faster on the field.

Your mercs improve their skills by doing activities involving them. Spending time moving around improves their health and agility for example and tinkering with devices and maintaining gear improves the mechanical skill. As they gain new experience levels they become more effective at fighting against the enemy soldiers, but unlike the previous games, this time around they also gain perk points which you can use to further customise them. You can for example improve how far the characters can move for free each combat turn and remove penalties to movement from wearing heavy body armor.

Some people might not like this new system, because the combat is balanced around having these new perk point enabling special abilities and it in turn changes the tactical gameplay towards ""gameyfied"" version of the old Jagged Alliance formula, but trust me on this: It just works!

It's clear the developers took a long hard look at the modern XCOM series and decided it's the spice that'll make for a fun game, but they put their own little spin on the formula. The game, from the outside, looks like XCOM, but it really isn't like XCOM once you play it. JA3 offers a lot more freedom in your approach to combat instead of making every fight a puzzle you need to complete.

The turn based combat favors the intelligent use of weapon specific actions such as ""Run And Gun"" where your merc moves forward and fires at the closest enemy on each step on the way or ""Pinned Shot"" which will mark a target on the field and then put a bullet in their brain next turn. Some weapons inflict bleed for example and others pin them down.

Different bullets cause different effects such as bleed or expose the enemy for further attacks and it's vitally important to know which body part you aim for. Shoot the legs of enemies with short ranged weapons and in the arms if you want to reduce the accuracy of their shots.

Getting wounded is less punishing than in the previous games for sure, which can take a while to wrap your brain around if you're so used to how Jagged Alliance 2 worked, but the new system brings with it a tactical element that was almost lacking from the older titles. It's simply put tons of fun to play if you can manage to suspend your disbelief just that little bit. It even allows you to build ridiculously fun character builds such as a pure melee fighter who is a beast with a knife. Something like this just wasn't possible in the previous games and you were shooting yourself in the foot if you tried playing a knife expert for example.

In the strategic map you still manage multiple squads of hired mercenaries, assault enemy positions sector by sector and capture mines that provide you with income. Just be careful as there's a limit on how long you can run one campaign, as the diamond mines that produce that vital cash flow for your operation will run dry over time. This forces you to push forward in a reasonable manner. If you take it too cautiously, you'll run out of money, which will seriously hamper your ability to successfully complete the game. It is not however impossible to do so with just one merc.

There are tons of gun for you to find and use, ranging from your standard browning pistols to rifles like M-14 or FAMAS. Almost every single one of them can also be modded to hell and back. There are no shops this time around where you can buy weapon attachments such as scopes and as far as I'm aware you'll not find them on the field either. But you can find already modded guns and equipment from the enemies you kill, in loot piles or you might buy them from NPC merchants.

There's a resource called ""parts"" which you get from dismantling weapons and gear and exploring the world. It's an abstraction of all things that you need to build new stuff. These parts are needed to build weapon modifications, bullets and also to maintain worn out gear. Some modifications require special parts such as micro chips for electronic devices, lenses for scopes and metal pipes for barrel enhancement. It's a simple system, but damn I like the simplicity. It allows you to mod any weapon on the fly as long as you're not in combat.

Guns have different statistics and modded parts further add new effects to them such as higher aim bonuses, longer effective range, lowered action point cost for shooting the gun and increased accuracy while prone or when the weapon is mounted. They can change the reliability of a gun, increase the magazine/clip size, change the way you want to spend action points while shooting the weapon etc. etc.

All in all the things you loved about the older games are there, but in a different way. The game is somewhat less simulated, but in doing so, becomes more flexible. Though there are some things I'm not so hot about.

For example, the animations are in some parts really pretty to look at. The enemies have great dying animations, the violence is there and the characters move beautifully as they rush from cover to cover, sliding along the mud or rolling over obstacles. But the same care hasn't been put towards other important visual aspects.

Out of combat mercs run like somebody lit a flame under their arses, like spooked ducklings and there's no way to tell them to slow it down unless you tell them to crouch. They always move in break neck speeds and I can't count how many times I've accidentally ran too close to the danger because of it. The throwing animation for knives is laughably bad as well. And there's no reaction to explosions. No knockdowns or anything like that.

There is no automatic pause for stage hazards either. If your merc spots a mine on the ground and says ""Hey, I've found a mine!"" he will then continue running directly into it like an idiot. The game doesn't pause so you could give a new order to avoid the mine or maybe even disarm it and it doesn't make the merc automatically avoid the mine either.

Enemies are also psychic and always seem to know where your team is hiding even if there's no way for them to know.

Then there are all sorts of little bugs and issues and various QOL issues that the devs need to address at some point.

Overall though, the game is the best Jagged Alliance has ever been outside of 1.13 mod for Jagged Alliance 2 and well worth your money if you like this type of games.

You can truly feel the developers love to the orginal installments in the series and care to bring the joy to next generation of gamers.

It's time travel to early 2000's and I feel like 15 year old again in front of CRT monitor, with Warren Zevon's ""Roland the headless thompson gunner"" playing in the background with some junk food all around. 

What's really great is character design - they're exaggerated, lines are cheasy and everything has this unique flavour of 80's and 90's action movies. However it might be hard to swallow for people who don't like the genre. Gameplay is hard and pace is slower than in modern approach for turn based tactical game. I had a great time combating one of the snipers in second battle of campaign - it was tense, long and I was constantly reloading the game. It's hard game but at the same time you're only punished for your own mistakes. Kind of ""you made it wrong, try again"" approach. At the same time, there are many ways of achieving goal of the mission.

The game has both streamlined and made simpler some of the game mechanics, for both good and ill. You are still a mercenary company working to take over/liberate a small nation for a client, and you still hire mercs based on income from a resource site, but there (so far) isn't an Internet site to order weapons from nor is there as much to do on the Internet as the last game. 

The turn-based combat meanwhile is better in a lot of ways, though harder to understand at first, as the UI is quite different. Gone are the overly long turns from Jagged Alliance 2, the weird interrupts, the overly slow pace of movement, and instead we have an X-com-like with several layers of complexity. How you build your squad affects your playstyle quite a bit. 

The music is great, the sound as well. Graphics are pretty standard fare for a Unity game. 

As for negatives so far, I can say that some of the UI is still obtuse, the tutorials are not as helpful as they could be, there's some slight performance issues at launch and the game can drag a bit at times (could really do with a speed-up on animations once you've played a bit). 

But overall, a great and fun continuation of the old games for new audiences.

JA3, on the other hand, merges XCOM combat into the JA2 theme - and that's the perfect combo, in my opinion.

This is an early review when I haven't finished even half of the game yet. But so far, so good. The game runs nice and smooth, looks good, and plays fantastic. I'm experiencing the same excitement as when I first played JA2 - more than twenty years ago.

Edit: I don't like the fact that this game has no shop to buy equipment/supplies that you're in need. Every JA game had a shop to use your money on, but in this game you only ever use the money to keep your merc contracts.

And every resource seems to be finite somehow, Meds are only available through scouting unexplored sectors, and they yield very little, if you've got a squad full of wounded mercs, it's your problem and the game doesn't care.

Weapon and ammo drop seems totally random, you can either get very lucky to get powerful rifles early on, but have the very bad luck to not drop ammo for your primary guns. Planning ahead in this game seems pointless, it's all about adapting to the circumstances and I personally don't feel very confortable playing this way - so I downloaded cheat mods so diamond mines never run out, meds drop 5x and ammo drops 3x.

Remember in JA2 you could place Shadow in bush behind one guy talking to other, order your sniper shoot one and order Shadow to slice others throat in one simultaneous action? Forget it, no such planing is available. You can't pause the game, issue orders and enjoy the show.

- NO AMMO. You can't buy it. You can't loot it. You can craft it with explosive perk in some villages... IF you somehow manage to loot gunpowder. Good luck with that.

- UNBALANCED ENEMIES. Local thug that can take half of machine gun belt into his bare chest is not fun. After that he run half of the map toward you and mince you with a knife. Impressing, can i hire him? This kinda force you to play meta - give everyone silenced Gewehrs with +3 aim scopes, sit in one place and headshot them one by one, while they run to you.

""Major"" boss fight got me frustrated. Bunch of enemies can't be gased with mortars or teargas, can't blinded with flash bangs... Really? You can't make fight balanced any other way, so you made enemies immune?

- NO EQUIPMENT ON MERCS OR ENEMIES. ""We put a lot of work into characters design"" - Oh, shut up! You either lazy, or you could't reliably implement dynamically changing characters models, and started inventing excuses. If i could see that enemies wearing armour i could plan my actions, prioritise some enemies, e.t.c. 

Seeing my mercs evolve from tank top and swimsuit wearing trash to kevlar encased killing machines... or enjoying same ""character design"" whole game dozens of game hours?

- ENEMY AI. One situation git me confused. While cleaning Fleetown, i hid all my mercs in a closed shed on the edge of the town, and went with my best sniper killing enemies one by one from the stealth from the opposite edge. Obviously thugs knew direction they get shot from, and moved toward my sniper. But on third round they by some miracle knew where my other team is hidden without  them moving/shooting/doing anything. WTF?

- NO LOOT. I already talked about ammo, but overall loot system is pure crap. Developers replaced looting attachments with shitty crafting, so no more reason to loot tons of guns. Lootable guns are rare, good lootable guns almost non-existent, so you ended up running with shitty guns that mercs arrived with first third of the game. And you can't buy guns.

I sank good times to play this.
Performance wise, if you turn the Reflection HIGH, the battle will run 45 fps at Ryzen 7600, RTX3060Ti, 1440p. It is around 85 at MEDIUM. Also it includes XeSS which is more superior to DLSS2.
Maybe it went Ray Tracing or something at high? Idk.
Less shiny at Medium, but i'll take it.
And oh i'm using ultra texture.
The map design of the game is a masterpiece.
It is a work of art.
You can't see better shiny dirty slum which makes you sad and happy at the same time at another game.
You're looking to a dirty puddle on the dirt road. It is raining down.
You can see reflection shining from it. It is dirty, a lot of trash in it. Idk, it is beautiful.
Usually the game like this, like X-COM, or Troubleshooter doesn't have much detail on the map.
The camera however is finicky. It forced us to see the 1st layer, and have to rotate a lot to find hidden objects.
For you're asking, this feels Jagged Alliance to me. Pretty much.
I've played some titles from JA2 onwards.
If you just ignore nitty gritty from the loyalists of the old.
It is not just about the game mechanics. But the feel, atmosphere.
As an epic western RPG.
The BGM is also epic, i love it.
As for the weapon, i think most people will stick to Sniper rifle right now.
Not actually a sniper rifle that thing doesn't exists, but a good precision rifle.
So if you see a weapon with high single target damage, that's probably it.

Once I found out there is going to be serious try at reviving the series I was equal part happy and worried. Happy, because games like that are very few and worried because most of tactical RPGs follow the xcom formula (which isn't bad, but jagged alliance formula is quite different - moe on that later).

Now for the game itself.

THE GOOD
- Amazing soundtrack
- Very impressive map design (individual sectors are big, realistic playgrounds)
- Nice graphics (although devs could work on optimisation a bit more)
It mostly runs well on my (near high-end) hardware, but some areas are frame drop sinks, I am sure this will be solved in time.
- First minutes captured the feeling of old JA quite well, the merc, contracts, all that familiar jazz.
- Stealth mechanics are surprisingly well done (compared to the rest)
- Story is so far OK and I like the multiple choices you are presented with

THE BAD
I expected the certain ""modernisation"" (read simplification) of game concepts, this is unfortunate reality of modern gaming. Some games manage to do it well, some do not. I think JA3 is the latter. Everything that I list below is an instance of conceptual simplification (of game mechanics) compared to JA2, and why is it making the game worse.
- Inventory system - way less space for equipment for each merc, In this game you have two slots for weapons (quick swap in combat) and 3 places for gear (helmet, vest, pants). Want to wear NVGs with your helmet? You can’t, 
- Weight management - JA2 system made sense, each merc had backpack with limited space + you had to manage how much stuff have you loaded them with so they werent winded after short sprint....that gets me to:
- Stamina/morale management - People get tired during combat, very much, JA2 reflected that, JA3 reflects tiredness due to traveling. Not the same. Morale changes so quickly, you would think that you work with bipolar patients.
- Gunplay - JA2 had its flaws (accuracy rating for weapons), but it wasnt all over the place with various stats like this game is. I mean, in reality ultimately the used ammo calibre governs what the gun does. 
For example beretta 92f, glock17 both shoot 9x19 bullets, handling is a bit different and accessories/maintenance also. Why the hell should one have a better ""crit chance"" slapped on in? Also, in what universe has AK47 same effective range than M14? 
- Communal backpack - is that like a pair of sleds each squad pulls with them? Was it meant to make sense? It is meant exclusively for ammo and crafting parts, and is shared between mercs in combat (no individual magazines in inventory slots/backpacks)....I refuse to elaborate futher due to risk of aneurysm.
- Sector stash - things you left lying around (or stored for future use) in various map sectors. First off, some sorting mechanism would be nice. Second, it makes sense for things to NOT teleport from sector to sector (they doesn’t), but you are somehow able to (with no merc presence in said sector) disassemble things into parts which TELEPORT into your shared stash.
- Crafting - oh by the holy McGyver, steel tube and parts into suppressors, parts and lenses into high-end optics, parts and chips into thermals and red dots...all of that in the jungle with no workstation, amazing isnt it? Another amazing thing is that everything you craft is EXCLUSIVE to the weapon you modify this way (you cant detach and attach on different weapon). You used to find these attachments (and other gear) on other weapons in the field (in JA2), or you straight up bought them through ingame laptop website, delivered to airport inside warzone. There is no such shop in this game. 
- Squad mechanics - Apparently moving mutiple squads together between sectors is impossible. Get good in fighting with 6 mercs max. 
- Scatter mechanics - Oh ye mighty xcom influence... This piece of mechanics make carefully planned ambushes pretty much pointless (without abusing overwatch). More so because third of enemies are sprinters with a machette ignoring your gunfire and going for your scalp like it is on black friday sale. 

THE UGLY
- Mercenaries skins - nevermind some characters have cartoonishly bad outfit that screams the opposite of ""warzone gear"" (looking at you Hitman, Livewire, Mouse and I am sure others I havent had the pleasure seeing yet), in the year of our lord 2023 you are stuck with the same equipment skin the whole game. If you put heavy explosive ordinance disposal vest on merc, they will not look one bit different in game. This is a concious choice by the developers (to  give individual mercs more charachter and 80s action hero feel) I understand. But pretty much every game gives player the choice, why am I stuck looking at Hitmans inconspicuous white pants and purple shirt?
I know some people will say ""Jagged Alliance 2 was exactly the same in this aspect"", first of all, in base game the skin at least changed with application of camo paint, second - it is a game from 1999. Modders managed to fix this later. Somehow I dont think they will do that in this case.
- ""Special"" skills - again, I think infulence of new Xcom (and Wasteland) games is palpable here. not a fan. For their price (of APs) some of them are incredibly overpowered.
- No in-game economy - except balancing your mines income, few bucks for traveling, training milita and your mercs paychecks. There are no vendors, there are few street stands selling usually overprices items, but that is it. You have no means to sell items you do not want, or buy yourself some high-end gear (JA2 had Bobby Ray website where you could do just that and few vendors you met inside the world actually had more than one item in their inventory AND you could sell stuff to them, what a novelty).

In conclusion

There are (and I dont doubt there will be) more things to list here, but I think you get the picture. There are far too many negatives for me to recommend the game (AS A NEXT INSTALMENT OF SUCH LEGENDARY FRANCHISE), yet it is far better than what we got in few instances inbetween JA2 and now. Influence of Xcom and Wasteland games on development of JA3 was apparently very heavy and it shows. 
I belive for tactical/strat RPG fans jagged alliance 2 is still much better experience overall (and dont get me started on 1.13, but that could be daunting even for veterans).
By itself, this game is fun at times and if I were to rate it as such, I would give it probably around 7/10, but since it tries to build on legacy of legends, real rating is lower.

TL:DR
This game is at its core an attempt to revive one of the best games of this genre (though I suppose the previous game is its own genre). Unfortunately devs didn’t fully grasp the formula previous games were made of and mixed in a looot of mechanics and specifics from other games, oversimplified the rest, resulting in something most of us ""old boomers"" (read 30-40 y.o.) deem way easier than 24 year old game",1689528321,1689751047,False,6,0,0.58468174934387207,0,True,False,False

This is probably a good game for someone. But for a veteran tactical player, this is just crap.

Like, oh, defending Port Cacao City it get to learn that the overwatch cone doesn't extend the full visible length during fog? Well that's two hours of my life I can't get back as I restart again.

When you do win a battle, sorting through the trash is just a slog. 

And when you don't -- the Caco City, for example, fight takes hours. Sure, you could set up a neat ambush, but then the game would have to allow you more than thirty seconds to set up. And the AI loves to just hide. One guy, just hides. After killing dozens. There's no morale break. He chills out and waits for you to make a mistake. He loves the tedium. You just have to sweep the map. Which wouldn't be bad, except he can still kill you, so sweeping becomes existential. Like, you carefully spend half an hour to find two guys standing behind a jeep, who seem to be inactive, and then you learn there are still more passives out there. Seriously. Turn 22. Carefully sweeping. Finally find the idiot. Now that he's seen, bulls-eyes poor Steroid and kills him. No indication of where he is hiding, noise, etc. The AI just sits there.

Enslaving the native population making them mine diamonds is my jam
You even get to kill commies

Perfect game really except:

NERF AI RPGs. from sniper distance they can accurately shoot with rpg? Absolute joke

Include acc % in the base game. No, hiding it doesnt make the game better. It makes it worse.
Include enemy health in the game. If you shoot a guy with helmet he can tank at least 2 sniper shots. No joke. m24 round to the head, no big deal helmet is kevlar you see strongest material in the world. Absolute joke.
I get what they were going for, RTS squad shooter. Sounds great problem is, they took out all the good parts about turn based shooters AND STILL they made a turnbased shooter game. If you are going to make a turnbased game why would you take out all the parts that make turnbased games actually playable? Insanity

Weapon and equipment condition falls far too quickly compared to how long it takes to repair them. You hire mercs to invade and kill enemies, instead you will spend 5/7 days of the contract healing, repairing and crafting ammo. Fun right? No. it isnt. Annoying af

Exit combat when there are hidden enemies on the level only, why am i running around this map taking turns when i have no idea where the enemy is wasting my madafaking time

Reduce medical costs at hospitals. 40k to heal what is this USA without insurance?
Also reduce medicine costs for healing. To fully heal a group it will cost 100+ medicine hell sometimes even 150. In one sector you can find maybe 10 medicine, yet you get into combat pretty much in every sector and take damage so that 10 medicine will go to that. constantly running out of medicine, parts and ammo and at the same time the legion will send suicide squads into you taking up more resources. The game just becomes a chore to play, im trying to explore the world and do side quests but oh no, the legion just sent 10 more guys with no equipment better go fight them. So boring, instead of progressing I have to do endless busy work so that I don't lose captured territory. And you cant recruit militia at ports so that doesnt help either. No. Playtesting. Guaranteed

Auto resolve is also completely useless because the game seems to think 5v5 is bad odds for you regardless of equipment. It makes no sense, you are constantly fighting at a numerical disadvantage and do fine but auto resolve is so garbage that every fight at least one merc will be dead or close to. You have to fight every fight, no matter how mundane and easy it is. The game becomes a chore.

Increase merc cap to 18 from 15, max group size is 6, why is the cap at 15? To have 5 5 5? Why not 6 6 6? Doesnt make sense.

Remove mine depletion. Artificial timers suck sorry to say. If i want to waste my time why do you care

Repair damage to buildings after combat ends. Every time i have to fight at a certain port all the buildings are in tatters there is no cover to use and it makes the combat annoying

Allow me to buy ammo. Crafting ammo is gay.

Make every bullet have the same damage. Why would burst deal less damage? It makes 0 sense. 

ADD A PAUSE BUTTON

Refund AP cost for move that begins combat.  Getting the first turn is completely pointless when the guy who takes first shot is always going to be out of AP

Allow me to trade items between merc groups when they are in the same sector. It is annoying to switch a mercenary between the groups to ferry over items to other groups.

AI abuses vertical positions somehow, if they are on a roof, they can nail you straight through it with 100% accuracy when you have no vision. Same when they are below and you are on the roof. Something is wrong with that it doesnt work properly

The camera is really wonky when it comes to switching between floors, and it keeps doing it automatically which sucks as well especially during combat but even during exploration when im trying to get the mercs to a higher floor it is really annoying. Fix? LET ME ZOOM OUT. That easy

Give veteran mercs proper equipment when they firsts spawn. Giving them the useless beginner pistol makes no sense when they are being paid 10k a week. Why am I scavenging for gear when I just paid 100k to get these mercs??? Why is their starting equipment worth 10 dollars??????????????? Completely insane stuff im witnessing did no one play test this game??

On the topic of pistols, they suck. The only good pistol really is the desert eagle chambered in .44, high damage quite accurate and easy to get ammo. Submachine guns are also completely garbage. ARs are also shit because the burst fire mode is broken. There is no reason why you should use a AR burst with low accuracy to get 80 damage hopefully when you can pretty much guarantee 80 damage with a sniper headshot with high accuracy. The AP cost is the same.

Basically 
Pistols=Useless (excluding DE)

Submachine guns=Useless (literally no exceptions)


AR=Quite useful but Snipers are better so if you have ammo use snipers.

Snipers=The best weapons. Use little ammo, accurate, high damage. Always use snipers.

Shotguns=Sadly quite weak. Even in big groups you at most will deal 8-16 damage which is garbage. But, they will pretty much always hit the enemy so they are useful against enemies that are very low. 

Grenades=Also really good. In fact grenades are in reality the most powerful weapons in the game. Barry gets shaped charges every 168 hrs that deal 60-80 damage to a large area. Barry is in reality the most powerful merc just because of his high explosive ability and that speacial skill. Other than that, RPG is OP but the ammo is hard to come by so no can do. 

LMG=Also the best. Problem? Ammo is hard to come by and so is gunpowder. This means if you use LMGs you WILL run out of ammo. This makes them in practice obsolete. Maybe you can have one group one guy using an LMG but thats it. Otherwise you will run out of parts and all the gunpowder which you need for sniper ammo (7.62 nato and 39)

S-TIER: 1894, Desert Eagle, AA-12, Shaped charges, RPG, Minimi, M24
A-TIER: Dragunov, M1014 shotgun
B-TIER: FN-FAL, Geweher 98, RPK, Grenade stick
C-TIER: AK, Auto-5, M-14, Galil
F-TIER: Literally everything else

Also the legendary variants are good, especially the .44 rifle you get at the very start. It is probably the best gun in the game for its low AP cost for high damage. 

Also best group from banter point of view:
-Steroid, Fox, Kalyna, Grizzly, Wolf (Mouse if you want to have 6 people but this means one group will have less than 5 people. Athough practically 0 explosive knowledge even with mouse, so you would need to have the 6th member be either Barry or Red or Fidel)

Also good is:
-Hitman, Raider, Raven (Other two-three Idk, Fidel/Red and Thor)
Although I wish there was more banter tbh. Far more

Another note, I keep reading in discussions about how one guy with LMG is able to mow down 20 guys in one overwatch. What the F are these people talking about? I have 100 marksman guy with set up on the ground with LMG and with one minimi burst to a vested enemy assuming he hits the enemy? Maybe, 40 damage. Sometimes 30 or less. He deals around a third of damage to enemy. So how the fuck is this guy supposed to be OP exactly? yeah hes better than the AR guys, and in terms of AP cost he deals more damage than sniper but vs vested armor guys hes quite garbage, not even enough to get a single kill. Maybe if you set up 2 people with overlapping OW, or maybe 3 people with OW overlap LMGs, but the amount of bullets that would costs is immense you would run out after one fight, just not feasible

Honestly I played it for like 30hrs but i wont be finishing maybe if they completely rehaul and balance guns, nerf enemy RPGs and LMGs, the way the enemies invade your territory, equipment degredation and costs but Im doubtful. It just becomes tedious. Maybe if you get it for 10 bucks it might be fun for a while, but actually finishing it?

The setting, whether it's Metavira, Arulco, or now Grand Chien, are like sandboxes. The mercenaries are like wrestlers. This is a tactics game, but it's also very much a game about picking a bunch of very broad characters and throwing them in a ring together to see what storylines develop.  

The tactics are good enough. I'll be honest, I'm not here for top notch tactical battles. I keep the difficulty normal and the load button handy because while it would ruin the game if I had to execute everything perfectly to proceed because the joy in this game is when things get messy. You want to hear the voice lines when your merc is downed, even if you are just gonna reload because that hit was BS. Hearing Livewire say her dad told her it would end this way, so please don't tell him he was right is just good writing. Even after you reload, that's something you know about this character and it colours the rest of your interactions with them. 

But whether you're making a team of cool, calm, collected experts and that one guy who is way too enthusiastic about explosives, pairing off your favourite couple to see if love can bloom on the battlefield, or pulling together the league of extraordinarily divorced gentlemen, the squad you run with in Jagged Alliance will have so much more personality than almost any other tactics game because it rides the line between having a character who is a protagonist and has a fully scripted story, and having a sketch of a character with just enough flavour for you to have your own journey with them.

Firstly, any comparison between JA3 and JA2 is both inevitable and a little unfair. Inevitable, because JA2 is still considered one of the best turn-based games ever made, and a little unfair, because after 24 years of dedicated players modding the game, the current version of JA2 you can play now is a behemoth. However, the developers of JA3 did miss quite a few tricks, which means JA2 still does many things better.

What I like: 
The graphics are crisp, and the story is fairly simple. 
There are a good range of mercs to play with, and some good systems like the IMP site make a re-appearance. It's nice to see some familiar faces in the roster too. 
The combat is decent, but could be better.

What I don't like:
The graphics, while good, are very simplistic, almost mobile-game like. 
The inventory system is utter garbage, and also did away with JA2's carry system where you could find different webbing and molle kits.
Enemy inventory drops are poor. Kill 6 people and get 2 items, tops? Even the base game of JA2 did better than that!
Using gun parts to build weapon mods is a terrible system and removes the joy of finding loot off bad guys.
There is less environmental interaction than JA2. You can't even shoot locks off.
There is no way to turn off vocal affirmatives without turning voices off completely. After a little while I was already sick of MD and Ice chirping away. 
The UI and controls are not very intuitive and a little annoying. Plus, using Q and E to rotate the camera is a terrible system. Where are my mouse controls, why can't I change that.

In the end, even if you were to look at JA3 as a stand-alone game, there are many better titles you can spend your money on. Wartales is epic, Battle Brothers will give you hundreds of hours of pleasure, a modded XCOM2 is amazing, or you could just get JA2 on GOG and install the latest mods.",1689713126,1689713126,False,2,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

[b] Interface [/b]
The interface feels like it was developed with the intention to bring this game to (small) mobile phone screens at a later date. You have to click through a lot of screens, each screen giving you only little information. It is also not as dynamic as you would expect, so you can change the armor of a merc and the apprearance does not change at all in the character overview.

[b] AI of enemies [/b]
Enemies are pretty dumb, they tend to run down the same path even if there is a pile of dead in front of them. They even run through fire of previously thrown molotov cocktails to unnecessarily catch fire just to run closer towards you... 

[b] Game balance [/b]
To make up with the previously described low AI, enemies are rather though. So you can  stand in front of them and they survive a burst fire with a AK-47 to their head .... this is unrealistic, even with a helmet. Throwing a grenade to an enemy does similar damage as a clear shot to their torso. 

[b] Gameplay [/b]
A lot of the newly introduced features do ultimately not add value to the game and are rather annyoing. Some are smaller, like mercs being ""offline"" in the A.I.M. database at the beginning of a new game (you simply start a new game if your desired merc is offline) or the renewal of merc contracts. Others are more annyoing, like the overwatch mode in combat which has to be turned on for every turn, the recovery, healing and repair of weapons which can only be done on the map by manually selecting the affected mercs. And last but not least the presence of many merchants in a village selling you exactly 1 item which attributes you can not even inspect before buying it.",1689497723,1689710511,False,6,0,0.54936671257019043,0,True,False,False

It is definitely a game that surpasses previous attempts to follow up on the legendary JA2, and can be considered a worthy successor, blending the best of 1999 with a modern approach to turn-based strategies. While the game lacks certain features, it compensates for them in other areas.

Pros:

- Turn-based combat: The combat system is perfectly executed and very challenging. Unlike the original JA games, it actually encourages the use of stealth, grenades, and heavy weapons, which seamlessly fit into the gameplay.
- MERCs: A fantastic selection of the most interesting mercenaries, each with their own personality and perks. Perks were present in previous games, but now they are more prominent and can be upgraded to a greater extent.
- Sectors and map: Beautifully designed sectors, varying in size, with a well-sized overall map.
- Abundance of quests: The game is filled with numerous side quests that are rarely black and white. The quests are engaging and add depth to the storyline, unlike any previous JA game.
- Campaign: The campaign is enjoyable and features several intriguing twists. Fans of previous JA titles will greatly appreciate it. Finally, a truly good storyline that you can influence.
- New UI: The ""Sat"" UI is great, and the timeline feature represents all upcoming events. Additionally, weapon repair, mercenary training, and squad movement are all well-implemented. It's not as polished as it could be, but very intuitive.
- Morale: Finally, morale actually matters in the game quite a lot.
- Stealth: It makes sense and becomes an interesting alternative for reducing the difficulty of capturing sectors. However, the enemy's vision range doesn't always make sense. Often, you can sneak right in front of them without being detected (why?..), but from behind, everything is fine.


Cons:

Overall, the game can be described as simplified in many aspects, for example:

- Limited weapon variety: The game includes very few weapons, which diminishes the sense of acquiring better gear.
- Inventory: I'm not a fan of the new inventory system. The concept of grid-based inventory based on strenght is fine, but I miss the weight of individual items and the carrying capacity of mercenaries.
- Tooltips: Many items lack important tooltips that would provide specific information about each item.
- Legion soldiers: It feels a bit forced, the tribal masks on the soldiers could have been left out.
- Lack of armor visualization: You wear a Kevlar helmet and pants, but the visual representation shows a t-shirt :/. I don't like this and it's quite a big thing for me.
- Militia: Having a maximum of 8 militia per sector is okay, but why can't they be moved from one sector to another? Why are all the same, they could have changed it a bit..
- Loot drop rate: The items dropped by enemies are often not appropriate. The drop rate should also be improved.
- Healing: The healing system is overly simplified. I like the idea that minor injuries can be healed, but major injuries should have a more significant impact on a soldier's behavior.
- Lack of animations: When you hit an enemy with an RPG, they just fall in place without any shockwave effect (even though a regular gun can do that).
- Camera: Occasionally, the camera can be confusing.

I might have missed something, but in general, most of the ""negatives"" are already addressed or will soon be addressed by mods that enhance gameplay. Vanilla JA2 had a massive number of issues, and it took time until the ""perfect"" v1.13 released. The game is enjoyable even without mods and provides a refreshing change that die-hard fans of the original games may dismiss, but those who give it a chance won't be bored.
A great successor indeed!

Here's a quick summary after 20 hours of part 3:

This game does many things right, and is a worthy continuation of what the first two were, and it does much of the things I expected of it back in 2000, after I finished the first game. I recommend it, not only when it is on sale.

Pros:  

-the spirit of the first two parts was honored, the mercs still have individual characters, albeit a bit different from part 1 and 2. One certain guy immediately complained about all the foreigners in my team and I hired him for it
-it has a lot more flair, the country feels alive, even more than arulco did in JA2
-it is as nonlinear as both predecessors, as soon as you leave ""tutorial island""
-there is a lot more quests to gain the people's trust, this is a key feature. after 2 towns, I have more open quests than were included in the whole of JA2.
-The game is challenging and money is tight. Just like it is supposed to be. I chose to start with commando difficulty.
-The humor is there, and it fits. I am not going to add spoilers here, find out yourself.

cons:

- The inventory is too dumbed down. This should be patched. Even a weaker merc should hardly be overloaded when carrying 4 different rounds of a certain type of ammunition. Also there are no magazines, only ammo boxes.
Perhaps it would be possible to include an option to use a simplified inventory for beginners, like it was included with the introduction of the complex inventory system of JA2 1.13
-the skillcheck system is too obvious, if the game tells me what to do, I feel like I am checking off a list. This could be more opaque
-Shops are too limited in their offering. I want a variety of guns I cannot afford, offered by a sleazy dealer who charges me way more than would be appropriate for their run-down garbage
-the in-game internet is a bit empty,  but it seems that this may also be patched.
-The antagonist is way less present than Deidranna was. But he is more present than Santino, so that's that.
-there is no, and will be no official language-pack. So I guess the fans will have to take care of that with mods.
-not all JA2 mercs made the cut, I miss Trevor for example. But these may be added later, so it's no big deal


I greatly enjoy the pros, and the cons are inconvenient, but they certainly do not ruin the game. Keep in mind: Jagged Alliance 2 was a buggy clusterfuzzle on release. Bugs that were present in the demo also appeared in the final release, for example the quicksave-quickload cloning of items. Compared to that, this game is very stable. I play on a dated gaming laptop and it performs well, only when there are many (and I mean more than 15) enemies present, it gets a bit choppy.

Although Jagged Alliance 3 did not meet all of my expectations, the game still has qualities that make it a good addition to the franchise.

In terms of gameplay, Jagged Alliance 3 does not disappoint. The overall mechanics of the game are solid and provide a pleasant experience for fans of the genre. Strategic combat remains the series' strength, with a variety of tactical options and interesting challenges.

The game's graphics also deserve attention, with a significant improvement over previous versions. The environments are well-detailed, the character models are sharp, and the visual effects are impressive. The immersion in the world of Jagged Alliance 3 is guaranteed.

In addition, the game's audio is excellent. The ambient sounds contribute to the atmosphere of combat, while the sound effects of the weapons are realistic and satisfying. The soundtrack complements the action in a proper way, increasing the emotion during the most intense moments.

However, some areas of the game are lacking. The destruction of the scenery, for example, was not implemented in an ideal way. The walls break easily, without the proper visual and physical impact. It would be more immersive if the walls were full of bullet marks before they burst, giving a more realistic and impactful feeling.

Another negative aspect is the lack of character customization options. It is disappointing that an elite ex-military unit, such as Thor Kaufman, is wearing flip-flops and looks like a hippie. It would be much more satisfying to have the possibility of equipping mercenaries with tactical suits and seeing these changes reflected visually in the game. This was a feature that was missing in previous versions of the franchise and its absence is disappointing.

In addition, the lack of an online store like in previous versions to buy equipment for mercenaries is a negative point. I expected that this option would even be improved in Jagged Alliance 3, allowing a deeper sense of realism to the game. It would be interesting to have equipment specific to operations in savannas, jungles and mountains, adding an additional strategic element to the game.

Another significant change in Jagged Alliance 3 is the humor. Previously, the series was known for its serious tone, but now it has a more childish humor. This change may have a negative impact on fans who appreciated the more serious approach of previous games. Jagged Alliance 3 had the potential to be the best of them all, but unfortunately it did not manage to surpass the impact of Wildfire, which for me remains the best.

Despite its flaws, Jagged Alliance 3 is still a good game that is worth exploring by fans of the series. With its solid gameplay, impressive graphics, and immersive audio, it keeps the essence of the franchise alive. Let's hope that future updates and improvements can further raise the level of this new approach, bringing the Jagged Alliance experience to a higher level.",1689623669,1689704254,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I could force myself to play this more but it's just not worth it.
I’ll ramble a bit here so if you expect a solid review that’s not what you get here and not what you should expect from steam user reviews. 
These are just my feelings about the game.

While I can appreciate the ambition gone into this it lacks polish and fine-tuning and reminds me a lot of the COH3 release.
Good ideas here and there but none so great they make up for the general unpolished look and feel of the game.
That can maybe be addressed in a few dozen patches. 
So who knows this might be a good game in 8-10 years when they are done with patching and a few dozen community mods. That seems to be the trend lately.
Maybe it’s just me not understanding what to expect from a full price release anymore.

The thing that bothers me personally the most are the peashooter guns and explosives.
I've had enemies live trough a full auto blast at close range + a shaped charge in their face + dynamite exploding next to them.
They just took it and turned around and killed three squad members with their automatic shotgun next turn.
Or blast a guy just wearing an open jacket with your explosives expert with an RPG and he is just slightly injured. Huh? What kind of RPGs are those exactly? 
But then I have my sniper taking guys out with a single head shot from stealth with his Dragunow.
Oh so you are telling me bullets hit harder when you don’t expect them to hit your head? That makes sense I guess. 
Something is very wrong here. 
It seems like a multiplier being wrongly applied to the player mercs. 
The damage scale is all over the place and most of the time not in your favor.

This is further made very frustrating by the fact that there is no graphical representation of what mercs or enemies are wearing.

Blast a guy wearing no shirt with an AK salvo from close range and he walks right through it. Is that because he is actually wearing a body armor and the game just does not bother to have a visual representation for it or because of the mentioned pea shooter problem? No clue honestly.

Put on a heavy flak jacket and your merc still runs around in a bikini. 
No way to tell other then opening up the inventory as to who is wearing what item. 
Not even night-goggles show up.
Of course everyone knows for mercenaries gear doesn't matter at all so why have a graphical representation for it in your merc game. 
It's just tedious to point this out honestly. Have you played any of the previous games? Or at least looked at them? Did those very old games show body-armor and face paint or not?
Why would you not show your mercs equipment on them? 
Isn't that a major point of video games to graphically represent the underlying game mechanics? 
Isn’t that what makes and breaks a good video game anymore?

Maybe it's just me but I find that an odd choice while someone took the time to animate garbage in the ocean water. Why would you spent a second on that before representing your main characters properly? It's just honestly hard to understand and a bit sad.

Oh and did you know your hired mercs with captured diamond mines have no access to buying ammunition or guns?
I mean just come on guys. This was a feature many years ago.
So you are telling me I can hire mercs to conquer an island online but I can’t order ammunition?
Couldn’t they just bring it at least with them when I order them?
How did nobody in game testing point this out?

The turn-based combat is tedious especially when friendly AI is involved. 
They just climb up and down stairs and buildings just to make you wait longer without ever getting closer to the enemy or taking a single shot.
The turns take forever and ever this way.

There's no innovation here. 
You move one merc after another and god help you if one enemy is left on the other side of the map or there are AI allies. 
Again just tedious.

I just don't have the mental stamina anymore to deal with these design choices.
The core game-play loop grinds you down with frustration and endless waiting.
Oh what I would give for a real-time with pause JA4.

Turn-based always was the minimal effort for translating from tabletop or game-mechanics idea to video game I get that, but I had hoped after so many years we would have come further and at least see some innovation.

At least let me move all the mercs together when moving from one side of the map to the other in turn-based or at least let me speed up the tedious animations for the mind boggling stupid AI allies. Please why would you lock me in these endless rounds of nothing happening.

Have you played your own game at all? Do you feel like this has a well rounded combat loop or is it possible that you spent way to much time waiting for AI to finish climbing up and down a letter just to continue moving one merc after the other to the other side of the map to finally shoot the last guy.
Gotcha! As I said he’ll survive the RPGs, the shaped charges and the full auto blast.
So reload from combat start save and try again. It only takes 2-3 hours or so.

Honestly not a bad call from a financial point of view as it puts you right on the edge of not being able to refund the game. 
I guess well played guys. It seems your game-play loop is at least optimized for minimizing refunds.
It’s still not fun though.
I’m being dramatic but you get the point I hope.

I'll give you a thumbs up for trying though and a thumbs down for it being so tedious.
That leaves us at “meh” but a “meh” is a not a thumbs up is it?
So……
I guess I’m sorry but I just don’t like it yet.
I’ll change thumbs up if it ever gets less tedious. Just a bit more effort please. I’m not asking for much.",1689693558,1689693558,False,63,2,0.676919281482696533,20,True,False,False

Though the foreign language packaging confused me, the gritty graphics, memorable main theme, and deep strategic mechanics instantly drew me in. It was by far the most difficult game I had ever played, resulting in many defeats, yet for some reason I could not stop playing.

Jagged Alliance 3 brought back all those wonderful memories with a huge smile on my face, after I had waited nearly two decades for its release. The soundtrack evokes nostalgia, featuring some of the best compositions in the series. The writing exhibits charm and personality, while the artistic visuals capture the vibes of Jagged Alliance 2.

Loads to love and Positive stuff as well as hitting that big box of nostalgia for us long term Mercs. 

You got the great Merc Statistics. 
A new improved levelling up section with PERKS. 
Great graphics. 
New quotes. (Steroid! :p  )
Old quotes. (Steroid! :p  )
New Mercs to choose from. 
Modding Guns is a big MUST to defeat the enemies.
Stealth approaching. 
Glorious Sniping.
Quite a few different Grenades and decent throwing system.
Quality voice Sounds and music. 
Fluid Merc movement. 
Side quests/missions. 
Different and maybe simplified aiming system. 
Activities for your Mercs whilst waiting for your Healing like R&R  time(improves if there's a bar in the square area), Training other Mercs - set time with almost guaranteed improvements. 
Also Ammo making and Bomb making. Scouting, for INTEL for local areas, which can really pay off, knowing where and how many troops there are in adjacent sectors. 
Variety of enemies. 
LARGE Map. 
And the satisfaction of adding another enemy sector to your ever expanding empire. 

Yes, there's criticism too. Simplified ammo carrying. Smaller/different carrying kit. 
Quite difficult money issues (though I went with 10 cheap Mercs instead of the recommended 4 good quality mercs). 
Gone are the % of your aim hit/miss. With a simplified replacement system. 3+ versus 2- = probable hit.
Much less Mercs to choose from (but plenty of the old team is there). 
Photos to choose from in IMP are few & all TERRIBLE. 
But you can live with that and the other criticism for some great tactical strategy and logistics. 

Chuffed we still got the same save system (anytime!). That really helps. 

But the money system is tough. If you lucky, u will get to intercept some Diamond Convoys for some much needed wealth to pay your troops. And keep alert to some civilians offering clues or trade. 

Anyways, overall, as I said, thoroughly enjoying it (as long as I never run out of money, & I've been close! down to just a few 100$ a couple of times.

It's been interesting seeing it start off with mediocre reviews, but I think a LOT of those reviews are from die-hard fans of JA2 v1.13 that were never going to be happy unless it was just an absolutely faithful remake of that game.

I was a huge fan of the original JA games, but I also went into this assuming it would be it's own game, with that Jagged Alliance flair, and that's exactly what I got.

The game is more zoomed in than JA2, and if you really expect the gameplay to revolve around the same type of combat (creeping forward slowly and setting up chokepoints and drawing in enemies) - you'll be disappointed. I've heard some say (disparagingly) that it's XCom in a Tropico setting, and while that's not entirely accurate, you can see the similarities - and for someone like me that's not really a bad thing.

The UI takes some getting used to, and I'm hoping they'll polishing things up to be more intuitive. But as I keep playing, the game keeps growing on me. It's not going to be a cakewalk if you are frivolous with your money and ammo. Even on the regular/default difficulty settings, you can get yourself into trouble quick, which I really enjoy.

Definitely start out with a few cheap mercs, and work your way up conservatively.

Also it definitely pays to have a few experts at everything, even early on you can get a decently rounded party which includes a medic, mecahnic, someone with decent wisdom, and someone with good explosives skill (you can make your main character fill one of these roles too in a pinch).

The game is incredibly faithful to the series, the old and new mercs are great, the missions, levels, and exploration was rich and the dialogues were lovingly written and voice-acted.

It came out on Friday afternoon, and I devoted 62 hours to play, and finish, the game, interrupted by pesky need for sleep. I was done Monday night. Just one more sector. Just one more quest. Just one more fight.

[b]What a rush.[/b]

I cannot recommend this game enough. The voice acting kills it, the ambient music is great, the mechanics are incredibly Jagged Alliance, and any jank or oddity you might encounter is so minor, it pales against the love and soul that has been poured into this game. AA game design is the only place where quality and soul still unite, and this game here stands tall as a shining example of a sequel done right, with respect to the source material, AND the consumer.

Fair admittance: I have encountered one or two softlocks, and one hard lock. Each cost me about 5 minutes of time, as the rigorous autosave feature is more paranoid than I could ever be and allows me to do undo almost every step, from map to conflict, to sector entering, to combat start, and from turn to turn. Those three events stood out as the only noticable issue at all, which is mindblowing in this day and age. I guess I found one object that was set too deep in the floor? That's it? In the entire game? Other than that, JA3 came out intensely smooth and bug-free. What a novel concept.

10 out of 10, my personal GOAT (third in a row), and an experience I will surely dive into again with a different set of mercs. Each merc adds to the story, elevating the already meticulously, lovingly created lore and events to another level. It all feels connected, personal, and tangible. Who you bring decides how it plays out.

If Haerimont ever decides to sell expansions, you can bet they have me again. My faith in this developer and their capabilities is solidified to diamond levels. Incredible work by all departments, from the 3D assets, to the sound, to the narrative, the voice acting, music, gameplay, and even the 2001 era web browser, the crusty looking websites, are all... so, so good.

This is updated version of my issues list (first one was a bit raw):

- viewport movement is bad.
- - zoom SHOULD change angle. I want to see better something on the ground, I zoom in and I can't see cause the same objects blocks my sight. Zoom without angle change was like 10-15 years ago. It is very surprising how devs could have missed this, it looks like they are not gamers and didn't play games like JA.
- - The game has overview mode (O) which zoom out, change angle to see almost down and show some additional information. This is interesting but useless, it would be better to be able to zoom in/out between very close and overview mode with slow angle change
- - Also near the zone map movement of view is very limited, sometimes it is needed to rotate view to see something near the edge of map.
- Realtime mode is bad. Inability of pausing game when you want, or at least when you see the enemy like in JA2, is stupid. In JA3 switch to turn-based happen when enemy see your mercs and enemies has time to position themselves and even shoot. This is not RTS. The sooner we switch to turn based mode the better.
- - And btw the animation of shooting up when enemy see you is very annoying. It remind me modern XCOM. And modern XCOM is much worse than JA2. Devs should not try to bring XCOM into JA.
- Tactical maps are SMALL. Really small. It looks like some maps slightly bigger than others, but still not big enough to be interesting. They loads fast and I haven't noticed much graphics issues, except some bad fps during rain or sandstorm, so technically devs should be able to make maps larger, but they were to lazy to do so. What the point in bringing machine gun to the first village and be able to control it if it is placed like 10 steps from the map border? What is the point to put mercs in the middle of enemies in some quests? Just laziness and luck of imagination.
- Overwatch is not the same as JA2 interruptions. It is stupid when during your turn you can shoot like 1 burst or 2 snap single shots while in overwatch you do 3 bursts. In most cases it is better to put your merc to overwatch instead of trying to shot the enemy. It is unrealistic, it is boring and it is worse than what we had in JA2.
- Inability to rotate merc in place, i.e. rotate to look in particular direction. why? it is in my spinal cord that merc should look in the direction of enemy to spend less AP next turn to shoot him. I checked and when you merc turn to shoot is cost no AP, when you shot in the direction where you were shooting on previous turn it doesn't cost less AP. Devs simplified the movement and shooting mechanics making this game worse than JA2. Also JA2 had shift movement keeping the look direction, absent here.
- Loot stupid as before. Enemy could be with powerful gun but after killing him no gun, not even weapon parts. Btw if I'm not mistaken when you kill enemy in melee you have no loot from him at all. I understand that similar thing was in JA2, BUT we had stealing from dying/stunned enemy or just dropping weapon on the ground during stun. Nothing like this here. Again devs should actually play JA2 to know this. I didn't notice so far enemies which were dying unconsciously or be stunned.
- Militia is stupid. I had like hand guns and several SMGs, I trained militia, enemy attacked my zone, I see 8 militia with automatic rifles. They are more powerful than my squad. I'm not sure what armor they got but I wouldn't be surprised if they had all 3 light armor pieces. I understand that it would be annoying to have system like JA:BiA, but in JA2 we had several levels on militia and some weapon diversity. In JA3 there are 3 levels of militia which has the same gun and different armor.
- weapon abilities are STUPID. Like if you have SMG you can do run and shoot, or Mobile shot  for hand guns ( I think). This means that sometimes enemy will run through half of the map and shot you. Not because he had a lot of AP, but because of weapon ability. Which means that whatever clever plan you had, however carefully you place your mercs they WILL be shot. This is stupid!
- perks are STUPID. Many perks are strange, useless, not interesting. But there are some completely messed up among them. For example retaliation interrupt on miss or on hit. Which means, when enemy had such perk your mercs will be messed up dealing with him. Not because this enemy is experienced or rigged with weapons and armor, no, he just randomly got such perk.
- Mercs talks should have setting to disable it. I'm ok hearing them in dialog with npcs cause it is rare. But hearing same 5 phrases per merc all the time is just annoying.
- Sat map time sink is BAD. It looks like devs made game artificially hard to do with minimal wounds. Plus additional stuff like weapon repair, ammo crafting etc. Which means that you will spend a lot of time in the Sat map. The Sat map is the weakest part of the game, what the reason to increase time we have to spend there? Why not make ammo crafting and weapon repair instant? You have merc, you have mats, just craft it. And btw weapon condition loss speed is insane. Several shoots and -1% condition. Fix jam and -10% condition. All these crap just to increase time we have to spend on Sat map.

Some people might think that I'm to harsh to the devs. Maybe. But if they would call this game some other name I would say ""good try. not a JA2 but some stuff is good. nice job"". But they name it JA3 and brag about understanding that games between JA2 and JA3 are not good enough. They deserve all the hate they got for dragging JA name through the dirt.

The best way this company could have done is to release remaster of JA2, get knowledge of JA during this remastering, understand how cool it is and only then start working on JA3.

I would be glad to play in remastered JA2 with better resolution, better OSes support, maybe more settings, modes, some mod support etc while I would wait for the real JA3. And now I have to play in JA2 struggling with some issues, curse JA3 and wait that somebody else will get the IP and finally release good sequel.

It mostly feels like Jagged X-Com, but that's okay. However, it is far from perfect, and a number of things bug me about it. They caught the overall feel of JA2. I'm mostly enjoying it. The arc story is okay. It's the dumbing down of equipment and the UI that bother me the most.

JA2 (Mod 1.13+) is still a better game, IMO, but it also had a number of bad usability issues and many of the expansive mods that have been created over the last two decades are unstable with the older app and its memory limits. Not to mention its dated graphics. Simply getting it to run on a modern PC is challenging.

They dumbed-down a lot of the previous game in a number of ways. The oversized and non-scalable UI seems as if it were designed to be tablet-compatible, which means you have to scroll a lot.

[b]Gripes (Because that's what you remember most). Maybe they'll address some of these things in patches or DLCs, but a lot of it seems baked into the program, which may make modding it difficult.[/b]

- You can no longer coordinate arrivals of squads inbound to the same zone if they are moving at different speeds.
- I intensely dislike the weapon modification syustem. The mechanic is that you collect ""parts"" by salvaging junk and scrapping dropped gear and use them to build scopes, bipods, etc. from scratch on each weapon. These accessories are not transferrable between weapons.
- Thank goodness a modder has already overridden the nonsensical design decision to keep you from seeing the approximage chance to hit on an attack. Yes, someone thought it was a good idea to dumb that down. Because reasons. I guess.
- The inventory management is trying to be cleaner than the onerous JA2 system. However, it is too dumbed down. You can't filter the sector inventory window by item type, group like items together, etc.
- The graphics department made too many things 3D rendered. This is going to make modding in equipment difficult.
- There are no traditional merchants. Some towns have a handful of retailers who will sell you a limited number of the same item with a cooldown. Rarely are they what you want or need.

Ignore the folks giving thumbs down based entirely on ""I like JA2 better"" because - let's face it - they were going to say that no matter what. Nostalgia's a helluva drug. JA3 is a more than worthy successor to JA2. Jagged Alliance has always been 'XCOM with personality', and since the bar was raised with the XCOM remake, I think we can finally re-up that statement. The less said about the non-sequels, the better.

Is it perfect? No, of course not. The first nuisance was the lack of info regarding how close a merc is to becoming tired. I'd travel to another sector and some mercs would suddenly be tired on arrival. So quick reload, rest a bit, then travel, annnnd still tired. Trial & error until the unseen tiredness meter is low enough. C'mon game, just give me the info. Not a huge complaint since quality of life changes like this can be patched in.

With every iteration of a strategy game, I'm always interested in the refinement. How do you reduce tedium without removing depth? Well, on the success side, I love the idea of squad supplies. It eliminates the tedium of managing ammo on a merc-by-merc basis. No meaningful or satisfying decisions ever came from that in past games - it was just busywork, so streamline it. Perfect. On the failure side, landmines. I don't think too many people were saying ""Ooo, I hope JA3 has more maps that drag to a butt-grinding halt while I slowly duck-walk around the map looking for mines"". Seems like a missed opportunity to automate mine-sweeping (or just get rid of them).

So yeah, brilliant game with only a few minor complaints. The developers did a fantastic job of giving us enough change so it feels fresh, while also doing their best to appease the ""If it's not EXACTLY like JA2, I'm gonna have a pants-crapping tantrum"" crowd.

Strengths: 
- Strategic map is well thought out and fun to use. A definite improvement over the past iterations.
- Graphics are decent and get the job done.

Cons
- Combat rarely gives the player enough information to make an intelligent decision. You don't have any idea what your hit chances are for attacks, nor how much aiming is going to improve your chances. So the key decision you'll make over and over again during combat (should I aim this shot, and if so, how much) is one that you make blind. I've never liked that.
- A lot of the early game consists of both sides taking pot-shots at each other and missing. It's not as bad as the early game in the originals, since you can get rifles faster now, but I don't find it fun to play games where most actions consists of misses.
- Bad guys do not play by the same rules you do. They can run an extreme distance and still have the AP left over for multiple attacks. I hate this aspect of the game, since it makes planning impossible.
- Maps are smaller than the original, constraining what kinds of tactics you can try.
- I found the difference between easy and medium difficulty enormous. Easy was definitely too easy, but medium quickly became too punishing. The first two missions were a joke, but by The Rust, you're suddenly outnumbered two to one, and your opponents have better weapons and aggro in groups no matter what.
- The setting occupies a lame middle ground by not being as overtly silly/parodic as the one in Jagged Alliance 2, but also not a serious setting either.

That to me fixes all the concerns I had, and I expect this game to be great.  I am upgrading my rating to a strong 3 stars base, and 4 with mods. More and better mods might even bring that up, if such a thing were possible.

That being said, this is still a game where they call magazines ""clips"", and misuse the term ""point blank range"".   Where there is no pause button for positioning pre-fight, and diamond mines only run out after you capture them.  But still, nods will save us.



How I wish there was a middle thumb.  

JA2 but crisper combat, lots of strained not-really-that-funny dialogue, and annoying contrivances.  

Lost in all the fun gameplay is the fact that the person who is 'hiring' you to do this is flat broke, and you fund yourself.  A pretty dubious narrative.

If you're really eager to relive JA2 with a worse income model, be warned this is one of those games that calls magazines ""clips"".  You can extrapolate the rest from there.

this is not JA3 this is trash remake again just like the last ones. 
ill edit this as i go but lets start off with.
no shoting locks off to open doors or crates its not a thing. 
no interupts its all this overwatch crap/
no bobby rays you literally find vendors on the side of the street that have random crates and you get to pick if you want whats in the crate you dont even get to view it to know what all it is.
you do know ok ja2 was not real but the series was kinda based on reality 
handguns you got like 2 either pistol or revoler you dont get weapon choices like we had. you get a generic pistol or revoler. 
inventory system is trash. 
you dont find a scope and attach it to a weapon that hunting for upgrades is gone. instead you find weapons you dont want and scrap them for parts and then you right click on the weapon you want to upgrade hit modify and select the upgrade and for just parts you can build all the scopes and silencers you want. way to make it a hand me game.
militia system is trash you get 8. and its not like you can look down an area just random spots allow it.
put it this way 
not only have you ruined the series for me... i dont care who you hire next time or what you promise thats it this was the final chance ANYONE had to make a sequeal. im done with video games all turning trash these days.

It's a great game for those who enjoy turn-based strategy. I would personally rank it above X-COM just because I'm not a fan of shooting aliens and other unidentifiable enemies. Love the ""realistic"" aspect of JA, with it's subtle humor en quirckiness.

There are a lot of aspects where the game can be improved, like inventory (unable to scrap or sell some items), militia (unable to see how many there are in a sector without mouseover), overview camera (needs to zoom out more), vendors (very shallow system with just one lootable item per caterory each time). But the core gameplay of JA3 is solid and a LOT of fun. I've been playing for a few days now and the game has already treated me to a couple of all-night gaming sessions. xD

If I have to name one negative aspect of the game, I would say it just needs MORE.
- more mercs (interaction between mercs, traits and personalities)
- more I.M.P customization
- more guns, armor, mods, ...
- more use of the laptop (where did my website for buying and selling stuff go?)
- more meaningful use of email (some of the spam is kinda funny, but not very useful and the ""newsletter"" should have been something more graphical. Even an actual paper newsletter with some pictures and stuff would have been better than just sending a wall of text describing recent events).
- more NPC's with actual content (side quests, relations to eachother, meaningful choices, ...)
- more sectors (map feels kinda small, but I cannot say anything about the total length of the game just yet). I do feel the game is trying to rush me a bit by having the mines run dry VERY quickly. This prevents you from running multiple squads and exploring each and every sector.

I really hope there will be an active modding community (and not just people who put ridiculous, immersion-breaking characters into the game through I.M.P. Yes, I'm talking about you, Gordon Freeman).

Where the game missed the mark is in micromanagement.  They stripped away most of it.  The characters' outfits don't even change when you add/remove armor.  Instead of staffing key locations with player controlled mercs that you used to logistically resupply with ammo/armor, you train NPCs that you cannot control.  This adjustment from the originals was a big one, and a bad one.  It feels likes an ""accessibility"" decision, but it's a niche franchise, genre, and game so I will never understand those kinds of decisions.

Micro/squad management was a big part of the fun for originals.  Clearly, the issue is that they wanted gimmicky characters with fully voices scripts and interacting personalities.  In that department, they nailed it.  The characters are great, lines are funny and well delivered.  However, the trade off is the above mentioned issue.  I believe a better balance would be to train NPCs that you can customize, resupply, and control.  I also think that this is way armor is not displayed on the characters, so they can preserve their personas.  I get it, but I disagree with that decision.

Another big divergence from the originals is the fact that the map is not persistent.  So if I retain a squad at a point on the overview map, they will not maintain that position in the 3D map.  Every fight begins like an X-Com fight, all gathered together at a deployment point.  Some of my fondest memories of the old games was having a squad positioned on a rooftop, constantly fending off invaders, while shuttling supplies to them.  That's gone.  Now you have to start every match like it's a new event.  It makes it repetitive and grindy to defend, instead of persistent and engaging.  Instead of keeping an eye on a key location that you have staffed, and making sure they don't fall to the enemy, you now have to go into a formal ""You're Getting Attacked"" moment where you play it or auto-fight. 

In short, great game on it's own merits.  With the Jagged Alliance name attached, it falls short of the greatness it could be by stripping away important aspects that made the originals so great.  By no stretch is this a return to the originals, as they heavily advertised.  It's X-Com style combat (which I like) with absolutely zero customization (which I hate) and little to no micromanagement and logistics (which I hate the most).  It is, however, a competent, well made, and fun addition to the turn based strategy genre.",1689636128,1689636128,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's amazing seeing the old mercs again, and I love how they interact with each other. Some of the humor I don't like, but that's life. One doesn't laugh at every joke in life. Just like one doesn't like every game in life. I can't recommend the game. The gameplay is very arcade like, with many weird design decisions. 

This game has incredible HP bloat on its enemies. Don't be fooled by the enemies wearing jeans and facepaints, they shrug off multiple shots, and the face paints have steel mixed into them. The deadliest enemies are the unarmored machete guys. Guns don't hurt them, frustratingly you'll see them die only after happily taking 5-8 shots to the chest. A shotgun blast does not make them stop or fall to the ground, and they will just keep running and knifing your mercs. 

Did you think that you could move forward with one merc while providing overwatch with another? You silly player, that's a bad plan. Your merc on overwatch might hit the shirtless machete guy with three bullets to the chest, but he is still going to keep running all the way to your merc, only to cut him into tiny pieces while your group watches in dismay. If you're going to have overwatch then you put so many mercs on it that the enemy dies the second he enters those shiny blue cones. But only the cones, Lord have mercy on you should the enemy go around the blue cones. I'm all for making different playstyles viable, but this is just silly. 

There are no real shops from where to buy ammunition or supplies, only weird bazaars that offer 1-3 items at the time. Sure, you can craft ammo by disassembling weapons and turning them into bullets, but only if you have gunpowder, something that drops only if the game feels like it. (and how does that even work?) We can fly mercs in from halfway across the world, but can't buy ammunition or weapons the same way? To compound to this, most weapons are either locked on automatic fire, or there's no way to choose whether or not your mercs use single shot or burst fire when performing overwatch or other maneuvers. Your elite, disciplined commandos keep firing inaccurate bursts even if the enemy is on the other side of the map. And you don't want to use burst fire or full auto, since the game deducts damage from your gun when firing multiple rounds. Trying to save some mortar rounds? Tough luck, your mortar fires a three round burst. Period. You're wasting ammo and doing less damage. 

For example, a gun does 30 damage per shot. So, firing a three round burst does 90 damage right? No, it does 3x15 or some other nonsensical amount. This is even worse with machineguns. Imagine the fun you're going to have when your machine gun fires 8 round bursts, each of them dealing less damage than a punch. I'm guessing that this is a design decision, trying to create balance or whatever. How? Couldn't you balance your machine guns in any other way? And how is this fun? 

And don't get me started on the inventory system, or the X-Com style scatter movement your enemies get when you ambush them in the middle of the night, or how the battles are just small 6 vs 8 skirmishes on tiny maps. I could go on and on, and I've gone on for long enough already. You hopefully see my point. 

Yeah, the game would be ok I guess if I was looking for an X-Com clone. I came looking for a Jagged Alliance game, a tactical shooter, only to find that the mechanics that made the game fun for me have been torn out and turned into this mild, melee-focused arcade rpg.

They stated that the story isn't that serious, but it has a mix of elements from popular culture, movies, real life events/themes and so on that the story itself (so far in our playthrough and I won't go into details) is believable enough.

Initially I was sceptical about the combat when they showed gameplay videos. Some roleplay like perks that were funky like double grenade throw etc. But so far it haven't bothered me like at all. They are different but still kinda same as in JA2 1.13 perk wise. Giving emphasis on how your merc operates and plays on the battlefield.

One of the biggest things that I dislike (That they changed from JA2) is inventory system. You don't have any weight, but inventory slots that are dependent on your STR. So you can carry like 50 rockets or grenades or like 5 different heavy weapons with no issues. Repairing, weapon modding and healing are somewhat annoying. Repairing and healing being minor dislikes, but weapon modding is pain in the ass. Also some operations that you can do take way too long to perform, but whatever. Lack of weapon variety (and magazines)

But when Modding tools come I guess those things are fixed pretty fast.

Since game start im trying to get into it. I am really dissapointed how you can mess up a game with such old and classic roots. Its not even that hard. Like I thought i would get a far more depth inventory system like in JA1,2 and BiA just a lot more. Bot no. Inventory is reduced to fewer slots and you gotta use certain tools automatically now. You completely changed the nice mechanics. WHY? And why the fuck ist the inventory menu to big?  4 mercenaries and i always have to fucking scroll down. Why cant i have everything on one screen?

After the first little ""island"" i thought i would have tons of stuff looted not knowing what to do with it and what they are for. Simply nothing. A few crowbars, too much ammuniation even on the second hardest setting and the same weapons. All you gotta do on the maps is dismantle everything so you get ""weapon tools"". Thats it. Like why the fuck can i dismantle a tricycle and use it as weapon parts. WTF. Why not just find the weapon parts as they are. Scopes, Magazines, Stocks etc and make them harder to get? Thats so idiotic.
But the worst is just that the game is constantly crashing. Like really constantly. Every fucking 2-3 minutes. Sometimes it just closes. Sometimes i have blackscreens where i need to cold boot my fucking computer. 2 of 5 times it just doesnt stop loading into the safegame. I have to kill it over the Task Manager. And believe me.

It simplifies a lot of things that weren't fun for non-accountants who were fans of the originals. Sorry guys, the XCOM remakes are better than the originals for a reason. Not that this one is BETTER than JA2 per se, but the quality-of-life changes absolutely are by 1000%. 

There are A LOT of bugs. Quests getting broken and requiring a save/load, sectors being uncapturable, etc. However, they're mostly minor inconveniences; the game is still fun.

My only real beef is that stealth is pointless; facing direction doesn't matter, enemies see through the back of their heads, it makes the guerilla breaking-into-the-complex thing very frustrating and completely numbers-based. We NEED a pause button; the devs don't realize that bad controls do make chaotic gameplay but not at all fun gameplay.

Weapon balance is very poor currently, with automatic rifles and SMGs doing hardly any damage to the (unrealistically bullet spongy) enemies. Damage of grenades also fluctuates wildly, with a regular grenade going off at the enemies' feet doing hardly anything and directional charges resulting in instant dismemberment. 

The inflated HP of enemies also requires quite some cheese tactics to overcome, which is probably the reason why half the community finds the game too easy and the other half too hard: There are those who abuse ""overwatch"" and those who don't. Basically, putting a unit on overwatch to fire during the enemy turn instead of using your own turn gets you two or three times more shots fired for the same amount of action points spent. Cheesy, but unfortunately required to wear down the massive HP pools of even early game enemies. 

The game (both the global map as well as the tactical sector maps) are also far less open than what we're used to from Jagged Alliance 2, severely limiting replayability. There may be multiple approaches to most tactical maps, but there is only one optimal way and once you have learned that, there is little point in trying anything else. For instance, the surefire way to conquer the first town is hiding your entire squad on the town's only flat rooftop and setting everyone to overwatch the ladder up to the roof - repeat until all enemies have climbed the ladder to their death. Works 100% of the time with zero wounds taken. In fact, the enemy does not even get to fire a single shot.

The game could have been much better.
The UI is pretty bad to me, the trading system is one of the worst ever, this is like a loot spot with a price tag, no menu no inventory durng a trade, you just pay the price for looting a weapon from a vendor.

The action icon to activate something can be really tiny, you are barely able to click on it.
the looting icon, you must play with the camera, if you have something betwen you and the looting spot, you can't loot, you must have a direct sight on the looting spot, sometimes you can't even loot, you have the icon and all but you can't grab the loot TBH it happened only once for now.

the enemies they are using all kind of weapons, but when you loot them from  most to all of their weapons are gone.
I am still accumulating a lot of loot with no way to sell it, so this is frustrating. (maybe i am missing something, in the previous game you could do that) Well this is what i don't like in the UI, this is the same mess as JA2 with no imrovement.

The game gives this indication of ""be experimental! Lots of ways to tackle obstacles!"" but also offers 0 space to actually experiment with gameplay. Ammo and money are so restrictive (with so few ways to get either) in the early game that I feel it punishes any exploration in the game world and trying to figure out fun ways to play.

Additionally it's very poorly optimised. Getting just about 30fps on a GTX3070 on medium settings, with regular frame rate drops when anything happened.

Edit: I've given it another shot after the refund was denied.

I cannot recommend this game at all. It requires >2hours to complete the tutorial island and get a grasp of if the game is for you, at which point you're locked in.

Major problems:

1. The game gives no indication of enemy difficulties. The only way you can find out if an enemy group will stomp you, is if they stomp you. Wipe the game, start again.

2. This game gives no indication of income. Misjudge your income? Wipe the game, start again.

3. The ""unpredictable"" hit marker system gives very little information about the quality of your shots. I don't mind the chaos of it all, but I need to have some inclination. The highest level of aim marker looks like it's going to be a very high % shot right? Nope... It can still be a very low % shot.

4. Stealth is completely pointless. Steal attacks are highly disadvantageous due to rarely ever succeeding. Plus there is no indication of how visible your troops are, you'll just be dragged into combat suddenly if spotted and there's no way to tell what is risky or not.

5. Experimenting is punished in this game, and optimising is clearly the way it wants you to play...

It's been way too long since I played JA2, and I didn't play it THAT much, so I can't make a great comparison, but this is a huge improvement over JA:BiA.

I've been mostly playing coop, and while there have been some desyncs here and there, it's nothing that has ruined or stopped our playthrough for longer than a couple of minutes. Here's hoping the desync issues get ironed out, but at least in the meantime the resync process is easy and straight-forward and doesn't require re-invites or anything like that.

Full disclosure: I was totally out of the loop about the development and only learned it was releasing a few days before launch. So I took a hail mary and bought this primarily for the coop, and was basically expecting a mediocre Turn-Based Tactics game whose coop would make up for its shortcomings. But I'm glad I did, because it comes out swinging. It's got a lot of care and detail in places that often get overlooked in games like this.

Some of the action movie cliche stuff hasn't aged super well in terms of merc dialogue. It's supposed to be a little corny I suspect, that's part of the fun and some of the characters make me laugh, so it hits sometimes. But there's a few that make me wince even thinking about asking the voice actors to speak the lines. Woof.

But desyncs and cringy dialogue aside, genuinely fun and good quality game. Highly recommend if you're looking for a good oldschool TBT game with modern game standards.",1689619636,1689619636,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is Dutch Schafer, and I've got a story to share about Jagged Alliance 3, a game that takes us deep into the world of tactical warfare and mercenary operations. Now, just like my own encounters with the Predator, this game promises intense battles, strategic decision-making, and a whole lot of adrenaline. So strap in, 'cause we're going on a wild ride.

In Jagged Alliance 3, I found myself immersed in the world of underground operations and high-stakes mercenary work. It's a game that puts you in the boots of a seasoned commander, hiring a team of skilled fighters and leading them into dangerous missions across various volatile regions. Just like my own squad back in the day, you'll need to plan your moves carefully, adapt to the changing circumstances, and outsmart your enemies at every turn.

Now, let's talk about the gameplay in Jagged Alliance 3. It's what you'd call a turn-based strategy game with a focus on squad management and combat. You'll be assembling your team, equipping them with the best weapons and gear, and coordinating their actions on the battlefield. It's a game that demands tactical thinking, resource management, and a keen eye for strategy. Every decision you make can spell the difference between victory and defeat.

As I delved into Jagged Alliance 3, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia. The game captures the essence of the original Jagged Alliance series, with its gritty atmosphere and strategic depth. The visuals and sound design transport you right into the heart of the action, making you feel like you're right there alongside your mercenaries, facing the dangers head-on.

From my own experience, I found Jagged Alliance 3 to be a thrilling and immersive journey. It reminded me of the camaraderie and adrenaline-fueled missions of my days in the field. The game captures the essence of tactical warfare, where planning, adaptability, and teamwork are crucial for success.

So, if you're looking for a strategic and immersive experience, Jagged Alliance 3 might just be the game for you. It's got tactical depth, immersive visuals, and a gameplay loop that'll keep you hooked. Get ready to lead your mercenaries to victory, outsmart your enemies, and show them what you're made of. Remember, it's the ones who can think on their feet and adapt to the situation that come out on top. Stay sharp, team, and let's conquer the battlefield together!

Lists for lists sake
Pros:
+ Deep tactical gameplay with a wide range of strategic options
+ Immersive atmosphere and engaging visuals
+ Diverse roster of mercenaries with unique abilities and personalities
+ Well-crafted missions that provide a good challenge
+ Respectful continuation of the Jagged Alliance series' legacy
+ Good balance between planning and action

Cons:
- Steep learning curve for newcomers to the series
- Some players may find the initial stages overwhelming due to the complexity of squad management
- Occasional minor technical glitches and bugs
- Lack of significant innovations or groundbreaking features compared to previous installments
- Limited multiplayer options or replayability beyond the main campaign

A neither top nor flop but neverthleless negative to neutral rating from a JA Veteran & Round Strategy Enthusiast.

PRO:
1) JA Series Charme and Humor.
2) Decent actual looking graphics
3) Play feel catches JA atmosphere...

Contra: 
1) Stupid Interface & awful inventory decisions (Munition for Weapons at the bottom of a MUST SCROLL Menu - wtf?)
2) Bad Opponent AI (Still going the shortest way into your Line of Fire instead of using Map Geography
3) Poor Game Designs Decisions to compensate tactical shallow depth:
3A) No Weapons Selling / Merchant System & 
3B) No Cars but Enemies being mobile with boats causing GRIND and repeat)
3C) NO FUCKING PAUSE TIME in Realtime mode = Stealth Useless
3D) Tiny deployment zones on small maps
3E) No swimming
3F) Perk System can't be trained focussed as someperks are hard to reach before being able to get the points in skills before able to choose the perks
3G) Enemies cheat in HP, AP & all. xD
3F) Weapons and Loot System is weird. Can't deinstall  addons and add on other guns, enemy dropping almost no shit related to actions.

4) Repetetive Game Character animations and rather low interaction from characters with terrain (f.e. killed soldiers on the same spot falling exactly over each other)
5) Shallow Depth and repetetive lines in MERC interaction. Its's nice to have but way to few lines, I'm sorry... Missing the total random conversations. At least on Quests they add on some nice conversations.
6) Maps feel bit buggy here and there between graphic apperance and walkeability set up.
7) Many tweaks from JA2 1.13 no considered. BAD CHOICE.
8) Even while being fictive I wonder what POC say about the way the enemies is made up tribalish... 


SUMMARY: 
OFC is misses the depth of JA2 1.13. Theres no way it could have that considering the amount of time in production.
 
It HAS the humor. It has the feel. Just not too elaborated. Perhaps the best approach after all those years, which is a compliment to te designers and fans of the game themselves...
however it feels like there are so many possibilities to improve the game & so many addins have not beent considered or simply being cut off due to time and release date that I feel sad a bit....
Maybe they'll be added as DLC (hope not tbh, don't like to be milked for additions of what could have been in first release), or, much more likely, community will mod and add the shit and depth into it.

Some great moments:
- The IMP Test. Meet my dogs!
- MERCs like Grunty going maniac about decent splatter, hrhrh
- A ton of Arulco Game References

CONCLUSION:
For FANS of the Genre a little pulse of life and hope for a brighter future. For enthusiasts about Round Tactical Combat Strategy a little Snack. But thats what it is atm.

The merc personalities and interactions made JA2 stand out from every other game of the time, and this one retained that all-important feature.

What it forgot was that the game was fun.  This one is just a chore.  The enemy AI knows where you are, and immediately acts as soon as you do anything or are spotted.  There's no pause on tactical to get your mercs into position, so the odds are great that the first one you sent to position gets spotted before most of the rest are positioned, and then the enemy all take cover before you can do anything.  Mercs miss far too often, as in a merc standing right next to an enemy can miss completely on aimed burst fire, which is asinine.

Good:
- Merc control and combat mechanics are fairly solid
- Decent JA vibe (existing mercs, IMP, soundtrack, voiceovers, squad banter, etc)
- Campaign map play made easier, faster and more intuitive than JA2
- Reasonably fun
- Level design and tactical options for approaching combat
- Small QOL improvements over JA2 (i.e. team supplies section in inventory)
- Destructible environments

Meh:
- The command/browser/email view UI
- No vehicles
- Fatigue, stamina and weight/encumbrance systems either dumbed down or removed altogether along with multiple items related to them

Bad:
- No Bobby Ray's
- Mines run out, hence the game is essentially on a timer
- No M.E.R.C.
- About half the weapons selection of JA2
- About 2/3 the mercs selection of JA2
- Weapon attachments get destroyed if removed or changed so you have to hoard components until later
- Bullet sponge enemies taking multiple point-blank headshots to kill
- No customization for characters
- No armor displayed on characters (the entire conflict is fought by people in sandals and Ts)
- Ammunition is dumbed down and hard to find reliably (since there's no Bobby Ray's)
- Equipment is scarce and RNG heavy
- Stores are dumbed down to the point of ""click table to buy single item generated randomly every day""
- Since many systems have been removed, money is mostly useless except for paying mercs and is barely ever enough for that.

Yes. Very much yes.

These are my initial impressions (finished the tutorial island) after playing on the hardest difficulty (Mission Impossible) and Ironman settings:

STORY/WORLD:

This game is a true successor to JA2. 40+ voice acted mercs return from IMP. Some may point out there was nearly double those mercs in JA2, but the mercs here are all fully fleshed out with hundreds of unique voicelines that also comment on environmental/story dialogues. For instance, I thought twice about disturbing a war memorial with Barry, the devout Hungarian Christian and bomb expert. The humor from JA2 is still present—so yes, it's campy—but not to the point of being obnoxious. You might tire of Grunty telling you how much his mother would love your gorey gun artistry, but he was like this in JA2. Mercs will also comment on each other. Igor, the Russian merc, has made it clear he will find a wife for Kalyna, my Ukrainian sniper, after every crackshot she pulls off. These interactions bring the spirit of JA2 back. 

The world of Grand Chien is an amorphous post-French colonization Afro-Caribbean-esque world and the writing makes it believable. You'll meet village folk who give you your typical cRPG quests, but there's extensive work put into Grand Chien's unique characters (many of whom can become hirable mercs later). Still, this is where JA3 exceeds JA2. As much as Ira from Arulco was a fan favorite, she's comparably stiff to the honorable (but misguided) Pierre or the sleazy (and nefarious) Bastien. Decisions early in the game can drastically change future outcomes (especially with merc access) but JA3 will make it clear when your decisions have consequences. This isn't JA2 where the unwitting player gets Ira killed and then loses out on one of the more story-connected mercs in the game.

COMBAT

The combat is a massive improvement over JA2, but this isn't immediately apparent until you play on higher difficulties. First, all the basic mechanics such as burning more AP for a more accurate shot are here. jA3 wants you to believe the % to hit is gone, but I've still had my mercs caught missing point blank shots like an XCOM rookie. However, JA3 does make a huge leap with Overwatch and terrain obstruction.

The Overwatch mechanic is not XCOM2 where you will spend every turn trying to goad out enemies into a firing squad. JA3 uses cones of control whose range/width for Overwatch is determined by weapon type. Furthermore, placing the cone is IMPORTANT because your merc's line of sight MATTERS. Overwatch cones work best when placed in open areas to catch bad guys darting to and from cover. If you Overwatch cone an area with cover, it is very likely your merc will mag dump the cover instead. Still, Overwatch in this game is POWERFUL. It costs all of your AP to Overwatch, but any enemy activates Overwatch attacks both with movements and actions. Depending on ammo/weapon type, you may pull off multiple attacks un a single turn if your Overwatch is placed correctly. 

The Overwatch mechanic is intuitive too. Machine Guns give you wide, long cones (but take a while to set up). Rifles are narrow, but extremely long cones. Pistols, shotguns, SMGs are short/wide cones. Assault Rifles are a great medium between them all. This incentivizes a balanced merc squad to approach any situation and on the hardest difficulty YOU WILL NEED IT.

JA3 difficulty does not mess around. I didn't understand the ""outpost strength"" mechanic on my first playthrough and assault the first fortress with max defenses. Despite infiltrating stealthily, there were simply too many patrols. After being discovered, I was rushed down by 20+ heavily armed mercs including the personal posses of story characters who were present because I didn't complete the side quests. The AI does not sit back and let them shoot you. You will be flanked, rush, pipe bombed, bazooka'd, sniped, and machine gunned down by aggressive AI. They will still opt for cover where possible, but the AI isn't interested in holding back its numbers if they have the advantage. This encourages the player towards creative strategies like luring the Outpost's garrison to a blob near the only 'revealed' merc with your explosives expert in hiding just nearby. Speaking of hiding, let's talk stealth.

STEALTH:

I love JA3, but a Hitman simulator this is not. You'll see people complain that there's no pause for setting up stealth kills and while I'm inclined to agree, the simple truth is this game does not guarantee stealth kills. Yes, you can get silenced sniper rifles, and yes, you can stealthily pick off a garrison one by one. However, if you miss (and you WILL miss), the game activates a ""surprised"" turn-based mode. If you kill all surprised enemies within that same turn, the game reverts back to out-of-combat. As much as I rushed to build a stealthy ninja assassin character, it's important to recognize that stealth is meant to be a lagniappe (""a little something extra"") to the core combat. Playing into stealth mechanics might allow you to reduce a garrison exponentially before true combat begins or allow you to obtain a secured firing position. Conversely, getting caught is easy because you can't pause out of combat—and guards often patrol randomly. One stealther is doable in real time, but a squad? 

However, I'm okay with this. I love stealth mechanics, but any gamer knows that being able to fully stealth a zone subsequently trivializes it. I'd like to see the inclusion of possibly pulling off simultaneous stealth kills, but having the risk exponentially increase as a result is a fine tradeoff to me. Remember, however, that stealth is still incredibly useful on harder difficulties. You NEED good positioning or you're dead, so stay out of sight and make sure you're always taking the first shot.

Pro tip: If you're going to be a knife assassin man, you'll need high strength too to actually *hit* your target for a stealth kill, lmao. Rookie mistake I made.

GUNS:

JA2 takes the cake here, but the JA2 I played was the penultimate version which included a bunch of modded weapon kits. The gun variety/customization in JA2 was frankly overwhelming, but welcomed. JA3 does have a great weapon modification system that's simpler but more meaningful. I also like the ""on the fly"" crafting which allows you to dismantle useless weapons for useful parts to mod your own weapons without bugging off to the JA2 airfield. However, there is a part of me that's nostalgic for the XCOM-like equipment/outfitting that JA2 had. JA2 allowed for massive power spikes, importing in first world-weaponry to a war-torn third world backwater where only the elites had decent military hardware. JA3 is a more gradual incline. You'll start with pistols, WW2 weaponry, and AK-47s, but later in the game you'll see goons using more modern hardware. This could also just be a difficulty thing. My tutorial island outpost had a rampaging bazooka guy and I was already picking up rockets I couldn't shoot.

One pet peeve is you can't see your merc equip armor on their character. This wasn't a feature in JA2, but that was twenty years ago. The guns show up in all their modded glory, but as much as I'm fine with mercs dressing as their national stereotypes at first, it's goofy seeing them go into firefights with a t-shirt on.

FINAL THOUGHTS:

If you are worried that this is yet another cash grab under the JA franchise, then do not be afraid. There are weaker aspects to JA3 I was disappointed in, like the lack of expansion on the IMP (player-created) merc. It's a travesty seeing all these nicely voiced mercs, but our PC is silent and restricted to a single male or feminine voice. Even JA2 had more variety. 💀 But, my guess is this will be expanded on with a welcomed DLC later. However, this is a minor complaint and the game overall is very satisfactory.",1689613076,1689613076,True,4,0,0.554794549942016602,0,True,False,False

And I love JA3. Yes, it does have issues - it's not perfect but it is VERY Good. Really Really GOOD. It has formidable bad guys, loads of NPC's and side quests: interesting storylines and choices. A great number of old friends and faces from previous games. 

Probably not exactly for 1.13 fanatics also not for hardcore milsim fans - it has Jagged Alliance soul! It is a pisstake of 80s and 90s action  movies - with great banter and funny characters - combat is tactical but heavy on stats like in any good old school rpg - but far from being realistic.  

I could go through pros and con's - but others are doing it - for me there are two notable things about JA3 : 
1) its keeping the spirit and soul of Jagged Alliance series 
2) it doesn't have horrible Chance to Hit mechanics! - AWESOME",1689612100,1689612100,True,0,0,0.461095094680786133,0,True,False,False

Stealth is a joke. Can't tell what/where enemies can see. No pause function. Stealth shots are far from guaranteed even at point blank range. One guy noticing you wakes up the whole map and they come at you in waves.

Shooting is a joke. Enemies are bullet sponges to the extent that realism is laughable. Weapon ranges are significantly nerfed. Accuracy is awful and mostly RNG.

Ammunition is very hard to come by. Shops are RNG and I always have a ton of money I can't spend.

I think JA2, especially the 1.13 modded version, was the pinnacle of turnbased strategy and I've been playing it for YEARS, over and over and over again. So I let myself be convinced to invest in JA3, but it's hard to like so far. The game doesn't resemble JA2 gameplay at all other than the laptop interface, the merc management, the puns and sharing the name. 

My main gripe is tactical combat. Even though everything is in your face and you see lots of detail, he maps are TINY compared to JA2 and it seems they only focused on detailed, up close graphics which I don't care for AT ALL in a JA game. I want big tactical maps with plenty of routes and hiding places where I can use distance to my advantage, lure them out and create choke points. I would trade 75% of the graphic fidelity for this in a heartbeat. I also miss micromanaging the gear and especially the backpack/gear system from 1.13, but even vanilla JA2's gear setup was better than this. Ja3's gear system is overly simple and the UI layout for it more resembles the interface for a mobile game than a PC title made for 4k screens because the buttons are HUGE.

The turn-based combat system is basically ripped from Wasteland 3 (or vice versa, it handles and even LOOKS exactly the same) with the 1.13 aiming mechanics tacked on. Wasteland 3 gameplay was 'ok' but way too limited (the progression was 100% gated and the map options exhausted really soon) and JA3 feels like that too.

The saddest part is - this is not a question of patching some stuff and making it ok. The flaws are in the core of the design of this game and would require a 1.13 style overhaul to make it entertaining enough to hold a candle to JA2 which is very bad considering it only launched today.

- edited after tacking on some more hours -

To the people who don't agree with my review:

The one thing that became less bad putting more hours in it has been that the tactical maps got slightly bigger, but that's about it.

Yes, I will grant you that a BIG part of my disappointment is expectation, but JA2 was, to be fair, a game for fans. You either loved it or you didn't. Banking on that big name to sell the game HAS to have had the developers thinking 'we should be careful with those expectations' and even if they did consider it, I don't think they did enough on that front.

The graphics must have cost an inordinate amount of time that would have been, in my opinion, better spent on more in depth gameplay details like the gear system and tiny details like, indeed, auto-reloads.

If this game was called Jagged Alliance 1 and it was a first, no one would complain, It's solid enough to be a standalone game, sure. But it's not. It's called 1) Jagged Alliance which implies it's the same sort of game (no argument there) but 2) it also carries the '3' implying a continuation. While the references to Arulco and previous characters are definitely there, they omitted a big part of the inherent difficulty of managing an actual team, instead opting for more RNG difficulty.

The crafting system is overly simply as well. Scrap + powder equals bullets. Scrap + steel tube/lenses equal every other weapon mod. It feels like a placeholder more than anything else. Gear is always repaired to 100% so while you're healing you can, at the same time (with the doctor healing his own broken legs and fractured skull) having the entire party's gear bumped back up to full condition for exactly zero challenge since you're drowning in scrap anyway. Where is the wear and tear? Why can't I go to a hospital and buy medical supplies? Why does every market stall offer only 1 item for sale, despite the table depicting dozens of items? Why can any idiot 'hack' any electronic device for instant cash? 

And think about it: It's TURN BASED STRATEGY. That means PLANNING. This game requires literally ZERO planning. You just click heal, click repair, and drop into the next sector. I find myself clicking auto-resolve more and more (when available) because I have NEVER lost an auto-resolve battle even with overwhelming odds and the battles are predictable anyway. Set up overwatch with a few mercs, draw them out with a sniper and end-turn your way to victory throwing in a few shaped charges to mass-annihilate most of the bunched-up enemies.

Yes, it definitely feels like a JA game on SOME fronts, but more than that I get the distinct feeling of a retail Warcraft vs. Vanilla Warcraft, with most actions being a click-to-perform-action EZ mode story instead of an actual TBS game. And I can sort-of understand that choice if you happen to have an amazing, deep and engaging story to tell. But come on... bad guy with money deposes president, poor citizen scrapes together some savings to hire a bunch of mercs. Mercs shoot up the place, done. Be honest, the story for any JA game is just a means to an end, a reason for making the game. JA3's backstory is not going to win any Bafta's so they simply can't get away with letting the story lead the experience.

""But you're still playing the game"". Yes, because it's a story, and I want to know how it ends. But you can be sure this game will not get the amount of screentime its predecessor got by a long mile.

So no, I haven't changed my opinion, and I don't think that will change. Wasteland 3 got away with it because I only paid 6 euro for it, and even then it was only 'fairly priced'. I really do appreciate that the developers have likely put in sleepless nights and loads of their time and attention (that goes for both Ja3 and WL3) so I put the blame mostly on the people overseeing these projects.

So just to be clear: Yes, JA3 is a great game and yes, it captures the spirit of the first two perfectly. I played both of them (for hundreds of hours each) and all of the mostly shitty spin-offs in between. If you liked Jagged Alliance 1 and/or 2 back in the day, grab this one, you won't make a mistake. It's is NOT dumbed down in any significant way. I'd argue that they added depth in a lot of areas.

I've now played about 17 hours with the wife in coop mode (yay to that feature alone) and we're having a blast. Game runs very smooth except for a few sync-error-messages you can simply ignore. 

I'll just use the rest of this review to address a few of the espescially funny ""points of criticism"" I've read here:

- ""The UI is too small to read and cannot be scaled!"" UI is actually scalable...
- ""Mercs can only wear helmets, vests and pants now. What happend to equipping shoes?"" You can't wear shoes in any of the predecessor...
- ""Enemies don't drop everything they were wearing upon death!"" Again: they didn't in JA 1&2 either...
- ""You need keyboard-shortkeys to do simple things like crouch/prone/stand up!"" Uhh... No, you don't...
- ""Game is too hard/easy!"" Well, which one is it now? I for one feel challenged/ punished when I do something stupid. If you feel differently: There are plenty of difficulty options....
- ""Stealth system doesn't work! Enemies spot my inexperienced/ill-equipped merc in seconds!"" I think you can find the flaw in your logic there by yourself...

a. wrap their head around the concept of remembering things differently than they actually were (especially 20 something years later).

b. have a look at the options menu or the UI before posting some bullshit review.

- UI, inventory. The interface feels clunky and not very intuitive. Inventory could use some kind of general stash, not only sector based. On the other hand, there is no need of accumulating weapons and armor, just stick to what your mercs use and scrap everything else for parts.
- Stealth mechanics - once you get used to it, it works. Many people don't like it, it is difficult to clear a sector with just one merc with a knife but still, removing even two-three enemies can give you an advantage. The biggest problem is the lack of ability to move/hide bodies.

Even without the baggage of an existing franchise, the game itself stands on solid legs. The combat is interesting and keeps you on your toes, the mercenaries and their personalities are diverse and the pacing of the whole game feels just right.

There are minor issues depending on your preferred playstyle. Anyone familiar with games like XCOM, Wasteland 3 and the like will probably not be too happy to learn that hit percentages are obscured if you don't want to use mods. I like this design choice as it promotes riskier play, but I can see how hit percentages would help certain players play this game their own way. The real time exploration into turn based combat may also put off some people, but it's much more in line with what Jagged Alliance 2 offered.

If you've played games like these before, do consider bumping up difficulty one step to what you're used to. Thanks to mod support, you're getting more and more options courtesy of the community by the day. 

Mercenaries also don't change their appearance based on the equipment you put on them. I imagine this will put off some people, but I like seeing them present themselves as each of them is unique. Though I would have liked several steps in changes of their appearance and armor weight. Thor would only ever wear sandals, we know this.

On the flip side, gun models are very detailed and show all the mods you apply to them. And there are plenty of guns to choose from once you find any.

Overall, this offering stands on its own two legs and does not have to rely on a franchise name to be a good game. It provides meta-commentary as the previous games did and does not take itself too seriously.

It seems like they did it. I never thought I'd see another true Jagged Alliance game, but here it is.

The merc roster is great. I immediately loved both old and new characters (marry me Katalyna). Combat is good, strategic element is good, finding guns is good ... everything feels like Jagged Alliance, but still improved and added upon, not changed. I'm so happy I might shed a tear.

Edit: I just read some of the negative reviews and almost all of them just don't know what they're doing and blaming the game for it. You're not supposed to rush into a stronghold (unless you're absolutely elite skill or something), you have to weaken it first by doing missions.

You absolutely CAN fire single shot with something like an AK (that's the beauty of assault rifles, they're versatile, only something like an MP40 can only shoot burst).
You also CAN change the UI scale.
Some people are just never gonna be happy. Don't let your fun be spoiled by them.

Specific things I like:
As said, the merc roster. There's maybe not super many to begin with, but the game hints there will be more AND there are no 'useless' mercs. All of them make sense (so a little quality of quantity).

The way they handled 'chance to hit' is perfect. It's not an exact chance to hit (which makes it more analytic, less fun) BUT they also don't make you make a wild guess. You have indicators (range, modifiers) which help you make an informed guess (but you still go by feel). Love it.

Fist pumping when you make a headshot that you needed to hit.

I like how the combat feels like it's Jagged Alliance (like AP's for 'aiming') but they expended on it with crit chance, choosing between aiming more or taking cover, etc...",1689366243,1689605898,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I believe there were 14 Jagged games made in total, and the series went downhill after Back in Action (which was not as bad as most people thought imho). Haemimont delivered an excellent game, finally after all those failed cash-grabs which defouled the Jagged name.

This game oozes Jagged Alliance 2 fondness and the bigger icons and maps are a great sight for old eyes like mine. JA2 was hampered by a poor resolution, which made the game nigh unplayable for older gamers without the use of a big magnifying glass. The many Easter Eggs will bring a smile on your face when you encounter them.

The graphics are great, the tactical maps well designed and very pretty to look at. Most of the mercs return, and even some M.E.R.C. ones. A great nostalgia trip as they voiced the characters true to the original. There are again a lot of sectors to conquer, a lot of side-quests and a lot of enjoyable, well written characters. Combat feels great and going on a stealthy sniper killing spree is so much fun. 

All the core features of JA2 have returned, and they all play excellent. As said before, they really captured the whole JA2 feel, in a new modern coat. People who played the original JA2 will fondly remember the great characters it contained and most of them have returned in 3, with great unit graphics and well voiced speech.

Now back in the day when the Internet was barely a thing the process of figuring out which game would be worth your limited pocket money consisted of squinting your eyes at the back of the cover and praying to the gaming gods that the images and descriptions thereon were at least an approximations of the truth. At the suggestion of said friend I ended up settling for an unknown game entitled [i]Jagged Alliance[/i]. Though it took some figuring out we were quickly hooked on that odd blend of resource management and turn-based combat, and spend most of our after school hours liberating the island of Metavira.

A few years later this great yet suspiciously underrated game got its sequel, and by God what a sequel it was! Improving on everything the original had set out on, [i]Jagged Alliance 2[/i] presents us to this day with some of the most addictive, challenging, fun, complex, and at times outright hilarious mixture of RPG, strategy, and turn-based tactics. It was truly a sandbox game before the phrase was even popularized: letting you loose on a huge world full of items to collect, people to interact with, and building to blow up, offering you countless approaches to each situation while rewarding experimentation. In a game where a single missed shot could set of a chain reaction of mishaps that could result in half a dozen casualties on either side, success was massively satisfying while failure was at times freaking hilarious.

Then came the historical period known the Digital Dark Ages wherein everything that carried the name of the franchise seemed cursed to be less than mediocre. The hard-core fanbase of the series however continued to fire up their beloved JA2 which thanks to the many and amazing mods only grew more and more beautiful as time went by. Still there was that yearning for something new, and the hope that one day the glory of the past would rise again.

Now the year is 2023 and after having our hearts broken by false promises time and time again, the stars have aligned and we are reliving the joy of those simpler times.

Once there you will be put in a weirdly disadvantaged positioned, where you'll need to fight across open ground or battle your way up a hill.

So positives: Its the long awaited sequel to JA2 and much much better than back in action, which was a desaster. Graphics are nice, overlay is nice, small footprint on harddrive, overall gameplay is as expected, easy to jump into. I am grateful that they didnt let the series die. Also they will do Mod support, which is the single most important thingy. Nobody uses multi in my view, even its a nice gimmick. Characters are back and cool.

So but why no recommendation yet? The negatives:
- Too much Xcom style combat. You sneak up an enemy, knife them, maybe they dont die completely, then they see you and everyone gets time to move to cover (100% like xcom) and it destroys any sneaking. Too much action. It just doesnt encourage any sneaky gameplay.
- The whole game has been simplified, feels like a mobile game for teens. No deepness, e.g. Inventory is waaaaayyyy to simple and makes no sense, same with armor and gear, waaaaayyyy to simplified.
- NO, i repeat NO Bobby Rays??? wtf? I spent hours just browsing through that
- Difficulty way over the top
- Not enough weapons, attachments are overly simplified
- Maps are too small
- Mines run out waay too quick
- Local shops are over-simplified

All in all, feels like it started as a mobile game or a online game and then was converted to suit the masses. Not complex enough, not tactical enough, not enough possibilities, rushed, unfinished.

The vast majority of the positive reviews are more than likely from people who wanted a true successor to JA2, with all the jank and difficulty that came with a game from that period. If thats what your after then by all means go ahead and buy. 

However, if your like me, who has not played a JA game before, you are most likely not going to like this game. I went into the game knowing full well the game would be difficult, but dear god the artificial difficulty in this game is incredibly gross. The enemies from the get-go are equipped with AK's and other automatic weaponry. At the start you can really only afford the mercs that are equipped with pistols. So logically youd think that killing the enemy with the AK's would allow you to loot the weapons? Nope. Either im incredibly unlucky or weapons don't drop from enemies and you can only find them from stashes and the sort. I could go on about what i hate about the artificial difficulty but at the end of the day i cant be bothered. 

TLDR: Game difficult, too much artifical difficulty, if you want something similar go buy Battletech

If you read the reviews the consensus for previous players of the series seems to be hey it’s pretty ok and a Jagged alliance game but not as vast as Jagged 2. 

I also think despite the tutorial a couple th ones can be overlooked and make your first run a little tricky, not to mention the coming to terms with basically no trading system which in games like these you go into EXPECTING to come across hence you’ve hoarded weapons for resale( there is a barebones one you’ll find at points but it really is very barebones)

I’d like way more options for custom character customisation too. 
I can’t speak for that, I’ve not played it but I certainly will be doing after completing this as I’m having a fantastic time. 

The AI seems decent and sometimes makes perfect plays that really make your character squirm as poor positioning can be heavily punished. 
The characters are full of charm and have comments and opinions on others you hire with sometimes hilarious results. 

I really enjoy the default of not showing you %chance to hit and judging yourself based on the range gauge and + and - from cover, shot location etc vs your characters marksman stat.

I do think a bit more transparency on stat effects would be nice.
I like that you can go into every fight and play it how you want- stealthy, full frontal assault, environmental usage ( explosive barrels, cars, using MG emplacement etc) 

All in all it’s probably an 8/10 combat strategy game that is pushed up to a 9 for the amount of flavour from the characters, but I think if you’re on the fence and a former jagged alliance 2 player maybe wait for a sale.",1689593647,1689593647,True,1,0,0.50109410285949707,0,True,False,False

How much use you make of it obviously depends on you, but by and large, I think it's fair to say that this game was designed with the idea in mind that players will make heavy use of savescumming. 

2. All of the maps are somewhere between rather and ridiculously small, strictly limiting your tactical and strategical options. Making long detours to, for example, blast your way through the back wall of a building as was possible (and fun!) in JA1 and JA2 is not possible anymore. Most of it is relatively straightforward now. 

3. The game heavily encourages taking cover and using the ""overwatch"" function to automatically shoot enemies when stepping into your merc's line of vision. More complex tactical approaches such as trying to flank enemy groups are penalized compared to simply taking cover somewhere and using overwatch. Also, enemies always get a free turn to move as soon as combat starts, so creating ambushes also doesn't work. 

4. Scouting the map and positioning your mercs in order to, say, flank an enemy group is penalized not only by the fact that the maps are so small but also because the game does not allow you to manually switch between real-time and turn-based mode. And as soon as 1 merc is spotted by 1 enemy, the game switches to turn-based mode and the fighting begins for everbody, even for those mercs on the other side of the map. The game discourages you from taking your time to get into good tactical positions. 

5. The game encourages you to rush because the money is so tight and the mines can run out of diamonds. It discourages you from taking your time with battles, training militia, etc. It wants you to be in a hurry and rush forward because you constantly risk of running out of money. 

6. The AI not only of the enemies but also of your own mercs is lacking. For example, you will often run into minefields and even if your mercs notice the mines and they are outlined in red on the ground will they happily step into the mines. So while the game forces you to hurry when it comes to fighting and planning, it also forces you to take a lot of time to walk your mercs one by one through a minefield.

7. The writing is mediocre. The game wants to satirize old-fashioned action movies, but most of these jokes are so bad that the game does not feel like a parody OF something but like the kind of cringe B-movies intelligent writers could satirize. 

8. There is no online marketplace to buy weapons, ammo, and other stuff anymore. Dead enemies usually don't drop what they wore. You will mostly use the same old same old boring guns, deal with a lack of ammunition and run around with a backpack full of half-empty weapons you have to switch between. This also makes you feel less like a mercenary group fighting an African ""Legion"" but like a bunch of African peasants desperately living from whatever they can loot somewhere themselves.

9. You cannot determine yourself if you want to attack during night or day, rain or sun, further limiting your ability to prepare tactically. 

10. All of this also results in the fact that variety in this game is largely aesthetic. Sure, the environment sometimes looks differently - sometimes it's night, sometimes it's day, sometimes there are trees, sometimes deserts, etc. - but the actual gameplay doesn't vary that much.

11. The game sometimes feels as if the developers weren't quite sure what kind of a game they actually wanted. On the one hand, the difficulty is relatively challenging - especially due to the lack of money and the scarcity of ammunition - on the other hand, it sometimes feels dumbed down compared to JA1 and JA2. The result is a game that sometimes feels like a dumbed-down action game for autistic Zoomers with their infamously short attention span while simultaneously having a difficulty level that would actually require more elaborate strategic planning: only that the game penalizes you for trying to do so. 

12. The fighting itself if often still fun, and it's still satisfying to get a critical headshot finally killing some enemy sniper, but within the context of the game, it just gets boring after a while, and I can't see myself investing ~60 hours or so to finish it. I think the game is worth around $10 to play for around ~10 hours.",1689588257,1689591465,False,14,0,0.547237575054168701,0,True,False,False

Is JA3 playable? Yes. Now let me explain the thumbs down.

This is based on a 20 year old game, transitioned to 3D graphics (limited), with the strategic depth cut back in numerous ways, and still using 20 year old system that dont hold up anymore.

For anyone who is familiar with JA2, this is not nearly as in-depth or fleshed out. This does capture the feel of Jagged Alliance, if JA was ported to mobile. The merc personalities are fun and the voice lines are okay.

The art style is nice but the UI is a little clunky and many actions require keyboard shortcuts since there is no associated UI element.
Customization/appearance options are ZERO. Mercs do not show what gear they are wearing. Your custom-made merc has 3 options for male and 3 for female. None are great and can't be changed.
No walking. Mercs either run everywhere or crouchwalk. 

Maps are small. Tactical positioning opportunities are very limited, especially with half a dozen mercs and a dozen enemies all on the same map. As soon as a fight starts, it will resolve with very little change in positioning, mostly just adjusting for cover. You don't get much room to move before a fight is forced, either forward or back to tactically fall back.

Guns are balanced in an arcade fashion. They have to be considering the short engagement ranges on small maps. SMGs are weak and have abysmal range, shotgun are almost point blank only options, AR/MGs are king for multi-target versatility, and marksman rifles are one of the few ways to get consistent one/two kills.
Guns are weak. You can headshot an enemy 4 times before they go down... unarmored. Unless you're sniping.
Combined/related to low gun damage is the high health pool of enemies. I havent played a shooter with bullet sponges this bad since Division 2.

Stealth is almost unusable. Stealth kills before combat are a waste of time; one hit kills on unaware enemies is RANDOM and if you dont succeed then youre at a disadvantage when combat starts. There are more dedicated stealth oriented mercs, so I guess you use them because RNG for everyone else is garbage. Oh and an enemy facing away from you will eventually hear you even if youre behind them in full cover a fair distance away not moving, but without a specialized stealth merc. I guess my merc farted.

You cannot pause in the pre-combat phase to set up your mercs properly. Its realtime, one at a time and the game doesnt even pause when enemies are sighted, get close, are becoming aware, etc. If you like RTS tactical shooters, thats what it feels like for the first 15 seconds before the first bullet flies.. and its usually the enemy's because they spotted you when you didnt even see them offscreen.

Enemies clearly do not follow the same action point system mercs do. Either that or the enemey has genetically modified supersoldiers who can 1) be shot in the head 3 times b) run 15 feet while jumping over a low fence and around chest high barrels c) run behind you, and then d) turn around and shoot you. all on one turn! They are also deadly accurate when shooting you in the head with burst fire while youre behind half-height cover. Half height cover in this game is useless (except to actually take cover behind which uses your whole turn/actions).

There is no economy of buying/selling guns. If you find a merchant, they may sell 2 guns. And wont buy. All money comes from running around maps looting/stealing from locals after a fight.
No vehicles.
No swimming.
Lots of unlikeable NPCs.

So... if you want some XCOM turn based action on a small scale with troops who have actual personalities, but you want slimmed down strategic management, and you are OK with most of the issues I've mentioned... then Id recommend JA3. On sale. Half price or lower.

but this game... needs some serious work. in its current state I cannot wholheartedly recommend this game. 

- combat is unbalanced 
damage is seemingly random. sometimes you kill someone with less than 30dmg to the head. other times a critical hit with over 130dmg does not do the trick 

- stealth mechanic is ""lacking""
the game suffers from bad similarities with XCOM enemy behavior. there´s no reliable way to ambush and really surprise anyone. as soon as the enemy is in combat, all AI has a 360 vision and each enemy knows exactly where your mercs are. 
also, once surprise hits fail, all enemies scatter and somehow get extra action points to get to the closest cover. 
your mercs start the next round without action points (because they acted in the ambush) thus leavin them in a good position for the ambush (which ""failed"" and a bad situation for a normal gunfight. 

the whole turn based system is not thought through. there´s no initiative. its just ""you move your units, then enemy moves. ""
vision is 360 for all enemies, yet overwatch is cone-based. overwatch is also the only option to mitigate AI moving directly up to you and unloading. 

your people have about 8-12 action points (depending on skills). max seems to be 14. 
enemies consistently seem to have more. as they run and gun like madmen. 

loot system is not too shabby. its not that every enemy drops every item they currently - and obviously - are using. BUT the game literally showers you with guns. some are badly damaged. but don´t worry, most guns are a waste of ammo and space anyways. 

hit chances are not visible (except when using mods)
you can alse savely assume that enemy hit chances are superior. just wait for the first dust storm encounter or lange range egangement and you know what I mean. 

the game is in desperate need of balancing, tweaking and a patch. 
especially the stealth and surprise mechanic needs a rework. 

oh and another thing about the weapons system: you cannot buy stuff. you have to loot and build things. which is fine. But why can´t I detach a scope from rifle A and -re-attach it to rifle B ? 

I would think the mercs have an armoury not only of fitted weapons, but of attachements, scopes and other addons. modern weapons are adjustable. its not that stuff is glued / welded on them.. 

for die hard fans its a buy anyways. don´t be disappointed though. 
it needs LOADS of work. 

and patience to get through the BS.

Greatest Jagged Alliance game in my opinion that could use some polish up:
- TAKE OUT THE GUESS WORK: An icon on tiles where militias can be trained.
- LEARN FROM JAGGED ALLIANCE 1: Add in the porno magazines and keep the mostly male player base on an adult scavenger hunt
- MORE CUSTOMIZATION: For custom character in AIM, allow choice of different voices to go with the characters. More faces/looks.
- MORE ACTION: Be-headings from special rifle/sniper shots are amazing. But add something to the other attack types too! Arms, legs, groin. More dismemberment, and allow players to turn them on or off.
- MORE INTERACTION BETWEEN MERCS: Really well done for Steroid, Raven & Raider (super funny and likable guy), Limewire, voice-overs and auto reacts to each other. Magic's lines are 10/10 right on. Please do more and continue to expand these interactions between mercs to give the impression of growing relationships.
- MORE TRANSPARENCY: View relationships with each MERC at contracts page. Show discounts getting with MERCs due to relationship.
- BETTER UI & UX: Reading e-mail is a huge pain for people used to the refined Google Gmail in their daily life. The least you could do is make smaller the top right e-mail selector box, and widen the reading content box at the bottom so people don't have to be scrolling 1 sentence at a time.
- INTEL CENTRAL: Be more clear on how to view intels. Have a central map area, or overlay on map that allow players to manipulate and view intel summaries. The UI/UX for intel anything could be vastly improved. Many seemingly clickable words and links looking like links in Notes are not clickable. Please stop making them look like clickable links. Could change their font colour instead to highlight them instead.
- SOME CONVENIENT GUIDANCE: Instead of having players try to figure out what each icon means in Notes, have a button labeled Legends, and explain what icons etc do or mean, in detail. Notes is basically JA version of Quest book. This area could use serious UI/UX improvements so people know what next steps are.
- NO MORE BULLETS: Even on easy mode, seem to run out of bullets in firefights to a point players have to decide between money, bullets, and actually bothering with side or main quests. Please come up with a shop system of some sort and populate the map with them for players to be able to exchange money into bullets. And please make it a good UI and UX so that players can search for bullets using what their squad's mercs have equipped!

Am a long time fan of the franchise. Still come back to JA 1.12 every now and then. 

[b]Now the review:[/b]
This game is in every way the spiritual successor of the Jagged Alliance series. After the atrocities of ""back in action' - this game returns to a proven concept of turn based rounds. It plays much the same as XCOM does. Turn based tactical shooter where cover matters a good deal. It is a bit more arcadey and despite warnings, in my opinion, a bit more forgiving. It's a very relaxing timesink, it works intuitively and scratches the JA itch. They sadly cut the merc roster a bit, but the merc's are alot more involved in the story now as a tradeoff. They are more fleshed out characters.

[b]Good points:[/b]
- Banter / Live reactions during combat is spot on. The humor is nostalgic but perfect
- Characters really come alive even more than in JA2. 
- Improved on some systems. For example the ""merc tasks"" - via operations its now intuitive and clear what character stats are necessary for what tasks -  and what tasks are available
- In conversation prompts now show which stat you need in order to ""convince"" someone of your goal. 
- It's finally a new JA story. Same humor. Same everything. In 2023. It's good.

[b] Cons [/b]
- Absense of the weapon shop ???? It's great that you include alot more guns... but atleast give us access to it...
- The whole satellite view (old laptop) is just bad. It's hard to navigate from 1 page to the other. 
- Seriously the out of sector view UI is so terrible... it hurts. 
   > The amount of time I wanted to check how much militias I have in a sector and suddenly ended up sending my entire squad there on a walk ... It happened atlesat 10 times in 20 hours. In a game where time is critical.. this isnt good.
   > Missing basic map filters that give a clear headsup.
   > Missing overview of who's doing what - you need to check per squad. Meaning if squad 1 finishes a task whilst you're having squad 2 open, you might miss it completely and have people idling unnecessarily
   > The overview unpauses, unprompted, ALL the time. Everytime you select a new task for example the game instantly assumes I want time to move forward? 
  > Many more UI related frustrations that can just be better... email, merc browsing etc

- Absense of certain nostalglic elements, for example the absense of ""honorable""mentions of mercs not in the game, with a funny story of what theyre doing right now
- The absense of Rudy ""Lynx-Eyed"" Roberts. Seriously what were they thinking leaving this dude out :(
- A few other missing mercs, that hopefully will be added as DLC. Since the mercs really have a personality, I genuinely understand that creating a merc just costs alot of time and money. But I want more.

- In sector UI can be a bit better refined too. Especialyl the ability to start turn-based mode at will
- The ability to ""freeze"" the game and give out orders. Before turn based combat starts, there isnt a way to pause movement to plan the perfect ambush. 
- This is really a problem when the enemy is invading you with 6 enforcers/brutes. Who have insane health pools and just run at you with their shotguns. Shotguns just are so very very strong. 

[b]Verdict: [/b]
The game is very playable and enjoyable. But it definitely suffers from poor UI design and could be a bit better with a few QoL updates. It's still fun :)

This game is basically take JA2 1.13 (get rid of most guns and items obviously), and dilute it down by about 50%, then add a bunch of stuff from wasteland 3, and a bunch of stuff from fantasy RPGs.
It's not bad (though I question some of the decisions), but it is a interesting mix.

The tone and humor is a bit more zany. It feels a bit more like theme hospital or tropico than JA2. JA2 was, for all intents and purposes, literally 1-for-1 ripped from any number of ""man on a mission"" 90s action movies about one bad guy, a masculine male protagonist, who needs to save the girl and save the world at the same time. James Bond minus any suits and ties and british accents (and talking. And gadgets lol). It's not bad. Characters like Steroid Gonkarsky are very funny because of their ridiculousness, and clear inability to understand that what they're saying is ridiculous. But I would steer away from characters like Livewire, and steer towards characters like in JA2, not all of which were funny characters (and a lot of funny characters were funny unintentionally, either from writers, or from the character themselves, look at the a bit too overconfident miner, or Maddog, were they honestly Steroid Gonkarskys, or were they steroid gonkarskys on accident, characters that were and are so ridiculous that they can't help being funny)? I feel as though there should've been a bit more different aspects in terms of characters and writing being pursued. Currently, there's just very serious (and mature, in a good way) plot lines about small town politics looking for a scapegoat with Luc and Pierre, and then there's completely intentional and ridiculous Steroid Gonkarsky type characters and humor. What about making characters that are just crazy, or out there. What about making cool suave characters (Wolf is the only example I can think of there). The original JA2 I feel was more serious and unironic in its attempt to replicate 90s action movies, and wasn't all about humor and all about zany characters all the time. This is a very difficult tightrope to walk and to even point out that it exists, but I feel like in the future the direction the writers should be given is to try to replicate 90s action movies uniornically, versus with an intentional attempt to have a good time and lampoon everything. The tone feels a little bit like Space Rangers, which was a bit comical from the get go. It's not a real criticism, and not a real downside, but if devs asked me how to refine the writing, this is how I would do it. A bit less zany theme hospital type humor, a bit more unironic replicas of 90s action movies, a bit more Rambo 2, which may have ended up being ridiculous, but certainly was played unironically, and the characters were being unironic.

The gameplay is fine, it's a bit all over the place, but there's nothing wrong with it.

A big aspect that I would criticize is how the entire game went away from ""realistic simulator of base assault"", to complete and total ""CRPG, except without swords and only guns instead"". The action is much closer together, it doesn't feel like you're setting up and strategizing a large scale assault on big maps, Range doesn't seem to matter as much, and there's really not much opportunity for long range sniping. Everything feels very squished together, and you have a choice between two ranges, close, and very close. 10 feet or 100 feet, that's the realistic extent of your battle. In JA2, meanwhile, it did feel as though if you wanted to there'd be opportunities to snipe people down 5 blocks from where you are, to perch yourself up on a big warehouse, to clear out one big warehouse, then assault the next big warehouse. There'd be a lot of nuance here, and a lot of interesting variety. JA3 feels a bit too much ""CQB simulator"" to me. What I would change is make the action more spread out, and make the average range and distance of engagement a bit longer.

You can tell some of the talents for mercs the devs began running out of ideas, and that's not a knock on them, but they should've had some kind of general or generic talents that more than one merc could have. Otherwise, it's' a bit tough to come up with 40 different talents, you'll run out of ideas very quickly.

Some of the perks were not really what I was looking for. The way perks should've looked like, in my opinion, is this stat-heavy emphasis on insider baseball, to where, maybe a certain merc had +2 range to all DMRs, and +5% accuracy, or no AP cost reload. There are some percs like this, but also some percs that seem to be a bit less realistic.

I am happy with the freemove system (happy-ish), because I thought it'd be much more invasive than it turned out being, and therefore it's completely fine in my opinion. I would still prefer no free move I think, but it's ok.

They didn't really implement a store system, but in a way what they did was, in some respects, even better. Of course it'd be great to be able to sell your weapons and armor, and this is actually a big thing I would recommend for the devs to do next, to rebalance everything for people selling weapons and items. I don't think ammo crafting system is necessarily the way to go, it's not annoying, but I would prefer to find ammo and buy ammo. I am not a fan of crafting systems. Should there be a store or an NPC merchant, sure. I don't think what they did right now was bad, and in fact it's a good change and an interesting change. There's plenty of tables offering interesting deals, and that's what you want.

OVERALL RATING
8/10
Not exactly a JA2 style of strategy (might be more JA2 than most people remember, since vanilla was much more fun and arcade), but still a good game.
Basically if you took JA2 or JA2 1.13, simplified it by 50%, maybe a bit less, maybe 40%, then put it in a smoothie maker along with a sprinkling of Wasteland 3, KOTOR, and so on.

PS: Extra thumbs down go to forced artificial scenarios where ""Poachers"" (hunters) are made to look and sound annoying, and other artificial ""moral dillema"" scenarios that have none of the tasteful or good mature writing of the moral dilemma in the first Island with the village situation. There's a lot of very good mature nuanced writing, and then there's this blatant Vegan propaganda and dumbed down ""moral dillemas for 5 year olds"" and ""trolley thought experiment"" level writing. The Karen NPC was kind of funny and made sense, but the Poachers were an example of really stupid writing that verged on pandering, and there was some other crap.

PPS: An observation I would make is that this game suffered from a phenomenon I would like to call ""look up location IRL, see what happens there, put it into your game"". This is the same thing I saw Assassins Creed suffer from. What if nothing happens in this location. What if its pretty boring and globalized and close to other 21st century cities/towns from other countries. Then what. Well then you're screwed. And there's a bit of this in this game. Devs were so busy trying to copy and reference ""correct authentic"" Africa, that they weren't busy building a cool fantasy of Africa, or not Africa, just build a cool country period. Why does it have to be realistic, or be tied to, or derived from what you see in reality. It doesn't. There's no particular unique need to do anything special because the setting is in Africa, compared to the setting being in any other place in the world. You can create a cool story or narrative in Africa, the same way you can create it in South America, in South-East Asia. You couldn't tell JA2 was set in a third world South American country beyond a few basic facts. Enrico Chivaldori met you in a cafe in Prague, everybody dressed in modern neutral and formal clothing, all cinematics had people acting in a way you'd expect from most modern leaders. This JA, not so much.

Overall, not bad, even not too much surprising. If you like JA2 or JA Crossfire, it's the similar sense that: 

Pros (the same as previous JA2): 
1. Ammo management (hardcore)
2. AP & Aiming system (without hit rate IS a JA feature, not bug, this is hardcore for player to estimate the rate of hits) 
3. Stealth mod
4. Enemy is reacting OK 
5. Weapon System (Mod & Range)
6. Wounded System stays the same feeling
7. Like the talking of Mercs


I also like the new:
1. The fixed machine gun (completely new powerful weapon)
2. Dogs are added (as enemy) 
3. Scout System and areas revealed
4. Merc level up now has skils; Merc has initial skills and special skills
5. You can aim different parts of body (5 I think? JA2 was 3); what's even better is which part is armor protected is also listed. 

Cons: 
1. The UI and Operation are kind of weird - not a critical failure, but... just weird; e.g.: your aiming seems to be not that confortable
2. Map is kind of small? 
3. Not much revolutionary reworks (but maybe this is JA rather than XCOM or Wasteland)
4. It has potential but not perfect at least now.
5. Where is the online shop? (maybe it needs time to unlock?)

Overall, I suggest to buy - especially if you are huge fun of JA2; if JA is completely new to you, it's OK too but not that attractive.

A fan overhaul for Jagged Alliance 2 was patch, V1.13
This patch had made the game go far in depth into simulation and tactics.

Jagged Alliance 3 is not a continuation of patch V1.13, nor is it a continuation of JA2. A lot of the reviews are being, I believe, unfair regarding that comparison. Rather than having the game stand on it's own merit, they are hoping it to be an extension of those games. While not as in depth as JA2, by a small margin, I am having an amazing time with Jagged Alliance 3.

If you are used to the new XCOM, or XCOM2, you will find there is little explanation and more feel about how to go about things in this game. Do I get bonuses for being in cover? Yes. Do I get bonuses for being in bushes? Probably. What are my chances of hitting this guy? Well are you aiming for the head with a pistol from far away with a guy who has bad marksmanship? Probably not gonna hit. Do you have a veteran marksman atop a building laying prone with a long distance rifle? Chances are good.

I've watched a few youtuber's try this game without much tactical thought at all. Not using kneeling position, not going prone when having a few Action Points (AP) left, not right clicking the mouse to spend more AP to aim better. It's all kinda cringe. The game gives you pop ups, tool tips, and a UI bar letting you know about these things. I guess the newer generation just grew up on different games. Take the time to learn the controls, it's more simulation and sandbox compared to XCOM.

There are more RPG elements in here than the previous Jagged Alliance games. Not much more. One big change is that all the merc's have unique perks that they only have. It's a cool addition, because it gives more flavor to the mercs, and also gives more interesting combinational tactics in the game.

The game would be considered difficult by today's standards for sure, but if you enjoyed JA2 back in the day, I would say the game is pretty easy once off the tutorial like island. If you're a fan of the old JA games, put the difficulty up a notch.

If you want more of JA2 1.13, this game might not be for you.

If you like simulated fire fights, this game is for you.
If you like being tactical and sneaky, this game is for you.
If you like planning squads and send them scouting, and setting up distractions, this game is for you.
If you like figuring things out on your own, thinking ""I wonder if this would work?', this game is for you. 
If you like the 80's and 90's type stereotypical action heroes, there's lots of flavor here.

I remember an old army saying. Russian generals, play chess. American generals, play poker.

Chess is a game where both players have perfect information, they make the best move knowing everything.
Poker is a game where the players have imperfect information, they make the best move with what information they have.

XCOM is chess.

Very slow first couple of missions, likely to ease in newbs. But it really starts to ramp up when you start attacking fortified and built-up areas (next 5-10 maps). 

Mercs:  Some of them are annoying, but some pair up hilariously well (Fox and Wolf!!). As you randomly pair up teammates, they tend to engage in different conversations even if there wasn't explicit relationship mentioned. Gives you the Dragon Age vibes.

Animations: You have to play with mid to high tier graphics for now. I have a decent gaming computer but the vsync causes serious problems. The usual disappointing complaints --- lousy/non-existent ragdoll physics. characters slide on the ground forever,  Some of the animations are pretty interesting thuogh, almost John Woo style when leaping across obstacles.

Gameplay:  Some weapon mods seems pretty broken, especially the top tier infrared scopes. Seemingly impossible to miss which spoils the immersion. 
Because you can accomplish A LOT WITH STEALTH, it kinda breaks the game even at max difficulty. Am taking out half the enemies before they even know what's going on. Hopefully there'll be a mod that ups the ante, more enemies?

It's probably an OK tactical game, but I am severely disappointed. It's severely gutted, and some of the design decisions are baffling even if I ignore the history of the franchise.

Edit:
I forgot to mention that it runs terribly for such a passable looking game.
Edit 2:
Assymetric rules for AI, bullet sponge/overarmored enemies, extremely low equipment variety, a perk system that agressively limits player choice. You are given little storage, little information to plan anything, and a lot of the same 3 kinds of items over and over again.
Edits end.

Here is my vomitorium of disappointment:
You can't find cool stuff, because everything is generic resource trash. You can't go shopping for cool weapons, because they removed the online store. There are practically no logistics. Sector activities are even MORE annoying and restrictive than in JA2. The shooting feels wrong, and estimating chances to hit feels awful and uninformed. Tactical choices are extremely limited, and the battle space tiny. The enemy doesn't seem to play by the same rules as the player. No replay value due to the decision to manually design mediocre levels instead of generating only slightly worse ones that are almost infinitely plentiful. No active pause in a REALLY clunky real time mode. Mercs who spot mines run straight into them instead of stopping or walking around them (or pausing the game), leading to tedium without end. The most boring loot imaginable. Chafingly annoying characters ( Deedee for example ). Critical decisions without any data to base the decisions on within 30 minutes of starting the game. Overtutorialized with trash information, but short on critical data. Atrocious mobile game interface with tons of wasted space for a minimum of functionality. No LBE/molle system, instead the most primitive mobile game trash inventory you can imagine. No cool gear like comms, camo or nots. No decent stealth/trapping system. Terrible XCOM style cover system. Unpredictable cover/concealment system. No reliable planning/execution for pre-combat, just a clufu of APM rush to maybe get someone in a decent position while the rest of your people are exposed. No water ops. No survival component.

Even more a great sequel to a game that deserves it. Imagine if this was made by EA or Ubifart (Not studio Mainz, they are cool since they made the Anno and the Settlers game).

Now I played the Jagged Alliance 2 back in the day, even got the CD from Computer Swiat still in my possession.

The gameplay is good, only downside is that I don't get to go full 100 specs without a mod. And there are currently not a lot of options for pictures or models. You can notice that many enemies etc. look the same on the portraits with slight alterations (Glasses, Helms, Paintjob on ye face, etc.)

Music is actually very nice, especially the vocal tracks! The options that you can obtain by exploring or doing stuff are surprising me because there are a lot of them!| I wanted the speedrun achievement hence that I didn't pay all too much to the secondary objectives unless they were in the way or the road.

Way to get speedrun: 
Go to castle, main land, the refuge camp, clear bridge don't go back to camp but bee line to the top right corner. Then go south to the castle on K 16? that forth near the two mansions. Then go to the Ernie village (bottom left village you first arrive once starting the campaign). Then go to the old fort, go into the basement, and viola!

In old JA2 enemies stats ramped up with time .

 Early zones has  6-8 red shirts with passable loot, lots of  time to teach your mercs.  
Fun encounters airport, bars, towns.  

All this is a slaughter even in forgiving mode.  
Stealth is worthless now, silencers still alert the enemy.  
You, cant tell by the lighting if its day or night,  
No slots for bandages, camo , night vision goggles, sound phones. 
Head shots that should kill or at least slow enemies are  way too dependent on RNG . 
No way to tell if you should shoot no percentage to hit.  

The loot ratios are way to little,. Kill 14 get to loot 3 Bull shit

Screw the salvage BS, waste of time along with the modding for rifles. 
Wasted two hours just getting salvage to mod my six mercs weapons scraped every weapon , did ghost encounter every land mine .
Have two wonderful rifles with great stats and no ammo for either.  Creating ammo is stupid as you need 10, 20 ,30  salvage + gunpowder to get a random amount of ammo. 

No way to call Bobby Ray and get me some ammo for them.  

Armor , helmets pants don't drop. Killed at least 200 so far no loot worth it for all those kills except the bunker on starting island.  

As soon as you go to the mainland get one mine, make sure you train the militia to max or it will be gone in a week. 

They recommend you search each Zone for what to waste my time, the zones  closet to your mine have min 14 overpowered enemies, you have maybe 6-8 pieces of armor for six mercs, no ammo and no bandages .

Your snipers even if the have silenced weapons  are killed with ease from 25 spaces  away, prone and in cover,   

Everything is out of balance.  

If an encounter is triggered, as an ambush, your merc just sit while the enemy moves  BS, or on overwatch don't shoot  or shoot at maximum range  doing minimal damage. 
The enemy gets to reposition Horse shit.
 Every body on your team should  get to aim and shoot or hold for overwatch.  
 The enemy has too much movement. 
You can move three to four squares and shoot,  they move ten to twenty and still get to shoot. 

No balance, Ran into veterans in three squares already out searching for new mines which for some reason even with map of the mines are not showing up as mines. 

Wait for the mods not, just go back and play a fun game JA2 v 1.13.  May not look as good but a helluva lot more fun.

The great thing going for Jagged Alliance is that there are very few games of this genre set in the modern era between conventional forces, and it's one that interests me greatly.

I know that there are mods which enable hit percentage chances, but I agree with the developers that not having those displayed makes the game a bit more tense - whilst there's plenty of tools that will let you estimate otherwise whether your shots will connect.

JA / JA2 Vet here... Tried all the iterations over the years, all of them terrible to a different degree. One was not SO bad, but would have been better without naming itself ""Jagged Alliance"". 

So here we here, 20+ Years later after JA2 ... Is it any good?

Well, i'd say: Its a worthy successor. I would recommend it. I'm not perfectly happy, because i don't like some things, like: I can't pause in real-time, that makes ambushes really hard, the camera is sometimes my enemy and not my friend. The whole control feels a littlebit clunky. 

Am i offended by the mercs? How could i. JA was always over-the-top 80ties Action Hero Fest with ""stupid""-Loons. Whoever takes that seriously should take a break from the world and join a Yoga-Studio in Whereever!

The GFX are nice and i had no problems there (GTX 1080 user here). The SFX are also nice. 

There is a lot todo and while the Combat feels a bit more XCom-ish (or a JA/XCom Mix) the rest is kinda JA standard. Its not easy to get into, it can be overwhelming, so take your time. Go low on the Difficulty or you will be frustrated!

This is a triple A publisher that isn't short on cash but there have been so many corners cut that it severely hinders gameplay.  THQ Nordic could have given Haemimont more time, more resources and whatever they needed to finish the game properly, but no.  The search for the mighty dollar wins again and the greedy publisher laughs all the way to the bank while the gamer gets screwed.

There are a few fleshed out conversations with NPC's but most just give some floating text more like clicking on a quest marker than having a talk.  Likewise with many objects in game, no real descriptions just a bit of floating text.  No shops or traders, just some tables to click on that don't give you a choice of what to buy as each only sells one thing.  Imagine an arms dealer that only sells one type of gun or an ammo store that only sells one type of ammo and none of them buy your stuff.  Weapons dealers that don't buy weapons or anything else.  Would it have really taken that much extra time and effort to put in a robust trade system?  

So how does this impact gameplay?  By the time you are level 4 or 5 you will be running out of ammo and have no way to get more other than hoping an enemy comes along that drops a few rounds of the type you need.  You may as well try to win the lottery as the ammo drops are extremely low in the game.  Also there is no guarantee that a guy using a rifle that needs 7.62mm ammo will actually drop that.  I have had them dropping 12 guage shotgun shells without any of the enemies using a shotgun.

Another cut corner is with the tactical maps, many of which are repeated.  This game has a finite number of squares and each could have been unique but again, corners cut resulting in cut and pasted maps.  The deploy phase on these maps also stinks of being an afterthought as it is so poorly implemented.

I do not blame Haemimont Games for these shortfalls as I'm certain that they would have liked the time and resources to make the best game they could but THQ should hang their heads in shame.  I have given the game a thumbs up as like I said, it's ok.  It should have and could have been great but at the moment it just isn;t there.

Some smaller publishers have been hoping that gamers do not hold them to the standard of Larian Studios and Baldurs gate 3 and that's fine, they don't have the same resources.  But triple A publishers and developers have been marching out this mantra as well and that isn't ok.  Triple A publishers and developers should quite rightly be held to the same standard and gamers should demand it.  Larian have raised the bar and the others should be forced to pick up that gauntlet and run with it rather than forcing unreasonable time restraints etc. on the developers which results in mediocre and overpriced products  full of bugs and other problems.

Mmm! that escalated a bit.  In short an ok game that could, with time and effort be a great one.

Criticism first: 
- Its a bit further away from JA2 than JA1 purely on the basis of distances involved, small maps result in you effectively having to train cartel goons/urban commandos not an even mix of specialists which i loved to train in JA2. Make peace with that in your mind, it's integral and imo can't be ripped from the game with mods short of official expansion. 
[EDT: it's both better and worse than i originally thought. Better because there are actually plenty of opportunities to use long range weapons.  Worse because using a long rifle in CQC yields better results than using assault rifle or a shotgun. Pluckety pluck that.]  
- It has the 'ambush scamper phase' taken from xcom which is the sort of mechanic dot cx which imo should not be part of any turn based tactics game ever. 
- And lastly - the default ultra overheats GPU and motherboard to where you can cook shashlik and pretend to be chilling with Ivan and Igor at BBQ.  [EDT: I was giving a wrong advice - the game has loop control and timing problems and capping 30 fps and forcing software vsync is the right thing to do to keep it from overheaating hardware]

Positives:
It's JA. It's gunprawn. It doesn't have the boardgame vibe of Xcom. It's funny in a 90s way, without faux-edgy socon cartoon/Gamerboy goof. And there's no zombies tacked on, you shoot other willyweeds with guns just like you.

Then Jagged Alliance 2 came along, and for more than 20 years I've kept coming back to the game every now and again for that bit of nostalgia and intrigue. I've got countless of hours in JA2, be it Classic, Wildfire or 1.13. I've tried them all, and I think I've never once finished any of them. I didn't need to, the journey itself, the gameplay and the quirky characters, was enough to keep me entertained for many hours, days, months and years.

I've tried many of the successors over the years, but none of them quite had the same feel to them. I was always left disappointed, they just didn't feel like real Jagged Alliance games.

Ever since Jagged Alliance 3 was announced, I kept reading devblogs and watching streams with skepticism. It seemed like they hired the right people for the job, but after so many failed attempts, I couldn't really imagine they could recapture the magic that Jagged Alliance 2 had.

At the time of writing, I'm 12 hours into the game, and while initially it took me some time to get into the groove, to get used to the interface and the mechanics, I can honestly say I've thoroughly enjoyed my time so far. Jagged Alliance 3 is NOT Jagged Alliance 2, and I think that's a good thing. I'm enjoying the new experience, the new setting, the mix of old and new gameplay and I'm loving the characters and interactions.

JA3 is for me perfect. I have less time to play and it seems like this game is better for the kind like me. There is still loot, but no more having to open every #### cabinet and hears Bull say ''nothing''. Combat is fun and realistic. 

I've read a few complaints about people hearing their mercs say they gonna hit something or using mods to see hit% and not hitting it. Let me say that no hit is ever guarantee in real life. Just run, high heart rate and try to shoot, you always have a chance to miss. I use good Mercs and never saw a problem with my chance to hit. 

Story is good, dialogues are like the old one. I don't remember laughing so much at a dark joke like I did the other day in this game !

Gun customization is easier, less hassle then what I remember from JA2. In fact, everything is better on that side, you open the game, shoot bad guys, liberate the town and make choices. I'm having more fun than what I remember on JA2.

My first few days were spent figuring out how to cheese the game as much as possible and boy does this game let you do that. Spending a full year, to train yourself in the vacation home of your employer? You bet ya! Make yourself better the late Mike the Mercenary? Why not. Play the game solo because you love loading the same shot, over, and over again- because the damn loot system is so random that each kill can either drop nothing, or a full suit of riot gear, and a gun you won't see for another 15 hours and 200 bullets for it? That's this game.

Point is, it's a lot of fun, but it's not exactly that game you played in the late late 90's.

A few things I would love to see though, a pause button. Yes, your merc may be the universal soldier, but if he's walking _and_ thinking of stabbing a knife into the neck of the person he's perusing he'll have to stop and think about that one for a moment.

I mean enemies get the x-com interrupt every single time they hear a bump in the night, but heck to you if you want to just stop time for a moment as you see a large raiding party about to hit your new digs.

Look... I'm all for difficult.  But difficult isn't just rigging RNG against the player.  There is no strategy in the world that will keep you from getting shot, because they ALWAYS hit.  They can stand out in the open 20 feet away, and you will miss 50% of the time, and yet they will hit you 90% of the time they fire.

It's not hard to complete the mission, but it is impossible to do so without taking injuries.... 

The UI is pretty garbage as well, and many times you will have to click on something two or three times before it registers a click.  It doesn't use a lot of common sense either, as four missions in and I still have to fumble through menus trying to find the option that I want.

The tactical combat is good, enemy AI is smart enough, game is somewhat challenging - however, the real battle is fighting the UI. Its atrocious. Inventory system isn't very good either, but it's fine compared to all the times I had to stop my mercs from going somewhere I didn't order em, or when I wanted to get closer to the edge and for some reason they decide to drop down. All the tiny little janky UI details make it very hard to decisively say ""This is a good game that  is worthy of being called Jagged Alliance.""

Lots of quests that vary from ""My wife has been captured, please save her!"" (justifiable, feels like a good request for mercenaries), to ""give away those f-n pamphlets/find my passport/play ghostbusters"". Way too many quests, I haven't gotten farther than Pantagruel, but nearly every sector has a questmark, some even got multiple quests. And if you don't do em, you'll never get good prices/cheap medicine in towns.

Zero ways of preparing an actual ambush cause there's no way of forcibly going into turn-based mode or even an active pause like in, say, desperados. And it is a must for some quests - for example, in one of those quests you have to kill a group of rapists. Sounds easy, yeah? Well, no. The bad guys aren't considered enemies (and can't be shot at) until you come and talk to them. Which instantly puts you at a disadvantage. AND you can't just give everyone order for overwatch cause bad guys keep moving. Probably would have to get a few squads just to complete an early game quest.

Stealth is shit, enemy looking some other way doesn't mean everything behind them is a deadzone. They detect you with their third eye, I guess. And the detection itself? A slowly filling bar? Really?

Money doesn't solve any problems. You can't buy ammo/supplies unless you stumble upon a random merchant in some sector. Found a gun that uses an uncommon ammo? F'n pray that you find any.

You will also meet old acquaintances from the previous JA editions and this time you can again compose your own character. 

The game looks good, nice exciting music during the fights and not unimportant I personally think the humor is incorporated in the game. Also a very nice fact is that they have also added different weather conditions to the game (sandstorms, rain, night, heat waves) and that the choices you make in the game influence the course of it. For example, in the game you are faced with a choice to save or kill someone, which in turn has consequences with regard to relationships, rewards, morale, etc.

WTF were the developers thinking? No option for the player to initiate turn based combat (as in JA2) AND no active pause during realtime?

EDIT: This is even more of an issue because they introduced a ""New XCOM style"" animated ""discovery phase"" for the enemies.

This means stealth kills and pre-setting up your squad for combat becomes a ""realtime tactics"" challenge. NOT Jagged Alliance. 

TLDR: No recommendation from me until switchable turnbased combat and active pause during realtime portion are introduced and the ""New XCOM style"" silliness of ""free"" enemy ""pack movement""  is removed.

The only negative thing so far are the unreasonably high GPU usage (94%) and temperatures (69-80°C) without even holding 144fps on ultra@1440p. Cyberpunk 2077 on ultra@1440p runs better and my rtx 4080 stays cooler (max 60°C) doing so. This doesn't feel right.
72 fps cap, high preset, shadows and reflexions on medium feels good enough while the gpu cools down to 38°C.

However, this game at least runs stable. I had no framerate drops, no stuttering, no crashes or bugs. This already puts it miles above a lot of AAA releases of the past couple years. And the game is also very enjoyable. Every dialogue is voiced so far, even when discussing contracts with mercenaries. The mercenaries seem to have opinions of one another, so they may like or dislike eachother and demand more money if you expect them to work with someone they dislike. I really love that they are not randomly generated pawns lacking any identity like in so many other games. I still find it a bit hard to judge accuracy, frankly. Having no clear read like in, say, Xcom, makes it a bit vague. So I can order them to ""aim""in different levels. The more action points you invest for them taking aim carefully, the better the accuracy. But I find it still hard to tell how much impact it has. However the game seems highly moddable and I read the devs have supposedly already put a mod on the workshop that makes accuracy visible. I will not use it, since I like the idea and just need time to get a feel for it I think.

JA2 is in my top 3 games of all time, so it was absolutely painful to see the franchise butchered by several absolutely awful relaunches over the years. Finally! Devs did it justice - they have kept everything that was great about JA2 and built on top of it using modern tech. 

So anyone who enjoyed JA2 - this is even better! And anyone who never played JA2, here is the summary of why it was a great game (and all of this is even better in JA3):

In-depth Strategy: The game offered a perfect blend of real-time strategy and turn-based combat, making it deeply strategic. Players needed to manage not only their mercenaries in battle but also the economy, resources, and population morale of the territories they control.

Character Diversity: The game featured a wide array of mercenaries, each with their unique skills, personalities, and voice lines. This made the game more immersive as players could choose the right combination of mercenaries based on their playstyle.

Immersive Storyline: The political intrigue and rebellion against a dictator in a fictional country added depth to the gameplay. It successfully blended action, strategy, and narrative.

Replayability: The gameplay varied each time due to the randomized events, unique character interactions, and different strategies players could use to win the game. This made it highly replayable.

Interactive Environment: The game featured a fully destructible environment, which opened up strategic possibilities during combat. Players could use explosives to create new paths or destroy cover, adding an extra layer to the strategy.

Skill Progression System: Mercenaries improved their skills by practicing or using them in combat, which added an RPG-like progression system to the game. This system allowed for extensive character customization and added depth to the gameplay.

Non-linear Gameplay: Players had the freedom to choose their missions and approach them in their own style. This non-linear structure made each player's experience unique and personalized.

Detailed Tactical Combat: The isometric tactical combat system was detailed and engaging, with factors like weapon range, visibility, stance, and fatigue playing crucial roles.

Moddability: The game's mod-friendly design allowed for extensive player-made content, expanding the game's lifespan and appeal. The community developed many mods, adding new features, missions, characters, and more to the game.

Humor and Charm: Despite its strategic depth and complex gameplay, Jagged Alliance 2 was filled with humor and charm, which further enhanced its appeal. From the witty dialogues to the unique character quirks, it kept players entertained throughout.

Overall, Jagged Alliance 2 stood out as a deep, engaging, and rewarding strategy game, making it one of the classics in the genre.",1689532610,1689532610,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wanted to be proved wrong about this one, that I was just an old grognard that hates new games and lives in the past. But mechanically, JA3 is utterly vapid and I was vindicated in my suspicions.

Sir-Tech Canada put so much love and effort into JA2, that much is clear. Autistic detail, some might say, but it was that detail that made the game something we still play today.

JA3 is a shell of a JA game.

Consider the very first mission in JA2, where the chopper drops you off in the first location in Arulco and you have to find your contact.

You're combat dropped into the middle of a battle, pretty much. You have just enough time to get behind some sandbags and scout a bit, and then the enemy is on you. The map is large, you have dozens of ways to approach the battle ahead of you. There are a good few enemies and they're positioned in different places each time you play. There are a dozen or more buildings for you to fight in and around, and they're all individually drawn and modelled. 

After the battle, you need to search the area for clues, and figure out how to find your contact. You spend some time looting the bombed out shelters, and trying to figure out where to go next.

You have to talk to characters after the battle, say the right stuff, and they'll lead you to another area where you have to have a longish conversation with a bunch of rebels, meet people, have dialogue options and decide whether to take on new staff or not. You end up in a bunker underground talking with some guerillas, and it almost goes wrong because they're rough around the edges and you're a bunch of dumb mercs. There's not one, but two characters here you can recruit.

After this, you've got an open-ended campaign ahead of you. Do you trek east, facing constant patrols to get to a smaller but easier to hold mine, or go west, clear out a larger town and take the better value mine there? Of course, that triggers a huge counter-attack that you need to be ready for...

The options you face after that first battle are endless: it's a true open-world sandbox.


Now look at the opening to JA3.

You walk through the same bit of territory to the first three enemies, fought out in a tiny clearing. Then you go to a house and you have a four paragraph info-dump conversation with someone, with no meaningful dialogue options at all, and then you automatically move on rails onto the next location, for another battle you'll have to play in exactly the same way each time you play it.

This is based on a 20 year old game, transitioned to 3D graphics (limited), with the strategic depth cut back in numerous ways, and still using 20 year old system that dont hold up anymore.

For anyone who is familiar with JA2, this is not nearly as in-depth or fleshed out.  This does capture the feel of Jagged Alliance, if JA was ported to mobile.  The merc personalities are fun and the voice lines are good.

The art style is nice but the UI is a little clunky and many actions require keyboard shortcuts since there is no associated UI element.
Customization/appearance options are ZERO.  Mercs do not show what gear they are wearing.  Your custom-made merc has 3 options for male and 3 for female.  None are great and can't be changed.
No walking.  Mercs either run everywhere or crouchwalk.  Not enough animation budget and this is noticeable in other areas.

Maps are small.  Tactical positioning opportunities are very limited, especially with half a dozen mercs and a dozen enemies all on the same map.  As soon as a fight starts, it will resolve with very little change in positioning, mostly just adjusting for cover.  You don't get much room to move before a fight is forced, either forward or back to tactically fall back.

Guns are balanced in an arcade fashion.  They have to be considering the short engagement ranges on small maps.  SMGs are weak and have abysmal range, shotgun are almost point blank only options, AR/MGs are king for multi-target versatility, and marksman rifles are one of the few ways to get consistent one/two shit kills.
Guns are weak.  You can headshot an enemy 4 times before they go down... unarmored.  Unless you're sniping.
Combined/related to low gun damage is the high health pool of enemies.  I havent played a shooter with bullet sponges this bad since Division 2.

Stealth is almost unusable.  Stealth kills before combat are a waste of time; one hit kills on unaware enemies is RANDOM and if you dont succeed then youre at a disadvantage when combat starts.  There are more dedicated stealth oriented mercs, so I guess you use them because RNG for everyone else is garbage.  Oh and an enemy facing away from you will eventually hear you even if youre behind them in full cover a fair distance away not moving, but without a specialized stealth merc.  I guess my merc farted.

You cannot pause in the pre-combat phase to set up your mercs properly.  Its realtime, one at a time and the game doesnt even pause when enemies are sighted, get close, are becoming aware, etc.  If you like RTS tactical shooters, thats what it feels like for the first 15 seconds before the first bullet flies.. and its usually the enemy's because they spotted you when you didnt even see them offscreen.

Enemies clearly do not follow the same action point system mercs do.  Either that or the enemey has genetically modified supersoldiers who can 1) be shot in the head 3 times b) run 15 feet while jumping over a low fence and around chest high barrels c) run behind you, and then d) turn around and shoot you.  all on one turn!  They are also deadly accurate when shooting you in the head with burst fire while youre behind half-height cover.  Half height cover in this game is useless (except to actually take cover behind which uses your whole turn/actions).

There is no economy of buying/selling guns.  If you find a merchant, they may sell 2 guns.  And wont buy.  All money comes from running around maps looting/stealing from locals after a fight.
No vehicles.
No swimming.
Lots of unlikeable NPCs.

And the graphics issues.  Lots of reports of instability or incompatability with higher end setups and options.  I am fully capable of 1440p but I had to run 1080 with medium settings until I turned reflections and AO off (on/off are the only options here).  Also neither resolution plays ncie with my multi-monitor setup.  Alt-tabbing works but this game and WIndows 10 fight over resolution switching and monitor offset settings.

So... if you want some XCOM turn based action on a small scale with troops who have actual personalities, but you want slimmed down strategic management, and you are OK with most of the issues I've mentioned... then Id recommend JA3.  On sale.  Half price or lower.

I love JA2.  A lot.  I like JA3.. a little.  But less as my time with the game goes on.

Oh and lastly.. mods.  There is mod support coming.  No one knows the extent  or ease of the mod tools.  A lazy excuse to the issues I noted is ""wait for mods"".  No, core gameplay issues should be part of the base game content.",1689530505,1689530505,False,234,6,0.779546558856964111,0,True,False,False

- I will not bother going through the positives of the game.
- The game does not deserve the price tag.
- There is no pause! Dear developers, is this your first tactical game? Setting ambushes is very hard.
- The player cannot see hit percentages. Detailed information is hidden from the player (Update: due to the massive backlash the developers have released a mod showing hit percentages (They should have known better)).
- Killed enemies do not drop their inventory.
- Even JA2 BIA from 2012 was able to model the vest, helmet and trousers worn by the player or the AI. It is not  a thing in JA 3 Mobile even in 2023. Shame!
- Where is the gun store?
- No auto-renew contract option for your mercenaries.
- Replayability is low.
- Training militia mechanic is watered down. The previous titles had a wonderful mechanic, the player would provide weapons and armor for the militia therefore making the loot very essential. It is not here!
- Mining the enemy squad approaches is no longer an option. Persistency of the maps are thrown out of the window.
- Bad UI. Questionable default key bindings.
- No way to assign groups or keys for the squad members such as 1 or F1. Entire key bindings have to be reconsidered. 
- Burst fire and full auto is completely useless. Weapon spread is terrible even with 90+ aim. 
- When your character decides to roll a miss with the maximum aim, the bullet goes to the roof of the building 30 meters to the right of the torso you are aiming at.
- I found myself battling with the camera more than the enemy squads.
- Maps are small and almost half of them feel very empty.
- Cover mechanic is not properly working.
- Bullet sponge bosses.
- Very bad stealth mechanics. 
- Melee is not a viable option. Make a silencer for that Kar98 and be done with it.
- Sometimes the game stucks during loading a savegame.
- No squad member fatigue during the tactical phase.
- There is no difference in between an MG42 and two sets of lockpicks inventory management wise. Items have no weight. Why?
- Fully automated AI controlled (!) wooden spotlights.
- No minimap.

Conclusion: What we have is not a bad squad based tactical game similar to the dozens of similar big titles but does not deserve to be called a Jagged Alliance game. It feels like the game is targeting 12 to 16 year old fortnite players, definitely not me. Everything is dumbed down and simplified. THQ Nordic and Haemimont Games has dropped the ball. I would be more satisfied if they had re-made the JA 2 BIA with modern graphics WITHOUT touching any of the mechanics even the AI.

I’m torn right now. The spirit of JA is there with JA3 but I just can’t help feel the developers/ head honchos sided to play it safe when developing as point and shooter with mass marketing / gameplay appeal over a gritty tactical squad m/ment game. I feel trying to appeal to mass market reduces the depth JA are uniquely well loved for. 

If more substance is added this game could be a gem. 

Pros 
- The voice acting and classic JA one liners, quips is back. 
- Quality sound track, backing music. 
- Top graphics to the maps, mercs, explodable buildings etc 
- Campaign story and side quests - still give choose own adventure with an overall goal. 

Cons 
-  Wounding enemies should have an effect. Like Bleeding, panic etc that effects m/ment points, decision making and accuracy. 
- Haven’t yet been offered to recruit in game mercs. (Only played a few hours so far) Like in JA2 you get given some free mercs plus discover Conrad etc. 
- Not many squad leaders recruit/veteran level mercs with leadership to choose from. 
- No online ordering site/Bobby Rays 
- No night vision googles? 
- No chopper - pilot as transport option.
- Modified weapon parts don’t seem interchangeable but fixed once use you modify. 
- No selling guns, animal parts, bounty hunting etc?

The style is here, the humor is here, and it has the energy of JA2. Unfortunately, in addition to ignoring the popular functions added by JA2 1.13, JA3 also takes several steps backwards from JA2's core experience. For example, combat is turn-based, but sneaking around to ambush enemies is done exclusively in real time. The game does not pause while you navigate the aimed shot GUI to choose a target location. You will end up quick-loading dozens of times to try and aim a melee attack before the AI either moves away or detects you and initiates combat with a free move. Needlessly frustrating things like this sour the experience of what is otherwise a pretty solid successor to JA2.

They've also made the choice to fully embrace asymmetric gameplay a la X-COM, where enemy equipment deletes itself once they are slain and enemies do not use the same health system you do; their action points and combat performance are not reduced by taking critical damage, etc. That works when you're fighting mind-controlled aliens, but against human opponents it is frankly puzzling.

It is probably the best Jagged Alliance since Sir-Tech's JA2; If you are a hard core JA2 fan or 1.13 fan, you may want to wait for a sale, hope for changes, or skip it. While it's not all bad, it has some deficiencies in mechanics, charm, character, and subtleties. I will give it a positive overall because there is enough good to latch on to.

Just for references, with the exception of JA: Rage, I've played every ptjer Jagged Alliance game. I have yet to finish this game and it seems like I am about 1/3 the way through. 

On it's own merit, the game is probably a C+ maybe even a B- (79-80/100, 4/5 stars) It is fun and frustrating at the same time. I am not sure how Sir-Tech did it, but JA2 has a magic no one may be able to capture again. Now on to my overly long review where I may miss some points.

You can see the passion that Haemimont Games had for this franchise.  The music, the different biomes, the aesthetics in each sector is all pretty great.  The story is pretty good, at least I've enjoyed it - feels like an 80s/90s action film story.  The Strategy layer feels more difficult to me than JA2 and I think that's a positive.  I have been in many situations where I barely had enough money to extend my merc contracts by 3 days (the minimum.) 

On the downside, you can also see that the execution as a whole is lacking. I am not sure if it was lack of design focus, they ran out of money, or just a lack of community involvement (they probably should have taken a page from Larian here.)  I think there were some bad or lazy design choices. In some places it really lacks soul or charm.

The UI while somewhat modern doesn't feel too much better. The laptop or PDA seem lackluster. Where is the ""Where are they now"" section of AIM?  I don't care for the reticle lockup compared to default free aim of JA2, but it's not a deal breaker. The game needs some optimization passes for sure, it's looks good enough, but should definitely run better since it's not over the top graphically. 

Writing is okay in some places, bad in others. I am not sensitive to political incorrectness, but some of the quips are poorly written and/or lack the soul/charm of JA2.  

Your favorite JA2 Mercs have changed. Many AIM mercs feel quite a bit different than their JA2 counterparts which I count as bad. I understand that they are using a different perk system, but some completely shifted their game play from JA2. Another thing I miss is the animated portraits from JA2.

I was disappointed that there were only 6 IMP models and no choice for voices.  This should be double in my opinion from the Dev, not modders. The PET exam was a nice homage. I appreciate the Mercs expressing their personality/culture thru their clothing; however, some pull on immersion.   [b]One BIG gripe[/b] is that armor is not modeled on mercs or NPC avatars. You are fighting against shirtless/hat-less factions, in the early game at least, and when you go to shoot them you will see they have armor on represented only by icons on the body part aiming reticle.  Overall, it would be more immersive, aesthetically pleasing, and just cool to have all avatars show their armor above their clothing/skin so we can tell they have armor and if/when it breaks (should just disappear from the model).  This is definitely one of the worst design decisions made in my opinion.

Combat is another place where I find fun, but also with lots of frustrations. The enemy gets a reposition action when they detect you and we don't get to pause/plan during the Real Time portion. There does not seem to be a way to set up synced shots, so in practice this free move feels bad since you are usually outnumbered.  I'd rather them take away the reposition and give the enemies 1-2 more men per ""squad"".  Speaking of enemies, most seem to have 100+ Health, 90+ Marksmanship, and Auto Fire perk because they will hit you all with burst fire from long range all day long. 

Suppression doesn't feel authentic as it only works happens on full auto. If your whole team fires at one target, they don't get rattled. The ""throw you one square to prone"" mechanic from explosives in JA2 is not here.  Not sure how status affects enemies, but they don't look or seem slower, less lethal, or even rattled when heavily wounded/ near death. 

[b]Maps are too small.[/b] Fog of war is a bit messy.  You see all of the map of a zone, which is fine, but I guess your mercs have a 360 degree vision cone around them as I havent noticed a difference in fog of war behind the mercs vs in front of the mercs. I haven't noticed if enemies can sneak up on you.  

With maps being too small, the weapons have very truncated ranges (at least the ones I've found), characters seem they can run farther than their weapons effective range. I know JA2 had some weird truncated weapon ranges (and damage).  I don't really understand how to read weapon damage in JA3, but similar to JA2, they don't make much sense since damage should be consistent with caliber. I am not sure that weapons have damage fall off after their effective range - I suspect they don't.

Due to enemies being amazing shots and your mercs being so-so (causing durability to suffer), the amount of time you will be doing Satellite Operations is daunting which will really slow you down and cause money issues.  

I cannot think of much more at this time, I may revisit this if I find more extremely frustrating mechanics or the Devs decide to make some changes, which they should.",1689522070,1689522377,True,128,0,0.777756094932556152,0,True,False,False

Turn based combat, squad management, goofy characters, desctructible environments, multiple ways of approaching missions. The size of the maps are smaller but have more content in them. The NPC voice acting is quite good.

Whats not good: No more shopping for your favorite instruments of death to a chill tune at bobby rays website, the goofy and over the top characters are toned down for the twitter generation, buggy sound, performance without DLSS-2 is not good, the tacticool gunp*rn is very much toned down

-Character progression
-Characters are unique and fun to mix up
-Resources to manage do not feel like a chore (part of the core experience)
-Classic cheesy action films tropes (what JA is known for)
-I.M.P. (character customize avatar complete with questions or jump straight into it)
-Mod support (the JA community is wonderful)
-Plays like JA where it does not handhold and gives you the player to make decisions how to handle situations. If I (the player) fail, it's on me for making risk/reward decisions or playing a situation more safe.
-Nothing has weight, so pack up all you can.
-A nod to the past (references that JA fans will like) while moving forward with a cleaner interface and noticeable improvements to make the combat tense and satisfying.
-Knife feels useful. (Igor is great mercenary!)

Not sure:
-Overwatching is strong, really strong for both sides. Bobby laid waste to an encampment with a heavy tower machine gun he fixed up. (That was amazing map design by the way.) However, my IMP avatar can counter an enemy with an ability I got at level 2, so I think it's okay for both sides.

Con: (modding might change these things)
-A way to notice an enemy that can't be seen. (Maybe a blip in a general area if a character can heard it with no visuals.)
-To continue that point, interruption if something is noticed.
-No online shop like in JA2 (so far)
-Gold membership from A.I.M. for a few legendary mercs like my favorite, Magic. I understand from a balance perspective/progression, but not the biggest fan of having to pay money to hire mercenaries for more money. Perhaps only playing for hours (offline so not tracked on my review) that I'm just slow and need to move faster to get more mines.
-Cannot choose to go into combat mode. It's just automatic.

Overall:
JA3 is finally the game fans have wanted for years after a few flops to capture the spirit. The game devs said they didn't want to mess up, and they accomplished task. With modding support with in game tools, JA3 has the ability to go even further.  JA3 does not feel like it's just for fan; JA3 captures the essence while being modern and hopefully bring in a new generation of gamers to the series.",1689515669,1689515669,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After that I played Jagged Alliance 2 and Unfinished business (together with the many excellent modes that has been released over the years). Jagged Alliance is one of my favorite franchise but after the second installment (and its sequel/mods) it has pretty much gone downhill.  

Numerous Jagged alliance titles have been released since jagged alliance 2  and none of them (in my opinion) have been good and after 20 something years I had given up hope to ever see a “true” jagged alliance game.

So when Jagged Alliance 3 was announced I was skeptical to say the least (I have been burnt before) and for a long time I remained skeptical. Not only did the announce a jagged alliance  but they had the audacity to refer to it as a mainline title. However as time progressed and information about the game was being dropped my interested started to increase and I thought I will give it a chance.

So I am now a bit into the game, around 11 hours (I left the “tutorial island” and I am on the mainland and have been for several hours) and this is my impressions so far.

This game is not Jagged Alliance 2 nor is it trying to be. It aims to be the  “true” sequel to jagged alliance 2 and in my opinion its succeeds and then some. It is hard to state all the things the game does and that is good but to give a few examples: the combat is great and fun, the mercs all have their own personalities (as in the original games), there is a interplay between tactical game and strategic game (or satellite view as it is called within the game). There are tons of guns, grenades, modifications and so on.  The world feels alive and organic and outside of combat there are quests and fun and interesting characters to meet. When it comes to graphics it looks really nice. Sound is really good and the music is fantastic.  It mixes humor with serious tactical combat. It is a jagged alliance game and a really good evolution from the second game. 

There are things that I am still trying to get used to. For example in jagged alliance 2 there was a webb-based gun and ammo shop so you could order ammo. As far as a know this game has no such thing. As far as I can tell this my made intentionally to make things a bit more challenging from jagged alliance 2 (I never had ammo shortage in that game). In this game, as far as I can tell, you are more supposed to craft ammunition. It also took some time to get used to the enemy redeployment phase (but once I got used to and and got in to the habit of laying ambushes it became a fun mechanic). I find the humour really fun but I understand that it might not be for everyone. 

There is vocal group that does not like this game. Some people wanted Jagged alliance 2 with better graphics and so on and this game it clearly not that.  Some other people have other issued with the game that they don't like and that is fine as well. I am however annoyed by some of the people who are calling this an “asset-flip” or a “money grab” and so on. These arguments are not in good faith and are really just nonsense to be honest. You can clearly tell this a passion-project by the developers (just take a look at all the streams to see their passion for this franchise). Also worth mentioning is that Ian Currie (the original creator of jagged alliance) is involved in jagged alliance as a writer and advisor. 

This is the sequel to jagged alliance 2 that I have been waiting for these many years and I am very happy that the developers did the franchise right. I hope this is the start of many more great jagged alliance games.

- Story seems good, Lots of parodies and comedic conversation, feels like JA

Unfortunately, in my personal opinion, after almost 30 hours walkthrough, games did not live up to them. Even though it's decent, like 5 or 6 out of 10, I cant say that it was fun in the later half. 
First, I would like to just compare it a little bit against JA2:
- There is less sectors and locations themselves are not that big at all (remember Alma's facilities? or Unfinished business ones?)
- Weapons variety is not that great and what is worse, quite often you use what you have to, since you dont have that much ammo, but not what you want to. Ammo is the problem, but not in a way you cant win in the game, it's just prevents fun. Got new HK 21? Want to try? Get rekt, you have 80 7.62x51 NATO ammo left, know your place. I really dont like when game restricts player from having fun, but this is the case in JA3. Okay, we cant produce, we cant buy ammo- them please make an honest loot system, which allows you to loot everything/at least guns which every enemy has.
- Militia training, etc- worse! you could move militia squads in original game inside cities, you could have up to 20 in sectors, not like 8
- Map movement- worse! no helicopters, no cars
- Trade is a joke, in JA2/JA2:Unfinished business you could order guns and their delivery, you could trade with merchants all over the game world and trade had better interface, lol.
- Resource management. Money and ammo - is abysmal and not fun. Yeah, in original game mines could deplete, but it did not contain some kind of constant timer, which was telling you- please, finish or progress in the way devs want or you will be without money. Overall main pressure was coming from enemy's actions on map and squads of elites you didnt give a f until you handle them yourself. 
- Stealth is bad. Really bad. It has own set of rules like when you could not effectively clean up location even when you hit an enemy who cant see you...but you dont kill him and now he can. I really enjoyed night ops on JA2 (I was stupid enough to go to Alma after Drassen there and got UV goggles first time I played JA2), it was fun, enemy had flares in JA2:UB, but here- useless IMO.
There can be other points where JA2 is just straight better, but these are main ones I didnt like.
Apart from it there are a number of points I didnt like themselves:
- Setting. Almost 0 amount of big cities. Remember Alma? Grom? remember final city with the palace? forget them. 
- Difficulty. With a plot twist you have to overcome elites at some point of  game...and they are stronger than enemies in last sectors. This means one simple thing - you have difficulty cap in the middle of the game, then it's easy road. Last location can be kinda challenging, if not I had 0 fcks given and just blown everything with grenade launchers. 
There is a number of good points, which I have to say since review has to be honest:
- Different outcomes of decisions - yep, game gives you multiple choices and you can fck up many times. Role playing part of the game is really decent and even better than in games like XCOM, etc. It's not Divinity, but it's decent. 
- Game felt really good in the middle with introduction of new fraction.
- Combat mechanics can give you some fun
But overall, based on my personal experience, I would not recommend it until you're hardcore fan of genre.

What was lost:
- No inventory micro management. I wish they could bring back at least a half of the old system.  You also can exchange items between mercs through 1 screen
- You don't find attachments to guns. You craft them. How do you craft a 8x hunting scope you ask? Here take a lens you found in a trash bin and voila!
- Combat is very x-com'y You still have old mechanics but now they are mixed with a new mechanichs of the most recent X-com. I can't say I hate it but I also can't say I like it
- No Bobby Ray's shop
- Weapon balance is terrible imo. It will be fixed in the future
- Main villain loses to Deidrana in terms of Charisma.

What we have:
- More interactions with civilians who give us quests
- Campy atmosphere of 80s movies is still there
- Mercs have great personalities as in original
- Money an ammo is a problem which is good
- It definetly feels like JA 
- Mines and quite a huge map is there
- Wide variety of guns but due to bad balance it's an issue for now
- Coop multiplayer

So what is the final verdict?

The interface is confusing. It's a pretty clear ""I know how it works"" from the developer without usability. The game has no tutorial and one of the most pathetic set of help pages I've ever seen. Figuring how to do to something like a stealth kill is a matter of trial and error. 

In fact, just moving around in real time is a pain. There's some neat stuff you could do to set yourself up if you could pause real-time and give orders, but you can't so you have to hope you don't get seen. The enemies don't have vision cones, just some rather questionable sight-line things I don't entirely get. And you have no idea where your fog of war is except that enemies disappear. Also, in combat you can tell if you're moving to cover, not out of combat. What does cover do? Who knows. Am I hidden, why was I found? Don't know.

This is the game's key problem - there's no way of knowing things. I can hit someone in 5 places and I have an idea of the different damage, but I can never get a hit probability anywhere, or what armor does, or what ANYTHING does. We need numbers and the game screws the pooch by hiding them. How can I choose the right hit or the right anything without numbers?
For example, Ice has ""Auto Weapons"" which gives him ""Reduced Accuracy Penalty when using Burst Fire or Full Auto."" I don't know what the normal Accuracy Penalty is for these things, I don't know how much it's reduced, but I don't know what the hit chances is in the first place. At least I have a crit chance (assuming there aren't modifiers).

The characters also have many stats. The game tells me what they do, but doesn't provide any mechanical context. I have no idea how important any of these things are. Also, there's nothing useful for the personality details.

The developers know the game engine so it works fine for them; players are in the dark. If you're someone who doesn't care to know and just wants to press buttons, you probably don't play these games. I suppose you could lab every situation forever to figure it out.

This isn't a matter of having mystery. When you can't know the right strategic choice, it kills the strategy. You're playing chess without knowing what the other player's pieces are.

The interface under-uses buttons. There's a sad lack of right click menu options, and sometimes you need the left button and sometimes you need the right button. Example - outside of combat you move by clicking with the right button, inside you use the left button. Inventory management is clunky. You can't split a pile in the team reserves, you have to move it to a merc and then you can split it. And what do the items do? It's limited at times.

The game hides most of the important menus in the command button. In fact, many of the elements are based on using the keyboard. Hint to developers: if you must use a keyboard shortcut you messed up. You're stuck in the 1990s. These things are not discoverable.

All of this is unfortunate because of the excellent presentation. It largely gets the merc voice idea right, and the game is a pleasure to look at. 

Please give us the numbers, real-time and in the menus, then give us about 100x as many help pages. Fix this game.",1689508337,1689508337,False,6,0,0.538203179836273193,0,True,False,False

It's essentially you running a mercenary company to help free an island chain of some tyrant. 

The cool things you get to do, are hire mercs with various different abilities, providing you can afford them.
Earn cash from helping the locals, loot badguys for new equipment and ammo, try not to die.
 
Aside from all the usual hijinks with TBS, you have some additional layers such as treating wounds, training your own mercs, training the locals to defend themselves, travelling to and from the islands takes time and costs cash. You can hire as many mercs as you can afford, in groups of 1 to a maximum of 8 per group.. again, this costs money. 
Scouting operation can reveal intel and can be a source of cash, ammo, and weapons etc.. they also take time.. 

Honestly there are so many layers and ways to play through this, it's almost a sandbox. 
If turn based strategy is your thing, give it a shot. It's worth the punt.

- the ever-repeating ""funny"" banter of the mercs; every damn time I click on one
- there is no real shop to buy ammo or weapons (or armor); later you can find ""traders"" who have weapons to sell on a table (one gun per table), but you have to buy them blind
- there is a NPC that sells you lootboxes (!) for diamonds
- you can craft special ammo out of basic, but not the basic itself
- you, as a professional merc, start out with your clothes, a rusty gun and 10 bullets - once you train militia in a dirt-poor village, they run around in body armor toting auto rifles
- I did not find a PDF manual explaining stuff; I am aware that there is in-game help, but a PDF is not too much to ask for I think...including weapon statistics for example
- I am not sure what higher level mercs are good for...the low levels don't have worse stats (one comes with 100 DEX), so it seems to boil down to their personal feat; not sure that is worth the exorbitant fee

- all NPCs get to find cover when you shoot at someone, and movement rules be damned
- you get to move like 11 steps and are out of action points; the NPCs can run that far and still shoot; kinda unfair, don't you think?

The status of 'nearly dead' will see enemies run half a football field and unload a fully auto mag at that football field's distance with uncanny accuracy.

Then to add to the unfairness, I'm talking to an NPC and without warning my entire party is injured...for no good reason. Something explodes and everyone is injured...is this the fun part? No. There isn't a fun part. 

Sometimes mercs with 85 marksman skill with new weapons will miss single fire shots at near point blank range while guerrillas can hit you very accurately from double the distance at full auto. What is this?? No wonder they got rid of CTH. If they showed you and you saw the results you COULD very well call shenanigans. 

You can sneak up on an enemy with a knife and instead of killing the guy IT JUST DOES A LITTLE DAMAGE?? What? Why is it not slitting the guy's throat??

If you have a group of enemies making a counter attack to your sector even though you are already leaving and they have yet to arrive YOU CANNOT SIMPLY CONTINUE TO LEAVE THE SECTOR but they CAN attack. 

You never know how close to being tired your mercs are. They just are or they aren't and one of my mercs has so few AP's that he can barely fire his weapon when fully rested and healthy! How long till my merc levels up? Don't know that, either. 

Why is Fidel Dahan whiter than I am?

I'm so disappointed. I was looking for a fair, balanced game and what I have is an RNG that massively favours the opponents with clunky, unintuitive menus and controls. Save, load, save, load until it favours you. There is no skill involved, just a lot of frustration and repitition.

I have changed my review to Not recommended because the whole Stealth Kill system is useless, After using it your character doesn't go back into Stealth mode and stay up instead of going back to Crouch Stealth, so EVERY time you kill someone you'll get caught. And sometime you need to pass over a little wall to go sneak kill someone but you can't the character don't want to cross it so you have to get in front of the enemies and start the fight..

With that in mind, I started to play JA3 with a very critical attitude, but seems like this one is finally a decent sequel to the series. 

So far my biggest gripe is that map seem to be too small. Not much room to be tactical like in JA2. 
The UI feels a bit clunky but I guess it will be okay after a while.

Action, dialogue, music etc. seems good. I liked the voice acting of the characters I hired and met. Overall there's a nice ambience in the game.

On a sidenote I really miss ""Unusually Ruthless"" Reuban from JA1, if the team is planning to release DLCs with more mercs, I'd love if Reuban with his cordless hedge trimmer would get another chance.

The animations are janky and it lacks rag-doll physics and destructive environment. The mercs sprinting through the environment like they are on floating treadmills needs more realism.

The game claims to be open world but it definitely doesn't feel like an open world concept from JA games in the past. It feels somewhat unfinished and needed more time in the oven with the animations and combat.

I would like to see a planning system like the one in JA Back in Action. You could systematically plan a series of commands and waypoints for each merc.",1689349823,1689489059,False,47,8,0.41517329216003418,2,True,False,False

1084160,142180529,76561197975054782,0,74,7452,0,647,1704511756,"As someone who has sacrificed too much of his youth to JA2, I am happy to report that this is indeed a Jagged Alliance game, and it's very enjoyable. You've probably seen reviews where hardcore old-timer JA2 fanboys are nitpicking over the game, and yes, they absolutely are nitpicking. The main thing they agonize over is the inventory management, authenticity, and other crap that is all about splitting hairs and not being made by game designers back in 1999. Don't bother with them.

I could go on for a long time, but for the sake of this review I'll go talk about two big things I really appreciate about JA3: the UI design, and stealth mechanics. 

The UI is really well done. It's not perfect, but it's a MASSIVE improvement to JA2. There are a lot of systems at play here - armor, penetration, grazing hits, weather, time of day, fatigue, merc management, etc. Whoever build their UI and tooltip system deserves a raise and a few awards, because I fully understand everything that's happening while I'm playing the game. It's the reason why I've been able to play the game with a single-save state and I haven't restarted my run yet. All the systems are explained to you up front, without taking too much of your time, and popups remind you what certain systems do. It's great.

The stealth mechanics are awesome. JA2's biggest flaw (even with mods) is how absolutely clunky and terrible stealth is. It tells you nothing, it's seemingly random, and is save-scummy as hell.
But JA3's stealth absolutely works, and it's my favorite thing about it so far. The game tells you when you're hidden, when the enemy starts to detect you. And when you get detected, you basically get one turn to make things right. If you succeed and wipe them out, you're good. If you fail, it turns into a stand-up fight. And even then, unless you make a huge ruckus of explosions or loud weaponry (weapon noises vary from silent, to normal, to loud, to very loud), you won't necessarily tip off the whole rest of the map. It feels fair, and that's just such a rare thing when it comes to stealth systems in turn-based tactical games.

As an aside, there is some simplification done, notably in the inventory management department, but I don't mind it. I'm no longer a young man with too much time on his hands, so I don't want to spend ages shuffling specific magazines into specific mercs and loading specific ammunition into each of those mags. Haemimont still kept in the complexity into the tactical and overworld gameplay, and thankfully spared enough of it from inventory management, and I'm grateful for it.

And even if you don't like something in JA3, guess what, mod tools (including 3d model tools, apparently) ship with the game. So if you want 1000+ items of LBE pouches, chest rigs, plate carriers, and enough magazines to make you puke, or tweak some system you disagree with you can go ahead and make it happen.

Enjoy the game, it's rare we get a JA game that's actually good and well designed. Great job Haemimont.",1689488561,1689488561,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For another entry to the turn-based tactics genre, it's a pretty neat addition. If you've played Wasteland 2 or 3 or the Divinity series, you'll probably feel some familiarity of taking control of a small force made of unique individuals across an open world.  

The tactical depth of combat is decent. Better than XCOM's or Wasteland's, especially with the individual body parts targeting (daym groin shots really?), but not as creative as Divinity's. There's a bunch of other stuff you can do during combat (like blowing up cars or making enemies fall off 2nd floors) to make things more fun. 

Management and logistics can be a pain at times. It's entirely possible to run out of meds or find a gun and not have any ammo for it whatsoever for a long time. But so far, nothing that would call for a game over...unless you play on ""those"" difficulties.

The characters are mostly fun and interesting and some are even affiliated with each other personally and have their own unique dialogue when interacting. But don't get me wrong, there are the bad eggs...like Kalyna and her annoying 3-year old child-esque dialogue. 

Overall, the game is pretty good and is worth a shot especially if you're into turn-based squad tactics games. I can sympathize with the veterans of the franchise when they say JA3 pales in comparison to the previous games (I felt the same way with Borderlands 3 and Company of Heroes 3 when they were released) but if you don't mind something ""different"" or if, like me, you're completely new and have little to no exposure and expectations, you should give JA3 a go.

...Because it doesn't have to be Jagged Alliance 2. A lot of the reviewers of this game are criticizing it for making so many design decisions that makes it far and away different from the 1999 release. 

JA3 feels like a genuine sequel that adopts a lot of core gameplay mechanics from recent tactical RPGs and weaves in the usual Jagged Alliance atmosphere of really witty puns and pop culture references. While not very high praise, I can say with absolute certainty that this is definitely [i]better[/i] than JA: Back in Action. It actually feels like a legit Jagged Alliance game, for one.

Only real issue I have with it is that the real time sections in between the combat could use a lot of polishing. It's kind of hard to set up your teams appropriately on maps that allow you to hide behind cover to ambush the enemy and, usually, they'll spot you before you even really have a chance to react.

The out of combat real time mode is missing alot of quality of life features. You can attempt stealth takedowns in this game but they're extremely stat dependent and without a pause/order queing feature it becomes an exercise in bumblef**king and giving the wrong orders because setting up your troops is a race against the good 'ol detection meter. Melee ambushes in general are a joke because I've yet to find a character that can hit anyone reliably, nothing beats sneaking up on a guy for a backstab and either missing or just getting standard, non lethal damage.

It's 2023, and your mercenaries won't make any effort to avoid mines when giving move orders. Game's got plenty of minefields and you'll be ushering your guys one at a time because the devs can't be bothered to develop good pathfinding AI.

More RPG than tactics, I'd even go so far as to call this a mummorpuger. The game seems to be level locking sections of the map. In previous JA games you could tough out difficult opponents and get their high quality gear after. Here you wander into the wrong area and you'll just be doing severely decreased damage for random rewards that aren't all that likely to pay off because enemies for the most part aren't lootable. 

I shit you not, random reader, but there was one guy that ate around 5 headshots at ~25 damage each. Unlike the player characters, which lose action points and accuracy as they accrue damage, 150 head HP guy spent all his turns peppering the squad with full auto machine gun fire with no loss to accuracy (only arm damage loses accuracy, huh) every single turn, with no need to reload.

Initially, I was a bit disappointed that a lot of the core of the game has been somewhat streamlined, but the fact is that most of the DNA that made the first two games so good is here and it was created by people who understand the key features that make JA stand out from the crowd. 

This is the first time in 24 years I can say that this new Jagged Alliance is a worthy addition to the franchise and I hope that it helps other people discover what makes it special, as well as encourages them to check out the old games, JA2 specifically.

JA2 is hands down one of the greatest and deepest tactical games ever created, it would have been extremely difficult to replicate every  single system in that game and translate it to the fully 3D, mostly non-grid based system that JA3 uses, so I think Haemimont games made the right call in prioritising the most important things from those early games, building the rest of JA3 around them, while also managing to modernise it and make it it's own thing. 

It's not all sunshine and roses though, The stealth really feels like more of an afterthought though and it could use some work as well as offering a way to pause the real time mode and issue and queue commands to your squad to make sure you can get that ambush ready in a very short amount of time, because trust me there are going to be moments when you feel like you need it. 

The character creation was also a bit of a step down from JA2, offering a pretty disappointing selection of portraits and seemingly no voice choices this time around? I was looking forward to trying to recreate my usual JA2 character here, but outside of the stats, it's almost impossible to replicate his look and attitude. Hopefully this is something that can be rectified in the way of post launch content updates and/or mod support, the latter of which looks very promising and I can't wait to see what the community comes up with.

I've got over 8 hours in JA3 so far, I will likely update this once I have some more detailed opinions on the game, but if you want my TLDR, it's that this game is NOT Jagged Alliance 2 and it won't replace it, but its still a damn good game and plays to it's own strengths extremely well, even with it's slight frustrations. It looks absolutely beautiful too, with it's highly detailed and unique merc models, high poly assets, weather and biome variation (with actual gameplay effects) and overall gorgeous art style that perfectly fits the mood and feel of the classics.

The developers put a tremendous amount of effort into cut scenes, voice acting and RPG elements which are all lacking in today's ""AAA"" releases. The game seem to be also bug free which is quite an amazing accomplishment in today's games

Just one minor issue with the current game at the moment is discovering loot in the game. The containers won't flash properly / constantly so you WILL miss the containers because you are usually zoomed out when in tactical mode.

Thing i like:
- Map size: most map is not big (i have only just reach main land), for me is a good thing. Remove a lot of moving times in battles (Tactical combat and chasing enemies across big maps, means lots of clicking).

- Nice BGM. From what i can tell Grand Chien is based on Africa, the music really reflects that (especially the singing ones is really good).

- The mercenary you hired has a lot of personality and most of them are quite unique or weird (they can speak and are voiced).

- Combat is mainly based on line of sights, if your mercs don't sees them you don't see them too. This makes positioning and covers very important which makes the combat fun and challenging.

Things i feel can be better:

- Controls and environment interactions, if you select everyone in your team and interact with stuff, the whole lots of them will swamp in. Imagine trying to talk to someone with 5 to 6 people in your face. Nothing major but kind of non immersive, most games i play have leader doing the interactions (rest of the crew will keep a distance).

The game fails in keeping or improving the things I loved JA2 for.

Examples: 
""Streamlines inventory""
-> Ammunition is stored and transported in an invisible Squad inventory. If soilders reload they draw from it.
Some people might argue that makes things more easy and keeps the focus on the game. I disagree, this was part of the game and preparation and added a lot to the feeling. Now gone.

""Forced humor""
-> In Ja2 we could laugh or relate to soldiers comments, the BSE-Test was funny writen but always in a way it felt not to much. 
Now we have over the top forced humor. Most characters i meet so far are try so hard to be funny that it is hard to not skip dialoges. 
The Boom-Kid that blows up anything every few seconds, don t like it.
Weapon granny 100 year old granny acting as arms dealer with a character picture that would even be to much for a comic? Come on!

-> The ""Aim-Bot"".  
Aimbot: Someone spotted herbs. Why?!? Just write it in a log. Herbs spotted.
Why is there failed humor even for such thing as the log

-> Looting: Why the &%&$ do we even loot herbs and parts. Oh right, because crafting and repairing got also streamlined. You want a bipod or a scope or a silencer. Collect weapon parts or transform found weapons into weapon parts then craft what you want.

-> Character system
Great you copied XCOM in some way. Choose perks that makes your merc more mighty.
JA2 was that stats make your soilder there was no perks (except from the up to 2 skills people are created with of course)

-> The fight system
JA2 was you have time units everything costs time units. You can transfert 5 time units to the next round if you save them.
Now we have a convolut of free movement before time units get consumed, free aiming for the first shoot with the right weapon attachments. Perks give more free movement before or after attacks.
Now you could have enemys running half a screen and still shoot at you. (Or do it yourself)
Also the overwatch is a nice idea and probably born to get rid of the JA2 interruption system. But it feels less good then the old system. What was wrong with stat based interruptions if time units got stored?

-> Economy or the famos JA2 Laptop
We have a somewhat rushed copy of it that gives the feeling of getting thrown into the game 3 weeks before release.
You have your A.I.M website and well nothing more.
You expect such things like a financial log. Stramlined!

Health-/Stamina-/Morale-Bar
Streamlined. You have only a health bar (And a new healing system. WHY?!?)
But there is still exhaustion. So enjoy arriving in an enemy sector and have your merc 2 minutes before they arrive tell you ""We are tired!"" Then walk back with ""tired""-Speed and wast a lot of time. Well done streamlining it in a bad way.
-> Laptop Weapon store
I am not far into the game yet, but i fear it is gone. But here we need to make a ""?"" for the moment.

-> The funny movies of Deidranna and Eliot
Replaced by some ""snype"" voiced chat messages. You will have a hard time to not skip them -.-


Is there hope?
Probably yes, because there seem to be mod tools. This gives hope that in a year or so there will be mods out there that maybe make a real JA3 out of the game.

Worth its money?
If you played and loved JA2 -> No, but you can hope for mods making it worth

For lovers of the genre itself, it does not disappoint, however and perhaps out of nostalgia, I prefer Back in Action.


I still haven't had the opportunity to try the coop, it's something I'm curious about and that can be a differential even in simpler mechanics

O modo free do cenário achei confuso e atrapalhado, as vezes esbarra-se em algo aqui e pronto começa um combate que você não queria entrar, algumas mecânicas parecem mais simplistas em relação ao combate, enfim ainda estou me adaptando e para quem curte jogos por turno, sabe que é muito raro ter bons jogos focados em guerra conteporânea nesse estilo.

Big fan of the series and genre, disappointed enough to say give it a few months and check back.

Biggest gripe is there's no pause out of combat and no option to enter turn-based until already aggro'd. Attempts at stealth/ambushes are an exercise in trying to get just the right things clicked in as little time as possible and hoping for the best. This isn't helped by a UI that feels really clunky for 2023. So many clicks to make things happen and find the information you want to help you with your decisions. Except for certain actions that just happen with one click and burn your action points unexpectedly... Very awkward AI in some places.

Sure, I could hang on for Workshop support to fix it. But I'm just not patient about that sort of thing anymore.

The UI is janky. There is no pausing real-time, meaning it is cumbersome to actually try and set up a tactically-sound beginning to an engagement.

Its punishing, which I don't mind (I've played ungodly hours in 1.13). But it feels more arbitrarily punishing. And the AI is pretty exploitable. The combination of arbitrarily punishing and exploitable AI just tells me that the gameplay loop is going to be the same at 30hrs as it was at 3hrs.

At least with 1.13 I knew when I fucked up, why and how to avoid doing so in the future. This just doesn't have the same feedback.

but after some of the down-votes especially on the First day, i kinda feel forced to.
First off the game has everything we asked for in all these years after JA2 and more.
Great tactics, great humor, lots of weapons, many of the classic AIM Members (also i really miss Lynx)... 
hell even a coop-mode which i didn't even know i needed.

Now to some of the down-votes which are just hilarious and outrageous:
- ""Unplayable controls"". -> they could be optimized yes but far from unplayable and this results in instant thumbs down?
- Enemy spotted me while sneaking behind him .... -> they got things called ears you know.
- Bad starting weapons.  -> You get like 5 AK-47 in the first 4 sectors. 1 In the very first sector which has 3 enemy's with like 20hp each
- Shooting an enemy starting the combat .... you have to 1 shot sneak kill with silent weapon to not trigger combat
- Bad graphics -> i don't even know what to say here.
- No Hit % -> The Devs told everyone about this long before release. You don't have a hit percentage in a real battle either. And if you would look carefully it is actually still there.... When you hover over the Body Part it tells you with + and - what interacts with your hit chance (Weather, obstacles, distance etc.) If there are equal + and - you aim is OK. Same for Damage btw.

Someone refunded + down-voted the game because its summer and his PC is heating the room to much when he plays JA3.
And stated it probably would be fine if it was winter ..... Just what the actual **** is wrong with you.

There are fun moments. But it turns into a grind against stupid AI sooner than later, and the excitement is gone.

Fun parts from JA2 are missing in action. For example, modding the weapons is no longer fun to me. I loved finding laser pointers, scopes, silencers, etc in JA2 and mount them to my best weapons. That feeling is gone due to the crafting system in JA3.

Then there are clunky controls and bugs. Even though the mouse cursor suggests I can interact with an object, I cannot. Then I have to pan the camera around until I get an angle where the interaction actually works.

This game went through a period of initial review bombing, that may have been unfair (it is still the company's responsibility to present a working product, no exceptions)

Now it's going through a period of wild positive reviews based on only a couple of hours of play or just being left on. 

This review is only regarding my 9 hours of play. I've played and finished the original 2 JA, the expansions and 1.13 extensively.

pros

 - the UI in my opinion is slick. It has a good look, I know people complain about it, but everyone seems to complain about a UI that has anymore than the bare minimum, and frankly, the opinion of these people are why many gamers are preferring older games. 
- the voices and behaviors of the mercs is pretty fitting, even funny at times. Fox telling me to tell her agent to ""release the nudes"" when she passes out was pretty funny for me, which I like over-the-top silly humor. 
- The gun addon features. perks for mercs, even the interface for hiring mercs is pretty slick as well. The devs figured out the community is into weaponry and made an attempt to give them something to work with that can be expanded on and modded into well.

cons:
- First the game is ""open ended"" but it isn't really. From the first time you are free to pursue objectives in the game, it is quite clear there are objectives you shouldn't do and should do. For example, if you attack the diamond mine in the north, rather than fleatowns...you are going to run into a difficult fight...and one where you are almost certain to fail the objective if you attack early. You were clearly meant to go to fleatown. In Ja2, the difficulty was pretty much the same for where you went...and you also had the benefit of loot from JA2's first difficulty spike: Dressden Defense. 
- On the same note, loot is very, very sparse and random. Your progression in early game really comes down to decent RNG. Rifles (Gewehr 98) reign superme for dealing with the games difficulty spikes after taking part of fleatown and the mine...if you run out of 7.62 NATO, you are plinking away and hoping with 9mm and .44 rounds at 10-14 a shot or risking it all (save scumming really) with headshots on brutes who can take shots from an entire squad. There's no Bobby Rays, the fleatown shop is random (and you already have to beat a tough 2 brute squad..if you have ammo for rifles, your good, if you don't, get ready for no medicine and many trips to the bar. I know this is part of the games difficulty curve, but it's not a fun risk/reward curve like JA2, it's a starving beast curve where you are praying for defenses to get you enough ammo while hiding behind your militia in some cases. Ridiculous
- The difficulty spiking. There is no obvious place you are supposed to go, but the game is literally demanding you to go a certain direction or be stuck in the hospital in high risk, low reward, long term contract wasting medical rests. It sucks, and it drains on the fun part of the game. 
- They really took cues...too many cues ...from XCOM:EU. The enemies have the perk qualities of aliens, the brutes behave like Mutons, and all the enemies have more of a ""enemy has weird abilities to watch for"" which take you out of the game. In the original, the enemies were like you, and had your strengths and weaknesses...here the enemy will have insta-counterblast, ultimate overwatch, and full sets of armor that you don't and can't have. Of course the player can overcome this, easily sometimes, but it doesn't make you feel like you are fighting an enemy mercenary force, but a force of aliens with special abilities.
- Overwatch...I had trouble with the game initially, then I learned to set ambushes and put the team on overwatch. Becuase overwatch grants you the equivalent of large amounts of AP beyond what you could ever do. And it's like that because the devs were obsessed with making the AI strong by giving them strong lanes of fire...but you have the same thing, and it looks absolutely game breaking. It's really stupid to not shoot because it's better to overwatch...but here we are. 

For me this game has enough imbalances and unfun elements to be a not recommended from me. There's a lot of potential here, and maybe it will get better, but I find the current early to mid frustrating to boring.",1689463400,1689463616,False,19,1,0.606651067733764648,0,True,False,False

The gameplay in JA3 is very good, both on a strategic and tactical level. Combat rewards a player who takes risks and observes the action; There are no enemy stat blocks to study or detailed chance to hit info, you need to get a feel for how much you need to aim, how much character stats effect their capability, how the enemies behave, how effective certain cover is, etc. Learning the game doesn't mean total control of a fight, it means knowing how to make the most of what you have and minimize attrition and it feels damn good. The unique abilities of mercs, perks, and guns give you plenty of options in the moment and overarching ways to play. Coupled with the classic play-by-feel style, theres plenty of replay value both by sheer variety and mastering the systems.

JA is more than isolated skirmishes though, the operational layer always set it apart presenting a persistent world that you need to monitor and travel through. Again, JA3 does a great job here; Deciding who to hire, where to travel, what to attack, stopping for repairs and healing or training militia, intercepting diamond convoys, distributing weapons and ammo, forming multiple squads running different missions, its fantastic. With the myriad of choices and their eventual necessity, coupled with the constant need to get more money and being on the clock of mercenary contracts expiring, I always feel my choices have real gravity and feel good when things pan out well.

This is unfortunately the part where I have to bring up a sort of dividing line however, is this JA2? No, not really. See Jagged Alliance 2's rpg elements were more of a way to make the world feel reactive and real, aside from some stats and general objectives it didn't dictate the gameplay that hard. You could easily capture an airport in a few hours and start flying in piles of weapons and establish a force to be reckoned with in a short time. JA3 leans HARD on the rpg aspect, with lots of difficult decisions, resource management, constant attrition, unique bosses and encounters, and items to find. JA3 is an excellent game, but it doesn't quite have the sandbox ""fly in as much C4 as you can carry and see if you can beat the game with it lmao"" feel of JA2. Its a feeling I miss, but it subsides when JA3 presents me with its challenges, quests, and turn based action that really manages to stand on its own two feet.

As for flaws, there aren't many but they can really hurt the game depending on what you value. The writing for mercenaries, while not hot garbage, just isn't as good as JA2. Previously fun characters with personality have been flanderized into one dimensional caricatures IE Fox is just innuendos. The fun one dimensional caricatures have been injected with mediocre personality IE Ivan Dolvich doesn't feel much like his mostly quiet cold blooded death machine incarnation of old. Its a shame too because the writers clearly have the chops, quests are really well written and mercenaries show real personality here be it by adding to the conversation or with a great joke. Its the banter you hear most of the time though that misses the mark more often than not.

The other major flaw I could see being a problem for some is the stealth. Personally I never indulged in JA2 stealth much, but hiring Shadow and playing the game like its Desperados or Commandos was a very real strategy, one I've heard is quite fun too. JA3s stealth system isn't that bad as it can be utilized in some interesting ways, maybe we're just bad because the game just came out, but without view cones or being able to initiate turn based mode before combat starts, playing a Shadow stealth run is gonna be ROUGH, if its even possible.

However, the devs have promised mod tools, which I think realistically can save most of the issues I and others have; The ability to make mercenaries could lead to porting over all the missing classics or giving returning characters their old lines back. Being able to make new maps and stories could both lead to fun fan campaigns, maybe the old games ported, or improvements to the base campaign like maybe a good shop to get weapons from. Other issues like stealth however, or the smaller enemy and militia count could forever be an issue with the engine. Only time will tell if we can solve those.

Ultimately, Jagged Alliance 3 is in my opinion an excellent game and I can't wait to play more of it. What flaws it has are made up by the gameplay just being rock solid turn based combat with a great strategic layer. Its a very different game from Jagged Alliance 2, but it still feels unmistakably Jagged Alliance. After a decade of the turn based strategy renaissance, JA3 manages to shrug off many of the conventions established by XCOM Enemy Unknown but retain the smoothness of play, and retain its own identity and establish its own unique feel to truly stand on its own as a unique and damn fine experience.

I loaded up the game. It took me a bit to figure out the right graphics settings, the right sound. The UI is complex, needs another pass through, and can be quite finicky - which will turn some who don't stick it out.  I admit after a few hours I was a bit worried. I thought it decent, but was it going to be great?

I looked up at the clock today and have played for 8 consecutive hours.  It is indeed, a great game. A game that feels fresh compared to modern TBS although its core is over 20 years old. It is rough around the edges, and needs a patch (please no timer when I'm looting med plants or boxes out of battle), but once it clicked, once I got off the main island (playing the JA equivalent of Iron Man mode!) it really clicked. 

It is brutal. I already know I messed up this playthrough and will have to try again just to get a little bit farther. But this is the type of game that as mods come out, and the game evolves, it will bring me at least a few hundred hours of great strategy.  Its not the same puzzle as XCOM is, its about making the right decisions not only in the moment, but in the economic layer too. The game just throws hardship after hardship at you. 

If you can get past the initial obtuseness and the finicky interface, there is a ton of depth here and a ton of fun. It is indeed, a merc simulator as well as a great strategy game. It exceeds the hype once you get it all down. Also - while many of the mercs are cheesy, some are absolutely hilarious. 

If you want to wait for mods I get it, but definitely buy this one!

here were some really fun moments so far:

- Sneaking into a city and setting up with two sharpshooters and an MG on one of the tallest buildings in it, and then mowing down pretty much all the enemies as they scrambled to find cover.

- MG's in general are great, I love them. They're almost useless for run-and-gun but they can set up and basically perma-overwatch a cone like it's Company of Heroes and they mow down ANYONE. They suck ammo like a convict at the crack of a gas chamber door though.

- So far it feels like bolt-actions/single action rifles are far and above the top weapon. Someone with 95+ marksmanship can no-scope headshot people AT NIGHT from medium range. Add in the perk that +5%'s your crit for every aim action you take and 4 sharpshooters with Gewehrs feels like the ultimate cheese while SMG's and assault rifles take too many rounds to kill a guy unless you're squeezing the trigger for a full-auto burst. Sidearms are mostly useless after the tutorial.

- Low weapon variety. Nothing but WW2 relics so far. MG42's, Gewehrs, MP40's, a few AK's, etc. One guy tried to sell me an M14? It's 2001 in-game. Can't I have some M16's or something?

- I miss the JA2 option to 'recruit, with equipment' that gave them more than just a pistol and three reloads when they arrive. Why would I hire a marksman with no rifle?

- The game says fuck-all about modding your kit which is crazy because it should be the first thing you do to attach a scope to your rifle or mod your iron-sights.

- If you're in a city, use R&R to heal your crew. It's cheaper in the long-run than running out of meds.

- 7.62 NATO rounds are apparently the hardest thing in the world to find. Your cup will runneth over with Warsaw Pact rounds. I support a mod that makes 7.62 ubiquitous and compatible across both east/west.

- Maybe it's been forever since I've played JA2 but was ammo really hard to find? There's no online gun store to order from like in JA2 and I feel like the game really needs it once you seize the first island. If ammo is a major concern then, again, bolt-action rifles seem to be the way to go rather than wasting your time with SMG's and assault rifles.

- Bizarrely, enemies seem to have no internal logic for ammo count as they will full-auto you all day. I once watched a guy unload three times and almost yelled at my screen ""WHEN IS HE GONNA STOP & RELOAD?!"" You will not scavenge more than 12 rounds off an entire battle though.

- It's cheaper to just train militia to be a roadblock for the inevitable enemy squad counterattacks against mines/cities than it is to risk your guys asses, since militia have the magic infinite ammo glitch too.

Pros:
- Good voice acting
- Humor and interaction between mercs
- Better graphics than JA2/JA1, naturally.

Cons:
- Where to start? The tactical elements are extremely dumbed down
- The graphics just .. is messy. The environment doesn´t feel true, it feels like a Lego game setting
- Inventory and customization is extremely dumbed down and simplified
- The strategy layer when not in combat is just unengaging and boring
- The tactical gameplay is just ... lacking of everything

I was surprised with how close to JA2 the game feels, however: the merc system, the world map and the character system, aside from the additions like perks, feel like 1:1 copies and im glad they didn't try to reinvent the wheel on this one.
I have never played XCOM or similar games, so I can't speak exactly to how it's holding up in terms of tactics, but in 10 hours of coop on the hardest difficulty we breezed through it just fine, until we had to reload a particular fight 5 times to beat it with the right strategy.

Here was a sentence about game locking PC - I would not expect that to be the case, but downclocking my CPU by one notch in single and two cores workload fixed that. Since I've got a lot of other 1/2 core workloads that proved to be stable I would never expect JA3 to have issues with that.

Game looks GORGEOUS, no denial, I was shocked, but the game basically looks like a sharper Crysis 1 with way better textures. Basic combat looks confusing at first, but it takes a short time to understand it to a comprehensive level, but extra abilities will take way more time. Cheeky mercs as supposed, Steroid rocks! Music is what really surprised me as well - there's tons of familiar tunes from JA2, notes can be recognized in the laptop music and when idling on the map. Love it, though music itself sound a bit too much modern and steers away from atmosphere, JA2 music, while kinda rough, was really in-tune with game atmosphere and was unique on its own. In JA3 it's mostly ""Oh hey, there's music. Wait, that fragment sounds familiar!"". City music with vocals fit the region very well though.

Here was a text about a quick save, but there is one, under F5 with F9 as a quickload. I've no idea how did that slip from my eyes, I've checked hotkeys :v.

Then the performance - 1080p ultra taxes 3080 Ti to 270W and do 90FPS, 4k eats whole 380W and produces 60FPS with DLSS2 and 77% scaling. No CPU usage with 12700k. Memory wise, it seem to hit RAM hard for some reason with IO operations, really hard.

A serious cons is how unintuitive is the tactical map and how every in-game window is hidden behind shortcuts. To assign a job, you need to press the teeny tiny icon by mercs name (and the operations button, which I've only noticed after 4 hours of gameplay, should of been called assign job in my opinion), so you may as well never do that, as that's very hidden, you might as well never know it's even possible in the first place. While on the map, to access inventory, go to the map, do literally anything you need to know shortcuts, UI hiding was taken way too far, devs should add at least SOME icons on the UI, even if auto-hiding when not hovering your mouse on. After two hours of gameplay I still don't know how to interpret the range bar when targetting an enemy.

So far, after 14h or so of gameplay (started the game over 2 times, because of things).
Anyway. This is THE Jagged Alliance successor we were looking for. Took a long time to get it right, but this is an awesome game.

Most of the fan favorite mercs are there (looking at Ivan and Fox) and they've been made even more unique in the character perk they have.
For the sake of an example, Fidel can throw 2 grenades at once, Ivan gets 3 AP (action points) after a kill and so forth.

So now even the worse mercs have a place in a team, because of those said perks, like Barry is a great example. Not a good merc, but a really good, and most of all CHEAP explosives expert, who happens to get 2 shaped charge grenades every 168h, free of charge and he can rack up kills left and right with a correct use of grenades.
So that's a great idea from the devs imo.

About the gameplay. It's just what i and every Jagged Alliance and Jagged Alliance 2 fan wanted. Turn based combat, real time moving, until the enemy spots you. Simple and works like a charm.
Enemies are fair in difficulty, although they can be stupid af, if you get out of line of sight and hide yourself (stealth basically), so they're pretty lost on where to look and they really won't look for you, atleast i haven't seen them do that.

Only real gripe with the game is the fact that your mines will run out of diamonds, which are essential in keeping your squad running, so there's a bit of a feeling that you might get screwed over by that eventually, if you take your time for too long.
Good thing is that the enemy doesn't raid your stuff all the time, like in the non successor JA games, which was a real pain in the... Had 2 raids so far in total, with around 30 sectors cleared.

All in all, after 14 hours, it's an awesome game and well worth the pricetag if you're a fan of the series OR just a fan of tactical turn based games.",1689454624,1689454624,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's been mentioned countless times about the Chance To Hit being removed which is fine but you still have to give the player some kind of information. Phoenix Point removed CTH and did it masterfully, this just feels like a bizarre implementation and while the goal was probably to create some fluidity all it really achieves is making the save-scumming problem of turn based games worse.
Consider too that the devs already uploaded a mod to add CTH back in but ""the game isn't balanced around it"", so the game is balanced around a mechanic that doesn't work.

Lack of information is prevalent through all that I have played. I can disarm certain mines in a minefield but others fail and explode inexplicably. 

There are a lot of problems especially the lack of the armaments vendor, but the inability to strategise in a strategy game is the killer.

Let me start off with the negatives, to just get it out of the way.

First and Foremost, this is not an exact replica of (arguably the best turn based tactical game ever made) JA2 which will be disappointing to some. There are a few things that I personally disliked when comparing the two titles, mainly how much smaller maps are in JA3 and the increased emphasis on resource management. Maps feel tighter and more fleshed out, but there was a certain charm to larger battles in JA2 that I feel is missing here. Moving on, I can understand not including Bobby Ray's shop even if it was one of my favorite features of JA2, but in the 12 hours I've played so far I have not been able to field even a single machine gun because there is never enough ammo to feed it. Furthermore, I have yet to find enough medical supplies to make healing my own troops a viable option. These aren't a big deal, but I do wish there were more options for purchasing certain resources beyond the limited markets, especially ammunition.

Another gripe I have with this title is the UI. I miss having distinct strategy and computer menus to better organize everything. Everything just kind of feels thrown at you all at once, and it can be a struggle to organize everything you're trying to do. That being said, the overall presentation is fantastic and it's clear a lot of work was put into making the map and menus look top notch.

The actual gameplay is an absolute joy to play and feels faithful to JA2 while adapting to modern times. It still feels like I'm in a gunfight more so than anything, and I have personally chosen to forego the modification to display hit chance because it never really matters in the grand scheme of things. You take your team and put them in the best position to fight, and it's incredibly rewarding when your mix of stealth, positioning, and patience pays off with an overwhelming victory over a superior force that would stomp you in a face to face confrontation.

I'd like to take a moment to inform new players that this game is incredibly difficult, and that ironman mode alongside higher difficulties is absolutely not how you should play this your first time around. Quicksave is your friend, and the beginning portion of the game when you only have access to pistols and SMGs is especially difficult, so don't be disheartened if it doesn't seem fair or fun your first hour or two. It gets better when your team is fully kitted out, I promise lol. Be aware however, that you might make some critical strategic mistakes (such as picking a bad team, running out of cash, letting too many people die, etc) your first time around and that this game takes a long time to learn and master.

It's obvious that some of the new changes are inspired by XCOM but I do not personally believe this is a bad thing. A cover system was originally in JA2 but you never really knew how well you were covered and this could cause problems so I like the change. When combat kicks off it's only natural that enemies should run for cover and get behind something and this along side all enemies moving at once at the start of their turn feels organic and fluid which I think is cool. Like, you kick combat off by putting a bullet through the strongest enemy's head from a distance and everyone scatters. Every turn they close in on you as a team all at the same time, and you can really feel the tension as they flank and surround you, often far outnumbering your forces. I know it's a little thing, but I believe it adds a lot of quality to the game all things considered.

The story is just okay and some of the characters are over the top (especially on tutorial island) but the actual strategic gameplay is wonderful and feels improved when compared to JA2. I love the diamond shipments that move across the map and enemy outposts that need to be weakened externally before being battled head on. Furthermore, some of the quests have been a blast (rescuing Biff has been my favorite so far, what a wild battle!) and I love how fleshed out the world is. You'll show up to sectors sometimes thinking you'll have just a regular battle and then things can get crazy which I enjoy quite a bit. 

Some people may take offense to some of the characters and what they say (""you shoot pretty good... for a girl"") but this stays faithful to how characters were portrayed in JA2 which were often over the top action movie stereotypes that weren't exactly PC. The dialog isn't great but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviewers have stated. Overall I think it adds to the unique charm of the game but it isn't exactly amazing either.

Performance isn't great on my 4K setup, but I have yet to encounter any actual bugs so far which is a good sign. While I should be able to play this on ultra settings, I've had to settle for medium settings which still looks good so I'm not too upset. I believe that over the following weeks and months that the developers will only continue to improve everything, but so far it's definitely in good shape technically. 

With steam workshop being already available and fantastic core gameplay as a base, this a title I could see myself getting hundreds, if not thousands of hours into over the years. Although there is way more I could say, I am incredibly excited to see how much this game improves over the years and I believe it is a worthy successor to the legendary Jagged Alliance 2. 

If you like XCOM or similar games you'll probably like this a lot too. Give it a go, there's a good chance you'll like it.

Gameplay is built well. Tactical battles, weapon upgrades, operations, skill and perk systems - all these engaging and not boring. There is no tutorial, old-school style.

Mercs are roleplaying, commenting on your actions, and contributing their 50 Grand Chien cents to dialogs. Loving each merc's character I picked.

The gameplay mechanics are solid and I'm rarely frustrated wondering why I can't hit something
The mercs have great comments and characteristics. I can't wait to play some of the other ones. They all have strengths and weaknesses and forming great squads is so important and fun to figure out. For example, I forgot to put someone with explosive experience in my group and I've had a few things blow up in my face.
The music is awesome. I rarely think about music but it flows well with the action, a lot like a movie.
The strategic gameplay is really fun. Do you train those troops to defend the town, costing you time and money, or do you go attack? So many great decisions to make.
Lack of bugs. I haven't found any yet and I've played for 6 hours.

Things I didn't love:

Game feels %90 there, but needs some fixing; especially in the balancing of difficulty. If you're fan of the franchise and the price point is at or below $30 USD, then I'd say it's worth it. 6/10

After playing in a marathon session on release day I found many things which I really liked and some that I found unwanted in a game like this. It's obvious that the devs have tried to keep pretty close to spirit of the original JA franchise. Probably the biggest one you'll notice first is that the voice lines/acting are on par with previous titles; general silliness, innuendo, etc. You can tell that for the satellite UI they made an effort to make it look and feel like it did in JA2. In short, the essence of the game feels like a Jagged Alliance title.

There's also a decent list of things I thought were out of place for this title. Yes, the game does tell you that it's supposed to be difficult, but that's a little understated. On its face, a 'difficult' game isn't itself bad, but in previous JA titles difficulty had a huge number of modifiers which allowed the user to decide how difficult it was. In the original you could opt to give yourself extra AP, chose the number of enemies, more money, etc. JA2 simplified this, but still gave plenty of options to augment the game's difficulty. JA3 only offer is 'forgiving mode'.

In JA3, after making it off the 'tutorial island' one of my first fights was against a group of veteran hostiles, one of which was armed with a mortar. One thing I found out very quickly was that this mortarman is able to setup and fire in the same turn. RIP two mercs instantly.

With the first two games and their add-ons, in default difficulty, they were at least fair; with the starting cash, you can only really hire cheap mercs with cheap weapons, and the opposition reflects that. JA3 gives you rifles very early on and a merc with 50-60 marksmanship is equally as bad with a rifle as it is with a pistol, just at longer ranges. However, the AI also gets rifles just as quickly and their accuracy isn't nearly as bad and eff you if you think that sheet metal shack is anything other than concealment. I've also noticed that enemies behind any amount of cover, even if I'm attacking from a different angle, still get the benefits of that cover and in some cases are only allowed to receive grazing shots, even if I'm on the same side of said cover, aka shooting at their open backside.

This applies with the trained militias vs hostile groups as well. I got into a fight with militia in the same sector and they're largely useless. I initially thought it was going to be helpful when I saw one of the militia go around to the back door of a building where a hostile was located only to watch it shoot through a doorway at an enemy twice as far away while there was enemy crouching right in front of them(I'm assuming this is because they were counted as being behind cover even though there was unobstructed LOS between them.) In simulated fights the militia seems to do better, but not by much. Travel takes a huge amount of time, if you don't have access to a port then eff your hold on the starting island as they'll quickly wear down your militia very quickly with multiple attacks. This, along with the issues with direct combat, give the game an crushingly difficult feel.

The other things which irks me is interacting with objects and selling found valuables. Some objects which are trapped, have a specific skill check, or have multiple ways to open(lockpick vs crowbar), don't have a context menu like in JA2, where I can specify how I want to interact with it or make sure I choose the right merc for the job. When you find diamonds, along with other valuables, you can sell them immediately regardless of where you are. In everything else they're trying to be as realistic as possible, but somehow I can get immediate cash for diamonds while I'm in the middle of nowhere. Not really a complaint, it just felt out of place.

One big QOL improvement I think they should've borrowed from JA2 was the sector inventory screen. In JA2, after a fight, I just need one merc to go around and open containers/see loot dropped by dead hostiles and then I can go to the sector inventory screen and I look at what's available.

My closing thoughts on this are regarding mod support. I see all too frequently studios that add modding support as a way to have the community do for free what they should've done in the first place and I hope this isn't the case for JA3.",1689443958,1689443958,False,4,0,0.519044041633605957,0,True,False,False

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Jagged Alliance 3, developed by Haemimont Games, released a long-awaited sequel to the beloved Jagged Alliance series, sadly it falls short of capturing the essence and excitement of its predecessors. With its lackluster gameplay, technical issues, and missed opportunities, Jagged Alliance 3 fails to live up to the legacy of the franchise, leaving fans feeling disappointed and unsatisfied.

[h1]Tedious Gameplay and Lack of Strategy[/h1]
One of the most significant disappointments in Jagged Alliance 3 is its lackluster gameplay. The strategic depth and tactical decision-making that were hallmarks of the series have been watered down or overshadowed by more generic mechanics. The game fails to offer engaging and thought-provoking challenges, instead opting for repetitive and uninspired encounters that lack the complexity and strategic depth that fans of the franchise have come to expect.

[h1]Underwhelming Character Development and Progression[/h1]
Character development and progression have always been key elements of the Jagged Alliance series, but in Jagged Alliance 3, they feel lacking and uninspired. The roster of mercenaries lacks depth and distinct personalities, making it challenging to form meaningful connections with the characters. The progression system also fails to provide a sense of growth and customization, leaving players feeling disconnected from their team and unmotivated to invest in their development.

[h1]Technical Issues and Lack of Polish[/h1]
Jagged Alliance 3 suffers from a myriad of technical issues that significantly impact the gameplay experience. From frequent crashes and game-breaking bugs to poor optimization and long loading times, the game feels unfinished and lacking in polish. These technical shortcomings disrupt immersion, frustrate players, and tarnish the overall enjoyment of the game. Even looting is a struggle because some Items are not clickable or are difficult to spot (even with the highlight object feature)

[h1]Dull Visual Design and Audio Presentation[/h1]
Visually, Jagged Alliance 3 fails to impress. The environments lack detail and fail to create an immersive atmosphere that draws players into the game world. Character models lack personality and animation fluidity, resulting in a lackluster visual experience. The audio design is equally disappointing, with forgettable sound effects and a lack of memorable music or voice acting. The overall presentation feels uninspired and fails to engage players on an audiovisual level.

[h1]Missed Opportunities and Lack of Innovation[/h1]
Jagged Alliance 3 fails to bring any notable innovations or fresh ideas to the table. It relies heavily on outdated mechanics and fails to capitalize on the potential for new and exciting gameplay elements. The game lacks innovation and feels like a missed opportunity to revitalize the franchise with engaging features and modern design.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Jagged Alliance 3 disappoints on multiple fronts, failing to capture the essence and excitement of its beloved predecessors. With its lackluster gameplay, technical issues, uninspired visual and audio design, and missed opportunities for innovation, the game fails to live up to the legacy of the franchise. Fans of the series will be left feeling unsatisfied and longing for the strategic depth, engaging characters, and immersive gameplay that defined the previous Jagged Alliance games. Jagged Alliance 3 ultimately falls short of the expectations set by its predecessors and fails to deliver an experience worthy of the franchise's reputation.

-set antialiasing to DLSS 2 or FSR if your graphics card suppots those - big difference!

as it is Pretty underwhelming.


Money situation is already piss-poor and then after conquering them mines run dry in not even a month?

Yeah right, totally realistic.

And a 8000 dollar per day dropping for diamond mines is just laughable.

Everything in this game is choking down players:

Poor to none loot or plunder, broken money earnings that are connected to chasing down some diamond couriers while your mines run dry in no time, HP Sponge Bob mobs that grow worse the farther you progress, 3-4 odds growing worse and worse, no way to gear how I like even with money as the weapons are also choked as getting them, ammunition choked down with random drops in laughable amounts that cannot sustain a even 5 person team and on and on.

At the moment it is just a sadism tour.

It exists on a spectrum between the classics and the Expeditions series (avoiding comparisons to the new Xcoms because even with similarities the feel is very different. 

Some classical grognard features have been simplified to make room for meaningful decisions and more abstracted resource management and logistics. For example: fewer items, shared squad ammo inventory, sell/breakdown items anywhere/anytime, etc.  This makes for fun gaming, but will irritate the purists who played ""Sector Inventory Manager 2 v1.13"" ad nauseum. 

I enjoy these abstractions because the previous games' ability to collect and sort bananas and loose rounds and set schedules like a Wendy's manager didn't add much for me. What remains is the operational urgency to keep funds flowing, some meaningful management and NPC decisions, and the streaky highs and lows of the tactical layer.

Balanced/gamey weapon stats/mods similarly will irritate the gun nuts who want to race to emulate their fave airsoft meta loadout. However these stats, mixed with a nice balance of perks, unlock far more tactical options than both XCOM's style of chess and JA2 angle/roof sniping gave me. I do miss the JABiA ability to coordinate attacks--this game tends more towards cycling abilities than realistic fire and maneuver. 

The visual design keeps you engaged with your mercs and the other random NPCs. The graphics are smooth, and I haven't seen a bug yet. Music goes hard but I turn down most ambient sounds. 

And finally, coop--enjoy the newest version of ""lose your friends simulator"" as your girlfriend fails to cover your flank and allows your suicidal Igor rush to fail again... Ivan knows the importance of family, he wouldn't have let this happen. Coop QOL isn't perfect but is very cleverly designed. You can act simulataneously, see their overwatch zones, pass items to nearby coop teammates, see their preferred dialogue choices, hotjoin, and even see who they are aiming at. Minor tweaks will make it the best tactical coop out there if it isn't already. 

Current issues: Xcom/Expeditions-type enemy activation really sucks,probably because they all move together, forcing suspension of belief and preveng opportunities to take down whole squads of enemies. You can still stealth your way into some short kill chains, but there are few easy-win buttons without abusing mechanics.

Financial analysis is hard with the tools given. If you're the type to run at a $10 balance to get an early elite Merc you'll need a calculator. 

Funnillly, my biggest gripe besides Livewire missing every shot is that I can never tell when the loading screen is done. My coop partner and I would sit for several minutes distracted by other technology, not realizing we could have clicked start. Needs a bigger transition to signal loading complete. 

Steamdeck controls work well enough with good defaults and some user configs appearing.

Great gameplay, similar to the gameplay we know from the originals + an interesting perk system, streamlining and superior UI. 

Performance is OK with the use of DSR/FSR. Hope it gets improved with coming updates.

Music is underwhelming and annoying at times, i turned it off and play my own music in the background, playing the JA2 OST in the background elevates the nostalgia to a whole new level. 

Story and character interactions are quite funny and interesting so far, i think they hit the JA mood perfectly!

Dont underestimate the difficulty! i started on ""commando"" and i almost ran out of money before i was able to leave the starter island. had to free a mining sector without healing or repairing beforehand and still running a deficit. this is going to be interesting...

of course things gonna be different! JA2 was one of my fav games when i was young, so i was nervous that they wont hit the feeling what makes Jagged Alliance well... Jagged Alliance. But they did!

Almost all changes i noticed so far are for the better. havent seen any dumbing down or anything like that.

-Map sectors are very linear and small. Basically, sectors are one or two small buildings and a few paths to get to them. only this.

-The inventory is done unrealistically, it gives you the feel of a cartoon game instead of a tactical strategy. (I want to see that squad chest!)

- Stealth is a joke. Throwing knives from a distance of 2 grids is mostly a miss, or it only took 20-22 dmg, even with skills at 85 or higher. This also applies to weapons. The combat is insanely rushed and unrealistically done. Enemies can run the entire map and shoot, both in the same turn, and have 360` cone vision.

devs should simply set the game's default to FXAA to avoid unnecessary disappointment or reviews by casuals.

despite not caring about story in games at all the snippets and story so far are actually fun, entertaining and enjoyable. gameplay is obviously more modernized and streamlined compared to JA1 and JA2 but also very enjoyable so far.

Its good, as a massive JA2 fan I like the new installment of JA3.
Theres some good features in this that JA2 didn't have like overwatch and stuff.
Sadly I do have to say I feel like it doesnt hit quite the same as JA2.
The UI and laptop and stuff doesnt feel as good and it seems like theres more 'training' wheels on in JA3.
The mercs are eh and they shouldve been modelled on the first one. Grizzly was my boy, this Grizzly is just cannon fodder to me now.

Now dont get me wrong its a good game but I think ill go back and start playing JA2 when I get bored.
I really like the merc items and stuff and the more realistic look of JA2, where as it feels sorta cartoony in JA3.

I get they didn't just want to remake JA2 but it just doesn't feel the same, like aiming for example. 
The immersion gets destroyed when a massive wheel of body part options comes up, they had a system before it worked great why change it. 

The merc player choice is basic and no one really relatable, you cant choose the voice either.

You don't even need a code to make your own merc. XEP624 will be burnt into my brain for life.

Ill keep playing but honestly just buy JA2. Its amazing in comparision, yea a lil dated but its great.

I was lost at first because it feels so different from JA2, but then I told myself this is not JA2 Remastered. I'm just going to touch on certain areas that I felt weren't addressed by other users.

Weapon abilities: So far I think they do an interesting thing with the weapon abilities. People then to not care about pistol-waving enemies thinking they aren't going to hit anything, but the abilities it has gives the AI the chance to rush your position for a flank shot. The AI have numbers on their side so combat needs to be really careful.

Map Size: Basically, JA2 has twice the number of AP for each character, and thus the size of the map is twice as big. To be fair, this reduction of AP and map size really does larger weapons dirty. 

Militia & Enemy: Because of the reduction in map size, my dream of seeing a 20 vs 26 gun fight between militia and the enemy is gone >_< But it does feel odd that the militia is kitted out better than mercs. I believe its to counteract the fact that the enemy already starts with assault rifle right at the beginning while your men are running around with pistols and SMG.

Direction facing: I get why they didn't implement this, because there's no longer interrupt in the sense of JA2, and you don't really use extra AP when shooting at a different angle. Speaking of interrupt...

Overwatch/Interrupt Vs normal shots: Some argue it is better to just overwatch now because you can fire off more shots compared to normal shooting, I would say this is situational. Overwatch triggers during movement, and attack. So if an enemy moves before they shoot, you get 2 shots off, but if they just shoot, you only get 1 shot off. Also, overwatch sometimes places your mercs outside cover, for example if they're hiding behind a door but you asked them to overwatch an area, they will step out from cover and camp at the doorway. This is actually dangerous for your merc. I rather take shots and remain behind the wall in this case.

Stealth: People complain that stealth doesn't work, but it took me 10 hours to master stealth in this game, stealth attacks, but not stealth melee. Because enemies walk around and turn around too often for a melee sneak to work. With stealth attacks, your rifle (with suppressor) is deadly versus enemies who are alone, so to avoid getting overwhelmed, sneak around to find lone targets first before engaging the bulk of the enemy. 

All in all, if they slightly enlarge the map to make heavier weapons work, I think the game will be better. Of course, if they could add more militia and enemies it will be much better!

-did decent job with mercs,
-its turn based... unlike previous jagged attempts.
-graphics work but so did Ja2's at the time
-it seems it will be moddable

cons (that can be fixed hopefully)
-inventory is way too basic. group inventory and no molle system, not very jagged alliance style.
-weapon list is bargain basement. the tons of guns feature in ja2 made it pimp. considering the graphics this probably will be stuck like this. but can hope.

I don't know what game IGN's reviewer played, but almost every single action is basically just flipping a coin. You have *zero* information about what your squad may or may not be able to do - you just have to guess. There is nothing to tell you if that shot you took was because your mercenary has good aim and a clear line of sight, or if you completely fluked a 5% chance to hit. I realized almost immidiately that there's no planning anything - you just have to *try*, and then save-scum through the whole thing. 

Is 81 a high marksman skill? Who knows? There's nothing to really indicate what it does. Is 80 a good dexterity for sneaking up on people? No way to tell, you just have to risk getting your mercenary killed to find out. I found the ""impossible"" shots, with no line of sight right across the map, to be far more reliable than getting up right next to somebody, spending 7 AP points on aiming a gun right down their throats, and apparently being unable to hit them. The difference between *those* two shots were usually about 9-11 points in marksmanship. 

The targeting in this is a complete mess. As others have pointed out, the *enemies* can obviously calculate the percentages that *you* can't. Machine gun thugs with hit you with every bullet through trees and rocks and cover, while your snipers can't hit a target out in the open 10 feet away, with a 91 marksman skill. Don't even attempt fighting at night - it's a complete waste of bullets. The *only* weapon that can be relied on to hit anything is grenades, even with a 5 explosives skill. 

I have played a lot of these types of games, and finding the right balance between overwhelming odds, and planning *against* them is key. You should feel like the underdog, who can take on a much stronger enemy by outmaneuvering them, and in this, I feel like I'm sitting with my back to the screen, pressing a ""works/doesn't work"" button until the battle is resolved. 

It's a shame too, because I for one quite enjoyed the idea of taking a group of weirdos on a holiday gone horribly wrong. Unfortunately, it *did* go horribly wrong. 

Also, what on EARTH possesed them to think people wouldn't want to make at least one Merc for themselves? How do you make a game like this, and think character customization shouldn't be a part of it? 

Besides that, the interface is janky as hell. More than once, I had mercenaries run right up next to an opponent, instead of entering the shooting menu. I tried *very* hard to enter a region, but the satelite menu doesn't have an ""engage"" option, or ""start"" button. You have to *enter* the region, and then *close* the satelite menu to start the engagement. 

Too much unpolished, thoughtless nonsense to make for a good game.",1689362759,1689413446,False,48,2,0.519161105155944824,5,True,False,False

Every merc has a really distinctive unique perk that helps shape their role and then you pick more over time.

In my short time playing JA3 I was picking out things I didn't like, not sitting there thinking ""wow cool"".

Some of my gripes follow below.

The targeting of enemies and shooting the rounds was perfect in JA2, simple right clicks while physically aiming at the body part with your cursor gave you all the info you needed in a tidy little package. Now you click your enemy and get an extensive UI showing very little important information, with massive buttons you can press for each body part.

Movement and cover is basically a rip from any modern tactical game of this calibre, (looking at you poop modern xcom games), on several occasions I moved my mercs to a location expecting them to be in cover only to find the cover was actually one tile over. Realised eventually i needed to spin the camera round before moving so I could see if the cover shield was visible or not.

There is no minimap, and no sector overview. At the start of the round you need to scout the map with your camera so you actually know what the map is like.

The perks and abilities of the mercs make it seem more like some kind of RPG, balancing dice rolls and using special abilities to gain an advantage like ""distracting shot"" that removes x and y from the opponent but adds Z. Some more examples of things I really don't think fit into this game... 

Inevitable Strike (Kalyna) – Special ranged attack that bypasses enemy armour.
Vashe Zdorovye! (Igor) – Special ability that grants 25 Grit (25 grit? wtf are you doing?), a melee damage bonus, at the cost of ranged accuracy.
Top Spotter (Raven) – Setting up Overwatch applies Marked to all targets within, guaranteeing a critical next time they’re hit.

These are just a few examples.

What game are we playing here?

Inventory management... Managing mercs, who wouldn't want to see them in that cool new body armor you found? Oh crap look at this cool chest rig with a holster for a pistol, a sheath for your knife, magazine  pouches perhaps? Nah forget all of that! 

Armor, pants and helmet. They have damage reduction. You can't see them when you equip them. Your mercs will always look the same. That's it, that's the actual depth of your clothing management. Poop.

Guns... I looked into the guns in the dev diaries or whatever they called em, and again it just looks like rpg mechanics slapped all over it from what I could tell.

I am a big fan of Xenonauts, imo thats a true successor to the golden tactical strategies we had back in the day (yeah i'm old). One of the most enjoyable factors of the late game was how cool all your guys looked in there fancy armor with cool ass helmets and... stuff.

Bottom line is, the Xenonauts 2 Early access comes out in 3 days as I am writing this review. I would bet good money that game will be exceptional and everything I am currently looking for in a squad based, isometric strategy game.

Thanks to this game my steam wallet will be well prepared for its release.

Thanks for reading.

+Runs just fine on my garbage PC
+Solid tactical battles with meaningful choices about items, cover, stealth, climbing, etc
+Good value from all secondary skills. You will get hurt, there will be a lot of mines, and mechanical is as good as ever
+Engaging management/strategic choices. Low funds will push you to scout less, repair less, rest less, take risks. Travel times long enough to be a concern too, and tired mercs will struggle. Far stronger sense of tension on management layer than any previous JA
+Weather and environments change the battle. Night ops is not as repetitive and strong a strategy. If you take cover behind something made of wood, it will get shredded by burst fire (unless it's a tree)
+Still has the soul of JA games, lots of good dialogue and silliness from your team.
+Only new merc I used so far is Livewire. Fantastic voice actor, very useful character too
+Possible to use stealth and ambush tactics for entire map, even with a lot of movement
+Melee a much more valuable option too. Dr Q is a beast
+Weapon types feel more distinct. Run and gun with SMGs, snipe from shadows and rooftops with a rifle, set up and mow down crowds with machine guns
+Loot/weapon progression also improved. Find assault rifles and machine guns in the first few hours. Craft scopes and other accessories fairly early too. Mercs can play to their strengths much sooner, but items still aren't overpowered in context

-Some UI challenges. Ambushing enemies takes a little learning, since they keep moving even as you begin to give the command to attack.
-Initially had sound issues, but they went away on their own.
-Some maps are very small, though to be fair there are different size enemy groups as well. Perhaps the intent is for some fights to be fast and simple

-Immersive world with GREAT town music, interesting characters with real motivations, and neat NPC interactions- for example, I cleared a fort near a town and train militia there. Now I hear townspeople gossiping about maybe volunteering at the fort. Really makes you feel like you're making an impact on the world.
-Difficult combat that demands smart deployment and tactical decisions

After 4 hours on, I can say, JA3 is a good successor and I hope that its sequel and modding will get to fill the huge shoes of JA2.
AI is good and battles are challenging. The terrain and its impact on shooting (providing cover or advantage) is wonderful. 
The RPG elements seems fine and even better then JA2.
On the other hand, the sectors are tiny, and I can’t see a reason to use a mortar.  while in JA2 your maximum mortar range will be a third of the sector.
I can't get used to the new voices, they are not even close to the great voice actors of JA2 (whatever Igor accent is, it can’t be called as a Russian accent, sorry). This is part of the charm that I’m missing and after 24+ years of JA, you could have done better.
The sectors are tiny. Yes, it’s not JA2 1.13 with 80 enemies rushing on you in a large sector but calling a tiny map with 4 houses a village is quite a disappointment.
JA2 is a very complex game that had a lot of time and thought invested in it. JA3 is not there yet, and I hope that the jump to JA4 will be just like from JA1 to JA2.
Still I would recommend playing the game.

Now 2023/07/14 Jagged Alliance 3 is out..  So , i hesitated and waited for reviews soar , held my refund trigger ready and nearly did it.
Fuck those monkey fags who review bombed after just playing couple hours...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you played modern Xcom games? You did well shit hello ! Yes it's very similar too xcom so, ui and flow of the fight wont really be that new.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay:  *good old fashioned  turn base, % hit chance Role-playing-game*
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Visuals: They alright. ( Very dumb decision on not allowing visual representation of ARMOR AND HELMETS being worn by mercenaries.)You pretty much get standard wacky looking civies or commandos i presume DLCS,mods might change that in future.
--------------------------------
Music in game: It is fine , yet i tend fire up my own music anyway.
--------------------------------------
Levels/MAP design: Devs cheesed on this part.
-----------------------------------------------
Will this become legendary game as JA2 with 1.13 ? Honestly i doubt.
---------------------------
Is it worth 44.99? Nah go get it cheaper from instant gaming or whatever place you use.
---------------------------------
is it worth playing?  Yes!

Simply put it this way. Most games come out in early access ,looter shooter,battleroyal trash and simply this being complete nostalgic throw back earns the WORTH A PLAY ..

------------------------------------------------------------------

P.s DISCORD server of this game is gay .. Been on it asked devs opinion on design decision and some terminally online monkeys youtubers got mad ...

All mercs (almost) from previous game are there - steroid, blood, shadow, ice - all my favourite  and idk if its scripted or there is even dynamics within party (igor is trying to pick up fox in my gameplay).

But they did a pretty good job IMO. We finally got something that's like JA2 but with todays graphics... Some minor changes have been done, but the core is JA2 combat... 

Some Changes I noticed: Inventory slots, now every merc has slots based on strengh and thats it... Also theres a shared slot system to each squad with ammo and stuff everyone uses...

Points combat system is the same but different... its more straight forward than JA2... its like JA2 is ""C"" and this is ""C++""... likeee.... in JA2 u have 70-100 points of action... in this one u have 9-16 but it works well enough...

History and characters in the world (that I encountered so far) are rich... also I like these bosses and the choices that come with them in some locations....

One thing that I miss is buying stuff online... I think this is gone... also I wasnt able to sell anything only scrap it...

ABOUT THE SCRAP THING:
Now the attachments of the guns requires these scrap and a merc with high mechanical to craft them on that weapon...
I wasnt able to unmount an attachment and put it in another gun... and I think it's not possible....
This is a MAJOR change from JA2 and tbh I did not like it at all.... I preffer the old attachment system...I hope some mods can do that in the future...

Speaking about mods:
I think mods have great potential to overhaul and shape the game to whatever we want... so thats a blessing...
everyone will get to play JA3 the way they want with mods in the future...


Overall... I am finally happy with this sequel..

Here are some of my pointers on this for fans of the series considering to buy JA3.

+ Great immersion and attention to detail.
+ Decent AI. Victories feel well earned. Expect a good challenge even on normal difficulty.
+ Feels like the true sequel to Jagged Alliance unlike the crappy spinoffs of the past decade.

- Less mercs compared to JA2 but that's expected and with time (DLCs/Mods) that'll improve.
- FPS slightly mushy at times during explosions in complex environments (but still very playable)
- No UI scaling option. (Biggest issue imho with this text-heavy game currently. Hope this gets patched soon.)

POSITIVES
- The laptop. It's here, and it's awesome. Looks like 2001, and that's not far off from the 1999 laptop we all know and love from JA2. It has its own new style, while still looking old and pushing that nostalgia button for me. Very cool.
- Returning mercs. Some of my favourites are here. Reaper, Shadow and Ivan are all represented, as are some of the others we all remember from 1999 (well, the old people anyway, myself included). 
- The music. The music has a very punchy, cinematic feel and closely resembles that of JA2, while still feeling original. Great work here. 

However, this game is not all smiles and sunshine, and unfortunately, there are many, MANY negatives that outweigh the fantastic positives above, and do no justice to the game many of us still play today. I know I might just be holding on to the past here, but bear with me, and read on. 

NEGATIVES
- The graphical style does NOT fit this IP. JA is meant to be serious, mature, bloody, violent, grotesque and visceral. The visuals here do not portray this motif for me. The colours are bright, vivid and saturated - and that is NOT the kind of environment the game this one aspires to be has in store for players. The blood is bright red, almost pinkish, the mercs look like cartoon characters, and the weapon models look low res and muted. I don't understand the need to make this game look like a cartoon. And I hope it isn't to appeal to as many hardware specs as possible, because frankly many other games run extremely well optimized while still looking incredible (Doom Eternal is a great example of this.)

- The interactions are bland, weak and uninspired. Especially the gun play. It doesn't FEEL like it did in JA2 when someone gets shot. This should be accurately and realistically represented. Headshots from high powered firearms don't kill instantly? We have downed states now? Wtf is this? These are FIREARMS spewing hot lead into the bones, muscle and sinew of human beings, oversized fleshbags that would otherwise be torn to pieces by bullets, shrapnel and the like. Meanwhile buddy can take a shot in the head and shrug it off like it's a bad headache? Come on. Remember the decapitations and exploding heads we had in JA2 when a guy took a .338 Lapua Magnum to the face? Where the hell is that?

- Animations are lackluster. In line with the above, I feel that the animations are very lackluster, weak and don't properly reflect the impact of various scenes, such as being shot, for example, or being blown back by an explosion. The animations, instead of feeling fluid, heavy, and accurate are instead floaty, and look like a bad action movie. The forces on the human body are not accurately represented, and that's unfortunate, because they are in JA2.

- The TBS strategy lair is copy and paste. This is NOT XCOM! I hate this. Companies making games with the XCOM movement, combat and cover model, because it was good in XCOM. It's NOT good here. This game doesn't need that. If you did what we had in JA2, that would have been enough and probably less work.

- Visual fidelity. The visual fidelity is laughable for a 2023 game. And hey, I know visuals aren't everything - we sure as hell didn't have a great visual fidelity in JA2, but it was still a great game. Zooming in on mercs and the environment was instrumental in revealing just how low poly everything is. Low quality textures and many aspects of the environment copy and pasted. Some aspects of this would have been okay in 1999, but not today. 

- The guns. As a firearms enthusiast, this is what I was looking forward to the most. And I was so bitterly disappointed not just in the lack of a solid arsenal here, but with the naming convention too. We had a massive arsenal in JA2, and realistic images and names for hundreds of firearms. Why not here? Why do literally ALL the mercs have either a ""Hi Power"", ""Double Barrel"", ""Peacemaker"" or ""AK-47""? In fact, the AK is the only one that actually kept the original name of the firearm (well, that would be Kalishnakov, but that's besides the point.) Obviously even in that limited selection of firearms, anyone who knew anything about them could tell you what they looked like, and yet, the names didn't reflect that. In fact, the only thing positive about the firearms is that the ammo was somewhat realistic in the way it was depicted. 

Overall, I am so extremely disappointed with this game. Having watched the trailers, videos and seen the screenshots, I was so optimistic that it was going to be done right this time. At this point I have lost all faith that we will EVER get a faithful recreation of our beloved JA2. To be honest, if all this was was just an upscaled version of EXACTLY that game, I'd have been happy. That tells you just how little you actually had to change to make people happy. I am going to be requesting a refund.

I honestly cannot recommend JA3. It's not worthy of my time, nor the time of any real, devoted JA2 fan, and certainly not worth the name JA3.",1689388645,1689388645,False,12,2,0.392196059226989746,0,True,False,False

Spiritual successor to JA2... forget the games between 2&3 even happened.
Graphics are spot on.
Great sound design.

The Bad...
NO SHOP - They didn't put a shop into the game for buying/selling equipment, meaning you have to scrap your extra gear for parts which are so common it seems like a waste of time to even bother scrapping things; but you need to because your inventory is constantly full.
NO PAUSE - Yes it is turn based, but if you want to plan an attack before combat starts, it can be challenging without a pause/planning mode. Enemies can walk out of view, cancelling your planned attack. Enemies can also walk towards you while you are making the 6 clicks of your mouse to actually pull the trigger of your gun, which can inadvertently let the enemy start the combat and alert everyone on the map of your presence. In the several seconds it takes to select your stance, enemy, weapon, shot type, aim intensity, and which part of the enemies body you want to fire at [which takes at least a couple of seconds], all sorts of frustrating stuff can happen.
NO ACCURACY % - Yeah yeah, sounds like a cool idea... no hand holding.... but basically, I can't hit shit with anyone other than my marksman... experimenting with different weapons on different people that have different dexterity and marksman levels, at different ranges, from different elevations, on different enemies, when there is literally no indicator of how likely you are to hit something, is not just trial and error, it is mind-numbing.

OVERALL
I Like it so far [8 hours], but those 3 bad points I have listed above, are REALLY frustrating, and I cant believe they have actually made the decision to put those three things into the game in the ways they are....

As someone who revisits the VANILLA version of JA2 (the mods remove a lot of the goofy charm of JA and try to make it... something else) on a pretty regular basis on his crappy old laptop (just recently got it on steam)... I think I can say that I'm a pretty big fan of the series. 

Thankfully I avoided the ones that came after, although I almost bought RAGE until I learned that it was 4 mercs only (like seriously guys... that's like gutting side quests from Skyrim) so I have no hands on knowledge of those...titles.

What I can say though is this game freaking slaps... Sure there are a few things that are different, but that is literally video game evolution. If I wanted JA2...then I would play JA2. One thing is for sure though... There are a lot of systems in this game that seem either unfair or missing entirely  (ambushing being probably the most common one I've seen people complaining about) but the fact is... most of them are in the game but the game does a very poor job of communicating how to use them. 

I do long for at least a tactical pause during real time mode though... trying to get 6 mercs into position while the enemies are all walking around is a pretty huge pain... also the intractables are sometimes finicky when the camera isn't facing the ""right"" direction. 

But those are by and large my biggest complaints. Once you figure out ambushes, get reacquainted with sending your mercs to prone as much as you can, and also TAKE YOUR TIME... then the game becomes pretty manageable. 

The amount of weapons so far has been staggering and I literally only left the first island. The amount of armor, gear, tools, and grenades has also all been surprisingly varied. You only really have 2 enemy types on the first island, but as soon as you hit the second... I mean I ran into at least 4 new ones in the first sector. 

Speaking of enemies... this game warns you that it's gonna be a war of not only gunfights, but also of attrition... and it isn't lying. I would recommend most players play on the default difficulty with the ""To the bitter End"" turned on.   This makes combat a bit more lax (but by no means simple), and also makes some choices permanent, unless you want to restart the entire encounter.

This game really needs the good reviews because it is a GOOD game. But there is a pretty vocal group that I feel, no matter what, would never be happy with anything short of a perfect copy paste of JA2 1.13...which to me is just silly. This game is not a ""X-Com asset flip"", literally five seconds with the game will tell you that (literally one feature, the ""enemy reposition"", and the cover shields is all it has in common)

Sadly it is not and i just requested a refund.

1st problem: Co-op gameplay or not... (?)
The main feature a was waiting for was online co-op play. Jagged Alliance 3 was advertized / marketed as to feature ""online co-op"" and to allow ""to play the campaign in co-op mode""
In fact that isn't really true. After my brother hosted the first multiplayer game for our co-op campaign play, i joined and we try to create our mercenary characters via the I.M.P service. Sadly, only the host A.K.A. main player can creature his custom mercenary character. The main player actually plays the campaign like in single player mode, except that he can allow the ""other player"" to take control of a mercenary in his group. The so called ""co-op gameplay"" is in fact just a lazy (and probably late) addition to the single player mode. The ""co-op"" works on a ""drop-in / drop-out"" mode, so the host = main player plays the campaign as a single player and his co-op partner can be invited to play, then later leave, and the campaign goes on. That's at least not what *I* expect from a ""co-op-campaign feature"", as advertized.
I believe that i am not the only one who expected real co-op, and not this kind of a scam.
It's really disppointing.

2nd problem: Error + chrash when starting the game after installation
I couldn't start the game after installing, because there obviously is some kind of a zero-day bug, because on my laptop (with two GPU, 1 dedicated GeForce and 1 integrated Intel GPU) the game always uses the integrated GPU and crashes. I guess, that all owners of laptops with 2 GPU have this problem. Even forcing the game to use the dedicated GPU via NVIDIA graphic tools doesn't help. I had to disable my integrated GPU. This was not my main reason for the requested refund, but it isn't very professional by the developer either - i mean, what's QA doing before shipping the gold master, or what are they doing between gold master and release date? What about a ""day 1 patch""?

3rd problem: Massive GPU overheating even on low performance requirements 
The game has a serious and probably dangerous technical problem inside the graphics system / engine, because when starting the game after installation (A.K.A. ""out of the box"") even when only in the main menu the GPU gets extremly hot, even up to the thermal throttling threshold, though not being nearly at its limit of rendering performance. GPU temps got up to 85-90 °C with spikes even above 100°C in the main menu and on medium details, while the GPU stays at about 60-65 °C on different graphic intensive 3D-Shooters etc. on which i already hit the GPUs rendering power limits. Limiting the frame rate to 30 FPS and setting global graphics preset to ""low"" ""fixed"" the problem, so i just went up on about 80°C GPU temp. 
This is not normaly behaviour and i don't want to burn my GPU just by idling in a game's main menu, having to fear more strain on the GPU in-game.
(I have a GeForce 980M with updated NVIDIA drivers and can run the game smootly on medium details (as setup by auto-detection), but the temps went through the roof)

In summary, the game is just a huge disappointment and it was my first game i requested a refund for.
My review is *not* based on the single player experience and maybe that is good, but i waited years for having an enjoyable Jagged Alliance 3 co-op campaign experience and that just doesn't exist.
Maybe some modders will ""fix"" this during the next months and i will buy the game again, but so far it's just really disappointing.

Sadly, fitting for a video game being released in 202*, it was all words without substance.
The game is incredible poorly optimized, bordering on a possible lawsuit due to the game putting the players hardware at risk of getting damaged.

Even in the main menu, before any gameplay actually started, my gpu was scalded to temperatures near the upper allowed limit (> 85°).

The so called online coop campaign, which was advertised very early on during development, is nothing but a mind-boggling letdown. It doesn't feel like a core feature build into the game. 

Rather, it reminds me of the way a gun barrel extender was crafted in Jagged Alliance 2:

Almost 4 Hours in. I'll update this as I play.

This is finally the Jagged Alliance 2 successor I waited almost a quarter century for!
I've been a fan since the first Jagged Alliance and this is a worthy game for the series.
Runs at 1440p without any issues on an RX 470. Graphic is very nice and detailed.
No bugs so far. 

It's a great game with a lot of flair.
If you are a fan of the series: buy it!

My biggest issue: I don't like the Character Portraits you can choose when creating your MERC. Everything else: as I hoped for!

UPDATE 1:
8 Hours in. Its getting better and better. The strategic Satellite Map is very polished.

All in all the start is slow and engaging. I feel almost as excited as taking the Drassen Airport for the first time!

The Sector Maps are very good. Excellent design and with a strategic depth.

The characters and the atmosphere overall are once again excellent.  In some aspects, this game's presentation is minimalistic or let's say old-school. In Dialogues, there is no character animation, just an image and text for example. 
But then again, even the NPC villagers will have more personality than the main character in other big franchises – all due to the outstanding voice actors. Right from the beginning, the atmosphere and the interesting personalities of your mercs will suck you in. 

Warning: This game is hard. Jagged Alliance has always been hard. So don't expect this game to take you by your hand, and get gud. Failing, loading and rethinking your strategy are part of the experience. Most of the time you first attempt on a fight won't turn out great.

Recommendation: When you never played a Jagged Alliance Game before, chose the “Forgiving Mode” it still won't be too easy, but you might be less frustrated. Watch some beginner's guide videos that are already out there to prevent major mistakes right from the beginning. The rest is training. 

Conclusion: This game easily offers 100 hours of gameplay and great replayability. It's so well designed and thought-through. If you like games like X-Com or liked the old JA games, you will love this game. Period. I will add more to this review after I played it for a few more hours, but I had to give it a quick recommendation because I saw so many negative reviews that are negative for mostly laughable reasons, and this game deserves better.",1689370408,1689370408,True,3,0,0.528907954692840576,0,True,False,False

I am a fan of many modern (and old) turn based tactical shooter games like the new XCOM: EU and XCOM2, and Xenonauts

Having played 2.2 hours and having finished the first sector I think I can provide a decent opinion for which you to judge if you wish to take the plunge.

In brief, I am quite happy with this game.  The tactical engine is quite true to its JA2 roots (AP, stances, adding more AP for more accuracy, body part targeting, simulated bullets (no precentages to be found!) and more) while adding some modern conveniences like overwatch and a consistent easy to decipher cover system (which was a major gripe for JA2). 

In addtion, I feel that the mercenaries themselve have been faithfully personified (based on me having old lumenaries Grizzly, Steroid, and Hitman in my starting squad).  Their interactions seem quite faithful to their JA2 forebears with voices that competently call back to the originals (though I admit, no one can beat the original voice actors, but such is life).

There has been a sizable amount of skeptism leading up to this games release, but for (and one of) the old guard I attest that this game is a worthy successor to JA2.  I highly recommend this game.

Way back in 1999, a little ole title named Jagged Alliance 2 (JA2) was my first experience in the series and it stole my heart. Easily top 5 of the 1000s of games I've played in my life and maybe even top spot!  While I'm also a fan of some of the modern games like Xcom, Phantom Doctrine, Invisible Inc, Battletech, to name a few, nothing has quite captured the feel of Jagged Alliance 2 until now!

There are some quirky design choices, like mixing right and left mouse clicks for movement in different modes, however the overall spirit and feel of JA2 is captured in JA3!  On the mouse clicking, there is an option to make all movement Left mouse. Admittedly I prefer movement be right though. :(

Combat is fun and deadly. Thankfully there is no hand holding and this is really a game of tactical decisions and risk.  You have to think, not just run in blindly.

The lack of To Hit % on shots doesn't bother me at all, it captures that risk/reward and really does force you into risky moves. Great decision there.

The cast of mercenaries are just as campy 90s as ever and their banter makes it worth playing a few times through just to mix and match combinations.

Co-Op which is super important to me, works great. It's a little quirky but I get why they had to do it the way they did. Maybe one day we'll get a true co-op version where each player gets their own unit and you can team up, but for now this works and was a blast to play with my buddy.

Give this game an honest open try and you'll likely really be pleased.  If you looking for an Xcom clone or something similar to the more recent failed JA spinoffs, it might not be for you, but a true fan of Turn Base Tactics/Strategy games is going to have a blast and spin countless hours in this title.",1689368310,1689368310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You start with picking up your squad trying to get the team together via some kind of chit chat device, all the mercs give you quotes based on what their story is or even relations to other characters that you could possibly hire. It's bunch of stats and abilities we like that stuff also the voicelines are a very nice touch. 

You may also make your own character that will be built by 10 funny questions and then it will be buiilt by your personality.

The game tries to be funny, ever seen expandables ? well it's exactly that.

Some people say the game is quite laggy, i am running a laptop RTX 3070 1920x1080 resolution with high to mid settings i usually put shadows and post processing on normal to get some work load off my CPU, i am running around 90-120 FPS which is playable just fine but there definitely can be improvement. It seem that the first mission was quite intesive also i am running now my capped 120 FPS stable on the next maps.

I love the UI but i hate the stealth for now, i wish i could see an outlines of what is the view of enemies or something that would present a space i can hide behind or hide inside like a bush.
For now stealth for me is tidious and useless as i am trying to do something and i keep getting absolutely cucked.

There is already a mod by the devs on workshop that will allow you to see the hit chance on enemies in case you want to see that like XCOM or any top down strategy shooting game does.

There is also campaign multiplayer which sounds absolutely wicked and i have no clue how it works at all? but even in single player it seems you can have multiple squads on map and give them orders what to do scout it seems that you can even have multiple strategy fights going on two different maps and god i love the way the map looks, i hope there will be some research tree i can get behind do a bit more advanced gameplay decide what do next with my friend or solo, i am not sure it might be already in the game i just finished like 3 missions now.",1689364591,1689368031,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Yes. it looks nice, and it works on modern system. That's all from positives.

You no longer can order supplies. Everything have to be either fixed or scavenged. Loot from enemies is also not guaranteed. Moreover - do you need more ammo? suck for you. Enemies may have unlimited ammo, but once they die you have 5-20 rounds, regardless if your opponent shot something or not.

encounters are set to be incredibly defensive - i.e. most beneficial way of cleaning the map is to aggro and lure the enemies to the place you have upper hand in, and you are entrenched. In JA2 you could have been aggressive if you want, here not.

You can not stop time. You do not have time to plan stuff. You have no idea how good are you (did it missed because i have 10% to hit or 99%? should i try again? etc) so planning is besides the point. Stealth is just plain tiring to pull off. On top of that  you still can miss or fail your take down attack rendering all the time you put into stealth useless. And obviously, enemy magically knows if the guy that walks behind him is friendly or foe.
Stealth gameplay is so unreliable its pointless.

i've built a character - 85 (max) in most of the things you would need for shooting - and still random dude with AK hits me more often than I him. There is barely any suppression mechanics (besides skill) making it plain not fair. 

Then i built a character focused on meelee - and he got mowed down in 3rd map or so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Shotguns are working like in most shooters now - 3 meters and the spread is so big you will deal like 14 damage max if you hit anything in the first place, less reliable than simple starting pistol.

Headshots are now not always lethal - good for immersion you may argue. 

To add fuel to the fire, it causes fires to computers or at least tries to. Optimization is not existent. Recently played Aliens Dark Descent that looks really decent, and works 10 times better than JA3.

- the game is also I think very poorly optimized. There is no way a game with these graphics should put even just 2070 super to its limits... Despite the bad graphics it is unbelievable to me that the performance is still so bad you have to turn down settings and cap frames

- The movement/interactions are VERY junky. Sometimes it is straight up impossible to click on lootable objects when you are infront of them, it is just impossible to find a mouse position where it changes to looting and you have to run around trying to find a clickable position

This is a proper sequel and I think all the devs who worked on this deserve a well-earned pride. The game is simply fantastic! The music, the sounds, voice acting, the art, effects, and gameplay… I can see that the game was made with such passion.

Firstly I was very skeptical. “What is just another cash grab?” or “Another game just using known IP just to present their own weird ideas?” Simply no! If you are born before 1990 you will get the setting, the humor… 

This is a complete game, have no mistake about that! There is also room for improvement. Mainly the combat AI needs a few adjustments to have less friendly fire on each other and use more abilities. The campaign AI slightly be more challenging as well. It just needs to be slightly more aggressive and it is well done.

I hope they continue the patching and improve the overall experience. Better technical optimization and AI that is. The rest is all well. But I want to have a few DLCs. Vehicles: Jeeps, tanks, etc.. and rations&water for mercs.

The love is there, and respect for the spirit, just developer who wasn't the most experienced, but defo did their best. That and tight budget, as unless you check the text dumps (which won't even be prompted to you) you will miss out on basic mechanics, like how to stealth.

Same you will miss exactly how overwatch works. It's not like xcom, its equivalent of the interrupt-triggers-interrupt-trigger-interrupt system, but with set overwatch on top

But honestly most of the issues are relatively easily fixable, especially performance as that's something that's hard, but gets A LOT easier when you get tons of data.

Pros:
+ Combat: very well done. Absolutely nothing negative to say on it. Engaging, entertaining, full of possibilities. 
+ Mood, Atmosphere: excellent, they nailed it so well
+ Audio: Very good, I like what has been done with the Merc's voices.
+ Merc selection: Great. No complaints so far.
+ Freedom of action: I tested a couple of different ways to do the first village combat, both resulted in a very fluid and rewarding experience and were resolved completely differently (in a good way). So yeah, multiple approaches are possible and different. Very sandboxy, I like it.
+ New stuff: Perks and hackables are a welcome addition, as well as special mercs abilities.

Neutral:
* GUI: On one hand is a bit clunky, it's not too immediate how to do things. On the other hand, it's very informative, and pretty complete
* Strategy Layer: Too early to tell to be honest. Same with weapon selection and equipment.
* Difficulty: For me it's more than ok so far, but I can see how it can be a bit difficult for newcomers.
* Graphics: It's ok, but there's some effects that eat framerates
* CO-OP: Haven't tested it yet.

Cons:
- So far I've not been able to enter Turn Based Mode at will. It would be useful to initiate combat (for instance, with stealth melee kills, which are absurdly difficult to queue).
- Tutorial is inexistent. If you know the series you won't need it, but it's a bad oversight on their part
- You can't send flowers to the Major :|

I played all JA games back then and so i suffered quite a lot with all those subpar quasi-successors. Here are some main differences that I noticed after 1 hour of play (and watching lots of CCs the days before).
- Buhu, where is merc xy? He/She is not here. Its maybe 50 times the effort to implement one merc compared to 25 years ago. Most fan favourites are there and for the rest there will be Mods / DLCs, so stay calm.
- Time units changed. The mercs dont have 25 or 100 actions points but rather 10-12. You get used to it.
- IMP is still a thing so you can make your own merc. The pictures are only 6 and look awful though. --> mods
- AI seems quite smart and will challenge most players even on the lowest difficulty
- They maps are way smaller  and have quite some impassable terrain. Enemies are fewer in numbers also, no more 1.13 fights ageinst 80 Elites
- Mercs have unique (limited use) abilities now. Imho they fit in quite well.
- Dead enemies drop like in JA2 ramdom stuff and not every enemy drops something. I always liked it that way but we will see for sure a ""drop everything"" mod soon.
- Graphics are ok but the game seems a bit stuttering and laggy (240 FPS on RTX 3060) , will probably be optimised.
