So that means I love it and it's exactly what I wanted, although if the developer reads this I do have one or two things that I think could maybe smooth out some of its rougher edges.

For instance, I initially assumed the ""sell all unlocked"" button meant unlocked as in I had discovered the name - not used the lock icon in the same menu to prevent selling (which makes sense in retrospect, but I hadn't paid attention to those icons before and this game doesn't explain it to you). This caused me to sell everything early on instead of clearing space for the fish that would actually count towards discoveries/progression, which was easy enough to recover from but a bit of a surprise. While I don't think this game necessarily needs the option to sell all discovered fish I do think it could be neat especially later on when painted/gold versions become the only new unlocks in a lower tier.

The only other thing I want to mention is that for an idle game it requires pretty much constant attention even with the ""fewer clicks"" mode due to the way the fish behave. Right clicking to start placing food without  maintaining mouse movement causes most of the smaller fish to orbit around the food and not actually eat much of it at all. This has led me to making constant small circular motions with the mouse in order to see any real progression even early on where the economy is usually a little more forgiving. This could very well be an intentional design decision, but to me it felt a little at odds with a design philosophy that already catered towards hand problems somewhat with the aforementioned fewer clicks mode (which I do really appreciate! I just found it a little ineffective when it came to reducing hand stress with the required constant motion).

With that being said I got this game on sale via (the) gnorp bundle and I think it's great! If what you see for the gameplay videos looks nice to you or simply enjoyable to have on a second monitor I really think you should get this (especially for only ~$5). My nitpicks are small and more quality of life grievances than anything and I'm really glad I took the chance to try this one out.

You start with an empty aquarium that you buy packs for which give you 4 random fish, each fish gives a certain amount of money per (real-time) day.
Once you get enough money you can buy more aquariums and fill them with fish to increase your daily earnings even more.

With a recent update they added a ""Less clicking"" mode which helps you make your fish grow up faster without having to spam or autoclick, otherwise they will just grow up overtime (with some rare/mythical fish taking up to 7 days).

Only real downsides are the lack of music variety and because the fish packs are RNG you won't always get the ones you want & you'll have to grind a few packs to get the more rare ones to finish off your discovered species.

Brackish Friends:

Common: Orange Molly, Wild Guppy, Bumblebee Goby, Barred Mudskipper, Atlantic Mudskipper, Knight Goby Indian Glassy fish, African Moony, Silver Moony, Common Toadfish, Figure 8 Pufferfish

Rare: Black Molly, Sailfin Molly, American Flag Fish, Green Spotted Pufferfish, Violet Goby, Water Cow, Orange Chromide,

Epic: Green Chromide, Banded Archerfish, Targetfish, Ruby Scat,

Legendary: Colombian Shark Catfish, Black Lyretail Tail Molly,

Mythic: Four Eyed Fish

Also put it in freshwater and one after rivers and ponds and make it 10 - 100k i think 50k would work

My only recommendation to improve the game is a minor quality of life update, which is the ability to use the ESC key (or any hotkeys) to open up the menus... Sometimes I trap my fish in a corner being fed to grow faster, and it's a tad annoying to drag my mouse all around to open everything. But even without that change, it's such a lovely game, and I can't recommend it more for the price. I can't wait to try out other games by the developer.",1707133655,1707133655,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Has QoL features, like an overview per tank where you can sort your fish and sell all unwanted ones in that tank with 1 mouseclick.
In ""options"" you can choose ""less mouse clicks"", which is very welcome.

The fish resemble real fish and it is nice to try build your own RL fish tanks. You gradually get to buy more tanks, so you can have growing tanks and a show tank.

I check 2 to 3 times a day to check and sell matured fish and buy new fish.
Each adult fish swimming around earns you money continuously. Some fish are worth more than others.

Decorations should be in their own toggable ""decor"" mode so your not constantly clicking them. Lights and different pebble types should do something more than just decorate the tank.

Lots of missed chances for active idle people. Once you get to the higher tanks with 100+ fish ( Which is within an hour or two)  the amount of clicking to sell stuff gets to be the main thing your doing. No upgrades outside of the food, but when your using a somewhat broken mechanic in the game food doesn't super matter anyway. I just wish there was more option and variety to the gameplay loop. 

I think the game is great but its missing some easily addable features and improvements that I am honestly surprised were overlooked.

Was loving the game. Very relaxing and enjoyable idle game with no MTX. I would leave it running overnight on occasion. That was my downfall. Left it running overnight last night and when I came back home today my computer had frozen up, so I had to use the force restart button on my tower which essentially cycles the power. Come back to the game and I have all of the same aquariums. (Fresh 1, 2, and 3 + Salt 1) But I have ZERO saltwater fish, and all of the fish in my freshwater tanks are completely identical. I also had 0 money. I had been finally getting through the marine dwellers. I've now lost weeks worth of progress and, frankly, my interest in the game. Could it be an issue with my PC and not the game? Possibly. But it was the only program left running overnight and here I am today, fishless and penniless.

The core loop is:
  - buy the most expensive fish you can

Collecting all painted and normal fish variants is easy, however the golden and rainbow? Honestly really, really boring. With an empty maxed tank you can open 25 packets at once. You are not guaranteed even a single gold within that opening. And when you do get a gold, it is not guaranteed to be unique.

This means for those final few achievements you will be having to sit there opening and discarding packets for hours upon hours with little to no variation. It would be less painful if the odds of golden fish could be increased, or simply having larger tanks, but alas, as of yet there is nothing.

- make it so that the adult fish can't consume fish food so that you can prioritize growing your baby fish first.
- UI is clunky. Could/should use visual improvement, especially in the case when you're locking up your legendary fish for saving before bulk selling other fish. Not a huge fan of scrolling through upwards of 100 fish and double checking which fish are locked because the lock/unlock sign is the same white/blue color scheme with minor changes. Also, this is a minor point, but renaming the fish has no tangible effect on gameplay or the visuals, nor does it play some role in the filtering options for the lists, so I'm unsure why it's in this game.
- add more impactful decorations worth buying from the store beyond the draggable fish decoration PNGs and recolors for the fish light and aquarium ground. 
- maybe a bit more music tracks? I enjoy the current selection, but I feel as if it's so short that it feels repetitive.

I'm sure there's many features you can add to this game that could expand it beyond what it already offers and still have it feel like an idle experience. And I do hope that dev continues to update it with new gameplay ideas. If I could give it a numerical rating out of 10 for how well it succeeds as an idle game, I'd give it a 7 (closer to a 6).",1706053697,1706053697,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most idle games out there try to milk their players with micro transactions, and this game does not. Big point in its favor. Most idle games don't really end, with an ever increasing grind that could take years to actually finish. This game does end after about 20 hours or so, maybe 40 if you do a lot of collecting. Small point in its favor.

Even though this game dodges some of the worst tendencies found in idle games, at the end of the day its just ok. Its not terribly engaging, and while it is kind of relaxing, its also not that much to look at. The idea is you have an aquarium of fish to look at while it idles, but the animations and fish designs really aren't that great. The cosmetic options are there and its better than bare bones, but only just. The gameplay is mostly figuring out how to make money efficiently with your fish, which I do enjoy, but its not quite intricate enough to be satisfying.

One thing I will praise is the pacing. Even though there are significant milestones, you reach them all in a fairly timely manner, especially with efficient play. Most idle games give you a few milestones every hour to start with which then slows to crawl with a milestones every few days or even weeks. This game stays consistent with giving you big upgrades every hour or two, basically up to the end. 

For me the bottom line is that I had a good time and it didn't overstay its welcome. A good idle game to mess around with while watching videos or even while playing other games. A good use for your second screen.",1705685089,1705685089,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

but on a more serious note, it's fun ! you chill, you quarium, what more could you want? the dev seems responsive to feedback as well, and the game is updated semi-regularly ( i believe i read that it's a one-man team, and he is doing this part-time while in college ? but i may be wrong soooo,,, the updates come as often as i expect given those circumstances though. ) with qol updates or new features ( at the time of writing, i am currently holding out for the ability to host one of each fish in my tanks, as the new painted varieties mean i cannot have a living dex, but i have faith that the dev will follow through with this within an update or two, since i'm sure he knows it's a highly requested feature ) 

not recommended really if you prefer a more active play-style since it is an idle game first and foremost, but if you mess around with it a bit, it's not too hard to figure out a way to lose an hour or so at a time to grinding for money or gold / rainbow fish, so all hope is not lost for those that want to quarium more than they want to chill.",1705655242,1705655242,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I am 37.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The people came, the drinks were flowing and it was all the Rage. This game was not for me. I enjoyed the party but when it came to my fish, I wanted it to be as relaxed as possible. What could I possibly do..... Then out of the blue pops up, Chillquarium. Could it be? A relaxed fish tank game that is all about ""taking it easy"" enjoying yourself and having a good time. I was in disbelief. Thinking to myself, that last fish tank game was quite ruckus. I was not at all able to relax let alone, ""Chill."" Alas I was incorrect. This game was all that and more. Sitting here Setting up my Chillquarium has been nothing more than a relaxed, zenlike, calming experience. The most stressful part of this game is waiting to get that next installment of awesome fish. 

All jokes aside this game is really fun. You unlock fish and try and complete collections all while generating income and buying more fish packs. 

It's great. I got it on sale for 6 bucks Canadian. Two Twonies and two loonies eh. Bought the Old lady a copy. She's Chill now as well. We are all chilling out at the Quarium. 

So just Chill out and get Chillquarium. I've got 70 hours of fishy fun under my belt.

Gameplay wise it's like a gacha game but without MTX, the fish packs you buy give you totally random fish and they can come in normal, painted, or golden variety, adding to the gambling element. You work your way up through the fish packs starting on the freshwater friends, only little tiny fish which do not make much money, to the more exotic fish, and all away to the giants which I haven't got to yet but I assume includes stuff like the ocean sunfish. It's a pretty decent progression system IMO at least so far for me, you don't have to play the game very actively though you can speed it up a little bit by feeding the fish which gives them XP to grow more.

I think what the game could do with though is a bit more content and depth. Right now it feels very barebones, there are a few things you can tinker around with and customise but not much. Though this game did only come out a few months ago so hopefully in the future the developers will add some more stuff.

At the end of the day, this is a glorified $5 screensaver that you can click on. It is frustrating because the concept of the game is solid and the art style is fun. But when you look at the shop you realize just how little effort went into making this game. There are so many things that the developers could have added to this game, to name a few off the top of my head unique idle animations, unique feeding animations, a lot more ways to personalize and decorate your fishtanks, more packs than 5, more fish tanks, and the list goes on and on.

It gets very monotonous especially since there isn't much content right now and very little ways to customize your tank.

Fish... this must be the only game on steam about fish where you get the fish for real, non of that accurate fantasy, no made up fantasy, no open world survival, no need to manage and build bases or fight dumb fish and have to level up skills, worry about the environment, buffs and debuffs, non of that complicated nonsense.... I don't know, I don't care... I am not searching through many video games on steam... some have fish like this but only simpler ones you'll find on a house... others are probably overly complicated to just get a simple fish but look at the graphics!, this game has more fish from many places and you get the fish fast, slowly at the beginning like what did you expect? You have to start somewhere but after just 1 week, I don't have space in the first fish tank and it's maxed at 100 fish.

Sadly the game is a idler, all I do is check on the fish once a day, sell some, get more.. close and wait until tomorrow, the prices for things are totally exaggerated judging how little content there is so far which makes sense... I hope that with more updates and more content, the prices regulate to make a more constant growth.... the game allows you to feed the fish to make them grow but it is slow and inefficient... there should be more options to minimize the idling side.

I don't know Dev but it's too late for me, I am doing the fish now... The game makes sense for a 1 Dev team or some small Dev team... I hope Dev adds deep sea stuff like the Mariana trench some day because they glow and the abyss is cool, I am not expecting updates anyways but this game has potential to become a longer term something something game... the ones where you spend a lot of time in...

To make the short point long: This game is an idler w/gacha elements that *don't* cost you your wallet. As time passes, whether it's within hours or in days, you earn enough money to get the next batch of fish you'd like (which is the gacha element essentially, you buy 4 random fish in a pack), or upgrade the fish food, or buy that one decoration you think looks neat! It's very low-stakes since you're just filling in your fish collection and the decorations are, well, decorative, up to you to do something with. 

At first the pricetags of all the items look daunting, but I think they're mostly well balanced for the simplicity of this game. I'd recommend popping into it every once in awhile just to see what new fish have grown and what else you can do to complete collections! ...Unless you're like me, and like having the fish keep you company on your desk, and thus rack up many more hours than seems reasonable.

But still it's one of the most fun Idle games I've ever played.

It's not as ""addicting"" and sometimes the pace is sub-optimal, but the relaxing atmosphere and pretty graphics make up for it.

You can buy sets of baby fish and wait until they grow up or manually feed them (by clicking). Once they grow up you can sell them or let them generate income. There are multiple ""stages"" e.g. fresh water and salt water and you can unlock better fish or additional tanks. Everything is very basic, but that makes it simpler and not as stressfull.

You start off with a small tank and through buying random fish ""decks"" in gacha-style you collect rare fish that are worth more when grown.

Growing fish (maturing) takes real life time where the game can be closed and still 100% progressing the growth rate. I would advise ""playing"" this game more like a daily check-in type of experience where you get to see what progress was made during the day or when the game was closed.

At the start, fish don't bring in a lot of money/day but as you progress, numbers go up. With the money (profit) you get from selling your fish, you buy upgrades for your watertank, your fish food gives out more XP/bite and decorations for your tank.

Major plus for this game:
- Price in sale
- Progression of maturity of fish continues offline
- Cute graphics, perfect in windowed mode on a second monitor
- Amazing relaxing soundscape
- Accessibility options to have less clicks needed (for example: 1 click for food and food keeps coming automatically from the cursor point) 

Negatives:
- Not the depth of a cookie clicker experience
- there is no strategy, pure luck and hunting for achievements might take a while depending on the luck.

Enjoy it as a casual hop in hop out experience, ive been just coming back daily, slowly progressing. If you want continuous dopamine hits or continuous gameplay, this is not it. If you want a chill daily progression gacha-style game, this is it.

Now that I have one hundred of my very own wahoos, they exclaim for me. I simply tab on when the word should be said, and they shout it one hundred times.

As an aquarium enthusiast, I was excited to see real fish and how they were represented as drawings. Each time you buy fish, you don't know which ones you're going to get, like a mystery box. I liked collecting them all. I also enjoyed the progression from guppy to giant squid and all the interesting things in between.
It was worth the price I paid for it. 

Some criticisms: The fish from the 'giant' category, which is the last tier, aren't all that big. I was disappointed by that after being excited for them through all the other tiers, but it wasn't a game-breaker. And while the UI is generally pretty thoughtful, there are still a few improvements that could be made in my opinion. Additionally, the game allows you to change the color of the light in each aquarium, which is awesome, but it changes the way that looks at night [in real time], and I wish there was a way to turn that functionality off.

The fish graphics are meh, customization is minimal.  But it's just kind of a pleasant little thing.  I'd give it a middle-grade, but as you know, it's thumbs up or down, right?

I like pixel graphics, but I think I might be docking points because I know the fish and the portrayal of the fish in terms of shapes, size, and color could be better, even in pixel graphics.

You can easily figure out how the pathing on the fish works and there's a ""fewer clicks"" option in the setting that makes it so creating food is click to start/stop instead of click per food.  Combine those two and you can speed grow everything so time is never a real factor.

I wanted a laid back point and click game to have on the side while I'm playing my other main game (Satisfactory).

I thought I'd be playing for 30 minutes but I played for 12 hours yesterday.  Very simple and so far it's been fun collecting every fish.

Only gripe I have is with the drop rate for gold/painted legendary and mythic fish which I'll bet will take a thousand hours, so I only plan on collecting my base ""pokedex"" of fish.

Other than that, totally worth the money.  Just one tip, use the ""fewer clicks option"" so that you don't get carpel tunnel.  BUT remember to turn it off before opening up your packs of fish so you can open them one by one and enjoy discovering your new fish!  Once you've unlocked all of them for a certain set, you can def go back to fewer clicks while opening them.

No. You get a different colored Jpeg for millions of coins. The same Jpeg as every other background, but this time, 15 x as expensive, and in shades of green! 

It's a wallpaper.

for the price of 6 dollars, if you need to scratch that idle game itch, there are dozens of games much better, like Melvor.

this game is super fun if you got nothing else to do and just want something to free play. the ""less clicks"" option makes the game a lot easier and fun to play. BUT i have a few things that i think that could help it be more pleasing to play.

-A better way to navigate the fish ""viewer"", particularity a way to see certain fish you have a dupe of (including the painted and gold versions) so its easier to get rid of them when you already have said fish.

-a way to scroll through the opened fish packs without them disappearing

-easier progression, its super tasking to sit through and hold down the mouse on a certain fish to unlock the adult version

-cheaper upgrades, and more options as far as upgrades

-a like decor mode ish that has more available/cheaper ways to decorate the tank

i think that's it!! love the game sooooo much its unreal!! looking forward to any updates in the future!!

It reminded me of the Screensaver game mode from the CD version of Insaneaquarium. As a result, it is difficult for me to play this game without directly comparing it with its ""competition.""

I really love the variety in the fish as well as the possibility to get rare fish. As far as the amount of unique fish models and colors go, the game offers a lot.

However, I would really like to see an improvement on the art style of the game, as all the assets look like artificially upscaled pixel art. I think it would look more charming as pixel art, and the developer could perhaps spend some time making the props, decorations, and background art look more sophisticated by improving the lighting/light source, studying more about making a pleasing palette for background art, etc. As of now, it appears a little ""gloopy"" due to (I assume) to be the upscaling situation. I recall looking at the background props and finding the art to look kind of smudged or like some colors were unintentionally or not confidently placed.  

Secondly, I feel like the game offers a great deal of content for its price, but it could stand to have a few more gameplay elements. It could perhaps introduce more ""milestones"" such as giving small rewards for ""sell 10 fish, sell 20 fish, sell 50 fish, etc."" It could also take some inspiration from its competition by adding in ""useful"" decorations or permanent resident fish that proc their abilities at well-paced intervals: fish that give birth to more fish, or a tank upgrade that automatically feeds your fish, were some ideas that came to mind. I'd also like to see a built-in screensaver mode.

Additionally, some quality-of-life improvements: I recommend an option to sort fish by the amount of experience they need to become full grown. Sometimes I like to try to ""prioritize"" feeding the ones that are closest to growing. It'd be easier to find them if I could sort by experience. (If I can already do this, I overlooked it!)

 I think the game is very charming and well-priced on its own, and I always enjoy supporting indie devs. My suggestions are just ideas, they may or may not vibe with your vision.",1705111996,1705111996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The game is very calming, watching your fish swim around is neat and the color variations (painted, golden, etc.) are attractive to look at which makes them fun to collect
- The early game is VERY slow- I ended up taking advantage of an exploit to make it go along faster. However it seems once you hit river and reef fish it speeds up considerably. Still, I feel like the smallest fish should make you more money as right now even the rarest small fish don't make more than common/rare river fish so there's no reason to keep any of them beyond aesthetics. Also the mythic (highest rarity) small fish is kind of a joke in terms of earning power
- The number of tanks you get seems limiting- there's only 3 freshwater and 3 saltwater tanks. I wanted to make one or two aesthetic tanks, a golden fish tank, and a rainbow fish tank (maybe) for both salt and freshwater fish, but since you only get 3 of each and one of them will almost always be your ""meta"" money earning tank I'll probably have to cut something.
- It would be nice if the fish had a bit more personality, like maybe special interactions between certain species of fish or with decorations. The designs are attractive but at the moment they just feel like floating pngs.
- The number of decorations seems slightly limited, and it would be nice if you could recolor them.

Given that the game only came out late last year (so a couple of months ago at the time of writing) the fact that it's a bit barebones is understandable, and the dev seems hard at work adding new features. The game itself is also fun. Still though, part of me thinks that this should have been labeled as an early access game...

However, being aware that the game is from an independent indie developer, there are some oversights and issues that I'd like to see addressed. Primarily, the game seems restricted to the standard 16:9 aspect ratio. Allowing for 21:9, 16:10, etc., is crucial for any modern game.

Then the ability to purchase the ""Salt Water"" tank is available long before you can actually afford to buy any fish for that tank. Some balancing is needed here, or perhaps when acquiring a new tank, including some ""free fish"" as a starter kit, similar to what you'd get at an actual pet store, could be beneficial.

Moving on to the cosmetic upgrades, they are quite expensive. While this might be acceptable if they were reusable, once placed, your only option is to delete them. Being unable to put items into storage for reuse or move decorations between tanks feels like a basic feature that should be implemented.

Lastly, the game itself could use a cosmetic refresh. While it does have its own style, it reminds me of a Windows 98 fish wallpaper. It's possible that this is intentional on the developer's part, and I'm not expecting the latest RTX graphics, but aiming for something a bit more timeless might be a worthwhile pursuit. In reality this is another game I'd prefer to rate as ""neutral"" - but it's definitely not deserving of a negative review as it still offers exactly what it promises to you.",1705069794,1705069794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

e.g. You will earn 20$ each raised fish from the starter pack. But after you can buy the next pack that cost 1000$. You immediately will get 500$ if you raised and sold the 1000$ pack fish.
So there are no reasons for player to keep buying those cheap fish pack because they can't really get more profit out of it.
Meanwhile, fish from the more expensive fish pack may not be your type of fish. You get them just so sell them. It makes the game kinda grindy and the chill part is out.
The progression is based on when you can earn enough and buy the next more expensive fish card pack. It is very predictable after a few hour into the game (After you understand the economy of it)

It feels a bit unbalanced, as upgrades are unsubstantial but very expensive, deterring you from active gameplay in preference of a much more hands-off real time aquarium sim. I can see the vision, and I respect that some players may prefer a more 'realistic' aquarium simulation, but from the approach of it being an incremental/'idler' game I think the option between a ""realistic"" difficulty and a ""casual"" difficulty would be welcome. 

Decor items also feel needlessly expensive to the point where they go from *decor* items to a weird form of money sink side-progression that ultimately leads to nowhere and distracts you from the actual core gameplay loop of saving up enough money to purchase the next fish packet. I think all decor items should either be relatively cheap, *or* provide some sort of gameplay incentive, e.g happier fish produce more money and mature faster.

On its surface it's a very simple game, but when you get into it you find...it's a very simple game!

It has absolutely no draining, straining or frustrating elements - except for manic completionists who need to find all the fish and find them SOON. They NEED it! (They kinda includes me, but never mind).

The fish grow at specified time levels. Common can grow relatively swiftly and legendary and mythic need you to get on with your life and come back later or even a couple of days later. You can speed up the process by feeding the fish, but the game is not meant for speed. It's a screen saver with gameplay elements. And it's great.

I'm not sure how I feel about the ""real time"" aspect of the game (the fish continue to grow even with the game shut off). On one hand, it removes the fun of hearing them (yes, they make a little ""pop"" sound when they mature) grow up. On the other, some of those higher level fish have seemingly impossible growth spans. I'm gonna side with it's okay and just remember to load up the tank before going to sleep each day.

I do wish there was a little more in-game (simple) functionality. There is no in-game ""help"" and though the game is simple and intuitive, it would be nice to have some tips or explanations. I couldn't tell if the ""earns $x.xx per day"" actually earned you money or if you needed to just sell the fish. Staring at the screen for a while finally showed a penny being added, so I got my answer.

Some keyboard shortcuts would also be nice. The developer added a ""less clicks"" choice to help out the mouse impaired (or injured), so to top it off, a key binding to pull up the fish tank, fish list and store would be cool.

BUT!!!!

This game is already cool. And, like the title says, chill. Get it now. Reward this developer for such a nice concept and then reward yourself with a cute and peaceful little game!",1704877501,1704878721,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

You force feed your little fry or just let them grow-up in time.  You sell them to buy more eggs, or patiently wait for enough coins from their idle income.  You start getting variants.  Painted, golden, RAINBOW!  You find more tiers!  Rare, epic, legendary, MYTHIC!  You can't decide what you should spend money on first...a new tank, a new type of fish or a mossball? You watch your coins per day income tick slowly upward.  $100, $1000, $1,000,000!  You get ridiculously excited over some cute little creature (I'm looking at you, rainbow axolotl).
You can play low speed as a full idle, or you can play it a little faster by clicking to feed your fish.  Either way, it is a pleasant way to discover the fluidity of time as somehow, mysteriously, your minutes turned into hours and you just need a few more coins to buy more eggs...again.
A couple things I liked:
1. Progress from the demo carried over into the full game.  There is a data reset option, and I did use it, but having that choice was nice.
2. Artwork.  It is simple, but it works well with the vibe of the game.
3. Buy all and sell all options.  This can speed things up and save some of the clicking if you are a grinder.
4. Light colors.  It was nice to be able to get different colors of lights and gravel to reduce eyestrain.
5. You can name your fish.

Didn't like:
1. Experienced a bug where my fish would vanish sometimes.  When I only had one tank, I had to close and re-open the game to get them back.  It would show them in my list of fish, but not let me feed them or see them.  Once I had additional tanks, I could just switch between tanks and they would reappear.
2. Decorations can only be moved on the horizontal plane they start off on.  No options for foreground or background.

QOL features I'd like to see added:
1. An income counter for the total of all tanks, not just the tank you are currently viewing.
2. An option to disable the automatic night light.  Yes, you can manually turn the lights on each time, but it defaults back to automatic.
3. Update the fish checklist to show all painted variants.  Maybe as a drop down from the current thumbnails.  I'm not a raving completionist, but it would be nice to know if I have completed a collection.

You have a marvelous game on your hands here, Ben Reber.  Thank you for the demo version.  It made the decision for me to treat myself to the full game for Christmas.",1704065388,1704331896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I honestly feel like this game is missing quite a lot. Once you get to the third collection of fish, you start to realize that the game has nothing else to offer. there's nothing to do with your fish other than to collect them. Feed them food (aka idle for several minutes) And just pull the crank on the fish Slot machine.

I feel like this game would do amazing if it was converted into some sort of wallpaper for a desktop. Because it's just enough content to be entertaining in that situation. if you want a little something to waste time every here and there. This game is great for that.

---

There's nothing chill about this game, nor fun, either. 

For a while, I enjoyed this game, even before the hotfix that actually made it manageable without an autoclicker, but the longer I played it, the more issues I realised it has, especially in regards to achievement hunting. 

It's tedious and grindy, like not even voodoo garden involved grind where the harder you work, the more progress you make. This will take dozens of hours, even with a min-max auto-clicker in the bottom of your screen. It's the boring grind that steals your mouse hostage and leaves you looking at your phone because you can't use your PC, because playing any other way will take you at least triple the amount of time. Because, oh my gosh, is this game slow paced. 

The unlockables, tanks and fish tiers take forever, and not in a satisfying way, because you're not doing anything. You're just waiting for it to say you can get the next thing, and whilst this can be fun at first having something to aim for - when you get to the last tier of fish, it becomes idle-game levels of ""oh my god how long do I have to wait to unlock this"". 

And when it isn't an idle game? The controls and UI are horrifically optimised. You want to see all your adult fish in the tank in the tab you're in? Jokes on you, you have to cycle through every tab to ""refresh"" the adult fish tab because it doesn't count any new ones since you last pressed the tab. You want to fill a 100-fish tank? Get ready to press that ""buy 4 fish"" 25 times, and then press the card packs 25 times to unlock the fish, then press every fish. Then do that for all 6 of your 100-fish tanks. Every 8 hours. Do you know how clunky and poorly optimised this game is? Someone described this as a good game to play when you're stoned on your second monitor - and you'd need to be to have the patience for it.

^ And if you want achievements? If you want golden fish or rainbow fish? Do that entire process repeatedly, selling all your baby fish (that need to be refreshed in the tab every time!) getting 0.05% odds on hopefully pulling one of the hundreds of fish you need. You can be sat here opening fish packs for hours. It's tedium incarnate. 

It's not fun, it's poorly made, and I miss those 41 hours of my life.",1696508299,1703676398,False,9,3,0.529817700386047363,0,True,False,False

[i]Chillquarium[/i] is a lovely little idle game of raising fish in a series of aquariums.  It's not much more than that, really, but it's pretty.

You start out buying packs of fish.  Each pack contains four fishies, but it's a random draw within that pack's group, out of sixteen species in each of five groups  There are common, rare, epic, and legendary species within each group.

Each species has normal, painted, and golden varieties, with painted and golden worth more than normal.

There is a small idle component to the game.  Fishies start out as small baby fish and take a few minutes to about a week to grow up.  You can right-click to drop a bit of fish food to help them grow up a bit faster.  Once grown, fishies earn money.

You can also sell off fish for money.  Selling baby fish gets you a few cents each, but selling most adult fish easily gets much more than the price of an entire pack.  You can select individual fishies and lock them so you can't easily sell them, especially with the ""sell all"" button.

A listing of the fish in a tank can be sorted by various categories, including income and value.  You can rename individual fishies, but neither name nor species are sorting categories.

Max capacity of a tank is 100 fish, which makes it complicated and tricky to select a fish swimming about.  Fortunately, you can also select fish in the tank's list.


Accumulating money allows you to buy the more expensive packs, upgrade tank capacity, add decorations, or purchase new tanks.  You can have three freshwater tanks, and three saltwater tanks.

Decor is sadly limited, just large tank ornaments such as a castle or boulder, several colors of sand for the bottom, and several colors of lighting.

The only impactful upgrade beside new tanks and tank capacity is one that increases the fish growth XP of the fish food.

The game is soothing to watch.  Fishies are bright and colorful cartoon versions of various real species, including classics like goldfish, koi, bettas, and clownfish, as well as deeper sea fish like viperfish and bottomfeeding flounder.  A snail or two can also be found.

There's a HUD-free ""Chill"" mode to watch the fishies swim about.  However, it quickly turns visually ""busy"" as the fish pile up.

The fish behavior AI is simple but good.  Bottomfeeder types tend to stay to the bottom, snails stay on the aquarium floor, and fish species tend to school together.

The soundtrack has soothing guitar tunes.  In a nice touch, an air filter sound runs in the background for added realism.  


[i]Chillquarium[/i] is basically what the title implies, a ""chill"" little aquarium game you can hang out with and watch or check in just once a day.  While there's not much more to it than collecting your fishies, you can make up your own game modes.

I built up my tanks while keeping one of each species and species variant.  You can go faster if you aim to keep as many high-value fish as you can, or just keep selling off every fish until you have every tank unlocked at their highest capacity, and then aim for some final goal of fish collection.

It's also fairly cheap, making it easy to support an indie dev.",1703577739,1703577777,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-For the price I feel that I am not really getting a lot of playtime here.  There isn't really much going on besides buying something and waiting.  There are gold sink systems but none of them are rewarding in the sense of progression.  It just all feels like a waste.  

-You get a tank and buy some fish.  Each fish has some sort of passive income to the tank and gives a large lump sum if sold.  

-You can buy more fish and upgrades to sorted things that increase your ability to buy a larger tank or better fish and that's the end of the upgrade systems.  The rest you waste gold on very few lights and decorations that are simply only there to waste money on.   

-The game has a good selection of fish perhaps 150 or so that you can unlock.  The game will run out of content somewhat quickly, perhaps 30 to 40 hours of content to 100% the game is what I assume.  Maybe a bit quicker.  Assuming you can stand sitting around for that long.

-For the cost of this game the content is lacking for an idle game I feel.

-I wouldn't expect much more to be done based on the update frequency and the radio silence from the developer.  The game needs a lot of additions to provide a smoother, more involved experience for the player.  It feels slow, choppy, unbalanced and quite bland at the moment.

You buy fish through card packs of baby random fish (a gacha system). 
You overfeed your fish because they are never satisfied. 
You wait for them to grow up (either through feeding them for xp, or waiting for real time to pass), then you sell fish to buy more. Sometimes you have to determine if the long term idle money the fish will bring in will be worth more than the short term gain from selling them outright.
Sometimes the fish come in unique colors, or gold, and there is a list in game to show you what kinds of fish you've unlocked.

If you enjoy idle games and collecting, it's worth a try. It's no where near as engaging as something like Insaniquarium (if you're looking at it and expecting them to be similar) but it doesn't take a lot to run so it genuinely can just be a cute and interactive desktop/screensaver sort of scenario.

If you're anything like me and love youtube essays/long videos then you'll enjoy just having this in the background or foreground to stare at. It's cute, it's charming and the fish are so cool! 
I have to say, I found it a bit slow to get started but once the money starts coming in it's very easy to keep the ball rolling.
I am a huge fan of the fact there's a compendium with all the fish, it's a nice and easy way to keep track of what I've seen.
Another thing that I like is that your fish will grow even if the game is closed, so you can also just check back in periodically and have some new friendos.

Very nice thing to have open in the background and check in on whenever I need some form of stimulation. It stops me from checking social media all the time which is nice. I also love the art direction of the fish, they're very cute.

Some things I think would improve the game: 

Adding tank names - I often get confused which tank I'm looking at unless I use decorations. It would be nice to have the ability to name them yourself or something other than a number to differentiate them. Also a back button to clear the name headings from the top right after accidentally fat fingering the swap tanks button.

Having a statistic that will calculate how much money per second or per minute you are making - The counter goes very quickly and it would be a nice QOL update to be able to calculate the rate of money you can afford to splurge on the giant packs at a chance for golds or rainbows at a given time. 

Those are my two big wants which I think would make the most sense and wouldn't be too hard to include in a clicker style game. If anything to resolve that already exists then disregard.

The game isn't perfect and still lacks a lot of features, balancing and polish to keep you playing, but again, it was fun and kept me company while working for a little while. It's one of those games I'll keep and eye on to see if more features are added.

--------------

I've barely scratched the surface, but I'm liking it so far. It is indeed very chill and a good hands off game that I'll keep on the side while I work. I hope the dev adds more QOL features in the future such as better sorting/filtering or a way to exclude baby fish from the ""sell all unlocked fish"" button. I pretty much screwed up my first tank thinking it wasn't selling babies by default.

The one thing I don't like is the feeding. I find it goes against the relaxing spirit of the game as you're at a big disadvantage if you don't actively spam feed your baby fish non stop... quickly found myself compulsively doing it and it wasn't the chill experience I was looking for anymore.

pros:
Its pretty. There are a lot of fish to own. Each fish comes in a standard, painted and golden version.

Cons:
You will see everything you can do in this game within 5 minutes of picking it up. It doesn't change or expand in any way.


I've played many idles games and I would argue this one has by far the least amount of things you can do.
Lets go over what you can do in this game:
You can buy fish out of 5 sets. 2 for freshwater and 3 for salt water.
If you push right click you can directly feed the fish to make em grow faster. You can sell fish for money or keep em alive to gain money over time.
You can upgrade your tank to hold more fish or buy additional fishtanks. Upgrading allows them to hold more fish.
You can buy decorations that serve no purpose other than cluttering up the screen. The fish do not interact with them in anyway.
You can buy new sand types for the floor. But it has no gameplay impact.
You can buy new colored lights but again, no gameplay impact.

And that's it. This is honestly barely a game. You'd be much better off playing nearly any other idler.
I honestly don't understand the overwhelmingly positive reviews at all.

[h3][b][u]Short Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] An idle game that definitely accomplishes its goal of being cozy and relaxing, but it's one that I can only recommend provided you understand what you're getting into first. In truth, it's closer to an interactive screensaver than a traditional idle game, with progression (i.e. collecting the 100+ unique fish species) that's purely dependent on luck and no real metagame to speak of. Though I still enjoyed it, players that want a more hands-on experience may want to look elsewhere.

[h3][b][u]Long Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] [i]Chillquarium[/i] is an idle game about buying, raising, and selling all manner of fish big and small in your own personal aquarium. You'll start with common pet store finds like goldfish and bettas, using the funds from their sales to purchase larger wild-caught species like panfish, carp, and trout. Eventually, you'll migrate to saltwater fish with the same progression towards bigger and bigger species, pushing the limits of what can reasonably be called an ""aquarium fish"" until you're suddenly sitting on a tank that's inexplicably filled with dozens of deep sea fish and several types of shark. Silliness aside, it's a more relaxed game that it might sound, sometimes to its own detriment.

Buying fish in this game is kind of like buying trading cards: there are five themed sets (e.g. small river fish, tropical reef fish) with 25 different species in each; and you can buy them in packs that give you four random fish from the set you chose. They start out as babies and need to grow into adults before selling them will turn a profit, and the growth period for each baby fish can last anywhere from five minutes to an entire week in real-time depending on the species. You can either ride out the timer (which still ticks down when the game is off, thankfully) or speed things up by feeding them food pellets, which increases their growth meter by a few points per pellet and can be continuously dropped into a tank for as long as you're willing to hold down the mouse button. Once a fish is fully grown, you can sell it off for significantly more than what you paid for it, allowing you to purchase more expensive fish packs, new tanks to increase your space, better fish food to increase the growth gain per pellet, and a wide variety of cosmetics to decorate your tanks.

Beyond that, there's a collection aspect to the game that you can pursue, which is the only actual goal [i]Chillquarium[/i] will gently push you to work towards. There are 125 unique fish to find as of writing, with separate achievements for netting all 25 species from each of the 5 sets. In true trading card-like fashion, every fish also has an uncommon painted (alternate color) variant and a rare golden variant that can sometimes appear in a pack, both of which are tied to separate achievements for their collection. If you're the completionist type, be warned that [b]how fast you can find new species and earn achievements is entirely based on luck[/b] since they can only be found in these random bundles—there's no metagame or strategy involved, and there are no shortcuts that don't involve manipulating your save file.

And...that's about it, really. Sure, the fish variety goes up along with the size of your bank account over time, but the gameplay itself never evolves—what you're doing for the first 20 minutes is exactly what you'll be doing in the next 20 hours. [b]It's very hands-off even for an idler, and it almost feels more like a customizable screensaver than a video game at times.[/b] Heck, there's even a ""Chill Mode"" to drive the point home, which hides the UI so you can put the game in full screen and pretend you've still got that aquarium screensaver that used to come with older versions of Windows. As a side note, if you do plan on leaving the game running for extended periods of time, I strongly recommend turning on the newly-added ""Sparse Music"" option in the settings as soon as you can. It's not because the music is bad or anything—quite the opposite, actually—it's because there's only a handful of short tracks in the game, and they get repetitive very quickly when they're all playing in a loop one after the other without a break.

On one hand, I tend to prefer more interaction with my idlers, with mechanics that let me influence and optimize my progression instead of just sitting around and hoping luck is on my side today. On the other hand, it's not like it's trying to tout itself as something more than it is—it markets itself as a ""cozy and relaxing"" idle game, and I'd say it accomplishes that goal just fine. Besides, it's managed to keep me checking in semi-regularly for the past three months, long enough for me to find all 125 fish; though whether I stick around to finish collecting their painted and golden variants is anyone's guess. [b][u]Overall, I'd give [i]Chillquarium[/i] a tentative recommendation: if you want something you can throw onto a second monitor to help you vibe while you work, then this will definitely get the job done; but if you want an idler you can more actively engage with, you're better off looking somewhere else.[/u][/b]

However, the game's progression feels repetitive at times. Some ideas occurred to me while I was playing, but I recognize my vision for the game and the dev's vision are likely quite different. Many people enjoy a slower pace of game, so take everything I say with a pinch of salt. (!!Minor game spoilers ahead!!) 

With that being said, I'd love more substantial upgrades that increase the pace of the game. While the new food upgrades are helpful, they are only minimally so, and do not change the pace of the game significantly, especially toward the late game. A larger diversity of upgrades would add more uses for money, rather than just fish and tanks. For example, a mid-game built in auto-feed mechanic rather than the user tabbing out while holding right click would feel rewarding after manually feeding fish for so long. The passive rate of fish XP essentially become negligible at a certain point, a one-time upgrade to decrease waiting time could be hugely helpful. Some form of quest system that rewards the player for collecting a wide variety of fish would incentivize discovering lower-value fish and buying lower-price packs. The artwork for the game is charming and engaging, and I love when there is more to the encyclopedias in these types of games, such as descriptions or fun facts, but I recognize I'm well in the minority. Finding a balance between too simple and too complicated is tough, and I think it's best to stay on the simpler side, so the game is in a fairly good spot right now. Overall, it is very well-crafted, but I'd love some small additions to give it more life.",1701726103,1701726103,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As far as gameplay goes it is very minimal. Buy fish, feed them to make them grow up, get money, buy more fish, get more money, upgrade stuff, rinse and repeat. What helps with this even more is that fish grow and gain you money even when the game is off, so really you only need to put a few minutes into every day if you are not just trying to get everything as fast as possible. If you are really into it as well there are options to customize your fish tanks as well. Beyond that, there really is not much to this game, but there does not need to be. There is something very Zen about raising fish and decorating the tank, and I am all here for it. Nonetheless, I think that there are some changes that I would like to see. More tank customization would be the first thing I would add for sure though, there just isn’t enough. Hell even if they made it a 99¢ DLC I think that would be fair, much more than that though and they would be pushing it. I also think that there needs to be a way to more effectively fill your tank with fish when you are farming out collecting the fish, and the option to buy the maximum fish allowed would save me a bunch of time and save my mouse from 1000 unnecessary clicks. I also think that there should be a purchase that would increase your odds of getting painted or golden fish. If you put it late enough then you really aren’t harming the game either, you do not need to try to keep me as long as possible, I bought the game, don’t make me gamble 8000 times just to get golden fish, it is tedious and actually harms the game in my opinion. In all fairness though, even without those quality-of-life additions I think that the game is just fine, I do not need to min-max fish purchases, but for an achievement hunter like me, I do not appreciate how luck-based it is to get these achievements in a reasonably timed manner, but it is not like this game is hardcore or anything, so I digress.

As far as sound design goes it is completely serviceable, but it is limited. Gurgles and drops are about all you will hear beyond the background music. Speaking of the background music it is okay, it is peaceful enough that it fits in, but it does not really excel in any way.

Graphically I think the game is very well done. The pixel art is really solid, and I am always a sucker for that style. What makes it sit above and beyond many other games though is the lighting. The tank lighting can be customized and the way that it changes the look of the game is very appealing, hell I wish there were more of them, I think it is the strongest thing you can customize in the game. Overall, I think the pixel art was a good choice and the lighting excels.

So yeah, Chillquarium is a chill game and is something that I have just been casually putting time into on the side. I think that $6 is very fair if this type of game is something you are interested in, if you are looking for something more active though, I think you will feel a bit cheated. It is not a masterpiece by any means, but it does not need to be. Chillquarium intends to be a chill aquarium game, and it absolutely nails it.",1701143762,1701143762,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There's nothing to do, no reward for active play, no reason to keep the game open, basically no upgrades, no quests aside from the tutorial, and no story. 
You can feed your fish to make them grow faster, but the EXP this gives the fish is so minuscule it's not worth it. Also, the adult fish (which can't grow any more and just give passive income) mob your cursor for the food only baby fish can eat. 
As a simulation/desktop tank it's not great either. The fish swim around, but they don't seem to have different behaviours besides the snails, which are slow and stay on the bottom. The decorations are also very expensive so you won't be able to do any customisation for weeks of real time.

It's not really a 'game' beyond some very barebones mechanics of buying 'card packs' of fish and then watching your income go up by virtue of fish somehow generating.... income? It all is very silly and makes basically zero sense but at the same time adds some goals to faff about with.

I'd love if there was more to the game, but at the same time I think this minimalist stuff is what the game was also meant to be, so again, it's 'fine for what it is'.

I recommend it with the caveat that you go in knowing it's little more than an engaging screensaver.

Anyways, I've been checking in almost every single morning (since getting the game), and it's satisfying watching that in-game currency roll in, and faster so. Buy fish, sell fish once grown to full size (or keep them so that they generate money over time), buy cosmetics and more/better fish, rinse and repeat.

Once I've purchased all cosmetics (lights, pebbles and decorations) and seen all fish, I'll give this game a wrap (so no 100% achievements for me) since by then it's probably overstayed its welcome.

Perhaps I just don't ""get it"", but this game is incredibly boring. You hold down the right mouse button to feed fish and wait for a fish to grow into an adult fish, then sell the adult fish for money to buy more fish. And...that's it.

I guess later on you can buy different kinds of fish and decorate your tank a bit, but there should be some actual game play, otherwise this is just a virtual fish tank decorating game.

So basically the game play consists of holding down the right mouse button.

I know idler games typically don't have too much game play, but even by idler standards this is just very lacking. No story, no mechanics like buying something to help you feed the fish, no busywork side tasks like cleaning the fish tank or anything, no hunger meters for the fish to keep track of.

The different unlocks always feel really satisfying once you get them, and you really can just get absorbed in watching them all swim about. They recently also made it so the little fish move faster, so getting them to grow with the fish food is much easier now if you want to play actively. The sprites all look really nice, cool mix and style of smoothed out pixel art.

If i could say any complaint, it'd probably just be that once you unlock the newer fish for a tank, its not really profitable or worth it buying the older ones. Having a system where you could buff how much the older fish get you after you get far enough would be nice to increase tank variety.

Its an alright game. Its not amazing, its not boring. Its an idle screensaver with the intention to be something you check in on occasionally. People expecting it to do more are detrimental to what it is currently achieving. I say less is better.

What I consider completion is buying everything available to buy. It does not include getting all achievements, more on that shortly.
The game is fun whilst you have targets to aim for, such as increasing your daily income, getting the next tank or increasing your tank size, but it lacks depth after that. I also don't see any replay value, I've uninstalled it now and I don't expect to return to it unless there are more stages added, more fish etc... There's nothing else I can do, no other way to play it.

[b]What are the achievements I have left?[/b] 
I completed 7/15 achievements, the rest of the achievements are much the same, buy fish, hope you get a painted or gold, sell, repeat. There isn't anything there to keep me interested.

[b]So why positive?[/b] 
Because it is fun for 26.5 hours, seeing your daily profits grow, see each new fish come in and the benefit that it brings in terms of revenue. I remember thinking that I was bringing in 100k a day and how pleased I was, if I load up the game now, I'm bringing in something like 17 trillion a day. There is a real sense of progression for a short time.

Now that being said, if DLC was released, I [b]wouldn't[/b] buy it. I don't think there's enough content in the game yet to warrant issuing a DLC. It would feel a bit cheap, but that's for each person to decide.

So yes, it's a positive review overall because of the price, do I have my monies worth? Yeah, I think so, it certainly wasn't expensive. It just seemed really quick. There were times I left the game running in the background accidentally so it could probably be completed in much less time.

In summary, if you have £5 to spare and want something to check out, it's worth it. Just don't expect to sink a  lot of time into it.

Starting with the cons...
- There are only enough tanks to store one of each fish. For collectors, they'll have to sell some fish they might rather keep to make room for rarer ones, and even then there probably won't be space enough left for your dream tank. It would be simple enough to add another fresh and salt tank in the future, or even make it so you can store one of each kind and color of fish. 
- There is currently only one music track, though this honestly isn't a huge issue. The music is nice, and the default setting has it come in and out over time, so it shouldn't get irritating too quickly. 
- Progression tends to feel a little weird. This might be fixed by now but sometimes getting a new set of fish doesn't really spring you forward like you'd think you would and in one instance I almost felt like I skipped one.
- The odds on some of the drops are kind of horrible? I got stuck trying to get the gold discus for about a week and then mopped up the other golds in three days, only having trouble getting the painted giants. I feel like a pity system that puts a little lean on getting unobtained fish would be a really good idea. 
- There's a bit of a lack of decor atm, though I think this will change in the future so won't comment on it much. Instead I'll suggest skull decor. Or how about a no fishing sign? More plants?

That's about all I can think of for negatives, now for the positives. 
- The art is very cute, and the entire thing is incredibly aesthetic. For idlers, the bubbling and adjustable light settings are great. This is basically a gachapon screensaver maker and due to a lack of in game purchases that's a good thing.
- The game is very inexpensive, with a modest six dollar asking price.
- The mechanic of obtaining and selling fish can definitely be rewarding, and the fish move like they ought to in life which is nice, with halibut and flounder dwelling on the bottom and tetras schooling.
- There is generally a good selection of lights and soil colors, letting you go for whatever kind of aesthetic you'd like, from understated to gaudy. 
- Your fish don't require any care, so you don't have to worry about making sure they don't die. For a game like this, that's a good thing. 

That's about all I have for positives, but, in a way, that's all this game needs. It's not perfect, and I hazard to call it exceptional, but it's a damn solid idler for people who like fish but don't want to worry about them dying. 3/5, good game and exceptionally worth its asking price.",1699981731,1699981731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Good
- loads of types of fish + upgrades to earn
- lots of variants + pretty fish to look at
- upgrade system seems to be scaled pretty well (it took me about a week using 10-15 minutes daily to earn my first saltwater fish, at 200k)

The Meh
- If you're like me and you want to collect all the rainbow + golden fish, it's ... a slog. I think you could keep the spawn rates of these the same - the annoying part is having to click and add baby fish to my tank just to sell them immediately. If you're going to buying thousands of fish to get all the golds / rainbows, then maybe streamline the process so it involves less clicking. 
- I'm personally not a huge fan of the tank decorations. I wish we could change their overall size.",1699408190,1699408190,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is exactly what it says it is but also doesn't do anything new, fun, or unique.
The fish are all the same with shiny/gold/rainbow color variations.
There's no unique behaviors, minimal tank customization, even the variants of some fish aren't all that appealing.
When you get to the point that money is meaningless you're essentially launching the game to open card packs for hours.
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of cards just to try and get that last gold fish you need for achievements.
And if you wanted to setup and decorate multiple themed tanks there just aren't enough tanks to even find that fun.

A cute idle that's worth a couple dollars, especially on sale.
But would be greatly improved with
-better variations/skins for the fish
-unique fish behaviors 
-more decorations and customization options
-maybe a lil' bad luck prevention
-OPEN ALL option for fish cards, I'm getting carpal tunnel my dude.*

- please allow us to change the light intensity (or color opacity) in each tank! the cool blue lights in particular are really overwhelming and make the tank look super dark. i'd like to be able to tweak the intensity of the colored lights. (this has been changed since my review!! i doubt it was bc of my suggestion, since it happened overnight, but thank you!!)
- it would be really nice to have an option to auto-lock new fish! idk if this makes things too ""easy"" (for lack of a better term) by taking some of the legwork out of collecting, but i thought it merited suggesting!
- similarly, the option to auto-lock specific fish (maybe through the fish encyclopedia?) would be nice as well, but again, idk if this fits into your vision in terms of work/automation balance.
- these two are ostensibly a lot more work on your end, but still seem possible for future expansion of the game: blurbs in the fish encyclopedia to teach us about the fish (could even just be a little trivia fact for each one), and unique animations for all or rare fish (really i just want the pufferfish to puff tbh). maybe even just unique animations in the encyclopedia vs live in the tank.
- more tank decor options in general, but specifically maybe floating decor at the top of the tank? also idk but i feel the tank decor price curve is a little steep? maybe i'm just playing slowly tho!

overall it's an incredible game and i am super glad i bought it, i would buy it ten more times (i'm gonna buy it for any of my friends who will let me). thank you!!",1697510080,1697576538,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Chillquarium is exactly what you'd think. An aquarium idle game with a little bit of RNG thrown into the mix. The game-play is simple. You buy fish, and let them grow. If you want them to grow faster, you can feed them. Eventually they will become adults. You can either sell them, or let them earn passive money for you by simply existing. As you gain more money you can buy bigger/better fish, pebbles, lighting, and decorations. You get ""packs"" of fish and and sometimes you get rare/epic/legendary fish in those packs.

So what's the appeal then? Well the first fun thing to do is to try and get bigger, better, and rarer fish. (Gotta collect 'em all!) As you get farther in the game it's relaxing to just watch fish swim around. There were days I would just leave this running on one of my monitors and check on it every once in a while.

I could see this game being used as a fun backdrop for a business. Don't want to pay for an aquarium and maintenance? Just leave a computer on running this in the background for people to watch in a waiting room or something.

While the game is good as is, below are some things that would be cool to see in the game:
- More animations for the fish to feel more ""alive"". For example moving their fins.
- More decorations
- Decorations should move. For example the chest that opens/closes. A diver moving up and down.
- More interaction with the decorations. For example having the fish go behind them, hide in them, etc.
- Able to change the background. The only option right now is a wavy background. It would be nice to have different pictures.
- More ""stuff"" like maybe adding a filter to make it look more real.
- Maybe fish can have babies?
- More sounds like more bubbles, filter, splashing sounds
- An option to replace the textures with more lifelike ones (Ability to mod the game?)
- Huge tanks/pools to hold huge fish like humpback whales, orcas, dolphins, etc.
- Creatures that crawl on the ground able to move in every direction, rather than just horizontal.

I have essentially beat the game, I have gotten every regular and painted fish from every pack. The only achievements I am missing are the golden fish. It was a great experience all around.

The only issue I had with the game on launch was that there were no food upgrades, but the developer added that recently, so I can't even complain about that.

I think getting all of the painted's isn't too hard if you're willing to put in the effort, since it took me 24 hours and that was before the food upgrade, so it is likely shorter now.

However, after you get into it a little bit and start earning enough income to get more fish at a time, it becomes incredibly fun and rewarding!! I love how fun and flexible it all is! You can play to collect fish, simply to raise fish, to have a themed tank (such as a red tank, a golden tank, etc. as shown in the example video), to have one of each kind of fish, or to have a school made entirely of one kind of fish! There's just no limits here! 

My biggest complaint is the price of saltwater fish. I had to save up enough for the saltwater tank, and then let it sit empty until I could afford my first pack of saltwater fish. This hasn't happened with my other tanks as it's usually pretty balanced.

I also wish that when viewing fish in one tank, it put the locked fish at the top of the list for all fish of that kind. For example, if I have 5 goldfish all the same color/income/everything, sometimes the locked fish will be listed in the middle of those 5 instead of at the top (or bottom). I just want the locked fish to show some sort of priority compared to non-locked fish of the same type. I personally do this because I want to keep one of each kind of fish in the tank to have some diversity, but I need to manually scroll through to make sure I have one of each type locked. Having a setting to keep one of each type locked would be nice as well. It's not a big deal, and sometimes it's actually relaxing to go through each fish manually, but considering that I do this every time I want to buy new fish it can get repetitive if I play a lot in one day.",1697135069,1697135069,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

On top of that, adult fish no longer eat feed, which means all the exp from food goes to the baby fish that can actually use it.

Great changes! Thank you for listening to your community!

Some additional changes that I suggest:
* Once you have unlocked all the common fish of a particular pack, increase odds to get the painted fish of the same type. Then, once the player has all of the painted fish unlocked, increase odds for golden fish to appear. I guess this is similar to the shiny charm in Pokemon.

* Add mass pack buying option. I'm trying to get all the golden fish for each pack (starting with the first). I'm doing this by emptying out an aquarium then buying 25 packs and opening all of them. If I don't get anything I need, sell all and repeat. The one issue is that I feel I'm getting RSI from clicking 25 times each time. Maybe add an option to specify the number of packs you buy (e.g. 5, 10, 25)

* And finally, and FPS limiter. This game is beautiful, don't get me wrong, but I don't need it running at 144fps on my laptop

The food you feed them to make them grow faster doesn't scale with the more expensive fish which can be really annoying when the second pack common fish take like, 2 days to mature (don't even get me started on some of the others). HOWEVER, that's kind of the point. I actually really like that this game forces you to have slow progression. It means that you can't get everything within a day and never open the game again. Just a fair warning the price gouging for the fish feels really unfair but again, I like this aspect. It forces you to buy fish of one tier a lot and see more and more of those fish before just moving on to the next one and overwhelming you trying to get all the different versions. Every big purchase of this game feels more earned since you literally had to wait for it (and for your fish to make money for you). If you're a perfectionist with games like this you might hate the RNG for the Goldens but hey, that's why they're rare. I love the art of this game but I do wish the background had a little more going on (or at least let me buy stuff for the background it's pretty boring). Overall this is one of the better Idle games I've played as it's actually an Idle game that still lets you control everything without overwhelming you or taking up too much time when checking up on it.

I do wish there was a way to increase the amount of exp that fish food would give-however seeing as it's intentionally meant to be a relaxed idle game, I imagine that's by design. The 24h cap on idle income also seems a bit strange, especially seeing how monstrous the prices get-but I imagine the later fish are worth alot more so it evens out.

Definitely recommend for anyone who likes idles and doesn't want to feel pressured to min-max their time in it!

Is chill, is quarium, am happy.

Yes, I have 160 hours in it, but only because I spend 30-60 minutes buying fish then cheesily leave it tabbed out auto-feeding babies while I work.

My only gripe with the game is that I would absolutely love a way to streamline the process of gold hunting. As a bit of an achievement hunter it irks me that I'd need to spend hours upon hours, even using an auto-clicker, to buy pack after pack and sift through them all to get the golden beauties I want. Please give us some menu streamlining Developer-man Ben! Maybe a buying mode that auto sells fish below a certain rank or colour level? Or more expensive fish packs with higher chances for rarer colours?

And that's basically true, but I think rating it down for that is unfair - that's what the game says it is, it's what it says on the tin.  That's like rating down a shooter for being violent.  This is a chill, idle aquarium-based creature collector.  If that's what you like, then this is a nice game for you.  If not, then don't get it.

If I have any caveats, they're mostly things other folks mentioned: the increment scaling is off - it takes 3 real weeks to get enough fish to make the cash to get a second fish tank and start the second batch of fish.
It would be nice if there were more tank animations - bubbles occasionally, or pond/seaweed that waves back and forth, that sort of thing.  And there should be advanced fish packs for more money that have increased chances of painted/golden fish.

But for the cheap, sub $5 price, this is a nice, laid-back, relaxing RNG creature collector.",1696439907,1696439907,True,78,0,0.855831265449523926,0,True,False,False

i do also recommend waiting a bit until the food and decoration system gets a rework, but make sure to keep this game on your wish list
the art style is cute and simple, although i wish fish had multiple painted patterns, like an alternate painted or a painted random
painted (the text) is colored orange in game, so maybe there could be painted red - purple 

i recommend treating this game more as a literal aquarium (or background subway surfer replacement game play for fish enthusiasts) than an actual game (i.e. farming for rare colors/maxing money)
me personally, i keep a tank specifically for types of fish i just like despite low rarity or common patterns :D

I bought this after seeing the 1.0 release on my front page. The game itself is *incredibly* bare bones - I understand that it is going for the cute, cosy, 'just vibes' type of game; but there really isn't much game at all even for that. Fish growth times are initially long and only grow longer (the middle tier of the penultimate fish type taking close to a week to mature). There is no way to upgrade how much the food pellets take off of each fish's timer, and their AI often causes lag if you have the full tank swimming around your held-down mouse (on a 4070Ti).

The different colour-rarities of fish is a unique mechanic that I like. However, the percentage chance to get them is far too low, especially since collecting all of them for each tier is tied to all of the games achievements. I'm certain that they've been unlocked using SAM, as I do not believe the percentage of people having sat there holding an auto-clicker buying, opening, and mass selling fish for what I would estimate to be days at a time for *each* tier, let alone the time it would take to accrue the money required to do it for the higher tier fish.

Overall, this is either an alpha build of a very good idle game, or its a screensaver that you need to have open and actively click on occasionally to get the cool effects on. Good potential, but not worth it unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket.",1696004465,1696004465,False,1,0,0.45378151535987854,0,True,False,False

I really do enjoy it, the fish are cute.
It is however, extremely slow paced. It takes a very long time for most of the fish to mature, and accumulating money to upgrade and move on to new fish types is a very long process. I've put in daily dedication to this game and JUST started being able to afford saltwater fish.
I'm perfectly fine with that level of progression, I also really like that every fish has a painted and a golden variation, it tickles my collector brain.
One thing that I do find VASTLY lacking however is the sad few options for tank decor. With just over half a dozen sculptures. I would love to see an update in the future with an addition of plants, seashells, and other fun varieties of tank decor. It's very boring having all my hard earned tanks looking identical!

We're all hooked!  The fact that this game is around 5 bucks and has no in-game transactions is impressive as well.  It's 100% worth it for the hours of fun you'll have...and don't worry about overfeeding your fishy friends, as there's no nitrogen cycle in Chillquarium. :) 

Although I adore the game, there are a few requests I'd make for future updates.  An option to tick the music on a continuous loop instead of random bursts of relaxing tunes would be appreciated.  I'd also love a cloud save feature so I didn't have to have two separate Chillquarium games for my two PCs.  Finally, a few more options within settings (such as FPS and graphics) would be nice.

This game is well-designed and hits just the right balance between giving me enough to do and not being too overwhelming.

You buy fish in randomized packs that cost some amount of in-game currency. The fish start out as baby fish and after some amount of time based on their rarity they become adult fish that earn a certain amount of in-game currency per day. You can always sell adult fish for more more than the original cost of the pack, so you never really have any risk of losing money. Feeding the fish by right-clicking makes them grow faster. If you close the game, the fish continue to earn money until the next time you open the game. Over time you earn more money per day and sell enough fish to reach the cost of the next level of pack, which then gives a big spike in potential money. You can also spend money on cosmetic upgrades and additional tanks that hold more fish.

The gameplay is very simple and that's a good thing, you can leave it running all the time and only actually interact with it a few times a day. Beyond that, the visuals of the game acts like an animated desktop background and help actually feel like a benefit of collecting fish and making upgrades. The fish designs are cute and it's easy to pick favorites and name them. It does not feel at all like a mobile game with a brutal or confusing in-game economy, you can rush to grow and sell fish as quickly as possible or take your time and have a more relaxed pace. There's enough to do in the game that you can play it for weeks and still have new things to collect or unlock.",1695765115,1695765115,True,7,0,0.580811202526092529,0,True,False,False

Reminds me of when I was a kid playing fish tank tycoon games on Mini-clip and other website based game sites. The progression speed is pretty slow, I know it's a game to not overtly grind on but, the game could do with something to speed up the feeding rate or something. I'm basically waiting minutes on end for fish to grow only to sell for barely any money. Another thing, money; you don't get a lot and there is too slow of a multiplier and the shop is ludicrously expensive to progress. It feels like there could be quality of life changes to help the game tease you to play more like cookie clicker. As it is this game feels very tedious and cheap for five dollars; almost like a book at the airport news stand that you buy but never read again after you've gotten home.

Edit: The more I have played the more I have come to appreciate the deviation in the genre. I actually like the batch ""growing and selling aspect"" and feel like this game is unique from the other cookie clicker esque games out there. I'm still playing it so there's that.

So I went looking to see if there were any interesting idle games. This was the second result in the Idlers tag. I already like aquariums and fish so I downloaded the demo and played for about 10 mins before purchasing the full game. It is a very good use of $6.

I like that this game forces you to be patient. One of the biggest annoyances for me these days is the obsession with ""min maxing"" and ""racing"" to complete everything in a game first. This game has no micro transactions or anything like that. If you get a rare fish you are waiting the 3 days for it to grow up. The upgrades appear at first to have ridiculous pricing, but you will notice the more rare fish you get, the more income they draw in cumulatively over time. So there is the satisfaction of checking the game before and after work, before and after you go to bed/ wake up, to see what has changed/ that number slowly beginning to tick up faster. 

It is the perfect game for someone who wants to ""play a game"" but doesn't have 300 hours to set aside. Seriously, I purchased BG3 and recently re downloaded Destiny 2 and this game has held my attention more than either of those, and I've probably only spent an hour total actually looking at it. 

It has lovely artwork, with many different kinds of fish in it (And I havent even scratched the surface yet, I've still only seen the freshwater stuff). It has small but satisfying little sound effects.

I personally like an idle game that isn´t making me crash mentally after an hour because of extreme sensory overload, but still makes you wanna chase after upgrades, Chillquarium does exactly this for me and it´s a wonderful break from the world in these trying times. Thanks to the dev for adding small details such as the light actually being timed to real time and piranas moving around in a groupe like they do in reallity most of the time, and i mean, the SNAILs and Axelotles are just things that should make anyone feel happy, these subtle things show to me that it´s made with a touch of love and care <3 Ps.

As other reviews mention, it's a chill fish game. If that's all it tried to be, I wouldn't complain. I picked this up while I was sick and it was a nice low effort game to pass the week, I feel bad complaining but it's where I'm at. None of this is personal against the dev; keep up the good work and good luck in school.

The game has several variants of each fish, each rarer than the last. Painted and Golden variants both give achievements for collecting all of them from a set. Even if you have this game in the background for months on end, I think you'll eventually decide to try and grind out the achievements with your infinite amounts of money. 

I've spent somewhere between 2 and 4 hours JUST opening packs from the first set for goldens, and I'm still missing one golden legendary, and there's still 4 other sets of packs after that. I earn enough money to buy thousands of these packs per second, but can only buy 25 at a time before I have to clear them out of my tank. The game needs at minimum a UI upgrade for churning through packs like this, but preferably a system to increase the odds so you don't need to buy and sell so many fish to find rare variants. It can cost unreasonable amounts of money, it just needs to save time. The current methods of grinding don't fit well with the otherwise low effort gameplay; it's very not chill.

If that grind gets fixed, I think it'll be back to a chill little fish game.",1695361886,1695362000,False,1,0,0.526315808296203613,0,True,False,False

I usually don't play long because it is hard to make progress while just sitting there so I usually check every morning and night to sell all my duplicates and commons. I think the progress is slow when getting to a new tier but what I do is I buy my first new set of fish and if it isn't epic, legendary, painted, or gold then I sell it once it has grown because it gives me access to a good amount of money very early and I only need about two or three sets before I can start buying a lot more. I also just got a rainbow gold fish while going back to get my last two painted epics I never got so that's cool that there is a secret (not anymore) tier of fish. It's also cool because I only have three golden fish and now I already have a rainbow. But yeah I'd say this game is definitely worth it and I can't wait for them to add more fish and new things.

on another point some fish literally take days to grow, some take hours, and some take minutes. if you are expecting a high octain fish hatchery than you are at the wrong location only chill no stress game play. and not one moment are you pressured to progress or do anything, you could just sit with the base tank of 60 fish and just watch them swim. the getting new fish and growing your tank feels kinda secondary like just a thing for you to do like a never ending side quest that only really ends when you want it too or i guess till you fill out the fish dex its one of those games where you can either experience the whole game in 1 hour or a few hundred (probably thousands if i'm being real) its your own little fishy journey and the fish will always be there in the chillquarium, chilling.

PS (if you really just want to grow your fish fastly you can just use auto clicker, but your fish don't make and aren't worth a more than if you grew them naturally)

I would also be over the moon if there were stats on how many of each fish you sold, how much money you've spent/made.
And just throwing this idea out there- an individual leveling system (sort of like Farm Together) for each fish. The higher you level up a fish; the more money it makes. You'd obviously have to scale down how much they make you to begin with but again, just an idea!

You don't really get much from actually ""playing"" the game, it's more of a login, sell some fish, buy some booster packs and log out kind of deal. You don't really get much progress from feeding the fish, it's not really worth doing.

I purchased this game for $5 on sale and I feel like I stole it, the amount of passion that must have gone into the creation of this game is outstanding. I've almost completed Rivers and Ponds, but I can already tell that the attention to detail for each fish will continue to impress me. I adore the painted versions as they bring a great amount of variety to the fish. Golden versions are also super fun to collect, and the other secret rarity that I've just discovered. 

My biggest surprise was finding out there are no micro transactions, and to that I give a very large applause, it would be so easy to just stick in ""extra tank, $15usd"" but not doing so shows a great amount of integrity, and as a player I feel good just playing the game. many pay-to-win style games make free-to-play players subconsciously feel not as invested. 

My only suggestions would be that I feel the current selection of fish (while amazing and already vast) could definitely be expanded upon to include other types of aquatic life! The addition of aquatic plants would be fantastic as a secondary way to decorate or even gain more passive income. 

Again, I have only seen about 35% of the fish in the game so I may update my review later on talking about potential new fish, but currently I am more than satisfied with my purchase of this game and I hope that it gets even more support so that updates, DLC, and even potential merch could be available in the future.

Even for an idle game it feels way too slow and the balancing feels off (the epic fish that matured in 2 days makes less than the epic fish that matured in 1 day). Fish only make money once a day, reducing your main income to selling your fish. There's no meaningful interaction other than holding right click to feed and even that is really only good for growing the fish that take minutes to mature. Trying to feed to boost the hours or days fish feels awful. No upgrades other than more tank space and more tanks. It's something you check on every few hours while you do something else.

There's not much to do because this game is still what I would consider in its infancy. There is a cheese strat where you can auto-feed your fish, so that helps progress a ton currently. Hopefully future updates bring an auto-feed system or something similar. So far progress seems reasonable, and the game seems like it has a lot of potential with a lot of future possibility. There is no microtransaction system, which is great, and hopefully it stays like that. It even goes as far as feeding a ""gacha itch"" with in-game currency, since obtaining fish is based on a gacha system that gives you a chance at rarer fish that bring more income to buy more packs and pull for more fish. $6 might be a bit steep, but the developer was generous enough to have the game on sale for release week. In the future, there will hopefully be enough content added to fill the $6 worth of this game. Based on seeing the interaction of the developer with this game also, you can tell they love the game and love to create for it. They seem to do a lot of brainstorming and listen to player feedback, which is pretty rare for a lot of game developers these days. All in all, I look forward to what this game may bring in the future. I would love to see more systems like auto-feeding, maybe feed upgrades, more tiers of different fish to fill the gaps of how far between the current price of fish are, etc. But I mean, for the $5 this game currently is? It's definitely worth giving a shot if you haven't yet. If anything, it's relaxing and cute and a nice background on a 2nd monitor.

Edit: This game does become somewhat active when you begin filling your fish pokedex. Getting the golden set for the first pack of fish alone took me 6 hours of nonstop play. While it's not much for active play, it's definitely a grind and a half. I was stuck on 23/25 fish for 5 out of 6 of those hours until I figured out growing up the gold babies I already have increases my chances of getting new goldens. As soon as I grew the babies, I got the Koi instantly which was one of the 2 I was missing.

Achievement hunters may appreciate this game as another perfect game in their collection but beware; no Steam Cloud and no Trading Cards! Those looking for a more in-depth experience can look to Insaniquarium Deluxe which costs less than this game but lacks achievements.

I really like it but there are definitley some improvements that need to be made regarding the UI. It also really needs an autoclick for feeding with the mouse so you don't have to sit there holding the button. 

Let me explain what exactly this game is.. It's an idler. There's no real goal. You buy fish, they grow, you get better fish. There's no alien attacks or anything like that. This is not Insaniquarium or Feeding Frenzy. The progression is very slow. The slowest I've ever seen in any game. The game progresses when it is closed thankfully, so you don't need to have it opened 24/7. 

There are 5 tiers of fish. Those for $5, $1000, $200,000, $40,000,000, and $8,000,000,000. Each one of these tiers contain A LOT of different fish. There's a bunch of different ones to look at. You can name your fish and customize your tank as well!

You earn money very slowly at the start. I got the game yesterday and right now I have just $500. I've been very good at keeping up with it as well,  

Ultimately, if you get bored very easily then this is not for you. This game is a chore, and that's why it's fine. It's not for everyone. If you liked Neopets type games as a kid then you will absolutely love this.",1694417591,1694507107,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While I enjoy the game and premise, as many other negative reviews have stated there just isn't simply enough here to justify paying for it, at least until the developer expands on the gameplay loop as he has stated in todays small hot-fix/update. 

It's a nice game in the sense that, I can easily pick it up and drop it when I need to attend other events, but on days where I want to sit down and play something for more than a few minutes, this just isn't an option. 


I'm hoping that in the future with updates that the overall amount of things to do besides watch fish swim and eat food increases. At the moment, I feel there is no reason to grind the game besides seeing your encyclopedia slowly fill itself in.

I enjoy this game, but there isn't enough to do.

There seems to be a lack of imagination for how to make the progression interesting or the fish simulation realistic. How about a way to make the food stronger, make the tank encourage a faster rate of fish growth per decoration item, a way to increase/decrease salinity, turbidity, acidity, temperature, etc. to accommodate fish types, have multiple tanks displayed on a wall of fish tanks you can move around to see your full collection at once, a breeding system to automate fish production so you can micromanage male/female fish of each type and their habitats to increase breeding rate, idk just something to make it more of a game.

In my country this game is almost $10 after tax at full price; almost [b]double[/b] the cost compared to games like Cookie Clicker & Melvor Idle. I understand this game is made by one person but, in my opinion, Chillquarium is being priced at an unreasonable level for what the game offers. 

The gameplay loop is very simple and extremely linear (which I like but some might not): Buy packs of baby fish, put them in the tank, wait for them to mature, sell them to buy BETTER packs of BETTER baby fish.

Very simple premise, the graphics are surprisingly interesting to look at for pixel art, and it looks great as a screensaver on my 2nd monitor. Unfortunately, [b]as I’ve hopefully made clear[/b], the price point is pretty high for what Chillquarium offers in terms of gameplay. If you’re looking for an interactive fish-themed wallpaper, just use wallpaper engine [i](which is ironically cheaper than this game)[/i]. 

[b]My honest recommendation[/b], for now, is to play the DEMO. If it’s a [i]low-interactive aquarium screensaver[/i] you’re looking for, the demo offers it for FREE and does not expire (just blocks off some of the types of fish you can buy). Therefore, I am refunding the product at the price point it's currently at. I will 100% be wishlisting this item; [b]but it’s an unjustifiable cost-to-value ratio for an idle game of this caliber[/b]. 

I have thousands of hours in idle games and have fully 100% completed many on steam (screenshot of a couple: https://gyazo.com/139c908a00c0bc60985b2ba0c4150d33). This means I've [b]paid[/b] for many idle games, as well as tried free ones. If I was to price this game off my experience [i]considering it’s an indie studio, content level, progression, etc[/i]… my fair market value estimate would be around $2 USD. If there’s a sale that drops it around that price, I will happily pick it up again.

The first packs cost $5, but then the price skyrockets to $1,000 for the next one. Considering that many of the fish are sold for a mere $2-$4, this turns the game into a idle grind. I managed to unlock all the fish in the $5 packs before I even had half the money I needed for the next pack. It would have been far better to have more fish packs with different rarity percentages, to create a sense of progression.

There are other items available for purchase, such as pebbles, lights, and decorations. Unfortunately, these items serve no purpose in the game except to drain your finances, and they don't contribute anything visually engaging.

The only interaction available in the game is right-clicking to feed the fish, which provides them with a measly +5 experience points. Given that many fish require well over 100,000 points to grow, this +5 boost is inconsequential. One would expect that purchasing accessories might increase this bonus, for people that want a bit more active play, but sadly, that's not the case.

Regarding the idea of having the game run in the background for relaxation, it falls short on this front as well. The music is ok but the effects are grating with no real control over this, and the graphics appear distorted with the fish just bouncing back and forth and does not feel natural nor do they school. There is also no attention to scaling. Oscar, neon tetra, goldfish—they all look essentially the same size.

While you can lock fish you don't want to sell, that's about the extent of it. There is no control if you want to collect golden  or rainbow versions of every fish.

That said! I like it. It's nice and chill and watching the fish swim around is kind of peaceful. You can leave it running while you do something else, or just open it up once a day and adjust your fish and then shut it down until you next want to check on it.

There isn't much to it right now, in that there isn't any reason for decorations aside from to decorate, and there isn't any feeding automation (though you don't have to feed you fish if you don't want to). The fish don't have any kind of animation aside from swimming back and forth.

	I know that the title is a little bit rude, after all this game is “supposed” to be a screensaver, right? Chillquarium communicates a vibe of relaxation and idle sensation in its art style and gentle guitar ambiance. However, at the heart of this game is a grossly malicious time waster of half implemented mechanics and what to me reads as developmental neglect or incomplete design. From the music cutting in and out (going silent often for minutes at a time), to the absurd wait times for basic progress in the game’s myriad meters and features, Chillquarium makes me feel anything but chill. Annoyance and frustration at something which feels like it could have respected my extremely limited time on this planet is going to come up a lot during this review. For the price, this is an overly expensive and fiddly screensaver that fails to appreciate your 5 or 6 dollars US. I see potential in this game, but I am driving myself mad with “coulds and shoulds” and it honestly feels like highway banditry at the end of the day. If this game is found to have a Crypto Miner or something attached to it, I wouldn’t be shocked, and yes I am going to level that possibility squarely because I cannot explain its lackadaisical pace of progression and reward without factoring in some kind of rude profit margin.
	Let’s begin at the basics of this game, then once I lay out the systems I will then explain why even cheating at the game with an Autoclicker is a waste of time, and there are far better games that have more interesting in them to explore, even involving fish!

Mechanics Overview:
	In Chillquarium, the objective of the game is to fill your premium, $6 US screensaver environment with fish, and you get a head start on this with a slap on the ass of $20 and a very mobile-style tutorial which tells you to open the shop, purchase 4 packs of fish, and then unbox them into the aquarium. The packs themselves open with some fanfare, showing off different ‘rarities’ of fish and silhouetting unknown fish, naming them as “???” so as to pique your curiosity as to what fish it could be. The fish spawn in as little babies, and swim around randomly using the finest of Motion Tween + Stretch, Skew, and Squish this side of Adobe Flash 2.0. By right-clicking, you can feed your fish using a pellet of fish food that explodes into XP in a radius that’s maybe 150 pixels wide. The radius means you can hit multiple fish at a time and if you hold right-click it will spawn about 10 pellets per second. For your first few fish, you might get lucky and get a few Goldfish which rapidly grow up into adults with food. The fish swim around somewhat haphazardly when you are feeding, attracted like asteroids to the gravity well but often times circling eventually in an asymptotic manner, so feeding your fish to raise their XP and get them to grow into adults is a bit frustrating.
	Like real fish, your digital fish sprites are hard to hit dead-on, and are slippery enough that it takes a pretty active amount of mouse movement to school them together into a ball, so as to raise as many at once with your force-feeding technique. The fish don’t experience hunger or satiation, so you can feed them indefinitely for hours and hours and they will eventually mature into an Adult Fish. An Adult fish once discovered shows off a one-time pop up indicating its name, and every time the box is dismissed by clicking “Awesome”. You can’t really skip this box and it doesn’t pause the game, it instead releases your mouse input, and your ball of fish that you were feeding will typically scatter right after. When fish mature there’s a cute “pop” noise, but this quickly becomes grating due to how many fish you will need to raise so-as to afford new things. Much like a real life aquarium, there is no escape from the demands of capitalism and once turned into adults, your fish will generate an income value per day (at first, less than a dollar of in-game currency per day), and be listed with a sale value that is usually underwhelming. There are 5 tiers of fish and the march from Tier 1 to Tier 3 was very much a waste of my time, so I probably won’t continue towards Tier 5 unless this game gets major updates and revisions.
	Cash-wise, you have the kind of progression of value that resembles many clicker and idler style games. Your first tier of Fish costs $5 per 4x fish, and the immediate second tier of Fish costs $1000! The first fish in the game cap out at sale prices of around $50, so that means raising a lot of fish so you can get your first Tier 2 pack, which again is 4x fish, and again their sale value is a bit shoddy because Tier 3 Fish cost $200,000 per pack of four. Also Tier 3 and up fish are Saltwater Fish, so you also have to purchase a $300,000 Saltwater Fish Tank. Not only are the values absurdly inflated, but the math starts getting kind of hard to even fathom because your progression is in such huge chunks. In Cookie Clicker, for example, your first upgrades are 5 or 10 cookies, and you gradually build up to several thousand and then a million cookie upgrades. The scale of numbers exists, but this game doesn’t make use of it nor does it seem to care about the obvious grind and gulf between your time expenditure and the money you make per fish. You see, I skipped the part where Fish grow naturally, and when you unbox them each Fish has a time listed that they take to grow naturally. The accrual rate of growth is based upon 1 XP per second, and particularly for fish that take days to grow… it tends not to be precise.
	In 1 hour, a fish grows 3600 XP. The most valuable fish in your current Tier will be north of 100k XP each, for example the highest Tier 2 fish is 504,000 XP, which translates to 140 Hours (5.84 days) of natural growth time. You obviously want to shave as much time as possible off of these waits by feeding your fish, and doing so will help as a single hit of fish food will grant 5 XP to all fish in the radius of the explosion. But, here’s the issue: We’re looking at 100,800 hits for that one fish. The quickest to age fish has 900 XP, so it takes 15 minutes (180 hits of food, if you will) to hit Adulthood. By default you can hold right click to spam roughly 10 hits of food per second, which means that a single Goldfish requires about 18 seconds of continuous hitting to mature. This seems fine by itself, but the problem scales rapidly into that 504,000 XP / 100,800 hit fish, and at 10 hits per second, that means the fish takes 168 minutes of continuous right-click and on-target hitting. I’ve fought MMO Raid Bosses solo that take less time to whittle down, you can grind out like 80 levels in World of Warcraft in that time these days. This is a humiliatingly long grind to unlock a single fish, so it is telling that one of the first documented community guides to this game is about strategies to use an Auto-clicker.

How cheating exposes problem:
	For a game to be chill, I don’t want it to feel like it is begging me to give it attention every day, I don’t want all of these literal fish-hook mechanics to be dangled infront of my face. With lots of unlockable fish, random chance lootpacks giving you ‘rare’ fish, and a cost model that means hours and hours and hours of uncomfortable grinding and right-mouse holding, it becomes a question of WHY. Why is this game so eager to make you hurry up and wait, to burn literally over 2 hours of continuous fish feeding action on a single rare fish, when it will simply be sold for less than the immediate next tier’s weak lame common fish!?

tip for auto-feeding bug right now: hold right click and alt+tab out of the game and your mouse will keep feeding without holding the button down. super nice, especially in the left bottom corner so the fish hit the edge of the screen into the food and don't just circle the food.

still needs lots of QOL features like an actual auto-feeding system, faster progression (going from 5$ per fish to 1000$ while your fish make like 40$ max per day is a big jump) and sell options (sell all grown and unlocked fish, sell all fully-grown common/rare fish, etc.). Right now you have to manually sell every single fish which can get a bit annoying with 100+ fish in the tank. would also love a way to upgrade your food for money because +5xp lose a lot of value when fish need like 500K+ experience

Before buying the base game, I had played the demo for about two months and really enjoyed my time with it! I like the gacha aspect of the game without it requiring me to drain my irl bank account, and I still get excited when I pull a rare variant of a fish for the first time. It's also satisfying for me to see my fish collection grow. I like seeing money number and fish number go up. 

I'm hoping that there will be more buyable active upgrades to help speed up fish growth such as increasing how much xp fish get per pellet of food, because as of now, actively feeding your fish is not that helpful when some fish can take days to grow. Also, it would be nice to be able to (slightly) increase your chance of getting x type of fish (e.g. rare, painted, golden) through a buyable upgrade or accomplishing certain tasks.

I think this game has a lot of potential, and I'm excited to see what's next!

There's nothing to do while you wait and some of the fish take a very long time to grow up (6 real life days is the longest I've seen so far) and there isn't anything you can meaningfully do to speed that up. You can feed them but this requires holding down the right mouse button so that's not really viable unless you want to set up an auto-clicker and not use your computer for anything else.

You sell fish once they've grown, or you keep them if their income is good.
With the money you get, you buy new fish via a gacha system.

The fish grow in real time, but you are able to speed up their growth by right-clicking to feed them.
Every fish has two rare color variants, with increased value and income.
Every fish and their rare variants are recorded in your Collection. (Your Pokédex)
You can upgrade your fish tank to hold more fish, you can get multiple fish tanks, and you can buy different lights, decorations, and pebbles (the floor) for your fish tank.

The game has a very non-intrusive atmosphere. The ambiance is nice, and the music is very relaxing. It plays every now and then for a short while, and in my five hours of running the game, I have not once been bothered by it.
I'd even be willing to say this is the most relaxing game I've ever played. There is no stress, no fear of missing out, no annoyances, and there is even a ""night"" mode that turns the light and its ambiance off, if you so wish.
There is also a ""Chill Mode"", which disables the game's UI. Put the game up on a big screen in your room somewhere with this if you want some nice ambiance. :)

If you are going to buy this, just know that it is VERY idle. Since your fish grow in real-time (for the most part), you'll mostly just be having the game open by the side. This is a good thing in my opinion, as I don't think this game is supposed to be ""played"". It just sits there, bringing some nice ambiance, but also being very satisfying when you do occasionally tab into it.

Overall, I'm very happy I decided to buy this.
Give it a shot - it's on sale. :)

And for the dev: My one suggestion would be to add a way to cap the game to 60 FPS, or maybe lower, if someone wants that. It's running in the background 95% of the time, so I don't think it needs to be at 160 FPS all the time!

However, it has a great potential. I posted some suggestions on discord and it seems like the developer is thinking similarly and is not only going to tune the game loop based on the feedback, but also add some QoL and make the collectibles in game more attractive so it's not just visual but has actual impact on the game progress.

Right now, there is a huge gap between active and passive play, something like 4000% difference. It would be great if some mechanic was introduced that would allow automatic feeding with roughly 50% efficiency compared to doing it manually (so active play is still better rewarded). There is even simpler solution - holding right button drops food at 100% rate, while right-clicking once just sets/cancels automatic feeding at clicked location at 50% rate, letting us feed the fish passively and using the mouse somewhere else (making this finally regular idle game).",1694077383,1694077383,True,16,0,0.707834124565124512,0,True,False,False

I absolutely love the aesthetic and variety of fish. I'm not too far into the game so I've only experienced the freshwater fish but I am excited to see all the different fish species and rare varieties to unlock.

I would love to see more realistic behaviours added to this game in the future. I noticed that schooling/shoaling fish tend to keep to their own groups and I thought that was a very cool touch. A few examples:
[*]Bottom dwelling species like Corydoras and Shrimp keeping to the bottom 1/3 of the screen.
[*]More realistic scaling between species, in real life Bala Sharks get up to 12inches long and Bettas around 3-4inches, but in the game adult Bettas seem to be significantly bigger.
[*]More realistic interactions between fish, something like more aggressive species hoarding the food pellets from smaller species.
[*]Speed of different fish, Neon Tetras can swim a lot quicker than Guppies or Goldfish.
[*]An option to disable the +xp text that appears whenever fish eat a pellet.

Not all realism aspects would be feasible to implement, but I am definitely looking forward to continuing the game and any new content that might be added later.",1694026886,1694027483,True,102,1,0.902085721492767334,2,True,False,False

Its a great idle game for those that don't want to be stuck to the screen actively playing an idle game. Very simple game loop: you buy fish and watch them grow. Once they grow they passively earn you money you use to buy more fish. You can speed up the growing process by feeding them. That is it. 

This is a lot slower of a progression than nearly every other idle I've played so be okay with just logging off the game for the day and pick it back up later when you have more to do. Only thing I wish was different about the game was having more than 24 hours of offline progress tracked. Even just 48 hours would be better.

I recommend this game to those that like idle games buy don't have the time to get invested in tons of mechanics, talent trees, or prestige mechanics. Its just a simple ""money goes up slowly"" type of game.",1694020899,1694020945,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's not much actual gameplay to be had, but it definitely scratches the gacha itch as you buy fish packs and watch your fish grow. An idle, gacha type game designed for single player is nice; there's a sort of zen knowing you're not actually in the competitive gacha bum rush to have a better set up than others. Definitely worth the low price if you're into this kind of thing.

I would like to stress again, though, that there's basically no gameplay except selling and opening the fish packs. You can feed and watch the fish rush towards the food, and that's it. There is no breeding, no playing with the fish, no marketplace or anything. It's a gacha simulator combined with a waiting/idle game, and it's pretty perfect for what it is, but it's not for everyone.",1694020428,1694020428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its a great little game where you feed and grow your fish to earn money to spend on more fish, the idleness is great. Id love to see more ways of interacting with your fish (I haven't gotten far so not sure if there is something like this in already) like leveling them up above their adult level, E.g adult level 2, which will just add another layer to getting attached to these lovely creatures. I will be putting a whole lot more time into this game but as it is new I wanted to give my first impressions; this game is great with little fault, the atmosphere and graphics of the fishes are stellar.",1694020290,1694020290,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
