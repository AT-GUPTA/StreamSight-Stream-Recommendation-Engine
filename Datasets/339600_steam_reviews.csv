Every update is made to make 2-3 month old tech obsolete and almost useless, average fleet build time(1 fleet) is around a month and half. 
You need to constantly throw in 5h+ a day to grind most boring gameplay. There is no diversity, just plain hit 100-500 times that the X fleet and you have a chance to get something. Every MMORPG grinding is much more fun than this. 
I used to play this game because it did not require 1-2h dungeon clearing time or 40min siege which you should not miss - as your teammates will suffer cause of that.

The negatives, and there are two only, are:  1.  this game is pay to win to the nth degree, and 2. there is a ton of down time waiting for ships to build or repair.  To put this into perspective, building a single mid-level ship would take 4 days to build, or you can do it instantly for $20.  Yes, build one ship for $20.  You have seven fleets of 6 ships each, for a total of 42 ships.  Let's do the math here.  If you want to pay to fill up your fleets with these mid-range ships it would cost you $840!!!  That is nuts!  Well, if you want to build them without paying it would take you 168 days!!!  This also leads to a ton of down time.   After you reach level 40+ (mid range), there isn't much to do other than grind.  Many of the events are above your level, and all of the quests are done.  So you can grind.  And wait.
