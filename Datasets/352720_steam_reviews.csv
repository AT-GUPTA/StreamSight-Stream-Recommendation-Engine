I'd play it for a bit and then leave and think ""next patch I'll see what's new/grown"". Now that 1.0 has been released and after playing the various iterations of it over the years I can say I regret buying it in the first place.

The gameplay loop is a case of ""click a button to queue researching something"" and then ""click to place a building of what you just researched"" and then ""click to queue a new research"" and you repeat that over and over. Regardless of reaching the Modern era to allow starting on a harder planet the gameplay doesn't change, any AI settlement on the planet is useless,  there's zero threat to your civilisation, random events like tornadoes are no threat to what you've built, your powers as a ""god"" only serves to speed up the gameplay loop by a fraction rather than be fun/meaningful/entertaining - really your god powers don't do anything to impact gameplay. You could start the game and simply walk away and come back 5 hours later and there wouldn't be a difference. After playing a fair bit pre-release I started 1.0 by rushing to unlock the ability to start on a planet that's very hostile from the beginning. There was no challenge and it was just this dumb loop of ""click to start researching a thing that takes 20 minutes of your real-life time to complete"", and then ""place your new building that simply opens up another 20 minute wait to get the next building"".

What they've built is a really solid foundation for a modern god-game, but that's it, it's a foundation without any engaging game play, it's just a prototype. After 10 years it's so disappointing that we've paid for a mock-up of a god game whereby you click and wait for awhile and then click again. The god powers you can do are meaningless.

A little clunky but theres always something interesting going on or something to do so you dont get bored. Once you reach space age however, the game becomes a slog(in both performance and speed). At around 3 planets with a combined population of 1200~ the game began to crash often on a system with 32g ram, an ssd, 4070ti and an i7 so the giant/largest worlds dont really seem viable in the later parts of the game but a lot of simulation games suffer from that so no biggie.   My biggest gripe is that the farther you get into the game the more waiting you do and the more i found myself alt-tabbed because nothing was really happening. Sure, you can zoom around and go throw a nugget into a random kinetic generator that for some reason is unoccupied. But I never really felt an impact of micromanaging and the macro part of the game seems very interesting but once you get there it is just waiting on top of waiting. You wait for your 17 factories to produce a gas unit to then take 5 minutes to send to another factory to make that into a chemical unit so you can wait to load it onto a ship to then wait for that ship to land so you can then finally produce one cloud and put 530 units of water into a 17,000 unit crater. The research in the late game felt almost meaningless in impact. I do look forward to seeing this game getting updated and hopefully the late game gets more fleshed out. I feel like i did miss out on a chunk of content in the ""late game"" but outside of killing off my planets population to allow the game to function I cant see a way to reasonably get to it. It just lacks that ""Now it comes all together"" feeling like cities skylines, civ, etc have for me when you're 15 hours into a game and everything meshes.

It's enjoyable in the sense that you get to watch as a city (singular) becomes larger and you slowly are needed less and less. The only thing you need to worry about is placing that next production building you need after awhile. 

On the unfortunate side, Universim bills itself as a god game. What can you do as a god? Well.. nothing, really. You kind of have god powers? They aren't particularly useful. It honestly just feels like you are doing chores with them, and the actual influence you have is superficial at best. You can kind of declare war or make friends with city-states but.. it's all kind of a side note. The biggest thing you can honestly do is skip the winter using a season change mechanic. The rest of your 'god points' are spent picking up resources to build structures faster, making more population and etc. 

The game is fun maybe once. Playing it again is the same experience every time, so there isn't much replayability. The 'bad god' is basically the same experience as the 'good god'. You can also pick different technologies, such as rehabilitation instead of prison, but the game play experience doesn't change much. The game misses the mark on having actual effects on your society through the use of your god powers or gently change the way society grows, making it more violent or corporate or hippy or.. anything like that. Instead, it all boils down to the same thing. 

I still recommend it though, the price isn't awful, and the game is still fun for the most part. It really is for a specific type of person though, and I can't recommend it for everyone.

But it doesn't. 

The game mixes a lot of city building and resource management into the god-game idea, so it plays somewhat like a mix between B&W and Dyson Sphere Program. But doing neither as good as the other. 

I think it did a decent job of transitioning the more goddy early game into a more sciency late game, but at no point did I feel excited about some mechanic. I think 'boring' is a bit reductionist, but it's certainly somewhat flat.

I love the concept of the game. I enjoy it's laid back vibe. I am just very disappointed with it's current balancing. I shouldn't feel the need as a player to put on infinite creator points just to pull trees out of the ground because of the constant shortage of wood during the Space Age. The way the research tree is set up is CRIMINAL. The fact that logging is unlocked after electricity has caused so many issues with the flow of gameplay. Material refinement should never come before farming the base material faster. I unlock wood planks that can be refined from wood but don't have access to a lumber camp so this creates a scarcity of wood as if my nuggets want to build anything out of wood or upgrade anything with planks in needs to be hand collected. Current Game Setup: Material Refinement (ex. making bricks from stone and planks from wood IT UNLOCKS UPGRADING BUILDINGS WITH PLANKS AND BRICKS BEFORE BASE RESOURCE SOURCING)-> All the buildings I build require bricks and planks while my nuggets collect wood and stone by hand -> Logging Camp/Stone Mine (Collecting Stone/Wood Faster). This gameplay loop happens with several researches in the game it creates a constant resource scarcity that follows you the entire game. I was struggling to upgrade things to their medieval variant during the Space Age due to lack of basic resources that should have been farmed in abundance during Stone Age. If my nuggets can mine iron,collect oil with rigs, collect gas, make glass, collect stone they should be able to cut trees in mass. I nearly reported this as a bug because it seems like it is completely incorrect. On another note I also think electricity should be between medieval and modern age not between stone age and medieval age the light bulb was invented in 1879... WHY ARE MY NUGGETS DISCOVERING ELECTRICITY BEFORE JAIL??? Animal domestication should not be end of medieval beginning of modern should be between stone and medieval age. The medieval carriage house isn't a carriage because it is after electricity skipping horse and buggy and going straight to cars... Anyhoo I could go on all day about how the order of research is absolutely awful in this game and well as resource management. I do enjoy it though. With work it could be really great I just wouldn't recommend it to others as I wouldn't want them to experience the same waiting game. I can't tell you how many games I've restarted thinking I was the reason my nuggets never had resources thinking maybe I didn't plan well enough. Note: The trading system doesn't remedy these issues.

This game has incredible potential, but unfortunately, its current state in Beta is a bit shaky. After a few hours of gameplay, it becomes quite unstable, making it challenging to justify a purchase at this stage of development. The crashes seem to be triggered by unavoidable events, and despite setting Autosave to a 5-minute frequency for damage control, I consistently encounter a point in each playthrough where a crash is inevitable, making further progression impossible. I'll definitely revisit the game in a year or so to see how the development team has addressed these issues.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

Original review:
This game was a lot of fun....until it suddenly wasn't.
Based on what I am about to say, I cannot recommend this game. I want to, but I can't.
- This game has been in early access for YEARS. I saw some ""bug report"" posts from back in 2016. A game that is in EA for that long is a huge red flag.
- Game-breaking bugs exist, and you won't know you've hit or triggered it/them until it's far too late and you're many saves deep.
- Apparently, they are rolling out NEW features without first addressing EXISTING bugs. So they're literally coding crap on top of crap and expecting it to work.

Some of my reviews I summarize it and just say ""It's trash, don't waste your time"".
Some of my reviews I go into detail with why the game sucks.
This is not either of those categories. This is a game I genuinely dropped my entire Saturday on, enjoying it, until I realized things were wrong, broken, not working as intended, and/or I could not get to work. Many of these things were posted in the ""Known bugs"", they were things the Devs say they fixed - and clearly did not fix.
I want to love this game. It is currently broken, so I cannot recommend it. However, in a few months, or maybe another year, I fully intend on coming back to this game and play it again.

I'm really hoping they've worked the kinks out by then!

Review edit 1/14/23:
They released a patch recently and I was hoping it would help address issues. It did not.
I started a new game and within the first hour I experienced concerning problems:
- My minister of water doesn't seem to be doing a good job at all, with empty reservoirs all over the place
- I think I got unlucky with the seed because there were mountains, lakes, and oceans EVERYWHERE in conjunction with pre-determined roadways, so I had very little space for buildings. I truly don't know if it helps or hurts the game if I break the building pattern with those roads, so I tried to build with the roads, which results in a sprawling city. This is actually really, really bad, because the roads are thick (SHE REAL THICC) compared to everything else so it just takes up a lot of unnecessary space. But I don't know if the roads matter, yknow?
- Most importantly, and perhaps what is the most frustrating of it all, is my engineers did not automatically go around and repair buildings which is their sole purpose. In fact, I had NO notification that a building was about to collapse until it did, right in front of me, as I was looking at it. This was RIGHT NEXT TO an engineer's hut. WTF? I clicked the hut to see what they were doing, and both nuggets (people) were ""doing nothing"". I used the ""kickstart"" on both of them so they'd hopefully do something, and there was no change, they still did nothing.

Months ago I found issues where my nuggets basically stopped doing their jobs. I couldn't reassign them to buildings after unassigning them, and I had nuggets standing in line at water reservoirs - which were full of water - and literally dying of thirst. At the time, I destroyed literally my entire city, leveled every building, and tried to rebuild from the ground up - and it didn't work. The game's AI was stuck in whatever death loop of uselessness it found itself in.

Apparently, nothing has changed.

It really, really bothers me that they're ""releasing new content"" without addressing the GLARING bugs that EVERYONE in the community is complaining about. Do your research. Read reviews. This....this is a dumpster fire.

THIRD Review update 2/11/24:

So apparently they finally fixed the ""nugget water"" bug. But there are so many other bugs that are on top of that. This game is a mess. My original complaint stands: You don't realize you have issues until you're several saves deep. The only silver lining here is the game found ONE issue where a nugget died (but didn't?) and then it made me FORCE QUIT when I tried to save. So that was fun - 4 hours or so, several autosaves in the interim, and then it made me force crash. I'm just done. Blacklisting this game and going to ask Steam to remove it from my library.

Three strikes, you're out. It's unfortunate. This could have been so good, but it's so unbalanced, and so unpolished. It's just a mess.",1669504883,1707669566,False,5,0,0.580017030239105225,0,True,False,True

I've played 3 times, once a few years ago, before the moon colony feature was added, another time when the moon was added, and the last time at the 1.0 release.

It took them 10 years to ""finish"" this game and it's pretty obvious why that is if you waste your time playing it. The idea is good on paper, but the execution of that idea is extremely disappointing.

- Game has serious UI bugs in nearly every menu. For example, when trading resources to other settlements, if you put your mouse over the increment / decrement to change the amount you're trading, it pops up a card saying what the type of resource is... HIDING THE NUMBER, so you don't know how many you've selected to trade without moving the mouse. Other menus have text that is so small I couldn't see it without putting my face a foot way from my screen. 

- Nuggets are idiots, walk through the miasma around dead bodies constantly, giving you rapid fire hundreds of unsuppressible notifications.

- Game provides no mechanism to have buildings automatically rebuild if destroyed from natural disaster, you have to go find the building that was broken and click it to rebuild.

- The road system of the game is an incredibly stupid design, you have ZERO control over road placement, and most buildings are substantially larger than the suggested road spacing.

- If you have too many buildings queued to build, building any building takes even longer, the game's internal job system refuses to do more than one thing at a time, so you'll just wait longer and longer and longer for anything to get done.

- I literally waited 3 hours for the nuggets to load a rocket before rage quitting. The rocket was placed smack dab in the middle of my city, so all resources needed were readily available. There's no excuse for a game to take 3 hours to handle that.

- I have a Ryzen 7950x and RTX 4070. At the time i wrote this review, that's within the 5 most powerful consumer grade / non-server CPU on the market, and the current family of graphic card, though not the tippity-top card on the market. The game turns into an absolute stuttery mess when you get to the spaceage and start looking at the galaxy map, like multiple minutes in a row of 1-3FPS any time you switch back and forth between the map and the main planet view. Come on, you can't even make the game work OK on nearly top of the line hardware? Even when you STARTED the game 10 years ago?!?

- The list of problems continues ad nauseum.

This being said, it probably won't fit for people enjoying deeper games with complexities, as it truly lacks replayability or challenge. It's a perfect game to sit, relax and watch your nugget society grow. Once you get throught a full game and discover all techs, you rapidly realize that there is nothing really else to do. This game could of been great if it was deeper in one or all of these things:

1) there was actual territory control elements, with challenging AI, unique adversary gods or rampaging aliens. 
2) there was more economy simulation and ressource management with scarcity of ressources, potential deficits on bad paths, leading to difficult choices
3) There was multiplayer that could pit god alliances or god wars!

Don't get me wrong, I had a great runthrough (around 20h) the first time but got rapidly bored on the second try, simply developping the same techs and same building without consequences. Definitively a buy if you like casual simulation and to see your small civilization grow through time. Not recommended if you like deeper experiences. 6 on 10 for me

[b]BUYER BEWARE! WAIT FOR PATCHES BEFORE BUYING! FULL OF GAMEBREAKING BUGS IN ITS CURRENT STATE![/b] 

I admit, before buying this myself, I tried the ""free version"", if you know what I mean - to test this out and see for myself if it's finally finished or I should still keep it in my watchlist. Since there is no demo, you know? I played that for around 3 hours without any major bugs impacting my experience and decided... why not, why shouldn't I buy the full legit version, right? Seems good enough! And so I did. Bought the game.

10 hours into the ""legit"" version of the game here, on Steam... And I feel like I can't play anymore. Because of game-breaking bugs that prevent progression or otherwise affect the gameplay. Stuff that didn't pop up in the ""free"" version, because I didn't go all that too far back then. But once you go past super early gameplay, bugs stat popping aplenty, one after another, all sorts and kinds, which either ruin/spoil the experience or literally prevent you from progressing.

This game claims to be Release 1.0 version. But it really is not. It's raw, undercooked, to a point that even Gordon Ramsey would be mad.

The game is active and has a lot of things to do early on, progression feels good and organic, and then you hit a HUGE wall once you get into the space age. You go from needing a bit of upkeep here and there to needing MASSIVE amounts of factories everywhere, but it doesn't feel rewarding or like actual progress anymore. 
Colonizing new planets should feel exciting and new, but it mostly feels like a chore. Having to figure out the math to what to properly bring on the colonizing rocket feels just terrible, to be honest. The first time I launched a rocket I just kinda winged it, sent 30 people in the rocket, and as soon as they touched down they put every resource into residential units and we had nothing to build actual buildings with. I had to essentially start from stone age with god-planting trees and water, until I googled and figured you could send resources to the planet from a spaceport (very unintuitive UI for trading).

Additional issues I think could make for an even better game experience, because I do think this is a good game with a lot of potential:
- I really wish there was a more robust and lasting system for nugget prayers, as they are quite fun in the first few hours, and then literally disappear to never come back again. 
- There absolutely needs to be a way to permanently set building age. When colonizing a new planet, I want to, for example, ONLY place stone age buildings for a while, to not need to send industrial amounts of glass and electronics over, but the only way to do it right now is to MANUALLY, EVERY TIME you put down a building, press it and confirm it, it's abysmal. 
- Hunting lodges require too much micromanagement, so I just never build them. Having to manually place traps seems unnecessary. It also feels like there's an entire system of earth and alien lifeforms with different stats, but it's all wasted, as there's no depth to the hunting system, or the taming system, or anything to do with animals at all. 
- There HAS to be a better way to handle Builder Bots. I can't even remember if there was a tutorial message for them; if you click on them you get no details, it only slightly brings out the building interface. The button to use them is TINY and in a place it took me ages to realize was there; there's no way to ""find them"", I think the only way to know how many you have is the Trading interface, which is nuts. And it took me too long to realize how exactly they worked. I think they are a FANTASTIC idea which needs a LOT more help towards the player to understand them. Thinking Intuitively, the UI for using them could be better.
- There are basically no threats past the midgame, so it becomes quite boring once you start hitting the research and factory wall to get into the endgame. 
- Once you research everything, the game will still continue to ping you with a yellow warning that you are not researching anything, forever. Civ games have an ""infinite research"" mechanic, something like that could be implemented here; something that maybe increased relations with exiles, or helped with the environment, idk.
- Once done with research, there's nothing to do with Discovery points. Maybe have them convert into something else? Maybe we can trade DP with exile civilizations?
- Research is very focused, progressive and useful for like 65-70% of the tech tree. Then it's just ""click everything, it doesn't really matter anymore"" because the upgrades are so specific, there are no threats or economy issues at that point, so it doesn't really matter what you pick.
- The Alchemizer is not intuitive at all, neither is the Terraformer.
- Expeditions are interesting and should be fun, but they are just a massive chore that tends to yield poor results and, ironically, benefits from not upgrading past the second (maybe even first) tier, because of the gargantuan amount of resources and nuggets you need to send in to get anything worth it. Why would I spend precious electronics and plastics and employ 50 nuggets to MAYBE get 300 creator points, and 120 Discovery Points which I no longer need?
- Building upon everything previous, factories make way way way too few components. 1.7 units per minute per factory is absolutely atrocious. 

Seriously, fun game, very addictive for a good time, but needs a lot of improvement to become a GREAT game.

Firstly I want to say I had to mute the narrator right away. I can't stand the tone or the writing they are going for. It isn't the funny type of sarcastic (like snarky Bruce Campbell in Spider-Man 2, where you can laugh with it). It seems more like the kind of mean spirited sarcasm from a drunk and tired standup comic turning on the audience ""What, you actually like this? Why are you even here? This club is for losers."" Here's a quote from the game: ""Press alt+F4 for an idea of the game programmers' sense of humor."" 

Overall, the game is too linear and feels too automatic. 
I get sleepy because there doesn't feel like there is a point to playing- it's almost like nothing matters at all except for the annoying roadblocks that were hand placed to slow you down. 

I've tried caring about specific pawns but they all feel the same. You can isolate pawns with a certain gene and try to create populations with, say, increased disease resistance, but because of the simplicity of the UI it's impossible to control populations without opening the menu one by one for every pawn and it's extremely tedious- especially when the only thing you're allowed to do while paused is zoom the camera... It feels so clunky... Selective genocide should be a much faster process. 

And the genetics system is so basic it might as well not exist. If you want a population of a certain trait, you can spend hours filtering everything else out, but as soon as you turn your back, your whole population of (selected trait) will have crazy genetic drift and within a few minutes your population is just the basic mixmatch of ""weak"" and ""glutton"" and all the rest of the crappy traits you can't automatically filter out without individually dropping them from space one by one for a long time (unless you literally go in and individually make every single pawn gay except for your pawns selected genes... but by the GODS that is tedious!) 

This game should be more like an actual simulator (but I know that's harder to make than an on-the-rails game) with minimal handholding and not so much bottlenecking my choices. I also want more government type stuff other than Exiles. I want to see the different ways different societies deal with problems.

I want the game to feel different for every save file, like a civilizational roguelike. Instead, you might as well watch gameplay of this on youtube if you want a taste. 

This is a super polished demo.

I've been following the development for many years and am very happy to see the game finally finished and released. However it has just a few simple problems to be fixed before its truly a great game

For starters the biggest problem is job management system. Nuggets who are employed have kids way less then nuggets who are unemployed. This means that if you want you civilization to keep growing and not start to decline you need to manually set the town hall rate to about 40-50% employment. The way the game keeps track of how to distribute the remaining employed nuggets is a mystery to me even after completing the game. Ideally there would be a priority system, you could tell the game to auto employ nuggets at the oil jacks before employing them at the cement factory. However no such feature exists and its required to manually organize the nuggets and buildings every time you want to prioritize one resource over another. 

While the above issue is certainly the biggest headache in the game it overall does not ruin the game. Universim is still a great colony sim and the tech tree is a joy to work down. I enjoy that theirs consequences to leveling up your tech faster then your industry can handle. If you move too quickly then you might prevent yourself from building structures you otherwise would have been able too due to lack of advanced resources. It requires a extra level of thought that i found to add extra enjoyment. 

The other biggest problem this game faces is the lack of information telling you what certain things do and why they should be used. I still to this day do not know why i need to build eatery's or how to get the airport to work. Also there are some choices in the game that are almost objectively worse then others and you're not told this ahead of time. Their's no reason to choose anything besides the power plant and nuclear power plant. Pollution is a non issue in this game when you can spam parks around the map for very little cost and huge bonuses. Happiness is also a very easy mechanic to take advantage of by spamming parks and hot air balloons to the point where i rarely ever had more then one criminal in my civilization because crime rate was so low and happiness so high.

Complaints aside the game is very fun. It's incredibly satisfying watching your civilization grow and manage your resources and tech carefully. With just a quick implementation of a building priority system and some better in game tips (or better AI for the ministers since currently they do nothing or spam nuclear power plants all over my planet) this game would be golden.

In my last run for example, my game was completely ruined by a planet constantly getting colder to where it barely got warm during summer and that was it. I had gotten pollution from the black market (+CO2) by the time I understood what was going on, it was already too late. Even after restoring pollution, planting trees to get the max filled up and making pollution drop to 0, the temperatures just kept low. So a simple mistake such as getting to pollution level 2 can cause the planet to get colder but restoring it does nothing.

- The game is slow. Game play itself boils down to placing buildings while waiting for your research to progress. There are natural disasters, and the occasional event, but most of the time you're just... Waiting. I seriously considered grabbing a book to read while playing.
- Modern age buildings are huge and take up a painful amount of space. 12 hours in and my city was large enough I was struggling to place them. On this topic, buildings also require a large amount of resources so the waiting game was played once again while the buildings I had produced those resources (if the nuggets would staff them). 
- Roads are predetermined, so you can't design your own pathways. If you aren't paying attention from early on you will break the roads and mess with your nuggets ability to use vehicles in your city. Nuggets aren't even guaranteed to follow them and will wander into areas they shouldn't really be, die there, and create infected zones to give you a headache. 
- The god aspect of the game is extremely shallow. Everything requires creator points, including doing something as minor as picking something up. During my playtime I found I was mostly using my powers to heal buildings/nuggets, create trees, and shoot down UFOs. 

My suggestions:
- Game needs more to do at the very least. If you're just sitting there waiting for research, there should be something else to do. More events, perhaps. Add more interactions with nuggets. Something.
- Reduce the size of buildings to something that's more reasonable considering the size of the nuggets and how the roads seem to generate. 
- Allow the player to place roads rather than pre-generating them. It'll let players design their own city rather than being forced into the confined roads that are generated. 
- Expand the god aspect. Remove the cost to basic telekinesis, improve existing abilities, maybe add some more like spawning/breeding animals. Add context to fear/love, so doing something like using lightning to charge a battery or shoot down a UFO (if it doesn't hit anybody) would result in love rather than fear. 
- Either remove water pumps and fisheries freezing or add some form of research that would allow them to function in winter. The freezing in winter doesn't really add anything but a minor annoyance to the game.

I've outlined below what I like and what I don't like so much and unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros.

Pros:

- At first, it's quite interesting. Watching your first couple of people grow into a civilization. It's truly cool watching them go from just rocks into the space age over time.

- You receive some events you need to get involved with which fill the gap between waiting for your next research.

- The game is pretty and nice to look at. There's a lot of attention to detail in here like water effects on the camera when you go into a rain cloud. Your screen cracks (for a very short time) if you run your camera into a skyscraper, things like that.

- Space colonization is really cool. But you then face the same tediousness you did on your first world civ.

Cons:

- Upgrading building is insanely tedious. I just fly around looking for the little green icon wishing there was an ""upgrade all"" function (if there is, I've not found it yet). When your people are across the globe I'd be 4 or 5 upgrades deeper into the tree and still casually bump into things I could have previously upgraded.

- Infection Zones are an insane pain in the ass to deal with. You need to slap cemeteries everywhere (which provide unhappiness to your civ) for body disposal coverage, but if any of your folks wander outside of that zone and die, your folks will also wander through and end up all becoming infected. I absolutely hate this mechanic.

- Cattle Farms were obtuse to me. I placed them down and went on with my life not realizing I first needed to tame animals on the planet for them. I don't remember there being any tutorial or tool tips for this, maybe that's on me. I finally clicked one that didn't have any workers assigned and went ""oh, I need to assign an animal to this. OH I don't have any tamed!"" after another hour or so of gameplay. Regular farms also need you, God, to go find the seed and pull it up then drop it on a farm. Your people apparently can't find any seeds on their own.

- I'm not a fan of the road system. I wish I could build/establish where I wanted roads, but instead when you go to place a building you see these translucent outlines of what I assume are walking paths the AI have chosen. Building over one of these seems like not a big deal in the early game, but I had to uproot and rebuild numerous buildings later on to get these roads to connect once we got automobiles. Again, I wish roads were just part of the tech/building and I could manually place them where I wanted instead of being forced to build on how the AI decided to put roads.

- Later stages of the game just get boring to me. Once the events run out, you're just sitting around, waiting for the next technology to finish, then flying around in circles to see where all the buildings are that can be upgraded. You might have to deal with a random disaster, but that's really about it. It gets really stagnant around the Modern/Space Age.

Overall, I just find it more of a chore to play than the times I'm feeling excitement. I really want to like this game, but even today looking at it in my library, I can't bring myself to fire it back up.

In the begining game have quests that require you to use them and you can fail some of them if you will not have enough mana when quest will start, but it doesn't really ruin anything.

The UI needs some work and can be downright frustrating to use (for one example, when a neighboring civ wants to trade with you, there is no indication of who is trading what. It's just goods with two arrows and no text saying what's coming and what's going), and the narration walks a very thin line between cute and extremely irritating. Technological progession is a bit bizarre as well.

Pros:
- Everything you wanted Cities / SimCity to be
- Best narrator
- Hooked until the end

Cons:
- Addictive
- Dumb minister nuggets
- No good resource monitoring panel

+++ Feature request +++
- Ability to cancel planet colonization (if you colonize a planet and all nuggets die before they build a space cargo travel building or you have no enough resources - planet just colonized and empty)

It starts off fun, but the management reaches tedious levels considering you have a whole crew of ministers that should be building what you need. Especially getting nuggets to breed with each other, it's a tedious chore of matching a pink light with a blue light (yeppers, it's connect the dots but with two dots.) Housing is wonky, it starts off spreading outwards and fills up a lot of space. Then when you reach the later ages it expands upwards, but the nuggies don't live in those places first before expanding outward with even more residential structures that will just sit empty. 

Ministers don't do their job very well. I ran out of water and electricity multiple times because ministers weren't building to keep up with demand. Water collection stops entirely during the winter, I guess in this universe the entire body of water freezes instead of the first few feet of it. But your water storage that's just a big rock pool doesn't freeze during the winter. The other colonies on the planet get bubbles of immunity so you can't god smite them off the face of the planet. But you can god smite your own nuggies off the face the planet. The black market is useless, you get a few basic resources for nuggies or natural disasters.

And the road system is entirely placed by the game. You have no control over it. So you can't build a bridge across a lake then connect that bridge to another bridge across the lake. It just puts up a bunch of broken roads.

There are just a lot of strange design decisions that feel out of place or broken.

And the kicker, multiple planet sizes are still listed in game as ""Beta."" So this game isn't even ready for a full release, it should still be listed as in early access.

The more I played it the more I felt I was conned.

Edit: It would help if I had explained the Twitch bit eh? There's Twitch chat integration. So you can involve your Twitch chatters in the game while you play. There are worlds still in Beta, but Twitch chat integration works!",1706717387,1706723676,False,7,0,0.598393559455871582,0,True,False,False

[b]For MacOS Users[/b]: Avoid this game due to numerous critical bugs.

[b]Summary[/b]: An initially captivating city-builder that becomes increasingly exasperating over time, despite its decade-long development.

[h2]Pros[/h2]

[b]Addictive Gameplay[/b]: A mostly stress-free and engaging city-building experience.

[b]Vibes of a God Game[/b]: Reminiscent of 'Black & White', it's not a full god simulator but it's close.

[b]Art Style[/b]: Visually appealing, suitable for long gaming sessions.

[h2]Cons[/h2]

[b]Rampant Bugs[/b]: The game is plagued with glitches.

[b]Flawed Automation[/b]: The building automation system often creates many unnecessary structures.

[b]Worker-Governor System[/b]: If a worker or governor dies, building operations can quickly fall apart leading to high unemployment.

[b]Inconsistent UI[/b]: The user interface lacks consistency and essential information, particularly in building operations.

[b]Vague Building Descriptions[/b]: Building requirements are described ambiguously without specific details.

[b]Unclear Upgrade Benefits[/b]: Upgrading buildings increases resource consumption, but the advantages are not clearly indicated.

[b]Inadequate Wiki[/b]: The official wiki lacks crucial information.

[b]Long Loading Times[/b]: Despite a fast CPU and SSD, loading takes 20-30 seconds, which becomes bothersome due to frequent planet-switching in later stages.

[b]Performance Issues[/b]: Late-game FPS can drop dramatically; workaround solutions are only partially effective.

[b]Restrictive Road System[/b]: The prebuilt road connections limit building placement and can disrupt gameplay.

[b]Utility Building Coverage[/b]: Inconsistent coverage requirements for different utility buildings like cemeteries and police stations.

Early game

1. The narrator will constantly pester you with ""This planet is beautiful, try not to ruin it, will you?""
2. Nuggets will drink from lakes despite being meters or right next to a water reservoir/eatery

Modern-Early Space Age

1. Exiles/Enemy nuggets attack almost immediately if hostile (I.e. building tanks/helicopters, getting them destroyed, rebuilding them, and sending them out again, repeat.) It's a minor bug when you have defense towers to spawn kill them, but it could cause a lot of damage if you're unprepared.

2. Unobtanium (Both on the home planet and distant worlds) reappears as a full chunk after collecting all of it. (Happens after you disassemble the extractor) I don't know if you can still harvest the newly spawned unobtanium, but otherwise it's just a visual bug.

3. Nuggets die from thirst or hunger inches away from a reservoir or eatery

4. Nuggets walk through exile territory and get shot

5. Nuggets randomly die of blood loss (Nuggets had coffin dodger trait, although they had not become zombies. They hadn't become green nor did their thoughts/speech bar contains ""Brainnsss"" or another thought the zombified nuggets have.)

Space Age

1. Trapped on the star map. (Only happened once so far but it becomes an issue if you haven't saved the game before switching planets.) You are stuck on the star map with no option to return or travel.

2. Planet issues. Sometimes planets will randomly or constantly give an error about lack of water, food, or some other resource. Switching to the planet affected shows no issues. Ignoring it could also be dangerous because sometimes the error is real but the fakes are extremely frequent.

3. Nuggets will build a crapload of water pumps despite not needing them (I had a surplus of 8300water per minute.) They even built a pump as far out as half of the planet with no engineer or necessities.

4. Population spikes and/or declines. Leaving a planet unloads it, so I assume that the game has some sort of code to calculate pop growth, only for it to completely fail at it a few nugget generations later. The population usually stays at its current for an irl hour or so (With slight increases or decreases of 10-20) before going ballistic and increasing in the hundreds (One of my planets went from 100+ to 390.) or a total collapse in the population (1397 decreased to 750+- as of writing.) This bug goes back to the Moon Update.

5. Finally, a Game-breaking bug where after a certain amount of time has passed after the space age, your resources on the home planet (In my case, not sure about colonies) will suddenly vanish to an abysmally low number than compared to before. This has happened but is not limited to my:

Electronics (I went from 1100 to 180)

Plastic (750+ to 120+)

Chemicals (I forgot but it took it down to 100 something)

Steel beams (2,280+ to 100-200)

The 4th bug in particular is both common and annoying to deal with, putting back hours of effort randomly. 

If you can ignore the bugs, then the game is fine and a fun city builder. 
If you're looking for a god game, you may see it lacks in that characteristic, so you may be off with something else
If you're looking for warfare, this game does not contain exciting or even a mechanic, no space warships either, recommend Stellaris instead, it does have things like Planet Crackers or Alien invasions but those are easily dealt with by the few god powers you do have
If you're looking for a space exploration game, then this game will succeed in that, if you don't mind the repetitiveness of building a planet on a slightly greener, yellower, bluer, etc, planet. 

Overall this game has come a long way, but calling this the finished product is an overestimate, many things need fixing and a lot of aspects need change or expansion. Maybe until they add a workshop or frequently update the game from now on, this game stands at a 5/10 at the current 1.0 update.",1670149111,1706648851,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Other real AI civilsations with their own personality, either peaceful or aggressive, going full on fission energy and sacrificing the planet to expand fast, or green energy instead, instead of these ""exiles"" who don't do ""anything"" at all for the entire game, just sitting there with a few random buildings and maybe trade once in 30 minutes if you're friends with them or attack you when they're enemies.

Mostly you sit around waiting for research to complete, build 2-3 buildings, then sit around and wait for research to complete.

This rarely takes more than a minute.

There are a variety of god powers, but they are crippled by the ""mana"" currency, which is acquired slowly over time based on how many followers you have. You'll rarely use them for more than to move objects around or lightning strikes to kill a threat. Occasionally you'll find a ""space crate"" inside a meteor or UFO, which contains random items and sometimes a random effect like an explosion or plague.

Occasionally, I would read about updates and, once a year, I'd download and launch the game for about 30 minutes, only to uninstall it and patiently wait for its release. Finally, the release arrived. I wouldn't exactly label it a life simulator; rather, it's a city-building game with simulation elements and god-like tools.

[h3]Honestly, the first hour in this game was quite tedious[/h3]

As many have noted, the game has a slow start. The initial tasks are not impressive, and progress unfolds at a sluggish pace. As a god, you can't do much of anything interesting; you can only watch with boredom as your ant-like inhabitants slowly multiply and go about their business.

[h3]However, it happened that I ended up spending almost two evenings engrossed in it[/h3]

Eventually, the game began to unfold, introducing more events. New resources became available, new needs emerged, and every fifteen minutes, someone was demanding something from you. Strangely, it wasn't tiresome; it fueled curiosity. What will happen next? What changes will occur when I unlock this technology? Cataclysms start occurring, neighbors make demands, UFOs arrive, and the planet and water become polluted. The game keeps throwing interesting events at you. The next ten hours or so, I couldn't tear myself away.

[h3]And then, I got stuck in the interplanetary stage, and that's where I decided to call it quits[/h3]

It turned out I sent the first batch of colonists without sufficient resources, and they started dying from a lack of water. After building a spaceport, it became apparent that shuttles transporting resources were incredibly slow. While I enjoyed sending nuggets to the center of the Earth and reading the journal, there was a bug in the game: switching to another planet made your expedition disappear. This was probably the last engaging activity that kept me in the game. The essence of space exploration, as I understood it, involves building research observatories on planets, thereby increasing the research radius. After waiting for fifteen minutes, I realized I didn't have enough resources and needed to send another expedition. At this point, I realized I didn't want to deal with such repetitiveness. While I could rebuild production chains, it would again take a significant amount of time. That's when I gave up.

It was a nice way to spend a few evenings, reminiscing about the past and the existence of life/god simulators. Perhaps I'll return here in a year or so. Still, I'm glad the game finally got released.

Sure, the game will find its fans. I would have been happy to immerse myself for longer and explore the planets, but at the moment, I'm a bit tired.

It seems that the scope of the genre just doesn't allow for a well polished consistent on every stage game to be released. There are bugs, there are performance issues (playing on 7800x3d and 7900xtx, which are barely used by the game), typos, the technological tree is nonsensical, UI is simultaneously cluttered and barebones, and it's very hard to find building you need when you need them. There aren't any interactions beyond trading or conquering your neighbors on the planet and your godlike powers are boring, and limited. 

I realize now that what made Black&White interesting was inclusion of all those weird and fun quests, miniquests, secrets, interactions with your powers and people, one island offered you so much more, than an entire planet here even without research and complicated building system. Even picking up stuff is boring and tedious because it's slow, requires faith and several clicks. Throwing stuff is also somehow boring and imprecise, which is a bare minimum they could've adapted for this game. 

I'll give this 65% as it stands right now. Maybe after more polishing and dlc's it will be better, but it seems that public interest is just isn't there anymore to continue developing and releasing godsims, which is disappointing.

-------------

After getting into the space age I decided to change the review to negative. That was a big oof. I was sorta expecting an abrupt end while looking at the tech tree, but not like this. I was given a ""colonization rocket"" which forced me to bring only certain items on it, then I colonized the moon, realized that I am forced to start all over because I can't trade anything until I've built a spaceport, then realized that this is all there is because it's a rinse and repeat situation, and then game started giving me errors. 

All of the nuggets got stuck in place and died from thirst and hunger. On top of it games constantly warns you that your colonies are running out of something (water, air, food) despite having that or simply seasonal changes, and the loading between colonies takes some time even on ssd. 

You can literally see where the devs run out of money and time. It's exactly the same situation Spore was in all those years ago - thrown into space, got nothing to do but do repeatable boring stuff, colonize and terraforming, and that's it.

I thought it was going to be a mix between the legendary Black & White and Spore, but it manages to be the worst of both worlds somehow. Basically almost the whole gaming experience is queuing research to grow your civilisation, while placing the next building (unlocked by research) and solving the occasional quest (to unlock more research). There isn't really much that I can experiment with, as a god on that planet, that isn't somehow tied to unlocking more via research - that felt like a narrow obligated path. Now considering that at medieval age research steps are 6-10 minutes, I just ended up queuing a few of them, wait for one to finish, do the newly unlocked action, and repeat. There isn't much choice or variety to this evolution of the species.

The initial surprise of the autonomy showed by the little people to manage themselves was quickly replaced by a disappointing micromanagement of placing/upgrading buildings and intervening on individual nuggets when they had a request. The whole game dynamic just feels off after a few hours of gameplay, and the straw on the camel's back was an underground expedition (a tedious ""minigame"" if you want extra discovery point for some research steps) where I had to constantly assist the team, until they run out of food on the way back and rebelled, just to end up all dead losing the whole loot... 50 meters from the surface. I mean, really? So I can't even save them with a miracle? What kind of god powers are these?

Honestly, I had high hopes for this game and waited for 1.0 to purchase it, but unfortunately I cannot recommend it. It's possibly one of those games that suffered due to an excessively long gestation (10 years or so), leading to an unbalance and unenjoyable gameplay. It could've been a lot more, with extra autonomy of your people (e.g. you just direct the civilisation towards certain criteria like militarism, culture, etc. - no individual buildings placement aside from key ones) and a lot, A LOT more quests and things you could do as a god.

In brief, the game continues to lack justification for being labeled as a ""City Builder"" and ""God Game."" Despite the developers' efforts to cater to enthusiasts, they have consistently dismissed suggestions from critics. This becomes apparent once you waste money on the game, revealing it to be little more than a screensaver with limited substance.

But I've been burned in EA before so I waited. I think that was a good decision, because I can say I did enjoy my play-through, but probably wouldn't have if I got it 10 years ago in EA - thanks to those folks for funding though :) 

The Bad:
There were a couple bugs that were annoying (glitchy roads, nuggets doing weird things (spazzing out), and some services not always working correct. Also, some things are not explained well and I found myself having to look up how a mechanic worked like the robot buildings for example. All in all, not too bad for a release (though the bars not too high - looking at triple A blizzard titles here). 

The Good: 
For the most part, you get to control your civilization and progress through the ages. You have ""some"" god powers to keep them alive and must build and manage resources so that you thrive. The game, as others have said, is less about a god game and more about a casual resource manager. Basically, you get to see your buildings evolve through the ages. You manage everything from water usage within the city, planetary health (trees, water & pollution), you can be eco friendly or not (with consequences either way), you have competition with nugget factions who you can war or ally with, you can extinct the animals or eat fish and veggies, you can make your nuggets like or fear you (though it doesn't seem to mean much either way). You observe your city grow, expand and may take an active or passive role via managers in the city hall.  I find this really fun, a casual builder in which you deal with the seasons, survival, and resource management. If you like that, you probably will like the game. 

My Problem:
The issue with this game for me, as with others like it, is they have a scope that's too big and not enough time or resources to implement it. So, the game feels great at the start, middle, and first half of the end game. Albeit minor issues stated above. But, as with the other games on mind (spore, no mans sky). There isn't a good reason to play in my opinion once you're at the interplanetary phase. There's not a compelling enough goal to keep building - unless you LOVE building bases and terraforming planets for the experience. I can handle maybe 3 runs of that without a goal to actually do it. Your mileage may vary. 
So you may think, what is the issue at the space age. Well, in short, once mother planet has reached its potential with all resources and you've researched everything, the way I see it is you have two reasons to go interplanetary. The first, you have limited resource of Ubitomiam or something, the second is you need parts to rebuild the huge robot. The first reason, is not so compelling for me. This is because the resources only use appears to be to build drone nuggets. While powerful, not really necessary? I have hundreds of expendable nuggets which I can throw at tasks and put in space (where you'd think it would make most sense for a drone). However, they aren't really needed because oxygen appears to be plentiful (even when it's not suppose to be?). The nuggets appear to just go to the space shuttle and refill oxygen and so what do I need a robot for? 

As for the second reason, parts for the big robot Khraken thing. Sure that WOULD be pretty cool and worth it. But, by the time you've colonized all the planets and gotten the parts, why do you even need this thing? It just seems like a toy you get for being powerful and then lets you break a few planets or whatever. 

Goals:
So, back to goals. It would be fantastic if there was another galaxy with aliens or something to fight and conquer to ""win?"" the game. Or more unique resources to further research and do cool stuff. I'm not sure. That's my issue with these games, I don't want to rinse and repeat 1000 times just to do it. I want a reason to care, and a reason to want to. Soooooo, it's a scope issue. Caused by lack of time and/or resources, in my opinion with these types of games. 

Conclusion: 
Rant aside, for $23 on sale, it was totally worth it! It definitely gave me more than $23 worth of enjoyment. Sure, it has issues, it has missed potential. BUT, it's fun for what it is, and I thoroughly enjoyed my first 1.0 play-through. 
In a nutshell, if you also like the stuff I've mentioned in The Good and if you don't have my problem (above) or if you do, but know upfront that it's a component of this and don't care, well then --- I would enthusiastically recommend. The game is pretty fun for what it is. In my inconsequential opinion. xD -- Enjoy!",1706208448,1706227550,True,63,1,0.857504487037658691,0,True,False,False

The tech tree is quite large, and I do really like the way nuggets can expand on their own. They don't do an amazing job at it, realistically, but it gives you the player a sense that you are actually playing as a god simply watching the pawns lives.

All in all, I do really like the game despite the issues I have listed below. The aesthetic is amazing, I love the way buildings look in the late game when they are towering above the planets surface turning it into a spiky ball. If i had to rate it I'd say 6/10. Fix the notifications and it would be 8/10.

As for the unpolished parts, none are really game breaking, but they definitely do hinder my sense of immersion. In no particular order, here's what I remember.

1. Cutscenes do not pause the game, mute notifications, or clear mouse selection. This means that in every cutscene that played I kept hearing beeps and pings, and in one I had a ghostly building waving around where my mouse was being whooshed around by the camera angle changing.

2. Notifications are extremely unclear, to the point of being completely useless. The text on them scrolls back and forth, such that if you have 4 or 5 stacked up at once you're suddenly looking at a wall of text with each line shifting side to side in different directions. On top of that new notifications don't necessarily popup on top of the stack, meaning the whole stack shifts up and down with each new letter you receive. And again adding to the mess, they seem to collapse and un-collapse when you mouse near them(?). This all leads to an incomprehensible wall of text shifting around on the side that's not easy to even click through because the X markers are shifting around as well, and each message has to be clicked individually.

2.1 In addition to the previously mentioned issues with notifications, they also tend to play their audio over and over unnecessarily. At one point my nuggets sucked a lake completely dry and I was spammed with I think 93 badoop noises as every single building ran out of water at once. No matter whether I left the notification or clicked it away, a new one would stack on it a second later. Many notifications don't have useful functions attached to them, making it extremely difficult to discover where an event took place, deaths for instance.

3. The narrator tends to speak overly often in the early game. I think he repeated for me that my planet was beautiful and to please not destroy it 8 or 9 times before I muted the narrator. That choice likely lead me to much confusion later on as I couldn't hear him tell me important information. Eventually I turned him back on and he doesn't seem to spam so many lines in the late game.

4. The game could do with some additional speed scale settings, 1x 1.5x and 2x often are simply insufficient and you end up waiting around longer than I think is desired. I recommend 1x, 2x, and 4x.

5. A minister of building repair, or a click and drag repair tool would be amazing. Many times I've watched a tornado tear a hole through my town and had to manually repair each building by clicking through the menus one by one. 

6. I think tying building unlocks to quest completions is the wrong move, especially when those quests only pop once at the start of the game. In my case, I accidentally messed up the ""save my kid from  wolves"" quest when I killed the kid by accident because I was still unfamiliar with the telekinesis tool. For the rest of the game I was unable to build the parks normally unlocked by that quest. If I had declined or failed any of the other quests I fear to think what else would have remained locked for the entire game.

7. When I started sending trade routes between my main planet and the moon there must have been some errors happening in the background because the moment I hit confirm the FPS dropped precipitously for 20 to 30 seconds before seeming to resolve itself. Props for making it stable enough that events like that don't instantly crash the game. The trade routes themselves did eventually work, and I was able to drop off enough material to build a space port on the moon to receive the goods in rather than have it airdropped. When the receiving station was built the lag spike from sending items went away. Sidenote on this issue: air dropped supplies sent this way can land in water which immediately kills any pawns aboard and destroys the items inside.

8. The tech tree doesn't always make the most sense from a progression standpoint. Oil wells and electricity in the stone age which lead into fishing nets a few options later just doesn't seem right.



9. It would be nice if the resources could get a little green or red arrow indicating if the total production is above or below demand. Oil and gas for example are used in many things and knowing how many oil wells to make to meet demand is a challenge.

10. Some of the T2 mines require their own resources to make, which can turn into a chicken vs the egg scenario if you run low. T2 gas drills for instance require electronics, which themselves require gas. It doesn't exactly soft-lock you since you can build the previous tier harvester, but it would be nice if there was a prompt of some sort to say ""Hey you don't have that, defaulting to previous tier.""",1706226970,1706226970,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,1,True,False,False

If you are wanting a fun god game to kill time, this game will be adequate to the task. However, if you are trying to reclaim that feeling you got from B&W i would recommend downloading one of those titles as abandonware & purchasing a working Key for 0.XX $.

The game does very little to keep the player engaged over the course of the narrative.
I was hoping that some sea monster would rise up from the ocean and i could do battle with my god powers. 
Train and shape the animals into new species of creature.. or atleast get them to merc the opposing civilizations.

The UFO and black market coming to my stone age civilization  completely ruined my immersion. When i was unable as a god to destroy that black market, it further ruined the experience.

There needs to be a few features added to off engangement to the player.
Evil actions create a Scism where your followers found and opposing religion.

Summoning entities from beyond to do battle and have battle done would be cool.
I could ramble one for a bit with this initial commentary but will refrain.

I think it is an interesting game with decent gameplay. The price point is reasonable, but it fell far short of what i was hoping for, Perhaps there will be some other god game to fill the niche soon.

I was so happy to see this game on the Steam store, I remember the first teaser from like 10 years ago and was absolutely hyped for this. i thought it just fell off and never got made but here it is.
Back then I remember the dev putting out an announcement that he's hiring people to help with his game. I messaged him, telling I could help with language and gamer QoL type of things, never got an answer. And it seems the game paid the price for it.

But here it is now in the store. Immediately downloaded it and started playing, here are my experiences, in order:
- Game and Steam says 1.0, yet many of the features are locked, wtf.
+ Decent options menu
++ Love the narrator
++ Like what I see, humble beginnings, huge tech tree, cute graphics
- Why is 'electricity' in the 'stone age' ?!?!
- 3 ages: stone, medieval, modern, but nothing in between
+ Like the earlygame mechanics, citizens are pretty reliably doing what you need them to
-- HATE the narrator: if he tells me again not to ruin the planet, I'll bomb him (voiceline keeps repeating ad nauseum)
- get into conflict w neighbours but they are supermen. my tanks, helis, rangers all get destroyed by them, it's painful to watch
----- OK, i have no power. I do have a minister of power but I ran out anyways. Do I really need a notification of every building losing power? 120 ""TIKTOK"" notifications in 2 minutes. Then there's people dying, getting infected.
----------------- All I can hear now is the 'TIKTOK' notification sound, buildings losing power, people naturally dying, other people randomly walking into infected zones, I'm just DONE paying attention, let me turn it off.

CONCLUSION:
---Good idea, took too long to finish but had to launch anyways. Full of bugs, ineptly thought out tech routes, no regard for UX at all, early stages clearly had more thought and testing, anything from around mid-modern is rushed, not well tested.

+++Idea remains awesome, narrator is spot-on (Humankind?), really engaging at first. Bad English, bad explanation of mechanics, and badly thought out tech routes makes it suffer.

I hope the devs us the funds from the early sales to fix all I pointed out above. If they manage, this game has the chance to put Peter Molyneux to shame. But as of yet I recommend NOT to play it.

The main issue I have with it is that it's inherently boring. As the player, you mostly just sit around waiting for 6-10 minutes for researches to complete to unlock new buildings or upgrades. The game pretty much plays itself. As your civilization grows, the management overhead of managing it grows as well, but the devs 'solved' that by having researches which unlock a government position to automate areas of growth. So, as your civ grows, you focus on it less and less. Your gameplay experience mostly consists of waiting around or managing disasters. You could even let disasters do their thing, if you wanted. You could just load up like 5 researches into the research queue, get up and walk away and come back in a half hour. That's how passive the gameplay is.

Fundamentally, I think this is a flaw in the game design concept. The game just isn't challenging players to make interesting decisions. I hesitate to even call it a game? The question I keep asking myself is, ""How would I have designed this differently?"" and I think I would have gone with a more hardcore survival management game with very limited godhood powers.

The good parts of this game are the narrators banter, the art is well done, the UI is polished, the sounds are decent, overall it's a well produced game -- however, it falls apart at the game design and that is a fundamental flaw the other areas can't fix.

For those who aren't familiar with Spore, that game is another sandbox God game where you take a species through evolution from the single cell stage to becoming a space-faring species, however fans of the game usually give the most praise to the first two stages of the game, where you gradually upgrade your species, but when they become a sentient species the game transitions to a more RTS style game that was more undercooked.

Universim starts at that 'Tribal' stage, but massively expands upon the scope of that style of gameplay. You gradually take your 'Nuggets' from being a stone-age civilisation to a space-faring civ. However, unlike Spore, where that gameplay is sort-of quick and shallow, this game almost has the opposite problem. It takes a very long time to get going, especially if you take a more passive role as a 'God'. The game strongly encourages you to intervene frequently to keep your nuggets alive and flourishing. They do do some things themselves, but especially in the early stages, if you relied solely on their own autonomy to get things done, you'll be waiting a while. Especially reproduction. Nuggets are able to fall in love with each other by themselves, but it takes a while.

Gradually you unlock more methods of automation, like Ministers who are able to place certain types of buildings by themselves, but again, it takes a while. I strongly recommend that you keep the game on 2x speed for like 99% of the time, only slowing down to do crucial missions and stuff. 

I do think the game is good, but as of 1.0, after 2-ish hours (at double speed, mind you) I've just about got to the medieval stage (2 out of 4), and after that I will still have all the space stuff that was added in 1.0.

It's a long game, and I honestly think they could tighten up some of the things like research wait times, but overall, I still think it's a good game, just be aware of what sort of game it is.",1705970694,1705970694,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

The game as it stands is excellent but needs some serious improvement. As such I cannot recommend it at the moment unless you wish to purchase the game to support the developer.

Below are some issues that to me make the game not worth a purchase.

1) The road framework is procedurally generated with no means to edit them. Also roads don't provide any benefit until the modern age. Considering the benefits of having a complete road network, I cannot understand why the developer decided to implement them in such a cumbersome manner. I've had instances where paved roads don't generate even though there are no obstructing buildings. Edit: Some buildings when they upgrade will have a slightly larger footprint and cause the roads to despawn!

2) Insufficient storage space for resources unlocked later in the game. The developers have implemented two additional upgrades for storage. But it's still NOT enough considering that they've added additional resources. EDIT: This is still TRUE as of 2024.

3) No ability to change the terrain. This issue compounds with number 1, because if you want to keep the procedurally generated road network intact then if the road passes too close to a mountain or a lake, then you can't build there. Edit: This is still true as of 2024. However there is an option to snap buildings to roads. It doesn't really help though.

4) No option to empty warehouses. If you want to rebuild your warehouses somewhere else then you must wait until all the resources inside it are used up, otherwise demolishing them makes you lose the stored stuff...forever. Edit: THIS IS STILL TRUE as of 2024. You need to turn off your warehouses and let the resources empty out through normal gameplay. Wastes a lot of time.

5) Resource buildings generate resources VERY slowly. This is only a problem in the modern age and beyond as you'll need new resources to construct everything. But those manufacturing buildings are HUGE. This compounds problem 1 and 3 together to make the game So Very Enjoyable. Edit: This true as of 2024.

6) Summary of my gripes. If you want to build a compact civilisation that doesn't turn your entire planet into a wasteland. Good luck, because this isn't that game. For a game where you are a ""God"" there sure are a lot of limitations.

I'll probably add more if I come across them in future games but these are the few annoying issues that I faced while playing the game.",1626109510,1705941120,False,27,1,0.612637758255004883,0,True,False,True

I always go into power plants because they are more reliable than the other 2 options and I never run into pollution problems so I am unsure how people keep running into that issue.

Im currently 8 hours in and my civilization is booming into the medieval age now, i have so much sillyness for being proud and protective over my nuggets already. I sometimes see them do stupid silly things but i always forgive them. I love how it can be half idle at times and just watch them build their tiny misformed houses because they are not qualified to build. Also love the small details that make the game for me, as in not entering the houses during some loveydovey time and the nuggets just having regret on their actions sometimes.

So i press the button, and ... more icons appear but the next part of the tutorial shows ""press q and e to move the bulding across"" what building, what do i select? no flashing icons. lets play the press everything game and find something.

so i found the water wheel thing, and tried to place it, it goes red as you'd expect, i move it around and it goes green eventually, kinda green, the colours really go into each other. Anyway i try to place it. nothing happens. I move it around and it goes slightly red then slightly green, so that must be a thing, so i place it next to what i assume to be water ways underneath with the paths (nothings explained). 

still can't place it.

Audio and graphics are fine and gameplay is very much city builder with indirect control over your people, so standard stuff. There are also some god powers like telekinesis or healing that are available to use. 
There also should be interplanetary travel and colonisation of other celestial bodies, including moon, however this part does not work yet. Not sure about moon though, it might be possible to colonise even now, however if you switch to managing moon, your planet would stop functioning normally, same thing would happen if you get back to planet with your moon settlement. Some things, that worked before include some quests, achievements, gameplay features are no longer obtainable via normal means. Quite few things might be annoying including combat, which is ofc uncontrollable, you just tell your army to attack settlement and then watch them choose path, choose target and attack. Since enemy settlements are protected from god powers, yours won't be of any use. But biggest issue is with targeting, since every time my army attacked, units would choose farthest destination, so they'd go through whole enemy town while under fire, losing at least half of units in the process. All in all, playing was enjoyable at first, however amount of issues continued to pile up more and more, till fun was gone.

The god powers feel underwhelming, especially the ""good"" powers you have, while the ""evil"" powers also lack depth. The combat system is really, really simple and unengaging.

It is better than spore, though. I'll give it that.

not a fan of being permanently gated out of certain technologies as you progress, at the time it makes sense your choosing a path, but when you've reached the end of the tech tree, feels like those other options should open up at some point.

the world is always beautiful to look at, colonizing another world is a decent challenge pending on the path you took.

by far my favorite feature full of jokes is the clone facility  and the various traits you can modify your clones with. a positive for a couple negatives, 1 usually be an increase in some kind of need, the other an ironic twist. like reincarnate when you die losing a little bit of life span each time, till you eventually become a zombie and spread this curse to other people. i've reached endgame and am now experimenting with these a bit more.

all in all as it is before 1.0, it feels like a game of, drain the two planetoids of resources, eventually cause sociatal collapse due to lack of resources to make things for your people, and see how long you can last before then. with a limit of X2 speed this can take awhile. but with what 1.0 seems to bring, this could be a fun god sim.",1704218167,1704218167,True,14,2,0.648650288581848145,0,True,False,True

The Universim is a unique and engaging experience that allows players to take on the role of a god, shaping and guiding the development of a civilization over thousands of years. This game offers a variety of positive features that make it a must-play for strategy game enthusiasts.

One of the most appealing aspects of the Universim is its stunning graphics and world-building. The game is set in a beautiful, immersive universe that truly feels alive. Additionally, the game's unique approach to civilization building allows for a great deal of creativity and experimentation, making each play-through feel fresh and exciting.

Another positive aspect of Universim is its complex and engaging game-play mechanics. The game offers a wide range of challenges and tasks, from managing resources and dealing with natural disasters to guiding your civilization through technological advancements and societal developments.

Finally, the game's soundtrack is truly exceptional, adding an extra layer of depth and emotion to the game-play experience. Each track is beautifully composed and perfectly captures the mood and tone of the game.

While Universim is undoubtedly an excellent game, there are a few negative aspects that players should be aware of. For example, the game can be quite challenging, and players may struggle to keep their civilization alive through the many obstacles and setbacks they will face. Additionally, some players may find the game's pacing to be slow, as it takes time to build up a thriving civilization.

Finally, some players may find that the game lacks replay-ability, as once you've played through the game once, there may not be much incentive to play again. Despite these minor drawbacks, the Universim is a fantastic game that offers a unique and engaging experience for players of all skill levels.

I love the concept of being a God because it unexpectedly let's me detach from the micromanagement tendencies that I tend to have in games like Civ, Cities Skylines, Foundation, and Kingdoms Reborn. 

I feel less like I'm trying to win and more like I'm creating a simulation and f&^%&'n with the nuggets when they start annoying me. Yeeting a nugg who continuously gets sick drinking from the lake is satisfying.

I haven't gotten deep in the game yet though, so I'll come back and update this when I do. What I'm worried about is how fun this game is deep in the game.

TL;DR: It has some good ideas, but the balance and pacing is way off from where it needs to be to have a good time playing this, plus it's missing crucial QOL features you expect from games like this, the UI is bad, and it runs so excruciating slow it's impossible to make any kind of progress in a sensible amount of time.

First off, it runs extremely slow - so incredibly slow you expect it to tell you to buy diamonds to speed things up - even Settlers feel super fast in comparison, and no matter what the speed is set at, it's still ridiculously slow, to the point where you really need to dig up a thick book or find something else to do while you wait for stuff to get built or anything to happen really.

Secondly, the tutorial is crap and doesn't really explain how to play the game at all. Beyond the camera controls, there's no instruction for how to do anything, like using the god powers, you have to figure that out yourself. The narrator and a lot of dialogues make a lot of quibs and jokes, but never really tell you anything useful, or at least nothing beyond the most obvious.

Thirdly, the UI is tiny (and changing the UI doesn't make any noticeable difference) and very difficult to read even on a large monitor. When you unlock new structures, it illuminates a single pixel dot that is easily overlooked. 

Fourthly, the overall user experience is awful.
- Notifications pop up when you finish research, but don't tell you what you've unlocked, so if you can't remember what it did, you have to go back into the research tree to find it. 
- Notifications will pop up that someone's gotten sick from walking through an infected area or drinking from the lake, but there's nothing to show you where that infected area is, and it never tells you how to stop them from drinking directly from the lake. Again, you have to figure that out yourself.
--- also how do they get sick from drinking water that's supposedly to be 0% polluted?
- Dealing with the dead is a mess. If your people get sick, they'll die or turn into zombies, and either way slowly kill off the rest of your people by infecting them. And once the people start to die, for one reason or another, they usually do it in batches, which means the super slow graveyard can't process them fast enough, so you need a bunch of graveyards for just a few people or you'll end up in an irrecoverable unavoidable death spiral.

Fifthly, there are enemy factions, which the games tells you nothing about and also nothing about what to do with them, especially since there doesn't appear to be any way to build an army or any kind of structures to defend against hostiles, and when things go wrong you have no idea why, or if it's the enemy's fault.

I really cannot recommend this. You expect a god game to be slow, but this is extreme, and overall how the game plays just isn't fun. All the little issues the game has just combine into a crapfest of dull gameplay that culminates in unavoidable disaster. This is definitely in no way ready for full release.",1703541007,1703541007,False,178,20,0.637077152729034424,0,True,False,True

- You do not have unlimited power
- You won't have much control over anything, only humans
- You still need to build your city instead of focusing on the universe
- No sandbox mode

-REALLY enjoying the game after 40+ hours. There aren't a ton of resources out there for learning the game at this point which has actually been kind of nice. I start a game, learn how to do better so then start a new one. After about 4 game runs, I am on a run where I am actually colonizing the moon and such. 

-I like the little touches, right down to billboards on residential towers, the missions, etc. 

-Most things are fairly easy to figure out. 

-Watching my lil stone age huts gradually turn into towering residential towers is fun. 

-Lots of freedom to try different things. Just a really good game to come back to in between sessions with more strategic/combat-ey sorts of games.",1703491597,1703491597,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Once you get past the medieval time it feels like the I've won the game, and there isn't much incentive to go to space for me.

The space/alien market is not worth figuring out nor completing trades

I wish there was some sort of ""industry"" town hall job to automatically build new factories and mining operations because there have been times where I have had to demolish buildings to get chips, to build iron miners, to make more chips.

The different types of people aren't interesting or unique enough to make me play a new game.

If there was a way to disable disasters that would be very nice.

Wars are also very easy to win in the end, and opponents don't build more weapons after an attack.

I personally wouldn't buy it. The game currently is worth $5 at best. Now I am a city builder, survival enthusiast but even if you arent and just thought the concept of being a god and watching your civilization grow up is cool, I wouldn't recommend it. The reason is because it is completely butchered. And personally the way the game is set up I don't see them fixing it with patches. You would have to do an entire overhaul to fix the game from the ground up. The game as is feels like soemthing I would play on my phone. 

1. The game pace is slow. As in extremely slow. Ive played some slow pace builders before i.e Banished, Factorio(early game) etc. This game allows you to do 2x speed and that speed feels like what it should normally run at. But more than that everything in the game runs slow from research to pop speed.

2. Almost no ability to micro manage or individually do actions. Slow games normally make up for it by having diverse systems where you work on supply chains and so on. This game everything is automatic and you kind of hope that the game runs it properly. You can assign pops to certain buildings but thats it. I would say 60% of my time in this game has been spent watching netflix on my phone as I wait for things to get done in game. 

3. Aggressive hostile villages can be almost game breaking. I am writing this review after forcing myself to do another 7 hours on it the past few days. Im sure if I were to min max rushing them maybe it could be saved. but its frustrating because the game is slow (see 1.) and there isnt a way to speed your research consistently. You don't have ""research stations/hubs/jobs"" the game just has a set pace. and the AI is faster than you. The first time I watched my muskets get wrecked by tanks it was funny. By game 4-5 and realizing its actually impossible to stop it wasn't humorous anymore. You can try to a peace route but once again the game is so underdevloped there arent really options. At some point the AI will start attacking you even if you give them gifts nonstop. 

4. The god powers that are advertised, suck. Once again the point system used for it is unbelievably slow (see 1.) and you wont even be able to use your powers for anything. ""Why can;t you use God Powers to kill hostile villages"" because they are literally protected in a dome. If you save enough points in theory you can knock down the dome but keep in mind it will take will over 60-90 minutes to save those points on fastest god speed. or longer if you have few believers!

5. Research tree makes no sense. I would guess that most people that are drawn to these games appreciate a sense of realism. You will not find it here. You are forced to unlock electricity in the medieval age, but cant build other parts until the modern age. Its not game breaking but it is something you'll be scratching your head over. Also its frustrating as there isn't a way to speed up research or pick certain branches. The tree is set up as a bottle neck. You have to do certain technologies to get access to the rest instead of maxing out certain trees. 

6. No quests or literally any form of challenges or things to do. Which is fine to do but only if you have a solid city builder. Which this game is not.

7. Very minor, but if you work in a STEM field of any sort there will be some frustrating moments. the devs clearly have a few ideological things they want to push. And they ignore what i consider common sense but at the very least they did zero research into. Example would be a polluted lake, Ignoring their logic on how it gets polluted, 

do you get a special building to clear it? 
Maybe a project or quest to do research and clean up? 
Do you have policies that you can enact and watch the fruits of over the next 100m years? 

the answer is no to all above. Those options dont exist. Your solution is to use a god power and make it rain. That somehow solves the problem. It solves two problems, the pollution and giving a use for the normally useless god powers they try to make relevant. 

Overall its a cool concept game that the devs butchered in practice. Most of your game time will be spent placing a couple of buildings. Watching tv while you wait on fastest speed, remembering to add new research when it finally finishes. The god powers are a cool concept but essentially feel tossed in with no actual use, Fighting feels forced because its automatic, you cant control units and will watch you're 2v1 advantage in a fight go out the window because your army will go attack one at a time for some reason. The city building in general feels mediocre at best. 

Save youre money and go play something else that has at a minimum a good foundation. I realize this game is technically early access or beta (As it has been for years) but the issue is that it doesn't have a good foundation to build on. They need to strip down and redo the whole game not add a few patches. In my opinion.",1702436539,1702436539,False,11,0,0.537939310073852539,0,True,False,True

Quests are largely repetitive, with no variety for repeat playthroughs. The exploration camp is a system that is feels tacked on. Conflict in annoying as all civilizations are covered in an indestructible barrier. Electricity is introduced way to early making it another tedious system to deal with. Runaway effects take over the late game completely destroying any form of management as you desperately attempt to keep your planet together. 
The runaway effects are probably the worst part of the game, once you reach modern era your planet is on a doomsday clock, lakes will be drained, deforestation will run rampant, pollution will skyrocket. It doesn't matter how prepared you are, this era will drain the planet with no real way to stop it but to reach the space age. Of course, due to the incredibly high demand for everything, you will always have a resource deficit making it that much harder to fix the problem. Some of these issues could be fixed if their was some form of infinite resources. 
Proposed solutions: asteroid mining - more of a late game solution, deep mines - maybe through the exploration camp nuggets can set up deep mines to produce infinite but low amounts of resources, electric everything - remove the entire need for gas, destroy mountains - that will help somewhat, aquifers - similar to the deep mines but with water instead. There are a lot of ways to make this phase less annoying and I hope that one or multiple solutions are implemented to fix these problems.",1701813554,1701813673,False,5,0,0.538181066513061523,0,True,False,True

It's not finished yet. But that's the least of it, turns out there's a whole drama about developer trying to beat ARK or star citizen as the longest time on early access, so lets jump onto the game.

CONS:
- Pace of the game is SLOW, like SUPER SLOW, probably the slowest of the genre I'v ever played, and that's playing it on x2 speed. Construction is slow, nuggets movement is slow, actions in general are slow, god power adquisition is slow, its all slow, perhaps the worst offender is research time speed, you get very little for each research and you have to research every thing separate, even minor upgrades.

- Research tree is nonsense, I lost count of how many times I unlocked an upgrade or building that required me to unlock materials that you get much further ahead in the research line. For some absolutely nuts reason you can't domesticate animals until late industrial age.

- Stone age is eternal, really, it feels as if you are stuck on it for like 1/3 of the research, YOU REQUIRE ELECTRICITY TO ADVANCE TO MEDIEVAL STYLE, really wtf?

- There isn't much going on with challenges, enemies are magically protected so your god powers are pretty much useless and you dont get soldiers until much later, natural disasaters are meh at best and mostly just force you to save your god power to protect against them. To top it, enemies are forecefully scaled to be able to defend themselves against your military.

- Related to the lack of challenge, engaging with enemy tribes is extremely boring, you can't control your army so you just watch how the AI does dumb stuff, and the suposedly fun part that's god powers wont be of much use beyond healing some of your troops during the engagement due to the huge extremely resilient permanent anti god power dome enemies get. To put it simply, military conflict is extremely boring.

- Many experience changing features you select at game start are locked until you reach milestones on a game, you'll probably drop the game before you unlock all those options.

""PROS"":
- Sometimes the graphics are kinda impresive for such a game (Listen I tried really hard to give this game a win).",1701475527,1701475527,False,25,0,0.55209803581237793,3,True,False,True

Afterthought: You get to literally be god, and that in and of itself is cool. I will point out, late game things can get repetitive, and slow down. The longer you play, the more bottlenecks in resources you can run into. With that being said, it is likely just me, and some players will be able to plan around this. The narrator is funny, and it makes the game have personality. You will enjoy this game if you like laid back relaxing sandboxes.

[i] Note: [/i]
As the game is currently in early access, everything discussed below pertains solely to its current state. I won't delve into the promises of the developers, although they do sound quite ambitious.

[u]Impressions [/u]

I've been well-acquainted with city-building and simulation games for quite some time, so when I stumbled upon this game, I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary. I anticipated a typical, simplified city builder with promising mechanics but ended up with a rather interesting game in a slightly different genre. I'd call it a hybrid of a city-building simulator and an idle game. About 80% of the time, your direct involvement in the colony's life and its inhabitants is entirely optional. Most of the nuggets (our local denizens) live their own lives and only occasionally turn to us, their creator and quite literally their god, with various requests like ""help find a missing child"" or ""kill the new suitor of their now ex-wife."" The nuggets choose their own homes, tend to their natural needs, and even hold elections. Elected leaders of your colony will independently assign citizens to jobs, choose ministers with the authority to assist you in your few tasks, and build vital structures in the city according to their qualifications.

You might wonder, what's the point of the player's presence when the game manages itself quite well?

Firstly, your intervention is necessary for technological development and constructing most of the required buildings, like the engineer's hut for repairing dilapidated structures, hospitals, cemeteries, and so on. It's mainly up to you to decide where, how many, and what needs to be built.

Secondly, no one prohibits, but rather consistently hints, that intervening in processes that work even without you is possible, and sometimes necessary. As the god, you are given a set of different spells, some helpful like healing, telekinesis with various applications, instant infatuation, and others quite harmful like tornadoes and other catastrophes. So, if you desire to unleash a classic Armageddon upon your subjects, you can.

Your colony evolves from the Stone Age to the era of space launches, which is where the early access currently concludes. Not in the literal sense, but there isn't much more to do in this save.

[u]Classic Pros and Cons: [/u]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
    [*]Decent, though not the best, visual design that's not embarrassing
    [*]A fairly extensive arsenal of spells
    [*]A good autonomous colony development system, creating a sense of life
[/list]
[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
    [*]A highly debatable system of neighboring colonies living on the same planet as you, doing nothing except making trade offers
    [*]A relatively short duration of full evolution and, consequently, not the highest replayability
    [*]Not the most user-friendly building menu, not always allowing you to create something aesthetically pleasing and non-chaotic
[/list]

Summing up all that has been said, [u]I would recommend trying this game to those who want a city-building simulator with a touch of idle gameplay[/u], and [u]I definitely wouldn't recommend it to people expecting the level of classic SimCity or Cities: Skylines[/u]
Yes, there is still much to work on and many things I would completely redo. But even in its current state, it's a wonderful game for relaxed and slightly detached observation of your city's development, one that clearly deserves a chance.",1614616301,1697753548,True,2,0,0.528422713279724121,0,True,False,True

I have had seen it grow a lot despite little hours that is into it. I stopped playing because when I learn games I do it in small patches. 

This game makes a lot happen fast and sometimes slow. I've enjoyed seeing the game change and twist with the weather, seasons, nuggets going out and hunting or just doing what they do. 

The fact the game has ministers to auto manage certain foundations is great as it lets me move along while knowing the bottom line is secured. I have been focusing on upgrades now in my second playthrough and managing steady growth. 

The graphics, UI and screen visuals (ie, rain droplets on the screen while in clouds) are fun to see. The graphs to show the World's health with pollution, animal life, water supply, iron supply. So much is happening and it's amazing. 

One thing I will say is negative is resources for Iron and stuff will eventually run dry so maybe one place where you can set and forget would be nice, To allow constant but low yielding to happen. 

Another thing I hope that will be touched up is the Ministers. A parameter system for each Ministry role would be great to see. Allowing upgrades on buildings but no new builds.

I don't like changing my review for this game. Truth be told I love this game and I would be playing it right now if it weren't for the fact that it's been available for early access since 2018? This just feels like a classic example of a game that promised so much and hasn't delivered. And perhaps they will deliver, however if it was going to take five years (going on six) to get a completed game it shouldn't have gone into early access in the first place. That's just scummy sh*t. I mean honestly who's playing a game they bought 5-6 years ago that hasn't had any real improvements for nearly a year? And isn't even at full release?!? 

Come on. I honestly feel really cheated by Crytivo. I have put 199.5 hours into this game. Idk if I'll put anymore into it, but I know I won't until 1.0 is released. 

I can't really recommend this game anymore. I'm not even sure it's going to be completed. The only communication we've received is a message on discord from a Crytivo mod ""we are all very hard at work. 🙂 Thank all of you for your patience and understanding. We will have your nuggets in space exploring as soon as  the launch of 1.0 rocket is ready."" 

Whatever that means. 
-------------------------------------------------
I have waited to write this review as I wanted to have a well rounded point of view. Universim is a game that I can play without realizing the entire day has passed. There is a sense of reward when your nuggets, (nuggs as I call them), achieve their goals and advance to the next stage of civilization. What is unique about this game is you get to literally play God. You can choose to be a benevolent god and heal your nuggs, or be an evil god and sacrifice them for creator points. As the god of this world you can choose to let all of the resources run dry or direct your nuggs to an environmentally friendly future.

Edit after roads update:

Adding roads definitely improved the basic organization of my civilization. It took me some time to realize that not all paths laid out were necessary, but essentially my choice. If I placed a building in the way of the path, it would prevent the road from being built. 
I think my one real complaint, considering this is in beta still, is there are things that you have to just figure out on your own. 
For instance you need 1 well to every 8-10 nuggets and in highly populated areas. There much more that you just need to learn by playing. While I enjoy this, I didn't enjoy watching my entire civilization die of hunger and thirst without knowing what to, or what I did wrong. A few more tutorials would be needed as some people might not have the patience to get on the discord or website.",1594139137,1694280648,False,0,0,0.527870655059814453,0,True,False,True

I failed.
I start over and place the starting point again.
I got further but failed.
I place the starting point again... and the story goes like this:

I taught them to make babies. 
Wolves attacked.
I struck the wolves with lightning.
The fire started due to lightning.
I sprinkled some rain to stop it.
The people were awed.
They started believing in me.
They built a temple to worship me.
I grew in power and new abilities.
I grabbed a whale from underwater and gave it to them to eat.
They were amazed.
They prayed more to me.
My stone age city became medieval but I was behind.
Some neighborhoods didn't like that I couldn't trade what they wanted.
They attacked me with helicopters. 
I was surprised. I spent the next hour striking them down with lightning.
Then I placed trees around their protective shield and set any buildings outside of the shield on fire.
The fire spread. The neutral town was destroyed by...GOD.
I ignored my city. I had no power. No resources. My production chain was in ruins due to war.
I studied the order of the production chain. I prioritized. I rebuilt. I tried defending another town.
Slowly, I got my production up to build my army buildings. I could now attack with my people.
ATTACK! ONWARDS! Someone else threw a meteor on my power chain.
I reached the industrial age. I struck the battery with lightning. I recharged every now and then.
Many years passed and I slowly got back on my feet after many years of war.
Then UFO came and started annoying me.
Then tendrils from the ground started killing 55% of my population.
Even god gets frustrated.
I found out I could grind and sacrifice my followers for god energy.
They got unhappy.
I got rid of the tendrils.
I got rid of the UFO.
New problem. 
Not enough population to repair my civilization.
I am god. I used rejuvenation to repair my buildings on my own. 
As time passed I was dealing with grand-scale chaos.
A complete chaos in my metropolis but I found a way to turn off and control my buildings better.
I optimized my production chain. I left one neutral town alone to trade my missing resources.
I rushed to Space Age. 
I built a clone center.
New problem. Planet is in pollution.
People are getting infected.
Water is toxic.
Rain is toxic.
I used my water sprinkle power to keep the water clean.
Then I built a cloud generator to help refill the water and clean it.
Then I built a water refiller to keep the water filled.
Then after many years my production started balancing upwards.
I made clones to make lots of babies and die after making 5 babies.
Many years passed before the population grew up.
Flying cars emerged. Strong bridges.
Hyper tube to move them around planet was ignored due to lack of power.
I built many solar powers for the next few years.
I rushed to build a space station. 
I learned to make robots.
I put my team in the rocket.
I sent them to the moon.
I assigned a council to my planet and destroyed the last town with twice the army.
I landed on the moon.
I started using space technology to terraform.
And...then I took a break from my intergalactic domination to let you know...

this seems promising but i have a list of peeves that ruins the game for me

- you can't control residential and you can't directly control your civilians (they are called ""nuggets""). This doesn't seem so bad but then later on you have a bunch of buildings you need to be worked on and it feels like you can't do anything to help speed things along later in the game. you are just helplessly watching the little guys not upgrade your buildings efficiently for several hours. 

- there is not a lot of variation in HOW you build your civilization. It just automatically assumes you have a democracy and you can't do anything else. Why can't i work towards other cultures? what if i wanted to make a dictatorship where everyone eats bugs as sustenance? what if i want to make a cowboy civilization and then make it to the space age like a cyberpunk version of westworld? you can't really do much and it makes all playthroughs the same. 

-SLOW. understandable if you can't speed the game up any faster due to technical constraints, but this should have been balanced so that it is more engaging for me as the player to contribute rather than me just aimlessly doing nothing. the game play loop is just ""ok we need X building here lets place it and continue to stare at the screen doing nothing because you can't help these little idiots move resources any faster"". 



The worst of this game is that it isn't a good god sim or anything, its just an aggressively slow park management sim where you can shoot lightning at things. When i think ""god sim"" i think of having a lot of power and experimenting to my hearts desire, not being a giant magic babysitter.

Fun game/10

Unfortunately I do have to take points off for how wrongheaded they are in regards to Nuclear power. Normally I wouldn't care, but this game is going to great lengths to push an environmentalist message and this kind of misinformation can be genuinely harmful. The game purposefully makes Nuclear reactors unsustainable, causing them to output shit tons of pollution. In real life, not only are Nuclear power plants far less polluting than coal or oil, but modern reactors are incredibly safe. The few known incidents of them melting down were largely the fault of deliberate negligence or freak accidents.

Of course they're not risk-free, but the long-term risks of fossil fuels are far worse. The reality is, humanity needs energy that is both reliable and does not harm the planet. Wind, solar, etc will never be reliable enough to replace fossil fuels entirely.

I will give the developers the benefit of the doubt and assume they only designed the Nuclear reactors the way they did for the sake of game balance and they are aware of everything I have said above. If that's not the case, I sincerely hope they take my criticism into account. Thank you.

Anyway, still a fun game, still recommend.",1692055371,1692055371,True,930,37,0.937512516975402832,0,True,False,True

As I continued to play I bought into the concept a little more and understood what I signed up for. What I thought was Black and White or something of that similar calibre, The Universim is a little different and in its own way - makes sense. In short, the game requires a solid foundation from the player but slowly let's go of responsibility to the citizens. Some may like that feature, some may not. I ended up liking it, lol even though I hated it at first!

The [b]gameplay[/b] may be a little confusing at first, but the player quickly learns that the mouse literally does everything. If the player gets stuck and can't figure out what to do, usually pressing the CTRL key gives a secondary option to fix the problem. The control and engagement in the game comes in the form of planning, which consists mostly of building. Some of those responsibilities can be handed off as the game progresses, but majority of the game will require the player to ensure the city is well balanced. Other control features include being able to summon great environmental abilities, aiding the nuggets (folks), or keeping other random events like poison clouds or aliens at bay. The game does require the player to pay attention to finer balances and not to go crazy in one direction. These powers are always available, however can only be used as long as the power meter rises. Throughout the game research unlocks new perks and even let's you send some folks from the nugget race into space. Progression is reasonable but some of the building processes take some serious time. Suggest playing this one on a upcoming vacation.

The [b]graphics and visuals[/b] are pretty good in my opinion. The graphics do their fair share of immersing the player into the game by animations that are smooth. They may be simple, but they deliver the effect that things are happening on the planet. Small details were paid attention to as building construction can be seen happening block by block, with slight changes occurring around the work site. Natural disasters, mining operations, and even watching nuggets with broken bones walk are all included in this neat package. The [b]sounds and music[/b] are pretty good, although some of the clicking sounds from the notifications will drive you a little crazy after a while. If you've played Cities: Skylines you'll know what I'm talking about. There is dialogue and the narrator in the game is helpful and delightful to listen to.

Overall, the game grew on me. I do think a decent amount of time will have to be devoted to seeing progress at a bit of a slow pace, but the game does give a new approach (and maybe even breath) to the city building / colonising genre. That - I have to respect  the game for that. The additional ability to send rockets into space can keep the player coming back and wanting more. Topped up with some AIs that also inhabit planets can certainly keep someone busy. I do think the price may be a little much and even at a sale I was wincing an eye a bit. If you think my hours is worth it - I say go for it!

TO THE DEVS:
-I think the road systems need to be cleared up / touched up a bit. It seems confusing for new players jumping into the game that they can build over roads, but have them removed seems a bit confusing to whether the nuggets can travel or not still. Do they matter? I think it's a cool system, just seems a little too ""stuck and built-in"". Maybe have adaptive roads?
-Acquiring nuggetoids and bots... really needed some serious clarification for that part. 
-The toxic clouds are non stop towards the end of the game even with good planet conditions.

My people never seem to gather enough logs or stone, leaving me constantly in shortage. The game progresses at an excessively fast pace, requiring constant upgrades within the first few hours. Despite my efforts, my cities struggle to surpass a population of 180, causing a need for more jobs and upgrades without population growth. I also face issues with cemeteries lacking wood for the fire, despite an abundance of trees nearby. The game lacks crucial information outside of the tutorial, leading to failed attempts in previous runs due to unforeseen challenges like the need for education or power production. Another issue is that my people advance to the next age without my readiness, catching me unprepared and hindering my progress. Factories take an unbearable amount of time to produce anything unless you have a surplus of them, which is limited by the stagnant population growth, even in favorable atmospheric conditions.

I feel more like a silent observer more than an interfering deity, which is nice for the first five minutes. However, after taking in the beauty it would be nice to do something more than just telling your nuggets to mate.

I want to throw trees and knock down buildings and be a beneficent or malevolent creator and I just feel like those elements aren't there.

In the first 5 hours you keep getting new mechanics. I was about 50% in the game unlocks. After that it gets repetitive and harder to manage everything. Instead of expanding an conquering exiles, Most of the times you are just fixing problems in your civilization.

Beside all that it feels like you don't have much influence over whats happening. It keeps ages till people constructed a building. You don't have any influence in how your army controlls what results in many defeats that makes you only thing what did i do wrong.

Most important being more planets to play on as once you get to space on earth the game gets boring real fast.  We need more things to do/random events etc to make the game feel alive.  So it feels more alive when it always throwing a curve ball at you instead of the same crap over and over again. One simple thing they can do is add a crap ton of more traits and make it so you can mix and match not only colors but sizes of nuggets etc.,1687905144,1687905643,True,14,2,0.63874286413192749,0,True,False,True

I get wanting to promote cleaner energy and thinking about how out actions affect the world around us, but they are straight up ignoring any of the modern innovations with any of the ""extremist"" options that the game presents.  Here is a quote from the nuclear technology. ""Climate change is a made-up term used by exiles to frighten us into reducing consumption. Even our most decorated scientist believe that nonsense! if industry is to continue growing at a breakneck pace, we have to do what we do best: ignore the facts and press on!"" Now that's for a form of energy that is cleaner and less harmful than wind turbines that kills literal tens of thousands of birds a year. The game play is fun but the game has a lot of different instances of painting a large group of people they don't agree with as extremest. ""such as the NRA dig suggesting they want to give glock handguns to children."" So to summarize the games atmosphere is fun to play and worth it's price but just be aware if you a part of that group of people the devs seem to all agree on turning into villains make sure that you have thick skin.

if you keep unemployment low, and burn your enemies before they get a chance to develop the game has very little for you to do. As you progress society starts managing itself bit by bit. so it requires less and less of your direct involvement, sure plan the newer buildings that you don't have a manager for, smack the occasional saucer that drops by. Maybe I found a hack maybe getting to space will change things, but while there are things to do like expeditions, and black-market trades, the game seems to have little ""meaningful"" interactions, idk how to explain it. I can just let them be and press what to research and observe. Maybe that's the point, give the slightest of pushes here and there and watch them do things. But I come from Black and White, Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon(1,2,3)

I think the prayer system is cool, and underdeveloped. having the random quests, having people ask for divine intervention and you fulfilling that role. Trying to convert other cities stuff like that.

But yes, that's an indication of how interesting this game is, which is not at all.  It baffles me how players could give it a Very Positive rating.  The early game pace is agonizingly slow.  You can speed up time, which is a dev's way of saying, ""Here, you can make up for our design flaws by clicking this.""  The interface is much too small, and the size control didn't seem to do anything.  The autosave does not work, causing me to lose all progress twice.  The narrator is cute for a few seconds, then annoying for hours, peppering you with completely irrelevant and distracting ""flavor"" text.  It adds flavor in the same way black licorice adds flavor.  To have two of your peeps mate, you select the mating spell and then both peeps.  But where are the peeps?  If you zoom out far enough to see a wide area, the peeps can't be seen.  So you zoom in and endlessly scroll around the world looking for them.  If one of them is busy, it ignores the spell.  But the other one doesn't, so you've disabled a peep for 10 minutes while it waits for its mate to finish whatever it's doing.  I passed on naming my first baby peeps, and then was told that I'd missed out on a significant reward by doing so.  Based on achievements, 1 out of 5 players makes the same mistake.  Or else 1 out of 5 plays for less than 15 minutes, which I can understand based on my own experience.  The game suffers from ""passive indie dev"" syndrome, where one or more devs is not on fire with a vision of the finished project, so features slowly and haphazardly get added that simply add further mediocrity.

When you have your citizens, or nuggets, you can really control things within in the village. Thankfully at the town hall, I can at least have them place nuggets in a job 90% of the time! 

What won me over is working on upgrading a building and watching a nugget get struck by lightning and instantly died, in front of me. The notification reminded me of the random events that can happen. That nugget had a spouse too. Sad. So I did what any merciful God would do, I killed the spouse with a bolt of lighting that I cast down. Hopefully they found each other in the afterlife. 

The graphics are wonderful. I laughed pretty good at the Jello mold volcano. Zooming out and seeing the planet after your hours of work is rather satisfying. 

Some of the Cons to the game are the micromanaging aspects. It gets annoying to have to place all the nuggets in the work buildings. It's also a constant struggle of expanding the city and keeping the nuggets happy. Thankfully the nuggets really enjoy wind turbines for happiness. 

Overall, the UI and the game are visually appealing. Some of the mechanics take a bit to get used to, but overall I love it.

Like when you are presented a dilemma where you can either choose to research ""climate denialism"" that unlocks a nuclear power that will pollute your planet to dust, or you can unlock ""ecoholism"" where you get solar panels. Really don't like such a pushed narrative in an otherwise ""educational"" game I can see kids loving, as I would. The tech tree is also strange where you in stone age have to decide whether you want to have oil, wind power or “kinetic, excluding you from the other power sources , I guess I can accept such specialisation dilemmas, but don’t push an unscientific narrative. 

I would recommend waiting on the game to exit early access beta before buying in. My hype made me forgo my regular moral compass of not buying early access games. There is quite a lot of bugs. My civilisation for some reason experiences constant zombie apocalypses which is quite irritating. There is also quite a bit of micro managing for a “god game”, you not only have to place each building like an old sims game, but you have to micro individual citizens which can become quite a drag from mid game where you have hundreds or thousands of individuals on multiple planets roaming around inside buildings. Like if you want your population to increase faster than a slow pace, you have to match individuals to make them “mate”, whilst doing so from an birds eye perspective often creating same sex breeding couples. Keeping track on the complex supply chain of upstream supply creation to make more complex materials, seems a bit strange that a civilisation you are only supposed to guide as a god, not directly administrate as a micromanaging ruler. 

I bought into the concept for the game. Looking forward to how the game develops in a few years. Hopefully it will be fully fleshed out where you can organise a space faring race that interacts with a complexity of civilisations, aliens, its culture within and problems occurring. But it needs more work before I can recommend it. Game just simply feels quite unpolished.",1676620359,1676620779,False,10,5,0.473755747079849243,0,True,False,True

If you pick any tag out to focus on Casual would fit the most.  Buy it on sale as a curiosity.

I want to like this game, it's got some polish and potential, but let me say that the game is not what it appears to be or has tags for depending on what you are led to expect by them.  If you are looking for a precise city builder like Anno, or a real time strategy like Command and Conquer or Starcraft, this isn't it.  You do not control road placement, nuggets (the ai people) build some buildings on their own wherever they happen to decide to, making keeping things organized and easy to locate a random crapshoot at times.  Building placement seems arbitrary, has no snap to roads, and there is no placement grid.

The pacing is incredibly slow - like yawningly slow, you cannot directly control any given nugget to do specific tasks like woodcutter, or rock gatherer, there is no drag to select, and the interface is not particularly intuitive.  The basic tutorials telling you how to do things or use the interface are lacking at best.

There are also many missing QOL functions.  For example, there is no easy way to single out any particular nugget.  The user interface is clunky, and there really needs to be some kind of sidebar that lets you select individual nuggets without having to go two menus deep as it currently stands.  It also needs plumb bobs or what have you because as pretty as it is, everything sort of blurs together and finding particular people ends up a hunt just to differentiate them from the landscape, animals, buildings, and trees.  The nugget listing does not show children, so you never know how much population you actually have, and quests involving finding a missing child for example becomes a tedious scanning - in pause - of every inch of the planet.

There is also no listing in the nugget stats chart showing whether they are married or not, so making a couple out of two nuggets also becomes a chore at that stage of the game, where you have to click in the nugget stats list to locate a nugget, click on them personally to see their married status, then repeat to find another unmarried nugget, then use your matchmaking power to get them together - if you can even find the first one again without repeating the entire process.

The god powers are also rather limited, and cannot be used while paused, if you try it just does nothing at all with no indication why not, and the telekinetic power is finicky, becoming a tornado that rips things apart if you hold it too long while trying to find the place you wanted to drag something to.  

I was led to expect something kind of like a cross between an indie Anno, and a real time strategy and this is nothing of the sort.  I'd refund it until further QOL improvements, but (did I mention it's yawningly slow) I went over the 2 hour mark just figuring out how to play it at all.

352720,132650429,76561198041187437,386,4,770,0,770,1676144211,"This game is a god-game on the very surface only. I understand this is in early access, and believe me it FEELS like it, but there are so many bugs and barely-functioning features I am having a hard time understanding its current ratings. Maybe in the future, it will be fun to play, but the current state is just simply not fun.

The bugs range from confusingly mislabeled buildings (barracks show up as ""intergalactic black market"") to blank notifications with no information, to game breaking issues like the town hall ""overstaffing"" buildings. That last bug leads to a choice: do I disable the townhall and have to keep manually staffing buildings every time a nugget dies, or do I allow the town hall to over allocate, and hope I still have a few spare nuggets to place in my newer buildings?

Despite the bugs, I played all the way to the end of the existing content (about 12 hours). My overall impression of the game is that it lacks commitment to being any 1 thing. It wants to be a god game, but your power set is incredibly limited. I found myself only using them to heal people one at a time (the herb mechanic bugged for me so I never had enough for hospitals), using lightning to charge batteries or destroy new neighbors before they could put up their ""no god powers"" shield, or levitating bodies to graveyards so my population didnt become infected. The powers feel like a chore, and a boring repetitive one at that. Combine this with the busted ""fear vs love"" mechanic, and you find yourself grabbing a nugget or two for quick power refills when you need to use a power, rather than wait hours for their opinion to improve and recharge your meter at a snail's pace.

The other thing the game tries to be is a city builder / colony manager. However, the mechanics for this aspect are similarly lacking. You cannot manually layout roads, so you end up laying out a city around auto-generated pathways that can be absolutely nonsensical. God forbid (you forbid?) that you accidentally clip one of those paths either, as years later you will be left with a slow walking zone between two roads, that never seems to upgrade, even when you clear the pathway. On top of the layout, there's no way to prioritize resource distribution (you can bump a build job to ""prioritized"", but its only the one level, and does nothing for the delivery of resources once built), there's no way to force the town hall to leave worker slots empty, and the production times for resources are mind-numbingly slow. 

Lastly, there's combat. sort of. Late-ish in the game, your neighbors will begin sending orators to disrupt your city's happiness, sending disasters to destroy buildings, and occasionally even sending troops to kill your people. In my experience, this happens even if your relationship with neighbors is neutral. The only way to stop them is elimination. You cannot use any of your amazing god powers to destroy them, as all neighbors have perma-shields. You must send in an army. Unfortunately, the ""rangers"", the first military forces you unlock, are worthless against anything but wild animals. They don't move in a group/formatation, so in my experience, they most often walk one at a time into a city to be killed by superior numbers. Once you unlock tanks, however, you can wipe anyone on the planet with a single barracks. 5 tanks can take out a city with 20 rangers, 10 helis, you name it. The whole experience was so shallow, I'm not even sure why it was included. All I got for eliminating my neighbors was a reprieve from the meteors and tornados, but at the expense of an emergency trading partner.

Overall, I am incredibly disappointed. I love god-games and colony sims, so I thought this would be a slam dunk. Instead, I regret wasting the 12 hours I will never get back from this boring game. Because this is early access, I will absolutely be returning upon release to see what's fixed, but honestly, my expectations are pretty low. I will also list the bugs I saw in my playthrough below. If there's a way I can attach images, I've taken screenshots of most of these for use by the devs in fixing this.

Bugs:
- Barracks are all labeled as ""Intergalactic black market""
- Town hall assigns ~6 doctors to one hospital. only 2 do anything, and the others are simply unavailable elsewhere
- notifications of dead nuggets can pop with no text, just the skull icon. This makes it very hard to find what's happening
- nugget-bots stop being produced sometimes. I have the resources, but the timer does not click down after queuing and pressing ""start""
- wild animals sometimes glitch out and either freeze or sink into the ground. I found several mammoths just sunken halfway in a mountain",1676145735,1676145735,False,17,1,0.671832561492919922,0,True,False,True

I listed this as a positive review because I objectively believe this game is one of a kind in the city sim/builder genre and anyone who likes those games should try this out and support the developers.

However, I am dissapointed that they have not developed the space age all the way through yet.  I've had this game for awhile and one of the main sellers for me was that we (as the player) would be able to colonize MULTIPLE planets.  Right now we can only develop the moon and after that the game is kinda...done.  The replayability of it only comes with updates but every update still feels a little more of the same.  Sure its polished more and they've added some use friendly interfaces and such and new buildings, but the game always feels the same.

For example, the last update was that they added tanks and helicopters.  But nobody wanted that and combat is just a small part of the game.(originally it wasn't in it at all)  We want to explore and colonize different planets with the mother planet to look back on in our plays and say ""All this space colonization came from 2 people on mother planet"".  That's what I WANT to say and show my friends with this game.  But I cannot as it currently stands sadly.

All that being said.  It is an interesting game- and granted - developers have to deal with covid and the rising prices of everything the last couple years, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and it is also why I gave the game a positive review.

The last update they also mentioned 'different' planets so I take that to mean that at the 1.0 release, my dream will be fullfilled so heres hoping.  Cause gosh, hopefully the next install will actually stay 'installed'.",1671827954,1671827954,True,90,1,0.891054272651672363,0,True,False,True

I love throwing people into space at tremendous velocities

update 18.12.2022:
this game gets really old really fucking quick,
you have to sit there waiting for tens of minutes for either your population to go up or your resources to finish gathering because you can't progress at all sometimes,
there's virtually no threat to your civilization, nothing to really fight back against, combat barely ever happens (and is underwhelming + you have absolutely no control over the way your nuggets position themselves),
exile settlements are more like tiny outposts that don't do anything except annoy you every now and then,

the current state of aliens in this game: random ufo flies in every 2 hours to yoink a nugget or destroy a single building before fucking off back into outer space (they die to measly 2 lightning strikes)  and nuggets can't defend themselves at all from them

game has basically 0 replay value right now,
there's nothing to do here except placing stuff down, waiting for them to finish building, waiting to get more resources just so you can place more stuff down.
I set the difficulty to maximum possible and I feel like I've been using only 3 of my braincells this entire time,
 as your base grows there's just too many things to keep track of which the menus don't really help with either and the game gets extremely boring as you slowly lose the already small amount of control over your civilization

right now it's not really worth buying at all, but if you want to try it out get it on sale or crack it",1670178480,1671333242,False,0,0,0.53271031379699707,0,True,False,True

The powers are all jumbled up so sometimes you cant tell one from another until its too late, they wont color code negative powers vs positive ones so at a glance, everything looks the same. You can easily destroy your own civilization by a simple mouse misclick or a MENU foul up. 

edit: Advance time a bit, by several months. I returned to play. Its fun, and yea..they still havnt done a thing to the powers menu but maybe once they hit a 1.0 they can allow us to mod the thing  as we need.  It still will mess up my save once they patch n add more, like the entire space stage, but..ya get used to it.

I probably shouldn't have bitched about it so much considering that these developers were just trying to get their idea out into the store page, but I take back everything I said about it being misleading in the thumbnails n such. Theres been so many updates since then and theres been a whole team of devs working on what you can tell is their passion project. Theres so much been put into this game and I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone whose even considering to purchase it.

**Old review from 2018**
     I say no right now due to the fact that it is still in early development. However, once the game comes out of early dev. and gets more or the defining features shown in the previews, I will change this review.
     One example of the (misleading you could call it) parts of the first preview showed on steam is pretty much everything. Its all ideas for future expansion of the game. Currently there isn't much really to the game, not to mention the amount of bugs.
     I feel that this game could use more defining features of a civilization, and maybe be truthful in the preview and show only what is it the game, not what is an idea.",1538621101,1668044731,True,0,0,0.487179458141326904,5,True,False,True

Contrary to what the developers promise on Space Age civilizations & planet colonization, you won't get near it for long until they release something where you cannot play any previous save file. Many complained about this for years & developers don't care. I regret investing into this game as it led to useless save files & only go back to it to reminisce of similar (albeit better) old games like Populous: The Beginning.

I think this is a really strong game. It scratches the itch that the old Spore game left. It has flaws. But overall, this is a proper game and is getting stronger every update. I'm actually excited about the future of development. If this game continues at the rate it has gone so far, the final result is going to be amazing. 

I usually give negative reviews to games, but this one is just satisfying and enjoyable to play. I REALLY like this one. Enthusiastic thumbs up from me even at this state.

1. Early Access - A Preface

With any Early Access game, you need to make allowances. There's going to be bugs and many features lacking and not everything will happen on time - after all EA is often something that small studios do to keep the lights on while they are developing the game. 

That doesn't mean you have to put up with everything. Early access makes it all the more important, that you have proper process management, a capable team lead, a plan and a time frame, that probably shouldn't be longer than two or three years from EA start to release. During that time what's there of the game should be playable without constantly running into gamebreaking bugs, because if people stop enjoying the game, they are not going to stay, not to mention that it's very bad for the word of mouth factor.

If you want to look at a company that (despite their track record) actually did it right for once, consider Funcom and their ""Conan Exiles"". It went into EA and worked quite well though it had missing features. The promised a release date of one year later and they actually delivered on that promise. During that year, they broke parts of the game sometimes, but when it released it was a fairly balanced game, that offered a lot of fun.

The Universim on the other hand seems to have been plagued by missed goals and changed premises. Reading back over the development history, there seems to be a lack of experience with the demands and necessities of game development or, much simpler, process management.

Why am I mentioning all this?

Because a) there are quite a few people talking and complaining about it and b) ... I am (almost) totally going to disregard that aspect of the game from now on and merely focus of what's there to play with at the moment.


2. Playing the Game

I love games where you have lots of little individuals scurrying around, while you manage or watch over them. I don't care that it isn't really a god game as advertised but more of a city builder. I only care if the end product is fun to play.

Sigh. 

The humor and creature design style is great fun. I love the narrator's caustic delivery as well as the text commentary.

The game itself, the UI and how it presents the player with the information they need (or often neglect to), is where we run into problems.

I have lost count of the times where I started cursing, because I was trying to click on something and do a certain thing only for a completely different thing to happen. 

Disregard that the UI is often quite buggy, but it is also sluggish in its response and doesn't allow you to do certain things when paused, even though you really need the game to be paused sometimes to actually be able to click on certain things like the nuggets themselves.

The God powers you are given to manipulate your society are for the most part only useful in the early game, when your population is low enough, that you actually want to use that kind of micromanagement.

While the building design is servicable enough, it is very confusing to look at. What you want in a design is easy identifiability. You want to be able to look at your village and be able to pick out immediately what's what. That isn't the case at all here: I spend a lot of my game time searching for certain buildings and where they were built. (One of those is the archive building, that I always need to search for, whenever I try to save, which caused massive annoyance.)

This becomes even worse through the game's day/night cycle. At night it's so dark you can hardly identify any building, unless you zoom in quite a bit. City Skylines, a game that has an excellent night view, still have the foresight to allow the player to turn off the day/night cycle.

There are more problems with the way information is presented to the player. An unstaffed or mothballed building will have a little flag indicating its status. However, that flag is only ever visible from certain angles - most of the time you are just going to miss it. The is a slightly more visible icon for buildings that can be upgraded, but no icons for buildings that are currently being upgraded - which is a huge problem, because if you upgrade too many things at the same time the nugget laborers won't have time to make babies and your civilisation will shrink.

In fact there's a ton of issues like that where information is badly presented to the player (or not at all). If I wanted an overlay that showed me where all the eateries are, all the parks or all the wells - nope, not available. Imagine I would like to designate an area where nuggets should prioritize getting logs or stone from - nope, not possible. Maybe an overlay where all the buildings currently being upgraded or upgradable are highlighted with a proper color underlay ... not present.

It is probably unavoidable in any EA game that there are going to be pathing issues and that your people will just to stupid things, but the amount of problems the Universim has in that regard seems excessive. Take for example the fact that somebody working in a stone refinery at the eastern end of town might live in a house at the western end and will walk half the map whenever they go to work. It's not surprising that the stone refinery won't have a great production output. Again, I am not mentioning the hundreds of bugs that cause things to not work - this seems to point to the lack of a proper design document.

Speaking of lack of foresight, there are easy ways to get yourself into a dead end. Let's say you need more water pumps, because there is a shortage. You recently research something that let's you build even better water pumps, but those now also need advanced materials (refined stone and wood instead of normal stone and wood). So, easy, right? You just build a stone and wood refinery to make those materials. Except you can't, because those refineries need water to actually run ... and what was it I was missing in the first place exactly?

Looking at the patch history, a lot of focus seems to be put on putting in new techs and buildings. I understand that you pay those asset designers and that they aren't the ones that can work on fixing pathing issues or similar problems, but adding more content doesn't fix the underlying problems. 

I would be much more optimistic and patient about content to come, if the content that was already there showed significant signs of a consistent design vision ... and worked halfway for that matter. 

Last but not least, you often will find yourself sitting there, having nothing to do. You can't really build more for a while, because they nuggets either can't handle it or it will keep them from making babies. The player isn't really presented with choices - he's a god without a job. And then the boredom settles in.


3. A Conclusion

Universim should be exactly my kind of game - which is why I kept trying it out long after the point of massive annoyance, where I usually give up.

I did try to just build up a nice civilisation even after the point where I wasn't really enjoying myself that much anymore, when I finally ran into a gamebreaking bug repeatedly (in several games), that suddenly even appeared two to three save games back, losing me hours of progress.

Everything about the game indicates that a lot of heart and humor went into it, but it also seemingly lacks a coherent understanding of effective planning and process design.

If after this kind of development time, the UI and a focus on design that presents information at one glance haven't become the top priority, I don't have a lot of optimism: more buildings and technologies aren't going to do anything to fix what detracts from the game being fun.",1550585802,1660682203,False,58,15,0.724495053291320801,2,True,False,True

There are many great parts to this game - the Creator aspect makes it interesting to interact with your people (Nuggets) while they mostly do their own thing. The biomes add some depth to certain mechanics like farming, and I like the idea of having to find and cultivate local flora and fauna. The resource management feels fair, it never feels too easy or too hard to maintain materials. It is incredibly easy to get sucked into this game for hours at a time! 

However, as much potential as this game has, it definitely has quite a bit of room for improvement. For every one thing about the game I enjoy, there are double the amount of things I find confusing/frustrating. Many of these things could easily be fine tuned, for example the news system is incredibly annoying (I have 400 people I don't need a notification every single time two of them get married!!), the research categories have strange pacing sometimes (why are cattle farms locked for way longer than electricity? how do I have fancy skyscrapers, cobblestone roads, and a stone age cemetery all at the same time?) and the in-game menus can be hard to navigate (the building menu and nugget menu are incredibly difficult for me to navigate, I spend just as much time trying to find certain structures as I do playing the game, and once the population gets even a little large, it feels like there is no point in paying attention to my nuggets at all. It is difficult to rename them, and I wish I could customize Nuggets like I can customize clones). Also, this is just a small pet peeve, but ""looking inside"" of the residential buildings gives the exact same boring, stone age interior regardless of how big the building is or what Age we are currently in. I don't think they would have stone beds in a high rise... 

Overall, I think this game is incredibly enjoyable and worth a buy. With that being said, it is still Early Access. I have built two civilizations and have already run out of things to do. I think with a little bit of polishing and love, this game could easily be legendary.",1660513399,1660605866,True,5,2,0.589552223682403564,0,True,False,True

This game was a POS for so long, and although from the initial concept it has become somewhat distorted.
I think where it is right now...
IZ A GUDD GAME!

Shallow learning curve.
You can micro manage most this or let the ""inhabitants"" deal with the bulk of it.

You have to sacrifice your moral compass to a degree...
They took the Adam and Eve route and thus the planets populous is born from mass in breeding spawning from just two ""nuggets"".

This is the first god test... can you see these fucked up little inbred monsters worthy of your worship?
(you get cool god powers if you do)
And thus your steam refund / domination of the planet ensues.

It's basically a god sim, city builder based on a micro planetary scale.
Or as the flat earthers might say, AN ACTUAL GLOBE!

If you like city builders and pretty chill games.
Get it.

That being said, It does need some polish, mainly on the interfacing with the populace and the amount of god powers available.
Development seems slow and i hope it continues as although it feels like its 90% a full game, that last 10 percent seems like it could be a long haul yet.

If you're curious about how long it is to get from stone age to space age with the research system as it is now, it has taken me about 10hrs to get from stone to modern. I actually haven't gotten to space age yet. But this is also subjective to ones play style and pace. 

My only complaint I have right now is that when you start getting into more modern age that everything is now spaced out and tracking down where certain buildings are can be a bit difficult when a lot of the things around it look the same.

To summarize, this is actually a colony sim/city builder with god power. Your role is to guide the nuggets from the early Adam and Eve era. You help them stay alive with your god power, show them to build what they need to build (because they are not that autonomous) until they could govern themselves, and have a ministry in each division. Even with that, you would still manually place things sometimes.

Because I still need to manually build some of the buildings myself, it takes away the element of surprise. I liked it when they began to build their own settlement somewhere and I thought those Nuggets finally explored the unknown.

The game has a lot of humorous production value. But after 22 hours, I got exhausted by the tedious nature of the game. Hopefully the developers will address the two biggest issues I encountered.
1) When ""nuggets"" die of old age or other factors, their corpse turns into infectious zones -- even if you have cemeteries with workers -- so every 30-60 seconds, you are constantly clearing the bodies yourself and curing that infected.   2) When you send expeditions, the team becomes consistently ""overloaded"" with the things they find, forcing you to go in every 1-2 minutes and decide which of the loot to leave behind.

This actions require you to stop and cancel whatever other activity you were focused on, so it's just exhausting after a while.  The issue only gets worst as the population grows. Meanwhile, the game is popping up it's own random events for you to solve which are time-based, which only adds to the frustration.

I don't know if it's a need for better balancing or better in-game tips on how to overcome these issues. But having the developer address these would improve the game play considerably.",1656596600,1656596600,False,53,0,0.800004303455352783,0,True,False,True

What's the point of showing a trailer that is blatently false advertising?

Players are waiting to play the promised game and at this point the game is overpriced for an incomplete game.

Taking the game as it is right now, it's an interesting little sandbox god game with too many bad ideas which crowd out the good ones.
I always find myself in a never ending cycle of using god powers to impress the people so i have enough believers to generate enough god power points to be able to cast the god powers that are really needed when disaster strikes, cause your nuggets sure as heck can't protect themselves.
Which brings me to the next biggest issue with the game:
The nuggets are autonomous but helpless.
And stupid. 
They will build their own houses and....that's it.
They won't build their own water supply.
They won't build their own farms.
They will drink tainted ocean water and get sick constantly unless you tell them to build a well or a water reservoir.
They will starve once nearby berry bushes are depleted unless you tell them to build a farm, or tell them to build a hunting lodge.
I feel this is a leftover from my final point:

Where is the game promised at kickstarter launch all those many years ago?
This was meant to be a hands-off god game, in which the people you watched over would grow and develop and look after themselves but you could nudge them and inspire them to take certain paths of progression. 
THAT'S the game i signed on for, because there are more than enough micro-manager god games.
And guess what this one has steadily become over time?

The beginning was very fast pace learning what all of the different research did and learning how to make an efficient city. Later in the game you it feels like one of those wait-all-day mobile games with nothing to do other than deal with annoying mechanics. I understand that this is an early access game and things may change, but as of the time of this review, I would not recommend spending your money on this game.

PROS:
+Love the soundtrack/sound effects (minus a select few)
+Great idea for a game
+Very fun beginning game
+Like how you play the role of a creator and have the creator abilities

CONS:
- The death sound is very annoying and unable to be turned off without turning off other critical sounds. In my city of 300+ Nuggets the death sound becomes very annoying.
- Death. Cemeteries do not do a great job of collecting the dead. The dead end up creating ""Infected Zones"" that are annoying to deal with and feel like a waste of creator points to deal with.
- Roads and residential areas feel randomly placed which limits the ability to plan your city.
- Engineers are useless. I had multiple Engineer Buildings covering buildings (and staffed), but the buildings would still need to be manually repaired with creator points.
- Late game/late research stages is just a waiting game dealing with all of the annoying functions I listed above while researching new technologies. If there was a meaningful way to spend time researching without dealing with not fun mechanics then it would be different.

I'm not really sure about this one. Feels a lot like a city game but you can't adjust anything like roads and nothing gets done, the god game aspect is not to be found as apparently you don't care about the planet, animals etc whatsoever.

-This is a very good blend of city-building and god-simulation, probably one of the best ones I've played so far (and yes, even tho it's in EA)
-I personally really enjoy 'Ancient' civs evolving to 'Advanced' civs themes to games, so this was a great execution of that sort of theme
-I also actually enjoy the narrator as an aspect to the game, I think some of what he says is funny but it can get old after a while

CONS:
-Very micro-management for the first hours as you'd expect, it gets slightly better (but not a whole lot) as you progress as you grant Nuggets more autonomy through age-advancement of the civ and by assigning someone to oversee the ""department"" of whatever work is being done. IE: Department of Water builds water wheels and assigns nuggets, Department of Agriculture does this with farms, etc... Expected for a city-builder but not really something you'd see in a god-sim; so take that as you would.
-The game has 3 speeds; pause, 1x and 2x. 1x feels pretty slow and 2x is noticeably faster. Unfortunately though, it still seems to take a long time for things (building, carting away corpses, etc...) to ever get done for some reason to me; it eventually does get finished, but it feels off in my opinion because even a the 'fastest' speed it's still an effort to get things done.
-Research takes realtime, meaning that the lowest costing researches (sans DP-research) is about 5 minutes. Some take upwards of 15 minutes. I get research taking time, as you would expect it to but even with the time-lapse set to 2x, there is not a noticeable difference in research. As it would appear, the completion of tasks and other things within the viewport of the world doubles (Nuggets move faster, collect resources faster, etc...) but ostensibly the Research tree progresses independently of that time-lapse change; so 5 minutes is still 5 minutes (and not the 2 minutes 30 seconds you'd expect at 2x speed).



TL;DR: I'm not selling it with a more detailed 'cons' list but it's because having played the game, these issues cause breaks to the gameplay loop (at least for me); but in EA titles you want to provide that kind of feedback. So while I might be pointing out mechanical issues, I can't stress how much fun I HAVE had playing this, the words elude me.",1652469087,1652469087,True,40,3,0.794219434261322021,0,True,False,True

The game is fantastic Time killing fun
Fun as its neat seeing your Stone age nuggets adapt into the modern society
The game is slow paced. Has a skill tree with a lot of unlocks.
You can speed up some of the progress but not at a point were patience is still a thing you must have. Anyone remember the Game BLACK AND WHITE should feel a little at home with this game minus the huge Monsters.
You as a god keep your city happy. 
Nuggets will Riot and Protest, 
You can Micromanage a lot of things but it is not a game breaker were it is a must.
Examples : Like Sim City you can monitor pollution and Crime and so on, but as you play the game it depends on your decision weather you make it hard on yourself and pollute the environment or build away factory's that if you build to many they get mad cause you destroying the earth.
The game has a lot of stuff and you cannot control where the nuggets build, but you can build everything else.
You can name them but nuggets life span are short at first so they will die and sometimes you wont even know it unless you keep close tabs. 
I recommend this game to anyone that likes to build and see a civilization grow from Type 1 to a Type 4 or 5. 
Their are random Alien Abductions
You can sell nuggets to aliens for resources
Trade with other villages
Random attacks, natural disasters

the game itself basically uses the concept of evolution, using a custom game engine based off unity (called prometheus) that renders a complete planet that you start a civilization on, it starts in the stone age, an age of new dawn and wonder, with time you research and discover different types of technology, with that you evolve into the medieval age, it involves the invention of electricity and the automobile (nuggets evolved differently than humans), of course this is where the beginning of cement and glass is made, on top of the start of pollution, then you move into the modern age, an age of lights, flight, and the beginning of true industry and discovery, with it pollution is a lot more common BUT this is when you can start combating the pollution with parks (not much but at least it works), at this point your nuggets start looking up at the stars and try to find a way to reach them, finally you move onto the best age, The Space Age, you've finally done it, you and your nuggets have finally started exploring the stars, with many types of planets.

Barren planets: not much to find here but makes a great terraforming candidate (yes he said terraforming :D ).
Ice planets: a planet of hard cold ice that will need a little warmth to make habitable (Brrrr, dont forget a coat when coming here :s  )
Lava planets: OUCH! OH! OW! VERY HOT! this planet is clearly an early planet that needs some cooling down to start living on it, but is very rich in resources so its very much worth the heat (YOU SAY THIS PLANET IS GREAT BUT MY FUCKING SKIN IS MELTING!  D:< )
Life planets: The rarest of them all, planets with animals of weird design and unknown strength, i recommend scanning this place before going (this is so beautiful, oh look a tiny alien hi ther- *it grabs on to face* AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!  0 O 0).

BUT BEWARE! you are not alone, there is another civilization thats a little more.....sinister (oh nuu :O ), yes i am talking about aliens but THEY. ARE. NOT. FRIENDLY! and if you are really unlucky you will meet.....The Planet Cracker...(the planet WHAT?!) an ancient machine that will destroy not just buildings nor people, but the ENTIRE planet itself, so be wary of its presence, for you may not know when it will come for you.

in all seriousness this is a great game and i recommend it. (im here too :D )

Keep in mind not everything here mention is in the game yet, BUT at the time of writing this you can go to the moon.",1650748365,1650748596,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

PRO:
1- Nuggets are highly autonomous so you don't have to micromanage them. For instance, if they're low on water they know what to build
2- You can prioritize buildings 
3- You can use God Powers (GP) in the list of all the nuggets. There is also a search bar

PRO or CON depending on player preference:
1- Easy when on neutral 
2- Evolution happens very fast (in my 11 hours of playing I am almost at space age)

CONs:
1- Unlike with the Nuggets, you cannot revitalize or use any other GP when in the buildings menu. To revitalize a building, which you will be doing very often, you have to travel to that location.
2- The buildings menu organization is a disaster. You have to click a dropdown and deselect everything to then select the buildings you want to look at. I'd rather have a search bar like the nugget menu
3- The research tree is another disaster
3a- Research is non-linear for a lot of it. If you skip one of the subcategories you could end up in the middle of the modern era with research still locked from the stone age
3b- I would rather have it broken down. I really like the way Surviving Mars has their research tree set up. I would recommend something like, citizen happiness, medicine, education, production, and technology. Additionally you should not be able to move on from one era without all categories researched
3c- I hate the discovery points. I think they should be used as an option to speed up research, but for many of the research nodes you cannot unlock them without a certain number of discovery points. This holds you back from later research when a random node in the main research line requires one of the discovery point ones from way earlier in the game. 

Tip based on what my downfall was in my first attempt:
Build lots of cemeteries - if you don't, dead bodies will fill the streets and infect/kill nuggets. My cemetery workers were not fast enough at body collection so I tried to help by using my telekinesis and throwing corpses into the lakes. That was a very bad idea. The environment very quickly became toxic.

I only played for 7 hours and I only played my starter civ so there may well be solutions to the issues I'm going to talk about even now but I haven't been able to easily find them which would also be an issue.

So to list a few reasons why I think the game needs more time in the oven and more importantly what you could do to make it better (maybe):

The game will spam you with event messages in the bottom right. Please get rid of the confusing list and just let me click the messages to move my camera to where the event happened. This would be the most useful almost every time. I know you can do it because the alarms(?) in the top left have that ability.

Make wonders more important to the core gameplay than they are. By midgame I was barely using them, only filled up a lake with rain every now and then, zapped a UFO, or casted the bubble to prevent the bad guys from sending meteors my way. Speaking of which...

There will be exile towns who may or may not send bad things your way but there is no way to crush them because they have an impenetrable shield. This is super annoying. You have these awesome wonders with ultimately very little to use them on. You just have to live with these towns bothering you every now and then. Let me destroy them and have new exile towns pop up quicker if you feel the need to have them in the game constantly.

Have an obvious hotkey for the build menu and display it in the tutorial.

Increase optimisation. A game that looks like this (don't get me wrong the graphics are nice and cute but ultimately not what I would call high fidelity) shouldn't stutter on an i7 and and an RTX2080.

Ultimately, by the modern age, I found my wonders to be nigh on useless, my population stagnated, people started getting sick from drinking from the lake even though I had water reservoires everywhere and water in them and they started dying and I didn't know why and I couldn't easily figure it out and it all just ended in this cacophony of notifications that weren't immediately actionable for me and I was just reduced to being the city planner / janitor like in every other sim game and the game really started to feel like a chore and so I quit.

For being called the creator I feel like you create very little and more like you manage a bunch of morons. I hope this will change. I hunger for a good god game but this isn't it in its current state.",1648570174,1648570174,False,19,0,0.59491431713104248,3,True,False,True

This game has been in development for a long time.... 2013 on Kickstarter... 

So, its a neat idea but it feels like the features added just take away from the game, you can automate the AI from every aspect but why?

There's a lot here and its a nice looking game but there's only one way to really play it and that's how the game is designed which really holds it back. I just want all the traditional city builder freedom that I can get in any other game put into this and this would be an instant gem... 

God mode is nice but hardly has any point in the game, its like adding a bit of ""creativity"" to survival mode...

I think people are sleeping on this game and it's undiserved. The game is still updated ragularly, the devs gave a FREE dlc style update that added a bunch of new planets and space colonization after you get to the space age and they still have more stuff they plan on adding!

In this game you can:
Sacrifice your pops in a meat grinder (what your church doesn't have one?) 
Rain meteors on your enemies. Summon tornadoes, earthquakes and lightning. pick up a whale and let it hit the ground at terminal velocity for efficient feeding of your pops (mind your head though)
Haven't found any bugs myself. 

Some small things I don't like but might be fixed or changed in the future. Roads are predetermined at world gen so you are forced to build around whatever you get (you can build over roads but that will hurt you in the long run if you do it too much) 
I also don't like how much the narrator talks, he's snarky but after the first few times it just gets annoying. 
Late game fps drops a lot even on normal speed. 

If you like playing as a god and city management then you will like this game.

Basically control a civilization through ages that are semi-historical, and then conquer space (though that feature has been barely implemented yet, with the Moon Update just adding the first new colonizable territory, and I think it will be refined).

Around the modern period is when it gets absolutely annoying as everything takes increasingly more advanced resources which... well wouldn't be a problem. IF THOSE RESOURCES COULD BE PRODUCED FAST ENOUGH. Did I mention that all resources are produced at angonizingly slow rates where you will be waiting for steel and electronics for hours? 

Did I mention that half of the creator powers will make your people hate you even when you're helping them? (Telekinesis for picking up dead bodies or resources and lightning bolts to kill enemies even when no friendlies are hit by said bolt) 

Did I mention that half the buildings in the Modern Period ESPECIALLY engineers take educated workers? Did I mention that schools can only teach three people and requires advanced resources like steel (Which take educated workers to produce) to be upgraded to the next level? 

Vehicles CANNOT store large amounts of resources. People will take resources by hand, sit with it on their lap, and go to places to build things so don't go thinking vehicles help. 

And to get to the worst, absolutely worst part... POWER. If you use power that will not kill the planet that your popluation lives on over time (Ie the wind power) you will NEVER HAVE POWER late game. I have over 30 Wind turbines in my city. But guess what, Wind power is global so if one runs out of wind? Then all of them do on the entire planet. And even if you turn off the news sounds? The 'power shortage' will play endlessly without fail or stopping until your wind turbines are able to squeeze out a single bit of power into your batteries.. and then immediately stop working. 

This forces you, outright, to use things that outright produce pollution because if you don't, you literally will not have power at all. 

This game IS basically thirty steps forward into the future and then immediately falling back 100 steps after a certain period. You should wait until later before you can really play this.",1646540798,1646540798,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The road management is pretty F'ed as well. You can't set your own roads - you just kinda have to deal with what's there but it's pretty broken.

In the beginning it seems kinda cool - like oh this is going to be a spiritual successor to Black and White. But in the end the god powers are essentially useless.

City Builders are one of my favorite genres and adding in some of the god mechanics has made this Early Access game even more appealing.  But, the question remains, is it worth your time?  Let’s discuss.

Nuggets not Spores:  At the core this game is a colony simulation, though I wouldn’t add any serious survival tag to it as the game is very easy and there is very little you can do to just flat out destroy your civilization.  Everything seems to have multiple ways to recover be it technology or your god powers.  I can see that there may be frustrating parts (read below) but nothing game ending.  The game diverts from the normal colony builders by giving you literal godlike powers like the ability to make natural weather occur or moving things yourself but this is dependent on your creations believing in you and generating Creator Points.  It also deviates by allowing your nuggets have a certain level of autonomy not shown in most games of this genre, they build their own residences and with the help of a Town Hall will even build various other structures on their own which is a deceptively ingenious alteration of this genre.  These Ministries, as the game calls it, is a great idea that I enjoy but came with some minor annoyances (I had to fire my Defense Minister when he wouldn’t stop building defense towers when we were zero crime, with no other cities on the planet and killing our happiness).

Let there be Light:  This game is beautiful, from the sound effects, to the art style and music though I wouldn’t consider it revolutionary, it does a great job at really creating that vibe that you are in control and everything is just a matter of time.  The graphic design is at the same time creative and simple which allows the game to handle an obscene amount of items on the screen without weighing down the performance.  I will point out that several of the buildings can be a bit annoying to locate due to their appearance, some look like others or just not distinctive enough (especially during the Stone-Age) and the City can just be plainly annoying to search during the Modern / Space Ages.  When the city starts to come together there is a beautiful chaos about it that hurts my OCD but such a great sight.  The game also evolves the roads as you progress but I’d like to see the roads dynamically alter as you build as of right now they don’t seem to adapt to your planning and you can't build them yourself.

Tower Defense Game:  A game of this complexity and still in early access still has a lot of work to be done and some weaknesses that I’m not sure that can be easily overcame.  One such weakness is that as your society progresses it progressively builds itself and that you have no direct control over growth.  This really isn’t as much of a problem as the potential to be boring.  One issue does rise in that when you get a certain point (late stone age for me) you are just waiting for the research to catch up, building a few new structures then waiting again.  Even at double speed I found myself getting up from my desk a few times.  The game tries to make some branches on specific technologies but none of them felt game changing in a positive way, and the one that was provided more of a hindrance that just slowed the game down (I picked wind power, felt like the game spent hours at a time with no wind).  I will also state the environmental system needs some work, there are no foresting controls or such and no real way to progress far enough to remove pollution without god-powers.  Finally, the tech tree needs some massive work, I don’t understand why I’m learning electrical grid tech during the stone age, medieval at the very earliest and like I mentioned earlier the tech does seem front loaded leaving new structures being fairly rare (until space age) and just getting upgraded versions as most of the research options.  There are a host of issues with the Space-Age but being that it just came out I’m going to pass on discussing it for now; suffice to say it has the chance of expanding the game greatly if done right.

Nuclear…it’s pronounced Nuclear:  Okay, small side tangent, was slightly annoyed that Nuclear technology is considered the ‘dirty’ power source and solar is the ‘clean’ one.  Current technology aside, Nuclear should have been a clean technology that eventually leads to fission or something such and maybe some kind of ‘super’ coal plant for the dirty solution.  This is a side tangent that should have no bearing on the quality of the game but I feel there is a positive undercurrent abound environmentalism in this game, which I believe is overall positive but definitely needs to come to the current year on Nuclear technology and away from the 70's three eyed fish fears. 

In many ways I think this is less of a spiritual successor to Black & White and more of the Spore game we were promised many years ago.  But regardless I’m very happy to see a god game come to the table again.  I will say that as most colony builders in Early Access there currently is a cut-off where you stop really having things to do but I’m confident that is something that can be remedied in time.  At this time, I’d recommend waiting for a sale but definitely pick this up.  Enjoy!",1646438455,1646438806,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You have the option of using creator to destroy the enemy temple, which is now shielded and takes a metric butt-ton of repeated attacks.  You have the option of blasting or tele-tossing bands of attacking warriors with your creator powers as they occur.  However, these attacks on the enemy, or defensive measures still inspire fear among your followers, even when it is their mortal enemies you are smiting down with your wrath. Either way, your CP generation will drop and you will be forced to grind up a few of your nuggets for emergency CP points during a disaster etc.  

You literally are managing a group of sheep bred for slaughter.  They do not retaliate... They do not band together and defend themselves... they just die.  -unless you intervene of course, which will loop back to the path of malevolence.  War and defensive retaliation is a crude, yet fundamental aspect of any civilization as we know it.  This game completely misses that mark.

There are lots of bugs still to work out but I hope the devs change the art style as its quite cartoonish/ babyish. Pros and cons below:

Pros
- Love the idea of building a civ from stone age to space age and beyond!
- Its nice to see the planet rather than a cut out piece of land compared with other city builders.

Cons
- The art style (especially the aliens and buildings) is quite childish. I think most of the buildings look chunky a bit like children's toys and the aliens look like cuddly stuffed toys.
- Nuggets all seem to get infected and its frustrating to find all the dead nuggets and clear out infection zones manually, especially when you have a big city.
- Nuggets drink from the lake even if you have lots of water storage
- Building placement is clumsy and looks messy
- Town hall ministers make more problems than they solve. I headed back to the main planet and the town hall minister had built so many water pumps on all coast lines. All pumps were only half built as there were not enough resources. 
- This also created major issues as I had to manually click on each pump and destroy, but then also had to click on them again to scavenge plus the wait time for the nuggets to get there and actually do the scavenging. 
- Nice big tech tree, however, research feels hollow as you could just put on auto and all this really does is slow down the game a little. I like the approach to select a research branch line and the other will be locked e.g. combustion vs eco energy. I think more of this would be great then players can replay and follow a different path.
- I thought the clone center would allow me to produce more population with chosen characteristics but you can only create a few clones at a time and there is no option to save a template clone and copy many times. 
- Nuggets constantly cut down tree and mine stone. It would be nice to switch this on/off.
- Spend a lot of time manually finding things on the map or searching through the building/ nugget menus. I think a few more indicators on the map would make a big difference.

Overall I think the game has some really good ideas and concepts, and I really hope things progress. I'll probably stop playing and wait and see what new updates bring. The trailer is good but I do regret buying the game in its current state as it misses the mark on many levels, for me. I'm not a developer or anything but appreciate that a huge number of hours of work and energy went into this and sure a great many people love the game!

The longer version goes like this. The game starts very strong with you having a small stone age settlement and convincing them to believe in you by doing various task for them. Researching a tech takes less than 5 minutes and there is a rush  to get the basic researched and placed before your first winter. At this stage it's pretty good and you constantly have something to do. 

Then your society expands quickly and you reach the mid game and your engagment drops dramatically. Maybe you occasionally refill some lakes with rain or speed up a building or create a dome to protect your civ from a disaster but most of the time your idly waiting for a expedition underground to do something and that typically is staring at a screen while a little dot is moving around and hitting camp when they complain they are tired. You still build as you haven't really gotten all the techs that allows the AI to make decisions for itself but if you forget something it is honestly not urgent and at this point you will struggle to lose the game. I literally nuked my own civilization from orbit with several meteors and lit major urban hubs on fire trying to kill everyone but they still kept bouncing back. Issue with it is that after your first few ppl the game makes it so everyone is a believer in you so your no longer really doing much with your people to convince them to believe in you outside of big milestone techs (which btw take 20 mins to complete now).

 Then theres late game and god is it dull. More waiting on the expedition screen, maybe occcasionally you trade some faith or people  away or eat a disaster you still save with the magic dome for a couple dozen materials or a blueprint for a legendary building like the eye of london or what have you. Techs take forever and you just sit there waiting and waiting and waiting. Honestly I was so flushed with faith and so bored I'd pop up to the other side of the planet, grow a forest, then light it on fire just to watch it burn from orbit. Occasionally Id summon down a meteor in the moutains to spawn a loot box but in general they are so tedious to open it's not worth it (for each box you click 5 times then move it over to your main base and wait a few minutes). I think one time there was a protest that I zapped with lightning but that was because I made it stay in winterfor a long time and water ran out. Just so much freaking boredom. The worst part is by now you unlocked everything for the ai to make its own decisions so you don't even really build anymore. You'd think pollution or deforestation would be a problem by now but not at all as even basic parks make a significant dent in it and you just chose your electricity style when you unlock it so you always just get solar but honestly even regular combustion power is countered out by park spam.

In the 8 hours I've had this game I went through this twice both to late game and both times it was frankly boringly painful. I actually enjoyed my second playthrough as a evil god more as you can pick up your people and throw them from orbit into a grinder for extra faith and theres a buzzer and confetti sometimes so it felt like I could have some fun mid game. I also skipped a lot of unnecassary/useless techs in my second game which made me hit late game in about 3 hours I think.

The game is really hard to recommend for me in the end here. On the surface there's a lot here. Convincing ppl to believe in you, building a city,going to space, exploring the underground, disasters, etc. but there sin't much engagement or depth with any of it. It's also just painfully slow and boring witha max speed of 2x real time meaning your sitting there waiting for so long. Honestly I am kinda convinced the game wouldn't even need a player if they made those automation techs default instead of buried behind a ton of useless/ borderline useless techs.",1645546048,1645546048,False,5,2,0.569785714149475098,0,True,False,True

It is still very barebone:

1. [b]The introduction of features is not very good.[/b]
For example, you have god powers that can be selected with middle mouse, and then activated with ctrl+click. But the game only tell the choose power part (middle mouse), it doesn't tell you how to use it (ctrl+click).

I had to google how to use the power for tutorial quest.

2. [b]A lot of idle time[/b]
The ""so.... what should I do now really?"" kind of idle.

In Black and White, a very similar game, you can spend your idle time to explore the island's secrets, or help out villagers with tasks. But in this game there's not many secrets, and helping out villagers cost resources (god's energy kind of thing) - which need time to accumulate - so you don't really want to help until there's something in it for you (like a villager's request).

You can explore the planet for randomly generated event (I only know of seeds for farm and technology box now), but it's a huge chore. Having to rotate the planet every once in awhile looking again and again for those meteor is sooo frustrating, not fun.

In the begining, you'll help your town build, thrive and overcome its obsticles. Whether you're helping them build or saving them from a wolfpack, you get to decide how you want to help your civ. Each building is considered and planned, with the games' own organic city growth. And then the problems begin.

Before long, you are constantly fighting a losing battle of placing buildings that are essentially dictated to you. Your God powers are pointless because the regen is appallingly slow and your neighbours have free reign to drop a meteor on your city center. Oh and don't worry about fighting back, even if you had the points, as they have an unlimited sheild to save them from you.

Progression is now a sense of ""Thank **** that's done, what else did these ****heads want? Oh nevermind, they're all sick because all that infrastructure doesn't mean **** when they ignore it and drink dirty water"". After a while you're just placing cemetaries and throwing the little idiots into the proverbial bin because the logic is severely broken.  

All said and done, I think I'll let this one bake for a lot longer before giving it another shot. It has so much potential but so many hurdles to overcome. The excuses are nice but, ultimately, that won't sell your game to the general public and it'll be just another miss in a sea of disappointing releases from the last few years.

I will try to be as clear as possible as to why this game didn't meet my own personal expectations;

As a fan of the old ""Black and White"" games, I was looking for something that would give me a similar feel to that nostalgia.  I wanted to be a ""God"" with my main goal being to simply hold the faith of the citizens and perform miracles, maybe influence them a bit.

The Universim gives you this, but with the caveat that it's only a very minor part of what you, as a ""god"", must do to keep your civilization alive.  This game pushes the edge of being simply a ""god"" game and moves more into the realm of actual city building.  You have to manage happiness and crime.  You place buildings and assign workers to them.  You plan out the research progression.  Basically you have to virtually do everything to manage your village.  As I said, less of a god game and more of a city / civilization builder.

While I admit, in Black and White there was also an aspect of construction management and assigning villagers to tasks, you didn't have to micro-manage your villages as much as you do in this game.  It seemed like villagers wouldn't do anything except basic labour tasks on their own.  If I left the area to go look at the rest of the planet I'd have to seriously worry about what was going on in my village while my eyes were off of it.  Believe it or not, that's actually what turned me off.

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there are quite a lot of people out there that would absolutely love this game.  For me, however, it didn't fill the niche I was trying to fill.  Simple as that.",1645405910,1645406033,False,7,0,0.554986894130706787,0,True,False,True

Most of the positive reviews probably haven't achieved the space age, realistically the campaign length is probably about 25 hours including the space age stuff, and a lot of the positive reviews are around 10-15 hours when the game is at it's best. This is a game that deserves a meh score. ""Mac Like-a The Potty"" summarises my thoughts well; The late game is a total grind.

The simulation mechanics aren't super in depth too and the mid-late game just gets really slow, turning from an interesting colony management game to just another mediocre city builder. I went the industrial instead of ecological path as in my opinion these sort of resource management games are better when you use non-infinate power supply system, essentially for the reasons the Satisfactory devs highlighted in a recent video that's something like ""10 features we will never add""

But the first 10 or so hours of this game were enjoyable. Definately worth playing over a weekend but not at all the $42AUD. The game's been in development a really long time too so saying ""It has potential"" seems totally redundant to me. I legitimately do not have any ill will against the developers here as it is clearly a game of passion although I suspect they are not the most experienced dev team in the world.

The game suffers from both an agonising dead end on progress where you're just sitting and waiting for new research to finish and a huge explosion in population where you're just building more of the same resource gathering structures to keep up with demand. There is nothing to keep you engaged once you've reached this point and your city has become so large with so many nuggets running around it's a real struggle trying to remember where you've placed what building where. The recent expedition update was nice, I liked watching the expedition team move through and seeing what items they gather and what events they encounter but the UI is pretty awful. You have to keep the expedition building selected to see new updates from your expedition team when a small collapsible window off to the side would mean I could keep track of their progress without having to find the building among the maze of a city that's been generated.
The biggest points in the games favour is it's aesthetically pleasing to look at with some nice little details on the world design. But behind this there is nothing to keep you engaged and make you want to press through to the Space Age except there's nothing else to do.",1643868109,1643868323,False,44,0,0.742833971977233887,0,True,False,True

-Relaxed city builder
-Cute and funny

Cons:
-Research. This is probably my biggest issue with the game. Researching new tech is the only real advancement in the game and it is tied behind static timers for each tech to finish being researched. This makes the game feel like it's on rails and I'm just here for the show. No reliable way to increase research times and really slows down the game sometimes, making if feel like a drag. 
-Excavation. So you can send you people on excavations to get mats but it just feels very out of place in a game like this. 
-AI. Can be really dumb sometimes. You rely on the AI to help you manage your city so it can get annoying.
-UI. Needs work. Some important things on the UI are literally just a dot on the screen. Makes it VERY easy to miss important things. The notifications can get very annoying as well, needs customization.
-Not enough Info. Example, you gather different kinds of food for your people (hunting,fishing,farming). No way to tell how much food you are gathering/using from each source. How can I tell what is more efficient?",1643825803,1643825803,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

But...

Of all the fun things in the game, all the small annoyances overtook the general feeling about the game and condensed into this:

I hate the UI and I dislike the water balance atm... come on, seriously, the absurd need to build a ridiculous amount of reservoirs that cover half the planet and still they drink dirty water? What about fresh water lakes and wells? I lost interest half-way through due to this unbalanced water issue as the sims have the reproduction rate of rabbits on Fenugreek, moments later I have two exile cities sending thunder storms at me (sure, kind of amusing, I guess, but I can't do anything against them if they're under a dome), hundreds of dead citizens from infections throughout the session and so on. The pop-up sounds are so annoying that it takes away the mood really fast, I feel like an administrator trying to save a burning wreck of a company yet my civilization is ""thriving"" since they reproduce so darn fast, so they're still around despite simply ignoring them after a while and just watch them build an ever increasing amount of homes.

The crime mechanic, is it really necessary? feels out of place and just weird, but then again I can see what your'e going for, and the need for balancing and pushing events but ... I'd be happy if there were watchtowers protecting my village from gigantic angry bears, and who wants to steal used leather underpants from your dirty neighbour, generally speaking? Or fruits or a ton of stone? Feels just... off, to me, unless you plan to develop types of governments, ideologies, philosophies and deeper mechanics of social interactions between the nuggets; that feels a tad bit overkill (or not, what do I know)?

The Galactic Market is not something I'll ever use again, as it is really confusing and poorly described; it's not explained properly at all IN-GAME imo, I'm not going to go meta and search forums, wikis, youtube and whatever just to find a single piece of information on how to properly use it and what to expect from it... never found wherever my deliveries landed as they're not at the warehouses either, so whatever, at least I don't have to hear and see that annoying sticky pop-up next time, deleted the save.

It was fun for a while, maybe I'll try it again in half a year, but no matter how much I wanted to enjoy it, that joy and excitement for a new and fun looking game I had when I first booted it up, it didn't last very long sadly. 

*Not* worth 20 euros, or even half of that since it is 1) incomplete 2) current content still needs a lot of polishing 3) didn't feel fun for me after a while despite loving these types of games, it just added more stress in the end which isn't something I need.

Put it in your maybe box, tick it for the wishlist and follow the development but don't put your hard earned cash into it just yet, but then again maybe you're more forgiving than me, and have a lot of more patience but I don't. If you absolutely want it anyway, buy it on sale.

Hopefully, it will become better balanced and more polished in the near future.",1643772636,1643772636,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The population auto-builds their own residential plots which would be fine but they seems to like doing it in areas that you're not expanding into leading to a services shortage until it becomes a resource shortage as you build them up, culminating in a space shortage as there's nowhere left to build in that area now. 
The people routing is infuriating, as they will go on treks across the globe to other parts of your city that have better and faster paths. This leads to them dying on the road, creating infection zones and then infecting the other people on that path, you spend most of your time at that stage zooming around carefully working on body disposal.
The need for water is far beyond what you will expect and even with reservoirs everywhere some will run dry while the ones a few feet away are full.  Want to open some menu that will show you why this is happening or identify other problems? too bad. Just build more I guess.

this has like the perfect blend between having control but also not having control if that makes sense? it has that level of control in the respect that you can choose what to research and build. 

But in the sense of having no control you cant really have unlimited use of your powers and you cant just force someone to believe in you, the belief system kinda reminds me of Black and White which is super nice and refreshing but it also doesnt restrict on how far you can build out which is nice.

Perfect Mix of Technology researching, Resource Management, and Keeping your nuggets happy.

Stone age feels the longest, once you break out of it you're in the modern age pretty quick.
Stone age is a little bit slow, but still fun. a lot of waiting.
Modern age you're constantly micromanaging, not a lot of down time.

Every single action your nuggets do is fully animated, everything has so much detail. you can zoom right in to get a close up perspective of what they're doing!

your nuggets have pretty convincing free will AI, they'll assign themselves jobs, and choose where to live. You can influence their decisions on what to build next over something else, but it's ultimately up to them if they feel like building that iron mine you want is the right move.

The narrator is mostly funny (Sometimes annoying) and the graphic style is nice. 
I got the game on sale price which I recommend as I think it is much closer to the games real value at this stage in the development. 

My only real annoyance is the running joke about peeking and ""what are you looking for there?"" and ""what do you expect to see here?"" etc etc ad infinatum every time a new baby is being made and the screen passes by them.

Bought this game and played up to the space era place holder a few times. 
What has been released is highly polished with great playful narration and it plays very well. 
Somethings you should know. I've had the game for maybe 2 years? in that time there have been zero updates. 
There is a frustrating place holder right where the game gets interesting. Unfortunately i expected more when i bought the game and so the game has mostly been collecting dust. Devs could do a lot better updating blogs and flegging out the missing content. It seems as if they've already been paid so why bother finishing the job? But that's the nature of early release isn't it? Why finish a game if the customers already bought it? All that being said when this game is finished it's going to be something unique and is sure to be an instant cult classic.

I’ve been a huge fan of God Games ever since I played the original Black and White when it first came out, so when I first saw the blurb for The Universim I was hugely excited.  And starting out this game looked like it had all the hallmarks of being able to live up to my expectations; procedurally generate world, decently powerful God Powers, meaty enough systems for you to theoretically really get stuck into and create a world that is uniquely yours.
The problems however start appearing quite quickly, and unfortunately they are both legion and pervasive. The huge one from which ever single other problem flows is that the longer you play the less gameplay there actually is. And I mean that in the most literal sense: The game wants to automate almost everything for you, right down to allowing the game to place buildings without your input. And I mean ALL buildings. And sure, you can just choose not to research or staff the building that starts this automation process, but you never have any control, or any choice to take over manual control of where residential buildings are constructed (short of deleting the foundation as soon as you see it appear). This leads to a loop where homes will often be constructed outside the range of your service buildings, which leads to you build more somewhere you don’t want them. And by the time they are finished guess what? More home are now outside the range of these newly built services which means you have to build more of the damn things with no consideration to what looks good or logical, only to what covers the most homes. This makes it impossible to create a nice-looking city with distinct areas like docks or industrial parks. Instead you are left with a slap dash looking hive with no sense or reason (which is NOT helped by the fact that even the roads are also autogenerated for you and resemble spaghetti dropped on a plate). And if you decide to automate this to reduce the tedium, and because it doesn’t matter where anything goes anyways for the aforementioned reasons, you are left with exactually two things to do: Click on research every time you que is done and watch it count down (since its on a strict time and requires no other input from you and cant be sped up), or cast the same god power over and over and over in the hopes that it converts enough of your villagers (called nuggets here) so you have a  high enough believer to non-believer ratio that you have a good God Power generation rate so you can actually cast god powers when you need to prevent a disaster. The one that could have been automated through the construction of temples or something somehow wasn’t. 
In short; its tedious in the extreme, unrewarding, borderline un-interactive in some cases and you are incapable of actually crafting anything that can be said to be uniquely you, which is half the damn point of a God Game. Which is a huge shame because like I said the systems are all in place for this to have been great.

To progress in this game you need to research, but research is this game is SLOW, even at maximum speed (x2). Expect 5-10 minutes for each research mid and late game. There is so much research that I was literaly watching a movie or two while waiting for the research to complete, so I could finally launch my rocket and end the game. Also, there is currently no way to speed up research.

Gathering resources is kind of slow, especially for advanced resources. You get like 1-2 per two minutes per full factory and you need hundreds of resources to build and upgrade everything. Also, want to upgrade 100 buildings? Good luck clicking them and upgrading them 1 by 1.

Some buildings, like basic houses, can't be placed manually. Roads can't be placed manually either. So you can't really plan a city because your citizens keep building houses and roads all over the place, making your city look like a mess. You can use the 'holy ground' God power to mark where your citizens can place their houses but to be honest that doesn't help much. You can't place a neat row of houses with a straight road next to them for example. 

There is no real combat challenge. Wolf and exile attacks can be amusing early game but even at maximum difficulty I don't even look at the warnings endgame because I rarely get attacked. When you do get the occasional attack it's so weak that it's not even worth looking at.  Spam watchtowers and build 2-3 barracks, wipe your enemy off the planet. No walls, no gates, no special units and no tactics involved.

You end up building a lot of the same buildings over and over again. More games have this, but this game takes it to the next level. Expect to build like 10 engineers hut, 10 water pump, 10 reservoir, a lot of eateries, shops and parks in a 300 citizen town. Not to mention you need cemeteries all over the earth to avoid infection completely. I think the effectiveness of those buildings should be increased so you can actually plan and build a good looking city

All things considered I think the game could be fun, but the developers are focussing on the wrong aspects of the game. Improve those research times and resource gains, make those enemies more deadly, add some depth to the combat system and allow players to place all buildings and roads where they want, instead of the npc's randomly placing them.  I hope that the finished game will be much better than this early access version.

My second biggest problem with the game is how fast the game starts introducing new eras. (this isnt really spoilers but if you want to go into the game fresh stop reading). When you start medieval age is when the upgrades start this stage you can handle but once you get into modern age they start introducing new items like steel plastics.etc which almost every new and old building needs. Due to this you will research everything then having to rebuild or upgrade everything, and you will just finish a steel factory and you will need upwards of 500 beams. With that said it is a very fun game which you can sink hours into and like i said my main problem might just be due to me being a bad player and managing things properly i still think its it great game with its flaws like any other games!",1621123963,1636084837,True,7,0,0.563176512718200684,0,True,False,True

I've read every update they put out. It was recently on sale and I thought I would go ahead and try not even knowing when I might try to play it. Well I'm at 13 hours now and I have maxed out the entire tech tree. The tribal phase is amazing, tons of things to do/learn and has some challenge to keep things going but once you get out of that it seems like things dwindle. The upgrade choices get slimmer and everything gets a bit easier. The biggest challenge at that point is making sure you have enough resources to afford what you want to do and it continues like that with a very slippery slope at the end. This game has a ton of potential but they really need to add as many choices and increase the difficulty as you continue to progress. I know they just added rival tribes so that could be something however at the moment they are no challenge at all. Anytime a new one pops up I just murder them before they have the change to get made at me. The most annoying thing for me at the moment is for some reason my roads are starting to disappear. I hadn't changed anything but they just decided that they weren't going to be there anymore so there are gaps in my city where people have to slow down to walk to the next section of road. It's pretty annoying to look at. Anyway, yes, I recommended as is if you need a little break and want to play a semi-city builder survivor. It has a lot of ""Spore"" vibe to it....I do wish you could maybe upgrade your creator powers...like maybe be able to make your force field larger or a bigger lighting strike that maybe turns into a storm. They could maybe supplement that for tech as you go on since things become pretty automated and that way they could also scale the difficulty of the rival factions so you can help your faithful nugs in battle!",1635988933,1635988933,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

2018:
Everything is controlled in the game. I as a player (where as it is advertised) have no free will or right to choose what the ""nugget"" (the population) to do or not to do. 

Basically: Wrong info / advertisement. 
I can place objects and it's up to the ""nuggets"" whether they wish to use it or not. 
For a ""God"" genre game, this game is lacking in all sorts of aspects, designs, coding and AI to be an actual ""God"" genre game.

This Genre is difficult I know. But as a dev-team / company you should know where the strength of your companies lies in. 

Calling it ""Become the ultimate empire in The Universim, a new breed of God Game in development by Crytivo."". As a word of advice, I would recommend to the devs to get their hands on B&W (2) before deciding / labeling their games a god genre game.

Only things I'd add is firestorms are ridiculously difficult to deal with after you've surpassed 100 population, and that the road system is infuriating, as it often doesn't leave space for things to be built while keeping a road, or it leaves a gap when building a road by hand would be useful. Also, the new 'Hyperlube' is terrible, as once you have an established city, there's no way you're adding a hyperlube to it, since it can't go over or through buildings, and it can't fit over a road without utter precision.

I'm loving the game. It has great mechanics and is a solid concept...BUT... some things have GOT to change:

Buildings require repairs CONSTANTLY. I have a ton of engineers (who repair buildings) and they do their job, kind of slowly. The biggest factor here is that EVERY building has a decay timer that feels to be around 10 minutes or so. I built a glass factory (which hadn't produced a thing since I didn't realize it took GAS(?) to make the glass) and shortly after it was built it ""Was in shambles"" or ""Was hanging on by a thread"".

Additionally, every time I start a new civilization, my nuggets (what your population is called in this game) end up starting a small foothold on the other side of some body of water, out of nowhere, and can't even be bothered to build wells. I help them out with that, and then a steady stream of nuggets begins to travel back and forth between both sides. People frequently die on this trek, and despite the cemeteries I have, they end up laying there long enough to spawn a pool of disease that then infects every other GD person that walks single-file around the body of water. No one can be BOTHERED to side-step the corpse (which is surrounded in black liquid and is covered in flies). This leads to 10-20 people at a time being infected regardless of how fast I react.

So, when these two WONDERFUL flaws are put together, I end up spending ALL of my creator points (kinda like mana, but you use it to cast God Powers) to clean up the infectious area, move corpses to cemeteries, and repair buildings. This ends in my utter frustration, as my buildings (which are obviously made of paper) crumble because my engineers are slow to repair things (I have about 10 of them, completely upgraded and almost fully staffed) scattered across my civ that JUST made it to the Victorian era.

Lastly, and this is a bit of a flavor thing, but why do I unlock electricity before I even have victorian building. I mean, My nuggets are living in stone huts, but their front yard has a big battery in it. They go to work at an oil pump or a concrete factor (which for some reason uses oil and bricks to produce concrete), but still visit the open-air witch doctor and open-air school. The progression just feels wrong. I know this is early access, so I do get the feeling that this will change in the future. At least, I hope that some day I'll be able to build bridges before I have access to electricity producing wind-mills.

To finish off, I want to thank the Crytivo team for their work on this beautiful game. The graphics are crisp and the idea is 10/10. The execution just has some issues that make playing feel like a chore. I look forward to the game's full release, and to see what you all have planned for the future of these sad (and absolutely idiotic XD) nuggets.

Edit: FORGOT TO MENTION....GOD FORBID A DISASTER SHOW UP...you won't have any CP to deal with it. Before the most recent disaster struck I was struggling to maintain my civs buildings (since the engineers are terrible at their job) and there were over 20 buildings in need of repair. NOW that the firestorm showed up, half my civ is on fire, and I can't do ANYTHING but watch. This feels ridiculously broken, and definitely needs to be fixed.

For the record, my nuggets love me, so my CP gain should be high, but its not, so I have to constantly throw nuggets into the grinder to be able to deal with problems...So really, the best way to play this game is to destroy your nuggets on a regular basis...",1593995295,1632427753,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

pros: Very relaxing, has some humor/wit, and is simple but complex enough that you can use some strategy. You can take 10 minutes to admire your work without it falling apart, but ultimately you are what drives things forward. Michael Schwalbe's voiceover is perfect and without it the game would lose a lot of its well earned charm.
cons: art is nice and resource light, but I want even more details in my digital ant farm. It's a learn by playing game, so if you don't like playing for a half-dozen hours only to find you overlooked something vital at the very start, this game will frustrate you.

The Universim is a god game where you lead your little nuggets through the ages and eventually into space, it sounds such an interesting concept but I have only ever known this game to be in Early Access. Development of the game is slow and I only hope that they at least continue to work on it to meet what the game is trying to do. *right now the game is laughably small*

I still give it a yes because if you happen to have the game, it's a fun game, though short in length. You can develop a planet and progress through the ages in about a day of playing it.

There are some bugs but nothing you can't fix by just loading an old save which is not fun but it is what it is.  There are also some weird quirks in the game that are just plain weird.  They definitely have some balancing to fix.  For one, it is weird that sooner or later your houses start to upgrade themselves into very tall sky scrapper like places and they are surrounded by old school brick and mortor stores and utilities.  Like my hospital and other buildings will be still in the stone age look and sitting right next to a home that is a sky scrapper with electricity and all.  The people auto upgrade but the other buildings don't.  That seems really odd in game. also the production rate is not as fast when it comes to other late game stuff.  Like there are balance issues when it comes to production and having the appropriate amount of people.  Also there are issues with the speed of production.  Some things don't get produced very fast at all.  Like you build a steel production building and you make maybe one steel or 2 a day.  Also the rate of death seems to add into the issues with keeping enough people to actually run buildings.  Also it seems people die of natural causes faster than people are having babies and reproducing.  Like they don't reproduce quick enough. There is huge timing issues.  Mid game, I got to the point where I didn't have enough people to run production.  And I had residential buildings going dormant that were once not dormant because the housing multiples over time and residential buildings go towards holding more and more people as the buildings advance but the people are not reproducing fasts enough to fill the other residential buildings.  So I would have a total of like 10 residential places that hold 1 to 3 buildings.  But then that one residential place will upgrade from 1 residential to say 5.  And now the people from one residential join the new better building and then that other residential building no longer holds any people.  The people don't multiply as fast as you would like and then you have buildings and businesses that no longer operate because you have no one to operate them.  There is also issues with other people taking up space and building on your planet.  They come and build supper fancy buildings real quick and then demand a ton of supplies that if you gave into would cut you down fast. 

It is a fun game but when you get to mid game you start to have a bunch of balance issues.  Balance with people, resources, creator powers, etc. It needs work but is a lot of fun.",1625942146,1625942146,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pretty great game, amazing concept, and super cool visuals. It's really satisfying to be able to help the nugget species survive and grow to power over their planet! 

That said, there is a bit I would change to elongate the process of the game and make it more fun :D

1.) The other tribal cities that rise in the game ought to be other variations of 'nugget', making them more alien than yours. This would allow easy visual of 'The Others' in the game, as well as provide another sentient race that you could help raise into friendly alliance with your Chosen Race, or wipe them off the planet in a super war.

2.) Nuggets ought to be more self-reliant from the very beginning, by option. It would be incredibly nice to be able to automatically have the ability that the Government building gives by granting Ministers over time. In this way, you would be less building everything for them, as much as guiding them and giving them buildings that they NEED right at that moment.

3.) Battles and Wars between Nugget Nations, the environment transforming due to what weapons are used! -- Your Chosen Nugget's culture influenced by your Faith!

After the last update I played this the whole weekend to unlock everything in the tech tree expecting to be able to go other planet and slav-- um, explore the other planets (as seen in the trailer) but apparently we are not quite there yet, but it's still enjoyable. Not sure if i like the latest update, it adds a quest and a building, but i don't think the tech reward from doing exploration worth the resources and nuggets spent. maybe for unlocking cars and speed boost but thats about it.

Playing this game with infinite divine power is super easy mode. Standard is good enough challenge with disaster on.
The exiled ones is agitating your city? meteor
Wolf attack? meteor 
Locust swarm? meteor
Riot? meteor
ghost and zombies? meteor
alien attack? they're lucky i cant aim at their planet.

Personally after reaching the end of the tech tree, i will wait for another quality update. If anything, things is a lot slower then what it used to be during launch. it actually takes time to reach the end of the tree and a lot can happen in between.

What i like:
+ graphics is cutesy
+ casual quests, could use a bit more challenge tho
+ resource management is quite challenging
+ meteor

What i don't like:
- end game is meh for now
- core exploration
- automated road building (please have players be able to build their own)

In short, i would still recommend this game even it is still missing end game components, it is a fun god game/city building/resource management/life sim game. i'm just not sure if i want to play this again before the next quality update.",1622636410,1622636410,True,11,0,0.659386754035949707,0,True,False,True

If you're looking for a god game, that makes you actually feel like a god? This is it, I have wanted to play a god game like this since I was a kid. Too summarize its like Black and White from old, but you only have very little control over the nuggets in general, instead you try to guide them through time. The only caution I have for you is, you need to understand the nuggets run under a ai, You have to be willing to accept that. ""Think like a god"" if you can do that, please give this game a try. This dev's have truly made something special here
and deserve to be rewarded in lots of sales, and there not even done yet!

Even though I only have 5 hours at the time of this review, and it is the first ever early access game I have ever bought. I know it will only get better from here, that's why I'm giving Universim a 10 out of 10.

The game certainly is an interesting take on a god simulator. Faceless peeps you have to care for and manage. Aid and Protect or Punish and Terrorize. 
The skill tree is somewhat balanced, yet I wish the water system had better and earlier upgrades. Winter is a pain to deal with early on, all the lakes and water pumps freeze. So you have to spend your creator points to sustain their reservoirs. Which you can't build enough of before first winter, because it takes so long for them to build just about everything. Oh and lord help you if there is a fire. The firefighters are all kinds of useless, have to run to a water source to get water, by the time they come back the fire has engulfed every nearby building.
Universim has the same problem City Skylines has, at first things are easy to maintain. But when you reach the time to expand, things go haywire. Peeps and services can't get to where they need to be or it takes forever for supplies to arrive. I don't want to be mean but come on, the windmill and wind are just shite. It is either too windy or no breeze at all, so no power for anything. A player shouldn't need to have an articulate plan of construction and infrastructure just to enjoy themselves. 
I don't care for the crime system or the short range of police and watch towers. Also why does having the cemetery on cremation cause distress? Further more, why do dead nuggets cause disease? And why do healthy nuggets walk through them to get sick? Why are the nugget creation perks so unbalanced? The longer I play the more I start to question things.

The key problem is that there are no interesting decisions to make. Its just a game of doing things for the sake of busy work.  Most of the ""quests"" are simply use god power X on object/person Y.  That is it.

There are no game-play puzzles to solve.  Just build more farms for food, build more water to solve thirst problems.  Just do what is the most obvious thing to do and you will be fine.

The narrator of the game is fairly repetitive and annoying.  For example every time the camera moves past a hut where two people are making a baby, the game will comment about the fact that ""Should you be watching this"".

Also, why is this game called the Universe Sim?  You manage ONE colony of people on ONE planet.  Never mind commanding several star systems let alone several galaxies.  If you were creating entire galaxies, filling them with planets and civilizations from a god perspective, then that might be a Universe sim.  But no, you just spend your time healing people and moving rocks and putting out fires with your ""god"" powers.

This game has been in EA for several years and from what they have delivered so far from a game mechanics, its clear they have no real talent in game design.  Someone wanted to make a god game (which is fine, since these kinds of games are so rare), but they failed to do anything interesting with it.

Watch a Lets Play of this game.  Spend a few hours watching one and save yourself the money.  I would totally refund this game, but I played more than 2 hours, so I guess that's it.  I was really hoping something interesting would happen, but nothing ever did.   Also, why was I still in the stone age after inventing electricity?   The next age was the medieval age, when I really should have been in the modern age. Well its still EA so I guess they need to tune progression a bit.

Okay so a lot of my cons in the original review have been fixed. The Devs here have been really good about trying to work with what the player base wants. i had said before in my original review that the game has a close black and white feel to it. i feel thats a wrong thing to tie this game too its not as combat based as black and white was. I am however still heavily behind this and would still recommend this game in its current state. the game currently is complete up to the space age which from the videos i can tell the plan is once you are in space age to move your colony to other planets and such. this feature however is not there currently. god powers are much more balanced. and the tech tree is still open to researching different things just keep in mind the rate at which you research things changes how your nuggets needs will change but you can get to end game in just about any path though some paths will make it much harder but more fun


This is probably going to be the first and only time I write a review on a game. I felt it worth the time to put this out there though. now keep in mind where my gaming since is coming from i started playing pc games back in 1998 there was a game i really liked back from 2001 called black and white. this game has a very simular feel to this game which is why i plan to stay on board to see this game finished. 

Pros: besides my obvious one that it has a feel like black and white. the game play has some strategy to it and there are more then one way to get the same point. i do like that you can ( if you want ) remane every single nugget in your world. the devs are putting a lot of aspects into the tech/research that allows you to take a different path depending on what you feel is best for your nuggets ive started a few different games and tried the order of the research to see if it would make a difference and honestly it does depending on how you want to change your build paths.

Cons: Mind you i know this is in alpha, current build at time of review (v0.0.27) the game basically ends at about 8 to 10 hours of game play. a lot of current research still showing ""coming soon"" as its tag for showing what it provides when it still provides another upgrade. up until this build there was a problem with the autosave lag taking about 5 to 7 secs to autosave down to about 2 secs which isnt too bad but if it tries to autosave while im using powers it cancells out what i was doing which is a little annoying to deal with. the lack of geological god powers is a little bit of a problem although devs seem to be working on this one.

final say on it though is that if you want to try and work with the devs to build this out may be worth getting now and playing as things get better however in its current state not worth the price though the potential to be well worth it is their for sure im just hoping the devs dont give up on this one ive been looking for a decent black and white feeling game for a long time that was fun and a little more laid back and this feels very much like what im looking for",1539264931,1618166618,True,0,0,0,4,True,False,True

i would love for my nuggets to be more independent of me actually.
They will advance the techno tree on their own if you dont. i like that, if i am god, my civ should try and advance on its own. this could be linked to believers...
Thought Experiment:
 the more people believe in me, the more decisions i will have to make like tech, building, etc
so if fewer people believe in me, they will build buiding they think neccessary, make decisions in tech, grow their civilisation independent of me.

I mean, i am god right? that means deciding to not intervene is a decision i should have.

But this is not a God game. If you're expecting Black & White or similar look elsewhere. The closest idea of a game is a mobile builder game. You build something then you wait and some time insane amounts of time for the research to build something else. The events are too repeatable and at some point you will ALWAYS find some issues with your nuggets. Some valid examples are : Infection - The Cemetery(Same with the engineers, sitting next to the damaged buildings) folk do anything else rather than carry the corpse.  Radiation(Previously was fires) - You will mess a ton with the Trickle god power(rain) just to fix it. 

I really hope in the future they will work on the research tab. I'm playing this actively, but every time I want to start a new game I need to sit for another ~8 hours for research to complete and makes me wanna pass. 
I would also like control where my nuggets set their houses, as well, something to speed up research cause it is annoying.

If you like mobile building games, then this is for you. Other people stay clear, look for variants. If these issues will be fixed, which are glaring ones, I will probably change my review.

I love that you can set up little politicians once you start forming a government and they ACTUALLY do things. So, if you don't want the game to play itself, just don't appoint ministers.

even the old black and white 2 is better in any way.
as a simulation game, is boring, it has a lot of resources but does nothing interesting with them beside generating more resources.
It has only one map, and its the same linear strategy over an over.
MAYBE with the space age added this game will shine and be a good one. but i don-t have a lot of hope for it, and the devs seems to be taking their time.
i like the spherical view of the planet, but the map interface its weird, and sometimes clunky.

- Already more polished than most finished games.  Beyond just the gameplay and the visuals, the tone, humor, and aesthetic all are perfectly matched.  It's so well done it highlights a few of the aspects that must still be work-in-progress, though none actually interfere with enjoying the game: lack of background music during less-important parts, the voice actor occasionally referring to ""wells"" that have been integrated/replaced in-game with ""water reservoirs"", roads not quite aligning, etc.  
- Feels like they're still working on incorporating elements of the ""mid-game"" and interacting with the other ""exile communities"" that spring up, though some of that may be by design.  It almost feels like a less depressive FrostPunk; if you keep on top of things it can go almost too smoothly, while letting something get out of hand can quickly cascade into disaster.  There are also building types and elements on the tech tree implying more fraught interactions with ""exile communities"" than I stumbled upon, at least.  
- The notifications systems seem like they're still a bit in-progress.  The ""standard"" notifications are well-done and the history can be easily accessed, and I don't think I've ever had notifications have ""hyperlinks"" in them that take me to the problems referenced in quite this helpful of a manner (kudos to whoever decided to let you clicked the ""nugget's"" name OR the location of the Infection Site within the same notification).

If you want to follow the game development its worth a pickup but dont expect more than maybe 4hours of gameplay.

To start off with the controls are somewhat unintuitive (space bar didnt pause the game initially, for example. Not sure if its personal bias but that just seems odd to me), the camera is incredibly slow and awkward and only gets worse as you start needing to cover more and more area, especially because you lack a minimap to quickly jump around. It actually took me a bit to figure out how to use the powers, as the game doesn't explicitly tell you that you need to select one, hold ctrl, then click to use it. So while the learning curve regarding the controls isn't insane and you'll get it after 10-15 minutes, its weirdly steep for what this game is. Generally speaking this game is pretty bad about communicating concepts to you in general though, certain things are never made clear and you only find out by experimentation. I actually still don't know exactly what I'm buying on the black market because I haven't bothered to look it up yet. The ""diplomacy"" system with other villages is really weird and basically shouldn't exist, and holy shit why are fire stations in the defense tab? Why are cemeteries and engineers in the epicenter tab? Why are iron buildings in the resource management and not the manufacturing tab? And why the hell can't I place multiple buildings without closing the menu and why are there no hotkeys for this stuff?? Fuck 

A lot of folks have said that the narrator is really funny, I didnt find that to be true at all. I'm tired of hearing how one of my 300+ pops broke their arm, I actually don't give a shit thats why I built hospitals, stop bothering me. You too will learn to hate this Stephen fry wannabe after maybe an hour, trust me 

Speaking of auditory bothers, this game has the most annoying notification system I've ever seen. Why would you want to know every time your nugs hook up or dies? Fuck if I know, but boy does it tell you. And maybe there's an option to reduce these notifications and I'm just stupid, but the only options I found reduces them to just icons, which is equally annoying because buried within these notifications is stuff that you actually need to know, like your water minister placing 4 reservoirs right next to each other. There was also a notable time where I only had one windmill that was fluctuating between supplying enough power and not, and every time it would ping me with two notifications telling me there's a power shortage and I should build more generators, god that was awful, especially because they stick around for an unreasonably long time and its fairly finicky to dismiss all of them, especially as there's not clear all button. Idk, maybe this won't bother you, but it really did for me.

Oh the tech tree, a lot of people have complained about the tech tree, and theyre all right. It doesn't make a ton of sense chronologically, like why do you research wind power before flint knives? I dunno, but I guess thats how this universe works baby. There's also the problem of different eras design styles not really gelling because buildings upgrade at different times, so you'll have lamplit parks next to stone age houses, then down the road you'll have a Flintstones looking school next to a capacitor bank, its very weird. Also its based off time, the only way you can make it go faster is by electing leaders that have that policy and making your meat men happy, but its still agonizingly slow, at current playtime I'm only halfway through the tech tree and I feel like I've been going pretty hard. Also its a lot of +5% to XYZ type upgrades, so its padded pretty considerably, the interesting stuff is few and far between 

I did actually find the environmental stuff to be fairly interesting, like overfishing leading to extinction, overdrawing from water sources draining lakes, all good stuff, but its basically the only meaningful decisions you make. The God part stops mattering past a certain point, your dudes will essentially do everything for you and their lack of belief in you only hurts your ability to use the powers that you never really need to use anyway. I actually like the automation, but it would be better if it freed up my attention for something that was actually interesting, but I'm just stuck staring at stupid little giblet people running around and living their stupid little lives, not interacting with them except to tell them to built another eatery or some shit. Yeah, God wants a wendys over next to the chemical factory, snap snap. 

And thats another thing, it would actually be a lot more interesting if the civilization developed almost entirely on their own, with you influencing them along the way but not micromanaging them, but instead you're playing a worse version of banished while the narrator from the Stanley parable tells you how much you suck

Idk I won't go into anything else as most of the negative reviews go into it on the mechanics and resource progression more (and oh boy are they valid complaints), but this game just isn't it. It was interesting for the first couple hours but it overstays its welcome, and its priced WAY too high at the moment, I'd pay $10 for this tops after having played it. Wait for a sale or go play worldbox or something",1612163616,1612163616,False,2,0,0.508532464504241943,0,True,False,True

I though that maybe those reviews come from salty Kickstarter backers. You know, the guys that in April 2014 were promised the complete game at the end of 2015. Yeah, it is funny like that worked out.
There is no game - there is very light simulation. It doesn't really feel like your actions matter at all. The tech tree is same in every game, and quite narrow. Most importantly the speed of research is *fixed* and requires real time to pass. Research the tech, place new building (if any is available), wait another 10-15 minutes AFK for another research to complete. This is it - whole game loop.
The game is totally anachronistic. Stone TV might be funny, electricity in ""medieval"" era isn't. There is that weird behavior that with new tech old buildings might now require new resources to construct. 
Oh right, the God game aspect. To make it impossible to ""play"" the game AFK, the Nuggets will give you quests, 3 times in first 5 minutes of game and 10 times in whole remaining time. Of course they will be timed, and sometimes bugged, so You only get the failure notification. Or just never start at all. Of course completing them is awarded with achievements - so if you fail you have to try again in another playthrough. 

Of course I am joking, just load autosave, I can't force myself to ""play"" it anymore to complete my first game, I can't believe anybody would want to start another one.

Oh, forgot to say anything about narrator. I love to hear that lakes freeze in winter, every winter, for 20 years. The guy is not funny and tries to hard. Even more when he makes fun of you not knowing the mechanics that weren't explained. The same buildings are referred by different names in different places (hints, tech tree, build menu).

I've been playing this since alpha came out. Sure, at the beginning there were some graphical issues. Some of the mechanics did not work as intended, but that's the alpha all right. Now that it's in beta I still see some minor things to improve, but overall this is an awesome game. 
You build your civilization from the ground up - literally. And in a really biblical way, since you start with one hut and only two people on the entire planet. Guess the gene pool won't be very complex but whatever, you're the god here, so you allow it. You can influence your people in so many ways, it is a little overwhelming for the begginer. The amount of buildings, means to grow as a civilization is astounding. This is not a title for ""couple minutes of gameplay"" - next thing you know, it's been hours. And I love it. 
I hope the space exploration will be added soon, because every time a major update comes out your previous saves become unplayable and you have to start over again - not that it's a problem.

Raised an empire using hamster wheels to power everything that did not work to well, so i used a more ""bad for the environment"" technique. Once I finally got to the space age my population all died from lack of Oxygen due to pollution.  And only 1 clone remained to pick up the pieces and it was my Bob Ross Clone, he attempted to rebuild a simple fishing hut but was sadly killed by a tornado in the end. 

My only complaint is there is not enough of it, would be cool to have a couple more Era's like the Renaissance Era,  Napoleonic Era and the Atomic Era  just to fill in a few gaps as by the end of the game I still had a few medieval building next to my Mega Corp Cyberpunk buildings which looked a little bit out of place. 

Also the narrator is great, would love to have a bit more dialogue from him in the game to give me a little more ""guidance"", He reminded me a little bit of the narrator from Come Dine with me.

Very Short Version: Fun but very simple and not very challenging. Some glitching but nothing that broke the game. Really the basic point of this game is how you arrange the city, not doing well at it or winning. If you've never played a city builder and want something that's not going to make you angry because you can't figure out the hook that most challenging CB have this is a good one. to me it's worth a single play through, playing again would only be to organize the city differently, which a lot of people like to do.

Pros:
- Looks neat, as the technology grows the city looks better
- Easy play through, usually these games have a single or multiple challenging hooks that you have to figure out to keep everybody alive.
- The God capability to influence the health/life/keeping buildings alive is kinda cool, you can reign hell on your own people or other cities
- I'm not sure there is a way to fail, I didn't really pay attention and I never really hit an ""oh no!"" moment where I thought I'd lose the game. (this is also a con)
- Graphics are cool 
- Great beginner builder

Cons:
- Every one of these games seems to have a major end game ""killer"" where some natural element isn't balanced well and you end up losing all your citizens due to the glitch. This has that but doesn't seem to effect game play. I started getting toxic atmosphere (low o2) that was around the entire planet. The game blames it on you and gives you basically no options to fix it other than shutting down production. I did and it kept spreading. I looked it up and seems a lot of other ran into this, but again didn't kill off everybody so i just kept playing. 
- Second gripe is the icons in the building menus do not  explicitly match the actual buildings you are building. it's not a huge deal but it's overly generic and a little annoying. 
- The game is VERY simple coming from playing a number of other city builders, It's very linear in that you have build build you timeline in order to progress. In short it's the typical cheap phone app game in terms of how much thought goes into the actual game. They could have spent a little more time and added something that makes it a little more fun and challenging that aren't natural disasters. 
- The building layout is a little annoying, but not an issue. The spacing between buildings is odd and you have no control over where roads/paths are put and you have to build around them. The citizens seems to do their own thing. 
- Only glitches I saw not mentioned was there was some kinda funny language translation issues where every once in a while a pop up would be in Russian (or something similar) or would be a bunch of ???????????????????????
- Though glitching wasn't an issue I'm sure most of the cons would probably be defended by ""it's in Beta"" but honestly it's no excuse. I'm tired of slow development being used to make money off games. if it's free or super cheap that's different.",1609057069,1609057069,True,3,0,0.547426700592041016,0,True,False,True

I bought this game somewhere between ""early"" and ""slightly less early"" EA and expected a rather weak and empty promises progress type of EA.

In fact i am kind of bitter about that, as i myself have never reached further than around middle medieval age before a massive update hits and force me to start all over researching fire and primitive tools so my nuggets won't eat each other. But that's all par to the course of EAs.
It's an EA and i've already played it more than most other games attempting or pretending to be in the veins of this niche genre.

The developers are absolutely amazing, they are working hard improving performance and updating the game very often with massive updates and patches. The Universim has been evolving over a while now and it keeps getting the content promised and aspired by the community and the developers, these developers are very rare.

The game itself is a one many have dreamed would happen, a game where you rule humanity as God. This game is the perfect milestone and really is what many have wanted and waited for, and more content is still to be released.

However, much content is still lacked, it's in early access. There are bugs, there becomes a limit to what you can accomplish and it annoys the hell out of you when you build something but the content is not yet released for that building, such as the airport before. 

Overall, the developers are working extremely hard to fix bugs, release the content promised and improve performance massively. In their recent update, they improved performance by 120% which is amazing, I often had 40fps on a good computer.

If a building is selected for demolition there should be a high return on resources and if it burns down or something it should have a low return on salvaged resources. Also sometimes the nuggets don't build roads were you would like, there should be an option to manually create roads. I noticed that creator powers can't be used when the game is paused. That should be changed because you are playing god here and have the ability to speed up or slow down time.

Pros:
Engaging Gameplay
Lots of easter eggs and hidden features
Great soundtracks
Beautiful world with procedural planet generation
Constant updates
Good Humor

Cons:
Some performance issues late game

Fun, colorful, and entertaining, but at 6 hours in I've only now gotten my stone-aged nuggets to upgrade their reservoirs after several winters of them nearly dying of thirst. There is an odd flow to some of the research trees, for example, my nuggets knew how to make vaccines, use wind energy, and smelt iron... before they learned how to boil water to purify it or how to make their water stores wider. 

Though I do enjoy the game, it's god aspects are much more lacking than I expected them to be! The god interactions aren't nearly as charming as Black and White's were- it doesn't actually feel like you're touching the world or your subjects. You just feel like another nameless city builder who just so happens to be able to make lightening or plant trees.

I'm hoping once I get through all the ages and get to space the game really opens up, because while it is fun to play if you enjoy city builders, it's hard to really sit down and say that there's really anything super unique about the game. It sorta feels like you've seen it all before, and they don't really do it better or worse than any other game does. That makes it not very memorable, sadly.

edit: I also wanted to say that even though it's still pretty and fun, the UI is really it's down fall. everything is super tiny, hard to navigate, and there's a lack of any meaningful tutorial. I had to Google how to use the god powers when I first started because they didn't tell me how. There is SO MUCH room at the bottom, top, and sides of the game, yet they have the UI squuuished into the small corners and sue the smallest fonts possible.

edit edit: Well, I played a handful of more hours. I found you can stretch the UI in the settings, which is nice. But my opinions have changed a tad, in that I'm now 9 hours into the game and nothing really new has happened. It's just sort of an ant farm. Not only that, the population is starting to exceed my city's limitations and what they can produce in a timely manner. They run out of electricity, but now need steel to build new windmills, and to build steel you need iron and gas, which take a while to produce and only produce a few per minute, and also need electricity to run, too. So you sorta end up in this sloooow limbo of all your electricity gets drained, then when it replenishes for a few seconds they have a short window to make things, and it just really takes forever to get anywhere... I finished the research tree and suddenly 80% of my buildings have an ugly icon above them needing to be upgraded. But its hard to find the desire or time to upgrade them when you need to build new things- your new buildings need those materials more than old ones, leading to a large portion of your city that looks like outdated, inefficant garbage, and the other part of the city are slow-building factories waiting on materials.

 I still think there are UI issues, namely in how you search and sort buildings (would LOVE some way to easily find buildings being worked on and that need upgrading, ESPECIALLY when you have like, 100 buildings!), and how you can't get rid of the annoying pop-ups that happen every second. At about 500 citizens do you reeeeally need to know every time they get married and have babies? It just floods the right side of the screen and makes a little noise **constantly** because there are sooo many citizens doing things. Weirdly enough, you can turn off notifications for the important things, like citizen death, but not for useless ""they got married"" messages... would I still recommend? I guess. It's pretty fun the first time, and the first few hours in. But after 9 hours I can't find the desire to want to play it anymore. It doesn't seem to have much re-playability, either.

1. Bugs. Some are minor graphical. Some are a nuisance that wont go away.

EDIT: Feels more like a city builder rather than a god game. Fine for me, but its off-putting that they're selling it as a god game when its really not. Thematically there's a lot of god related stuff, but it doesn't mean much as your civilization doesn't progress without constant hand-holding (building everything). God abilities surprisingly don't really matter aside from defending against the outcasts. Actually it's more accurate to say this is a civilization building game, not necessarily a city builder. In comparison to past god games, the Universim just pales in comparison. When Universim gets to its meat of content, the space stuff, maybe it'll be truly unique.

I would suggest and hope that this game has more content for every ages, yes, but expand the future age (end game) with more interesting and challenging stuff. Say like space stuff like fleet, exploration colonization of course, and more tech tree of this area. Surprise us DEVS! :D

But there are some issues with this game's management part. For example. The Lack of Laborals (workers) and FOOD SHORTAGE. After reaching certain progress and population, these issues, especially the FOOD SHORTAGE one will be almost impossible to be addressed. 
I already try from scratch two civs. The first one i had a bunch of garrisons, a few farms and fishing pier. Around reaching almost 400 of population, the food was already declining very fast. Maybe animal extinction? Never saw a message about it, so im guessing not. By the second time i did my civ i have had build A LOT of farms, A LOT of fishing piers, and many garrisons. For most of the time it was not a problem but when i reach a population of 500 the FOOD was declining very very fast. I never stopped queue to build more food rss buildings
As for that comes to the issue of the workers. The construction queue was really slow. Despite the population and rss. What ""kind of helped me"" a bit was to trade rss with the neightboring civs while i tried to build more rss building. But it didnt last for long.
So i think its a bit messy when it come to management. I think that maybe auto assign should be improved?
I think there is along the rss production numbers that should change and improve.

Also for a little extra. The water reservoir. I manage to sustain water for my civ no problem. But, as you expand your civ, and you just place the water reservoir in just one place like i did, it will cause problem for those nuggets that are far away. They will still drink water from the lake, therefore be sick.What i did to fix this was to build one or two water reservoir at every certain distance. 
But imo, i think there is no need for this to happen. Shouldn't be like as when they go back to their home or go to work they can just drink there like in real life? It is just funny how they just stop working to walk at a distance to the reservoir to drink lol. At least from the modern ages. Like adding the plumbing tech.

Idk, it just feel that the managing part needs general improvement.
And of course i know this is beta stage which is why im saying all this issues that imo need to be addressed and improved since i like this game a lot.

I hope this is helpful for everyone and especially the devs.",1603962927,1604992439,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

The first hour or so you have a great time, once the civilization is big enough the amount of micro management expected from the player is insane while at the same time everything takes an eternity to be made, seriously some times it feels like you are playing one of those mobile phone gamea that make you wait hours for something to happen, a problem that in part comes from the fact that you can research things faster than what your supply chain is allowed to sustain so everything slows to a crawl, couple with the fact that if you research technologies that affect your buildings they actually need better materials to be built and if you dont already have said materials you are out of luck. So if your existing buildings brake (as they often do) you can essentially sabotage your own progress by progressing too fast and kind of soft locking yourself because you can't get the materials needed to replace them. 
Not to mention the fact that the ""god"" part of the game which IS the selling point of the game is pretty lackluster and you end up using one or two powers at most which in turn are pretty underwhelming, so it plays out more like a generic city building simulator with all the above mentioned problems.

This is alright game to play. I look forward to all the bug fixes. Devs have been working harder to fix bugs. 

Its a real drag getting a population of about 300 and about 3 different building cause virus to break out every 5 mins or so. Hospital, Farm and University. (I'm still having problems with virus killing my population)

You constantly have to deal with fire and tornadoes and the warning alarm on your warning tower is so annoying I have to turn off my sound to play it. (This Bug has been fixed)

2.We hope to be able to plan roads freely, if it workable, please add the option of road construction in the construction options of the menu.

3.Please open the creative workshop module of the game, which will greatly enhance the playability and fun of the game.

4.The civilization development of the game is not sustainable in terms of energy development and resource utilization. It is recommended to increase the number of resources on the planet appropriately and add super engineering building options that can permanently solve the needs of the development of planet civilization and recycle resources.

5.Please set up richer game difficulty adjustment options for players, such as total planet resources, planet size, number of tribes and friendliness, alien invasion frequency, etc. (We want to be able to modify the numerical value of the planet)

6.Regarding the upper limit of God’s ability points is too low and only 1000 points, it is recommended that the game developers of this game change the upper limit of God’s ability points according to the difficulty of the game. Personally suggest that it should be increased by 5 to 10 times on the original basis (personally).~

7.When the game civilization broke out in the global epidemic, the capacity of the original hospital could not handle the huge number of patients. In order to consider the possible disaster, how can the original 6 people in the hospital increase to 9 to 12 people?

8.In order to make the game more fun, it is recommended that game developers add some new incidents about diplomacy or negotiation between two different tribes or two different interstellar civilizations on the same planet; you can specifically refer to surviving mars or stellaris

9.In terms of night city lights, I don’t think it’s gorgeous enough. For specific reference effects, game developers can refer to simcity: cities of tomorrow, or A-train9 (Of course, if you have a better night view light rendering reference, please note , You can also ignore the two reference samples I mentioned before)

10.Please increase the capacity of the school and cemetery (it is recommended to increase the student capacity of the school to 12)

11.It is recommended to add a new residential building style, the repetition rate of tall buildings is a bit high

12.Please improve the power generator plan, it is too primitive to rely on human power to generate electricity

I thought it would be just another black and white copy, but I was very wrong. Despite a similar nature, the game plays completely differently. Unlike Black & White, you don’t have to fight against enemies, but you still have to utilize your god powers in order to help your Nuggets strive and progress forward. You have to help them to survive. Wolf attacks and different disasters will constantly remind you how cruel the planet environment can be and it will keep you busy for quite some time. As you start the game, you will have to manage very precisely every aspect of the game but as you progress forward, a lot of things become autonomous and will require less time and effort, so you can shift your focus towards other issues that have a global impact.

There's also a recent addition of allowing players to customize their starting nugget's physical traits and skin tone, so allows for players to be able to represent themselves better.


I picked up Universim after seeing it demo'd at PAX South this year. The concept behind it is fantastic, god game, hearken back to the roots of games like Populous and the other God Games like the Black and White series of the oft-maligned (and entirely deserved) Peter Molyneux. While the bones are here, and good bones they are, the early access nature of this title so far leaves a lot to be desired. The promise of taking a civilization from a near biblical first pairing to a society that exists across the stars is a heady promise, but so far just a promise.

The Pros:
-Funny dialogue
-Gridless building system
-Already robust tech-tree
-Cute characters, animation, and graphics style
-God powers make you feel sufficiently mighty

The Cons:
-The tech tree is unfinished and progression is jarring
-There is no room for the morally ambiguous god, either you're good or your evil.
-Urban sprawl becomes a major problem in the current late game
-Environmental effects are inconsistent and lack realism
-Lack of conflict and story content
-Lonely


 	The game's humor is on-point, from the sarcastic dad narrator to the intentional misspellings throughout much of the game's menus and text that suits the off-kilter and quirky nuggets, the people of this universe, well. Some of the jokes do get old after a while, but for the most part this is some good stuff.

	There isn't much to say about the graphics style beyond it's colorful, cute, and suits the game's zoomed out look well. It does seem pretty blocky when you're in up close, but because of it's cartoony style this really doesn't look bad or anything.

	The building system in this game is already on par with a lot of the other current building games like Banished, and are all upgrade-able from the start to the end, so you won't be forced to demolish old structures that aren't useful anymore. Which leads me to the tech-tree, which is already fleshed out with enough technologies to keep things interesting for hours, there's always a new building to build or a new thing to discover.

	Unfortunately you do eventually run out of things to build, and the tech tree is still woefully incomplete if the game will even offer traveling beyond the original starting planet, which you are definitely stuck on for now. Also, your civilization eventually becomes one giant monolithic city. Your civ radiates out from a center point and there's little reason to not just continue building out from this, from a design aesthetic you civilization ends up becoming half the planet is developed urban sprawl and the other half is open wilderness. 

	The way buildings change is also jarring, one moment you're in the stone age and then all of a sudden everything switches to late medieval/renaissance Tudor, and then to futuristic concrete and steel skyscrapers. It'd be nice if the progression was a little less jarring, but then on the other hand if they want to get to space I suppose this sudden, dramatic shifting of the ages makes sense to a point.

	Your home planet is basically earth, by the way, which is a shame because the opening cinematic opens on another planet that is decidedly alien, with purple soil and strange fantastic creatures that I'd love to see more of. Not that you'd get to do necessarily anything but hunt them. The game's wildlife so far is very simplistic, there are very few types of animals on the planet and the only interaction you have is to either hunt them, or in the case of the solitary wolf-like predator species, be hunted by them. Otherwise they're just pretty set pieces, I haven't even really bothered with hunting because you get all the food you need by just farming.

	When it comes to phenomenal cosmic powers most of the basics are already here. You don't have a zone of influence like the old Black and White games so as long as you've got enough of the in game faith-based currency you can affect any part of the world you want to. If you want to pick up one of your nuggets that's angered you and put him on the other side of the planet to starve to death before he makes it home, you can. You control rains, fire, you've got a cupid-like ability to make characters fall in love, so far just opposite genders, no gay marriage or rights so far in this game. 

	As an aside, just the two genders by the way for people who were wondering how inclusive the game is. There is definitely zero to no-focus on representing LGBTQ in any way, or even race, all the nuggets are all little white people too. This isn't necessarily a scathing assessment on it's own,  the game's focus is on larger things than our current societal issues but it does seem a little weird that there's just one type of nugget, changing skin colors and having a more diverse populous wouldn't be too dramatically difficult on the part of the developers, especially with the very simplistic but effective art style.

	Anyway, back to the god stuff. You've got a bunch of cool powers, but I'm still struck by the things you don't have. Beyond fire, all of the natural disasters are controlled by the game, no floods or hurricanes, and the Tornadoes that attack your civilization periodically seem to have no internal logic at all beyond a countdown that appears when you build a structure for you nuggets to predict the weather. This also seems to be the only weather implemented in the game right now, as well, normal or extraordinary.

 	Crytivo promises earthquakes, meteors and other disasters eventually but hasn't implemented them, and based on the tornadoes they aren't going to be controlled by you, you know, the god running this planet. You also can't morph the terrain at all or do anything except use rains to fill up the slowly dwindling lakes on your planet (because if it it's not you right now, it's not raining at all, and your nuggets need water like no other damn resource for some reason)

	But the tornadoes are one of the few things right now that cause any conflict at all for your civilization. Because that's it, your civilization. There are no other nuggets in this world with conflicting ideas or their own gods, aside from a few early game animal attacks that seem to quickly cease the only stakes so far is if part of your mega monolithic city gets damaged by a tornado. 

	Which leads to my final complaint, is that the game feels lonely. Despite having hundreds of these little nuggets after a while your purpose and direction inevitably peters out, and the game gets, well, boring. Which hopefully is just a symptom of the early release nature of the game, more content is being added all the time, and what they have is impressive so far. This will be a game to watch over the coming year, and if it gets fleshed out more I'll certainly change this review to Recommended. Until then though, unless you want to support the studio and their development (which is not a bad thing, heck it's why I bought the game), I would wait until more of it get's fleshed out.",1551471263,1603329641,True,0,0,0.481501579284667969,2,True,False,True

A very long time ago I heard about The Universim and I was a bit skeptical about it and if it can actually meet my expectations after B&W. I was hesitant to buy up until now. Recently, I watched their Stream about their future plans and where the game is heading and after it I decided to give it a go and WOW! I was actually amazed. The Universim exceeded all of my expectations. The art is beautiful and vibrant. The world is live and it is a pleasure to watch your people (they call them Nuggets), how they do things and be involved in their lives. The core gameplay revolves around building your city and expanding your civilization. You have to help your civilization to evolve through ages by using your god powers as well as your strategy and economy skills. Unlike B&W, the game has a slower pace at start but it picks up later in the game. Soundtracks are amazing. I love them. The game is still in Early Access and I encountered a couple of bugs which are not critical, but they still exist. The game has a lot of mechanics and small things that can be missed during your first playthrough, but it is exciting to constantly keep finding new things in the game.

Some aspects of the game do get annoying however, especially in the late game - mainly the notification system rang almost constantly after I've reached a population of 600+ letting me know about every death and every time a nugget got sick. 

It would also be helpful if cemeteries had a much larger radius as countless nuggets seem to die outside town boundaries. This happens when nuggets forage in the wilds even though I don't feel like there's any need for them to do so. Perhaps it would be helpful to be able to turn off nuggets wanting to go outside of town boundaries in the game menu.",1603112124,1603112124,True,5,0,0.590483605861663818,0,True,False,True

At first glance, this game promises a ""Black and White on a grand scale"" experience, but it suffers from a few issues that prevent it from reaching that potential.

1) Buggy manipulation.  I can't count how many times I've gone to pick wood or stone up with the intention of dropping it on a job site only to click on a subtly wrong location, causing the object to crush the in-progress building (destroying it and refunding no resources) and to crush a worker (which then causes a sarcastic quip to play from the narrator - adding insult to injury).

2) The tech tree doesn't communicate what resources new versions of buildings need.  This leads to a repeated problem with researching more technology than your supply chain can handle, and suddenly your dudes are dying because you can't make any more of your fancy new water pumps without a resource that needs water to make.  And building your old pumps isn't an option anymore - they've been replaced by a ""better"" version that uses completely different resources.

3) The pace of gameplay goes back and forth between painfully slow and too fast to react to.  Normally the game absolutely crawls along and the 2x maximum game speed feels extremely slow, but then an emergency can blip by before you realize what's happening.  A higher max speed and some auto-pause on event options would be really helpful.

4) The powers aren't super fun, the power points trickle in, and there's not a lot of reason to use them for a good chunk of the game.  When you suddenly have a need for a shield the 15 points can be unattainable because of the slow rate of generation.  I'd recommend offering more ways to generate power points, or ways to increase the rate of generation.  The addition of major persistent threats could help give more reasons to use powers - black and white approached this by having other gods with avatars that you fought against but even having more active wildlife or more antagonistic civilizations could give more reason to use powers.

I really like the artstyle, and I like the promise of a god game that can operate on a planetary scale, but the game I'm playing now just isn't shaping up to be fun and fulfilling.",1603074317,1603074317,False,23,0,0.724947035312652588,0,True,False,True

A lot has improved in that span of time, making the game much more playable.  There's currently a decent framework for a great game, and I can see that the devs are clearly working very hard at it, posting monthly updates, but it still does need a lot of work if it's to hold my attention for more than handful of days.   I believe that at some point, hopefully closer to the actual release, my review will change a lot, but frankly, for now, I don't recommend it unless you're willing to be a very attentive and loyal beta tester, which is something for which I have neither the patience nor the attention span.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[b]Not enough gameplay yet.[/b]
I'm about 25 hours in and I've gotten through about 3/4 of the research tree.  I like that the research times are relatively short, so doesn't feel like Farmville or anything, and I like that research just happens in the background as you play so it doesn't become like early Rimworld where you're wrestling with a Pawn to force them to do necessary early-game research.  Still, I even with all the work the devs have clearly done on the research tree, I still think it could be larger!

[b]Forget about getting attached to your Nuggets.[/b]
Very early in the game, there's a quest to rename two of your baby Nuggets.  You might think that it'll be a good idea to occasionally name your Nuggets.  But soon enough, Nugget birth will be out of control, and they'll be popping out with names like Tity or unpronouncable, unrecognizable names with lots of Qs and Xs, and you won't be able to tell them apart anyway.

[b]Nuggets are very stupid.[/b]
I mean, this one--I gotta hand it to the devs, because the narrator does mention this quite often.  But as another reviewer summed up succinctly, they'll walk through plague like it's a field of flowers.  The gravediggers never keep up with dead bodies; frankly, I don't even know what they do.  Nuggets'll build many new homes instead of cohabitating, wasting a lot of space.  They'll go into burning buildings whenever they want.  They can't go out and find their own food.  I don't think hunters work and the game doesn't give an automatic tutorial.

[b]There are a lot of things you're better off Googling.[/b]
The game gives a few tutorials, but doesn't ever quite explain enough.  In fact, for some things, if you press the ? in a building's tab, it brings up text that simply instructs you to ""read the Wiki"" with no link.  Like...I pressed that button because I wanted an explanation, not because I wanted to have to tab over to another app for 10 minutes and do my own search.  No thanks.

[b]Belief is hard to come by.[/b]
Because of the lack of tutorials, by mid-game, I'm running super-low on Creator Points and don't really know how to get more Nuggets to believe in me.  Once every few hours, a quest pops up to gain me a single believer, which hardly seems worth the effort.  For most of the game, I've struggled to maintain even 1/3 of my Nuggets as believers because they die so quickly, and even wasting Creator Points trying to make them happy or energized doesn't seem to make them want to believe.  The game doesn't explain this stuff at all.

[b]Natural disasters will wreck your town.[/b]
The game explains very little about natural disasters and how to protect your Nuggets against them.  It also doesn't explain the little treasure boxes until you've opened one and lost 200 precious creator points out of nowhere or infected a third of your nuggets with the plague.

Honestly, I'm just kind of tired from writing this review haha.  I'll return to this game someday, but that'll probably be in a few more years.  I wish the devs luck.  I'm rooting for you!!  I want to love this game!  I'm just not the right kind of person to be testing it.",1602653530,1602653530,False,52,0,0.751654684543609619,0,True,False,True

UPDATE! 2020 FEBRUARY
Since our review over the holidays, it is official, UNIVERSIM has gone BETA!
Still waiting for the Developers to reach out to us.. we have so much feedback when it comes to streaming elements, but they have been so busy prepping for the BETA run and here it is!!!


2019 Dec Review;

In our first 3 hours invested in the gem of an Alpha, soon to be Beta planet simulator, we have discovered so many things that make this game outstanding, that we do not know where to really begin.  In good manner, we must provide you with so many attributes that The Universim delivers in which the name and fantastic game play does not covey in a fitting tale, as it is NOT just your ordinary Planet or Sim game..

Read on.. and feel how amazing this journey really is....

First, it is a planet simulator... and a civilization simulator, and a universe simulator... all with a pulse and God complex.
Second, it has direction, creativity and immersive elements, combined in a way with hilarious dialog, which adds a whole new element and depth.

Third, the artwork, sounds, and unique execution of controls, research, guidance and creativity is at your fingertips to teach your planet dwellers called ""Nuggets"". Over time you teach them how to move, act, and evolve on their own, with the occasional assist or reminder as a God here and there. Ever play Black and White... well that was fantastic at its time and this just takes that idea.. up a whole notch and to new heights.

Lastly, this game has numerous planet biomes to tackle as you move along as well as challenges of weather, accidents, animals, discovery, adaptation, and global catastrophic events.

In short, this game that plays extremely well in Alpha, and is about to be Beta in a short while, as you get your panties in a BIG BUNCH, because we can not wait to update this review and show you the making of a bountiful and beautiful planet, flourish in catastrophe. In IcewaterCreek® we trust... or did we?

Did we say the writing and narration of this game comments on your actions or lack thereof teaches you, and taunts you on many levels through your journey... oh... we should have. Put on a fresh pair of panties... it's gonna get messy!

Which would be fine, except that you still have these God powers, and the game forces you to use them every 60 seconds or so by finding a building which is on the verge of collapse, and repairing it before it is completely destroyed.

The other powers include the ability to boost the happiness of all citizens once per 5 minutes or so, which also becomes another chore that you have to do every 5 minutes to get optimal effect.  The cost is minimal so there's no reason not to cast this spell if you're able to do so, it's just a matter of watching the clock.

All other powers are basically pointless, except the ability to help your citizens build by dragging material to their structures.  You can also make your citizens mate, but finding a pair of opposite-sex citizens who are not involved in crucial tasks and physically dragging a line between them is not a fun exercise.  

I believe this game could be helped by actually removing the god powers and focusing on the city builder aspect, which is pretty good at the moment.  Citizens are smart enough to carry out their tasks without being micromanaged, with the exception of the aforementioned building repair -- you will need to hold their hand for that.  Houses and roadways autogenerate themselves, which is a nice touch, and other buildings can eventually be automated too as you unlock technologies. 

There's not much in the way of realism though.  Research happens at constant rate the background and you have little control over it: you select the next 5 technologies to unlock, and it tells you when they will be unlocked, but none of your citizens are actually involved in carrying out that research so there's no way for you to expedite it (save occasional bonuses from your leader's policies or from keeping your citizenry happy).  There is a seasonal cycle, and winter is especially challenging, but it's not because your citizens freeze to death or run out of food: it's because most of your buildings, even in the Neolithic age, require water to operate, and all bodies of water freeze over in the winter, so you have to stock up ""reservoirs"" of unfrozen water to keep them running.  Note that this mechanism is entirely separate from the game's thirst mechanic: your citizens also need water to drink, but they satisfy that need exclusively from wells, which do operate in winter and are not connected to the water wheel / water reservoir system.  This is...an odd choice, to say the least.

On the positive side, the narration and (scripting and voice acting) is amazing, and it has a beautiful intro.  The first ~30 minutes with this game is quite enjoyable.  But I do not recommend it in its current state.",1601882716,1601882716,False,4,0,0.517736315727233887,0,True,False,True

Buildings sometimes look very similar even after you start upgrading them, especially if you're like me and enjoy playing while having your view point a little bit further back, and when winter comes it's hard to tell heads from tails.

++The game is beautiful. It is very appealing to look around and fly above the planet. Buildings designs, animals, nuggets all look unique and very attractive.
++Gameplay. It is a city builder game with Era Progression and utilization of god powers in order to help your civilization. I like the progression and watch how my city starts in the stone age and slowly evolves through the era.
++Narration. The narrator in the game is very funny and it fits the god game
genre. Reminds me of the movie Bruce almighty.

Cons:
-- The game is still in EA, which means some bugs slip through. On a bright side, new patches with new content coming out on a monthly basis.
-- Performance. Once you hit the late game, the performance can be an issue, unless you have a good computer.",1597926545,1600889670,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You are playing a god, whose purpose is to help your Nuggets to get through the Ages and survive. As you progress forwards, your planet is slowly running out of resources and eventually you will have to send your nuggets to Space. The game has smooth gameplay mechanics and pleasing to your eyes graphics. As a god, you can create different disasters, pick up your nuggets or any other living creature and toss them right into space. There is a lot of freedom in the game and how you can play it.

As long as the developers cut no corners and deliver every functionality they can imagine, this game will be #1 with no competition.

Even at it's Alpha state, this game delivers hours of entertainment. The current version has a lot of promise of what is to come and I can't wait for updates.

Edit:

It seems the focus for this game shifted away from a god-game towards a civilization-sim to the games detriment. I must admit that my (and others') requests for additional functionality may have inadvertently led Crytivo to fixate on the superfluous details of civilization-crafting, and stray from the foci of god and god-crafting.

The game now feels like I'm playing SimCity or some such. Whether or not Crytivo can reclaim this game from the lousy advice column that is its discussion page remains to be seen. After half a year of updates in the wrong direction, it seems like this game is headed for the dustbin.

2nd Edit:

This game is a dead end. The developers are more concerned with scraping the bottom of the cash barrel than developing a game. The game hasn't left early access and a recent patchnote suggested they might make a Universim 2. That portion of the patchnote seems to have been deleted, rightly so.

Crytivo Club? Just another 3rd party subscription service that locks away game content unless you turn your purchased product into spyware that collects, shares, and monetizes your every move without your compensation.

The game itself plays a lot like tic-tac-toe, the whole game is determined by the first move.  Your only challenge is whether or not you placed your buildings properly.

There are also numerous spelling errors in the game, some are so stupid that it actually breaks gameplay. For example, the Townhall building has a setting for auto-assigning nuggets to jobs. The display for this number says the number represents, ""nuggets that SHOULD NOT be auto- assigned."" However, the pop-up description for the buttons which increase and decrease this number say, ""increase/decrease nuggests that SHOULD be auto-assigned."" Which is it? This confusing typo has been an issue for a long time.

What I dont like but is fixable, is the Narrator.  He sounds like a creepy camp Counselor.  Fortunately, he can be turned down to zero..otherwise, I may not have continued for long!
What I dont like,  ( and its just minor complaints) is the disasters, and how you cant click on the message to find the problem. Like the missing child, locusts etc.  You have to pan around until you find said problem. It would be nice to be able to turn them off or down but I get it...it is part of the experience.  Its about life and death.  I will add on a positive note that the disasters are pretty unique, unlike anything I have seen in a builder before ( barring the normal bad weather stuff ).
Lastly, the tech tree is funky.

It scratches the itch that both games did in the day, but does it on a grander scale, much like how Planetary Annihilation did for the Total Annihilation itch. It's a familiar genre at a larger, more complex scale. And so far, it's wonderful at doing that job. It also hearkens back to 22Can's original promises of Godus, but so far this game is actually delivering! The ingame narration hearkens back to the Advisors from Black & White, and really, the game as a whole feels like all the best parts of all the god and civilization building games of the 90s throughout recent times all stirred together in a huge cauldron with very little of the bad.

PROS:
- Very smooth and easy on the CPU, one of the cities from my current playthroughs occupied as good 30% of the planet at this point and despite having only a Geforce 1050TI, I'm still getting more or less solid 60fps.
- The narration that voices everything is for the most part for your benefit. The visual interface uses relatively a simple icon interface to indicate problems or benefits within your civilization as you play.
- Like many modern city builders, you have the ability to pause time and work in a less stressful environment when things start getting complicated.
- Interface feedback, such as being noted where related structures are when placing others of their kind (for example, select a well to place and locations of others are easily marked so you can position them more intuitively).
- Rotating and positioning things is fluid and buildings do not lock to invisible grids, so you are free to be freeform to a point - see below.

CONS:
- While camera control is decent, navigating around your settlements can be confusing as there is no apparent form of minimap or compass. When you need to find a problem in your civilization you might find yourself scrolling around your civilization trying to locate it if it doesn't have an associated problem icon, and when they do, they don't always show up if the problem is 'just over the horizon' in your camera view.
- While the narrator is fun and rather different and capable of being quite funny at times, it also tends to treat your simple mistakes or things that come up with a thick dose of mock pity, which is a bit of a turn-off. Comedy is a good thing, snark is best saved for political commentary made by late night TV hosts.
- In the early game, a road overlay that assumedly will be used later in the game (I have yet to get that far) is superimposed over the landscape whenever you build anything. I am assuming that once you progress to creating roads, they are built on these paths. But why can't we make roads where we want to make them? They run in unusual directions and, going by the footprints of many of even the smallest buildings, none of them properly fit into areas between roads without assumedly breaking the segments (by turning those segments red when trying to lace buildings). Also, when you place down a building, there's two sets of dotted lines surrounding the 'blueprint' before you place. What do these mean? One is obviously the footprint of the building itself, but what's the other one? Space for... sidewalks?

The game is still progressing much the same way as Godus was, from the past through to the future. I have high hopes for this and really hope it doesn't end up getting dropped, but Crytivo has a decent track record in my books and I'm confident that this will progress into something great. :)

You don't just sit around poking your finger at things or people waiting for them to react to what you do. You are a god and also active with the progression of buildings on the ground.

Transition through the ages and buildings take time and planning but nothing too complicated, the random events aren't that harsh besides maybe the heatwave when you have 20 creator points as it happens. I wont go fully in depth here as I care only about the feel and the core of the game as it presents itself to a new player. For it to suck me in for 5 hours the first time trying it as I didn't plan to play past the steam refund limit shows it's worth the price and the time.

Not all EA games I've tried recently with price tags higher than this or at the same feel the way this game feels at it's current stage in development. Replay value is very high even before you hit the final age. You could restart anytime and try to do something different with resource management or building variety or placements. You could choose a new way to gain believers by inducing fear or do both be a good god or a scary one.

I hope others feel the same way I do right now even if I am low in game hours currently but I plan to play alot more over the next few months over my other side games for city buildings or management type games.

This is one of those times I wish I could give a neutral score to something because the potential is clearly on the way, it just hasn't pulled into the station yet. The research trees and ages are something I adore in civilization-building games, the art is lovely and the narrator is a real treat! That said, there are... speedbumps. As I've played it, here are some tips for potential players:

1. Turn OFF the notification sounds. Oh, it's fine to hear those little beeps and bleeps when things start off and you only have a handful of dinguses running around. But by the time you've reached a triple digit population, those 'helpful' pings begin to sound like R2-D2 having some sort of anxiety attack. If this is what we sound like to actual God and He hasn't punted the planet like a kickball yet, I'm becoming a preacher TODAY because the guy has earned that respect!

2. Build graveyards within sight's distance from any point! Apparently nuggets see a corpse and think, ""Oh goodie, hopscotch!"" and sprint to it for the chance to get violently ill like some kind Nurgle fan club. You're going to be spending far more time than you thought possible trickshotting bodies into cemeteries. Oh, and you can't just bury them at sea either because apparently all it takes is one or two bodies to turn a giant lake's worth of fresh water into Jonestown Kool-Aid.

3. Have your paycheck direct deposited to Home Depot because, even with engineers, every minute you're not spending as a gravedigger you're going to be spending on repairing buildings that are apparently held together with bits of string and wishful thinking. These people don't need a deity, they need Phil Swift.

4. Observe your temple's 'puree' function! In this universe, being a corpse-hiding building contractor takes more than a decent organized crime connection, it takes Creator Points that will drain very quickly as more bodies and buildings start becoming a thing. And since your people can't be bothered to believe in you enough, despite seeing you float their grandparents off to a mausoleum and staple their roofs back on every hour of the day, you're gonna need to get those points somehow, so pick your least favorite nuggets (I prefer the ones who I keep seeing infect themselves with corpse juice, it's just Darwinism at that point) and make yourself a faith smoothie. Hey, think of it this way: One less corpse you'll have to clean up later!

4. Set the new neighbors on fire early. You'll have enough to do without trying to befriend or fight these guys, so blend up their people for points, burn their city before it starts and get back to work, wage-deity, you're on the clock!

5. Save often and take breaks... Trust me, if you don't, that Asteroid button is going to start to look awfully tempting.

So, to wrap this up, the game DOES have a lot of potential that it seems like the developers will reach if they listen to feedback and tweak a few Scrappy Mechanics. I'm recommending it because it's decently fun now and I have a lot of faith in what it may eventually become.",1598221771,1598221771,True,7,1,0.615178465843200684,0,True,False,True

This should be called a sim for babysitting corpses, not a godsim. You get a wheel of powers that sometimes glitches to a different power than you wanted, wasting all your points for power. This is a problem because most of the time you need to babysit your points so you have enough free to grab the dead bodies and move them across the map so not all your idiots walk over corpse, get sick, die, and make more sick. Even getting graveyards mid game only helps a little as often they just leave bodies all over (even when there's space for more). You spend a stupid amount of time in the game just grabbing bodies. :(

Which is tied in with a poor AI that leads to traps for your civ that lead to death spirals. Pathing out to nowhere to let your guys die, one dies on the trail to nowhere and gets everyone else to start dying - and since they're out wandering for a glitch (maybe lack of food or something), they aren't powering the civ to make whatever building/resource would save them. I guess they just added roads, but with prehistoric building they just get in the way since each building takes a ridiculous amount of space - building something close by makes sense early but you can't fix whatever effect that messes up later on. (Scale problems in this game are kinda stupid, tiny planet, but HUGE building sites with double borders to build anything in a spot - why have 2 bounding boxes if only the outer one matters for placement?)

This game shows some promise and I'll give it another try after they fix the gigantic play issues. But they really need to give it to some people that aren't in the dev bubble that try this out and see the massive design flaws they need to fix to make it fun. 
1. Fix the major use of your time in just dragging bodies around, even if you have mostly empty graveyards.
2. Make things clearer about what's going on - why would a pop be wandering off to nowhere so you can fix it.
3. Fix AI for buildings and effects - graveyards and engineering huts don't do their jobs properly
4. Fix building layouts that take up tons of space, but still override their roads - you take tons of space early in the game and need them close together, but your road layouts are stupidly huge so everything would need to be FARRR away to accommodate them.
5. Allow building of previous era buildings if need be. If there's some disaster, a building falls apart, you're low on one material, or you tech up unexpectedly, suddenly you can't build stuff because everything demands the new materials!
6. And again, fix the damn dead bodies issue. I came to build a civ, not to play grave digger the whole game, even into the industrial era. Babysitting points for powers just so I can drag away increasing numbers of bodies because someone died outside of a graveyard (that is nearly empty and won't take the body) and everyone walks over the body and gets sick just isn't fun.

So again, this is CLOSE to having fun, but after over 10 hours it just simply wasn't fun micromanaging bodies. (I managed to survive the disasters and problems most others talked about, even though it was close a few times because water demands are crazy high and you lose 90% of your production in winter)",1598203642,1598203642,False,3,0,0.548566460609436035,1,True,False,True

4 hours after just installing? I'd say I'm hooked so far. Only problem is that there is no direction given to players who are new to these type of simulation games.

Day 2 update: 
After playing around for a few hours, I have run into some things that can be fixed/arranged to better help the flow of the game (specific skill trees for Religion/Science/Medicine etc). I find myself checking back and forth through the Research Panel to learn new paths to deter from certain cultural definitions.
It feels a bit clunky and mismanaged when coming to auto-asssigning your ""nuggets"".
The nuggets AI is very poor, they do not learn from multiple mistakes, (running through an infected zone multiple times) causing you to either let the nuggets die or blow through your Creator Power Points.

This reminds me a lot of Sim City, just way more detailed, and ""world population"" based rather than just a city.

With that said, I have some complaints, although some are really only applicable to early access.
1. 1.5x speed is not enough.  The game can be really slow.  This is especially a problem in early access.  I would really like to see what the modern era is like, but I'm having trouble slogging through the same early eras yet again just to see what roads are like.
2. There needs to be a more efficient way to manage your population.  I'd say the majority of my game is spent opening the population window, sorting by age, looking for people with bad traits, zooming in on them, selecting the telekenisis tool, clicking on them for a few seconds to activate the tool, finding my way back to my temple, dumping them in to get rid of them... opening the population window, sorting by age again because there's no way to save your default sort, looking for people with bad traits... etc etc.  Without going into details, this seems to be the only way to keep things running smoothly.
3. Death and infected zones seem to be similar.  When I'm not practicing eugenics, I'm either sending bodies to the graveyard or cleaning up after they start spreading the plague.  Building more cemeteries doesn't seem to help because the undertakers just can't get to all the bodies fast enough.  

This could be a pretty great game if those features were fixed, but then again, maybe they are if I ever get out of the medieval era.",1597969572,1597969572,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It basically follows a cycle where you stockpile resources for the winter at which point your farms, fishing, and water generation freeze over. So as long as you overproduce those resources, you coast through until spring and the cycle repeats itself. 

How do my citizens learn how to build sky scrapers before they figure out how to keep a water pump running through the winter? Who knows.

The technology system is a bit silly also -- there aren't really choices to be made, you just research everything. And the ages don't really make sense. You move into the medieval time period when you research electricity? 

The game also seems to go off the rails more and more the further you progress. The problem, from my perspective, was that you cannot control where housing is built. As you progress into more advanced ages, your existing housing becomes more high density and the ""sprawl"" of your city driven through your nuggets auto-building housing comes to a stop. However, you need to keep expanding outwards to build mines, farms, industrial resource production, etc. So you end up in an position where your ""jobs"" are far away from the housing because the housing builds up while the jobs build out. Instead of automatically rebuilding homes closer to the jobs, they start walking inefficiently long distances. To effectively manage this the only solution I could find was to demolish existing housing, build over it, and force your citizens to rebuild housing elsewhere. 

At one point, my citizens embarked on a death march across the planet, for no reason I could tell. I noticed production of food came to a stand still and saw an ant line of citizens walking from one end of my city, clear across the planet, to the other end of my city. Many died along the way due to starvation/lack of water.

I also started getting ""random"" buildings built places. A watch tower appeared on the other side of a lake from my city. A hospital appeared on the other side of a mountain range. Both decayed due to having no engineers to repair them.

Somewhat randomly, both of my glass factories disappeared. I have no idea how, or why. But all of a sudden I was out of glass and upon investigation I had no glass factories. My population was always happy - so a riot didn't destroy them. They just vanished.

Additionally, the ""god"" power system is a bit clunky. You always have to go to the menu to select an ability to use. Its also near impossible to maintain believers once you get a population over 100. 

A solid ~5 hours of fun. But really nothing to replay for. And it isn't clear how more development will really change this.",1597959956,1597959956,False,2,1,0.540229856967926025,0,True,False,True

This game fills a very specific niche for me personally. Here's the gist: I have always wanted a game that, rather than making me construct a whole world from near-scratch (e.g. Cities Skylines, Rimworld, Factorio), I merely set the parameters for the world and it develops organically and logically on its own. I want to be able to WATCH a world live and thrive or flounder and die with the only ""gameplay"" being my very loose intervention into this setting. Now, I'm not going to lie and say that the Universim fills that 100%, you do in fact place buildings and designate production and choose research. BUT as someone who has played pretty much every game of note in this genre to try to fill that niche, this game by far comes the closest. I would of course love if there were a gamemode where the game more or less ""plays itself"" from the dawn of time to the colonization of the stars (most of the pieces are already there for that to be possible), but for now the current state of affairs is quite good. If you've ever found yourself with an aching need to watch an entire civilization rise and fall on a tiny but proud planet with realistic fluids and gases and stones while being able to rain hellfire down upon those who oppose you in their blasphemous towers, you're in for a treat.

After your civilization is rolling, you can literally walk away from your computer for 10 minutes and there's a 99% chance that nothing will happen. 
There's no risk or reward in this game. It still gets my recommendation because its in beta and I enjoyed starting my civilization, however, I feel like the game itself requires significant overhaul with the god mode functions in order to feel more engaging. 
The researching function is all about time, so like i said, you can literally afk and let yourself develop. 
Quests seem like a one time deal at the beginning of the game.
God powers aren't a pivital part of the game, and you'll spend most of your time going around healing random citizens than strategically using your powers for anything worth while.
Your village will put up residencies wherever they feel like, causing your city to look like a random pile of nonsense.
Towards the end, there's nothing for you to do other than spam upgrade on your buildings.

My suggestion, its a good enough game to buy and support for further development, however if you want a god game that has great balance of combat/building, has a more balanced and better god-interfence/building interface, and generally has better building mechanics for a great city in general, go play 15 year old Black and White 2.

So perhaps a god game, meets simcity 'lite'.  I found the pacing to be a bit slow, and find the computer requirements to be pretty high for this type of game.  The ""globe"" view is fun at first, but in my opinion became more of a burden in navigation.

The good parts are that it's what it claims to be. What's in the trailer/screenshots is all there, and it's fun.  Is the content and quality on par with asking price? I'm not sure. I think the game still has a ways to go.  We'll see what happens when it comes out of early access.

It has a ton of charm, a unique and pleasant style, and some fun comedy. Most games of this category tend to just throw you into blank slate world with bland tutorials and let you be on your way. There's nothing wrong with that, but it does leave something to be desired by the eventual ladder half of the game. It's very easy to lose interest in your settlement and your people.

However, The Universim grabs your attention from the beginning with it's stunning and comedic intro. It pulls you in right from the start, and keeps your attention due to the charismatic (and sometimes sassy) narrator. I really can't stress enough the amount of charm that this game oozes and brings it well above its counterparts.

Now for the gameplay. There's the standard needs of your citizens that come with every settlement game: hunger, thirst, sleep, and the like. You place facilities and give your ""nuggets"" jobs to maintain their, and everyone else's needs. The only thing that you don't have to worry about from the beginning is housing. As people are born and the population increases, the game automatically places housing to be built around you town center. At first I wasn't too happy with that system. But I grew to enjoy not having to worry about population control and making sure everyone was sheltered.

Overall I'm very impressed with the systems in place and the games ability to keep me enraptured. However, there are some major bugs and fine tuning needed to be done. Such as frequent crashes and certain AI quirks. I refuse to let those bring down this review, after all, the game is still in beta and early access which heavily imply that these problems and bugs will be fixed before the final release of the game. Especially if you take the time to try this game out and help to report bugs.

AI for carrying food and other goods is very good! Any game that has you wanting more is good!

Albert Nuggetstein? Maybe a cultural tree alongside the technology tree to customize the soul of your nugget hegemony that perhaps has an impact on your unit types and could give certain perks.

[list][*]Interesting gameplay
[*]God Powers (I always have fun messing with my nuggets)
[*]Visuals
[*]Completely unique look during different stages of the game (Stone age looks and plays completely different from Modern Age)
[*]The game is being actively develop which bring each month new things to do in the game[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list][*]Later Stages in the game need some optimization.
[*]The game is still in Early Access and has some bugs
[*]Each update you have to start over, since a lot of new mechanics and features are being added to the game. Old saves become incompatible with a new patch, but you can always switch to a different branch and continue playing your old saves.[/list]

[u]Overall, the game has a great potential and with each patch it becomes better and better. As of right now, I would give it 8/10.

About god actions its more like what the peeps wants you to do in order to raise belief. Move this, heal me, find her, water this etc etc. I mean ok, you can go berserk and start a fire here and there, but I see no point to that if you want to make progress.

The research tree, is huge, which I like. Sometimes though I found a ""tech"" to do very little, or in other words the tree is too much detailed. You need to research a lot in order to notice quite some differences in your city/planet.

What I find to be the issue with the game is that for starters, it is extremely laggy. It makes it hard to enjoy the game when your screen is lagging in every direction that you move. A second issue with this game is that it is hard to get a grasp on how to actually play the game. There needs to be more detailed instructions of how and where to find a tool for example. Since this is the case, I found myself sat staring at a screen wondering how to progress in the game. This obviously didn't lead me very far and makes it hard to get past the beginning stages. Another issue that I found is that the default text and icons in the panels are too small. Personally, I have to bring my PC all the way up to my face to be able to see or read the icons. This, along with all of the other issues makes it hard to have the relaxing experience that I know this game could provide.

Unfortunately Universim feels more like an appetizer than an entree. It has a cute art style, intuitive controls and a good sense of humor, but the gameplay is lacking in substance, difficulty and choice. Universim would make a great game for a child, but I suggest adult, strategy focused gamers look elsewhere.

Universim puts the player in the role of a god, but the religion aspect of the game lacks any meaningful choice, customization and by extension interest. The religion mechanics are as follows: God powers require creator points and creator points can be earned either overtime by faithful nuggets or instantly by sacrificing nuggets. Nuggets can either love or fear the player, the more they love the faster points generate, but less points are gained by sacrifice. If nuggets are fearful point generation is slow, but a lot of points are gained by sacrifice. Okay, but what do these points actually do? Well as the Creator you have a number of powers, but most are underwhelming and rarely used. More often than not the only powers that are used are the regeneration power to heal sick nuggets and buildings that the nugget engineers fail to fix and telekenesis to pick nuggets up to sacrifice. When the player eventually gets bored of spamming regeneration on broken buildings and flinging nuggets into the grinder there is also the option of summoning a few destructive powers, but these only provide momentary relief from the monotony of the core game mechanics. Prayers (quests) from nuggets are rare, the only choices you have in the regards to your religion's character is whether you are ""feared"" or ""loved"", and that can be changed at a whim without penalty.

Now onto the other parts of the game, city building and research. I hate to say it, but the game falls flat here as well. Like any city builder your population has needs. Water, food, healthcare, all that fun stuff, but I simply found these needs too easy to meet. Water is most important as water pumps freeze in the winter, so there needs to be a surplus. That's the only need I had trouble with in my 6.6 hours of playtime, and I only faced the problem once. There are simple production chains, but nothing interesting there either. Research for new tech is slow, but there is still little thought involved in choosing technology. Again, Universim fails to offer a thoughtful, engaging experience.

This is all a long winded way to say Universim is boring, not worth $20, and definitely not worth $30. The only exception I would make is if your looking for cute, simple city builder to get your young kid started in the genre, otherwise go play something else.",1594059901,1594059901,False,3,0,0.57055211067199707,2,True,False,True

I been watching it for some time and finally decided to leap the gun and try it our during the steam sale. Don't get me wrong the game is fun, and it is a great city builder/god simulator. It has great potential, and I was really on the edge of not refunding it. The main reason I am refunding it is I can't justify the price right now for the current state at least right now. There are 2 key factors as to why I say this; 1st reason is mainly because I am on a strict budget as of right now due to the state of the world. If I wasn't on a budget I could probably justify $22.50 ($23.84 w/ tax) as like I said it is fun. 2nd reason I say this is because of the content and the pace of the game. There is quite a bit to do in the beginning but it is insanely slow, you can speed up the game but unlike most builder type games you can only increase speed from 1x to max of 1.5x. even as max speed things take a long time to do. I see myself spending time on my phone watching stuff on there than I did playing the game as I was constantly waiting for buildings to get done or research to finish to be able to upgrade or build new structures. Also in some other reviews I read it seems that it doesn't take that long to get to the current end game as the shortest I seems is close to 10 hours and the longest it took close to 20 hours. For a game at $30 when its not on sale that isn't a lot of content. With a background and degree in game design I know that expanding games takes time and money but for the content I can see the game starting at maybe $19.99 instead of $30. As stated previously $20 isn't a bad price for the current state. Well to end this review I want to say I look forward to coming back in the future and giving it a second chance but for right now I have decided to refund it and let it sit in my wish list till further notice.",1593574399,1593574399,True,5,1,0.524283707141876221,0,True,False,True

I must say that after only 18 Hours I have seen all there is in the current version of the game, while it is enough to have some fun with it, it is not what I had hoped for the Game.
The game advertises itself with the ability to watch and guide a civilization evolve through its first ages to the late space-age, de facto the Toxic Patch V0.1.41 only allows to get to the modern era and shoot your first Satellite into orbit.

Furthermore, there's a lot of room for improvement:
- drag and pull to create an area for the healing power
- Better UI with easy hotkeys
- Better Nugget overview, also the nugget finder should not reset when closing and reopening it
- My biggest complaint is with the slackness of the nuggets, they seem to do a lot of nothing, while it is understandable that they 
   stop producing in the factories when there is no water/power, but there is no reason for not building buildings I placed and 
   prioritized.
   I had to wait hours until everything I placed was finally built, even though I had more than enough resources. They just did not 
   build stuff. The worst part was when building took so long that new technology was discovered, automatically without me 
   choosing one to develop (one can not stop the natural progress of time I guess), thus rendering old building foundations 
   useless because new knowledge requires buildings to be built with cutting edge architecture. No longer can I build my well or 
   engineer Hutt with only wood and stone, now I need Iron and cement. (Oh wait I don’t have any cement because my nuggets 
   cant manage to build the cement factory, guess they must die of thirst now)
- also, it seems like I found 2 bugs
   first, one being that air pollution does not disappear even if I build all the air quality improving buildings which set me to 
   140%/100% Air quality (my nuggets still got sick just like they did with 50% air quality
   second one: Clone Nuggets with ""Coffin Dodger"" spread the Zombie disease which infected the whole population and rid the 
   planet of 900/1000 nuggets in 10 minutes, without hope for any recovery (I hope so that this is an unintended error)

I always liked the concept of playing god in a game and this game felt very promising, I can only hope that they drop the finishing patch in a Month before the release.

So I was stuck in older games such as Zeus. Then I stumbled upon this gem. As usual I was hesitant, so I borrowed a friend's account and tried it and fell in love, as a matter of fact so much that I bought this. 16 hours in game is an understatement. I spent at least a few weekends trying and fell in love with the details. Definitely recommending my circle of friends that loves this game. 
Pros:
Detailed mechanics, but not overwhelming. (Reason why I dislike recent games. This is the first game I bought in awhile) 
Quite a few hidden easter eggs to find. (check the billboards once you hit modern ages) 
Fantastic life simulator (Happiness, sickness, 
Cons: (might be technical, might be game related, I'm a programmer myself so I know the struggles)
Specs requirement is a bit high (especially for mobile gamers, I use PC myself but I usually observe growth pattern in Task Manager)
Watch Tower guy shouldn't be hiding during alarms
Resource distributions like Iron and Stone is still a bit wonky(the colors make no sense, it can indicate very rich but the values are poor) PS: I assume is after the new update? IDK
Exile villages might have little people after some evil actions(ahem... I needed CP) but still have way too much buildings. 
Residential built too far from civilization.
Suggestions:
Direction for village growth, which is changeable later in game. So residential will be built towards the direction wanted. (maybe after town hall or some buildings are built? or just a general config?)
Wood values dropped way too much compared to v0.39

1. Game is entertaining. 
+I like the content available and I like the process. You are deeply attracted to Nuggets as they progress, build and learn. 
- The game is unbalanced. I don't like the mini gap between Stone age and Modern age. 
2. The game is balanced
+ It is neither easy, nor had
- There are stiil some uncoventional things like nuggets going to the other side of globe to cut trees, though they have trees around them.
3. You have the key to all
+ Matchmaking, punishing, etc.
- Too little options and too little real communication. A more developed system of temples, beliefs and celebrations will do.
- Too little options for God Powers. A god can not resurrect from the dead? Funny.

Gameplay is fairly solid, content is not complete but still fully playable for plenty of time to warrant the price tag, progression system is not complete through all the ages at the time of this review.

Map rotation is a bit wonky, the map is round and the controls take a little getting used to.

Management of nuggets(race of people in the game) is much more passive than games such as rimworld, and they tend to be quite stupid at times, drinking contaminated pond water and wandering repeatedly through toxic zones for no reason whatsoever for example. Just taking an afternoon walk through contaminated waste, y'know like you do.

Commentary is sarcastic and quite comical.

Too much F****** work, nuggets are dumb, so dumb that they upgrade everything at once as soon as you hit a new age period which drains your resources causing your colony to come to a grinding halt. Way to upgrade the hospital and the cemetery at the same time nuggets. Now you got dead sick people all over the streets. This game needs some serious balancing before I ever come back to play it. Waste of my time.

Also when you hit a new age period you CANNOT go back to an older age building. Which leads to a grid lock if you do not have the resources to build modern buildings. 

For example:
If you wanted to build a Wood Refinery in the modern age you need: Steel, Glass, and Cement.
Steel: You need to build a Steel Mill which needs: Glass Cement and Iron.
Glass: You need to build a Glass Factory which needs: Electronics, Plastic, Steel, and Planks.
Oh wait! Did I just see Planks as a requirement for the Glass Factory!?! I dont even need to go even further than that cause that closed one of the indignant loops of requirements. Wood Refinery produces Planks.....

You could trade with other towns but thats if they even have the option for wood planks. This does not work if you are trying to take mother earth as your own for you wont have anyone to trade with.

I will continue with the requirements to show how tedious this is as a ""God"".
Iron: You will need to build a Iron Mine which needs: Bricks and Planks.
Bricks: You will need to build a Stone Refinery which needs: Steel, Glass, and Cement.
Cement: You will need to build a Cement Factory which needs: Steel, Glass, and Planks.
Electronics: You will need to build an Electronics Factory which needs: Steel, Glass, and Cement.
Plastic: You will need to build a Plastic Factory which needs: Electronics, Steel, Glass, and Planks.
All of this is required just to convert Wood into Planks. Not to mention the Power and Water requirements as well as the material costs to build those if for some reason you do not have enough.

The Stone Age requirements are this:
Wood Refinery needs: Wood, Stone, and Water.
Water: You will need to build a Water Pump which needs: Wood and Stone.
Wood: Nuggets will need to harvest by hand.
Stone: Nuggets will need to harvest by hand.
See, no grid lock with this. The only way that could happen is if somehow in the stone age you strip the planet of all resources. But lack of resources plays through all ages so that would not be a good argument focus.

Possible Solution: Allow the player to us different age period buildings instead of forcing the player to use the current age buildings. Its not like mankind forgets how to build stone tools if the age they live in have iron or electric tools. Theres something called history that they keep track of. They will certainly have the knowledge of how to build stone tools. Or even the capability of reinventing the stone wheel.

Prioritizing building for ... well, buildings: Does not WORK. I have prioritized critical resource gathering and defense buildings but they rather spend resources and manpower on residential buildings instead. They also put resources in unprioritized buildings as well. I do understand that nuggets need a place to live while doing this but when I just ask for 1 (one) (Uno) (Ichi) just 1 building to be built they take in game years to build because they are off building nothing but residential buildings. At this point I have 50 turned up to 100 reserved for Laborers. This needs to be fixed. 

This game is nothing but Demand and no Supply.
Also this game is more of a City building game and not so much as a God Game. 
Hell even SimCity has disaster features but it doesn't cost anything except to unlock them. That has more of a God touch to it than this cause in SimCity you can cast if for free as every God should have the power to do and not rely on belief points that cap out at 1000. If this were a God Game, where are the rules? Where is the doctrine creation panel? Where is the afterlife realm? This is more of a City Building Sandbox with restrictions so you dont beat the game under 2 hours.",1590720566,1590787751,False,5,0,0.500802338123321533,0,True,False,True

Game runs very smooth despite the level of detail implemented and I cannot even begin to describe how the UI and content work so well together.

None of this however would mean much if it wasn't for the dedication I have seen from these developers. This game has grown way more than I had expected it would, especially within the time given. Every update has me excited to click that news button to see what it contains, as they are always huge leaps forward, even defying what I thought would be possible. This is all because there is a genuine level of passion when it comes to the development of this game you just don't find often. Devs also have a very refreshing sense of humor. 

Only reason I have the limited time I do with this game is one, the content just keeps growing, and two, I know that once it is officially released I will be locked in and playing this for weeks.

However, I WILL recommend this game because it is FUN. It's fun to watch your people grow and evolve into modern society. The game plays exactly how it's advertised and described. There are actually a few more options for certain things than I expected which is a plus!

BUT...

The only downside that im obligated to tell you before you purchase this game would be the fact that its simply NOT DONE (beta). That doesn't mean its bad though. Actually, I am impressed that an incomplete game like this is THIS FUN.

Some examples of the game being incomplete would be things like:
- Struggling tutorial that explains core concepts but doesn't explain quality of life things (ex. I didnt know I could heal buildings with powers until 4 hours later when I googled it myself).

- The narrator stops talking after a while and sometimes repeats himself (not annoying though). I think the game just doesnt have enough dialogue for more than 4 hours of playing (which is okay).

- Glitches. I know its in beta, and of course it'll get fixed but there are bugs that can be annoying. They're not game breaking like when the game first came out (People would get stuck and would be unable to build/fix buildings, no save feature, etc...but its been fixed).

Besides those things, its a great game! It's satisfying leveling up your people and have more worshipers. You have special powers that you can use that steers your people into certain directions (you can rig elections for example).

I have been playing this for a good time when it was really earily it has come so far. It's one of my favorite games to play and has great features from seeing rick and morty portal in to say hi to UFO's coming to abduct your nuggets. Watching your city evolve from a stone age to medevil to modern age is awesome. The best yet to come to travel to other planets and colonized. Face meteors tornadoes wind storms and nuggets trying to blow up your buildings. Put nuggets in jail and execute them or rehabilitate them and bring them back to society. Get attacked by wolves or have a plague wipe your city. My favorite the God powers to shield your city from danger or lighting strike incoming threats or make it rain to refill your likes and reservoirs or call down a meteor to wipe another city.

Black & White was the closest but it was a game that quickly became tedious and slow if you didn't play perfectly. This is by far the most fun God game I've ever played and almost everything I could wish for in such a game. I have a fascination with the idea of watching a civilization flourish beneath me and become self sufficient without my guidance. It's a little addicting. 
I will say that my issues are not non-existent though. Like, I wish nuggets could build their own factories when they realize they're really low, or build their own oil jacks and gas mines but I always have to do those things for them. The chain of resources to make later resources can be a little head spinny and annoying with how much you have to manage it, but you could also argue that's part of the challenge and fun. Another thing is that this game can be a little preachy about the environment and it isn't always accurate in what it tries to say. Namely, nuclear fission is the big bad polluter that puts all other polluters to shame in this game, having the highest pollution rating out of every building which is silly because it technically is the most viable green energy right now. That is something I choose to look past though because the rest of the game is phenomenal.

UNFORTUNATELY, once the game sees that you are producing the bricks, all the old buildings you used to be able to build with regular rocks and trees are no longer able to be built with regular rocks and trees. Now they ALL require these special bricks. The engineer building requires bricks and once it is falls apart I can't rebuild it without bricks. But all my nuggets are DYING and thirsting to death because the wells have all fallen apart because I can't rebuild new ones without the special bricks and I can't repair the fallen apart wells without engineers. But I can't build a new brick building factory because my nuggets are too worn out and thirsting to death. They can't produce bricks fast enough to rebuild the wells and engineer buildings which are the most important things in the game I think. The bricks take forever to make and by the time even one is made, everyone starves to death. 

THIS MUST BE FIXED. I think the makers of the game need to NOT let everything that previously could be built without brick suddenly require brick once brick becomes a thing in the game.  It never required brick before so it shouldn't require it later. Only new buildings that require brick should need brick.

After 7 hours of playtime, I feel like the amount of content available is satisfactory. Looking to update this as I spend more time on it. I was addicted from the very start and my interests have only increased as I continued playing. This is a great city builder with an extraordinary amount of care and artistry shown throughout. I highly recommend picking this up even in the beta stage.

Pros:
- The amount of detail put into the game is pretty impressive. 
- The camera movement is very unique. I haven't seen a game quite accomplish the same type of camera freedom. 
- The character of the game is entertaining. There's a lot of humor great humor! 
- The game picks up a lot after the stone age, so stick that through. 
- The variations in unique residential buildings past the stone age is impressive!
- Research tree is very expansive, which offers a lot to work toward as you're building your civilization.

Cons:
- After my first 2 hours, the game crashed 3-4 times. The next day I didn't have this issue. My suggestion is to save as often as you can. 
- The narrative guidance is helpful at first, but pretty  much disappears after the stone age.
- There isn't much of a storyline or campaign, which is good and bad. I think building aimlessly is fun for a bit, but an objective other than research would be nice. I would assume additions will happen as the game furthers development.
- Interactions with neighboring villages is pretty pointless.

I managed to play most of what the game had to offer in about 11 hours - consisting of the start of my civilization all the way to sending a satellite into space (not sure what it's purpose is yet either).

From the onset of the game you are somewhat assisted by a guide, much like other games. You start by doing little things and slowly but surely you feel like every little thing you do has an impact on how things turn out going forward. From helping your nuggets (people) find love and reproducing all the way to polluting the atmosphere and suffering the consequences in the form of natural disasters.

There are a few things that had me scratching my head such as medieval buildings without the option to upgrade standing next to a skyscraper of the modern age, but I assume the mechanics and flow of research and other certain things still need a look.

But overall, I count myself lucky to have this game in my library. Will most likely come back to it for another round of game play.

A few words to the developers:
- Thank you! This game is so beautiful and creative.
- A fly to event should be added to all your warnings (wolf attacks, riots, vandalism).
- Stop the fly to events from changing your zoom extent (was rather irritating when I got the cam angle right for me that some event or auto navigate completely messed it up) or allow me to revert back to my desired cam angle (saved zoom extent).
- Where are the roads?

The best part of the game is its original concept.  The ability to develop a civilization through the years on a round planet is really great and very addicting.  The God game aspect is also done in an original way and, when used correctly, makes keeping your Nuggets alive simple.

The updates have been regular every couple months or so.  The most recent update adds 100% more detail to skycrapers and large buildings later in the late game.  That coupled with the addition of medieval and modern bridges and other balances, additions and nerfs has made the game play much more smooth.

The tech tree in this latest iteration flows much better i.e. they've moved research technology around in the tree to where it makes more sense.  

The planet is far bigger than the first iteration of 'The Universim'.  Mountains are more dramatic, oceans/lakes are larger so provide more water for pumps and fish for, well, fishing. The overall graphic fidelity is greatly improved as well.  The new 'neighborhood house' theme that the Nuggets build makes each one feel more personal than the bland homes they used to build.  Greater diversity among buildings is a great thing.

Hopefully, the next update will include the ability to go into space and colonize other planets.  I'm not sure what exactly that is going to entail, but I'm excited about the prospect of it.  We know for sure that Oxygen Generators will be used to terraform found planets, which is so cool.  

Some things that still need tweaking:

When you enter the 'modern era' the nuggets start building skyscrapers all over the place, updating the Medieval homes.  After the skyscrapers are built, the nuggets can take quite a long time to actually inhabit these upgraded structures.  During that transition period, i end up losing about 25% of my overall population.  With that loss in workers, it makes it very difficult to upgrade structures that are being built due to the high level of deaths (or lack of births).

Engineers don't seem to prioritize the repair of buildings that are 'on their last leg'.  

Population is still limited to about 400-450 Nuggets or so.  I'd love to have an option to make this unlimited if so chosen.  I know this would probably kill most computers, but I'd like to see that anyway to push the limit.  

TLDR: The game is very fun to play.  For the amount of content currently at play, the $30 is well worth the price.  We are just 1 or 2 more updates away from the full release of The Universim which will see us leaving our planet and reaching for the stars.  When that happens, the $30 is a definite no-brainer.  The tech tree is fairly in-depth and the Godplay is unique.  Pick it up and play it now for what it is and also what it will be in the near future.

Even in Beta, the game is still missing a lot of features. I'm not sure if they were there at some point and then later removed for reworking (like paths and roads), if they're just unseen glitches that have survived for over a year (no working wind/heat maps which make things like wind turbines almost impossible to place correctly to be useful), or if they were just seen as unimportant and ignored.

To this keep this relatively short I'll list two of my biggest issues:

It took me about 1.5 days of gameplay to figure out how to play because the in-game wiki is dismally empty of how-to info. It explains what things can do, but does not expouse on what any of those factors mean to the player or how it affects other parts of the game, or even how to use it or what it's used for. Most of that I had to puzzle through experimentation, which can be fun or a complete waste of time resources. I can understand not handholding, but at least explain the basics so it's not so discouraging for a first timer who's not been apart of the game since early development.

Also, this game needs a lot of love in terms of quality of life gameplay. Example: when certain scenarios which could hurt your progress occur, namely with exile priests and spies, you can either allow them to do all the damage they want for 5 minutes or so OR... spend at least 45 minutes to 1 hour of real-time trying to find them and get rid of them. This may seem like a fun game of Where's Waldo, especially since most of the nugget's look exactly the same except for small differences that you have zoom in and squint at to see if you don't want to click on every single one. But once you reach about 100-200+, this becomes incredibly cumbersome and frustrating. You can see the damage they're doing but CANNOT SEE THEM and also have almost no way to protect your town against it since even your guards and police are defenseless against this kind of attack. This could be fixed with at least more hints than clothing, even a difficulty slider where you can decided how you want to be shown factors like these. Do you want just visuals hints? Sounds too? A radius marker of where to search in your large city? OR do you just want to be zoomed in so you can handle the problem as you see fit and just get back to main point of the game? I have this same issue with the wolf attacks too, but with that I can understand. They're supposed to be sudden with little warning and no idea where it could come from. The spies and priests should be obvious to the people in your town and give you at least SOMETHING to make it easier to single them out from hundreds. Some of the threats in this game or horribly overbalanced with no viable way to counteract them to make it more fun instead of grueling. EDIT: I have seen they've added a feature so that your enforcement will now help with exile attacks. Whether that includes subterfuge as well as head-on raids, remains to be seen since I'll have to start a whole new game to find out.

I won't say this game is not enjoyable. It is a lot of fun and once I puzzled through most of it (at least to the modern stage) I was able to create better strategies so I could make life better for my nuggets.


EDIT: In an early version of this review, my main problem with the game was a possible glitch involving population controls. As in, I couldn't figure out how to go above 250 without my city stagnatin not growing further. After experimenting with a new city, I found this issue again but through reckless abandon I figured something out differently. I don't know if this actually solved the issue but now 400 and counting, I must have done something right.

First I decided to implement schools much earlier in the game, so when education was called for, I wouldn't be stuck with a bunch of building with no people working in them. I currently have two which are fully upgraded and this helped a great deal. Next, when the pop started to stagnate at 250, I demolished almost all of the empty highrises I had, which freed up a lot of space for new work buildings. I don't know what else I could have done to help with the problem, but I made it to the ""end"" of the game meaning all research has been completed.

Also, wished you could go to the location of one of the characters by clicking on their name or a button along side their name that allows you to do that. At one point accidentally started a fire that got out of control and the characters walked right through it and well, died. Shouldn't they be afraid and avoid such out of control fires? Wish when something like that happened while the fire was small they would step up bucket brigades provided of course they have advanced enough to have buckets. At one point, I had to rescue one of the youngsters. Searched everywhere couldn't find them. They appeared in a spot dead when the time ran out and the spot was a place I had searched many times. Until they died, they were effectively invisible. That's it for now.

So this I would say is my first time playing a game of this nature.
Aside from sims and things like that, I feel this game is very different from that.

So at first I really loved this game, I found it so amazing, fun, and interesting researching new things and watching the buildings and things upgrade.
I will say that there were a few times I wanted to completely start from scratch, and to be honest I'm still debating on it.
I think the first time playing, you really start to understand how you should of gone about things, rather than how you did go about things.


Like resources for example, once I hit medieval times, most residential buildings, and almost all other buildings needed planks, and bricks. 
Now the issue with that was that I didn't have the buildings built to produce that planks and bricks needed, so once I did build those buildings, the residential buildings would almost suck up those resources leaving me with almost nothing to build or upgrade other buildings I needed.
Also with water, in the beginning it was almost like I needed more pumps, but as I upgraded the pumps I needed less, which was great because having so many pumps drains the lake faster.

So onto the upgrading, and researching, I've learned that if you're not researching anything at all, you get constant notifs letting you know you're not, however I've also noticed that every once in a while the nuggets will do research on their own, and randomly you'll get the notification on the success of something researched.
I do feel however that the researching part of the game is VERY confusing, and sometimes makes absolutely no sense.
~For example, medieval times did not have electricity, yet coming right out of stone age, they discover electricity? that makes absolutely no sense, seeming they can't use it until modern age. Also I had to delete my school in order to build something else, and when I went back to go build the school, It was a university in the modern age and had completely skipped the medieval age lol. I was so confused! 

So as of right now, my city or whatever you wanna call it is so mixed up, I still have some buildings in the Stone age, some in the medieval age, and some in the modern age. 
The nuggets also researched modern cars randomly, and now I have cars driving around this city with stone aged buildings still???? 
I'm not gonna lie its kind of turned me off this game, like why aren't all my buildings in the medieval age when I followed the research properly? 

Also why did we go from medieval straight into literal sky scrapers, and modern day cars?
what happened to the cars before the cars we have now a days, and the bicycles people would use to get around, or the big corseted dresses etc. It's just all so confusing to me xD
I think the devs need to think these ages through a bit more, and work on not having stone age buildings along with modern age buildings because it looks ridiculous.

I'll keep playing the game to see what happens, but yeah...
Also just a couple other things I dislike about the game, is the fact you can't rotate or move buildings once they're placed, also that you cannot build on mountains which for some buildings are where resources are.
I also think the wolf attacks get boring, Idk if there are different attacks further into the game, but yawn.",1582920768,1583100291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The wolves aren't so bad after you get guns lol. The air thing isn't so bad after you learn you can click and drag the planting God power to plant tons of trees at once, that being said the excess of trees is annoying because then you can't hardly see your buildings. Loading screen freezes up in places and sometimes fully freezes up and crashes, and my game itself while playing has hard crashed twice now in about 3 days.

Game design wise, it makes a lot of mistakes.

The ages system is unintuitive, it feels like you're stuck forever in the stone age, a flintstones sort of stone age... it makes little sense and doesn't feel like you're progressing through the game.

The system for resource gathering and processing needs a complete rework. Your ability to gather and produce doesn't upgrade as your facilities upgrade, so this ends up stalling your progress unnecessarily. It feels like you're being punished for advancing the tech tree instead of it enabling you to expand.

The moment you get an upgraded version of a building, you must build new ones in their upgraded version with the requirement of specialized materials, but you don't get upgrades to make this materials easier to get. You are basically building advanced complex buildings but still chopping down trees with a stone axe. This slows down the midgame to a crawl and potentially prevents you from recovering from a natural disaster.

The narrator and popup messages are constantly being obnoxious and pedantic... the game tries to be funny with this but it fails, the more you hear or read these stupid remarks over and over, the more you want to punch the dev in the face.",1582658965,1582658965,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

*Those damn wolves always trying to kill my nuggets!

The game's tutorial was relatively helpful, and good enough to get the hang of it.

However, the Universim is a game about about leading your civilization through the stages that humans have went through throughout the years, and that it does a good job at. You lead you're people, called ""nuggets,"" who learn to help within their civilization and slowly but surely become stronger and smarter, Here, you help them discover and build things to ensure their survival through the year to come. Slowly your population will increase and soon you'll be left with a fully functioning society who no longer will require a God, but will still be protected and nurtured by one. You do, however, face many struggles while trying to develop over the ages. From wolfs and people attacking your civilization to tornadoes and meteors ravaging your lands, you are always faced with a challenge

Furthermore, I would deem this game to be great and I look forward to the future of the Universim and am curious to see if it'll expand and become the game I know it can be. But, i'm not entirely sure if it is in the stage to be purchased at the moment i'm typing this. Now, don't get me wrong, the Universim is a AMAZING game, from the simplistic graphics to the gameplay mechanics that  help you rise to the top. I just at this point don't see that it has reached it's full potential as far as a game to capture the players fill attention. Once getting to the Modern Stage (Stone > Medieval > Modern) I takes a turn as your Nuggets seem to not need you anymore and can advance on their own. This takes some fun out the game as all you're left to do is protect from disasters that are soon to come at a random time throughout their progression. 

Overall, The Universim is a GREAT game and I do look forward to the future progression that is to come from the development team and the creators as a whole

I love god games, and had this on my wishlist for around a year. Finally around the end of November I really wanted to play a new/different one. The choice was between this and one or two others. Ended up picking this up on a Humble Store sale for like $18.

I sorta wish I hadn't. I don't know what it is about this game, but it doesn't ""grab me"" at all. The graphics are nice (especially after the beta release) and the narrator is funny (the first few times) but beyond that it's just... sub-meh.

The tech tree is a bit nonsensical in it's layout and the flow/order in which you unlock things. I'll admit, tech trees are kinda hard to get right or interesting in any game (Civ always comes to mind) but this one is just garbage. I don't like how the butt Nuggets build their own houses as they may *ahem*probably will*ahem* put it in a place where you planned to put something else. 

In the end, this game just bores me. Even when I've streamed it on Twitch a few times I've switched to another game after about an hour of this because it's just not interesting. Normally I only play one game from the beginning to end of my streams.

I suppose you could make a case for this being a good game, but apart from graphics I really don't find a whole lot here. I'll keep playing from time to time to see if things change but for now I can't personally recommend it to even someone who enjoys god games. It worries me because now that it's moved to beta that there won't be any new features or real changes. If that's the case it'll probably end up as another digital paperweight in my Steam library. *sigh*

I don't know why it's in beta.  It's not feature complete.  But as it is, this one's still worth a play-and-save to wait for the rest.  

Pros: 

The narrator and notification system.

Cons:

The narrator and notification system.

There should be a limit to the number of times the same line will repeat, followed by a lengthy timer before it's heard again.  That, or many more lines.  

The notification sound should scale.  When you've got a dozen or so nuggets (people), getting a sound effect for a death makes sense.  When you're nearing a population of 500, that same sound effect is a nuisance.  So, maybe give the sound when 10% of the population at last sounding has perished.

MY real reason for writing a review instead of lurking like most of the time is to point out one thing i worry about. I watched a few streamers play this and noticed that people may advance through the tech tree without understanding how the basic economy of water works. This leads to them not having enough pumps to support their civilization but being unable to build the cheap wood and stone pumps because the old tech is locked out by the more expensive ones. This essentially soft locks a game and i really hope you guys fix this somehow (by either forcing people to understand how essential mechanics work or letting us make cheaper techs idk) either way i am loving it so far and the beta has proven to be exactly what i expected and more i am more than excited to play the full game.,1581277677,1581277677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Don't worry about micromanaging everything! At the start, with so few nuggets, they will need some guidance. Eventually they'll learn and discover ways to take care of themselves.

I have probably restarted this game multiple times with the updates as they have added, but I haven't really found myself frustrated by having to start over as I enjoy being able to have this game on while I watch videos. 

There are pros and cons to this game, of course. Some of which I have seen mentioned in previous comments and some that have not been mentioned.

Some pros to this game definitely include the simulation and god-like abilities. I like feeling as though I am controlling the dynamics of my game and can make decisions that will influence my people. I also very much enjoy being able to place my buildings and decide how I want my layout to be, especially when it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure buildings are reaching places they need to.

Some cons to this game, and I'm regretful that there are quite a few more than pros, includes a huge issue in the nuggets (people) actually doing things. In the beginning as your civilization is small, they participate in working and completing buildings, but as your civilization grows, the nuggets stop doing things, even when you try to motivate them. I have also run into issues where no matter what I do, I just can't seem to get enough resources. I will have 10-20 wood and stone refineries as well as multiple wood farms and stone mines and still don't seem to have enough stone blocks and wooden planks to build. Then when you get into the fancy technology like plastic, those buildings begin to take up an extreme amount of gas and oil, which again, no matter how many you have, just don't seem to be enough. Then there's the issue of balancing your nugget happiness with crime. 

I understand that it is meant to be difficult and to make you question what you want to do with your civilization, but at some point, it becomes exhausting trying to balance things and wasting resources on additional parks or buildings in order to reduce crime and up their happiness.

I do believe that if the creators continue working hard and fixing some of these issues, the game can be amazing. I really loved it in the early stages of early access, but as they continue to add things to the game, they forget to go back and fix what they already have that isn't working. That said, I do recommend this game; probably not until it is fully released and potentially on sale in the future.",1580174316,1580174316,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Secondly, and this is what turned me off from the game entirely, there is NO option to simply create new life. If your first two people die, that's it. Game over. Only, it doesn't tell you anything! It doesn't tell you that you've lost the game. And there is NO WAY to create new life, causing you to have to exit the game entirely and start a new game.

This is how a proclaimed God Game should work in acordance with reality. A God may or may not take part but that shouldn't be a factor in the growth of a civilization.

At one point, I opened up three boxes of plague because I had so few believers. I assumed my civilization will crumble and I'd have to start a new with some research done but the nuggets are more resilient than you think. After amassing more than 200 population, the battering they took from ufos to meteors to tornadoes and finally to my directly intentional plague outbreak, they rose from the dark ages, with a more fervent belief of me. With my CP gen increased, I was able to to bring them out of the dark ages slowly but surely until they discovered industrialization. By that point, I was sure they didnt need me, but when I look to my total amount of followers, half of them still do.... and that's how I like it.

The universim is finally shaping upto me the game I bought. I hope in beta they apply variables per seed planet
- Every planet you start with has a different challenge thus replayability is assured (such as UFO ladden planets, volcanic ash planets, oceanic planets, etc)

 or add the ability to build across the universe
- All planets run out of gas, water, oxygen, thus we'd have to migrate to survive and sustain economy. In doing so we would eventually encounter competing aliens of the universe ensuring a space warfare

I researched everything that is apparently available, though gathering the resources (by building enough buildings to gather the resources and enough nuggets to work them) becomes a bit more of a drag later on, so I have not launched any satellites. Also, a lot of the god powers are a bit clicky. It would be a lot better if various powers, buildings, etc. were mapped to the keyboard. 
A quick example is the pain it is to constantly check up on and find the ministry. Once your city is developed that building will sort of blend in, so you will probably need to navigate the building menu, which means you will need to scroll through either the names of the buildings or the buildings themselves and then click to icon to watch the camera slowly pan over to the building.

So improvements that should be made to the game include:
Mapped keys to powers and buildings
Make the arrow keys much much faster
Foreign villages develop at a similar rate to you (or at least at all), and you/your nuggets have more regular interactions with them (actual warfare, initiated trade, incorporation into your city, etc)
Animals having better behavior, and some way to track their numbers (Bears never attack anyone)
Maybe some way of making residential buildings... I was trying to develop a secondary city on the other side of the planet in order to extract more resources such as iron and stone and every nugget drove across the globe instead of building their houses there.
Automatic research should actually make your pops research stuff automatically instead of me having to click a line up of things to research (or maybe make it so that research is more spontaneous discovery until you reach a level of development that you can build some sort of research center).
might be a few other things I am not thinking of yet...

The issue is after playing a civilization and getting into the mid-late game, the whole thing falls apart. Resources in late game are extremely tedious and once your city gets up to around 2-300 nuggets they glitch all the time. I would build a building to see workers ""doing nothing"" I would fire them, hire new ones, use god powers to motivate and they would all ""do nothing"". So I then tried destroying the building and rebuilding it and boom now the nuggets are working. 

Many times I found that the nuggets would jump into a car, out of a car, into a car, out of car, into a car.. do you get my point? Without moving. They just freeze. Nuggets wouldn't move resources to be further refined. I have a building that needs gas and have 300 gas sitting there.

The Universim is shaping up to be a God Sim that hasn't been seen in decades. The game starts with you placing down a starting point and effectively spawning an ""Adam & Eve."" From those 2 little nuggets (the 'people' of this game) come forth an entire civilization that slowly spreads across the entire globe given to you. Starting with nothing, a literal caveman-esq civilization, as their deity you control their fate. As time progresses you'll lose some of these folks who will cast off their fate and go on to create their own cities. Will you help them, or (as in my case) call down lightning on those blasphemous invaders? 

I could go on and on about the little details in this game, or even the comedy involved with the narrator. Watching Nuggets get arrested and transported to prison, or chased all over the city is pretty fun too. I bought this game in its alpha state and am glad to finally see it coming to it's beta release. The promises these devs are offering is something to be excited about and if you haven't bought this game yet, well you're wasting your time with a lot of other games out there. 

If you like time management games (RimWorld), tycoon games (Planet Zoo, Jurassic World), or are just looking to try something new (because this actually is something new) then I recommend you give it a shot. If those types of games aren't your fancy? Then that's alright to and just give it a thumbs up and a pass, but I promise you're missing out.",1577473367,1577473367,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Sure I wish there was more depth, but that'll be added when the game is finished, and updates seem to be coming regularly. I have my small qualms here and there, with small performance lag bits like framerate drops occurring at random intervals, and the fact that you can accidentally kill one of your two first Nuggets by dropping a rock on them isn't ideal. In addition to that, I do find myself annoyed by the UFOs as I can't figure out how to stop them. I mean, if I'm God, shouldn't I be able to just Telekinesis the ship and slam it into the ground? I also found myself bummed out when I found that my people sometimes had different reactions. In one play session (Where I was just learning how to play essentially) a neighboring tribe started sending Atheist Priests into my tribe to get them to stop following me. In response, I burned their village to the ground and tossed lightning bolts at them like Zeus until they had all died. My followers thought that was pretty dope, and loved me even more. But in another playthrough, my citizens adored me, and I faced a similar situation again. So, I went full Zeus on the enemy tribe and expected to see some more of my people adoring me. Instead, they were terrified of me, and they had no love for me, only fear. While yes I plan to play a megalomaniacal playthrough at some point, it was a bit odd that citizens could have such drastically different reactions to similar situations. Also, I had one playthrough where I tried to do a nice thing and bring a random neighbor tribe person into my village, hoping they'd come join my people. They were displeased by this and were labeled as aggressive, so I figured I had to save my people somehow and decided I'd put them back. Well, they were hard to find again so when I did I panicked and used them as a human sacrifice to myself. Which made me feel a little odd, considering they weren't a procreative threat to my people (it was one solo nugget, no partner in sight). I wish there was a way I could have just plopped them into my people, and they'd spend some time becoming friendly with us and adopting my people's unique culture.

So this game is overall quite okay but it's also filled with a lot of nonsense and unbalanced features in my opinion. 

So here are the good and bad aspects of the game:

[b]+(Good)[/b] You are playing a god and you have several powers to play with. You can decide whether you want to be a bad or a good guy. 

[b]-(Bad)[/b] However, it won't have much of an impact nevertheless. You can quickly be good or bad depending on your actions...

[b]+(Good)[/b]  The narrator is very funny and I even had to laugh in some situations. 

[b]-(Bad)[/b]  He's indeed fun. But whenever I zoom in to my city and go near a hut or house, where nuggets having crazy sex leaving an earthquake behind, he says always the same joke over and over again. I mean it was fun the first times but if you hear that unlimited times it gets extremely annoying.

[b]+(Good)[/b] There is a lot of buildings and upgrade options. Which means it's a mix of a simulation and city builder.

[b]-(Bad)[/b] Unfortunately, due that you aren't able to upgrade everything which leaves some areas ""not upgraded"" forever even while in the modern age. It might be a bug.

[b]+(Good)[/b] You have a followers ""believers"" system similar to Black & White which gives you points to spend on to your power.

[b]-(Bad)[/b] The followers or believers are extremely unbalanced. You'll lose much more than you gain ultimately. It's very tricky and in my opinion the most bothersome task in this game to deal with. 

[b]+(Good) [/b]There are a lot of mini-quests again similar too Black & White to gain extra benefits.

[b]-(Bad)[/b] These quests are very plain sadly and you can tell that the developers wanted to add similar features which you've seen in Black and White. Unfortunately, they couldn't keep up with that and it's rather bothersome than enjoyable. 

[b]+(Good) [/b]There is trade in this game.

[b]-(Bad)[/b] I've never seen such a boring trade system in any other game.

[b]+(Good)[/b] At some point in the game, you have criminal activities such as theft, vandalism or even cases where priests from other cities are trying to get rid of your believers. It's a nice addition.

[b]-(Bad)[/b] Unfortunately, you won't have any methods to search for them. Everything is handled automatically except for those priests. You have to find them with your own eyes. Good luck with that if you have a big city with around 300 people... 

[b]+(Good)[/b] There are some challenges like tornados, wasps who eat everything or even a ufo which you'll meet pretty soon. 

[b]-(Bad)[/b]  They might sound like challenges but they aren't. It's just annoying honestly. First of all, that ufo will appear over and over again he'll just spawn regularly and it's always the same situation. The same goes on to the other things.

Also while I'm normally a good hearted god, it is very fun to set exile/enemy towns on fire or send a barrage of meteors their way :3

The game isnt difficult but if your stuck the commentator does give you advice like building a lot of water reservoirs as lakes freeze in winter which stops the water pumps. 
One tip from me is if your ever low on creator points, drop a close to dying of old age nugget into the shrine for more creator points.  Also after sacrificing nuggets you can always use the jolt of joy god power to cheer your people up :)

Would drop nuggets into the meat grinder of a temple they built for me again.

Universim suprisingly became my fav god game out of nowhere.  A fun balance of autonomous agents (nuggets) doing their thing without the need to constantly intervene, and building and upgrading to fulfill their needs and desires.  As the game progresses, the curve of wants and needs for you to put on your holy mayor-god hat and satisfy your growing race of nugs increases at a steady, satisfying pace.

It's a pretty game with polished production values for an early access title.  The narrator is pretty high quality although like all narrators in sandbox games like this, it eventually gets pretty repetitive.  There are a few bonuses you can acquire by scouting out the far corners of your planet, and the planet is impressive in scale. 
 
I'd pretty much given up on it about a year ago when development seemed stalled but apparently they got their feces together and have been steadily adding significant content for the last few months.  Even in its first phases it was still a pretty fun if shallow experience, but the technological upgrade chain keeps expanding.  I will say that improving technology doesn't change the gameplay all that much until you get to the point where you can vary work shifts for your nuggets, at which point the game gets very micromanagey and stops being much fun.  You see, your nuggets only get it on and increase the population when both spouses are home, not at work, so you have to take all kinds of extra care to make sure households are working the same shifts or your death rate will start to soar above the birth rate.  Once I get up to 200 or so nugs, it takes a whole lot of fiddly manual 'fall in love and make babies' spells\miracles to keep the population from dropping off.  That part of the game definitely needs to be massaged, or even better, the sexxytime mechanic should be overhauled.  Irl couples that work different shifts don't find themselves completely prevented from finding a few minutes for the ""gross wonders of biological reproduction"" as the narrator puts it.  And if our entire civilization had to rely on a god to have more than a handful of babies in a large community, well either that god would have to be super beneficent, really into porn, or just like very, very bored to do the work to keep them from dying out.
I should mention that I haven't gotten to the most recent technology level added so I can't comment on anything beyond mining and manufacturing with iron.

The city design paradigm is pretty casual.  Building placement doesn't matter all that much other than certain buildings need to be within coverage areas, like of engineer huts for example so everything doesn't collapse into rubble, and if wells are spaced too far apart, nuggets will have to waste time travelling a long way for a drink and their health will suffer if they dehydrate.  Out of the way warehouses will suck up time nuggets could be using to work on long treks to transport goods.  Efficient planning matters a bit more than in Foundation, for example, but not by much.

There are other rival cities that sprout up over time but they don't really have much effect other than being hella annoying from time to time.  That feature either needs to be left out or dropped.  I think this game would be alot of fun multiplayer but I've heard nothing about plans for it.

It's a good game.  It's got that hard-to-quit game crack thing going for it.  And other than the micromanaging required to get a big civilization to survive, it's low on the frustration meter too.  If you ever do get frustrated there are plenty of entertaining ways to smite your subjects.",1576210031,1576210031,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It also is a very slow game and required too much computing resources, and still resulted in bad performance.

Fullstory
Still full of bugs, including clashing level and seriously annoying bugs. Your AI population (called: Nugget) is so stupid that make other tribes and natural disasters paled in comparison. You must depend on your AI pops, on manufacturing, transporting, reproducing, even find a replacement for those who retired. But I dare say that most of AI are terribly unbelievably incompetent at all of them.

These problems can be fixed, but until then I can't recommend this game. It is based on a good idea with terrible implementations.

Revise/addition: Played more, tried to solve problem. And decided to uninstall. This game is too unbalanced in many regards.

Research most of the time will have much more drawback than benefit, spamming research nonstop will lead you to bad end. Building upgrade research will cost new, expensive in both material and manpower, resources. And sometime, demand educated workers, which will quickly be shortage due too many upgraded key buildings required them, included the University that produce them, and Engineering which is pretty much the most important building that needed to build enmass. Some problem is also never happen untill you researched its resolution, like fire. And fire fighter is unreliable. Some upgraded building can't work if all worker not presence, because upgrading add more worker slots, and Nuggets can find every excuses to not working at that time, leading to less efficiency for ""upgraded"" building. You also have no choice to build lower level new building after researched an upgrade, nor can downgrade any buildings.

Nuggets are lazy by design, probably resulted of too much micro managements in them. It seem like as population grew, individual performance are dropped sharply. They will do nothing for awhile even every conditions are met. They also did that even the solution lied in next build. They also seem to reproduce less by proportional in mid-late game, leading to populations boom and collapse, with peak pops still far less than enough to support continuously late game economy. The worst case I found is that their pathfinders crashed and they stay still in place for more than a year, then died from thirsting. 

Lastly, Game is so slow by design. Even tech rush (suicide) strategy required about 12 hours to research all important tech, which you probably need a whole RL year, if not forever to actually use them, because aforementioned inherent pop cap and inefficienyness. Slow tech strategy work more better, but required you to know required resources for the next level, and stock them up, very boringgggg.",1575226615,1576130444,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

While it's clear that a lot of love has gone into this game, it needs a huge amount of refining before it's ready for mainstream. Here are a few of the bugs I ran into:

1) Once you research fire protection, you also have to deal with random fires. The firefighters cannot stop these first, requiring you to put it out with magic.
2) The magic doesn't always work. Sometimes you select a spell and a target and while the cost is paid, the spell doesn't take effect. See case above where you need to put out a fire and can't. Now those buildings are simply gone.
3) You can get yourself into a situation where you've researched your way out of the game. If, for instance, your last stone refinery falls apart and you've researched the upgraded stone refinery, you'll need cement in order to build a new one. Cement requires stone bricks, made in the stone refinery. There's no way to build the old tech version. If you have run out of stone bricks and cannot build the new upgraded refinery, you are now completely stuck and will have to start over entirely if you want to progress any further.
4) Auto-research in on by default. Unless you switch it off, you may find yourself in a spot where your science minister keeps on researching, causing you to fall into a case like #3. The science minister can also choose to research techs that lock others and it doesn't seem to take into account prior choices. 

Compared to those problems, the rest are fairly minor (like small AI villages attacking your large city even though they are technologically inferior and drastically outnumbered). This is going to be a very cool game when the developer pulls it together but right now the experience fizzles out when you get to the mid game.

I have noticed many negative posts about The Universim and I want to put people fears at ease. I bought this game last year, so i have not had to deal with the long wait of making this a completed game, however over the past few months Crytivo and their devs have been making huge strides to making The Universim an complete game! I do suggest buying this game when its on sale ( I think I bought this game for either $15.99 or $19.99 on sale.)                                                                                        Pros: This game is constantly getting new updates and new content that makes me come back for more! The Visuals of the game are pleasing to look at and if you love micromanaging ( I do), plus city building with some god powers and the promise of space exploration, I believe this is the game for you! From the looks of it, all of the updates are FREE, so no need to be dropping TONS OF CASH on dlcs. (REMINDER: Early Access Game - $29.99 is pretty cheap for the amount of content they have. Devs gotta eat too) Devs do listen to the community and try their best to fix known issues!!                               CONS: Dear god, please fix the nuggets population growth/death rates. I have been able to reach 350 nuggets but thats also with me spending ALL MY GOD POINTS TO MATING THE HECK OUT OF MY NUGGETS. Wish we had more god points to do more in game and hopefully devs will take notice of this post to fix those issues. Other then that, I have no real issues with this game. (I hate wolves and mother nature in the game though, not going lie.)                                                                           Hope this review is helpful to others interested in this game! Just wait for a sale to buy it and remember to keep an eye out for their monthly updates! Thanks again! :)

UPDATE (5/26): More content, more fun! 10/10 would still buy this game. I know people are still waiting for space exploration and being able to fully settle your homeworld / other planets, but i can reassure people that we will see all this content within the year!

It does require some focus to start - not like other 'sim' games where you can mostly sit back and let things develop in early stages. 

That being said, once the game started taking off, it kept me going.  I'm curious to see how it continues to progress, but the game mechanics in early gameplay are fun, somewhat challenging and requires balance.

Maybe I'll update once I've played through more, but I look forward to seeing how this game progresses.  I'm sure the reference has been made multiple times, but this feels like a rebirth of the Black and White game style with more of a simulation game feel.  I hope this is or becomes a large element to the game as it progresses, both in gameplay progression and game development, because it was a really fun component in that style of game.  That is, if the developers want to take the project in that direction ;)

My reasons being that it's been in the Alpha stage for a long time; longer than what they initially said from what I've been told. The next reason is that some of the issues are just silly and not in a good way. Don't get me wrong I'm still enjoying the game but it is still frustrating in some regards.

The main thing that has bothered me from the first time that I played it (it's been off and on with their updates) was the research tree. I'm not sure who was behind it but they clearly didn't think it through. I mean who in their right mind thought you needed to research electricity before you could have a hunter's lodge? Or a blacksmith? Or a WORKING GOVERNMENT? I could keep going but you probably get my point by now.
Another point that attributes to the research tree would be the buildings that come with it. Why would you give the option to create certain buildings when you don't even have the research to get the necessary resources to build them? It makes no sense and it was frustrating.

One of the things that I did enjoy however was how at first it really felt like you were taking care of a baby since you had to do almost everything for them but as time went on and the civilization began to get more technology and developed leadership roles, they began to do things on their own. It was fascinating seeing that from a god-like perspective. It got to the point where instead of NEEDING to help the nuggets I only helped them because I wanted to. There were issues here and there due to the research tree's inadequacy (like not being able to have any law enforcement without electricity because that makes sense) but that was quickly solved with me throwing lightning bolts into the crowds of protesters and healing those that they (and possibly me on occasion) hurt.

Regardless, like I said I still recommend playing this if you enjoy god games or at least keeping an eye on its development. From creating the big bang and finding the right planet to create life; I'm barely scratching the surface with a lot of the things I talked about here. There are ups and downs; hopefully there will be less by the time they decide to officially release this.",1573449112,1573449112,True,21,3,0.678625643253326416,0,True,False,True

My biggest complaint is the amount of downtime you have...
Most players will have a simple goal of avoiding a tedious amount of micro-managing. You'll quickly get into the swing of things and basically roll with your ""nuggets"" and rate they expand. Pretty cut and dry, some dynamics that caution you from expanding too much all at once which then becomes a game of managing your rate of expansion vs. materials needed. fun stuff! 

 ANYWHO! The amount of downtime stretches into HOURS of quite literally nothing but your resources balancing with your birthrates which are all automated. In some cases, a higher population aids a great deal of advancing your civilization... but so many people are moving so many resources and there are so many bugs that literally keeps your priority buildings stagnant for even LONGER! at 600+ population with a majority being a labor force, you would anticipate at least 1 building being built within a minute or two... there will be about an hour where nothing is getting done because they are evenly dividing out resources for whatever they feel is more important than their LITERAL GOD commanding them. There doesn't appear to be a certain order in which they build... I will have stone age buildings never being upgraded, but if I place a new construction project in the modern era phase, they will collectively mob it until it's built... This doesn't feel as random at first, until you start needing factories! I cannot express how frustrating it is mainly due to the fact that the raw materials required to make more advanced materials TAKE FUCKING FOREVER to gather. You cannot prioritize where these materials go... they simply are taken by whatever laborer gets to them first and decides where it belongs... either in a project you set up or their new house at the edge of some where you were hoping they wouldn't build.

This game is still very fun...  but the more you progress, the more you expand, the more the game simply feels like it can't handle it's own mechanics. The emergency network that is supposed to have citizens RUSH to safety. It works for maybe... 100 of them? It's difficult to keep track of. The AI will literally run into danger. A tornado blasting through your civilization will get a kill count without effort as nuggets just dive into it. Also, every single play through I have played the bunker glitches and does not ever release the citizens inside. I had to destroy the structures. 

I firmly believe this game was designed for people to rush through it. It hasn't tested for people, like me, who take their time and rather enjoy a lot of the details and seeing how far they can go. If my society began collapsing on itself, I would understand that I mismanaged my resources, my birthrates, just fucking it all up, but this feels like this is not the case.

All in all, I'm pretty sure the devs are working on a better balance to these ""specific"" issues. 

The game is still great to play! you tell they took their time through the stone age as that has been the most fun part of the game so far... it's also the most extensive area.

As with all unfinished titles, there are some flaws and bugs but after 10 hours, nothing game-breaking has occurred. Overall, I didn't notice anything bad except a minor drop in performance as I reached modern times (3rd and currently last civilisation stage). I can not relate to other reviews or comments regarding loads of game-breaking or visual bugs.

The gameplay reminds me a lot of the good old Black & White mixed with Empire Earth 1. It's like a perfect blend of some of my all time favourite games from a long time ago. However, Universim is refreshing and new, adding in some new aspects (intricate research tree), keeping some old tradition (smite them with lightning!) and appears in a cute and cartoon-ish look. 
There's some humour in the game through the narrator but I think it's in the correct amount as to not get annoying or ridiculous. It actually made me smile several times and added to the cuteness of the game.

The current state of the game can only be guessed by me now, as I have not seen any sort of roadmap. There's a lot of stuff to do on your home planet already which includes: Building your civilisation from the stone age up to the space age. Manage (assisted by your minions) your workers and city. Trade or fight with ""exile"" cities that rise on other parts of the planet. Use your godly powers for good or for evil. Build a sustainable civilisation or raid the planet of everything it got and ditch it for a new one later? Youcan currently choose through research branches how you want to develop you civilisation and affect the planet.
Overall, a variety of systems is already in place and it is to be hoped that they will gain in depth further on. According to the developers we will see interplanetary colonisation (maybe because we killed mother planet through our poor choices) and some sort of alien threat. 

Even though it's not finished, The Universim is a lot of fun to play already. For me, I did not encounter any serious problems within 10 hours of playtime and I had tons of fun getting to know the game. It takes little time to get used to and explains itself through tooltips and narrator hints quite well.

Pros:
- possui grafico bonito, a arte do game é muito boa
- a interação do narrador com você
- vários easter eggs no jogo
- a forma como o seu povo se organiza para construir suas casas é bem legal.
- o surgimento de problemas ao longo do game, como outras facções, UFOs, desastres naturais
- o progresso e mudanças que você deve gerir ao longo da vida do teu povo
- nova interação com a twitch para streamers

Contra:
- Pesado, muito pesado o jogo, principalmente a medida que sua civilização cresce fica insustentável jogar
- Demorado, o jogo é lento, mesmo com a velocidade máxima demora 2-3hrs apenas para ter o básico, com umas 5-6 horas você estará na metade da arvore de evolução. Resultado, novas jogatinas é extremamente desanimador.
- a mesma interação do autor após 50x fica chata.
- cumprir as quests são quase obrigatórias para ter uma boa progressão, pois desbloqueiam construções que influenciam em muito a segurança e felicidade.
- IA meio bugada durante desastres naturais, você vê mesmo com alarme soando ninguém indo até os bunkers
- bugs, mas é normal para jogos em early access, então da pra relevar.
- falta de explicações ingame de mecanicas do jogo, como a função dos ministros.

I find the graphics visually appealing, and though some have criticized the graphics as being too 'cartooney', I don't see that as a bad thing for a quirky god game. I have shared the frustration associated with updates and patches that don't seem to come 'soon enough', but I remind myself, that I can experiment with different aspects of game play while I'm waiting for the updates.  For example, I might play a game paying extra attention to building placement and experimenting with the research tree. On another play I might focus on increasing population and selective nugget breeding, and during other plays, I'll take what I learned and mix the strategies together. I'll also spend time experimenting with creator powers on the environment (I JUST learned that one can take down a flying saucer with two lightning bolts, and get a mystery box!).

I have a couple minor gripes: When I get a message saying that a nugget got injured, I try to click on the nugget's name before it scrolls out of sight, so that I may be 'flown' to the nugget to help it. Unfortunately, the name tends to scroll away before I can click on it, requiring me to drag the text back to reveal the name, and then try to click on it before it disappears again. it would save me some frustration to have a stationary icon to click to be flown to the event.

Another thing that throws me off is that I normally move around the world by left-clicking and dragging, but once I've picked up (teleported) an item, I will drop it the moment I attempted to move around by left-clicking/dragging. In those instances, it feels awkward using the arrow keys to move the item around the world.

One thing that I would like to see in the game is a way to 'bookmark' locations on the planet. Sometimes I'll be searching the planet and see an item or feature that I would like to visit again, but I have no way of tagging the location so that I may easily return.

Other than my micro gripes, I think this is a very entertaining game, and I look forward to seeing where it goes.",1570997368,1570997497,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It plays fine for a little while, and then all your nuggets will freeze or stop building & moving.

The art and humor dialogue is placed well. Learning to balance the system of a planet is quite interesting.
There is one thing that would be personally wanted, but can understand it would make another layer or complicated animation to put in the game. However, would like to domesticate foxes, wolves, or mammoths to breed for riding and companionship to other planets as well. Maybe also getting the genetic cloning, just in case of losing numbers due to over hunting. The attacking villages that branch off on their own can be somewhat fun and irritable.

Would recommend, if liking a ""god-like game"" or controlling the behavior of a population. There are a LOT of layers and can be a bit slow at times if running a lower processing computer.

I play what is here, then play other things until another content patch....like Sky-High drops, and then I play some more. Love having the chance to play a game as it develops.

So, a quick overview of the game in the current state as of the writing of this review:
PROS
+ Intelligent, organic, self-evolution makes it seem as though your nuggets (citizens) truly have agency of their own in such a way that I have not yet experienced replicated by any other game within this genre.
+ Stylized art give this game a distinctive look that matches the tone and mechanics perfectly.
+ The sense of humor employed by those at Crytivo is a hilarious balance of playful jabs and carefree cynicism and fits perfectly with what would otherwise be a frightening allegory to situations we face in real world society and is found abundantly throughout the game's text, audio clips, and mechanics.
+ Ambient noise and sound clips make the world feel alive and even bustling in the late game, with a well-composed soundtrack that is soothing and well suited for long playthroughs.
+ Your role of Creator (a 'god') feels truly mystifying and impactful, from the single click at the beginning of a game to create the entire procedurally generated universe to using your powers do everything from acting as Cupid to even being able to completely rotate the entire planet to change seasons.
CONS
- The wonderful narrator is sometimes overly repetitive (improved with updates) and eventually peters out in the late game, losing a great virtual companion that is so endearing at the beginning of the game.
- Quests, exile (rival) faction interactions, and necessity for strategic variety are limited, which can cut short replayability after playthroughs begin entering into the double digits.
- There are some elements that are on the roadmap (like modern roads) that haven't been added because of the crunch to get the game to the stage where more important factors, like colonizing other planets, has taken such precedence. This is something I don't see being a problem in the long run, so take this criticism with a grain of salt, but it has gotten a lot of attention from a large part of the Universim community that would be more content having the game development finish one stage at a time, rather than rushing the main objectives and leaving the game feeling a little unfinished throughout the evolution of your civilization leading up to the space age.

Again, this is only criticism and praise that is applicable as of this time of writing and I don't suspect that many of the problems listed will continue into the finished product, but seeing as Steam users have been burned before by games that enter Early Access hell, it is always a possibility that they may persist. I suggest we be patient and respectful to this very communicative development team as it is plainly evident that they have poured a great deal of love and sweat into this project to make it the great game that it already is. I post this as a current fan, but I hope that what I say here can be seen as helpful and reliable to anyone considering getting this game.",1570767929,1570768327,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The best way to describe is like carefully nuturing a more-human-like colony of ants. The towns you build feel charming and lived in. Enjoying the experience so far, and the joy of early access is, you don't know what's coming next, but, with these guys, you can guess it's going to be good.
Keep up the good work Crytivo team.

Buy this. 100%.

Yes the developments are kinda slow, but they are solid. On the title it says ""Early Access Game"", if you can't read or have not went to proper English class, never buy this game as this will damage your fragile brain.

The anger I get as a player is that players giving negative reviews because they 1) acknowledged the game is still being developed. 2) Thought development is done within days 3) never read updates, news , community forum to understand how transparent the company is 

Enough frustrations towards immature gamers. Reason to buy this game:
1) No God-game available in the market (Godism does not count)
2) Amazing 3D graphics for a City builder
3) Monthly updates- they expand the tech tree, assets, tech era almost every month
4) Constant communication from the company on what they are currently developing (you see the houses, the water system images on facebook and what not)
5) A game that have huge potential, and listens to the community in regards to upcoming content

6) This is the MOST IMPORTANT- Read the their Facebook post about Blizzard. Devs are cool people, they care what's going on in the industry, not just the game itself, or ""how much money I can milk"".

7) Updates are free. Well you paid for the early access, and the updated content did not charge you a single dollar, unlike some companies which brand it as a ""DLC"" and ask you to pay.

TLDR:
Cool concept. Cool Graphics. Good dev dudes / girls / whatever they declared themselves as.
Transparent communication. Regular updates for free. Cares about the community AND the what's going on in the industry.

Bottom line is that I find the game quite enjoyable and I would and have recommended it to friends but, it is not without flaws. 
I’ve been fortunate enough to play The Universim for the better part of a year or so and have watched it develop. During that time, I’ve had to restart the game over numerous times. Some of the times have been due to updates (more about that in a moment) and some of it due to having a learning curve. 
Updates have included automation for the game, aliens, new buildings, design upgrades, basic tutorials, more quests, buildings and so on so forth. While the game is in early access, the amount of content being added is quite remarkable and as a result, it has kept me engaged enough to want to repeatedly play the game over and over (despite the fact that I have to start a new file each time). With each new system added, the game provides another layer of thought. What I mean by this is that it no longer feels like arbitrary placement of buildings and mass stripping of resources that are found in so many games (looking at you RTS games).  

As mentioned, the game has some flaws. The first is that the AI is lacking. There is an option for your minions (nuggets) to manage resources and development of the games growing culture but they fail miserably. Have a water shortage? Don’t have your nuggets fix it, they wont even if you ask them to. Want to trade resources? You won’t find any that you want. While this happens, the AI is inconsistent in that it either wipes out the culture with ufo’s or leaves the culture completely untouched. All these flaws are minor however and don’t take away from the game playing experience.
Bottom line, it’s an enjoyable game with plenty of replay ability.

Only downside at the moment is that with every update your old save becomes incompatible. This means you have to start from the very beginning to enjoy the new features. Unfortunately most of the new features are farther along as they keep adding on to the end of the game. For example the medieval  time period was the last of the progression when I first got the game. The next patch introduced modern times which obviously comes after medieval times, but I had to start a whole new civilization to enjoy the new modern times.

I am not saying all the bad reviews are not to be trusted but only the ones that come from people who think that it is abandoned, don't trust those reviews(although older ones may say that because there was a period of time where there was no updates mainly for various reasons).

I started playing Universim in its first betas, back before medieval architecture or electricity was even invented by the developers. I instantly fell in love with the game because I've been looking for God/management games for so long and have always struggled finding ones I'd enjoy. It can be a little frustrating at times, seeing annoying bugs (for example, for over 3 patches my residential buildings would not upgrade to modern ones) and having to wait over a month for an update just to restart the whole civilisation. But I'd like to remind everyone that this is Early Access and this is what we've signed up for as the game is still being constantly developed and changed. The creators have been very responsive to the public, addressing the bugs and implementing suggested changes.

Overall, if you don't mind occasional bugs, or waiting for updates, this is a great and entertaining game that you should definitely try if you like God games.

Even after all 25 hours to date, I still haven't turned him off. He's sort of a more good-natured version of the narrator you'd find in something like Dungeon Keeper. The tech tree doesn't make much logical sense and I can't decide if I like it's nonsense or not, but it certainly suits the tone of the game. The game seems to be missing certain things, though that could be just part of it not being finished. For example, there are no modern roads in the game, or cars, which is weird considering I can go to space.

If you want to play a good god, there's not a lot for you to do that's really god like. You get more points over time to use on powers, but there's not a lot of use for those powers. I usually end up just skipping most winters. Or randomly dropping animals from the stratisphere. Even when I do, no one believes in me. Using any power that could destroy something gives you evil points, even if I'm just using lightning to charge some batteries. At least if I play evil I can sacrifice the unbelievers for mana and use it to rain lightning on the exile heathens.

The game itself is solid and has made steady progress over the year or so that I've owned it. Development hasn't been without it's hiccups. I can tell the devs are under a lot of pressure to show results. For example, some features come out before they really have any use or purpose. (Such as buildings that do nothing.)

Pro's:
- You get to build a civilization from beginning of nuggetkind to the modern age to colonization of other worlds (not yet)
- God powers are fun to mess with, ha
- Amusing to kill innocent nuggets ""accidentaly""
- Stunning visuals and textures.

Cons:
- The sharpness of the textures is kind of bothersome but overall you can pretty much forget about it, would like to see a smoothening feature like anti aliasing added or something.
- The worlds as of writing this review are a bit small for the size of the civilization you're going to build.
- You get pretty big in size of your civilization pretty fast
- It's not a finished game yet ( duh, early access and stuff lol )

Cons
- research times.
- lack of narriator quotes late game.

- lack of reason to be evil god.
- Hard to keep followers late game, but it still have large amount of followers.

My favorite thing about The Universim is all the little details; the walking paths that appear between buildings, the little notes on the loading screen like ""Sharpening wolves' teeth"". I also love the ""God"" voice that helps you out and makes witty comments.

However, the list of problems is much longer:
1) It would be really great if there were some way to rotate the camera angle.
2) The zoom function is way too touchy. There should be something between 5 feet from the ground and being in outer space.
3) I like the fact that we can see the different weather patterns that occur on the planet, but I find having rain drops on the corners of the screen super distracting.
4) It would be good if the loading screen showed the actual loading progress. right now it's hard to tell if the game is actually loading or if it's just stuck in a loop.
5) The whole game is pretty laggy. the view is often pixelated and camera movement is really jerky.
6) I've been experiencing a glitch where some of my nuggets' huts are stuck in constant reproductive mode, yet no offspring are being produced.
7) The previous problems are relatively minor, but this one is actually a big deal. I can't save my progress on the game. The autosave function provided by the archive only works sometimes and even if it does work, the automatic saves are not always there when I re-open the game. this can sometimes cost me hours of work. Additionally, the manual save also doesn't work. For some reason I am unable to type in a name for the save which seems to be preventing me from saving my progress manually. Because of this, I have to wait for the autosave to happen and then hope that my progress will still be there when I come back. 

Overall, I think this game has a lot of potential but its not where it needs to be yet. I'm excited to see how the game continues to improve.

If you, like me, saw the $30 price tag and thought this might be close to a complete game, think again. This has potentially got YEARS to go before its good. Stay away.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When I read this again I felt like that just sounded angry, and needed a lot more support.

The game is a real time city builder for which the speed up time effect doesn't work yet (and is desperately needed). Research happens in real time without even the option to speed up via perks or buildings (at least not that I managed to unlock in a mind-numbingly long 8 hour game). Right now things take so long to happen that most of the game has to be played idly while watching or doing something else to occupy your thoughts.

Beyond time management, the technology system is a mess. You get electicity before you can upgrade out of stone huts, but then you can't actually use electricity for eons after you unlock it for some reason. Certain unlocks make it impossible to build cheaper buildings, requiring huge amounts of refined resources that take far too much time and manpower for balance purposes right now. (It's better to never upgrade a lot of the buildings and just build lots of cheap, old ones). 

The God Powers that exist right now are crappy and uninspired. You'll only ever really use Telekenesis  (Which the VO refers to exclusively as ""Levitate"" which is confusing), and the one that makes them fall in love (It's called like Cupidus or something). Almost all the other powers are basically useless right now, or are way too expensive for the tiny benefit they offer. It makes you feel less like a God and more like a guy who can occasionally perform menial tasks.

Resource management is frustrating as hell. The Water has no problem filling refineries, but your labor nuggets have no idea how to get lumber from the west end of town to the east end no matter how many or few warehouses you have.

Like I said all of this is fixable, but when you have these many core issues going on, and more than 50% of your researches still say ""Coming soon"" then it seems to me like it's a long way from being complete. If this game were $10 I might say to check it out, and maybe hold on a year or 2 until it's ready, but at $30 this game is basically already selling at what's going to be all it's worth.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I still don't recommend this game. The time increase only goes to 1.5x, which means you'll be spending huge amounts of time doing absolutely nothing, or leaving the room to let this run in the background. The pacing is just so slow, and with nothing to do but spin the globe around while you wait, this game really sucks at the beginning. I don't know if it ever gets worth playing, but what's the point if you're gonna have to slog through a complete lack of interactivity for the first hour + of gaming?",1537704523,1569341945,False,11,0,0.454270601272583008,0,True,False,True
352720,55253797,76561198063505966,0,1,10010,0,2213,1682776459,"Though I've only spent around 36 hours in the game, I feel like I've been playing it much longer. And after having to restart approximately four times in order to experience the many new updates, I've decided to send another post. I enjoy the game, even with the many bugs that happen late game, and I'd definitely recommend it to other people who enjoy a relaxing type of game. It is full of quirky moments early in game with the narrator telling you this and that, as well as pop-up messages that make things slightly more comedic. 

But this is a review. There are still many things I think could be better, and the main point of this is that as you progress to the late game, it doesn't seem to be anymore of a God-Game than it is a Civilization builder. The idea of it was great at the start, but I feel as though as you progress you become less of a God and more of a spectator. (This could also potentially be the developers plan; to allow your Nuggets to proceed on their own without any diety interference). 

I truly feel as though there could, and should, be more things that the player can unlock as they proceed within the game. It is a great city-builder game in its rights, but as the summary states, ""A new breed of God Game"". With that, many would purchase it with the idea that you'd be able to do more God-like things, instead of the continuous cycle of putting out fires, smiting aliens, moving things around, and things of the sort. It seems new until that's all you've been doing the entire game.

One could ask, ""What's the point of temples?"" ""Do they just use up potential laborers?"" And for the most part, that's what it seems to be. What I hope to see is an actual purpose for the temples. Such as converting other Nuggets to believe, or being able to unlock more God-Like abilities. It gives the player a reason to continue trying to earn followers instead of just building and moving things around, or spamming a Jolt of Joy to raise believer counts.

And then there's the bugs. It isn't an issue in the early game, and I understand that this is a work-in-progress of a game itself, but there are many things that seem to be overlooked overall. As you get further into the game (particularly after researching everything available) I've come across many bugs. One involves Nuggets completing buildings without the proper resources. I've been able to build many Modern buildings (including the Space Center) without having a Glass Factory in place, which, if you know the late game, is essential for most Modern Buildings. Another bug involves a fire (which I had set) in an aggressive village that didn't disappear (even with the Trickle Effect ability) until I had to reload the game from a last save point. They're somewhat minor bugs, but it really makes things a little weird. Plus the Nuggets being stuck in locations that they can't seem to get out of (mainly near the temple as they climb down) and then either get moved by me, or die of dehydration.

Overall, to me, I find this game to be enjoyable even with the many flaws. It's under development after all, and I truly hope to see it continue to grow and become what its potential laid out for it. It's a God-Game, and I truly hope for that to continue in the mindset of the developers. As great of a City-Builder it is, it definitely has much potential for it to be an amazing God-game. I look forward to seeing the next update, hopefully less about building and more about what all the player can do. ;D",1569288966,1569288966,True,13,0,0.653845548629760742,0,True,False,True

The main problems are;
as the population grows my pc takes a huge performance hit, every building I place seems to exponentially lower frame rate to the point the game is unplayable, needs some kind of optimisation urgently.

when the population gets big they seem to stop building and upgrading structures, perhaps because they are busy gathering the food and moving it acroos a vast city? If this is the cause perhaps a method to limit the food gathered as a percentage of the population (for example when food stored = 2 x annual consumption switch to production tasks. Prioritise at this point doesnt seem to get those important buildings finished and they just sit there.

Aside from that it would be cool to see more diplomatic options for dealing with neighbours, buildings to boost science research, population limiters (everything seems to be geared up towards producing as many nuggets as possible but this uncontrolled explosive growth seems to be the main cause of societal collapse, perhaps government policies to encourage discourage or limit child reproduction).

这游戏这么久了，还是有一种盲目发展的感觉。游戏上手让人不知所措，相比文明，这边的建造发展给人感觉影响更小，完全不能带来发展的感觉。很多时候就只是完成建造了、完成研究了，但是完全没有成就感，因为看不出任何明显的变化。但是把玩家的“神之力”抬的非常高，造成玩家替ai发展的假象。结果就是玩个几分钟，就不知道为什么要玩了。非常可惜的游戏，如果能类似文明一样营造一种历史感，允许玩家站在第三方的角度看文明发展，会更有意思。",1535546978,1568983986,True,1,2,0.457152098417282104,0,True,False,True

You play as the Creator / God of a race of creatures called nuggets, which are like little humans. 

You guide them through the various ages of history, beginning in a stone-age, working up through medieval, early-modern, modern, and space-age (Space-Age is yet-to-be-added though). 

You have a whole planet to utilize currently, with colonization planned during the space-age. 

As for obstacles in your civilization's way, you have several things that can potentially kill off your nuggets.
-Winter : it freezes water so your collectors won't collect any and your civilization has to rely on stored water. Also farms don't produce during Winter of course, meaning your only source of food is what your hunters hunt. 
-Animals : Wolves and Bears can and do kill your nuggets if you let them get too close.
-They recently added UFOs that can abduct them. You get a counter-measure against this in the Space-Age era. 
-Hostile Tribes can attack your village, though you can help out with your God-Powers to defeat them. 

You also have a set of God-Powers, which includes

-Making it Rain
-Telekinesis
-Making two Nuggets make Love
-fast forwarding a season (Skip Winter if you want)
-Make a Fire
-Plant Trees
-Cause a Tornado (Sending one on a Rival Village is fun XD)
-Make Lightning Strike where you want it to hit. 
-Make your nuggets work faster.

And disappointed-ly the reviewer hold his review until this day and not publishing it. So, maybe I'll give a little bit of insight of the game for what is good and what is bad, and what needs to be reworked after I bought the game myself. Some bugs and errors are still there, obviously because this game is an early access. And I'm sorry for my bad english, I'm not native.

So this is what I've experienced:

[b]The good[/b]
1. Detailed civilization system with upgrades of technologies. Unfortunately [b]its not yet got technology to go to space at this time of writing.[/b] Yes, I'm using cheat to explore the game's features so it may looks that my hours of play is too short.
2. Very good voice acting for narrative. Feels like I'm being a kid that being told a night-time story before sleep. Love it!
3. Refreshing theme, a god game as a concept.
4. Great visual. I love cartoony graphics.
5. Relaxing music.
6. A lot of challenges but still keeping you to relax and play the game.

[b]The bad[/b]
1. God doesn't need to set an example of what building to make by making some building. I think you lost the essence of god game and just trying to be a city builder game. If you're consistent with your vision, you dont need to give the option to make some building.
2. The nuggets still dumb, they still drink dirty water even I have built some well. They also can't go to hospital by themselves and I must guide them too. They also dont have any own thoughts that they must study to be more intelligent even if I have built some school.
3. I dont know why, but it seems God still and must take care of nuggets' simple needs like water purifier etc. A God game that's not God at all. To put it simple: I am God, not mayor of the city. Why should I care about something simple like that? You are my creation and gifted with abilities to think as I as God have unlocked your own abilities. God only interference with problems that human doesn't know how to resolve and ""help"" them silently. For example love. The developer knew it so I thought its a good idea to give us as player ability to make some nuggets couple. But not helping them by providing building. No.

[b]The things I think should be fixed[/b]
1. Bugs obviously, I still detect one of my nugget after I annihilate them all but after I tracked it, it shows nothing. Just tracked arrow that shows that the nugget still alive. In reality its not there.
2. As I said before, I'm using cheat/trainer to explore its features. So, here's what I found after maxed all the technologies:
- If you annihilate your civilization with meteor swarm, your nuggets can't build new building because its lack of requirements or maybe they didnt want to. For example, even if you got a lot of resources and reach a nanotechnology age, your nuggets cant even build a simple well or water pump. Or they feel they wont build it, so you can't restart your civilization because the building is all advanced. Seems developer forgot about this.
- The tracker also need to be fixed, for example some quest/challenges said that the nugget named X had their problem and nugget that report that X is guilty wants you to make action. BUT, after I search the X name, I found nothing! Yes, NOTHING! But the challenge still go-on. I dont know if this kind of bug or something, but this needs to be fixed. This buried the essence that God is almighty and knows everything. NO, GOD CANNOT DO THAT IN THIS GAME! 

[b]Bonus: Things that maybe interesting if the developers want to add[/b]
[b]1. Religion[/b] 
As you can see in the bible or religious bible in each religion. You know there's a messiah among each religion in real life. Maybe you can add religion in this game. Some nuggets needs to be a messiah of god, false god or maybe an evil occult. This is god game afterall so, I think its more fun to adding some of those. If the developers said that this game is a city building I wouldn't mind you didn't add the religion. You dont need to add it to replicate the real religion. Just add some fictional religion and fictional things so it doesnt need to be real.
[b]2. S-e-x-u-al Orientation[/b]
The world is grows as people s-e-x-u-a-l orientation goes. Maybe add some of it doesn't hurt right?
[b]3. Conflicts[/b]
War (earth or galactic), mob of protest to their politician, plague, etc 

For the time being, I'm still recommend the game for those who loves city building game with ""god-ly"" elements on it. I have played a lot of city building game in the past (unfortunately I played it offline because the internet is something luxurious here in the past) and found this game is refreshing for its theme but needs a lot of improvement. Especially for those who didn't want to manage the complexity of city building or simulation game and wants to be relaxed a little bit.

Just be aware that the game is still in early access. So you must understand that there are a lot of things that needs to be fixed, changed, or add.",1568421651,1568422199,True,5,0,0.56937795877456665,0,True,False,True

And I do love it as a city builder, so the only real reason for the negative review is that it feels a bit like false advertising, it reqlly should be marketed as a city builder, not a god game. I will change mg review if they add more powers or fix their advertising.

Things this game gets right:
The graphical style is a bit cartoony for me, but I enjoy the freedom it allows for.  When making a game where you have to deal with things like being smitten by a divine being, or what happens when you become smitten with the woman in the adjacent hut, a developer has to be careful to make the game look and feel real without being TOO real, I suppose, so in the end, I enjoy it in spite of how silly it seems at times.
How refreshing it is to finally be able to PLAY a god game.  Recent entries into this subgenre of simulation games have almost all been entirely too passive.  Games like Godhood and Crest have made some waves, but they leave the player with a sense that either the game is playing itself, or the choices you're making matter very little.  The simple addition of the Creator Powers in Universim gives us all a chance to meaningfully interact with the world, while still feeling as though we're an omnipotent being watching over helpless mortals. (Thank you for not adopting the gesture system from Black and White or something similar, by the way...much appreciated) Overall, the game strikes an excellent balance between moments where you can sit back and watch a civilization grow while still giving you enough to do to maintain a healthy level of progress.
I also enjoy that in later stages of the game, you effectively delegate mundane maintenance and development tasks to your nuggets so you can focus on development, research, and your own goals for the game without needing to perpetually micromanage every tiny injury or illness that befalls a worker that walks across the planet to harvest an herb.
Overall, I'm delighted to see where the developer takes this title as it promises to (finally) deliver on some promises the gaming industry offered up a LONG time ago for this style of game. (I'm talking to you, Spore!)  Assuming this title doesn't go the way of Godus (and I have little reason to believe that it will), I eagerly await every update and the eventual completion of this title.

Things I'd like to see improved:
Every title (especially one in an Early Access program) has room for improvement.  Here are some things I think would benefit this game greatly. (Recognizing that it is unfinished and the developer may already have some of this in mind.)

Gameplay-
Some of the progress you make as the game progresses leaves some bizarre circumstances that are a bit jarring.  Having electricity available while relying on a lone guy atop a rickety stone and wood tower to tell you whether or not your civilization will soon succumb to a tornado, for instance.  I think some shuffling of the upgrades to make the game feel more natural in the development of your citizens is in order.  This would give the feeling that you're progressing more naturally through the ages.
Stone Huts are a great ""caveman"" start, but there are definitely some steps in between a stone hut and a tudor house.  It'd also be nice if these constructions were upgradeable.  For example, a Stone Hut might be enough for a couple and their two children, but growing a family beyond that point might require a wooden structure (still a dirt floor, but enough space for another couple of kids to help with chores/farming, etc.)  At the very least, if you're satisfied with going directly from stone huts to tudor homes, then perhaps there should be a ""demolish"" button on the stone huts to allow you to ""encourage"" the occupants to build a modern home?
When placing a town center for the first time on a new world, you have no information aside from a visual inspection of the environment.  Information like the temperature under the cursor and such would be quite useful when initially placing your town.  On the extreme end, you might even give a sort of ""heat map"" for settlement viability factoring in resource/water availability and temperature, etc... (very long term WANT, not a NEED).  Additional information could help new players start in a better location and may even allow veterans to challenge themselves better.

Sound-
While the music is good for this kind of game, the sound effects and audio alerts could use some visual assistance to be meaningful.  An example is a wolf attack.  You might hear the alert horn blaring from somewhere and the narrator will tease you about how delectible your nuggets are to the local fauna, but without some kind of contextual arrow directing you to the source of these alerts, you might lose several nuggets before you're able to queue up the Zeus-bolts and make some wolf burgers.
The wind-tunnel noise that plays as you're panning across your vast civilization to get to your next project should be scaled back significantly.  perhaps only playing when at extremely high altitudes (much higher than present) and maybe only after you've been ""flying"" for a period of time.  I do a lot of scanning back and forth and find myself annoyed by how ear-shattering that sound is.

UI-
I feel it is important to mention again that I recognize the game is in the early stages and that much of this is subject to change.  Still, I feel it worth mentioning things that I would like to see change before they are solidified. 
Icons: One per item, please.  At present, if you choose to upgrade a warehouse, you can see two different icons within the same window for the three different resources required.  The left hand icon is the colored icon present at the bottom of the screen, and within the upgrade portion of the window, you see the white mini-icons present in many other areas.  At the very least, the white mini-icons should be essentially monochrome versions of the colored icons (same shape/style), and ideally, I'd like to see only one of the two types used (the colored icons being the choice I'd make).  This is also an issue when trading with a neighbor, as you see yet ANOTHER version of the resource icon when in that interface (most obvious example being gas.)
Unit Cards: When inspecting a nugget, it might be useful to see some additional information at a glance.  For instance, if I find a corpse in the woods, it might be nice to know if an animal killed them or they died of thirst because I hadn't built enough wells near them. Being able to click on the name of a person's spouse in their unit card and see the spouse's card would be nice as well.
Building Upgrades: If it's present, I can't find it...but the game desperately needs a way to upgrade ""all of type"" on a building.  Finding every little hole in the ground I've made to quench the thirst of my people amidst the sea of stone huts is tiresome.  Adding the ability to order the upgrading of every version of the building i'm currently upgrading would be quite welcome!
Map Overlays:  While I don't feel the game needs to go so far as games like Tropico or SimCity have done in their overlays, It might be nice to be able to see things like temperature and happiness in a kind of colored overlay that allows you to identify trouble areas and take appropriate action.  This could also be useful for things like polution, limited resource quantities, etc.  The game itself can get pretty busy visually especially in the late game, so something like this can be extremely useful.
This has already gotten more verbose than intended, so I'll stop there.

TL:DR - Worth Buying...if you're even remotely interested in this style of game, take Crest and Godhood off your wishlist and buy this one!",1568036634,1568036634,True,17,1,0.685873210430145264,0,True,False,True

this game is a game witch will take time to become bug FREE don't be angry if you lose hours of progress when you play the game is an EARLY ACCESS game . the dev's update the game about once every 1-2 months with a large bug fix and throw in a bit of new content in the mix. every 3-4 months there's a major update witch adds in a ton of new content like a new age such as the most recent witch was the modern age . personally i lost an entire save with multiple hours on it around feb and it wouldn't  load it up and it would give an infinite loading screen but since then the bug was patched 


GAMEPLAY 

the game is a slow start i would say the first hour of playing its trying to grow your first two people into a sizable amount although once you reach the end game you can research a clone factory while playing you can summon in positive or negative things such as a disaster or make two nuggets make love but in my opinion the end game it the best you get to build wonders and your population gets so big you can really do just about anything with them and it wont really effect them.

I enjoy the expansion of the early ages and I think the ministers are a cool idea, but sometimes they use a lot of resources for redundant purposes, especially the minister of education, who insists on building 5 universities in her first 10 minutes on the job. I also noticed that travel distance is calculated based on lines and doesn't take environmental features into account. For example, I started next to a lake. When I expanded, eventually the other side of the lake was closer to the center of my civ than the surrounding countryside, so nuggets circumnavigated the lake and set up homes very far from the amenities of the city and inevitably starve, die of dehydration, and start fires. Also I've noticed that rival tribes stay weak but continue demanding tribute. One even announced they were going to raid my town but ended up dying right as they left theirs and started attacking a group of hunters nearby.

Another few random gripes are that buildings are really hard to tell apart, especially in the beginning so I just have to go around clicking on like 10 different building to find the one i actually want.

The buildings aesthetics don't match sometimes, getting worse the farther you progress. I'm in the medieval age and i have a modern looking university for example.

When an alert pops up like a nugget breaking a bone or drinking river water, there's no option to jump to where it happened.

The sound of a meteor hitting the planet literally shakes my headphones it's so loud. The sound levels in general are inconsistent.

The AI factions basically don't progress at all.

+Hilarious commentator.
+Pretty game.
+Really relaxed play style.

Cons
- Some of the nuggets build houses in very weird places. When you reach medieval times it seems to get weirder and they go miles away. Being able to toggle on/off auto build would be nice.
- The tech tree is kind of funny. We get electricity, power plants and drill for oil before Tudor housing. 
- Sometimes my nuggets just won't build roads for some reason.
- A few game crashes (nothing too bad).
- Hunting you need to select a new trap every 15 minutes and if you don't they won't hunt. I always forget so I don't use the hunters' huts. It would be nice for them to auto-build traps.
- It would be nice to build bridges. I had a settlement next to a really thin bit of lake and the nuggets were walking around the lake.",1565526219,1565527055,True,2,0,0.492082655429840088,0,True,False,True

EDIT:
The game is now playable. The fix is to wait 20~25 minutes on the loading screen after starting a new game. 

The customer support from the devs has been a very positive experience, though they continue to insist that the loading time is about 5 minutes regardless of my experience on the load screen. This 20-25 minute load time is repeatable. I have received support on this comment, on a universim thread, and via email. They seem like they want to be very helpful and that is quite awesome. 

I am playing the game and am very happy with the gameplay of the game. However, if others are in my shoes they will likely never get this opportunity as the load time paired with no feedback and a windows lockup screen mean that a lot of people will never go through the whole customer service loop to try and get a game to load. 

Changed my vote to an up thumb which likely means my further opinions don't mean much, but I really do like the game. I just hope this issue is fixed before the game is released as it locks many people out of a wonderful experience.

Recomandation for developers:

-The voiced narater is cool the first time, but it is redondant when you replay the game from the start over and over again. Maybe do something about it?

-Can we have a city hall more early to automate the city building and people placing? like a king  who rule in a castle or just a chef tent who rule clan.  it could be upgradable to had more administraters and have upgrades that affect on how fast and well they behave.

- In the city hall, the city manager is not automaticaly replaced if he die, making the city die if we don't manualy replace him in time. can you do something about it?

- Make plants reproduce and die over time, depending on the land and environement. It is a life cycle and god is not the only answer to life!

-All those watch towers and no event for them, can you fix that?


-Omg the planet froze globaly!!!  Its is a mass instinction of weak species of birds and plants. Please, Just make the planet pole freeze more or less, depending of the planet inclinaison, to save the weak animals and plant, has you alow them to migrate and reproduce.. Also, the tornado should hit where cold and hot weather meet. Not just rendumly hit any place at any time.



Bugs noted:

Game crash around 280 population, maybe because of the hell task charge i give the game.
Game crash whit auto save, when there is too mutch task on hand.
Game froze for a time when auto save in on action. it is anoying having a frozen screen.

While I have not yet had the time to continue playing, I have been notified (by the developer) that the store page description has been updated to reflect the gameplay more accurately. Upon checking, I am very satisfied with the iterations, as well as the open attitude the development team has taken towards my (quite intense) feedback. As the main reason for my review being negative was the misrepresentation on the store page, I am turning it into a positive. The game runs well, and is no longer selling itself as something it isn't. Once I have the time to play, hopefully over the coming weekend, I'll revisit my opinions regarding micromanagement.

changing the review state cancels the stats, so RIP 359 helpfuls :/

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

To preface this, indeed negative, review. If you enjoy city build games where the people decide to build houses (and only houses) themselves, you are likely to have a good time with The Universim.

The AI can get a tad wonky, but it's functional. The graphics are cute, the progression relatively logical, and the narrator is great.

That being said, this is not the god game I thought it was based on the store page and trailers.

You will be micro managing your nuggets from start to finish, determining where they build their wells, eateries, hunting lodges, watchtowers, etc. If you leave the game running for a few hours they won't go and try to develop on their own. They'll build some more houses as their population increases, but without you micro-managing their economy nothing more will happen. In this way, it is more like Banished than the God Game I expected when I threw down my money.

It feels like I've been mislead and, at worst, intentionally deceived.

The store page mentions: 

""Guide a fledgling civilization through the obstacles of life. From humble beginnings, watch as they evolve and advance throughout the ages under your wing.""

""We want to give you a feeling that you’re interacting with a living organism, almost like you’re messing around with a rather chaotic ant farm.""

These are the lines that got me to buy. They are also straight up lies. I'm not watching, I'm micro managing. I'm not messing around with an ant farm, I'm telling the worker ants exactly how they should build their tunnels, where they need to go for water and food, etc. Rather than nudging a growing civilisation into something I want to see as their god, I end up filling up the planet one building at a time like a city planner.

It's only been around a month since my initial review but I feel the game is definitely moving in the right direction. There have been several sizable updates in a short time and it's clear the developers are passionate about the game.

While much of what I said before is still true (I've had two more mass extinctions from pawns forgetting how to function, making me restart the world) I do feel that there is enough fun to be had to justify the purchase if you are a fan of management games; even in this alpha state.


-OLD REVIEW-

I really want to recommend this game, but I can't as it is now. If there was a neutral rating I would give it that but In the game's current state I can't reasonable say I would recommend buying unless the sole reason is to support the devs. 

Currently, the bugs with basic underlying systems like pathing and the pawns needs management become too much to overcome in the later stages of the game. At a population of +270 every civilization I've built crashes in on itself with pawns starving to death outside eateries, pawns refusing to reproduce manually, and half of the population refusing to drink anything but dirty water causing them to get sick and all production to screech to a halt.

Yes, the game is early access so I should expect plenty of bugs, but the game is also selling for $30 as is so I'm going to judge it as a $30 experience. Right now the game is not worth $30 to me.

I honestly have high hopes for the future of this game but I regret buying it as it is now. I'll update this review once I feel the changes warrant it.",1559359787,1562450065,True,0,0,0.479445934295654297,0,True,False,True

Probably the most enjoyable god game sim i've played since black and white. Skill tree is meaningful and there is a fair amount to balance without being overwhelming.

The game feels shallow and after a few hours of playing i started to get ""No man sky"" flash backs. The game is shallow because it is trying to be a God simulator and a city builder at the same time, i'm not saying its not possible but the way Universim attempts this Multi tasking leaves there much to be desired. i'll elaborate, Universim allows you to build somethings and not others, you have to build eateries and wells etc, but you cant build the nuggets houses which leads to a cluster of things where i don't want them and my detailed city plans failing. Ok well it is also a God simulator, you get powers, cool, but whatever, they feel kinda tacked on, you can go the whole game without using them. The game itself even punishes you for using the higher point abilities, Example: A hostile village has been making demands, stealing, sending evil priests into my village, and even attacking my village, OK, the mindset of almost everyone is ""i will now wipe this boil of a society off the face of this earth"" but when you take action YOUR nuggets will then fear you which severely slows down the amount of ability points you get. 

if you haven't figured it out yet, this is kinda a rant, but one that I need to get off my chest after seeing so many positive reviews. Especially people who've reviewed the game with only 1-3 hours played. If you are like me and want to get more than 1-3 hours out of a game than don't get this one. wait for it to grow and become a full game, the developers are working hard and i'm sure they will continue to add depth to this game.
 

I will now list off things that aren't vital but pissed me off more than they should have.

-Nuggets dying of thirst/hunger in masses when im filled to capacity with food and water.

-Having stone huts, medieval houses, and modern houses all in the same city. (this totally ruined my immersion and was by far the most annoying thing)

-Having exile villages continue to survive after i've cleaned out their entire population.

-Trades? I don't even know why they're in the game.

-The stupid ass alien boxes that have killed more nuggets than plague, wolves and winter combined. (not a single red exclamation mark yet it still blows up and kills 30+  nuggets.)

I've been watching this game since it was first announced and finally (with the push of a Steam sale) picked up a copy (I was going to wait for full release but lack patience).  Not going to lie, its a little addictive if your into God Sim/City Builders.

While the game still has a few issues, it does seem that its coming along nicely. With regular updates and info from the dev's and a road plan that they seem to be hitting quite well, this increasingly looks like it will be one of the few EA games that gets full release in the state the dev's want it to be.

The game looks very nice graphically and plays well for its current state. While I did state there are still a few issues, the dev's appear happy to take feedback and endeavour to fix what they can.

What I've played so far had me a little concerned, as one minute I checked the time and it was 1:30 pm in the afternoon, then what felt like not very long I checked again and it was gone 8 pm in the evening. I've not lost time like that since Minecraft.  You've been warned.

But seriously, if you like the look of the game, think about picking it up and throwing some support the dev's way.

The Universim is not the same, but better in my eyes, you don't have a ""creature"" but you can do Godlike powers like healing, dropping rain or conjure a Tornado (to impress your ""Nuggets"", destroy enemies or just for fun).

Your Nuggets(People) are pretty much independent and can gain faith and believe in you, which gives you points to do your powers.
You can help them build or even just leave them be and watch them do their stupid things.

I like it that there are other villages who show up and can trade with your people or even go to war.

If you use to much water or cut down to many trees or even produce to much oil, you can litterally destroy your planet, climate change can occur.

Your Nuggets have the risk to die from hunger, wild animals, self inflicted injuries , falling rocks(meteor or thrown by you) and you can even kill your nonbelievers by simply organising them a vacation outside your planet.

Its still Early Access, but i love the idea that you can later colonise other planets.

It still has bugs of course but it doesn't refrains me from playing it, i keep looking inside and am patiently waiting every new patch, which always gives a new content.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]Very satisfying graphics, though there are a few things that need working on.
[*]Cute character designs for the nuggets, and animals' character designs are very alien and beautiful.
[*]Gameplay that will provide enough of a challenge, but still allow you to relax and unwind while playing.
[*]Interesting narrator commentary and pretty well-done sound effects.
[*]Cool little easter eggs to discover while playing and exploring your planet.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]Obviously the game is not finished, as it's in early access. There are a few points where you will run into unfinished quests, bugs, and reach dead ends. However, it still took me a few hours to reach that, and I believe there is great potential for replayability (especially when trying out new building layouts, new starting areas, etc.).
[*]Sometimes the game will give a tutorial for something that's almost not needed, but then neglect to explain other things. I ran into this most while trying to use god powers. Some may argue that tutorials aren't present for all of them because some are related to quests/puzzles and you're meant to try things out, but in other cases the controls simply aren't explained very well.
[*]Not all icons and status effects are explained well, leaving you baffled as to why a nugget won't work, mate, or do some other activity. It can be kind of frustrating, especially since the game is newer and the community doesn't have all the answers figured out.
[/list]

Overall, I would recommend this game. While it's still in early access, the game is far from broken like some early access games are. There is plenty of content available, and in the event that you do run into a dead end, there is room for replayability.",1561787521,1561787521,True,15,0,0.655211687088012695,1,True,False,True

On the one hand, there's a lot of potential here. You can see, while playing the game that the team behind it knows what they're doing. For a very early version, many parts of the game are already very streamlined. The designs, while somewhat generic, are very well-crafted. Pretty much any building can tell you what it does after just a glance at it. Not only this, but the game looks beautiful as well. 
The AI, generally speaking for how far I've come in the game, is a LOT better than what you would expect to see (heck, I'd say it's even better than some in fully released AAA games). The gameplay is a bit shallow, but it already is enjoyable enough to keep me hooked through hours of gameplay. There are little details added in a lot of aspects of the game that really show the creators of this game have expertise, and above all enjoy creating this. Things like paths slowly showing up over time as your peeps repeatedly walk over it, many of the visual flair in the game camera/perspective, the interactions between your peeps, and a lot more.

However, the flaws are plentiful. Currently, the gameplay is incredibly shallow, not only making it somewhat boring for people who are very deep into god games, but also hurting replayability (a vital component to ANY god game in my book). I would love to see some actual stats and how exactly some things influence other things. Due to all of this information being obfuscated, managing logistics is kind of a nightmare.
The tech tree in its current state is kind of a mess. Not unfixable, but still very oddly put together. It's almost satirically anachronistic, which kind of seems odd for a game that intends to simulate life (as the title says). The 'pacing' of the tech tree (and by extension, the pacing of the game) is also very strange. It feels as though you instantly jump from the neolithic to the modern era, with nothing much in between. Again, this isn't unfixable, and I'm quite sure the devs are aware of this and plan to add more to it.
The game is also unbearably slow, especially when you start off. Most of the time, you're just waiting for things to finish construction, or for your resources to get produced, or for tech research to finish. This is all pretty standard for God games, but the main problem comes from the fact that the game currently only has a highest speed of 1.5x. If I were to show this game to you, you would think 1.5 is the default game speed.

In the end, I can only recommend this to you if you are willing to spend 25 bucks on a very much unfinished game, albeit with so much potential to rival the likes of KSP and Factorio. The game is somewhat enjoyable, but currently offers little in comparison to the price you pay for it.

I, for one, am quite excited for the wild ride ahead in this game's development, and am very curious what the end product will look like.",1561769888,1561769984,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

While you do that you also have a narrator implying that you do specific things in order to gain believers. (Personally I want to remove him, what flipping God has a narrator tell them what to do? LOL! maybe just leave him in for a tutorial world or something...)

Without believers you can't be a God and perform miracles.

With believers you are using those points to maintain those believers as believers and sometimes have a few points to spare for fixing things and refilling resources, which will also promote more believers if performed with many nuggets near the miracles. 

You are not a God in this game, you are a succubus draining the faith from your population as a source of power!

My least favorite part of any city sims is road planning, so I really like that I don't have to even think about roads or paths, the AI handles it. At first I hated that I couldn't place housing myself, but as my population started to spike I was won over quickly. I really love that I don't have to micro-manage housing and the Nuggets just figure it out themselves so I can focus on more interesting things. The Nugget AI in general feels very impressive to me.
BUT the Godly powers need work.
I've accidentally smashed Nuggets, buildings, and set my city ablaze because I thought I had on the healing power when I had something else on. Wish there were some sort of ambient effect on your cursor to signal what you have active. Even just the name in small text somewhere would suffice. 
I really love the ease of opening the powers menu with the mouse, but once you have all of the powers; the monochrome menu can make it a small annoyance to scroll through to try to find the one you want.
The telekinesis power in general is pretty clunky, awkward, and downright dangerous to use. I wish I could just move a bear  somewhere else instead of touchdown-spiking it into the ground.
The healing power can feel rough to aim without a huge margin of error. It needs a way to easily see what you have targeted exactly.
The building menu; I personally don't like how it's organized, but maybe it's just me. I find that I have to look through every category and then back again to find anything nearly every time. I wish there were some form of ""eyedropper"" to copy & paste buildings already placed. Or just leaving the selection active until I'M done placing that building type. That would be super useful when I'm building 20 windmills or 20 batteries.

Overall this game is SO good, and it will easily be one of my favorite games once it's finished. I don't want to compare it to other games, but I was an enormous Black&White fan back when it came out, and even unfinished, Universim is giving me a similar sense of satisfaction I'd get from B&W that I never again got from other sim or God games.

After only one restart and barely 12 hours into the game, I've hit what appears to be the end of what content is available. But if you like god sim games, definitely follow this game and pick it up if its on sale or once it comes out of early access.

What I've seen and played has shown me a good foundation for a completed game well worth the current $30 price tag. But it needs to be stressed it is still an early access game, still apparently very early in it's release content cycle. If you're okay with that risk, getting it at full price would probably be worthwhile, but otherwise wait for a sale or until larger content is released. 

To elaborate slightly, a lot of the features are implemented by not balanced, or not very in depth yet. There is a fairly large tech tree already, but it's a fairly straight forward fish bone, and the progression can seem odd at times. You can unlock the ability to let the AI place buildings and staff them, but the placement is... haphazard at times and outright bad at others. Smaller villages form separate from your main settlement, with relationship meters, but with only one way I could find to actually influence it, and even that is a random event. Alerts will pop up but not all of them will take you to the event they're telling you about. Other will pop up but you have to click a specific word (usually a name) in the popup to get to to show you the event.

But I get it, the importance right now is to implement as many features of possible to test them out and make sure they're working rather than balance them (for now). And keeping that in mind, the game ran really smoothly, with no obvious bugs or issues. It looked good, it played good, and I'm frankly looking forward to see where it goes.",1558612407,1558612407,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The Universim is The God game we been waiting for?

     The universim is a god sim where you the Creator makes your civilization from just two cute little nuggets to a whole city!

Game play overview- The Game play in the what you would expect from a game like this pros being.
-cool god powers that you can use such as setting things on fire, throwing down a lightning bolt, the ability to heal your nuggets 
and much more 
-city planing (if you don't put the right building down at the right time things could go very wrong)
-Exile villages with a relationship with your city
-Researching better improvements to your civilization 
-mini quest
-most the time the narrator has some funny quip
-and a whole bunch of other little game play features such as human resources 

Now here is where we come to the cons of the game play
-it is so fucking slow in the start of the game 
-research times are way to long some being 20 irl minutes that you have to wait before getting 
-since it is early access the game does not have a lot of things to do and could get very boring very fast
-some small bugs here and there nothing game breaking
-every time there is an update to the game you have to restart and I believe you cant go back to your old saves. 

The graphics of the game are very Cartoony and I think it does well for this game not much to go into there. 

The music and sound of the Game is very well done completely peaceful as your cooking some nuggets

Over all the game is a solid 7/10 and has a lot of good replay ability and stuff to do. There are a lot of things that I hope that dev would add in the game one of the things i'm looking forward to is when aliens get introduce to the game.

Still some small things to work out but it is early access so no complaints. Although its only the alpha and a small part of the game, I've still enjoyed playing, and I feel its still very good for an alpha version. Building times and resources feel realistic, and once you unlock free will for the nuggets, expansion becomes much easier. 

So far, the only real issues I have had is with the building models. I did enjoy the fact that once Tudor age is unlocked, the buildings have to be updated in real time, and don't just automatically update which makes it feel like a more authentic advancement.
 However, one of the things that bothered me slightly, was that there is quite a jump in aesthetics from Stone age to Tudor. You have some buildings that update into pre-modern housing, while some buildings are stuck in a very primitive style. One way around this jump I feel, would be an era between stone and Tudor, possibly a middle age or a iron age. This would see buildings update from piles of rocks to maybe straw topped structures, reducing the jump between stone and Tudor looks. 

A part from that though, I have enjoyed the game so far and am looking forward to other age's/the full game becoming unlocked.",1553358910,1553358910,True,2,0,0.53271031379699707,0,True,False,True

You literally have to control almost everything, not just godly powers that you can randomly use to sculpt the world or help your nuggets (The citizens in the game.) You control what they research, and exactly where and how many of the ""utility buildings"" (meaning any building that isn't a basic dwelling) there are. You also have to specifically select which nuggets will perform which tasks, but hey they choose their own laws. Except they don't, you get to choose how they vote too.

The only thing you have the option to leave your nuggets to your own devices to do is breed and build basic dwellings.

When I got this game I was kind of hoping for a game where you watched multiple empires spring up, and basically just got to do whatever you wanted to/with them. Want to control them like you do now? Sure, want to watch at a distance and occasionally be a dick? Why not.

The game progression is pretty slow so you can spend hours in the medieval age, which I love. It gives buildings purpose rather than being constantly replaced and upgraded.

The narrator is funny and charming but disappears after a few hours as you get past the first phase, I would love for extra dialogue to be added later on from him. 

The graphics are fine and charming, there is a lot going on behind the scenes in this game so I would rather have a game that works well than looks good. They are not blockbuster graphics but are perfectly fine in my opinion.

My advice is if you think the game looks fun it it's current state and are happy putting up with some bugs here and there buy it. If you think the end product looks great but not don't like the idea of playing an unfinished game(not gonna lie it's a long way off the end goal) then maybe hold off getting it now.

It would not be fair to give it a thumbs down at all, because it is a fun, cute little time waster of a game. But, there really isn't that much justification for a thumbs up either... 

My first encounter with the developers of this game was not really pleasant either- that was years ago, when i first paid for the game. The method to download and test the game pre alpha was highly flawed and regardless of my emails to the developer about a locked account that i couldn't not access, went unanswered until i finally gave up, at that point i forgot all about this game- until i saw it on steam this past year. I avoided it because i still had beef with the developers, but eventually repaid for the game on steam and started playing. 

I don't understand somethings about this game- like how something as small as a well can take up such a large portion or real estate.. or how faith seems so imbalanced.

The reality is- it is still a fun game, although flawed it some regards.

I really like the idea and the base that are in is good. Since it’s still in alpha much can change but I like where it seems to be heading now. 

Starts out much like early settlers’ game where you do much of the building and during late game it’s more what black and white was supposed to be (yup I’m old). The AI have a bit to go but the nuggets do solve most problems and already make their own decisions to sort micromanagement boring things like collecting food, repair etc. Sure, they could be smarter but still they are poor innocent nuggets so you can’t expect too much.

Overall a good game that have come far. The transition between ages are the only thing that annoy me. Even that you have a good supply of oil, steel and had mastered electricity you are still stuck in stone age. A smoother transition between ages, where research only is for unlocking slots and buildings would make the game feel more alive.

But my god complex has never been quite so satisfied as in creative mode. Addictive as it is easy to learn. I am genuinely excited to see what more the dev’s can do with this title. Currently I would give this game a solid 7.5/10 with the potential of becoming a must have classic. 

Constructive feedback:
1. God powers are an awesome feature, truly awesome. But the systems a tad unbalanced, its super hard keeping your Richard Dawkins Jr, atheist Nuggets giving juicy god points, without having to spend all of said points, coupling off random blue Nugget A with Random Pink Nugget B. Maybe a buildable temple or indoctrination process would be an easy fix to a un-necessary annoyance. (I do like the cupido power, I just don’t want to have to pull it out for literally every single nugget of every generation in perpetuity) 
2. Must mention god powers again but this time more! Earthquakes, tsunami, plagues. Parting the sea. Heavenly boons and smiteful smites. Gifts of Nugget strength, perception and intelligence to the devoted citizens. Turn a non believer into a pile of goo or a turkey just because you can? Maybe take reference to the Greco and roman gods and their gifts and punishments for inspiration? 
3. Militarization of the creators flock is a must see in upcoming pre release patches. a stronghold 2 style choice of *rehabilitation* for the criminal nuggets. And as for the exile pudu, they will join us or die....... I could envisage a strong axe and a weak nugget neck making quite the show in front of a temple dedicated mob. I also think we, as god, might need the ability to form a group of nugget elite to show those exiles whose stick is pointier from time to time. The player definitely needs some influence to attack / defend from exile tribes. 
4. Love what your doing with the tech system, looks super promising! 
5. The level of buildings is already good, but I am excited to see what else is lying behind all those pesky ""coming soon"" tech trees.
6. The upper scale building materials, refined wood and stone etc need to be rebuilt to work. As soon as a civilization gets to needing these resources then all the nuggets take a sigh of ****ahhhhhhh***** as they collectively agree not to build anything anymore. Even when you have the necessary items in some remote stone mine in the mountains nobody goes to collect it. Nobody refills the wood or stone refinery buildings except the player, mindlessly scanning and looking for grabable rocks to sink into the endless tireless forge only for it to go idle whilst little nugget labourer Billy goes off to look at the ground for say……. 4 years game time.  Even when you have 20+ idle labourers progress is needlessly slow.  

7. Nugget arena would be cool. Could provide entertainment and allow some nugget elite to become worthy of championing their god and get special perks in the process? Or die….. May the odds forever be in their favour 

8. The modern age and beyond sound so promising. I am quietly sceptical that it can realistically live up to the promises made however without damaging performance. Especially the multi world goal. I have faith however as the devs have far from let me down so far.

- Some challenging but fun dilemmas to face
- amazing development team making constant additions which keep me hooked and interested

- So many other great things

A few cons:
- Often difficult to place buildings in any kind of organized fashion
- Zooming in and out is not optimal
- A lot of missing features
- Not a great balance between being an evil or good God, I see no real benefit to sacrificing people or punishing mu nuggets

As far as sims go, there's not a whole lot to do so far, but that's par for the course with an early access game. The devs seem very active with their updates, so I doubt it'll wind up incomplete. The Universim is easy to get a hang of, satisfying to binge, and overall a really relaxing play. The graphics are amazing, with popping colours and clean environment/character designs, and the music soothes my sooooul. The gameplay is standard, but the addition of ""God Powers"" lets you get hands-on with your planet and its people. All in all, a really shining example of a solid world simulator.

I do find that it can get a little bit stressful at times when bugs pop up and disable your powers or delete your ALL save data (that one's definitely no good, guys), but most of them are tiny and easily fixed by a quick restart. Besides, once you've gotten a good handle on the game, it's easy to rocket back to where you were before.

All in all, a really promising start that's got me totally hooked. Not quite enough content so far (getting one civilization up to perfect standards takes about seven or eight hours), but what we have so far is absolutely perfect, and the replayability is fine.

First impressions are pretty great.
This is basically an updated version of Black & White, with a little sprinkle of Civilization and Banished.

Nice soundtrack, graphics are nice to look at, great weather effects, day/night cycles and seasons are pretty cool.  I love how the planet is actually rotating around the sun, causing it all to happen.
Your little villagers do a lot of stuff on thier own, chopping down trees and mining and building thier own little houses, which is really nice.
The game does a decent job of explaining the mechanics of doing things, building hospitals and farms and whatnot, though there is a slight learning curve to some things, and you might need to still consult a wiki/guide here and there.
But, if you're used to colony building games, you'll figure it out after a bit.
Also this game takes a bit of patience.   Things aren't done immediatley, so you need to pace yourself when building things, or suddenly everyone starves to death because they're building an outpost instead of the restaurant you wanted.

Good stuff overall, though i've encountered a few crashes once the population gets over 100+, and the game seems to start freezing up here and there randomly. 
But.. over all, it feels like a great start, and it really feels like the devs are putting some love into this game.
Well worth the $25-30 so far.
Looking forward to actually heading into space later  :D

-Оптимизация ресурсов и их данные,
-Русссификация (не самое важное),
-Наладка Нагетсов, чтобы они не умирали по пути к Таверне где им надо поесть,
-Больше статистики по данным,
-Наглядное видиние приоритетов (возможно отдельный столбец)
-Усовершенстование охотников, чтобы охотились и на лис и на волков.
-Чтобы нагеты занимали свободные квартиры и дома, если те пустуют.
-САМОЕ ГЛАВНОЕ, свыше 250 нагетов, они начинают сильно тупить, и очень сложно что либо с этим сделать.

Good day to everyone, this game reminds of Knights and Merchants, but unfortunately many of them are not enough, of course it is clear that this is a pre version, but such dorobotki as:
-Optimization of resources and their data,
- Russification (not the most important),
-Nalads adjustment so that they do not die on the way to the Tavern where they need to eat,
-More statistics on the data
-Guest vision of priorities (perhaps a separate column)
- Improvement of hunters to hunt both foxes and wolves.
-To nagets occupied free apartments and houses, if they are empty.
- MOST IMPORTANT, over 250 nuggets, they start to get very stupid, and it is very difficult to do something about it.
-Etc.
It is NOT ADVISED to buy it now, for the present it is too little and boring, but it takes notable time, especially the tree of learning skills, as in civilization, but from Real Time.

I could maybe recommend it if it wasn't £20 and less than half of that, honestly, but for the game as is, I would wait until it's improved upon or find something else to play.

This game intrigued me because it seemed like a mix between Spore, a game I adored, and Black & White. So as soon as I heard about it, I had to give it a go. And in premise, it's a really good idea, and I really want to like it and definitely plan to mess around with it some more. But there's a few glaring issues that dampen the experience for me.

Firstly, the absolute biggest problem with this game is that the fastest speed up option is x1.5. With this style of game, a good speed-up option is mandatory, and for comparison most Maxis games max out at x4. This meant I was often idly checking my phone or web browsing just waiting for things to actually happen, and that's pretty unacceptable in a £20 game. That's the kind of thing I expect in a free to play casual idle game, honestly. The solution to this is obviously just to have a faster speed-up option, or an alternative route to go to is to get rid of the research timers, which brings me to my next point.

I don't fundamentally have an issue with research taking time. It makes sense. But given you can only speed the game up 1.5x speed, you're sometimes waiting up to 15 minutes to unlock your next objective. Again, hitting the point I said about it being like a free to play idle game. The timer system should either be scrapped entirely and replaced with a point or money system, as that feels much more player-rewarding than waiting around. In fact, there's points already for God powers, so it could just chip into that. If you want the best of both worlds, lower the timers significantly and add a points costs. It's just not fair on players to spend £20 on a game, only then to wait around for several minutes for things to actually happen in said game.

Most of the research trees don't make any sense or otherwise need to be expanded upon. They read like they've been written by someoone with little knowledge of history. Why do you [b][i]have[/i][/b] to get electricity before Tudor housing? I know the devs are from California and I don't know how much they know of British history, but electricity was discovered 400 years after the start of the Tudor era, and that's ignoring the jump from stone huts to tudor houses, and how this also means you can have electricity whilst [i]still living in stone huts[/i]. I'm hoping the devs rearrange this and add research objectives between those two periods. Technology seems to advance all at once after a fairly reasonable start, and maybe I'm being nitpicky about a video game not being accurate, but when you're portraying the rise of a civilisation, there needs to be some sort of logic and consistency to how that civilisation would rise to be what it is today.

Last problem is there's several grammatical errors and spelling mistakes, such as ""answearing"" the Tesla prayer, though this is fairly minor and an easy fix.

I'll end this on a positive note, the good. The narration is witty and funny and just all around enjoyable. The concept is fun and has a lot of potential, and I'm excited to see where the devs take this assuming they take on advice.",1548240400,1548241315,False,51,2,0.65728294849395752,7,True,False,True

Cons: The controls are garbage. They are cluncky, confusing and very finacy. Add to that a sarcastic asshole of a narrateor and a good chunk of the time the game is unplayable. Considering that nothing about this game is even remotely original they should have just swiped the controls from a game that already did it right (Dungeonkeeper, or War for the Overworld).

Cons: There is no customization. Even though there are literally dozens of research options and skill to choose the game give you no customization options. On the rare ocasions where you need to choose one of three options no matter which branch you choose they all lead to the same place. And in the cases where you cn pick and choose skills the game will automaticlly pick the ones you left out. Ex. sy you wnt to creat a race of peaceful farmes who would never hunt or fish, you can't. The moment you stop selecting research the game will automatically pick them for you. So if you choose to have your nuggets not learn to hunt, the game will just go ahead and pick hunting for you the moment you back is turned.

Cons: Despite being a GOD you cn't tell the little bastards what to do. They will not build a damned thing no matter what you stell them. I had a well that was under construction for 238 years.

Cons: There is a very real feeling that nothing you do matters. You fix a few billion structures and you beg the little pukes to ""please for the freaking love of god build something"" but that's kind of it. With the game picking its own research and nuggets building only what they feel like building it's almost like your only job is deciding where to put the building the nuggets won't build.

Cons: Night time makes the game unplayable too.

The website is very well done, as is the Steam page. The graphic designing and set up are definitely a testament to the kind of focus and effort put into the game. The price is steep, for sure. I think that in order to get a decent base of players, it would help to have the price a bit lower. BUT you are getting a great game for the money. All in all, buy this game.

Overall the impression on the game is positive, given its current Alpha status. It is a strong game with a well-formed idea behind it. Don't expect a finished product, though, there will be bugs cropping up pretty much everywhere. Luckily though, they are not game-breaking.

Right now I am pretty advanced with my civilization, having discovered electricity with a population of 174-strong. 

The good:
* You are a god!
* The graphics are very nice. The game looks awesome.
* The town, as it develops, gains that extraordinary organic look, certainly made me feel like it grew naturally, which is awesome as far as I am concerned. I love the fact that I don't have to lay down every street and path, focusing instead on stuff that matters.
* Research tree is well designed, except from all the ""coming soon"" entries which frankly shouldn't have been there.
* Music is nice and doesn't get in the way, nor does it feel repetitive, 
* The game keeps you occupied for the most time, with the occasional lulls which allow you to explore the beauty of the planet.
* The narrator voice is awesome. it is indeed one of the game's best features.
* The informative texts about in-game events are witty, ironic, sarcastic and funny at the same time but not at all over-the-top. Excellent!

The bad:
* Plenty of small bugs: missing texts, repetitive messages and the like.
* The game doesn't do a good job explaining what needs to be done or providing you with clear information, leading to some issues that could have been avoided. For example, a short while into the game I was informed that buildings all over the town are on the brink of collapse. Yes, I had an Engineers hut. The game sure takes its time to tell you, and when you finally realize you're short of Engineers, it's going to be a race against time to get things back to their feet, so pay attention to things like that. I had to learn the hard way.
* There are some small inconsistencies such as the ""Jolt of Joy"" power requiring 10 creator points in the tooltip but taking 20 in reality, unless you have under 20 points available, in which case it takes 10 points only. Weird...

Overall the game is recommended, because it brings much enjoyment, and is complex enough to keep you occupied for hours and hours. I can't say much about repeatability, I'll have to replay it a few times before I could give my opinion in that regard.

I simply have to give up right now, otherwise I will keep losing people due to people just leaving the job for no reason, getting hurt and walking to the FARTHEST hospital there is. 

Electricity right now is a pain, I dont know why were not devoloping it. OH its because all the workers are hurt and in the hospital. Oh wait, over half of my damn population of (basically over 100 people) are either so injured they cant work or they die ON THE WAY TO THE FARTHEST HOSPITAL.

I played this game for 8 hours straight when I bought it yesterday. Ive done all the research possible at this point and im only around 180 people or so. But the amount of hospitals that I need, the electricity that just isn't being made for some reason and the food shortage from people just leaving the job without notice for me or anything is absurd and I can't keep playing, otherwise everything I have done will most likely just die. The AI and Automation needs some SERIOUS overhaul. You cannot expect me to handle over 50+ building at once, at only 180 people just to make sure no one left the job for no reason or nothing is being devoloped for no reaon. We have the resources. We have the people. There are animals legit OUTSIDE the hunting house. Why are you not going for it? Minor annoyances keep adding up and I have to put this game down until a later patch.

I will come back to the FIXYOURAI save once, well you get the idea.

-Edit- 1/7/19

I have come back to this game to change my postive review to a negative. Simply because I failed to see the blatant false advertising in this game.

All of those rockets, and aliens and skyscrapers are NOT in the game. It is planned, but the trailer suggests that this is achievable in the current stage in the game. IT IS NOT.

Right now, the farthest you can get is just a basic tavern. Science study is not complete, as in game suggests ""Coming soon"" all over the research tree. What you see in the trailer is not accessable in the game yet and it is blatant false advertising. I failed to realize that until I came back to see when the last update was made. Then I started reading comments, and realized it myself.

The game is FANTASTIC, I love the hell out of it. But do not show over 80% of your trailer with items and progression that is not even unlockable yet. Other planets are there, as I have accidently clicked at a random spot in space and an ""Ice planet"" info box came up. Its there. It is simply not accessable yet as the trailer and advertising suggests. Do not buy this until a longer stage in the alpha is complete. I will keep it installed and updated.",1545957545,1546841765,False,1,0,0.512276053428649902,0,True,False,True
352720,44677351,76561198252144478,0,6,2619,0,1442,1644053963,"I really wish I could give this game a thumbs up on recommendation because, honestly... I enjoyed it again even if now a bit tedious and boring. I know it's early access and in progress, but it feels uncomfortably unfinished, even with what is currently available in the game. Thus, the current price is too steep. Let me go into more detail of my current concerns so that I am helpful to you, the developers, as I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want to see this game one day be successful. 

1. Although the resource difficulty with trees has been resolved and allows the game to be completely playable in regards to resources, I came across multiple glitches, one of which involving food that ultimately destroyed my gameplay (shortly prior to it crashing and becoming unloadable). I had a population of 180 entering the second (and currently final) stage and rapidly had a population boom that lept to over 260 and I was unable to keep up... At one point I had 40 children. The boom meant I didn't have enough food. The mapping system, I noticed, causes all hungry individuals to chase towards the food/resource/shelter, but don't stop until they get there, meaning they often run from place to place to place across the map and never are productive - leading into a death spiral. Being able to cure some of them or provide them with food or something would be great. Either that or a change in map traveling processes.

2. I think largely due to needing to get resources from long distances, but possibly also just as intended design, the nuggets eventually don't produce enough to even sustain themselves, let alone grow... and that includes with assistance from me, supposed creator of the universe.

3. Still a user preference, but I would still love to see a way to track family bloodlines and/or the successors at the tower.  

4. Glitches: Although some of the glitches have been resolved, there are now new glitches that I found even more detrimental to gameplay. 1: Despite having a decent gaming computer, the game began to lag significantly shortly before hitting 100 nuggets. 2: Within the first 3 hours of gameplay, had crashed twice. 3. A glitch that came along with the mapping issue that ended my gameplay ultimately - The nuggets continue to age (my oldest when I realized that it was likely a glitch was 146), stop producing baby nuggets, and stop giving creator points despite being incredibly happy, nonexistant crime rate, and high output according to the Temple. Realizing a glitch had occurred, I saved my game and exited as I had with one of the first glitches. The game would not reload after that point so the glitch(es?) rendered the game unplayable.

5. Price. That's right. $$. This straight up is not a $30 game at the moment, still. With the content that is CURRENTLY available, the price is ridiculous. Considering that I've now played through the content again, I feel like I should be much more impressed especially since I was excited based on what was supposedly being added and what was added. However, I didn't get to play with the prison system after researching it due to the glitches and unexpected population boom. Furthermore, it didn't appear that it would have added hours of gameplay. As it was, most of my game was spent bored and waiting on research now that the newness of the graphics (aka beauty) of the game has worn off. There just wasn't enough to do to make the game worth the money. I agree with my initial statement of the game only being worth 10-12 hours of gameplay and thus $10-12 based on my personal preference and expectation. Generally speaking, I value a game as ""worth the money"" if I'm willing to sit there and play for $1 = 1 hour of gameplay in the state its in (much of the reason I've gotten out of certain ""big name"" games). Again, I THINK and HOPE it will end up being worth that and maybe much more as it is an EA game... but that's not a promise. Since getting the game, I am not impressed by the updates that have come out, which makes me nervous for the future of this game as yes, there is progress, but that progress is too incredibly slow.

6. The controls are still a bit wonky to get used to, but much better and faster as long as you can use the mouse. When holding something, though, it's still very slow to get around the planet.

7. Lastly, a more in-depth tutorial in the beginning would still be super helpful, specifically in regards to controls and quests which should explain how to do/find things (such as the lost child quest which 2/3 times I failed because I couldn't find the kid anywhere). Failed this again because following the wolf howls is near impossible, on top of knowing how to safely set the kid down without killing it.

This game is PHENOMENAL. The hours that I have put into this godsim thus far have kept me entranced. I will play through the content that is available, save, then start an entirely new civilization with different choices and continue to enjoy it. From the quirky statements to watching your civilization grow I have had hours of fun. Absolutely worth every penny!

Currently in Universim you start in the stone age, and as you research and your civilzation grows you move towards electricity and a midieval era. However, this is where we stop for now. I know more updates are coming and I'm very excited for them--but this is the only thing I see as a downside. I want MORE. I want more content more frequently. I want to be able to play through to a space era and see what is instore for me.. but that is not available yet. 

If you like city builders or godsim games this is defintely the game for you. Just be mindful you'll have to come back and check for updates over time.

being that it's also extremely extremely difficult, the negatives first 

1) It is difficult to gain believers even though I am literally throwing people into space.  If i saw my girl fly out of my house and into space after i just finished making babies, I'm pretty sure I'd believe in a higher power just saying.

2) GLITCHY BUGS ARE A DRAG! looks great but u click on something u might has well click 100 times because it might not work. 

3) I had a lone bear walking through the village murdering at will until he froze there. or there was a mission i had to save a child from a wolf attack lol and nothing i did could save him lol he was eating alive as i sat there as the creator and wondered why i couldn't help. 

Overall, awesome game, decent playablity even right now, but obviously unfinished. Buy if you are willing to support the finishing of the game, but don't underestimate the Alpha warning it's literally watermarked on the top right corner! i bought it on sale for 8.99 would have been very disappointed if i paid $30 lol. 

ooh the tutorial is non existant you are god have fun lol you better build those wells and what's up with the stone mines i can't build them unless im close out and reopen game! 

and ooh another thing i have CRAZY Framerate drops when i click on lets say ""stone house"" and it zooms in to it from accross the map like dude i have a 1080 gpu why is this happening lol then i look at the watermarked ALPHA GAME in the top right and give mad respect great game highly recommend! if you didn't play it more then 5 hours you aren't worthy of a review.",1546761884,1546761884,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

Idk if the devs read these posts (I hope they do), but overall it is a great game. I've had a blast playing it over break. Obviously since it is in alpha you can't expect it to be perfect. However, I do think that they could easily give the game a couple quality of life fixes to make gameplay more intuitive, and less you having to run around checking things you don't really want to be doing.

First QOL update could be to update the buildings menu so that you can upgrade your current buildings from the menu instead of having to travel to each individual building and upgrade it at the site. Every time I unlock a new upgrade in the tree I dread having to go all around my civilization to upgrade the structures.

Second QOL update would to maybe introduce an available employment tab, so that you could easily see all the buildings that need workers and you could quickly assign them without having to once again, travel to every building that has employment available and go through the sub menus on the individual buildings just like with upgrading. Maybe this could be added in addition to upgrade options under the structres tab.

Final QOL update would to make the information windows bigger, I feel like I have to scroll and click through a million structures tab to find the one that I'm looking for, I'd rather just see more rows and a little more information on each one. Same goes for the nuggets menu.

Maybe this could all be solved by having the structures tab be a fullscreen overlay with additional information such as availible employment slots, available upgrades, etc. instead of just a small window to allow for the extra functionality.

Streamlining some of the more repetative tasks like upgrading and assigning nuggets to work would be very helpful and make the game feel better. I definitly plan on finishing through the current upgrade tree then coming back to the game after it's recieved more updates. Lots of fun.",1546595920,1546595920,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

I will say it feels like those games but it stands on its on as a god game from the way nuggets act to the way your god powers work, The idea of going from the stone age to space age is pretty epic to!

As for the nuggets and god powers you control the nuggets directly but you can pick them up and do really awesome things like toss them around and sacrifice them lol you can also make nuggets fall in love i thought was a neat idea. Other god powers are you can make distarers happen for example fires, twisters, and thunderstorms. The tech tree is pretty straightforward you do have to keep pushing it forward and sometimes come back to older branches to unlike more upgrades. (the game only goes to the medieval age right now)

Some of the things im not a fan of is the nuggets building in odd spots like on the other side of lakes and they have to walk for ever to get to where they need to be and will mostly likely just die on the trip. Some other little things here and there but the game is still in alpha so not going to get into it.

UPDATE: 27 December 2018

Recently the devs reached out to me in response to my previous review of the Universim, so I thought it only fair to give it another playthrough and evaluate the new changes.  I do thank them for addressing my criticisms, this is exactly what a dev should do and the best way to strike up rapport with your community and improve your product.

I have sunk an additional 4.2 hours into the game which involved two tedious restarts due to bugs failing to trigger certain events.  All in all, the experience was frankly like watching paint dry.  My primary criticism of this game remains: the waiting.

The devs have done well with this game, and it truly is beautiful, but it's just boring.

I know what you're thinking - This guy is just impossible to please!  But hear me out, the kind of incessant micromanagement was not the kind of ""stuff to do"" you want to pass your time.  I build a few buildings, employ a few nuggets, and it's self-managing.  Quests pop up from time to time (sometimes a VERY long time), but otherwise you just sit there and wait for research to unlock and progress your society.

Crytivo have made excellent in-roads with the new happiness engine resolving a previous issue, which was nugget depression and the onslaught of suicidal citizens who require constant intervention from you with your God powers.  This no longer seems to be an issue, although there are a few idiots in my society who continue to insist on drinking dirty lake water despite a reservoir and well having clean water inside it.  Natural selection?

The present price-point of The Universim at $42.95 AUD / $29.99 USD / £22.99 is just obscene for something that functions no better than as a screensaver.  Sure, the game might just not be to my taste, but this price point, at this level of functionality, makes it irresponsible for me to give the game a thumbs up and recommend it to other gamers.  Crytivo, I understand your game is early access, and your game IS worthy of a thumbs up, you have done an excellent job thus far - but you are asking way too much money for a product which is only fractionally complete.  It isn't right.

In an era where triple-A title developers make a habit of releasing half finished games to market in an effort to satisfy shareholders to steal your hard earned sheckles, then asking people to pay additional money for a season pass or DLC to access content that should have been included in the original completed product, Crytivo certainly doesn't appear to be doing anything to buck this trend.  It is no more acceptable for smaller devs to ask such significant prices for ""Early Access"" ventures while making the wider community their free play testers.  There is nothing wrong with doing this, but the price should reflect same, and currently, and it does not.

The Universim is another title which talks a big talk and promises the universe but fails to walk the walk.
----

As at 3 September 2018, the game looks very nice, but requires a lot of tweaking and balancing.  At present, it might work better as a screen saver as much of your time is spent watching and waiting for advancements to be done (but would require significant enhancements to AI in order for this to be viable).  The game requires more micromanagement in order to give the  player anything to really do other than stare at the goings on and wait for techs to be researched or enough God power to accumulate to fix problems.

Game graphics look absolutely delightful, music is immersive although could use some more upbeat scores being added to the selection to draw in the player.  Sound effects polish the cartoonish feel to this simulator, but is unfortunately, another game releasing after years of ""development"" at a price which can only be described as rude for early access.  When it is ""finished"", I can certainly see this being worth $30, but not in it's current state.

Note that at present, the tech tree is linear and not randomised as seen in some YouTube videos.

It is early access, so there are still a few bugs.  These are not intended to be nit picking or exhaustive, but just to catalogue some of those I have encountered:
- I did encounter an instance where cycling into spring did not alter temperatures nor unfreeze lakes and my world was permanently stuck in an ice age despite apparently higher predicted temperatures.
- Right clicking will always reset the cursor dead centre of the screen after momentarily disappearing the cursor.
- Occasional bug in some God-driven missions, i.e. clear infection is not always possible to perform.

Depression of nuggets (citizens) moods requires tweaking as nothing short of building a hair salon (yes, really) can provide them with enough of a boost to their mood to bring them out of depression / being suicidal in order to encourage them to perform work.  This is problematic as the hair salon requires a tech to be developed which requires over one hour of solid gameplay to unlock.  A small famine or people dying from lake contamination can lead to a vicious cycle whereby grave diggers are too depressed to collect bodies, other nuggets then walk past the bodies who become depressed and then do no work either, consequently the economy grinds to a halt.

Such a situation requires you to expend God power to manually move bodies to the cemetary, as well as heal subjects AND boost their mood, all using your god powers - it becomes a game of finding the most vulnerable (close to dying) nugget to heal as soon as  you have enough God power, and then to prioritise mood boosts using your God power when you have enough.

The early game is well polished and the narrator is (mostly) helpful. As the game continues, more and more things are introduced that you need to expand your civilization: more food, more water, crime, more nuggets, and more. Requiring management of these sorts of resources is fine at the point they are introduced, however the game quickly scales beyond the UI's capability to do so.

For example, one of the recurring problems that I had once my population reached around 400 nuggets was mating: the only way to force nuggets to pair is with the god power that does so. However, the nuggets will stack on top of each other, making it extremely difficult to actually click on nuggets that are not already in a relationship so that you can pair them with another nugget. The game does not provide any other interface for this interaction, and this pattern continues for the other resources that are introduced earlier in the game.

I really hope to see the mid and end-game automation get a solution here, but even with these problems this game is enjoyable for the first several hours. As long as you mute the narrator.",1546128105,1546128105,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, after you progress just beyond the absolute basics it is quite clear how remarkably shallow the current product is. I progressed all the way to the verge of the medieval age in about 3 1/2 hours, and in that time, the last hour or so was so repetitive and non challenging I decided to quit.

There are so many UI and management problems that are going to drive gamers crazy. For example, there is no way to see idle buildings. There is no way to view which buildings of yours need an upgrade. There is no way to select all of one type of a building. This results in a great deal of micro-management with no easy way to do it. If you have 10 wells scattered thoughout your city, good luck making sure all of them get upgraded.

I see a great deal of promise if they developers are actually able to finish the game and make the mid to late game as entertaining as the beginning.

Nuggets will constantly drink out of a lake when there is a well right beside them, constantly making them sick.

One of my worlds, the nuggets decided to build new houses on the other side of a lake - a trek which took them 3 in-game days to accomplish. They would literally starve to death on the way there, and there is no option to stop them from moving there.

That said, its going to be good. Maybe very good. There is a great template so far for building your civilization, and I can see good things to come with the tech tree. However, I'll focus on what is negative since the game needs to move forward from here.

1) It is difficult to gain believers even though I am literally popping trees up in front of them (among other powers). At one point, I found an infidel, picked her up, twirled her around, and set her back down. If that happened to me, I'm pretty sure I'd believe in a higher power. 

2) I wish I could train my people to defend themselves better. I literally lost 30 people to a wolf attack after I had built defense towers and had the warning bell ringing. I also had the right to bear arms at the time. They should have been able to fight.

3) There are plenty of glitches. I had several homesteads locked in perpetual coitus even though there was no-one home. One time after a wolf attack, I had a lone wolf walking through the village murdering at will until he floated off across the lake.

Overall idea of the game

Dislikes:
- Tough to find a building (if you need to find an Engineer's hut for example, you need to open the full menu then scroll through menus to find it alphabetically (overlays would help with this; water related, crime overlays, food overlays etc, even biome overlays would help)

Suggestions:
- Keep the full tree hidden until specific times or enough previous ones are unlocked.
- Have Nugget's get auto assigned to a job if it's open, like when a building completes. Prioritized by education (though I have no idea what benefit Educating your Nuggets even gives you, besides a slight lowering of Crime)
- Have some sort of display that shows you how many days you can survive without water or food production with the current amount you have stored/cooked (so you can estimate if you'll have enough for winter/a disaster. It's really (to me) estimating at this point)
- Income menu (hourly/whatever income for food/herbs/lumber/stone etc)
- Have a ""residential"" area for Nuggets you can expand as they multiply. Now their building of homes seems random and it strikes me as something you should be able to define.
- If you meet other civilizations and you are a young enough species, I think they should automatically be hostile.",1545621789,1545621789,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

That is the weakness of the game that I hope the developers will work on.  The tutorial tips are not very clear, and some things are not properly emphasized as to their importance.  And once you fall behind, it's extremely difficult to catch back up.  Also, it took a bit of practice to use the god-level powers, as it wasn't really described well.  Not to mention that the interface is a little clunky.  It's pretty, but not very easy to use.

All of these I think make it difficult for new players to get into it without a lot of frustration.

Still, I do like the general smoothness, the art and sound.  The game has a future, if the developers don't give up on it.",1545560159,1545560159,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I bought the game and I loved it, I enjoyed the mechanics and it is really intuitive, the quests are simple and don’t feel overwhelming, the nuggets build their own houses and you don’t have to worry too much with micromanagement. Your powers feel good to use in most cases. In the other hand after a while you feel like there is not much too do but to stare at your town, at the same time I don’t know if this issue is my doing or not but I feel like the nuggets struggle with collecting resources like water and wood, then again I’m still in my first play though so take it with a grain of salt. Also the CP (creator power) of creating trees i think it doesn’t cover enough of an area and is annoying to use.
I love the idea of exile villages but I don’t like the idea that there isn’t an option to raise an army yet, I know you can create fortifications but idk if you have an army (anyone correct me if I’m wrong) and lastly then again idk if this issue if mine or not but after a while the population starts to stall, I peaked at 110-120 population but now stands at like 84 and going down. Then again idk if this issue is my doing or not.
And finally my last thought is that I would loved to see a coop mode where you can play with a friend as co creators and/or create parallels towns that believe in the opposite creator, it might be a good i idea, Idk if other people would find it attractive or not.
I loved the game with it flaws and see the potential of a full game and i see forward to what the developing team brings to the game next.

Pro;

- Early Access as it should be 
- Relaxed Gameplay with great ""Wusel-Factor""
- Building and manage ressources with a season system
- U are something like god with Believer-System and Skills like Healing, Seeding Woods or 
    lightning Bolt or let it Rain and  more!
- I like the Graphics and the Artstyle
- During Game Progression micromanagement grows
- Great Tech-Tree (working in Progress)
- I played over 50 hours and the game Crashed 1 Time
- New Content every Month (3 times still steam Release i think)
- Happiness System, Neighour Factions, Criminal System, Beliiver System
- Nice Ui and good information about Building, Nuggets and so on
- Its planned so start with researching things like fire and clothes and at one later time on the 
  Game you leave your planet and start exploring outer space
- Great Sense of Humor

Contra:
- Some may dont like that your Nuggets build theirs houses automaticly.
- Working progress actually ends in medieval
- no Pet to control

In a normal game mode, the game starts at a fast pace, with research to unlock new buildings fast, after a hour or so, the game grinds to a hold when research and the frequent loss of people in the game make it hard to prevent disasters, wolf attacks and keep a sustainable population despite your best efforts. 

Without religion points you will find the game hard to play and recovering from, or preventing attacks is hard, even if you have a bank of points the game will send waves of attach once your population gets to 50 or so, destroying your ability to move the game forward. 

Even if you get past all of this, the game speed will still drop off, requiring more resources to be used for upgrades and refining into other materials.  If you have the engineering building requiring a upgrade and you do not do this but still have a large population, your buildings will start falling down, almost as if you didn’t even have a engineer to repair your building.

The images of roads, rockets and the future of the game looks amazing, at this time the game needs the following improvements.

•	Stop multiple disaster waves of wolf attacks without time to recover. 
•	Make a game option of easy or hard
•	Make the fast forward option in the game from x 1.2 or x 1.5 to 2 or 3 times faster.
•	Have less population crashes
•	When population has babies, have even boys and girls to help keep population alive
•	Add commentary to creative mode for wolf attacks alerts, etc. 
•	In normal game mode have the option to place homes to design the city layout

I hope this game becomes as amazing and as interesting as the images look, but at this time its not fun to spend three or four hours with the game, just to have the population crash through disasters waves an no chance or recovering your city.",1544149723,1544149723,False,0,1,0.472440958023071289,5,True,False,True

 That being said, this game sat on my wishlist for a YEAR while they worked on it and got ready for Alpha launch. When I got the notification that I could buy this I cheered outloud, getting lots of funny looks from my coworkers, and all of my friends had no idea what I was talking about. 

 This was worth the wait. Bearing in mind that this game is still being worked on, I love it. It keeps me busy, its bright, its colorful. I love the sass that comes from the narator guy.  I love the sound effects and the music, and for whatever reason I think calling the people nuggets is adorable. The base game itself is totally solid and has all the makings that could hold up to a game like Age of Empires. 

 That being said its not without its issues. I struggled to understand the hunting aspect of the game, as well as the cemetary and radiouses on buildings, and the controls could be more laptop/ trackpad friendly. My other beef with the game is that the tutorial isnt very detailed. Its kinda like, this is how you get food, this is how you get water, now go ruin your planet with polution. But again, the game is in alpha and the team is actually LISTENING AND RESPONDING to reviews. They seriously seem to care, and theres no doubt in my mind that some of these issues will be addressed and fixed, and that the final product will be top notch. 

 Some people complained about the price, however I was more than happy to give $30 to the team so they could develope this game into the piece of art its surely going to become.

The graphics are very good and you can lead your society down several different avenues, building a peaceful/wartorn society or an eco/polluting world. 
I was attacked by nuggets from another settlement and I quickly picked them up with telekinesis and drowned them. How strangely satisfying it is to kill a nugget! It takes me back to my days playing Populous when I used to lower the land to drown my own folk.
A lot of the focus of this game is about making your nuggets fall in love, keeping them fed and watered and providing them the resources to build and expand their settlement. If you miss something it comes back to haunt you especially in the winter when all your water freezes and the nuggets start filling up your graveyards. Come to think of it, I need a cup of tea.

I have now played this game for +/- 15 hours. And it’s a very pretty game. I love the humor, the colorfulness, …

When I first started the journey in getting to know this game I was rather confused about what certain things do. Nuggets were dying, farms weren’t doing well, didn’t have enough water in the winter,… In the end I had to many buildings to maintain and very little nuggets who were apparently not in the mood to give me baby nuggets. (I don’t want to force my godly love power on them… yes I am lazy)

It was an absolute disaster. And then I started thinking how am I such a horrible God? I mean people survived in the other God games. So I started to actually read what stuff did. Big help! I started to listen to the storyteller who is just so much fun to listen to. Great job on finding this voice actor!

And so I thought: let’s start all over again. So when I started a new game I started to build all the buildings that kept my people alive. I saw them grow, work, … Here and there I had to use my God power to help them a bit since I’m a very nice God even though people call me Satan in real life. As life progressed I have a few pointers that might come in handy or at least they would for me. I don’t know for others.

* The ability to link god powers to your keyboard. I have this amazing MMO mouse with loads of buttons that are just dying 
   to be pushed on. 

* Have the option to choose which recreational building I want to build. I have loads of massage centers. Pretty sure people  
  want their hair done someday. Might be me not having to found the button to change it. So don’t shoot me if you already 
  have it and I just failed to know how to do it.

* I sometimes wonder how the other civilizations are doing. As in real life I’m really reaaaaally bad at finding the way. So 
  somehow I usually don’t find them. Maybe you can mark them on the planet with some kind of color? 

* Might be a tic I have from Dungeon Keeper or Black and white… Please give me the ability to slap nuggets! I'll only use it 
  when they deserve it I promise...

* The option to turn buildings with your mouse. (Q and E is a weird combination for turning buildings probably because I 
   have an azerty keyboard). So if you make more options for keyboard: don't forget those people like me with a azerty 
   keyboard. As long as we can change the key bindings we'll be happy. 

* I would like to build 5 buildings in one go without having to go back via interface. 

Okay so I gave some pointers that might not be pointers because stuff already exist but I’m just oblivious. Or I actually made some strong points. Either way I have just started to exploring this game.

Also thank you for giving me the option to name nuggets! My friend appreciates it (no he doesn’t) when I tell him he has 14 children and then eventually dies (how I wish I could slap him though).

These are the pro's and con's I have with the game

Pro’s:

* Very beautiful and colorful 
* Clean UI
* Once you learn more about the game it’s easier to play
* Love the transformation of the houses, nugget’s clothes, …
* Narrator is awesome although his jokes get a the same over time
* You just want to discover more (can't wait to get to space!)
* It’s a good game becoming a great game
* Nice try with the developers joke about their humor (you almost got me)
* It’s not boring like the Sims 4 after one hour 
* We don't need phones to play it (for those who don't get it... it's a diablo joke)

Con’s

* Still in Alpha (it's only a con because I now want to explore more of this game) 
* Maybe make it easier to see which nuggets are single so i can use my godly powers? Sometimes nuggets don’t do 
   anything.  (by that I mean don't make babies, so from a population of 150 it suddenly goes to 50. I know you can't force 
   love but hey I have a city to build and buildings that need people to work in it)
* Buildings don’t get upgraded by nuggets
* I sometimes have issues with lag (mostly in creator mode)
* I can’t slap nuggets!
* Sometimes instead of ""Well has been build"" kinda sentence, I get the programming code. Mostly happens in creator 
   mode. (That's kinda counted as bugs which is very normal for a game in alpha)
* Rotation the building doesn’t really go that smoothly. Somehow I also have to use my Q and E key which is weird cause of 
  my azerty keyboard. Some keys that are explained in controls don't really work. 

Keep up the good work! To people who are doubting to buy this game cause it’s in Alpha, don’t!
Please buy this game to give the developers the chance to make it even better. That is if you like these kind of games of course.

This game plays like a modern version of Black & White (my favorite game of all time) and has improved upon the asthetic style of Spore. There's no gesture based casting of miracles, which is a tad disappointing but i get it. 

I played 9 hours before writing this review and i lost track of how many times i noticed i had a big goofy grin on my face. 
The Universim has promise and its enjoyable as it is now in alpha something. There is an abrupt cutoff right now and its made clear to you before you buy but theres enough meat here to get a good taste. 

There are balance issues right now:
-I never felt like i could generate a sustantial amound of belief to do something huge without planning for it, 
-what buffs/nerfs happiness in the village seems to be counterintuitive 
-and your subjects are pretty hard to impress enough to believe in you right now especially given the limited belief you have to spend on miracles. 

Graphics are a slice of absolute heaven. Everything is perfect, bright and whimsical! Trees, camera pans that hit stuff, fire oh my god fire is GORGEOUS. I wasn't even upset when a village i firebombed had a bug and the graphics of the flames wont go away! Just makes my nemesis seem cooler.

Overall I can't wait to see where this game goes. I love it already.

Though the game give you the abilities to cast different types of spells, move stuff around, placing buildings and watch the nuggets go to work like ants, there are several issues I would like to address in this review. This game is in early access, so I understand the game currently abruptly stop once you reach medieval age. 

Firstly, I would like to address the current tech tree. At some point when discovering electricity, you are forced to pick Wind Power, Combustion Power or Kinetic Power...  Why can we only discover 1 way to create electricity? It does not make sense, I would love the adversity and managing of being able to produce combustion or kinetic power when there is no wind as an example. This is a horrible and unrealistic way to give “player choice” and you seem to continue this througout the tree in the later ages as well. 

Secondly, as the player develop through the ages, more options to improve infrastructure should be given. Like roads, carts and future means for transportation. I hate seeing my village/city as a huge blob with no proper structure. If devs want to give players more direct managing of the city, at least let us make it look nice. I see there is a GIF on Steam store page showing the planet with highways and bridges, but there is currently no way to create your own roads or bridges. I would also hope more of a system to create aqueducts and later pipes or electrical grids. Though this last part may be too much to ask. 

Thirdly, the building menu and managing of workers is a mess! In the beginning with only a few buildings it is not a huge problem, but when progressing and increasing amount of buildings, need for micromanaging become much higher. There is a building menu where you can sort by name, workers, type etc. But it is in current state horrible and you will need to scroll through several pages, before you need to move to the building if you want to assign workers. Having an improved menu with better sorting and ability to assign workers directly should be implemented asap for convenience. Yes, you can build Town Hall later on to help out with auto assignment, but I found this feature to not work too well and managing the workers was still needed. I would also like an overview over what buildings is currently in construction or being upgraded. 

Fourthly(oh, I did not expect to keep going this far), I hope to see more conflict between the tribes. I was glad to see that non-player tribes was coming to life and making their own way somewhere else on the planet. But I miss further interactions with those tribes, like trade or war. None of the tech you develop allow your nuggets to learn trade, diplomacy or fighting. I would assume if my player-based tribe did not build on a mountain area, they could potentially trade iron with a neighboring tribe or go to war for resources. 

Fifthly( -_-), though I know Cryptivo is soon to release a new structure called The Prayer Enclave(google it), the current state of god choices is lacking significantly. While in Black & White you would be given different quests throughout the land, there was only a few popping up as a notification during my early gameplay in Universim and these did not affect my followers too much later on. Late game I was having a hard time to earn followers and it felt less like a god game, but more like a resource and worker managing game. Hopefully this will improve with the new structure. 

Now, there are a few bugs in this game. Like workers would mindlessly stop working and stand still doing nothing until they die or if you cast fire and it spread into the lake, it will continue to burn and spread under the water surface. But the game was for the most part pretty stable and had no major technical issues running. 

In conclusion, the game was decent until a point and I had some fun time playing it. But there are some major gameplay aspects and features lacking, not to mention that you only get to play up until the medieval era. The game currently does not look like anything as advertised in the video here on Steam, so I would warn others to tread with caution, as some early access titles may never complete or change their direction. I am giving Universim a thumbs down as I do not like the direction it is heading and I was hoping for a more diverse and immersive god simulation experience. 

P.S. Why cannot the nuggets just melt and boil the snow during winter to stay hydrated?",1543426117,1543426117,False,337,6,0.909676909446716309,10,True,False,True

My only complaint is early game wolf attacks, if you have no CP you can only sit and watch as dozens of nuggets die. My only request is that there is some sort of ""Defense"" research eventually so that they can defend themselves somewhat, or make watchtowers and hunters actually useful.

Note you cannot go into the modern age yet, the research tree cuts off at ""acoustics"" as they have not put anything else in, but everything up to that point is fantastic. Definitely worth the buy to see how far theyll go",1543365444,1543365444,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Great micro management

My first hour of experience was amazing as the early game was very engaging and entertaining as I started to bring
my civilization through the stone age.

Afterwards however the experience began to be marred by bugs of every nature from buildings not being built or upgraded
to Nuggets being stuck in an endless pick up/drop off loop.

At the end they wouldn't reproduce as nobody would build new houses leading to a sharp decline in population after I hit 120. I would have elders as the leads of a houshold and incapable of mating with 5-30 year olds also living in the same stone hut without upgrading it.

First the Likes:
>I love the fact that you can do things to indiviuals like cause them to fall in love, strike them with lightning or throw them in a lake
>I actually kind of like that upset nuggets run off to form their own civs which sometimes have some great names, such as Ankh-Morpork (Big Pratchett fan)
>the nuggets opinions of you is also a nice touch and how they can choose if they believe in you
>the art style is adorable
>I love the fact that there is a creatve mode

Now I know that the game is in alpha so I won't camplain about things like achievements not working, locked abilities, some buildings not working, nuggets getting stuck, a small pool of powers, there only being twoish ages or and I'm not sure if this is just me ... but corpses, corpses everywhere and no grave digger will do their job. I'm sure they will get fixed in time. 

The bad points:
>the narrator becomes quite annoying as others have said. It's funny the first time he tells you to look away when your nuggets are making the shack creak but after that it becomes somewhat of an annoyance.
>that being said that wouldn't be such and issue if you could place shacks yourself ... I mean nuggets don't place any other buildings, why shacks?
>there is a LOT of waiting ... normally I don't mind so much but even if you try to micro manage and make them all fall in love or heal all their boo boos you can't because you won't have any mana

A few ideas that I thought would be cool:
>some kind of spawn nugget power on creative
>a divine birth type power .... by year 250 I was left with nothing but four females XD all the dudes ran away to a new civ
>Avatar of god

It took nearly no time at all to see everything that this game had to offer, and it's current end game is less than half of what was promised on the trailer.  Perhaps the devs plan to continue to develop it, and there are glimpses of this in the game currently, but with how incredibly drawn out the development process is, I'm expecting the devs to cut and run after a while, or randomly say ""ok, done!"" with a game that is nowhere near finished.

I would love to put this on my ""play a year later"" list to see its progress. I would like to say a few things to both the creators and my fellow gamers about my experience.

First off let me address the elephant in the room. Yes this game is currently as of now an Alpha release. A lot of content is still in development. However the showcase video is misleading. Currently you can only reach medieval age, which is unfortunate. I would of refunded the game knowing this however I became invested in the gameplay up to the cap. As of now there is an average of 5-8 hours of gameplay depending on how aggressively you push for end game.

Now this is directed to the creators hopefully you happen to run across my comment. As an indie developer and passionate gamer please take these words to heart. Keep up the progress on this game as you have something unique. Despite saying this, there are several problems I'm seeing. I would classify this game as an ""AFK resource management game"" I can leave the game running for long periods of time and nothing would punish me for it which is far from interactive gameplay. My solution is adding more serious game-changing disasters and giving the creator abilities more interactions. It would also help to have the other civilizations advance at a faster rate and if you wern't careful with defenses and training armed militia you would be raided and possibly Game Over. Honestly What your game reminds me of is ""Spore"" perhaps taking some inspiration from that game would help with your game's future.

This is for the Gamer and I'll keep it simple. Is it worth picking up? Answer, Yeah if its on sale or you feel like you just gotta try it out.
Pros- 
5-8 hours of gameplay
Funny narration and tips
Great time killer
Decent Graphics
Lots of future potential
Music is pretty good

Cons-
Camera control is wack
The game tells you very little on how to play. (could be a good thing tbh)
There is a lot of AFK gameplay
No 3x speed button, only 1.5x speed, this drags out the game upgrading.
Creator Skills are pretty much useless and so is believer count.
General controls are also awkward to use.

It's major issue from my perspective is it's time acceleration. Most games of this nature allow you to increase the rate at which time passes. Universim (US because I'm not stopping to remember how to type that anymore) shares this, but whereas most time increase modifiers allow you to hit 5x and even 10x in some games, US's time can only be sped up twice, by 1.25 and 1.5.....with time maxed out, you're essentially just watching something that takes minutes to do take just a few less minutes.

That said and out of the way, US features a quirky narration system that might get old to some but I find pretty amusing. Some of the scripted things early on do need better guidance, though. Trying to bumble you know what my way through saving Little Timmy from a pack of wolves was annoying seeing as you're essentially being told to use an ability you've not used before, in a system that you've only been prompted to use once.

Did I mention that the vast majority of the help tooltips don't work?

Now at this point, I'm sure you're asking why am I leaving the positive review? Well....I'm going to say this loud and clear so that everyone understands it (hopefully).

I UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN EARY ACCESS ALPHA GAME

That said, the weather system brings noticible change to the map, there's no lag, the villagers are quasi-independant.

For city builders, this means:

You don'tr have to build their housing (pro). They do it themselves, so you have no control over where they go, but they seem to eventually gravitate to building them in their own little patterns (con).

You assign Nuggets, as they're called to US, to open jobs in new buildings....but then when they die, they're automatically replaced.

If you have questions, I'll try to keep up with them but I'm not looking to turn this into a job. I see the potential of this game and will be sticking with it, despite being in the refund window because I want to see where it goes.....

Don't get me wrong, the game is fun, but it is only fun when it works. My very first play through of the game was amazing, I had fun watching my nuggets live their lives and helping them whilst trying to gain followers.

But I once i got to the Nuggola Tesla quest I messed up. I didn't know where to place a mine so I couldn't complete it the way I wanted (I wanted to be a helpful creator and not ignore Tesla's call), so I decided to make a new world... that's where my troubles started. In my first world I could see Nuggola Tesla, but in the new game all I got from his message was an empty space. There was also no lightning to finish the quest and so I failed again. So I once again started another world... and guess what? Same thing happened. 

So I figured I would try one more time, make a new world, and see if I can see Tesla and finsih the quest. This world however bugged the heck out. I was messing with the new nugs when I noticed the music was skipping. I figured I would just go into the settings and shut off the music, and that is when everything just froze. the nuggets weren't moving, the music was still skipping, and nothing I could do would make it go away! Not even CTRL+ALT+DELETE would fix this mess! I had to power down my whole laptop to fix the mess.

Would I suggest buying it right now? No.

[b]-The review is out of date by two updates. I still recommend the game over all, but in a buyer beware state, the game is Early Access and it is not 'complete' as of yet. So if you buy it, do so to help find bugs, glitches, and performance problems. They are actively working on the game to finish it. The current concept behind the game is comparable to playing Black & White. (Without the cow avatar, for better or worse)

Will adjust the review once I familiarize myself with the newest changes and actually play the game again.-[/b]

I read a few reviews that disabled comments that brought up several bugs as reasons for not suggesting the game. Many of which I've not encountered myself. As an early access game, bugs [b]ARE GOING TO BE PRESENT[/b] and I believe using those as an excuse to not recommend a game is jumping the gun.

Right now, saving is noticably laggy. This is reguardless if the game uses the autosave or if you use the archive directly.

Many features of the talent/knowledge tree are 'coming soon'. (In other words, many features are still being implemented/worked on. They may be scrapped all to geather.)

I have not had the problem others have listed in reguards to my population not being able to recover after a disaster. I've had five tornados go through my little hamlet, and six wind storms. (Honestly the wind storms had no effect on my hamlet...) My population was able to bounce back each time. Nor have I experienced my Nuggets randomly dying out or 'just standing around'. [b](Keep in mind, that if someone has these issues then it's possible, but it's not guarenteed and may have something to do with placement of buildings or traits picked.)[/b]

The biggest annoyance is the lack of documentation, in-game, to help with various aspects. Some buildings simply have filler text code (perhaps someone forget a comma somewhere) while others have brief explanations of what they are. The lack of documentation in-game isn't a problem for everyone and may or may not be intentional. But it did cause a bit of trouble for me.

Another common complaint is the telekensis destroying a wild plant when trying to pick it up. [b]This happens (for me) [u]ONLY[/u] when the plant has no food.[/b] So it is best to double check the amount of food the plant has before trying to drag it around.

The confirmation (or, honestly lack there of) also causes problems wen you prioritize buildings. Something I agree that needs to be a thing if it isn't already intended. (I always click on it a few times just to make sure, or I suppose to make myself feel better.)

In creative mode (which you can only access after you first reach the medieval period) allows you to choose where to place Nugget housing. A feature I strongly believe should be part of the core game.

There is no clear indication on how you gain divine points. You cannot interact with, what I assume, is the shrine dedicated to you. You get a number indicating how many Nuggets believe in you... but that is about all. (I've only gotten followers after directly healing an injury outside of the tutorial line.)

So, as I said. The game is enjoyable and if they continue in this direction it will be well worth the money. From what I've read, it has potental with space travel (which would be awesome.) I cannot say much for what this game will be in the future. It may radically change.

Also, keep in mind that a review is just an opinion. There are aspects of the game I dislike (the controls and 'bumping into mountians') and aspects I enjoy. But I over all enjoy it enough that I would suggest it to friends.",1537654524,1541206434,True,9,0,0.6153373122215271,3,True,False,True

The graphics aren't so good it slows things down- but they are good enough that you can enjoy what's happening. The research tree system is a little strange to me: it's just a series of time-gates that you have to path out and prioritize. I never get the recreational stuff unlocked before my nuggets get depressed. The creater power point system is also not what I expected-- I figured it would be based on how many people have faith in you, but it seems to be a static tic over time. It's also kind of random when people will gain faith- then again I have only been a ""kind"" creator and healed/played cupid in order to keep things progressing, so it's possible being wrathful will get you more followers.

Currently a limited amount of gameplay- only a few hours worth before it plateaus. I'm interested to see how the government system works, as well as planetary travel- you can currently click on the *stars* (actually other planets I guess?) and it will list some information on them. Spoiler- there are a LOT of other planets, and every one can be clicked on. Tantalizing. 

Like I said, after a while it runs out of juice. After about 130 nugget population the game is basically over- it stops being able to save after a few hours (even with the archivist, clicking save manually will freeze the interface and they are no longer auto-saving) and its hard to get over 150 nuggets at one time. On my second attempt I got to 140 but both lakes I had built next to were drained and even though I had started developing water pumps at other locations my nuggets would not, for love or money, go finish a pump. I gave up after an hour straight of trying to salvage the situation by using creation powers- I think the limited research tree and some nugget pathing issues were my undoing.

Speaking of nugget pathing-- the longer I play the more bugs crop up, surprisingly or not. Nuggets start sinking into the planet and are unclickable, they will get stuck outside their job and die of thirst five feet from a well. In the end the planet looked uninhabited except for the occasional nugget who had to interact with something on the surface before they sunk below the crust again. 

In general the game gets laggy after about 100 nuggets (and a large village) whenever a tornado happens. My goal was to try and get to 200 nuggets and I can't quite make it there.

Overall I'm interested where this game will go. I am a little worried about the things I've read about how long it's been in developement/ how long people have been supporters and the game is only this far?

You can easly get hooked playing this game if you are into these styles of games. Been playing for over 40+ hours, mostly learning the in's and out of it I'm my own tutiual what works working out were things go figuring what to lay out for the nuggets first so problems dont happen. Restarted 7 times in all different areas. The game has it share of bugs they are getting fixed thank God but a few are still very bothersome.

(forgot to add this)
The school system doesnt work right, need redone. 1. the teacher is as dumb as the student is, how can the dumb teach the dumb anything it broken. 2nd. only two students being tought it should be 4 or 6. Also when Nuggets die the Stone huts are empty, those need to be refilled by New Adult Nuggets. re-used.

1. Nuggets are somehow going under the ground keeping you from clicking on them.
2. They Walk into the lakes as if there is no water.
3. Nuggets will die easily in winter
4. Once Medieval age hits they all start getting Lazy or becoming hermits or overeating this causes a world of issues you can do nothing about.

Of the above number 4. reproducing becomes a stalemate it stops near to nothing you have to use your ""God Powers"" to make them do it and then Nuggets still die to fast cause you to use power forcing them to mate, Building becomes absent all they do is walk around even clicking on the prioritize hardly helps, you'll waste over 10 minutes before they start doing something.

God Power to me here is a joke even in Creation Mode. Being a ""God"" in this you suppost to be a Creator, however. It's far from it, Being a God, a Creator should enable you to Build the planet as you see fit, Having unlimited power but here you are highly restricted. Restrictions really??? Your a GOD for crap sake. I want to move mountains if want to, Your not suppost to place things to make them build.. Yea its like being a giving god putting that out but isnt that what the Nuggets are supposed to do invent from ideas, However this is telling them what to do. You have limited power and you run out of it from a number count, followers give you more power...??? why?? Should this be a thing at all?

In Creation Mode you dont have follors not the number limition that goes with it. However you have to constantly make them reproduce cause the Nuggets wont.

All'n all it has a lot to offer bugs and irretations and all but I like playing but wish to hell something would get fixed very soon. Would i recommend this game.. maybe but only if you like these game types. i bought it for my self to check out out and to help the Devs out too cause i see potential here over that spores game i hated.

UPDATE (Oct '18):  Was going to start thinking postively for these guys after an update but they're applying favourable answers as ""answered"" in threads that are critical of them (instead of allowing the OP to decide) and then locking so you can't query the answer given. Now it seems locking (and deleting) critical threads - no matter how civil - is the norm. Even where people are asking whether to buy, they lock it up if they don't like the answers. These are NOT abusive rants breaching any Steam rules either - this is censorship. 

Check out the ""posting guidelines"" ruleset on their front page. It sets the tone for your discussion if you should be unhappy with something. Being civil and polite is not enough, your posts have to agree with everything they've done and continue to do.

And now... for the original review...

I rarely write negative reviews but when I do there's a reason for it. More to the point, I rarely flag an EA title but when I do there's going to be a reason.

[h1]UNIVERSIM[/h1]
Time flies when you're having fun.... and time is not on our side with this title......

This is fun [i]with what you get[/i] and as we've come to expect it's full of some seriously SIMPLE errors that should not have got past basic testing. Typos abound, game freezes, poor AI, performance issues and general all round ugliness. 

But hey, it's EA right? Yeah. I know. (and I make more allowances than most for EA). 

Except.... almost 12k backers pledged $387,000 dollars onto this [u]more than 4 years ago[/u]. When I saw the trailers on Steam it had planes, buildings, planets, nuclear power plants, a whole heap of content - all under the auspice of ""early pre-alpha gameplay"". 

So what happened? Where the fudge is the ""gameplay"" you're showing on the trailers?
 
Indeed. This has just been ""released"" to Steam as an EA title with a fraction of the content, almost 3 years late off the kickstarter (it was promised to [u]finish[/u] in October 2015). There is nothing in the store information to tell me that most of what I should expect is NOT in the game.

But I SAW it. With my own eyes. So wtf is going on?

EA is meant to help developers, well, develop. When it's a new project with some gameplay to get us all excited and invested then we're all on the same page. We play, we test, we report, we suggest, we argue, we... well, become the game for you.... with you.

But I gotta' ask.... EXACTLY WTF DID YOU GUYS DO FOR FOUR YEARS?

If this took 4 years and $400k to get here, how much more is it going to take to get this over the line - you know, up to where the trailer is? So..... either the rest of this is coming in rushes, with anticipatory kudos for the devs for ""rapid development"" or we've got us a problem.

Sure... playable (and I'll play what I got) and yes, I'll update this review accordingly but the hairs on the back of my neck are tingling. What we have gets an 8/10. What we don't have, gets a wary eyebrow.......

Not entirely convinced about this one. Caveat Emptor.

(NOTE: ""but it's EA"" comments will be killed off because that's not my problem here. Ask yourself, if the stuff shown WAS ""gameplay"" - where is it now? If it wasn't in the game and was done just for the trailer, a lot of time and backers money has been spent on PROMOTION not PRODUCT.)

My biggest complaint about this game is the research tree. The order of technology makes no sense in it's current state. One of the first things you can (and should) research in this game is the water wheel(really it's more of a pump) followed by the resevoir. However if you want to teach your nuggets to weave clothes or hunt animals you're going to have to wait a while. You learn how to make fire and cook right away but if you want to boil water that's going to take a while too.

Another issue is that above ground resevoirs don't freeze but in ground wells do plus wells take forever to fill. Using the water wheel drains the body of water you're pulling from and unless you spend creator points to make it rain you'll pull water faster than it refills. I think the water use rate maybe too high.

They've added in aggressive tribes of nuggets now along with the wild animals that will attack you. The watch tower defense isn't available right away and it's the only (at least the first in the tree) defense that I've found. I think there should be a guard shack earlier in the game and/or move the hunters up and make them go into defensive mode when the village is under attack. When animals attack the nuggets never try to kill them they just run around until you spend creator points to kill the animals or if you have researched weather you can sound an alarm bell to tell everyone to go home although some of them still run around and just get killed.

Different types of crops have to be hand delivered by you, the creator. This means if you want to give your nuggets access to more than one type of crop you have to search the world to find them in the harvest season, pick them and then drop them in the farmers lap. I think this a task the nuggets could perform on their own. Gathering should be an early game research ability. Once the nuggets get upgrading to farming any crops they've gathered should be available for planting.",1538926315,1538926315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- The save process through the archives lags tremendously.  
- Crops randomly explode with telekinesis rather than them being uprooted.  (To work around the issue, you should uproot a tree and discard it, and then pick up the plant of interest as that sometimes (but not always) helps.)  
- No confirmation when prioritizing building
- Cannot prioritize upgrades, or cancel them, for that matter
- Population will inexplicably decline (sometimes by 50%) with no reason.  You can have plenty of food and water with losses being due only to old age, but yet the population won't recover from a major decline.  This causes stagnation in production.  Usually, you will notice that the unmated population is either entirely female or male when this issue occurs.
- Building a new wind turbine causes all wind turbines to stop functioning.  To work around this issue, you can save and reload your game.
- There are disasters (eg, wind storms or twisters) that quite frankly should not yet be included in this alpha version because the population doesn't recover
- Whenever you open the research menu, the music stops, but will restart after some time. 
- Most abhorrently, the nuggets all just suddenly will stand still, ultimately succumbing to starvation or thirst.  

Just too many bugs that make a decent gameplay impossible.

Folks, just remember you're paying $30 for an alpha version that doesn't work very well quite yet.  I will update my review when the bugs are fixed because this game is otherwise addicting and fun and has a LOT of great potential!

P.S. if you watch the second promo video, then have you wondered who on earth (or whatever planet these people live on) would launch a rocket in the middle of downtown?  I cannot think of ONE thing that might go wrong with that action.

I decided to give this one another shot. After my first review, I gave the current content another couple playthroughs, and my experience was vastly different. The game is still definitely rough around the edges. But you can defintely enjoy a few hours of fun with the game as it currently sits. I've changed my review to recommend the game, based on the hope that it will only get better. The price is a bit steep for what is here now, that's the nature of early access I think. Keep that in mind if you're considering buying into it.

I was able to get two games to about 100 nuggets and maxed out tech tree. I think this is because I got really lucky with the dissasters, no tornados actually hit my village, and I only lost a couple nuggets to a windstorm in one game (I think the windstorms might actually be bugged or something, they rarely do any damage or kill nuggets). The only real gameplay issue I found this time around was there isn't any way to split the population. The first game through I didn't close to any desert, and I chose the gas route for power, not knowing I would need the desert biome. I was able to build the plant far off eventually, but it would have been easier if there was a way to convince the nuggets to start a new little group, and maybe link them up with courier huts. 

tl;dr: May last two playthroughs were a lot more fun the first few attempts. I knew more and anticipated what I would need better. That said, there is only about 3-4 hours max content here for a playthrough. Keep that in mind. 


--Orginal Post--
This game is in a pretty rough state as it currently is. There are plenty of reviews that say that, but I decided to give the game a go after watching some other folks playing it. From a management/strategy perspective, everything in the game is pretty much tied to the clock, which doesn't feel great. 
My first game was going great, I was more or less having fun, I had a modest little civilization going with around 40 nuggets (citizens) and things were progressing nicely. A tornado came through and killed some of my nuggets. No big deal I thought, just a set back, roll back some of what I was doing, try and build back up again. Try as I might for over an hour, I couldn't get the little buggers to mate at all, everything had hit a standstill. So half my people were killed, and all population growth flatlined. I couldn't get them going again. The civ literally died of old age, and the buildings just fell apart. 
I can understand the management aspect of making sure there is enough water for winter, and food to eat, but what is a player supposed to do with a game that just doesn't want to be played. Maybe I'm just bitter for 'losing' but I don't feel like that play through was a good use of my time. I didn't learn anything at all that I could use in another play through. I guess I could rush the tech tree to get the bunker and make sure I have maximum survivability. But then that must mean there is only one way to play this game in it's current state. 
Just save yourself some heartbreak and give the game a few more months to mature. Hopefully if the devs keep updating and listen to feedback your experience will be a good one in the future. The game looks great, and the premise is solid, but even core mechanics still lack polish at this point.",1538435901,1538843263,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,True

Bugs are abundant atm which is to be expected and they forewarn you of this as it is still in alpha and alot of things need to be done and fixed.

Gameplay at presant feels quite slow to the point you could accually fall asleep waiting for things to happen, but im also aware that enemies arnt fully itterated into the game yet. The research does need to be sped up a little and i also feel that the kids need to take longer time before they can become adults and possibly have some sort of education system for them instead of educating the adults only. The fact that the nuggets get to place there own housing is a bit annoying especially when you have ocd and try to create a perfect settlement and end up having nuggets doing there own thing with housing. Also alot of the mechanics arnt fully explained properally and can feel somewhat disorientated when not knowing how something works. The current enemy or neutral factions that are not your own also feel out of sorts as they only seem to place houses and nothing else but i expect that is due to it being a new or tempory feature. Defending your settlement when being attacked is also somewhat confusing. Lastly the progress research tree also needs to be more flushed out aswell and not so 'take item a and progress to item z'.

All in all though the game is fantasting and has an enjoyable feel to it that i can definately see myself playing hours and hours in once it is complete. At presant though i would recomend grabbing this game to support the developers and let it sit in your library until it is complete or at the very least alot more flushed out.

Great game so far, Shame your civ just stops right now bc it isn't fully fleshed out, however it does look very promising and has a ton of potential perhaps becomming a modern Black&White2 and/or Spore Hybrid. I'd like to see more control on houses however, maybe designated spots where they can build their huts, rather than placing them myself just highlight an area where they are allowed to build them. Seeing more animals and enviroment would be nice too, and domesticating the animals for work or happiness ect. Obviously the devs will add in a lot in the future but there are a ton of small things that'd be nice, have to wait and see what direction it goes however. Can't wait.

Game has nearly limitless potential and i can't wait to see what they do with it. 
Mentioning Black&White2 however (another god/civ game) it would be cool to see God Powers like that in this game even city construction and A.I along the same lines ect. I pretty much really got into this game bc of how much it reminds of of the love i had for B&W2 and want to see if they gather some ideas from it. It also gives off a bit of a Spore feeling too which i really like.

A good 75% of the game is not yet accessible to the player with tags across the UI mentioning features that are ""coming soon."" There are some other minor noticeable bugs across the game, especially related to graphics and character rendering and camera controls. 

However, with the negatives being said, this game has great potential and has wonderful gameplay mechanics. I'm really excited for the full game as Universim is going to be one of the most interesting and full-featured god/world sims on Steam. Despite the bugs and lack of features, the game already is engaging, and attention sucking. 

For instance, in my first time playing, with no tutorial, my initial planet survived multiple tornadoes, ensuing water shortages, and a massive outbreak of depression that almost wiped out the population, after getting through that little period of distress, the game mellowed out pretty quickly as I ran up against the ""coming soon"" barriers. The depth and in detail in the Early Access version promises a great game that I am excited to see ""coming soon.""",1538263781,1538263781,True,4,0,0.55102074146270752,0,True,False,True

It has brought me hours of joy. However it also brought me alot of dissapointment. 

Reading the store front, you speak of advanced ages and such but they are not in the game. 

The store front is very misleading and when we are being honest here. There is not that much in the game as descriped on the page or shown. I have not seen a single sky craper, or plane. Playing the story mode, I was under the impression I would be able to move on to the next planet and such experiencing building a colony in a different enviorment. Which is why I initially bought the game.. I feel honestly betrayed by the fact that the store front displays things that are not yet really in the game. As much as I love the game as it is right now. It is not what I believed id be buying.

From the looks and feels of the game it's clearly a mix of Spore and Cities Skylines while roleplaying as a god.
The game, as it states, is still in very early stages and is nowhere close to being finished. It is a test of it's core elements and to be honest it is working quite well. The graphics are cute and simple, the game mechanics are very simple for now, and the amount of content is OK. The game is OK. To be fair, roleplaying as a god while guiding your civs through evolution is quite amusing and this game will be recommended by me.

This game is a civilisation simulator with the focus on being environmental friendly.
The first 'level' of the game, the stone age, is nearly complete and well playable. The second stage, when you enter the tudor age, you start running into unfinished content. I advise to stop playing at that point for now.

Will give you at least a few hours of enjoyable gameplay in it's current state.

I had fun, although there are a few niggles that I hope will be smoothed out.  The tech tree is a bit of a mess, and it's very easy to miss important early research that could lead to unnecessary deaths or even a colony wipeout. Also, dealing with water needs is an absolute pain. Resevoirs don't hold nearly enough water, and even a moderately sized colony of 50 or so can blow through 5 or 6 max upgraded resevoirs in a single winter period. Also, the nugget management screen needs to show ill health effects, and allow you to pop up the Nugget info box directly from the management interface. As it stands right now, you have to find the nugget on the manager window, click the button to focus the camera on the nugget, then select the nugget to get the nugget info box. Too many steps, and you can still select the wrong nugget if there are a few standing around together by the nugget you want.  My final gripe is that getting believers and dealing with the ""god points"" in general is frustrating. Helping build structures gives you believer points... except when it doesn't. You end up sitting around a lot of the time, at least in the early game, just waiting for your points to tick up enough to let you use a god power... and don't get me started on misclicks costing god powers and not doing anything! God point increases feels like it should be effectively doubled, and misclicks shouldn't waste your god points.

All in all, it's a lot of fun. I'm going to revisit the game when more content is added, and I'm hoping the niggles I have above get sorted out during that time.

Felt similar to Black & White but more revolving around encouraging nuggets (the villagers) to grow and expand their settlement.
Lineage Legacy- Able to give nuggets a secondary name which they will pass onto their offspring, however the names that are generated could do with tweaking with a mod or a pre-chosen list like nordic etc.

Cons:
The tech tree feels badly done at the moment. Being able to mine gas and iron ores while still being in stone huts feels odd, not to mention that alot of stuff will have minor impacts that you dont really see (increases to nuggets might, speed etc).
Nugget management- you can set nuggets to priorities building certain things but otherwise you cant tell them to properly harvest what wood/stone or food properly.
Belief/interactivity- You gain a small amount of belief from your nuggets over time depending on how many believe in you. This can make it handy and frustrating at the same time like when you get a nugget request but dont have enough belief to do it. Belief also limits how much interaction you can have on your village apart from setting down buildings.
Lack of buildings- Only two ages currently available; Stone age and Tudor age, nothing more advanced after that.

Overall: The game is obviously still in early development and has alot of potential should they add in later modern  and scifi buildings and the possibility of colonising other plannets as they originally said, however until they do I wouldn't put a price tag of £20 to it and would say with its current amount of play it is worth more around £5-10 at most.",1537038248,1537038248,True,8,1,0.590644240379333496,0,True,False,True

(Since it is in EARLY STAGE, I'll tolerate bugs).

- the windstorms are too frequents and last too long -- incredibile boring even when you've bunkers.
- the tornato alert is dismissed with no tornados and then it may came anyway when you already sent all out of the bunkers.
- people are assigned automatically to building not yet constructed. They even die saying they did a great job there despite the building is not built yet!
- you cannot control how people build. I've had building 10 hours awating  to be finished and still do not know why nobody completes it, despite ALL resources were delivered ages earlier.
- if you remove people from building assignement like cemetery to keep 1 of 2 workers, you go back and the place has been filled by another guy.
- faith is too slow to grow, I hate this part of the game, you're not a god, just a watcher.
- later in the game, faith keeps growing slower and slower, despite you have 50 or 100 habitants
- when you add a beleiver, soon one will be removed
- technology tree is not clear in all its paths or what's for?

Things I like of this game.

- very detailed, you can follow each of your habitant
- there is some logic, i.e. they need to drink, eat and love and you have to do this more and more
- lots of buildings to do
- you can play for hours relaxing
- you can go away and come back and nothing is destroyed
- pace is very slow (this may be a con too)

There are a few things to work out still regarding gameplay, but it's early access.

Things I like:

- You get the feeling like you're watching your civilization grow by itself, and you're there to guide and teach. A great role for a diety.
- The mechanics of the game are very stable, the upgrade paths make sense, and you know what you're doing pretty intuitively.
- The comedy & NPC actions are fun to engage with, track, and observe.
- There's a certain level of customization, say if you don't want to kill animals,  you can find ways to avoid it. I imagine as the tech tree expands, that those options too will expand and impact gameplay.

Things I think can improve:

- Sometimes after a disaster, or say running out of a certain material, the nuggets almost forget how to breed, and you can, very very quickly, find yourself with no population and a bunch of empty buildings. It would be nice to be able to issue edicts or something that allowed you to control population that way. If left to their own devices, the nuggets will overpopulate the world and you'll have a real problem on your hand....there's no real way to control this, and the eventuality is destruction. Maybe more things in the tech tree help here too..unsure.
- Dropping things is sometimes difficult and doesn't line up with your intention, I've broken several buildings - it's silly.
- Would be nice, from an ecological perspective, to help replace water/fish/trees. I don't see any options for forestry etc. All you can do is pillage resources, not replace them.
- Schools should have a greater impact, and the results should be measureable.
- The quest about finding the kid, early on in the game, I have never resolved despite multiple attempts.
- Farms seem unclear and hard to use (specifically getting other types of fruit/veggies) and just seemed harder than fishing. Fishing, depending upon the size of the water source, seems like an infinite resource, so it's uncertain why you'd hunt or farm.
- There's a lack of clarity on how to unlock new god powers, creation as an example.
- Cosmetics never populate
- I haven't been able to get far enough to really leverage power for buildings, assuming these features are coming, but it's confusing.
- Town hall/government system doesn't seem to work yet.

Hope this helps, eagerly awaiting patches and updates - very unique experience, and absolutely worth buying.

After reading the reviews I was not expecting much. 
And true, this game is still in early access and it shows: The tech tree has many technologies that have ""not yet implemented"" as effect. But there are already many more that are implemented already.

[b]The good[/b]

[list]
[*]The graphics are very pretty, the gameplay is fluent (tested with up to 120 Nuggets at a time) and it is available on Linux from the start.

[*]Gameplay-wise it is clearly Populous inspired with some influence from Black&White (minus the creature). 

[*]Updates are frequent with many new features being implemented regularly.
[/list]

[b]The not so good[/b]
[list]
[*]As in reality the fight against Atheism is very draining: Your mana ( called ""faith points"" here) is depending on how many Nuggets believe in you. How many people believe in you is depending on how much faith points you spend doing crazy stuff. No believers --> No faith points --> No miracles --> No believers... Also Nugget parents do not talk to their Nugget-children about God. So if they die (as they always do after about 40 years) you have to re-convince their children that you are indeed real. The effect of miracles is not always obvious and certainly not tied to their cost. I spend hundreds of mana points skipping winter every year and this ended up convincing maybe 4-5 Nuggets. Lifting up a tree (5 Mana points) once convinced 3 Nuggets at once. 
[*] Nugget population sometimes likes to decline (naturally) very fast for no obvious reason (yeah, ok, they all got old and died at once). Despite having a happy, well fed and healthy population for some reason your Nuggets might decide to not have children, Creating a big hole once they decide to all die.
[*] User Interface needs work: In particular it needs more tooltips. It took me hours and 3 typhoons to realize that I have to click the little bell on the top of the screen to get my nuggets into the bunkers when a storm approaches. I assumed they would do this automatically given that there were bunkers and a weather tower in place...
[*] Middle ages follows immediately after stone age. In fact you can have electrified stone-huts since electricity is researched bevor the technology that triggers the middle ages. (not really a big deal I admit)

You start off by a soothing voice explaining how the universe was made and how you now are the creator of a mother planet. You then are introduced to your two nuggets (sims, humans, your chosen first, etc).
If you like humor, resource building/management, developing villages/cities, and the choice to be a helpful or non helpful creator, then this is your game.
You can help them build things and heal them ORRRRR you can flood them, change the season on them, and throw rocks into their buildings (accidentally did this to my temple and yes I made them worship me).
It is easy to do a test run to get the hang of things and then start over doing the layout for your city that you feel is best. This game has so much potential and hasn't had any big issues so far. 
They are working on more content (rewards for doing tasks says coming soon) so for now I am exploring everything, researching everything, and getting prepped for the full game. It is also fun to go from a nice helpful diety to FEEL MY WRATH NUGGETS HOW DARE YOU WORSHIP ME LESS THAN YESTERDAY *floods village and throws rocks at their homes*.
The music is very relaxing as is the narrator's voice. The graphics are refreshing and colorful. The sounds are actually pretty good, for this game to be released in ALPHA today I am super impressed with it.
I thought I experienced a glitch but turns out it was raining on my planet, it actually looked like water drops on my screen (kudos to you because that was awesome and unexpected).

After playing for about 5 hours I have discovered there may be intergalactic travel and moving to other planets in the future. This is very exciting as it would combine so many games that I enjoy.

Update at 9 hours: Once you hit 130ish population it starts to lag a bit, animal attacks are now happening which is pretty cool and surprised the f outta me (use telekinesis and pick the animals up then fling em to their death to solve this), it wouldn't save so that sucks but I mean it is in ALPHA and I love doing new things so it's fine. You can also use your divine powers to force your nuggets (people) to make babies (worker bees) if animals massacre your village.
All in all I feel like I will be playing this for a long time, but if I still cant save after I hit medieval times I will be sad lol.

UPDATE AT 19 HOURS:
The save issue was fixed a few days after launch, one of the fastest fixes I have seen in an early access game. I maxed everything that was available (to medieval time) on the regular mode and unlocked creator mode (which is super fun and am still working on it). Safe to say this game is alot of fun still.

The overall game concept is extremly unique. It is a mixture of cities skylines and Rimworld in some aspects.

The art style is nice. It has a very colorful feel.

This is the part of the review y'all may or may not disagree with but allow me to show y'all why I reccommend this game.

This game has the potential to be a very fun, replayable, deep game that I could play for days on end. It is not there yet. As you can see I have played 3 hours as of writing this review and I have acquired most of all the research that is currently in the game. Sure, it is incomplete, but it is not broken.

Honestly, there isn't a happy medium when it comes to developing a game. It's either the game is released as a 1.0 and is still broken to hell and no one can actually play it, or the game takes too long to complete because the developers want to make it perfect but people are impatient. What would you all rather have: a game in which you pay $30 for and you feel like you have been scammed, or a game that sits in your library for a while but will eventually become a masterpiece.

I get it, everyone (including me) can be a little impatient but the development team said they are going to release monthly updates and those will be pretty big updates from what I presume. The devleopers also explained how everything you saw in the trailer is an actual piece of the game, but it is not up to the quality standards of being released yet.

So, is the game perfect right now? No. Does the game have the potential to become perfect? Yes. In all honesty, I would buy the game right now to support and encourage the development team. Otherwise, I would wait and keep it on your wishlist.

Needless to say, I am very pleased with this game, and absolutely adore it. I've always loved Simulation Games, and to have a game that is a nice mixture of Black and White with a touch of City Skylines/The Sims is really nice, granted you don't have as much controll as you would with The Sims and City Skylines. 

Your subjects (Nuggets), start off practically in the stone age (cavemen days as I call them) and work their way through time. It's up to you to decide what they are capable of creating, and your placement for building such as a water well, factory, etc... 

What you do also effects the planet which you inhabit. So, killing too many animals can cause extinction, and using your water sources will eventually drain them (though I don't think the game is at it's point NOW because you can go forever without really needing to worry about anything). 

This game needs some patches really fast, and one issue is that of saving your game. It tends to freeze or stay stuck on the ""Saving Game"" menu for a long time unless you go into a different menu. Other then that, I would give this game a solid 8/10 stars. 

The Cons are really just the bugs that need to be patched. Besides the save game issue, your Nuggets can sometimes get stuck in a loop such as constantly dropping and picking something up. This usually occurs when you have 2-3 buildings that you've placed that need to be built. I think it throws the A.I. or something off? 

The Pros are that you get a wonderful game with beautiful graphics. It's got simple controlls, and it's everything I could want in a ""God Simulator"". I just can't wait till you are able to have the choice to inhabit more then one planet, or travel to another. 

I also forgot to mention that the nuggets do everything themselves for the most part. Your job is to heal them, and make sure they're happy, etc etc... With your God-Like Powers. :)",1536520367,1536520367,True,0,0,0.498383611440658569,0,True,False,True

The game is very playable with no game-breaking bugs that I could find.  It feels like it is in a fairly fit state for content to be added, rather than being released for the purpose of bug-testing (which is what early access should be).

I generally really like how things fit and work together, but some features I would like to make it even better:

* Micro-management should be completely optional.  I like the idea of being able to influence your Nuggets a lot or a little and wouldn't mind if they were able to build their civilisation on their own (they already build their own huts).
* My civilisation went into a depression spiral and I wasn't fully aware of it.  I don't mind spirals like that, I don't think it necessarily means more balancing is needed - it is simply the way to lose the game.  But some warning would be helpful.
* Especially when micro-management becomes more optional, I would prefer more little quests - in fact, there should always be a number of requests from believers or would-be believers to keep things interesting.
* It isn't clear to me if the civilisation will research on their own if I don't select items from the tree?  (I might try it, but it would be good to know upfront)
* It feels like their should be a few steps in between stone huts and tudor houses
* I couldn't understand why I couldn't select one building and only found out from the building menu that it is a temple.
* More actions should be available in the temple - maybe something like being able to use power points to automatically do things like make nuggets happy, or make them fall in love or heal them when they go into the temple (it should maybe be marginally more expensive than micro-managing it)

The only bugs which were immediately obvious was where nuggets seem to get stuck underground or just being invisible (these have been mentioned a few times).

I know it is an early access and all that, and I would actually reccommend the game if this was all there is to it.

The reason why i am not though is simply... I nodded off twice while playing this game. Not from a lack of trying and interest, but between throwing dead corpses in lakes (I don't build crematoriums since it has negative effect on happiness) and watching people being flung into the atmosphere for no apparent reason (bug), I was mostly just staring at the screen, watching my nuggets work - besides the lake filling task, most of my time is spent placing structures - like a very slow version of SimCity, where you only place civic buildings. Where your nuggets decide to settle is not in your control, untill your civilization gets to a certain size and you see the patterns (Hexes).

The game is fun enough - The ""Guide"" or whateter you call him (like the devil and angel in Black n' White) is nice enough through the first hour, but then he just goes dorment, only commenting if you happen to fly over a hut with two nuggets going at it. But i guess his dialogues just arent all added to the game yet.

I'd advise waiting untill this game isn't as sleep inducing.

Surprisingly, I hadn't heard of this game until I came across it this morning. This also means that I had not heard of the 4-year issue that some people have spoken of. I've also been gaming since Half-Life originally came out, so I've witnessed many flops and many unfulfilled promises. I love all types of games, from turned based strategy to FPS'. With that said, if this small team can keep up with the demands of a project that has this much potential, they will make a true mark on the gaming world.

That's a lot of pressure for first-timers. But if they keep to their update-per-month, I believe they can garner a true following. 

To put this into perspective, I remember playing Black and White when it first came out. I remember the goosebumps I felt when the intro played and how I couldn't wait to play more after school. Having no other information when I started this game, when your ""click"" causes the big bang...I got those very same goosebumps. This is something that hasn't happened for years! 

If you're not into early access, so be it; just click the ""follow"" button and move on for now. But I do recommend this game, though cautiously. This could change if they keep to their promises of regular updates (once per month). If you’re like me, however, and don’t mind a bit of risk, this is a good one for a potential big payoff.

Its a nice way to kick back relax build a little bit when you have time to kill.

There are some random bugs that pops up, from not being able to save, Buildings not upgrading, clipping issues, and starving nuggets not being able to find eateries that have plenty of food and seats available and eventually dying.

Things that needs to be addressed.
1. The pace - for example you have to guess which evolution will trigger some kind of new need for your tribe after refined materials you have to invest in culture and businesses or otherwise your nuggets will start dropping from unhappiness. 
2. Resources - at first you will be able to build just about anything with ease if you put your village in the middle of a forest though if your advancement don’t go at a quick enough pace while balancing your pop at about 100 - 150  you will soon run out of forest and upgrading will become hard work. most of the time you will be trying to play a balancing act between your water pump/reservoir construction and the resources you see , because once upgrades become available you are going to be struggling to upgrade these buildings.
3. Waiting simulator - on this game you will find yourself waiting most of the time to build up enough GP or for the next evolution to happen , there needs to be some filler , in order to make sure your village survives you have to know what to use next and it kind of gives the game a linear feel.
4. Powers and balancing - As a creator you feel your powers of creation is so underwhelming all the while useful powers such as the ability to pick up items cost too much to be of any real use , now look I assume someone who does not believe in you will crap themselves and run away when you pick up a rock or tree in front of them , but the believers would be happy.
5. Disasters - the rate just becomes ridiculous , having to push my nuggets into shelters for 7 minutes making them starve or die from thirst , I had one game where I had to deal with a tornado every 3 seasons

Some ideas for powers :
- Picking up and dropping should not cost points , it will also be it easier to defend against wolves,
- Give me the ability to throw something without having to scroll up 
- instead of the progress bar for picking up maybe use right click so you don’t pick up what you don’t want to 
- Give a creator powers of creation , let me at a balanced cost of mana do something usefull like create a forest , a pile of rocks , or even a blessing where I can drop a pile of Chopped rock and Wood in a neat package in the middle of my village.
- Avert disaster , let me protect my village from a disaster 
- Gift of immortality - at a great cost of points you can bless one of your nuggets with immortality (wont die of age) and a lot of hit points so they don’t die when a wolf sneeze in their general direction. That way naming nuggets actually have some purpose.

Just a few thoughts I hope you will consider , I am recommending the game for what it can become , not what it is right now.

352720,44634060,76561198032343653,145,28,1916,0,835,1645288912,"I've been playing this game a lot for quite some time now and here are some of the things I have noticed:

1. There’s no actual tutorial on how to maneuver the controls so it is a bit confusing at first but after a bit of time exploring and trying out the controls (and maybe start a new game after some time), you’ll get the hang of it.

2. I know it said that there’s little to no micromanaging in this game since the nuggets just do things on their own. But sometimes, I just find it annoying that those nuggets would suddenly place their homes wherein it is way too far from their basic necessities and/or placed in areas that I’m eyeing to place a specific building that I want to place. So if you’re the type that wants to place buildings in strategic locations, it might be off-putting for you.

3. The graphics are beautiful and the sounds are relaxing. I enjoyed the fact that your screen may have a bit of cracks when you zoon in and there’s a rocky mountain on the way or the fact that when it rains/moving your screen pass clouds, there are droplets of water on your screen. That is just amazing. Listening to the background music while playing is also very relaxing.

4. Currently, there are a lot of bugs in this game which is pretty obvious considering that it is still in early access. Here are some of the bugs that I noticed so far
a. Performance issues when saving/auto saving (the game would lag a bit)
b. Some texts (specifically in the tool tip) would be unreadable. I don’t know why but it would sometimes show random special characters
c. There are still some buildings that doesn’t have any text placed when you move your cursor to the “?” (but this might already be updated by now so I’m not sure)
d. Sometimes there are glitches like a wolf floating in a bunch of trees but you cannot click on it nor do anything. It may be because it has been killed already or something.
e. When I try to cancel one of my research queues sometimes it cancels a tech that I didn’t want to be cancelled. Making me surprised why I didn’t have that tech yet. Not sure if it is plainly my fault and I just didn’t notice but it has been frequently happening to my new games.

5. Story wise, there’s none. The nuggets do have their own stories when you look at their perspective. But this is a God game so….you just let things flow as it is unless you name your nuggets one by one and then use your powers to make them fall in love and create your own little story that is totally up to you. (Mind you…naming them one by one is rather taxing especially if you already have a 100+ running around and drinking lake water and then getting sick to the point of death lol)

6. In terms of gameplay, now this is gonna be a bit of a long list so here’s what I noticed so far:
a. For starters, the game can be a bit challenging especially when you pick where you want your evolution tower to be placed. Since you don’t get the exact same terrain you previously had when you play a new game, thinking of where to place it may take some time (or at least in my case, I did take my time to that point that it was already winter and I still couldn’t decide where to place the tower and I wanted to wait after winter is over so that my nuggets wouldn’t die upon placing them in the world).
b. Another reason why the game can be a bit challenging is because when winter comes, wolves attacking your nuggets would often happen a lot and surprising you on what to do if you don’t have watchtowers yet. Plus, you cannot always save them from those attacks. There’s also the issue of limited water and food during winter and you only have limited amount of points to use your powers so you’ll have to choose wisely when that ever happens.
c. Tech research is a bit slow for me. Sometimes I have to wait for a significant amount of time for an important tech and then problems arise making you desperately want that tech right away. That’s also a challenge since you need to pick the tech that you want to prioritize first. Sometimes you even have to force yourself to advance your research just to get a specific tech you needed already (like watchtowers). Mind you, it can be fun to strategize what tech to do first but sometimes, it is annoying due to how slow the research is completed.
d. I also find it really slow when I try to look at my roster of nuggets and scroll up and down the list. I sure would want it to be faster so that I don't have to spend too much time just scrolling up and down the list.
e. It is a shame that you cannot place a building or use some of your powers while the game is paused. For me, it would be great if it is possible so you can think carefully where you want a certain building to be placed or you just don’t want your nuggets to run while you use your powers to heal them or pick them up. It’s rather frustrating to chase them around a lot (especially when you want to heal them and your power missed. You just wasted some of your points on it and it’s all for nothing because your nugget was moving a lot.

In summary, The Universim is an endless god game where you do little to no micromanaging and just let your nuggets do their own thing. It is still in early access so as much as I recommend this game, it might be best to wait for a sale or just wait until it is nearly complete.

$ Price / Quality $ ↬ So the price for The Universim is a little pricey but if you are in to Strategy games then this is the game for you.



Overall the game is fantastic it does need A LOT of work. Sadly you can only get to the medievel stage of the game but as they update the game I can see so much potential in this game. I've followed this game since Kickstarter. And never doubt your self on buying a game just because it's Early Access. Give it a chance.

As they progress with the game I will try to edit my review.

[h1]What I like about the game:[/h1]
- The game has a distinct feel in artwork. Maybe a bit simplistic but it works.
- It reminds me of Black and White, without a monster pet.
- The seasonal changes do change the game and you need some planning for it.
- There is some micro managing going on. It mostly sticks to assiging a job to some one. 


[h1]What I dislike about The Universim:[/h1]
- There is not a lot in game yet. The tech tree stops about halfway. A lot of the later tech says 'coming soon' and some of those are desicion points making it that I would need to start over again if feel I made a wrong choice. 
- The tech tree itself is also... different. Sure you start in the stone age and already I am able to produce a water wheel before I can hunt. Sure that game mechanic related, but they do it again while you are stil supossed to be in the stone age. I can build a way to produce electricity in [i]the stone age[/i] and it is a requirement to advance toward the middle ages! Plus the tech tree feels very lineair. It doesn't give me a sense that I'm influencing an entire world. Maybe this will change with later updates.
- The pace of the game is sometimes a tad slow. But they added an accelerator! 2 clicks and.... not much. I'd like to be able to speed up the game some more. 
- There are some bugs. I haven't encountered game breaking ones but they took away some magic. They are things like an info button missing info and instead showing a bit of code. Pretty annoying if you want to know more.
- Scrolling around the world feels slow and almost becomes cumbersome.
- Acquiring new followers feels terribly cumbersome. You either gain them by using your godly powers, which need time to replenish (and might but most of the time won't give you a follower) or through quests. They appear early on several times and are getting scarces later on. I'd like to see and be able to acquire followers in groups. 
- The narrator can get annoying. After 2 or 3 times hearing him tell some event has happened I get it.

Maybe you played Black & White or some other indirect influence game, but these developers deserve a spot all to themselves. Let me explain.

The initial beginning is as plain as you would expect from the stone age although it quickly grows. While not overly complex in resources, they are the building blocks as all strategy have and the ""nuggets"" which you only start out with 2 quickly grow and die as the seasons themselves pass. Whether from disease, animals, nature disasters, or your own fault (i.e. hunger and water) these nuggets seem to appear and disappear at quite a rapid rate when I think of some other games that deal with age (Tropico 1- yes I know it is not a god game, but age does play a factor to a point). 

Recently I finally hit the end of the technological branch. After several attempts to grasp the economics and the overall scheme of things, I took this particular playthrough to the medieval age. Now from this playthrough I can say that the game itself has a pretty solid base in terms of starting out and growing. Granted I could not play any of the other ages just yet, what the developers have available to play is worth a few hours of play time to tinker with. These developers thus far have impressed me with their game, attention to the players, and overall ideas for the game. At the moment this is just a taste of what is to come and I believe they can definitely deliver. 

Long story short: The game is still in its early phases, what they have out is, for the most part, bug free and fun to play. Don't expect to shoot to the moon unless you are throwing rocks or shooting arrows at the moment.

To the Devs: Thank you guys for reviving a genre, then taking it a step further and giving it a style all on its own. You definitely impressed me and I wish I had looked up buying this game before it launched on steam (1. To support you and 2. for my name to be on that monument if I had to be honest Lol).

I figured it would have bugs and things taht still need tweaking. I enjoy this game non the less. I started out, probably like most, thinking hey this game is easy, look at how many nuggets I have. Well next thing I knew, they all started drinking from the lakes instead of the wells, learning now I need more than 3 (hahaha), and they all started getting poisoned, more than I could cure and nothing was getting built...my civilization was crumbling right before my eyes...then after 95% of my building had crumbled to nothing bust dust, I had only 3 nuggets left. One male and two females....I thought ok let them go and wait for the game to tell me I lost and start over....Well that didn't happen. With a little help from ""cupid"", the male left married the one female and out popped a baby nugget. Long story short, and probably a lot of incest ( we are not discussing that one), my population grew to over 150, my city rebuilt and expanded. It only made me want to play more.

I have to admit I was a little disappointed with it only being partially sent out. Not a very good move in my eyes but hey, you get what you get so I decided to give the game a try.

The game itself, you can tell needs some more polishing and you get only a bit of content for now. But the content I find is enough to get through and gives you an idea on what you'll need to do later on, as well as the problems you'll face. There is plenty to entertain yourself with. I for one feel excited at the idea of more to come. 

There are a lot of negative reviews, commenting on how the game is not complete and it should have been. Again, I too was disappointed that the full game has not been released, but I think this game is worth giving a chance. There is a lot of connections with the No Mans Sky incident where the game was not what it was meant to be. A review channel I favor even shredded it to pieces at the time of its launch. However, he went back to the game after it had been updated and found that the game was amazing. This shows that sometimes, just waiting a little bit can be the right course of action.

My recommendation? If you are like me, perhaps grab the game now and give it a try, if you are willing and able to throw a bit of money in. If you are not sure, do not just take my word for it, or the negative reviews. It's your choice, take it or leave it. Just let me say, perhaps keep your eyes on it and see where it leads.

Goods :-
Visually it's nice
Tech tree is pretty big for a early access
Voice overs are ok
Haven't encountered any noticeable bugs as yet

Bads (for me)
* Camera controls are awfull (slow and clunky at best)
* No world map so you have to find things manually
* No icons over any of the buildings or indication of what they are once built so unless you remember you'll be endlessly 
  clicking to find specific things
* Camera controls again lead to hard to find nuggets when they are out and about
* You have god powers but other then the ability to move resources the rest by the time you find the icon, click on it what 
  you needed it for is no longer an issue.
* No pause function
* atm it's more or less just build for the sake of building what you've just unlocked.
* no ability to build housing, they do that by themselves (maybe that unlocks later)
* Very few tool tips and no tutorial, so you are on your own as to what alot of things do.
* You only barely know what people want and how the logistics work for getting it to them, ie food, water etc.
* in my play through well before i could get to researching hunting a pack of wolves wiped out most of my nuggets

Overall after jsut a few hrs i am enjoying it still, it's a fun sandbox game in the style of populous without the abilty to manipulate the land and alot more god controls, i can see promise and who know's unlike many other early access games that the developers abandon, this may well surpass expectations, here's hoping :)",1536090970,1536090970,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm liking the narrator voice, and overall tone of the game. This game pulls in a lot of good ideas, but seems only design implemented around the initial map generation and heat/weather; initial looks of the planet are great, I'll be waiting for functionality. You can't really design anything, and neither can the nuggets. 

The population size can't get very big without performance issues, disasters tend to keep them pretty small miserable tribes with lots of empty buildings. Saving at any point still seems... broken. It's hard to know what they wanted to release here and where they are at now. Well at least I know what they fixed recently, and monthly releases can't hurt.

Relatively bug free for an early access in my opinion.  It's a little choppy once your civilization starts getting pretty big (Atleast with my specs:  Intel i5-7500 3.4ghz 4 core, 8 GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3 GB).  If you liked Black and White, this is similar but without goofy quests, or an annoying limit on the scope of where you hold influence, and far less buggy.

I think my only complaint, that I can reasonably level at it, is the frequency of natural disasters being a bit annoying.  Looking forward to seeing this continue, as the devs have grandiose plans.

If the Devs are watching, I've only encountered two bugs that I'm aware of.  Selecting a 'Kinetic Turbine' (the small one), and pressing escape to not place it, will open the options menu locking a ghost of the turbine placement stuck to the cursor.  You can still do everything normally, but the placer is in the way of seeing clearly.  Fixed by saving and reloading.

The only other bug I've noticed is the game taking a long time to acknowledge that it has saved a game.  I've noticed that it HAS saved the game, it just doesn't realize it and keeps a box saying for you to wait.  When I click off the box, I can see that the save game file was indeed created, but it took me a while to figure this out (I waited for an hour thinking the save was just taking forever, I really didn't want to lose my progress).

This is NOT a finished game. What I mean by this is that your world gets to the Medieval times and you cannot progress further than that. Mind you, there is still hours of gameplay to play up until that point; however, once you get to the end, there is no more progressing other than your population rising. 

There are a lot of things I love about this game. One being that it is very polished, especially for an alpha state. As mentioned in some of the comments, there are some minor bugs like a couple typos, but the art and mechanics are gorgeous. It is challenging in a sense where if you don't do certain things correctly or prepare for various scenrious, humanity is wiped. The game teases future assets to reasearch with ""Coming soon"" written on a lot of things - which is disapointing but makes me confident that they're using my money to actually move the game to a more finished state. I do think that the gam should be $15.00 as opposed to $30.00 in its current alpha state. There just isn't enough content to justify a $30.00 price tag.

--My nuggets (people) stopped moving and froze in place and died to hunger/dehydration. They appear to get stuck for reasons unclear. Sometimes picking them up and dropping them helps - sometimes not.
--On loading a save game I found all the plants in my world are devoid of fruit and herbs meaning I cannot learn them in my farms. They are not growing back. 
--The alarm button mentioned in various tool tips and web sources on the forcaster tower is missing. I built bunkers for my nuggets and they don't use them.

this game was everything I ever asked for when watching the trailers and waiting for its release... kinda. At first when playing I screwed up and killed my people because well going into it without context because it just got released is kinda hard. But once you get the hang of it, you understand why. For example, my population wasn't growing at 14 until I realised that I have to convince people to fall in love, kinda teaching them until they learned. Then I was so focased on my population that I didn't think i needed business, then all my people started going depressed waisting my god power, and on top of that I didn't know how to save and thought that the archive was useless, I was wrong. Alot of things for beginners screwed me up and I think that once you get new stuff, the narrorator should say what each thing does. But other than that I figured it out and finally got to the end of the game so far, loving every bit. One thing I am hoping is that this is not some quick cash grab promissing for the rest of the game because its in work, and never doing it. and two that they dont take alot of time for new content. but all in all, this is a fun game and would definatly recomend 10/10.",1535932132,1535932132,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

☑ Beginner
☑ Casual Gamer
☑ Normal Gamer
☐ Expert

The lack of a tutorial might confuse some people new to the genre, but if you give it a chance, you'll quickly find yourself getting into the swing of things. Strategy experts might find the limited amount of micromanagement to be off putting. 

☼ Graphics ☼
☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☐ Good 
☑ Beautiful
☐ Fantastic 

It's really charming and stylistic. Fun to look at. 

♬ Sound ♬
☐ Bad
☑ Alright
☐ Good 
☐ Beautiful
☐ Fantastic 

Sound is simplistic, but gets the job done. Some things (school bell for instance) are likely louder than they should be, but ultimately, it's alright sound design. 

☠ Difficulty ☠
☑ Easy 
☑ Average
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Hard
☐ Unfair

Verges on somewhere between an average and an easy difficulty for a game of this genre. Perhaps leaning more towards being easy, with very minimal micromanagement. 

§ Bugs §
☐ Bugs destroy the game
☑ Lots of bugs
☐ Few Bugs
☐ You can use them for speedrun
☐ Nothing encountered

This game is currently buggy. In my first 7 hours of gameplay, I ended up killing over half of my population because they all got trapped underground, eventually dying of thirst. I also encountered several performance issues that caused the game to stutter, primarily related to the autosave system. 

☯ Story ☯

You could perhaps say that life itself is the story here, but that'd be stretching things a bit. 

⚔ Gameplay ⚔
☐ Frustrating
☑ Sleepy / Relaxing
☐ Boring
☑ Fun
☑ Challenging

There are weird pacing issues throughout, where one moment you're fighting off wild animal attacks, and the next you're waiting 30 minutes for a new 'tech' to research. Depending on what's happening, you may go twenty whole minutes without much really going on, only for everything to seemingly start happening at once. 

۞ Game time / Length ۞
☑ Endless / No Length

While I marked this as being an endless game, because quite simply, there is no real ""end"". As of right now, you can basically see and do everything that this game has to offer within the first ten or so hours of playing, assuming you don't accidentally kill everyone during your first winter freeze. There's a ton of potential, but you may need to wait for several updates before your Nuggets can truly shine. 

$ Price / Quality $
☐ Full price 
☑ Wait for Sale 
☐ Don't buy
☐ Refund it if you can

This is an early access title, which means it's incomplete. Is it worth full price? Arguable, though I'd have to personally say no. While I definitely enjoyed my time playing The Universim, the fact that it's an early access title, and that it's so early along in its development cycle, warrants an air of caution. I'd either wait for a sale, or simply wait, period. As time goes on, this game is sure to become more of a complete experience. 

So, just wait. If you must buy it today, you're unlikely to be disappointed in your purchase. But I can't rate what doesn't yet exist, so purchase at your own risk.

That being said, I have a few issues. (Look at my play time to get an idea of how much time you are willing to devote to this game to justify it's purachase. )

Construction is slow and feedback/(things to do inbetween) is minimal. I'm a little over the ""click and wait 10 minutes"" style of gameplay. There are no major challenges during the initial phase. There is nothing during start/new game creation that is directing your attention to what buildings/research paths shoudl be chosen. It feels a little haphazard and ""just don't kill your people"" kinda vibe. Even in B&W there were theatrical moments where the narrator guided yout to make certain descisons. Here, it's just silence and building. Very, very slow building. 

Also, i don't see any mechanics that would limit your ""rule"". So the ""tornado"" or ""thunderstorm"" powers really feel out of place. If you are going to be a very callous, evil god there should at least be some justification to doing so. In B&W it helped fuel your overall god powers. But I'm not competing with anyone in this game, so it just feels empty and sociopathic to do anything but help (which is a good thing lol but overall as a god game seems shallow).

It is a really good core of a game, and I actually recommend it at the current price for this amount of playtime. 
Im a fan of the old populous games, as well as black and white. 

This game is a mix of a god game and a strategy game, you say what important buildings they should build like in a stragegy or management game, the civilians or ""Nuggets"" decide on their own where to build their houses. The amount of your believers, aka the people who give you the ""mana"" to do things are usually a portion of the total population. So you have to maintain your believers as well as making sure everyone is fine. Your mana grants you the ability you use your godly powers/aka spells that can both help or detract from your civilization and get you more followers( although the game can definetly improve the readability of which actions will help you get followers and how).
A lot of the resources are finite so you have to be careful about how you spend them. The humour in the game is ok, and its world view is sarcastic, some of that gets old after a while, but it is in line with its bullfrog/lionhead influences. 

The game currently only comes with the sort of sandbox mode, which is relatively easy, yet with some challenges that can wipe everyone out if your not careful. 

I really hope the developers continue to iterate on this, and they have to figure out how the game will play, it might make sense after they have added some mechanics, like more outside threats, to have a campaign with series of challenges + a sandbox mode, or perhaps they will stick with sandbox mode, although I do feel it would be nice to have at least some goals to tick in along the way. 

All in all its a pretty solid core, worth the money at this point, but if you want a complete experience its probably going to be worth the wait.

Notes: tech level accessable now is about early middle-ages, post 100 people it started to tax my cpu a bit, dropping the fps to around 30.
(CPU: intel i7 3820@4ghz OC).

The narrator is sassy, and funny, a great character. The graphics are relatively nice, the UI look good. You can expect the usual settlers/banished/tropico style of gathering resources with changing seasons. The economy is quite easy to understand.

However, I feel like it was a bit early to go for an early access.
- Saving won't work if you try to overwrite your previous save. It breaks the autosave function as well. So you have to start over again, or load your previous save after quitting the game.
- The economy is out of balance, some basic resources are drained super quickly, while others pile up. 
- You can't actually play until the level, it's advertised in the trailers.

Few examples of rough edges:
- At the beginning of the game you'll need to build a lot of water pumps, but with the upgrades during the game, they become so efficient that produce 3 times what you would actually need.
- Not sure why electricity is invented in the stone age
- Your people get injured while sleeping in their beds.
- Lot of spelling error, missing tooltips, confusing/inconsistent naming of items, building, technologies
- I don't really get what could I do to keep my number of followers
- There are missions, but there are only a couple of them, and some it seems impossible to do.

I've always been a fan of God Games in general, but I must say The Universim concentrates all the best aspects of this tipology. Without further ado I'll break down the main aspects of the game, obviously taking into account that it's still in Early Access.

[list]
    [*][h1]Graphics[/h1]
The Universim showcases one of the most interesting design I've ever seen. It's colourful, catchy and overall extremely nice to watch. The Nuggets are the cherry on top of the cake, with their non-expressive faces, tiny oval bodies running around at all times. I feel extremely satisfied and content during my playthroughs! The only downside is that being an Early Access release, sometimes a few graphic errors happen, but I'm sure these issues will be solved in the future. 

    [*][h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
An extremely nice and playful soundtrack will accompany you through the journey of your civilization. The voice of the sassy narrator will also let you crack a smile once in a while, despite resulting redundant and a bit frustrating after some time. Additionally, I really would like to hear an ominous OST sometimes during the playthrough, in the style of the first trailer.

    [*][h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Probably the weakest part at this point in time, since there is not much to do after a while. The pinnacle of evolution available at the moment is the pre-Medieval age. Moreover the current evolution tree is just a system based on time, with no regards to play style, except two or three techs: during the playthrough you'll probably unlock almost everything, without having to prefer some discovery over another. I have to say, however, that the game seems to be balanced in the first few hours of playthrough, and was overall satisfactory. I look forward new content in the future, since i see true pontential in this game

I can't wait so see the tech tree evolving, especially in the current late game, which, so it seems, was done in a bit of a hurry as requirements for tech are not so detailed as they are in the early game.

Also I would like to finally leave the planet and colonize other planets.

As for the gameplay itself, well, the micro management part surely got on my nerves. The message log is not interactive and one cannot click on the links presented there, sort of annoying as sometimes notifications will be put directly into the back log and you never find out where the source of that notification was.

For now, this game is of little replay value to me and I hope that the missing techs will be introduced soon.

Otherwise this is a very good piece of software, it makes very efficient use of procedural textures and whatnot and the overall design is just brilliant.

I thought from the pics and vids that the game was further along than it was, and didn't expect to only be getting an alpha release after this long.  But, I guess that was all just concepts and assets thrown together as a Kickstarter selling point.  While I'm disappointed that I'll have to wait even longer (likely a LOT longer) for the full game, the alpha version is a decent little appetizer for the main course.

While this version is FAR from complete and nowhere near bug free, it does a good job of showing you what the game is all about and providing a good idea about the nature of the gameplay.  I CANNOT recommend this game to anyone looking for or expecting a completed, working title - this is an ALPHA build!  Just like with any incomplete game, you run the risk of the game never being finished and being out whatever you paid for it.  However, if you love the concept of this game enough that you're reading the reviews for its alpha build, then I can only assume that, like me, you are willing to take that risk in hopes of one day soon(ish) getting to play the finished build.  For you, I recommend getting in early and buying it now.  I enjoy the roughness of this build, and the lack of hand-holding forces you to learn how to play, largely through trial and error.  Just know that if you do pounce on this version, you probably won't get a whole lot of gameplay time out of your money before you've done everything there is to do.

Here's a rundown of my first playthrough.  The first and largest disaster to befall my tiny little civ was the first wolf attack. 
They just came from nowhere and we were not prepared in the least.  Half or more of all my nuggets were dead.  Everyone was horribly depressed and suicidal.  There weren't enough nuggets left to work at all the worksites and I think most if not all the previously existing breeding couples were broken, by way of at least one member being wolf kibble.  I was almost certain that my little civ was doomed and that I would have to start again anew.  But we endured.  I pulled nuggets away from all tasks that weren't directly associated with our direct survival so I could have people building and working the vital stuff.  I used the last of my faith powers to hook up as many new couples as I could so the population could recover.  Then once I had more faith, I used my powers to cheer up the saddest nuggets.  Before long, we had rebounded.  From then on, no other disaster brought my little civ down so drastically.  We endured, and made it as far into the future as is currently possible in the game right now.  On this single playthrough it took less than seven hours to research all the tech currently available.  I have a civ well over a hundred nuggets, with wind turbines supplying electricity to their newly built Tudor-style homes.  The biggest hurdle right now is the dwindling of what should be renewable resources - mainly water and trees.

So, here's a list of issues that I currently have with the game in its current state.  I don't know how much of this reflects how they intend the final form of the game to be, but I feel that they need addressing, if only to represent a few buy/avoid points for anyone still undecided about buying the game as is.

1:  Scale of the water system - The scale of the game itself is fine; I have no issues with a tiny little planet to fully wrap my little civ around.  However, when I have to build half a dozen or more water wheels and even more reservoirs just to have enough water for a village with such a seemingly small population, that's when I have an issue.  Especially when every body of water - though unchanging visibly - has a finite amount of water (and fish btw) that can be pulled from it.  Yes, you can replenish the reservoirs in winter with the rain power, but my point is that you shouldn't need such a HUGE supply chain for such a small pop, especially since it is so out of whack compared with everything else.  I drained an entire lake with only three water wheels to supply my pop, even while running wheels on multiple other lakes as well.  Please, scale back the amount of infrastructure required to keep the pop watered.

2:  Forest Conservation - Every building needs trees, but the trees don't regrow.  So civilization keeps marching ever outward clearcutting every tree in the land.  I build a lumberjack hut in the middle of a nice forest, and before I knew it, that forest was gone and the lumberjacks had nothing to do.  It seems like one of the unimplimented tech in the medieval era deals with conservation, but that does no good now.  Yes, it's an incomplete alpha build not meant to be played long-term, but it's an issue none-the-less.  At the very least let lumberjack huts replant trees as they cut them, as is common in pretty much every other game that has lumberjack huts in the whole world.

3:  Time Scale - Really?  We're building a working electrical grid in the medieval era?  Just as my people are converting from little stone huts to actual houses, we need electricity?  I don't know it this was simply a case of game concepts being thrown in for testing purposes outside of their ultimately-intended eras or if this is by design, but I don't like it.  The need and supply of electricity feels WAY too out-of-place for where and when it's being implemented right now.  It almost feels like jumping straight out of the stone-age into the industrial revolution with nothing in-between.

4:  Defense - Just a minor issue here, but still a concern.  These cave nuggets should at least be able to arm themselves with sticks and stones to try and defend themselves if attacked by a wild animal.  These are supposed to be hunter-gatherers after all, and it doesn't make sense for every single one of them to be a cowardly little tart running and screaming away from predators.  Nuggets should have another recourse in the absence of guard towers, since there's plenty of time to get eaten before those are researched and built.

That's it.  If you like the sound of this game and want to try it out early, go on and buy it.  The devolpers likely need the influx of cash after working on the game for so long, and getting involved early is likely a great way to help influence the game's future development by letting them know what does and doesn't work.  If you're only looking for finished titles you're in the wrong place.  I'm quite optimistic about the game's potential and look forward to being a part of the journey.",1535802845,1535802845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game is weird but in a great way, it is very different from a lot of other games that i've played and unique. It doesn't give you complete control over everything but gives you control over the big things. It feels less like a city micro management game and more like a civilization management game. At the start you do a lot of the hard work but as the game progresses, you start doing less and less. You play as the Creator for the Mother Planet which has a race of nuggets which you will aid. Now instead of telling them to go build a bunch of houses and things like that, you are given a selection of powers which you can use as long as you have enough creator points. Two of the imortant powers you start with is one that allows you to move objects around which can be used for various things, and one that allows you to make nuggets fall in love and make baby nuggets. Once two nuggets are engaged, they build a house, then their children do it, then their children do it, etc. The game then from there is about keeping your slowly growing civilization of nuggets alive and well, you do this by doing research which allows you to build new things for your  nuggets. And the game keeps going from there, not gonna write out the entire game.

Now i have gotten to a point where a lot of the things i research are either upgrades or things that say ""coming soon"", so im assuming i've pretty much hit the end of everything this version has to offer. I might be wrong because there is another mode i have yet to try and i haven't gotten everything yet either. Im also not a huge fan of the gap between having rock houses to making these gas mines but im guessing that it'll be changed in a newer version.

Lastly, the performance, at least for me at late game, is really stuttery. There are also some performance issues and stuttering when opening things like the archieve and it is a bit annoying, i did get around this though because the game is addicting and it isn't too big of a deal. There are also a couple of glitches with the nugget ai and im not 100% on if the bunkers work right because no one goes in them yet they are safe from the storms and such, but that's probably going to be fixed in a later version.

-It feels like it was designed for the Mobile with even the opening (unskippable) cinematic encouraging you to touch the screen (instead of click). Combined with real life timers that are not quite long enough to see a monatization scheme hidden inside, and yet long enough to be obnoxious especially on subsequent play throughs.  
-The game moves at a snails pace as you are constantly waiting for evolution to tick by, or nuggets to eventually get around to reproducing giving you more workers, or your creator powers to charge.  
-The game is not well optimized.  Because you have so little control over your nuggets, you can feel a little choked in the beginning of the game waiting for them to hurry up and get to making with the more nuggets.  However as you approach the mid game and start to break 30-60 nuggets (my) machine took a noticable hit.  It is not a top of the lower supercoputer but can run Monster Hunter World on high settings without an issue.  However opening the archive (save system) causes noticable freezes as well.  This should be ironed out later, but for now it makes it almost impossible for me to continue the game.
-The direction of the game is stuck in this in between of a casual mobile game where you can just kind of ignore it while listening to music or watching Netflix, and a more hands on god game like Black & White.  However you can't ignore your nuggets as they will walk into areas where they get stuck and then die, then the mortician will walk in there to go get the corpse and die, and then another nugget will go in to get the resources the first one was carrying and then die.  Nor is it as hands on as Black & White as you are limited to only being able to pick up 1 nugget at a time, and when setting them down you have to be zoomed all the way in and very carefully set them down or they explode like a gremlin in the microwave.  

Some of these can be fixed as it comes out of early access, some are actual design choices that for me are not appealing.  In fact I am listed as having 22 hours of playtime, of that I wouldn't expect that more then 2-4 hours were spent paying any real attention to the game.  You are encouraged to keep a very hands off approach in such that if you spend too much god power trying to help the little nuggets you may find you have none to deal with an actual disaster.  

Speaking of which I didn't include the disasters as a con because I am (generously) considering it a balance issue to be worked out later,  but as of now it really is a sh!tshow where you just sit back and watch a pack of wolves walk in your town and massacre your nuggets with nothing you can do about it.  Or a tornado come from the other side of the planet and just cut right through your town every single year.  This can very easily lead to death waves which leads to depressed nuggets who stop functioning and dying.  Took me two playthroughs to learn you have to make a b-line to the recreation evolution to stop the depression wave.  Again I expect this to be sorted out in a blance patch eventually.

+Pros : If you've read this far into a negative review maybe you're looking for a reason to actually like the game.  And there are a few.
+Styalized graphics.  The graphics have a simplistic look to them, but imo this saves the game as you don't run the risk of your game looking outdated even before it launches, or worse yet the graphics contributing to the poor optimization of trying to render and compute 10's (theoretically 100's) of nuggets is hi def.
+Captures the nostalgia of a god game that I used to really enjoy and haven't found done well in a very long time.  
+Idea.  This one is a mixed bag as I haven't gotten to the end game yet, but idea of it is really intriguing.  I enjoyed the space aspect of Spore, and this offers a similar end game which does intrigue me.  I am concerned to see how it will be optimized to run, but the idea of it in my opinion sounds fun.
+Price for what it is, it is priced fairly and includes the entire game with no lootboxes or microtransactions or buried denuvo DRM.  Which isn't as common as it should be in imo is a positive.",1535755292,1535755292,False,1,0,0.481481492519378662,0,True,False,True

It would be easier if there was a list of select mates and would help to avoid splitting up families or matching someone incompatible for procreation. I keep getting to a point where the old die out faster than babies are born due to the AI lacking in matching up mating pairs. The cemetary undertaker really needs to be more effective because by the time the old start knocking off there are so many dead bodies everywhere that I had to use up all my god powers to move them. The seasons change way too quickly as well. This game has some work to do but if they keep it up the game will be great.

Saving became a challenge right before I started researching electricity.  I finally determined the only way I could save at that point was to only research one item at a time.

The strangest utilization of the research tree concept ..its possible that it was just sorta tossed out there with no real consideration for the historical, or even logical, development of technology..You don't seem to have much control over population growth either, basicially I had to destroy houses in order to keep them from spawning all over the map once the Tudor research was completed.

1. Animals get frozen up for some weird reason please look into that.
2. Can you please add a function where we know what the nuggets are corrently working on like adding a little tab telling us what they are currently working on and whats on hold for an upgrade.
3. Is their going to be a feature where trees and water, and animals regenerate over time. For Exam: Animals bread to Repopulate what we have hunted. Trees grow back so my nuggets don't have to travel miles and miles just to cut down a couple of trees for an upgrade. Water refills over time when it rains on the lakes and ponds because as of now once they are dried up thats it! I don't know about you guys if know but this nuggets will drink a tiny pond which contains 3,000,000 amounts of water in a couple of days once your populations goes up beyond 100+.

This is going to sound BRUTALLY honest, but bare with me.
So where to start? Well how about whats good with the game:

The Pros:

The Graphics make this tiny planet and all the little nuggets look AMAZING. Best looking god game in a very long time.

The Detail is extensive. Of course in most god games, its nice to see attention on detail. There is no lack here.
(im going to get hate for this next one)

The Nuggets are my favorite part about this game. They literally do everything wrong and I cant help but think ""Oh bless them, they got stuck in crocodile infested waters... again.""

Now for the real list...

The Cons:

OH MY GOD THE FUCKING AI. Who made the nuggets? WHO? come forward and admit your crimes!
They dont do anything. They are the most stupid AI i have ever seen in any game. Ive played Civ!!!! You have to hand hold them with literally everything. LITERALLY EVERYTHING. There is NO autonomy at ALL.

The progression is a snails pace. I watched others play this just to make sure i wasnt being stupid... i wasnt.
Its just that bad. It takes FOREVER to research things, up to IRL hours, yes you fucking heard me.

The graphics are also a HUGE negative. Reason being? They clearly dont care about the actual rest of their game. If you make a game look pretty, and dont put ANY OTHER content into it, youre scamming people. You are putting a pretty bow on a pile of steaming hot garbage. I would rather this game look like it was from 1990 instead of 2018 because then this level of discrepency would make sense. But its not. This game is broken as fuck. I understand this is meant to be an alpha... but can you not see its a scam? Which brings me to the biggest and most damning feature...


THIS ""GAME"" IS THIRTY FUCKING DOLLARS?!?!?!?!
MOTHER FUCKERS ARE YOU ON CRACK?!
I get that youre a small team with big hopes and dreams, but holy shit please reaccess the value of what you put into this game so far.
Youre in a brand new alpha, with barely any steam (heh) behind it... and youre demanding $30 to play the earliest version of your software?! Fucking MINECRAFT was free the day it released in alpha until it went into beta. And even then it was only $20. That might seem like not a big difference, but that was basically a finished product at that point, this is no where NEAR that level.
Id pay maybe $5 TOPS for this at its current state, not 30, or 25 as its on sale. If you fixed all of your bugs and had a competant AI system then yes it would be closer to that price, probably 15... but not $30!

As it stands right now, i will not be recommending this so obvious cash grab, until it has done some SERIOUS overhauling to its features, and reduced that price SIGNIFICANTLY.",1535647957,1535647957,False,7,0,0.452863872051239014,3,True,False,True

First off, it's beautiful.  Animations are bugged or incomplete, but the landscape is vibrant and the painted/tattooed animals contrast the natural terrain.  If the intro is to be believed, there will be a great variety of terrains and animals coming in the space age (though that doesn't exist yet).
The research tree is sensible, if not a bit too linear, and provides reasonable customization of your path forward.  The concept is tried and true, build a populous to build your city to build your populous ..., and keep the populous happy.

Now the bad.  
Pacing:  It is painfully slow.  The first 10/15 minutes when you're grappling with the controls and interfaces are entertaining when played at max speed.  Max speed as compared to normal speed is similar to comparing turtle to snail.  It's way too slow.  God power trickles in so the player has minimal control over the day-to-day lives of the people.  Player controls where central buildings are placed (think sim city utility buildins and education), but cannot control where huts are placed.   There's no indication of how often water and food sources are required or what area they can supply, leading to a town with stockpiles of each and yet majority of population dies of thirst.  

Pacing Again:  Research is quick initially.  You que up some early technology and in a few minutes you can build it.  Then it slows dramatically.  Want a water pit?  That's about 30sec.  Want a slightly deeper water pit?  That'll be 5 minutes.  Research obviously throttles how quickly the game progresses, and may be used as a stopper here since the game is woefully incomplete, but that was painful.  Intuitively, one might assume (civilization/stellaris) that a more intelligent population would improve research times.  No.  Adding schools trained students to be teachers to train students faster to... nothing.  There was no significant difference between a school person and one left alone.  They still fell and hurt themselves, drank from lakes and got sick, and work speed seemed unaffected.  

Autonomy (or lack there of):  The intro makes it very clear.  You are god and it is up to you to help guide the populous into a thriving culture.  The people place their huts autonomously (which can be frustrating at times).  This needs to be expanded greatly.  Research the water technologies and then let the system take over placing them.  Sure, allow the player to build things, and let that player interaction pace the autonomous queue.  Divine intervention for engineers.  But having to police every minute detail of the populous is simply tedious.  If they build their huts too far from the clean water source, then they should also have the programming to build a new water source.  Buildings are degrading too quickly, queue up another engineer.  There are wolves in the town?  How about you queue a watchtower.  

Finally the information overlay, or lack there of.  As a civilization builder game, information overlay is everything.  I continuously harp on it, but how far will the people travel for water?  How far for food?  If I'm assigning people to workstations, show me a path from their house so I know who's closest.  Or better yet, give me the option to autoassign workers to new buildings based on some criteria like distance or education level.

Final recommendation:  Thumbs up but don't purchase yet.  This is a rare middle ground for me.  The devs will (supposedly) be taking the game into the space age, and pacing is a matter of balancing values.  I hope they implement greater autonomy as well so micro managing can shift to macro during the space age.  But while the future is bright, this is pretty damn boring for a ($26.99) game.  I'll be shelving it for probably the next 6 months.",1535513634,1535641302,True,1,0,0.522490084171295166,0,True,False,True

If you're looking for a polished, full-length game, this is not it. That being said, I think it is worth the ticket price and I am optimistic about what this game will become.

I am enjoying this game tremendously. Granted, I have not been following Universim since its inception and that probably helped, because I didn't have high expectations that weren't met. I bought this game because I enjoy god games and management games like banished, civ, simcity, spore, etc. The game currently goes until early medieval period, although I haven't actually made it there myself, yet. I was getting close yesterday, but then a tornado hit my city at the same time as a pack of wolves came through and the whole thing happened right as winter was about to start. Two thirds of my population died and without people left to run my buildings, we've been struggling to get by. (But we aren't destroyed yet!) 

The graphics are charming, the music is pleasant, and the narrator is enjoyably snarky. The game moves slow and I like that. So, even though there aren't modern or space stages yet, there is enough to invest a good amount of time into. Some things don't always work, but early access is to test bugs, after all. The biggest issue I've heard of so far is that saves can be corrupted, which is a big problem but I haven't experienced it yet because I'm a serial re-starter. I've started about six times so far and I'm not getting bored yet. (I do wish the intro was skip-able though as it is a bit long.)

The game is decently difficult. Just when you think you've got everything under control, it turns out you should have researched watch-towers (because your people get attacked by a pack of wolves) or bunkers (because a tornado whips through your city.) Earning followers is also not super easy. Even when they've suffered the aformentioned tragedies and you go and skip Winter for them to alleviate their struggles, they're just sort of surprised. These are some skeptical cave-people. 

Anyway, if you're looking for a game that lets you take a civilization from cavemen to space, give this game a few more years before you buy it.

It's an interesting game without a lot of depth. It's more of a simulation than a true city or civ building game like Skylines. I agree with many of the negative reviews' assessments of the bloated tech tree, pacing, and bugs.

Visually it's great. I like the art style and the view of the whole planet. The intro sequence is cool. Good voice acting by the narrator. But there are some issues that overshadow that.

First, the upgrade system is broken. In the time it took me to write my review, maybe about 15 minutes, I left the game running in the background with a few building upgrades queued up, more than enough resources, and no other new buildings queued for creation. When I checked back, my laborers are still collecting resources and dropping them off at depots while the queued upgrades still haven't received the resources required to upgrade.

A big issue I have that I haven't seen addressed in the reviews revolves around a core mechanic of the gameplay - the God Powers - and that they don't add much to the game and are broken.

First, I'll explain how they work. You have an array of powers available to you that let you move resources to buildings, heal pops, increase the happiness of pops, make two pops fall in love and reproduce, send natural disasters, etc. You use a currency to spend on these powers. The rate at which you gain this currency depends on the number of people that believe in you vs your total population. If a higher percentage of your population believes you exist, you gain them faster. You convert people by performing these powers like healing an injured person, or delivering resources to a building that is under construction.

In my experience, the only useful one is Telekenesis, which I used so I could create buildings faster in the early game and deliver seeds to farms in the mid game. Outside of some quests early on in the game, I never use Happiness Boost / Healing once I have the right infrastructure in place, and the pops do a good job of finding a partner on their own so it isn't worth spending 20 points on Matchmaking. 

On top of that, it's pretty hard to convince your pops you exist. You might spend 10 points to heal someone's broken leg, and they won't become a believer. Or you'll spend 20 points moving two trees and two rocks to build a new water pump, and the builders won't convert after seeing you hand deliver these resources to them. You can even summon a raincloud for 40 points over a busy part of your village, and you might convert only one pop.

So I end up saving all my points and spending 60 points at the end of every Fall to jump the season ahead to Spring, effectively skipping Winter, because Winter actually has an impact on my water and food production. That's kind of broken I think. On my current playthrough, I only have 14 believers out of 53 total pops.

There's some smaller issues too.

Tornados are natural disasters, and there are bunkers you can build for your pops to hide in so you don't lose 20% of your village's population. The Universim's website says Forecast Towers have a button which you can press to alert pops to go hide in the bunkers, but there isn't a button on the Forecast Tower info panel when you click on it. The towers automatically sound an alarm when a tornado is near, which is a foghorn that goes off for a few minutes until the tornado disappears (which is annoying on its own), but the villagers don't react and go to a bunker.

What's the deal with building an Archives to enable saving? Doesn't make any sense to me as a game feature. Just autosave regularly like every other game. No need to reinvent the wheel here. This feature isn't revolutionary, it's annoying. You have to build an Archives building to be able to save a game, and you need to staff it with a pop to enable autosave. Not to mention autosave freezes the game up and hides the UI for a few seconds whenever it happens.

The Temple building, which should be a pretty important building for a game like this, doesn't have an info panel when you click on it. If you click on the building, nothing pops up - no stats, no durability meter for the building. Seems like that is a wasted opportunity to interact with the religion of your pops.

Personal gripe, but I really don't like the cynical nature of some of the news alerts. The writer must have a pretty negative view on kids and marriage.

The recipe- Take a large slice of black and white (carefully removing any pet residue) - Add dash of populas 2  and a pinch of age of empires and serve it up...

This looks a promising title but as it stands now it is pretty much half the game it's going to be.  In it's present state it's fun - but it certainly is Early access... It ran well - no major issues to report. However, a number of the games research features are listed as 'COMING SOON' so as it stands you can only progress to the medievil era and you're pretty much done.. 
The opening to the game i particularly liked- I won't spoil it in this review- Utube can do that for you much better...

So my recommendations..... 

It's Worth an 'early access look' if you have the cash to spare and the curiocity to try it - like i said, i had fun. But i seriously would not recommend it to anybody looking for a polished completly playable game -that just isnt what Early access is.

Overall I would say this game has a lot of potential! As long as the developers pay attention to the community I believe this game will do well.

The current version of the game has several noteable bugs: The camera will randomly spin around and face the sky, the in-game notifications about the wellbeing of your nuggets tends to get stuck and some reports won't go away, and there is currently no way to make depressed people happy other than through the use of the influence god-power (The last bit isn't really a bug, just something that I noticed).

I would say with the game the way it is, there is at least a few hours worth of content and the developer has noted that they will be doing monthly updates, which would be a good pacing for new content in my opinion. I love the stylized look as well as the concept. And I am quite impressed with what I see so far!

I have two issues that are causing play to be frustrating: dead bodies make nuggets sad but cemeteries also make nuggets sad. I don't think the cemeteries should make them sad otherwise there's no real reason to build them. As far as I can tell cemeteries make nuggets less sad, but that information is hard to discern for sure.

I'm a big fan of all the god game genres (I've played a lot Populous, Populous: The beginning, Black & White, Godus (unfortunately) etc...) and I have a lot of expectations for the Universim's coming updates.

The game in the actual state, even if is not completed yet and is not graphically optimized, is playable and have a LOT of potential (the idea is very original).

The price however is a little bit high for the actual state of development, but I've buyed it because I want to contribute to develop of this kind of games. So if you are a god game lover, I suggest you to do the same.

However from the same prospective I'm very worried, because I had some time ago the same hopes and expectations for another title of similar type: ""Godus"". And we all saw what happened next...

I hope this will not be the case, and hopefully it will continue to grow to reach perfection and for this reason a give a thumb up :)

SUGGESTIONS: Here a list of things that in my opinion should be developped more in the future:
- Have the possibility to terraform a barren planet and prepare it for life (like in Spore)
- Have also the possibility to destroy all always via terraform and restart again on the same planet (like in spore)
- Reach the space age (I know this is already in program by the developpers)
- How about colonize other planets? (Yes this maybe is a little bit ambitious)

At the end I will list the PROS and CONS.

PROS:
- Very innovative and have a lot of potential
- Graphics and animations well designed
- Random planet generation at every start
- Possibility to have ""Creator Mode"" gameplay, unlocked after medieval age

CONS:
- Graphics need to be optimized more
- Research time are too long, there is the need of a building to reduce the research times
- In general the game should be more dynamic, I've spent about 2 hours to barely reach the early stages of medieval age.

IN THE END: A very promising game with a lot of potential and with all the elements to become a GREAT game.

UPDATE: After I've played about 8 hours and after have read the history regarding the development of this game (4 YEARS!!!) I'm really unimpressed and I have fear that this game have a lot of potential to become a failure like Godus.

Also, the god powers are only very basic at the moment and using them seems to only randomly inspire your citizens with awe (thats how you gain 'believers' which give you more power).

In my opinion, early access means that the content is not complete or can change, however, it shouldn't mean, that it has a lot of bugs. Yeah, some minor bugs are okay, but there shouldn't be any game-breaking bugs.

For example, the save mechanism. I saved my game multiple times, but when I loaded my game it was on a much earlier state than my last save. In addition to that, the game freezes for a few seconds while saving.

Another issue is speeding up the game speed. It doesn't feel like speeding up, yes, it's faster, but pressing the forward button twice should make the game a lot faster than it is now.

Some UI Elements have a tooltip that explain what they're for, most don't have this and you're wondering what the elements are for. 

Game tells you to use ""Leviatate"" god power, however no such god power exists. Instead you need to use the ""Telekinesis"" god power, which I had to found  out by googling.

Sometimes you press certain UI elements and they don't register a click, for example trying to close a window with building information.

Also, the god power to skip a season is too overpowered. Doesn't cost enough and can be used to skip every winter.

I wouldn't recommend this game in it's current state, however, I think that it can turn this around. I will wait 2 weeks for the coming patches, and see if they fixed some of the issues I see with the game. If they do, I'll def. change my recommendation to ""Yes"" and not refund this, otherwise, I just don't see the value in buying it right now.

It was very long in development before getting into EA, so I think we deserve some bug fixes and QoL changes.

Unfortunately the description is a bit misleading: promising a ""God-game"", while your God-actions are limited. (no way to properly regulate population, housebuilding, resource-harvesting, etc).
And the occasional tasks... As a little example: looking for a child via scrolling through the map is also pretty weird as God. I don't have power to see where the souls are on the planet? Or the housebuilder will only believe in me once I shipped enough tree/stone?

Also, apparently a functioning settlement doesn't seem to need any gods (eg doctors will heal instead of you), so you'll just simply lose followers - and your inventory is limited to do anything about it.
Oh, and on top of everything: once you have a village with 3-4 houses (~30 min?), well, it gets boring.

+nuggets create mud-paths as they move. Real nice little attition.
+God powers enable micromanagment, however most don't seem neccssery. The God powers are also a really nice little flavour to make you really feel just that much more powerful and a *relatively* unique way to bring extra interactivity.
+Friendly and cartoony graphics and art style. ""Realistic"" graphics can look nice, however age faster. I'm personally a fan of cartoony styles.
+Humour. The ""Heauge Mahscles"" tech allows your nuggets to appriciate the benefits of ""getting SWOL""
+Generally charming. I was put off by the introductory cinematic's seeming lack of anti-aliasing at first, but after that everything has drawn me in (and the game has anti-aliasing). 
+Natural Disasters add challenge, spice things up and change the pace.

+/- Minigames/side quests. Some are fun, some no so much. EG: One has you rescue a child with your god power, another has you bring trees and stones to build a hut.
+/- You need to build a hut before you can save and you can only save which someone is working in it. This is a nice flavour addition that I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy, but for me it's just a matter of putting in a labourer, saving, then dropping them out. Kinda annoying. Maybe if there's nobody working it, you can only save once every 10-15 minutes instead?

-Some tooltip text is bugged, making it unreadable (no biggie, it's EA and will be fixed).
-You require an engineers hut to maintain things (without god powers), however there's no way to see how far the radius is without clicking on it and then remembering (bit annoying).
-laggy when in save menu. It's EA though.
-Hovering over a nugget from their home seems to be a bit buggy atm. the tooltip only flashes before dissapearing.

If you're a fan of city builders (survivng mars, banished) or even survival sims like Rimworld thenthis is definitely worth a go.

Bugs galore: i.e., when rescuing lil nugget quest, the planet just kept spinning around and around. Home button wouldn't work, wasd didn't work. Just kept spinning. Dropped the poor little nugget to his death, and still kept spinning.

Also, there needs to be a better tutorial. The tips were helpful, but I was constantly googling to try and figure out some things. For instance, reservoirs are supposed to store excess water for when water wheels freeze up, but the reservoirs freeze as well?! Couldn't figure out what to do about that situation.

TLDR: Show’s promise but as others have mentioned should be a lot further along in its development than it is. I recommend a wait and see approach.


The Universim is a very promising title with great art work and music.  The story – you produce the big bang and then guide a civilization through the ages.   It seems that the planet “Mother” of the civilization is set up to be its own character and dishes out harmful natural events.  In a sense the plant is your opponent.   

There are bugs, oh boy are there bugs…  This would be acceptable if the game was truly a first release ALPHA.  Sadly, this is not the case.  This game has been available for some time at the publisher’s webstore.  Additionally, the bugs are ones that should have been quickly sorted out on that end such as FIND_HEADER_TEXT% as an example on pop ups or mouse overs.  Nuggets getting stuck in ground due to poor Z axis programing.  Spelling and grammatical errors (while im not a English major, I am also not selling a story).  

There are a lot of positives to the game but sadly the negatives outweigh the positives.

Pro’s:
Graphics
Sound
Relative freedom in context to the stories goals

Negative’s:
You do not feel powerful
Nugget AI is horrendously bad
If you fail a mission, there is no real consequence
Even saving the game lag’s and ties up a nugget that is vital to early game
The narrator pokes fun at how weak you are as a god.
Asset errors in pop up’s/mouseovers
Very long time in development before STEAM EA

Conclusion:

While I remain hopeful that the developers sort out the issues with the game during the EA period; I, would recommend caution.  Give the game some time to see how well the developer rolls out updates and bug fixes.  The current iteration is just not worth the price tag.  If your looking for a black & white this game will not live up to those expectations with its current design model and puny god powers.

This is a surprisingly lovely game. You are immediately whisked into a lovely opening sequence, which demonstrates the high quality the devs are aiming for with the final outcome of the game. Its tranquil, and the narration is spot on, and very in keeping with the tone of the game.
The gameplay itself is very smooth, I have only encountered a single bug thus far, and that was a mere scramble of letters where a tooltip box was, i would assume, supposed to be. The graphics are lovely, very pretty indeed, without being childishly cartoon like, and the nuggets are simply adorable.
 
However, as this is a VERY early access build, there are obviously some things which are not currently implimented in game, but are shown as ""coming soon"". I can more than live with this, as you expect these kinds of things in Alpha/Beta builds.
I would only suggest there be a slight extention on the ""tutorial"" at the start, which only really introduces the nuggets to you, and then you're pretty much left to fend for yourself. Again, not a major game breaker, but, something which meant I ended up restarting an hour or so in, when some mechanics became more apparent to me. 

Overall, I am highly impressed with The Universim so far, and I am thoroughly enjoying playing it. This games has scores of potential, and I am very excited to see where the devs take it in the future.

I have been playing this game for almost 10 hours now and i find the concept generally original and fun. There are serious hickups though.
The lack of information about the basics of the game is frustrating since there is real potential and the feeling of progress is amazing watching your civ get bigger. 
The game lets you explore the mechanics on your own, however you will face critical problems such as extreme unhapiness and suicidal nuggets, with no guide as to how to solve main issues. Nowhere in the information tab can you read or figure out how to make them happier and the information there provided on buildings and mechanics of nuggets are terrible. You basically have to rush recreation for your nuggets not to be unhappy due to the -1 33 second standard decay that is very odd and nowhere near fair not telling a new player, how to resolve with a simple monolouge by the narrator. At the beginging of the game it should explain the nuggets mechanics aswell as a short summary of what a new building provides when researched. Aswell as tips to issues when the player faces them. 
Game will be worth the price if these main issues are looked at, until then its not worth the price since its almost impossible making it further than early midgame without bugs or lack of information ruining your game.

Bugs: Saving your game in the archive is laggy. always. freezeframes. yuck. And a lot of times your nuggets will just freeze forever for no apparent reason even after reloading the save(which several times bugs, so you are unable to save) or picking the nuggets up and placing them again, they freeze within minutes just standing still.

I appreciate what they are trying to do in terms of that Black and White feel, it just lacks any cohesiveness and depth that made Black and White and similar god games a thing. Quests have no direction and lack real reward, there aren't any descriptions of how some buildings come into play and their effects on others, there are no base level statistics referenced from getting ""+1"" in the tech tree from, only main buildings require to assign a nugget but then things that are falling apart get no attention from nuggets even if you want to assign them to something, particle interaction when trying to collect resources and deposit them elsewhere is abysmal, moving the global map while trying to do a god interaction is almost impossible, and there's no real impending doom/virtue feeling of if I do something specific that it will impact my populace and how they interact with me and the rest of the world.
Things that I think they should have been able to implement by now after all this while that leaves this lacking: no help in explaining how to start, build, upkeep and supply a chain that is necessary for keeping things running; direction of quests and using them advance other narratives (as it stands there are no penalties and no real rewards for anything, and no direction in finding quests a lot of times), interactions between nuggets is hard to discern unless you specifically make them do something and it is hard enough to try and make them do anything. 

Also, I do like the aspect of making a building to save your legacy(be able to save your game), but if that building does nothing other than that then it's a waste of resources, time, and space.

First, there are (obviously) bugs that hurt game progression: one of them I encountered was stopped disaster timer; on top of that, everyone lese seemed frozen and even sunk underground :( Moreover, there are a lot of missing text that hinders people's understanding of game mechanics (for example, little info on how happiness works and no text explaining what certains icons and numbers mean. It can be learned but takes unneccesary amount of time), and random event seems useless as there are no gift at the time of early release. 

Although I am positive that all these can be fixed, the real issue (or potential issue) lies in endgame. I am happy to control 100-200 people, but how about 20 times the people?  It might be too complicated to do mircomanagement and it needs to have higher AI in late game. Afterall, I want to play the GOD, NOT the Nanny.  Furthermore,  as mentioned by others, what we are going to do after all researches done? Remember how Spores is boring at the end when you just wander around the Galaxy and your countryman calls you back for almost everything thats supposed to handle themselves.

If you like ""god games"", this definitly might be something for you. 

Positive aspects:

- As mentioned, the game definitly got a lot of love from the developers. Funny comments from a ""narrator"" through the game, interesting and hillarious descriptions and loading screen ""hints"" (""Do not pet dogs while they're on fire"" or ""press ALT+F4 to learn more about the developers amazing sense of humour"") clearly show you, that the developers put a lot of effort in this game.

- Nice graphics for an early access title, with creative features (like the camera ""cracking"" at rocks if you go too close)

- Relaxing atmosphere, the game speed is relatively slow, which allows you to lean back, watch your ""Nuggets"" and laugh at their misery, like the (probably) kind deity you are. 

- Good price, in my opinion 25€ (or whatever your currency might be) is definitly justified for the amount of content this game provides. (especially if the future content the developers promised is really included.)

Negative aspects:

- Sometimes a bit difficult to control, especially the telecinetic ability killed a lot of Nuggets and required me to reload a lot, before managing to drop him with acceptable amounts of pain. 

- Talking about ""reloading"" - the only way to save the game is by construction a building for that purpose. If this building gets destroyed, you cannot save the game anymore. Interesting system, I personally like saving in the menu a bit more.

The game has a unique and beatiful look. It has some mechanics that feel quite complex by now. There is a big tech tree, which gives you a lot of decisions to make. But its a god-like-simulator, and god doesn't decide everything. The nuggets, which are the species populating the planet, build their houses on their own which gives the growth of the city a factor you can't influence.

So I really recommend this game. Even though there are some bugs in the current alpha state of the game. For example: Some names of my nuggets I renamed aren't shown right in the messages.

But most damning? It's [i]boring[/i]. There's no challenge in the game. Plop down a new water pump. Then an engineer hut. Wait for the timer to tick down for a minor boost to your little guys, or for a new building to slot in. Watching your little 'nuggets,' as the game annoyingly calls them, bop around is alright, but it rapidly becomes tiring, and the drip-fed powers means that you're not exactly always experimenting with what you can do. Telekenesis is pretty much only useful for tossing stuff into active construction sites, removing corpses and flinging things that would eat your dudes into space. That's it. Etc. Etc. Etc.

This is one of those games where I reccomend holding off and seeing what happens a few months down the line.",1535490863,1535490883,False,149,10,0.671821057796478271,20,True,False,True

Too bad saving isn't working for me. 

But let's be honest, it's a small team and games always take way longer to finish than people think.
Still it has a lot of potential. I'm sure they will pull through and finish it to a polished degree.

I don't know why these retarded indie games lack that ability, but I don't recommend this game to anyone that's never played. Another thing is that you need to learn to do everything on your own, still don't know how to order them to do stuff, and I've been playing for like 25 minutes. Just complete dumpster dive in educating me on how to do things. It's like tossing a 13 year old student in university and telling him to find quantum mechanics on rocket engines and expecting him to finish the report. The tutorials should point us to where things are located and what they are used for etc....reading alone doesn't help much.
