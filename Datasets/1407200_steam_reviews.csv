There are many toxic players, endless crybabies, noobs of every flavor.
For every twenty of them there is one good person who will help you out here and there.

Premium ammo, premium tanks, tanks you'll never be able to get, seal clubbers, and the ever present and forever annoying Arty.

If you can get past that and are willing to learn, the game is fun without using any money.
You just have to put in the work, learn by watching You Tube and Twitch, and keep at it.

Biggest two tips I can give you as a new player to other new players.......

Number one: Don't be first. Do not rush to the front. Play a support role. 
Learn the maps, help out, don't be the first one dead every game.

Number two: ALWAYS check the mini map, games change fast and if you're not aware of the big picture you get wrecked.
Always look at that mini map, every 10 seconds.
