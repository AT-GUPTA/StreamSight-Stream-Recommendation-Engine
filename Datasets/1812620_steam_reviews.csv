While this is a good app and I do appreciate how much you can do with it, I'm finding myself getting progressively more annoyed with it.

Kind of defeats the purpose of a startup app. If Wallpaper Engine, Steam or Signal RGB insisted on asking me if I wanted to spend extra money before launching the program I'd be even more annoyed.

BUT ALAS, getting my 5 euros was never ENOUGH, now you get the pop up to buy BETA 3.0 EVERYTIME YOU LAUNCH THE GODDAMN APP ( which will supposedly be free to to DSX buyers but can be bought beforehand, very greedy ).

Plus, having ONLINE DRM on a fking controller emulator... If I knew at the time I wouldn't have bought it, recently found out when I was without internet for 2 weeks vacation and couldn't launch the product I bought and has no reasonable use for DRM.

Overall, stick to the free version, setting up the triggers isn't worth it, use games with native support or just don't (it's cool and stuff but not required in the slighest).

So much time wasted with this program.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I bought the v2 when the new dual sense edge controller came out since it was the only one that supported the new back paddles.

I then bought the v3 beta because the UI in v2 was not to my liking and it had terrible performance, only to find out that the new shiny UI in v3 is extremely unintuitive. And that is an understatement. I cannot comprehend how convoluted it is to create a simple macro, like pressing two buttons to turn off the controller. There's cramped way to many options in. It shouldn't take me 10 minutes to scroll through every menu to find what I need. Back in v2 this was much more simple. Performance is better though, but that is the very least to ask for in a controller emulation program.

Now I also find out that I need an internet connection to use the program I BOUGHT TWICE??
Uninstalled it, wish I could refund it. Redownloaded DS4Windows, which I can use offline and I don't have to pay 5 eur for the next update.",1703796305,1704743696,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

DSX V3.0 Beta 5 has no Problems with the mentioned Far Cry 5 Vehicle Bug! In Xbox360 or DualShock Mode. (See Below)


Update 17.11.2023 
Since my inital Review the Developer has patched the Beta V3 Version several times.
So bite the Bullet, bought the DLC...

And surprise:
With the DLC Pack four 4 Bucks... A standard PS5 Dual-sense Controller is better supported than with DS4.

You can now (with the Beta Build) tweak the Hell out of the Controller.

The Interface is now Clear and every Option is explained. (For older Guys like me)
See for more Info the Store Page.

Only Caveat so far is the Driving a Vehicle Controller Bug in Far Cry 5.
The Left Trigger is not recognised...
How to Solve:
Exit DSX
Start DS4
Set DS4Windows to PS4 Emulation
Disable Steam Input Support in the Game Tab in your Steam Library.
Start the Game
FC5 will recognise the Controller as an PS4 Device and will switch the Game to the PS4 Buttons...

Gamers on PC using a Dual-Sense PS5 Controller... are in Tweak-Heaven
9 € Bucks is in my opinion okay...

Gamers using a Dualshock PS4 Controller can buy the V2 Base Version or DS4Windows (freeware)

****Old Review**** (Shame on me!)

THIS IS A NEUTRAL REVIEW
THANK YOU STEAM for only 2 Options... (sarcasm)

Update... 
It seems DS4 has it's own Problems... 
NonSteam Ubisoft and EPICrap Store Games are not recognizing my Dual Sense.
With DSX running No Problems... 

I change my Review to Neutral... and wait for further DSX Development...

TEST TEST 2023 recheck DSX after the new DLC...
My 50 Cent...
To put an Update behind a Paywall, speak release the Update as an DLC is okay...
But
DS4 is better, more streamlined and is free...
Steam has a solid PS4 & Switch Support and is free...

I wrote the review having not used DSX in over 2 months, but for the sake of making sure my review was correct, here is what I would update:

DSX wouldn't even work because it was conflicting with SignalRGB (and RGB control software I use) , after stopping SignalRGB DSX finally started ""working"" again.

By working I mean a slower less functional mess than I remembered. Applying triggers basically doesn't work, the app is super slow, takes a minute to boot up. After doing anything the app would freeze for a while, the general experience is unituitive and just not good.

It takes minutes to start up, switch tabs and change any settings, during which times it completely freezes up and becomes unresponsive. It seems to have only been written to support the main thread, it won’t start up at all if the app is not in focus. Sometimes it gets confused and thinks the DualSense is a speaker and pipes all my PC audio through the haptic rumble. If the controller disconnects sometimes the software just crashes. I’ve had multiple times where it generated absurd memory and CPU usage, grinding my PC to a halt and resisting any attempts to force quit (it is the only thing I've seen tank multiple Task Manager End Tasks) meaning I needed to hard reboot the thing. If one of the utilities it uses updates to a new version it can’t handle it and everything breaks requiring a full reinstall.

You cannot force users to have to be connected to the internet to be able to use a program that does not even require the internet.
For something similar, the Xbox almost disappeared for trying to force users to have to be connected 24 hours a day.

This is worse than Denuvo, requiring internet to be able to use a program in order to use a gamepad.

There are other programs that have the option to not use Steam/Internet, for example Borderless Gaming.

You can buy it and still use it without having to have Steam open, you even have the option of starting with Windows without having to use Steam.

Borderless Gaming even hundreds of buyers and owners, more than DSX and include the OFFLINE mode

Borderless Gaming userscore: 88% Owners: 200,000 .. 500,000
DSX userscore: 68% Owners: 50,000 .. 100,000

The system requirements are not correctly defined, as it should appear that you need to have Steam open and an internet connection to be able to use it.

There are many more free alternatives that do not require the requirements of this software.

I would guess the vast majority of the complaints are coming from console owners, that are just recently venturing into the PC. As even the trouble and quirks, I mention are all typically solved in 10 to 15 minutes of tinkering. 

As in the end, I have gain usage from my Dual Sense Edge, that I wouldn't have otherwise. The cost to be able to use my controller on games that never had any support for them is well worth the small cost, especially in comparison to the price of the Edge. It would only be expect that if you are making something that is not supposed to work, to actually work, the process with have some quirks to work around.

This is one major selling point that I personally got this product for (or hoped for). I thought that eventually they would figure out how to do it yet here we are. It is stated that it is impossible due to firmware or Windows bluetooth limitations. If that's the case, I don't want to play wired all the time. That is all there is to it. 

You still cannot adjust anti deadzone, a very basic feature that DS4windows had for years. You will use the gamepad as an X360 pad for the majority of the games out there which has built in high deadzones. This should've been a priority, at least should've been there with the big V3 update.

If you're like me who primarily uses the gamepad wirelessly, I cannot recommend this product. Most of the advantages this program has over free alternatives work only with wired. I have nothing against that, it is just that I don't like playing wired anymore.

I don't even understand the point of Dualsense emulation (dualsense into virtual dualsense) if it is not going to support haptics. Supposedly you can enjoy adaptive triggers over bluetooth this way. But the funny thing is, you can already enjoy adaptive triggers over bluetooth in Ratchet and Clank without using any software. So the point of DLC is also lost on me, and I feel like they have focused their efforts on wrong things for a long time.

All in all, I cannot recommend this product in this state. My perception might change if they add anti deadzone tweaking and an option to disable hardware acceleration. If they can make it so that it can use haptics features over bluetooth, I'd recommend this program to anyone I know that use Dualsense.

However, even though I used it plenty - I can't in good faith recommend it (for the time being) for a couple reasons:

* V2.0 was ""broken"" in a way, for a good bunch of months while V3 was under development. It was in a good state before becoming ""broken"". What I mean is: slower bootup times than what were once achieved, clicking settings froze the program for about 10 ~ 20 seconds, could crash for whatever reason or when interacting with DSX while in frozen state. A paying customer is a paying customer and there is no excuse as to why their currently usable version of your product should be malfunctioning/handicapped - EVEN IF you are developing a better version in the meantime. Sure, the hard part is done and V3 is finally around the corner, but who's to say something similar won't happen again in the future?

* I said this before and I'll say it again, there HAS to be a way to use this type of software OFFLINE/without launching Steam per reboot, or any other third party launcher for that matter. Using an extension to make your controller more useful should be fast, easily accessible and most of all, not feel like a chore. Figure something out, find a way to force a one-time license check for each user or something. I have plenty of non-Steam games, many of which are playable offline and sometimes I either don't have access to the internet or simply don't wanna open Steam separately just to open this software and play an offline game. I paid for a program that should have brought my Dualsense to the same level of an Xbox controller - what I got is unlocked potential and extra features, with a catch. This shouldn't be the case. Imagine if our Dualsense could have this sort of functionality AND feel as if it's Plug & Play...

* Back in January I requested Offline Usage as a feature, this being met with an answer along the lines of: adjustments will be made for V3 so that you will be able to verify ownership without having to open Steam. Even if that didn't mean true offline it would still be something! Fast forward 10 months and nothing of the sort. Yet I stuck around hoping.

I truly wish the developers the best and thank them for their efforts, but these are my honest thoughts. It's such marvelous work - but for something that should be complimentary to my controller, my experience with it has been more cumbersome than I'd have liked. I say all this because I KNOW it could be better and it SHOULD be.

I'd be more than willing to pay for an update that addresses this issue.

Also Audio Haptics are not that cool overall and I turned them off, because game music and other sounds make haptics “vibrate too much”. I had to manually downgrade DSX to version 2.3.2 to stay in control of functions I really need, rather than being forced in any upgrades. But that is just me ;)

Amazing, handy app. Finally, DualSense on PC is working full gear with its cool adaptive triggers and audio haptics. I use DSX for all games via long high-end USB cable (properly concealed to reach controller. Playing on 65″ OLED TV, 7.1 surround soundbar, Dolby Access). Looking forward to upcoming new version and wish the app to inherit stability as well as solid performance

What's the use of controller software  without re-mapping and other INPUT functions. To name one: touchpad settings could use some refining.  Basically what DSX does is monitoring game state and translating it to haptics and lights on the controller. I now got it to work TOGETHER with DS4W  thanks to HID-Hide (thanks Nefarius) 
IMO the only really useful function is the feedback on the triggers. Makes flightsim rudder control easier.

Different kinds of feedback and adjustable response curve on the triggers. Fancy rgb.  Button mapping... Overall feel is ok.  Stability not always great. And missing some degree of calibration for the L3+R3 sticks. Sure Steam covers that but having it in one place would be better imo and joystick mouse control. I need that for DCS...  DS4W did that. DSX not so much. However the possibility of me being a stupid dickhead for not understanding all this modern day mambo jambo, is also pretty real. I'll give it a thumb but for the free version. Not really sure what the payed version added, in functionality or things i frequently use.

The best part of this app and the reason i started using it is because it completely solved all of my issues using a dualsense controller for gamepass. I was using the free version and it was working fine. I only paid for the app because it did such a good job. You can customize custom controls in the way of changing buttons into keyboard functions. for example, you could change your ""X"" button to be a spacebar if you wanted. It also allows you to use adaptive triggers, change colors and lots of little tweaks like that. Everything advertised just seems to work.

The bad part of this app first and foremost are the hangups. The app loves to freeze up when its first opening or if you work too fast in it. I have a beefy computer and that doesn't help. But once you get it set up the first time you mostly just minimize it and forget that its running. My other complaint is the ui. It uses that fancy type of design (UX Maybe?) and doesn't allow you to scale it however you like. Not a huge deal. But i use a vertical monitor and it wont fit on the screen or allow me to minimize it enough to put it there. This could be fixed by adding a vertical option or just ditching the fancy design altogether. It would also help the performance. It is taking up 218mb of memory right now and im not doing anything abnormal. I should also say i bought this program for two other people and it didn't work for either of them. It could be operator error but it didnt seem like it. However steams refund policy makes that pretty irrelevant. 

So altogether, i would say if you need a job done, this program will do it. It just needs some work on the performance side of things. It's worth testing out the free version at least. I know the dev has some big things he is working on. And im excited to see this program evolve.

(I will be back to change my review as updates happen.)

Keep in mind, I personally was using it with a PS5 pro controller pretty much solely to map the back buttons. The application has some other features, but this is my review and I didn't have need of them.

Pros: Very simple and easy to understand, remapping buttons was easy, there were a number of options for stick and button sensitivity options, including haptic trigger settings, which if I ever want to use in the future will 100% bring me back to using this.

Cons: The software can be somewhat laggy, I believe it is trying to minimize the resources it uses as to not lag games, which I appreciate, but I have a beefy PC, I'd rather lose 2 fps and have the application respond when I click on it to change something. My only other complaint is likely due to the app clashing with steam's newest update, since I've only had it recently, but the software would temporarily change my binds and at one point refused to even read that I had the controller plugged in if I was trying to emulate a Dual Shock 4. It's not fun to have your roll button sometimes turn into the jump button in the middle of playing Elden Ring.

I am trying to use a Dualsense Edge controller via Bluetooth, which I figured would be a basic use case that this program could handle well, but it seems to have huge mood swings. Some days, it works fine, doesn't cut out, doesn't hiccup, yada yada. Others, it's a nightmare of constant cut outs, software freezes, my controller suddenly not being recognized anymore, or the program claiming my controller is very low on battery and therefore not usable (when it really isn't).
Not to mention that the UI is extremely slow. Clicking on the Settings menu causes the program to freeze for about 30 seconds until it finally opens. Same goes for other areas of the UI, to a lesser extent.

It hangs a lot when you switch scenes in the app or settings. Can't be launched without steam sync, which is a big deal for me... You might want to buy it if... you want to buy it. For general usage there are free alternatives or 1-t version. The only reason to use it is to use adaptive triggers, but there's no game detecion and auto switch of profiles. No option to download community profiles too.

Hope to see DS5 full support in the mid-summer to stop switching text files, which default to desktop instead of a folder I created for them.

I still stand behind my old points. The paid version seems pretty pointless compared to the free version. The free version actually does some things better compared to the paid version, the paid version just has some quality of life features but not anything I'd say is actually worth paying for compared to the free version, which is still available.

So what are you getting with the paid version compared to the free one?
You get the ability to change the emulation without having to restart the application, you can change the adaptive trigger profiles (which in my opinion are kind of a gimmick and fun for a few times but nothing more) and you get updates, for whenever those happen.

What does the free version do better?
First off, it doesn't require steam. I have never been able to start the paid version of DualsenseX without having to also start steam. Look at wallpaper engine, it can launch and run without having steam running in the background if you want to. If you don't have steam as a startup program but want to use the paid version of DualsenseX it needs to also launch steam first. The free version also launches faster and seems a whole lot more stable. Sure the free version needs to be restarted when changing the emulation, but on a decently modern PC this really won't take long at all. You will be stuck with a permanent ""update available"" notification when launching the free version.

Lately I've had my paid version of DualsenseX crash on me constantly when going into the different tabs like the controller tab or settings tab so I can't even do anything with it right now. It also doesn't seem to work with some games like Forza Horizon. The free version doesn't either, but it's one of my most played games with controller.
Thus I will say I very much recommend you take a look at DS4Windows. It supports the Dualsense controller (not sure about the Dualsense Edge controller), and although it might not support all the features, I haven't ran into a problem where I want a certain feature to work in DS4Windows that it doesn't support.

I'm still gonna wait and see what DualsenseX V3 is going to be like and see if it actually works properly, launches properly and works with all the games that DS4Windows works with, but for now I'm gonna say this. Don't waste your money on DSX when there's a free program out there that, although it might be a bit less user friendly, does work properly, is stable and also works with Forza Horizon.",1669977250,1683404463,False,1,0,0,2,True,False,False

К слову, с этим прекрасно и сам стим справляется, убирая эту костыльную прогу, которая запускается дольше самих игр.
Да, тут есть пожилые вибрации и все фичи от PS5 (хотя я так и не понял как с ними играть, и не сильно то хотелось, чтобы перед запуском игры надо было бы сидеть несколько минут и все там активировать).
Самое забавное - прога предлагает пресет адаптивных триггеров и особой вибрации для Skyrim SE, однако, даже просто эмулировать способный к игре DualShock дэсэхэ не способна, поэтому кроме кринжа и смеха эта утилита более и не вызывает.
Не скажу что покупка ненужная - потыкать там, включить дышащую подсветку она может, это действительно классно, но постоянно ее запускать и ждать пол дня пока она после вылета откроется надоедает, поэтому как человек юзавший ее около полугода могу сказать - это просто прога без какого-либо смысла, 5/10 только за подсветку.
Ах да, конечно же про неработающую эмуляцию под четвертную плойку я писал в дискордик поддержки, говорю мужу - не робит ничего, ответ убил - данные игры не поддерживаются эмуляцией, попробуйте другие.

I understand it's always been a difficult niche to accommodate but I've relied on software released by selfless independent developers since I first picked up Better DS3 almost a decade ago. Most software throughout the years has been fully released as freeware. Having to pay to use this software may seem like a turnoff at first, but I've had my money's worth and then some. DSX is a fine piece of work and is truly the latest best software available for those who seek full functionality of their Dualsense controllers. With a mere $5.00 entry fee, the features are well worth it.

Once Steam introduced Steam Input, I thought the days of using external software to use my controllers were long past me. Unfortunately, Steam Input does not support adaptive trigger functionality -- that is where this software comes in. Not many games support the technology yet but I sincerely hope that within time, developers will start to realize the market for this wonderful technology and implement it in many more PS5 ports and crossplay titles.

As far as DSX goes, I have seldom had issues with it. Disabling Steam Input is absolutely necessary in order to use this software. Steam Input has no support for adaptive trigger functionality and thus must be turned off in order to use DSX. This software will serve as the new interface for your controller information and configuration. Upon playing some games (Dark Souls Remastered namely) I have had to restart my PC in order for games to recognize DSX, but I consider that a nonissue. There are worse things in the world than waiting a few minutes to play a game. My most used feature is toggling between Xinput, Dualshock 4, and native Dualsense emulation on the fly. I am often able to minimize games and change controller types without needing to restart the game again.

Most games require a wired connection in order to use adaptive trigger functionality, however there are some games that are able to utilize this technology over just Bluetooth alone. I don't consider this to be an issue within DSX.

Hey, did you know?  Before the Steam release, this was a free program.  And that free version's still available, and works infinitely better than this version.  I bought it because I wanted to throw the developers a bone and see what else they can do with this program.  So far, the only new feature to my knowledge that's of any use is the program not needing to restart upon switching the controller it's supposed to emulate; beyond that, all that's new as far as I've seen is a Konami Code and some achievements.  Nothing of any utilitarian use EXCEPT not needing to constantly restart, but if that was the cost for making the game refuse to boot, I'd rather it have to constantly restart.  It's such a shame - this program has such promise, and I want to believe the programmers are passionate about their work so far, but as it stands right now, I would sooner recommend The Callisto Protocol, because on an objective level, it can actually boot up, which is more than can be said for this program right now.",1670541967,1670542590,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Their Tech should be a standard on Any platform and Games. the bad thing about Dualsense is that Rechargable Battery, if it died you have to tear it down. but other than that DS5 is a amazing controller. 

And DSX exist. this is why DS5 is the best controller for PC. You can customized anything. LED, Adaptive Trigger even the build in Speaker. You can connect via Cable or Bluetooth.

I can use Dualsense Features on Cyberpunk 2077 and Forza Horizon! yeah its not perfect as native but its pretty cool!. Not all games thou, it need some Modification or connection between game and DSX so no Instant Magic. so need to be Supported by game's community to expand their library.

The meh about this software its that Like any Xinput Emulator or whatever like DS4Windows, X360ce and Steam's Controller Support, they emulate. so if your game only support Xinput or only have Xbox icon, in game button will be Xbox. DSX have DS4 Emulation thou so game can detect Dualshock Controller and change in game button to PlayStation. but if your game can Support DirectInput or Support DS5 natively, no reason to use this software. 

im a gamer so theres no issue with Missmatch icon button so...yeah.

And problem with DSX is that you cant open the software without Opening Steam. i mean sure your computer can handle it easy you probably have 12 threads Processor these days. but Why??? waste of time you know.

If you want a better and free alternative go for DS4Windows (DSX wouldn't exist without DS4Windows), it has better performance and this software will be deprecated soon anyways...

New features are completely useless except if you want to know you many times you pressed your X button and control your Dualsense's LED.

DSX.exe takes about 250,000 K~ memory while DS4Windows takes 60,000 K~ memory. (See that huge memory gap? Yeah, that's poor coding probably made by a CS student, even Discord takes less memory!) As for CPU usage, it's about the same, takes too much from the CPU (5-10%~)

The software is aesthetically disgusting, I mean who uses border-radius at 12px with a gradient background? A CS student! (Not that it isn't a bad thing)

Making it simple DS4Windows has the same features as DSX except for the Adaptive Triggers/Discord Rich Presence/Stupid Easter Eggs and in DS4Windows, you can remap your buttons while in DSX you can't.

I used this software when it was open-source but now it's just a massive cash grab!! Please, don't waste your money on this and give it to somebody local who needs it!",1664284694,1664741612,False,20,8,0.471347779035568237,0,True,False,False

I have 32GB of DDR4 and a 3900x, and it's eating 500MB of ram and 2% of my CPU usage just by having it open. It takes up as much RAM as Spotify, Discord, and Steam COMBINED!
Additionally, what keeps happening is I go to close DSX and later re-open it, but it takes a whole system restart to actually use it again! For some reason, the icon on my desktop vanished and replaced itself with a blank image- but it's somehow running as I type this. Wizardry.

You can't remap your controls, you can't change the stick deadzones, and there's some other missing features.. BUT.

I would say the UI is better than most other types of software like this out there, which is nice. The ability to change my LEDs on my controller is also great for using my controller in the dark, a total gamechanger coming from a Hyperkin Duke!(screen in controller, Xbox startup animation) You can even set the player status LEDs to indicate your battery life- genius!

I hope the developers update and fix this software because it's great to use- as a base; but with these issues, and considering I have the best computer of anyone I really know, I couldn't recommend it to them, so I can't recommend it here in it's current state. Hopefully, that changes!

this is NOT THE APP FOR IT.

You can test your dualsense features with it, analog, haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, you can test them all so it is good.
You can change lighting on your dualsense to anything (showing battery percentage with lighting color is amazing) or simply disable lighting.
You can emulate a DS4 or an Xbox 360/One controller
edit: it is EXTREMELY cheap though

That is it. It says it can add adaptive triggers to some other games, did not work for me.
It says it can let you use some features wireless, did not work for me.
Both steam and github support/communities are dead. Nobody knows nothing, no official responses. It is a trial based thing.
It is supposed to NOT USE steam and not show ""DSX"" as ""playing"" so how come i have ""played"" it 0.4 hours today?

I have Playstation+ and I got DualSense contollers assuming, like I think many may have, that the new system would support the new controllers. Nay nay. It only supports DualShock 4. A quick talk with Sony support confirmed this and that there are, at least currently, no plans for DualSense support. So I was literally blocked from even really starting a bunch of games because of touchpad prompts. Then I came across this. Not only did it have the promise of full emulation but also enabling the haptic triggers. SIGN ME UP! So I quickly pulled the trigger (look these bad jokes just happen) and loaded it up. 

#1: Haptics. Oh my gosh. Being able to put full tactile feedback on a pull is amazing.
#2: Minor adjustments only. The only thing I disabled was using touchpad as a mouse click
#3: Instant gratification. The moment I loaded into game I was presented with the same touchpad prompt and BAM worked immediately
#4: MODS!!!! Need I say more?

From UI to features, it is clear that the developer has spent a lot of time and effort on perfecting the program. For example, when I first launched the program, it identified my DualSense controller's firmware version and warned me to update to the latest version and provided me a link to Sony's firmware updater program. I didn't know that I could update the controller from PC, so it's been a really useful indicator. The program offers a ton of features and yet organized in a way that new users can easily navigate through. 

There is a section for game mods to support DualSense's advanced features like adaptive triggers. I've installed the GTA V mod and it worked just as intended.
