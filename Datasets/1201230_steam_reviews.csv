Another thing that stands out to me is this game's premise and characters: I know a lot of feedback wants there to be a romance option, but personally I don't see the need for it? It's because even without that, I manage to find the relationships you build to be enjoyable on its own. All of them have recognizable personalities and it feels like they all have their own character arcs going on. I love that all of them are connected to a gameplay mechanic - it makes it feel like everyone has a role to play in the story.

My primary complaint with this game is the combat is way too much of a grind. I like the bullet-hell nature of the dungeons, it's fun to kite around all the chaos, but you get exp incredibly slowly, and your level caps your maximum damage.

Go for it. Recommended game if you play simulators like stardew valley etc.

I used to play coral island and was looking for some game that can fill the void and not bring about the frustration of constant bugs and need to replay every small update. This game fills the void and does a far better job than other similar games

1. No Regional Farm Locations - 
No individual farming regions that need teleportation or relocation like in some games (i believe sun haven game). You can peacefully finish all farming tasks within a few minutes (its all nearby) and then move on to other activites

2. No fixed sleep time or Energy restoration every day -
This makes the game a bit more challenging and has the player constantly managing their activity versus when to sleep for restoring enough energy for the next day. Makes game less boring 

3. Cooking Mega Collection -
Lots of cooking recipes and as a person who loves cooking in farming games... This game really fills the void with the variety of dishes and tools used in the kitchen to cook. This is so much more fun to do than in any of the other games ive played (coral island has cooking but its much simplified and mundane in comparison to this game)

4. Non timed Quests -
Its not that easy or quick to finish. The game forces the player to forget being a try hard achiever and just do quests at a leisurely pace as and when they get materials for completing them. There is a lot of things to do that this is the first time I'm not annoyed/frustrated that i have pending quests all the time.

Cons - Some quests that provide benefit early are placed late in the timeline or require materials that u get later or are even slightly vague in one or two cases so u need to look at the quest tree to know what u missing and what u need to do to progress 

5. Storyline -
Simple enough but good story nonetheless (without any spoilers)... but im not usually interested in the lore or story as much as the fishing, cooking or farming... Its pretty straightforward if your looking for cons

6. Fishing - 
A little different from stardew valley. Fish bite the hook from anywhere between their 1st to their 5th attempt on the hook. There is a large variety of fish and no minigame to catching them (becomes frustrating in stardew valley if u want to fish a lot)

7. Resource gathering-
Initially a bit tough but as soon as u get helpers, they become a great asset to reduce a lot of the grinding. Just remember most quests are non timed so just take ur time to get the resources and focus on what u like to do most

8. Farming -
Lots of variety, Lots of seasonal crops for u to mix and match.. U can also use spells to place seeds or water ur plants. Gets easier once u start getting basic auto sprinklers which are not too hard to make and are available much earlier than other games

9. Combat -
Combat is not difficult and a bit of a bullet hell scenario.. doesnt feel mundane for me as im busy trying to gather than fight... There are a lot of locations for u to traverse over time for combat and gathering so it will give u plenty of fighting over time and story progression (im not even halfway through at 68 hours game time)

10. Translations-
Very small translations are in English. Its NOWHERE as problematic as a lot of review claim. No major quests or goals are blocked due to non English words (as far as ive seen).

Conclusion-
An absolute time waster.. lots to do... definitely recommend

Sometimes you'll find characters phasing through hills as they exit a building and some scenes/attacks/hits feel as if they lack an impact due to the lack of sound effects.

It has very little interesting or new mechanics, despite its theme. Most of the ""new"" mechanic feel more like reskin of common mechanics of the genre than mechanics that are unique to its theme. The only thing of note is the decoration system, which looks decent compared to its competitors.

If that is the only problem, then it's still fine. However, the game clearly suffers from a long early access phase for a story-dependent and surprisingly linear game. While the early game have many things and plot points going on simultaneously, the game quickly bottlenecks by mid-game. I played a little over one in-game year and by Fall, there is rarely anything happening and it's mostly just the same grind over and over again. Even the bosses are just glorified mooks. I've finished 5 dungeons so far and I've yet to see a boss have more than one move. Moreover, so far, 3/5 shows up as regular random enemy in the next dungeon onward.

Some may say that the genre is inherently grindy, which is true. However, the grind is usually broken up with entertaining events that shows the camaraderie of the town. Immortal Life on the other hand is poorly written with the majority of quest, even main quests, written like a random fetch quest. Very few members of the town that isn't a romantic partner, has any development and largely exist to provide fetch quests or shops. Even the ""bond events"" with the main romantic cast are often like 5-10 lines long.

Example of features that Rune Factory, My Time at Portia, etc. has that this game is missing:
- Town-wide events (no, the new year event doesn't count, it involves absolutely no characters and it just a puzzle)
- Taming and/or companions in battle
- Variety of weapons. Low variety of abilities (most of them are just projectiles or explosion around self)
- Real boss battles",1708179372,1708180582,False,2,0,0.501901149749755859,0,True,False,False

The pace or rather the passing of time is very fast compared to the other farming games I played and my first few hours I was rushing to do all the quests because I wanted more NPC's and items but to each their own pace :)

I like that this game gives me goals (quests) to work towards instead of just freestyle farming, and also gives me reasons to befriend the other sect members (otherwise you can't unlock new places!) and they're all actually endearing, even the one that annoys me to death lol (Wei Hong I am LOOKING at you).
The game is not yet finished apparently (they'll add more content yay) but that doesn't bother me much, you can decorate your house and farm quite freely in ancient china style and make more clothes for your character which already takes MUCH of your time and money so it's not like I can't wait for an update...

Though I have to say; there isn't a romance system implemented yet but I am sure People already love the art style of the npc's, everybody is quite attractive but they'll eventually add that and the current friendship only relationship you have to them is already quite good - PATIENCE is the keyword here 

The fighting and exp for your cultivation starts to get grindy at some point (which can be good or bad, depends on the person)  and I suck at dodging the monsters BUT health elixirs ftw I guess ;)
People who want to make money with many kinds of makers and machines would be disappointed though, this is ancient china and there weren't that many types of makers l guess? (there is a jar and a drying rack) The main income literally comes from farming - we still get rich don't worry guys ;)

I'd say after 100 h+ playtime I at least got my money's worth and don't really have any big complaints beside small things that don't bother me that much (achievements updating after booting up the game for example), so I'll keep waiting for more updates while starting a new character or playing some other games while waiting!

It's different than most farming games and does enough to set itself apart. It does have the staple of having a mine and a plot to do your farming. Instead of the usual 'your grandpa left his farm to you', you arrive as someone wanting to join Guiyun Sect in an attempt to pursue immortality.

There's no romance in the game, but you are able to get a roommate (house mate). The story seems to be interesting without any unnecessary filler and the characters all have defining personalities. 


The graphics and music suit the game well and give a cottage-core esque feel. Seasons are done a bit differently but you do have your usual Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter. There is a bit of spiritual magic in the game as well to make combat in the mines and farming easier.

My biggest gripe with the game is the clunky-ish controller support but in reality, it isn't THAT bad. You get used to it rather quickly (ex: in the menu, the diagonal pad navigates the tabs and the analog stick goes through the options in that tab, B is your 'A' and A is your 'B' for jumps/confirmations and the like).

I first heard of this game around 2022 and the concept sounded super cool but I wasn't that deep into farming games nor did I have a laptop or pc to play Steam games for a while. I was ready to pick this up last year when I got a Steam Deck but I heard safe files weren't working at that time so I avoided it once again but it's been on my wishlist for a very long time. Heard it was releasing full launch this month so I bought it during the winter sale and it's been 9 days where I have sunk 60+ hours in. I'll be explaining the genre, pros and cons.

What is Immortal Life?
It's a Chinese fantasy but to be specific, xianxia/wuxia farming rpg game. Xianxia is inspired by Chinese mythology and influenced by philosophies of Taosim, Chan Buddhusim, Chinese martial arts, medicine, alchemy. Wuxia on the other hand is fantasy and martial arts. They are pretty similar terms but I would say xianxia tends to have more fantasy elements compared to wuxia, it really depends though. Instead of the usual going to a new area after your grandpa sends you a letter as most farming games start off, you're invited to cultivate in the Guiyun Sect except a diaster strikes and now with new friends, you're helping rebuilding the sect. You'll be attending to crops, cooking, mining, decorating, establish friendships and assist in waking up sleeping beauty that's in coma where half the story is locked behind him.

Pros (There will slight spoilers)
- Graphics. This game is gorgeous. I was so impressed by how beautiful it was when I started. Screenshots and videos don't always do justice in how a game looks like and for this one, I agree on that.
- Cooking. The cooking in this game is so much fun, I have played a few cafe games and the cooking Immortal Life offers is so addicting, interesting and fun. Now there is a small con where you're against a timer that will determine if the meals is 3 stars or 1 star as the lowest. Due to this timer, I felt pressured and didn't cook unless I was required to. Well after I had to rebuild the kitchen in the sect, I learned how to cook. I won't spoil why but if you do feel pressured by it, continue to practice more. It will be so rewarding later on!
- Story/Friendships. Don't want to spoil it but recruiting some of the members have an amazing story/questline. I tend to ignore main stories for most farming games as I feel like lately some have been pretty basic but Immortal Life strays away from that. The friendship meter to level up is kind of slow in this game but the rewards are so worth it.
- Cosmetics. You don't get to unlock outfits until later on, it's a pretty mid game thing which is unlocked by a character so make sure you're doing your quests. The outfits, however, are gorgeous. There's one type of outfit with like 5 (?) color options. Currently there are 32 in EA (From the shop) and as I'm writing this review but I think full launch will be more?
- Decorating. This game has a mechanic similar to Stardew Valley where you offer items to unlock stuff which furniture items are one of them. There are several sets in EA already and full launch will have more. The sets are gorgeous, I have not decorated yet since I'm waiting to see what full launch offers but I am building up spirit stones (currency) so I can buy all the items when I can.
- Length of the Game. If you're looking for a game to sink 100 hours in, Immortal Life will satisfy you. There is a grind to this game but I don't consider it to be an issue especially with how slow the friendships feel to level up. You're probably going to be going beyond Year 4 to finish the main story which to me is rebuilding all the broken places in Guiyun Sect.

Cons I have for Immortal Life based on my experience so far (May contain spoilers)
- Personally, I don't like heavy story driven games which Immortal Life is quite heavy on that. The main story is really long and towards the end, it gets tedious with growing legendary crops where you'll probably end up sleeping the days away.
- Friendship is very slow. Someone did a test that if you give them their loved +9, talk to them +1 and host a banquet +9, it takes 3 months to do. If you're giving a mix of liked and loved, this will take over a year to do. You only need 5/6 hearts filled to get their special final heart reward but you'll need 6/6 for the Steam achievement. There's also a character that gets introduced literally at the end of the story.

After 90 hours, these are pretty much all the cons I have. A lot of the ones I had when posting this back in Jan, it was updated during full launch which was really nice. Again, I adore this game and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a ""fresh"" take on the farming genre. It is also getting updates after launch but the main story is done and will take about 50 hrs if you don't get stuck like me haha. Thank you to the Devs for making an amazing game, this was one of my favorites in January and so far my favorite farming game of 2024!",1705139178,1707685925,True,95,0,0.890864253044128418,1,True,False,True

I hadn't played since the last major board update, and ended up playing almost the entirety of my two days off.
Great game if you're a fan of Stardew, or Chinese Immortal Fantasys, or especially both. The art is well done and memorable, your ability to customize your space pretty wild as you get up there, and the varied lands you visit are diverse; while building the sect and your relationships feels like an actual accomplishment as you literally raise it from the rubble building by building.

While there's fighting in the game, it's incredibly easy to manage with a keyboard (I haven't tried it with my controller ...yet: as I didn't want to relearn the control mapping after first playing with a KB in early access) and progression though sometimes a little confusing (especially around the foundation levels of cultivation); generally goes at a decent rate.
 
Honestly I have very few complaints or suggestions about how this game could be better. Tons of ways to change your look, pets, lots of things to plant, monsters to kill, places to explore and stuff to cook. (gawd are there a LOT of recipes from the kitchen to the alchemy forge, to the crazy amount of decorations in this game.)

I do wish you could get into bunny girl's world more quickly, and that there were animals???? Like.. actual cows etc. 
Then again; looking at my exploration list now: I'm only MAYBE half way through what Immortal Life has to offer.. and haven't even gotten my superior tools other than the fishing pole..... so maybe there are? lol

Either way, big recommend over all.

As far as the standard comparisons go, this is much closer to a Rune Factory than Stardew Valley, with much more focus on a surprisingly compelling bullet hell style combat system than farming.  The pacing definitely does not follow the Stardew Valley model, where each season is a long and full experience and an entire full playthrough of the game will peter out some time in the second year.  Seasons go by much faster, each comprised of 6, 3-day solar periods that make for a consistent rhythm year round once you've unlocked most of the main features, even in winter.  Crops have good and bad seasons, but all crops Can grow in any season, and will never wither between seasons.  This eventually lead me to lose interest in the minutiae of growing crops and just plant vast monocultures every 3-6 days, freeing up mental space for the Real game; collecting resources for progressing your character's cultivation in a multitude of ways as well as progressing the numerous interweaving main quest plotlines.  This is both to the game's credit and it's deficit, as each day feels meaningful for your first several years, but eventually you'll hit one of the games few progression pace cars that will see you needing to kill vast swathes of enemies for cultivation experience, or micromanage this games version of the greenhouse over the course of a dozen days or more.  Relationships with your fellow sect members follows a similar pattern; it feels like it'd take over a decade to reach max hearts with any one person if you're not able to find one of their few loved, spammable gifts, but the small cast lets each character feel meaningful even if you're not actively pursuing friendship with them.

All in all, this is a refreshingly creative effort in a genre that oftentimes just comes down to ""Stardew Valley but.""

喜欢种田的每天就是种种种收收收的， 这就是你的最爱，
打怪升级， 探索欲和好奇让我 各种种种种， 各种剧情还是喜欢师姐的一言不合的包养费持续一年。 
各个师兄就是各个需要帮助， 还有个高冷女生在后山需要你舔，每天就是让师兄去钓小乌龟来舔高冷女生。
这简直就是一个赞。 虽然我不喜欢舔狗的剧情。 但真香理论 来看， 还是挺有意思的。 
然后升级方面不是很有引导， 我卡在练气初级一年， 师兄师姐们都练气后期了， 我都找不到通关信息，本来游戏打算就是每天发掘新事件搞不好就有好玩的。 到成卡狗了。 后来实在想不通了， 想上网看看教程， 居然没有教程。 不是， 你好歹也出个wiki吧。

后来终于升级了的时候我的植物仓库已经成为了历史（每种橙色10+20+）；（每种蓝色50+）；（每种绿色99）；（每种普通99）。先不说财富自由随手买几个99+种子包还是没有问题的。
种田的那部分提个小建议： 收割的时候那个种子提示音能成为收割了99+ 什么的可以吗？ 而不是一直提示+1+1+1+1+1， 然后我收割一次那个种子提示音+1 x999 太烦了， 我收割一次听20分钟提示音， （救救我，救救我，救救我）。 或许加个禁止提示音也行啊。 这里直接把我干焦虑了。 
然后背景音乐有卡顿， 那个优化一下。
煮菜的那些支线我有点尴尬， 都是拖到终于有菜谱才能做， 不然只能干盯着， 支线就算了，你主线也是煮菜的， 我就很不了解了， 所以一个字拖， 拖到你是富一代为止才结束；前期有些主线和支线太超前很不友好。
煮菜有卡顿， 僵硬， 引用缝合混乱厨房的因素（overcook2） 菜单太大， 有时候看不到菜篮子。 时间卡太紧了。 
前期体力和蓝超级低， 提升程度到后期得多花心思去搞不然种完田才过了三小时， 只能睡觉。 你有冥想恢复蓝， 建议睡觉可以增加小休’。一个小bug：升级浇花器， 旋转不到位， 转了等于没转， 旋转得做两次， 然后睡一觉居然重置了， 又要转一次（rotation） 到最后太麻烦我懒得理了。 我25个浇水器每个重置3遍， 只能摆烂了。 解决一下。 
最后说一下MOD 小破站上好多， 但是都下载不了， 要么链接不到位还是啥， 还是希望支持开发工坊。
最后游戏还是值得入手的， 也支持手柄， 但好像有些小毛病。
如果跑步可以搞个加速更好了。

At the root of it, this is more of a farming game similar in vein to Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon. As a matter of fact as soon as you start playing you will notice many conceptual similarities to Stardew. So many, that it may be easier to talk about the differences.

At the core of it, the main difference is that this game has less emphasis on the actual farming and the farming part is much easier. Instead the focus seems to be on quest progression. You can grow any crop in any season, with a reduced harvest penalty if out of season, but more than sufficient for you to tick off any quest you need to hand in. And even if you planned things out really poorly, you also have easy access to instant harvest spell scrolls to fix things up in a jiffy. A lot more of the game progression is tied to quest chains instead of requiring amassing resources. There is less need to plan out every second of your first 13 days of spring to buy 100 strawberry seeds so that you can snowball enough money and materials to complete the community centre vaults and your house upgrades in year 1. Instead you focus on completing main quests so that Li Mengqing can unlock different dungeons for you to mine different types of materials for those upgrades. Resources are still required of course, but for comparison - by end of year 1 summer in my current (and first) game in Immortal Life, I found myself quite happy with my farm of 160 tiles, while in Stardew I've generally ended up with at least 400 tiles.

On the other hand, as you might expect, caving and combat are far more important. Instead of just the normal caves and skull caverns, there are multiple dungeons. Levelling up has a combat section itself as well. There are things like bosses, combat spells.

Conceptually the side hustles such as fishing, cooking, etc are not much different. The difficulties in those vary, but in the end it is still the case that there are a few things on the side you need to do to supplement the main game. The cooking mini game in Immortal Life is somewhat more interesting than most game's cooking mini game in my opinion. It is quite time consuming in terms of real time, but on the plus side you can skip it on subsequent cooking after successfully cooking each recipe.

Levelling up is replaced with Xianxia cultivation. Which seem like different concepts but they serve very similar game play functions.",1706991117,1706991117,True,7,0,0.612410902976989746,0,True,False,False

There is a severe bottleneck with progression that some players (like myself) can hit. You need to get at least a couple hearts with Li Mingqeng and complete her sidequests before you can unlock a large portion of the content. You'll understand if it happens to you. So make sure to cozy up to her fast, make sure you unlock the trade routes quickly so you can see what you need to do to get access to chili pepper seeds, and make sure to get Li the minced chili pepper for her friend quest quickly.

In-game time flies really fast and it's hard to put yourself with some kind of deadline on completing main building areas which are useful for cultivation sake. When I have the hang of it, I started to relax and let go of my pursuit and it becomes more enjoyable tbh. Quests have no time limit as long as it doesn't came from board so it's pretty chill. Farming isn't a big deal as long as you focus on making auto sprinklers early in the game, I did it on first year and I'd say I'm lucky enough to get it done by the first year so now I can do a lot more on second year and so on.

Overall, it's a solid farming with some combat and tons of quests to unlock amazing features to assists player to progress.

Tips:
- focus on auto farm to make life easier so you can do quests with ease later on.

- Had you have any chance to accomplish wandering merchant that comes on 1st 3rd and 5th week every season, please do yourself a favor and complete it and unlock more inventory space as early as you can.
- If you need any money(spirit stone), dive into dungeon as they have tons of items that value quite high in early game. Compared to farming, it's faster that way.

I mean that as respectfully as possible, because this game is seriously brilliant. I was utterly taken with this game and can't stop playing it. 
It's very refreshing, peaceful (yes, even in the action parts) and pleasant game. I ADORE the chinese voicing (English translation in text is more than enough for me), it feels very enriching to the chinese culture, as well as the cooking foods and various farming goods, the clothing and the hair styles. The translations could be a bit better, they're quite obviously a bit unwieldy in trying to be exact and I feel like I'm missing some of the subcontexts, so it could be translated better, but it's sufficient in order to enjoy the game. I also feel like I'm getting some insight into Chinese mentality and style of life - if not modern life, then at least their fantasy and medieval style. 
If I continue with the Stardew Valley comparison, I like the story here a lot better, it's a very nice and charming one. I love discovering new characters and features of the game. It is very well paced and keeps the excitement up, while still being very relaxing.

It's only been out for a few days at the time of this review, so there are still quite a few bugs, though the devs seem to be working hard to fix them, so I'm not too worried.

There is so much to do in this game! Mining, chopping, foraging, fishing, crafting, decorating, cooking, befriending, monster slaying, rebuilding, leveling, farming, and more. There isn't a moment that I have nothing to do.
Though it's important to keep up with all the main quests, if you lag behind on certain quests, you might find yourself wasting quite a bit of time catching up, though there are always other things to focus on in the meantime while you do so.

At the start of the game the instructions for how to do things are very clear, but as you get deeper in, you're expected to just figure a lot of it out yourself, which doesn't always work. On multiple occasions I've found myself a bit stuck, trying to figure out how to do things, or what to even do, though the more you play, the more familiar you get with all the mechanics and it will become second nature. But it can be hard at times when there is so much to do already, and so much to keep up with, and you find yourself struggling with new mechanics at the same time.

I love the characters, they have distinct personalities and stories, though nothing super deep, but that's okay. There could be a bit more dialogue for the daily conversations, outside of quests, they say the same thing every day. 
Actually befriending them is very slow though, giving the best gifts, talking to them daily, and inviting them for banquets progresses the friendship slowly, but I do suggest doing it, as you can get some nice rewards, including very helpful ones.

after 80+ hours:

Unfortunately, as I said previously, starting around 50 hours, it slowly starts to become more grindy, and this gets worse and worse. At 60 it was manageable, at 70 it was no longer fun, and now at 80+ I've decided to quite the game. I am very close to the end looking at the small amount of quests I have left, and where I'm at in the story, but all there is for me to do to continue at this point is grind grind grind, going into the different realms to fight, and grind on my skills to move on the the next stage, just to finish this next quest. And I have a sneaking suspicion that one of the next quests will require me to do the same, and then once more.. 
At this point there isn't really anything else to work on for me, nothing else to look forward to, just grinding cultivation. 
I now dread playing, so I decided to stop so I wouldn't end up full on hating this game that I previously loved.
Maybe the devs will change this, I doubt it.
But with a well paced game with lots to do! turning into nothing but a meaningless grind.. one can only hope.  

My conclusion: 
Is it a perfect game? Absolutely not!
Is it something new in this genre? To an extend, absolutely yes! It's not your average farming game, it's a new perspective with some new mechanics. Though purely farming wise, it doesn't stray too far from the norm, the fun comes with things like the cooking system, visiting and fighting your way through other realms, rebuilding a broken sect, and feeling like your contribution truly matters. 
Is it fun? Yes!
But! and this is a huge But! 
I suggest playing this game up until the grindy bit (unless you love a grindy game of course) 
Play until you no longer find it fun. I still got 50+ hours of fun out of this game, making it worth it in my book. So I won't give it a thumbs down. I just don't think it's worth playing till the end. 
If you're the kind of gamer that HAS to finish a game, but don't like grinding, this isn't the game for you. ",1706204595,1706776088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I came into this game with zero expectations. To me, from the trailers, it looked like a 3D Stardew Valley except with cultivators, a concept from Chinese fantasy literature. Then, I got my first ""watering can"". The difference from other farming sims was that it had unlimited water. After I watered my first tile, the characters next to me go, ""What are you doing watering tiles one at a time like a PEASANT? Here's how a CULTIVATOR waters the field!"" and teaches me how to summon a raid cloud to water everything in an AOE radius. At that point, I knew this game was gonna be good.

[h1]Pros: Graphics[/h1]

Let's talk about the things that I think stand out first. The graphics are very pleasant on the eyes. The art style is detailed and looks great. It's easily miles ahead of other farming life sims. The character art is highly detailed and each character is absolutely beautifully drawn, including the NPC's. The environments, although lowpoly, make me stop at times to just look and soak in the scenery. The item icons are very clear and concise (although some of the seeds do blend together). The cooking graphics are absolutely great, too!

[h1]Pros: Story[/h1]

This is where the majority of farming life sims fall short. They have no story other than the main character's grandfather died and left them a farm. Here, it's way different. The Guiyun Sect collapses due to a very unfortunate circumstance. You and six other sect candidates decide to take on the task of rebuilding the sect. You save one of the sect members and as he's in a coma, you constantly have to create medicines and nutritious foods for him to consume. Each person is tasked with a different aspect of the sect to rebuild. One is in charge of the market, the other is in charge of the physical rebuilding, another is to keep the local city safe, and you are in charge of the farm and management. It's way more involved than the majority of farming life sims.

[h1]Pros: Gameplay[/h1]

[h2]Farming[/h2]

The gameplay is what you expect out of a farming life sim. Plant crops, water them, harvest them, sell them, buy more seeds, repeat. However, what it does different is the way you get access to various Cultivator skills and inventions to speed up the process. There's even a Harvest Talisman that causes your entire field of crops to grow to max maturity immediately, even those out of season. This adds on a whole different level of strategy involved with how crops are to be handled. Combine that with the cultivator techniques and inventions and you start to think about strategies different from what other farming life sims do.

[h2]Battles[/h2]

Battles are different from the usual farming life sim. When I first got my wooden sword, I was thinking I was gonna be bashing monsters over the head with it. Nope. You go around shooting laser swords instead. It's akin to old school top-down shooter games like Smash TV except with Chinese Cultivators and it's very fun! You get spells and such to use for battle, too. And those are also very fun! My only complaint with battle is that some of the floors are a bit too large and there's little enemy variety with each floor in each biome, but I suppose not everything is perfect.

[h2]Cooking[/h2]

My favorite part of the game though? Cooking. This is the most involved cooking system I've ever seen in a farming life sim ever. Other farming life sims have you just have a recipe, check for ingredients, click a button, and automatically cook. Here, you actually have to bring ingredients to various stations and prepare them/cook them there while following a recipe. The recipes are all different so cooking different dishes give you a different experience, too. Not to mention they actually follow real life steps, so you can actually up your own real life cooking knowledge through this mini-game. I even took inspiration to make new dishes in real life because of this mini-game.

[h1]Pros: Characters[/h1]

[h2]Personalities[/h2]

I'm actually surprised at how well written the characters are. The sect members anyway. Each character has a deep and involved personality. I'm not talking about them having only new content when there's special events involved upon reaching certain relationship levels. That exists here, too. But instead, these characters, from time to time, give you various quests to advance the story. And when the story advances, the other characters join in, too. They're very involved in weaving the narrative this game has to offer. Each character is super distinct from each other, from the focused swordsman to the cunning yet caring merchant. I absolutely love each and every one of them, and sometimes, when they go off on missions to disappear for some time, I can't help but to miss them.

[h1]Cons: Controls[/h1]

Since I've been doing nothing but talking about the pros, let's talk about some cons. The biggest con for me are the controls. Some of the design decisions behind making the keyboard and mouse controls makes very little sense to me. Selecting tools absolutely requires you to press the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hot keys and then pressing the E button. There's no way to use the mouse's scroll wheel to quickly switch between them. This is odd to me because when using a controller, you can D-Pad around the tools in a very quick and efficient fashion but can't with the keyboard and mouse setup. It would also be nice to let tools be used with the mouse buttons (left click for E, right click for F).

Navigating menus is a bit harsh, too. In some places the Escape button goes to the previous menu and cancels out the current window. However, other places, like the cooking board in the sect does not. Certain interactions absolutely require a mouse to do with while on a controller, it uses a button that is commonly used with other keys.

Thankfully, I think these are problems that can all be fixed. By simply allowing tools to be used with mouse clicks, swapping them with the mouse wheel, etc. Allowing the escape button to function as a ""cancel"" out of each window would also be great.

[h1]Cons: Inventory Management[/h1]

There's a lot of inventory management in this game and it's easily the most tedious part of the game. While it's great that the warehouse (your primary source of storage) can be expanded to house thousands of items, it kinda sucks that you still need to take things out of it in order for them to be used. This is a common problem in the massive majority of farming life sims and it's no different here.

For things like crafting, researching, trading in resources, quests, etc. the game requires you to have them in your inventory. There's a lot of going back and forth between the warehouse and whatever requires those resources. Normally, it's not a problem to have those items in your inventory at all times, but this game gives at least three different rarities of most commonly used items (and mutations of that item, too). There's not much inventory space for the player after that so the majority of everything goes to the warehouse. That's a problem. The easiest way to fix this would be to let the player access the warehouse from afar or let the crafting, research, quests, etc. be able to take from the warehouse, too.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

This is probably the most pleasant farming life sim I've played to date. The theme changing from the usual ""grandpa leaves you a farm"" to the story-driven rebuilding of the sect is huge to me. The gameplay is very fun by making Cultivation involved with so many aspects of the gameplay loop. Cooking is fantastic. It's not a perfect game, but this game does things right more than it does wrong. And once the things that it does wrong are fixed, I wouldn't be surprised if this game becomes the next big farming life sim hit. The potential for this game is huge, too, given the roadmap the devs laid out for this game and I look forward to the future updates!",1706537189,1706537189,True,30,1,0.788569152355194092,0,True,False,False

Other than this though, I would recommend the game as it has a ton of activities to do and the gameplay loop is satisfying and doesn't feel like a grind at all. I especially love the cooking in this game as it's not just a single button click or some simple mini game but includes more of time management into it with more complex recipes. For example, setting things to boil while you cut up some other ingredients, etc. In general, it's easy to feel overwhelmed with the amount of content there is, but also there isn't really a time limit for most quests (just the seasonal billboard quests that are completely optional) so you can just take it at your own pace.

Cannot recommend in good faith even though I love this game. The main function like load save does not work. I can only use the continue game option, which means I can only play one save at a time and cannot access the older saves.

I'm so wrapped up in the main story as well as the side stories created for each person you speak with.

I would like to say one small negative is the auto cut scenes. They move quickly so it will be hard to keep up with what is said. I have not seen a way to slow it down a bit or turn that off unless I missed it, just wanted to let that be known.

It has an interesting story very different from other farm/life sims like Stardew Valley or the Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons Games while still staying true to the basics of the genre. 

Combat is a bit lacklustre but I'm not a fan of combat in these types of games anyways so that's not really a con for me and there are tons and I mean TONS of quests. There's also a sort of map in the journal section regarding the main quests so you can see which quests you can unlock and complete, and how many and which ones you've already done. 

I'm still VERY early on in the game but one thing that you should know is that there doesn't seem to be a calendar like we are used to seeing in farming sims. (At least not that I can find)  However crops seem to grow all year round with certain seasons being more productive than others so this doesn't seem to be a huge issue.

There is a sort of almanac of sorts [spoiler] which keeps track of everything you've collected and found so far, including recipes, crops, farm buildings etc. as well as telling you what you need to make each recipe and where you can find it which is extremely helpful [/spoiler]. 

Saving can also be a bit confusing because there are [spoiler] save points found throughout the world rather than a save button in the menu. You can build more of these through game play but it took me randomly interacting with one to realise what it was, the game doesn't explicitly explain them to you. It also saves whenever you sleep so the save points aren't necessary but are nice to have.[/spoiler]

Honestly if you're looking for a farm sim that isn't a clone of all the other ones out there, this is the one you want. I'm already hooked and I probably haven't even scratched the surface of everything there is to do in this game.

1st formost key remaping half assed is what id call it and keymappign is one my major ya/na factors for games along side the ability to pause. no ability to change movement from wasd so if not a qwerty keyboard? left handed wanna use arrow keys? fk u i guess? idk u can remap a few keys but the remaping doesnt carry over for every action in game that uses that key so almost pointless to let me remap it
1-6 and qrtzxc are hard coded which sucks cause i def wanna remap a few of those .

2 in game seasons. im now near end winter and i feel seasons are pointless get rid of teh changign seasons and stick to only one and gameplay wise i dont feel much would change. everything grows every season even in winter(tho the play it off as u dont get as much crop each yeild) in the woods the only diff in scavangables i detected between season is winter/spring give a diff bamboo shoot other then that i was ab;e to find teh same things in every season and i dont fish much in these games normaly but i havent detected a immediate diff in fish caught between seasons nether. so i think devs coulda just done away with changing seasons on the farm and explained it with some ancient formation bs that keep farm area perfect all year round and keep the season scenery change to the town.
this sucks cause it almost completely negates the need to plan crops acordingly as well as keep a a proper stock pile u think ull need for rest of year. its fall but need 5 of one item that only grows in spring fk np grow it anyway its fine 

3combat this one is more a prefrence thign for me as i played at inital release and much prefere the combat system they had then gave an actual challenge then compared to now its a ranged only bullet hell style fighting which only time i ever died was when i looked away from the screen for a few minutes just to easy sucks the fun out it for me turning it into just a nother collect monster drop chore

4romance i may be wrong and if so ill edit this part out but i think the traditional romance system that normaly present in these genre games simply wasnt implemented so ability to marry/dao partner no kids no real motivation to interact with folk hell other then ur sect mates other town folk have no friendship meter at all . i think i read somewere dev implemented a roomate system if u rasie friendship up enough but not marrage . dangit pick yall fav waifu/husbando woo them and have a kid is a big draw for these life sim style games  and this one taking on teh cultivation novel style i was really looking forward to see if they did marrage or dao partner 

5storage managment  just gunna go ahead and call the storage management aspect of this game trash tier at least for any one that likes tidy and organised storage in games like these im in year 2 and so far no craftable storage chests. u get one very early and another soon after unlocking r and d . other then that u just get a single warehouse that u can expand greatly to hold everything yay. except ware house was not given any thought in dev except for make it hold alot while u can hold a shit ton u can not section it off into dif unit for specific things  soon as u hit sort bam all effort gone. while this prob wont bother some ppl it will bother folk like me who like to  give each cat of things there one storage an in diff spots i.e. i just got my silk worms but dont have a chest i can put outfront of it to hold everything about them. also normaly i have dedicated stone and wood chests that i like to fill up nope cant do that nether. chests dedicated to seeds for each season well that doesnt matter cause seasons dont matter in  this game

and those my 5 major gripes with teh game lowering it score but if none them bother u at all have at er",1705857850,1705886606,False,7,0,0.459798991680145264,0,True,False,False

I love the stories of the Chinese Immortals so I was really looking forward to this from both a farming/combat sim and for the story itself. I felt like the trailer and steam screenshots were misleading. The screenshots are much crisper than the game was when I started playing. Custom character design for the playable was non-existent, the character details were fuzzy, the friends in the game looked nothing like what their character models, and the level design felt very flat. 

The game advertises that it ""works great"" with controller and although you can technically use a controller for this game, the developers made zero effort to actually integrate controller design into the game. Every tutorial was given in context of keyboard and mouse even though it was clearly detecting I was using a controller. There was also no option to change the controller button mapping and the default controller options were non-intuitive, all while keyboard and mouse could be custom configured. I think rather than listing it as ""Full Controller Support"" on the store page, it should be ""Partial Controller Support"".

I figured I could deal with the non-intuitive controller button mapping...until I got to the first combat scene. The controls were even worse than the normal game play and I ended up side shuffling and walking backwards throughout the combat level. Again, since the tutorial was all in terms of keyboard and mouse, I had no idea that I need to constantly be using the right control stick to make sure my character was facing the correct direction during combat.

For example., you use analog up and down to move through menu categories, but if you press left or right analog, it doesnt move left or right through other menu options, it acts like you press up or down again. 

Then they have programmed the confirm button to every western players cancel button. 

Well steam input exists so you can alter your controls right? Well yeah, but the onscreen button prompts in the game arent buttons! They are positions of your controller, so you will be endlessly confused if you try to mitigate their awful controller support on your own.

For starters: The farming is great! You have the option to water plants individually, or holding down and watering them all at once. It saves so much time, and honestly, part of the reason I stopped playing other farming games was because of how tedious it was, having to spend half the game day everyday, watering plants until you were far along enough to get a sprinkler.

The cave dungeon system.  Using a flying sword and being able to have the pickaxe still equipped is a great move. It's non random so far it appears, so the layout stays the same. 

The cooking system is so cool. Being on a timer, and running around putting ingredients where they're supposed to be. very good!

The fishing is very enjoyable, so big ups for that.

I'll leave my original review from 2022 below, but I wanted to add an update to reflect the current state of the game upon it's exit from early access. I'll be brief:

Buy. This. Game.

It is a masterpiece. I don't say that lightly. I've been playing and following development since the first day it hit Steam, and the dedication and devotion the team behind this game have demonstrated has been a masterclass in how to make early access a working model.

And the price is criminally low. This should be a $30 game. Easily. It could be a $60 game -- it's that good. If you even think you might enjoy playing Immortal Life, do yourself a solid and grab it today: hundreds and hundreds of hours of happiness await.


Original Review from 2022:
I have fallen in love with this game. First of all, it is breathtakingly beautiful. I've never seen a prettier game. The addition of Cultivation (Google is your friend if you aren't familiar with the concept) to the traditional farming sim is a brilliant idea and the team behind Immortal Life have clearly thought deeply about how best to blend the two practices. The cooking mini-game alone is fantastic and super fun.

The English translation is still a bit of a work in progress, but I'm seven hours in and haven't run across anything related to translation that would impede my progress. It takes a little poking around to understand how certain mechanics work, so if you get frustrated easily or do silly things like read instructions before assembling furniture, you may be a bit out of your depth. That said, I haven't come across a single aspect of the game I wasn't able to figure out without outside help.

This is obviously an Early Access game, so a number of mechanics aren't fully fleshed out and without a wiki (at least in English) you find yourself flying blind a bit, but everything about the gameplay makes it worthwhile. If you enjoy farming/mining/fighting/cooking games, can handle a few EA-wrinkles, and have an open mind interested in learning about an important aspect of Chinese culture, you will love Immortal Life.",1651244338,1705582436,True,6,2,0.509624361991882324,0,True,False,True

I've been searching for a game similar to Stardew for a long while, that gave me the same joy that playing it for the first time did, and I have to say this game is the closest I've found.

To start things off; the npcs have some depth. While not as deep as say a narrative-driven rpg, they definitely are deeper than those in many other games in the genre.
The 'cave' levels with battles have some variations aside from your average randomly generated maps. These maps are set in stone, the resources are somewhat rng, but it does allow for good head empty grinding when you want.
The fishing game is more like animal crossing than stardew, which I appreciate immensely. 
There are other minigames that you can do to create things to help you in your adventure, too! Once you get the hang of them, they are a nice break from the routine.

There are several npc stories that are incorporated, or were in the time of the EA days, to the main story- which was very nice to see. You might have to progress affection and personal story of some npcs to progress in the main line, which was a nice turn in my opinion for this genre.

On top of that- this game is a decent starting point for Chinese fantasy mythology and mechanisms. Even if you don't know the first thing about Xianxia (immortal hero tales) or Wuxia (martial hero tales) settings, you will probably be able to pick it up fairly quickly. 

It is a very cute game, and if you like the stardew-esque genre... I would definitely say give it a try! I like this game a bit more than stardew even, because of the variations of what all you can do and the story behind it is more driven than the other. While it was linear when I played through it (there were some changes from EA to official release, and I haven't played through the official release yet) - it still is very wholesome and has more depth than I've come to expect from these types of games. As someone who also loves deep lore and rpg settings.. I definitely appreciate the labors and efforts that the writers and devs of this game put into its creation!

- Wouldn't say the characters are great as of now, but I haven't gotten sick of reading the messages they send me or interacting with them in general.

Cons:
- Controller will need remapping (the buttons weren't correct for me) and is annoying to use at times
- English translation is a lot better than most but still needs work to flow more naturally
- Would benefit from an onscreen toggle map
- Have encountered a few bugs that required me to close the game such as being stuck in the cave tutorial and a a dialog box not closing. Hopefully these get sorted out with the official release which is coming out soon.
- Text can be hard to read at times and would benefit from an outline

Despite all the cons I've listed, it's so much fun and I highly recommend.",1704907456,1704907456,True,21,2,0.637757956981658936,0,True,False,True

Befriending seems surprisingly slow/difficult; I'm in winter but I only half 1/4th of a single heart with the people I've been chatting with every day. I'd also like to see a romance option (as well as the platonic/roommates option) with the ability to date/marry someone regardless of their sex/gender. (Which I know is fine with a Chinese game because MXTX is a thing and it's extremely popular in both China and overseas.)

One problem I have is that the dialogue is the same every single day when you talk to characters. I've come across some bugs as well, but saving and restarting the game fixes them.

My biggest complaint is that some of the SFX are gods awful, like the attack SFX (R2 button) and the menu navigation SFX are the worst ones so far. I also dislike that SFX, ambiance, and vocal sounds are are all lumped together in ""SFX"" in the settings. I've had to turn off SFX cuz the attack and menu are so jarring for me, but I miss out on a lot as a result.
 
I'm struggling with a couple of things gameplay wise as well, but I suspect that's a me-thing.

One suggestion I have for controller settings is to allow us change the controller mapping. 
Edit: I recommend making L2 be the toggle for the left side menu swapper for the short menu that allows you to switch through your tools, and R2 being the toggle for the right side of the menu swapper (for the items) and allow them to scroll back to the beginning after reaching the end of each side respectively. As it is now, I have to use the arrow keys to go through both sides of the short menu and it's tedious and time consuming. I bring this up because I think that'd need special programming and not be possible through custom mapping on its own.

The menu for controller should also get changed. Instead of analogue being for categories and directionals for being the content, it should be directionals for the entire menu. Example: clicking the interact button for the menu can being you into the content area and allow you to continue using directionals. Clicking the cancel button can bring you back to the main category. Clicking Cancel again will close the menu as per normal.

With these suggestions, magic and attack should get changed to L1 and L2 as I don't think those are really in use yet.

There are a couple of hiccups, but I am playing under alpha. I also play with a controller. All tutorials are based on keyboard and mouse instructions, so if you play with a controller you have to figure it out yourself. In the cave your player faces one direction, I just figured out after many hours into the game that the right stick can change the direction of the player. I still can't figure out how to use the spells using the controller. There are some things that haven't been translated into English yet, so I have no idea what it says. I would really enjoy it if the quest gave you some direction on how to obtain the items (maybe if you click thee item picture in the actual quest?).

Great things:
Great game play.  Every activity is fun, with some fresh takes on fishing, cooking, etc.  The writing and translation are top-notch.  It's also very pretty.   I am so sick of pixel graphics, so these beautiful landscapes are refreshing.  Good quality of life too.  For example, each map section shows a list of what characters are on that part, and clicking their name in the list spots them on the map.  There's no penalty for staying up late, but your character recovers less stamina and magic... this gives flexibility to balance a bit more activity vs recovering.  Inventory management is good, with a short cut to move stuff between backpack and warehouse and auto-sort.  (I used keyboard and mouse, and didn't try controller.) Quest tracking is good and clear and chill once you realize that they're going to ask for something else as soon as you do one thing.  (Thanks for rebuilding that pier for me to fish at.  Now can you rebuild my house?)  There's some voice acting (in Mandarin or Cantonese I guess) which is cool.  Another great thing is that the notes keep track for you of who likes what gift and FISH.  Krill are caught at such and such location, at night, in all seasons, for example.  These notes auto update as you give gifts and catch fish... simple, but what a great feature!  

Not so great yet:  breakthroughs, friendships, and frantic days. 

 The breakthrough process is how your character levels up.  It requires several things to be in place that aren't at all apparent, so I'm hoping the in-game will add checklists or quest progression to help with that.  (There is a really good steam guide in English for now.)   It's a very slow process as is, and frustrating to bottleneck without the guide.  Not a deal breaker, just read that part of the steam guide carefully.

Friendships.  Conversation and gift giving works great, but after doing all that and being MVP of the group for 6 seasons, I have yet to progress past ""nodding acquaintance""/1 heart with anyone.  OK, that's really slow progress, or these people are really reserved, so I'd like that to go faster.  

Frantic Days.  There is a day/night and calendar cycle, which are well done.  (Ok, check world -calendar for where you are in the season and how many days are left.)  But each day is a little too short, leaving me feeling frantic to run home each night, often with lots of stamina left without eating anything to restore it.   It would be cool to add a way to adjust the real time of in-game days for a more chill pace.

Anyway, totally worth your money and playing for hours and hours.  (I've played through 6 seasons, mostly offline.)

Good:
- Art. the art style and graphics are lovely with barely any hiccups. Character designs are pretty. I like the variety of plants that are familiar to the farming sim community but also new crops I haven't heard of previously. 
- Story. I was intrigued by the story, and was motivated to fulfill the quests in order to find out more and progress. I also like that it has an eastern aesthetic with xianxia/wuxia elements instead of the usual ""you-inherit-a-farm-and-it's-dilapidated"" which is also fun don't get me wrong.
- Core mechanics. I like that it feels different and unique, I can summon a cloud to water my crops, for instance.

Mid:
- Character interactions. At times, I really like exploring other characters' background story, some of them have really compelling stories, while others feel very shallow. I think this is something that has a lot of potential and will certainly be expanded upon going forward. What I also hope is that I can romance my favorite characters in the future. 
- Controls. It works most of the time, however, it can be clunky and even freezes sometimes. For example, I could not switch tools by pressing keyboards, I had to manually click on the tools so that I can use them. 
- Triggering certain events. It is not very transparent, so you either have to be lucky, or read a guide in order to find out about certain events. These events are important to story progression, and while I was able to trigger most of them without any help, my story progress was slowed down due to this. 

Bad:
- Breakthrough. Some like the challenge, but I personally do not it. I wish we can decide on the difficulty. Like I previously mentioned, the controls could be clunky and less intuitive at times, and the battle system is actually not bad, but I just don't like it.

Immortal Life does things like that better than Stardew for a player like me, and its developers' dedication to staying in communication with their fans in spite of the language barrier is something to be praised.

I really like all the characters so far and their little quirks just make them seem more real, the only other one with relatable characters I can think of is Stardew.
 
There are 3 things that keep me from playing more of Immortal Life however. One is the map, and the camera. They seem kind of clunky. Honestly I don't even use the map most times, I just go wherever based on memory. But I only go to two places the river to fish, and to buy seeds, so it works...for now. If we get more places to go and explore, memorizing the design of wherever it is we need to go probably won't be possible. So please can that be fixed? As for the camera, it seems stationary...like it's mounted on it's stand and stuck. So we haul it around with lots of effort. It's a bit sad, because the valley is beautiful and the village is charming, and I'd love to explore but it's hard for me to enjoy exploring with when all we see is a few tiles in front of us...I'm not sure if it's a bigger problem the developers need to look into or my laptop aging badly. This is just my experience. The third issue is definitely a me problem, and that's the display/graphics: I get motion sick from it, after about an hour of play. And while I know my laptop is getting old, it's not THAT old yet: I play Genshin Impact regularly on it, and it works fine: no loud fans, no motion sickness. Maybe look into it?

It also scratches an itch for cultivation games and fandom I've had since discovering MXTX's works this past spring.    The music is so calming, the characters are fun, and the story and backgrounds are so interesting!  

I've encountered a few bugs.  One common one makes my character look like he's sliding instead of walking when he enters a new area, but that's not game breaking   Twice I've had where the game won't let me interact after loading a new scene, but a restart fixes that.  It's also crashed back to desktop twice in the 33 hours I've played.  A few things (such as Chen's House) don't have English translations yet, but the game is still Early.   The attention to detail and the fun discoveries make this game playable and enjoyable even with these errors.

Other than some minor bugs you would never know this is an early access game. This is the best farming sim I have played since Stardew Valley. In some ways, this is a better game though it's hard to match the magic of Stardew. I'm baffled as to why games like Wylde Flowers, which feels like a converted mobile game, is rated higher than this lovely feature packed gem.

WORKS GREAT ON STEAM DECK
As of the 0.9.0 update in July, this game works well on the Steam deck which I play this on almost exclusively. Saves work without issue (just need to make sure cloud saves are enabled in steam deck general settings which it should be by default). The only issue is when you enter your character name at the beginning you will need to bring up the steam deck keyboard to enter in your name. Only time I have needed to fuss with the game and it's a quick work around to use the steam overlay keyboard. I just manually assigned one of the back triggers to keyboard in the controller settings and unassigned it right after. 

GRAPHICS
Immortal Life's graphics are lovely and remind me of the early Rune Factory games in style but more detail rich. The costumes and accessories are fun and collect at a steady rate. The animations are quick and don't feel agonizingly slow like in other games such as Wylde Flowers (cute game that deliberately slowed things down and made ridiculously low drop rates to artificially extend the game and hide lack of content which a dev essentially admitted as much in steam forums  >:(  ).  

CONTENT
This game has a lot of content. I was truly surprised at how much there is to do especially for an early access game.  I haven't even finished an in-game year and I already have plans to replay and try for an optimized run. Got to complete certain quests to unlock characters and areas and I want to try unlocking them all in year 1! Every season you get new board requests and  random bulk orders for the wandering merchant. There are lots of side quests that come regularly and character requests as you build your affection levels. Not to mention the main story quests focusing on rebuilding the sect with lots of quests to gather materials to rebuild all the different buildings, unlock facilities, help R&D new products to sell in the sect store, and recruit wandering cultivators to teach after rebuilding the lecture hall. Currently, there are 69 different crops, 83 cooking recipes, 64 alchemy elixirs, 21 facilities, 59 fish to catch, 670 different pieces of furniture, and lots of materials, ingredients and monsters. Lots of content to play with at whatever pace you want. 

STORY
This game probably has one of the best stories for a life/farm sim that I have played. The Xianxia (fantasy martial arts cultivating to become immortal) flavor is unique to the genre and really spices things up.  The circumstances leading your character to farm doesn't feel contrived and the character relations really add to the story and motivation to rebuild the sect. I really like that the other members show active participation in rebuilding the sect and regularly support and acknowledge your characters efforts. Get lots of letters (enchanted flying origami cranes) with useful and story relevant items from fellow sect members that really help and make me appreciate them more. Also, bless Ji Yaohua and her generous gifts of money!

BALANCE
The game already feels well balanced and it's not even finished. Often these types of games are unbalanced with some clear game breaking strategies that, while fun to discover, can easily suck the challenge and fun out of a game. While there are money making strategies I have yet to find any that give a significant advantage. It's better to cook and craft with most crops rather than sell directly. Cooking is actually utilized properly and encourage players to actually cook!!! I often feel cooking is a tack on feature in most sims with minimal utility. I cook regularly in this game and always keep some cooked food in my inventory for stamina regen, buffs, and gifts. I like that the game is balanced in a way to gently encourage strategic selling/hoarding. Do you sell all your crops to have a larger cash flow but delay your quest progression or do you hoard your crops/materials for faster quest progression but struggle more with money? I love that I consciously have to plan out my focus for each season instead of mindlessly farm, harvest, sell. 

OVERALL
I highly recommend! I have had the game for less than a week and already have 40 hours playtime. While it's not catching me as hard as Stardew (practically an addiction) it's got me pretty hooked. I recommend this game to any farm sim fan especially Rune Factory fans.",1691695197,1691698310,True,4,0,0.53674924373626709,0,True,False,True

(original review time 102+ hours)
Its a fun game with the potential to be great. 
There are some bugs in places and it still has to finish main story but with every patch and content added the game becomes more vibrant.
The farming is a little slow and tedious at first but as you upgrade like any game it gets better.
The scenery, artwork and music add a lovely unique feel and I look forward to seeing what else they add to the game as they develop.
You can only level up so many times in Early access at the moment so after maxing everything out if you don't like the idea of farming, fishing etc and it not counting towards next level maybe take a break and come back the game after they add more level ups.
I look forward to seeing how the main story goes.

600+ hours they updated the stories and it keeps getting better. There are more level ups and many more areas to explore, fight and gather resources from.

Farming is actually pretty easy and most crops have a much shorter timescale compared to other games in the genre. This could be because each season/month is only 18 days. Bonus, you get the ability to make irrigation wells fairly early, including automatic ones, and you start off with a spell that lets you do mass watering. Very convenient. Crops are not season locked, you just get reduced yield for harvesting out of preferred season. There's different crop qualities from C, G, S and a final legendary crop with a different name and appearance. You can get different quality from a single harvest (e.g., 2 c, 1 g from a non-repeating crop like wheat or carrots). You eventually unlock the ability to research even more crop types.
The fishing minigame for non-legendaries is pretty standard - watch for the bobber to sink while the fish nibbles. There's an audible difference between nibbles and sinking, so that's useful.
Relationships are built by talking daily, gifting and quests. There's also banquets later which are a great way to boost everyone's affection at once. Romance isn't implemented yet, but the characters all have distinct personalities and warm up to you at different rates. Some have quests you have to complete before recruiting them which can take a while to complete.
Cooking is a very different minigame that feels much more involved and time sensitive than any other game I've played. You have a bunch of different stations that you have to carry ingredients to, do that station's action and then move on to either the next station or the plating/serving area when you're done.
Gathering/foraging is done on the ""solar cycle"" system. Each solar cycle is three days long, there are six of them in a season. You can kind of think of them as very short weeks? Each solar cycle the forageable ingredients pop up and the shops refresh their stock and change what's on sale - shop sales are very RNG based but they can be a way to get certain items (especially seeds) early before you unlock them.
Combat is pretty much mouse based. While aiming with tools is done based on WASD (and thus, whichever direction your character is facing), combat has your character face the mouse cursor. Left click is default sword attack, right click for spells. I have definitely wasted spells because I forgot to actually face the proper direction first. Do better than me.
Music is pretty soothing, this is one of the few games where I actually keep the sound on instead of catching up on my audiobooks and podcasts. Great for the game, bad for my backlog. It really adds to the atmosphere and immersion.
The game isn't finished yet and while it's got some bugs, I haven't found anything gamebreaking yet. I am a chronic restarter, so most of my experience is with early game (I always believe I can do a more efficient playthrough and then I end up restarting). This game is pretty generous to constant restarters like me - you have multiple character saves and each one keeps track of previous saves so you can just rewind a couple of days instead of making a new character every time. Possibly my most used feature.
Also, while you can't customize your character off the bat (other than choosing to play male or female) you gain access to new hair styles, clothing and accessories as the game goes on. I enjoy the designs but feel that the accessories reflect my character the most (I used to have a floating leaf sprite following me around, and then a toy duck and now it's just a cooling pinwheel for summer). They're all just for aesthetics, no mechanical benefit. Stats are increased by [spoiler]taking classes[/spoiler] and eating certain items. You do upgrade your tools, of course, but it's more about getting higher quality materials than anything to do with your stats.
I personally have problems making money because I have a hoarding mentality and don't sell my stuff until I need to for a quest. Related, you don't ship things, you sell them to merchants - it doesn't appear in their inventory afterward so you won't be able to buy back what you sold.",1689700444,1689700444,True,9,0,0.6192893385887146,0,True,False,True

This game reminds me of Harvest Moon: Sunshine Islands and Story of Seasons where you have to fix things to get more features. It has a changing area that progresses, the farming system is decent though I wish it had a few more tool tips. The fishing is fairly enjoyable, so is the mining. Um, I honestly love the cooking game not going to lie! Anyways, this is still very early access and I find that it has some good playability, but it is still pretty new and a work in progress. The English translations are pretty on point though!

So, my issues with the game are mild. Immensely so. The art style while beautiful all in all...just doesn't fit well with a lot of the elements of the game. There are parts that just have me blank staring as the art is pretty, but does not fit with the layout of the game. My biggest complaint is the UI and Menu just don't reflect how nice the layout of the land is. Then there is a lack of a sprint button which I'd rather enjoy as the walk speed is a little slow. Besides that, the game is absolutely playable and may require some time to get into. The artwork is pretty and the game itself is pretty simple which makes it a nice cozy game. As I said before, wish the UI and Menu just meshed better...maybe some new icons for items too in order to better fit.

Take My Time at Portia, remove the open world, make the apocalypse localized in a world with magic, and give yourself some helpful friends as you rebuild. If that sounds as badass to you as it did to me? Buy this game. It's worth every penny. 

Now for deeper thoughts: 

The art manages to be both stunningly gorgeous and rudimentary. For the backgrounds, the vegetables, the fish, etc. -- everything is worth stopping and staring at, at least a little. For the people you're supposed to be making happy... well, again, that first look is stunning, but there's no real change for emotional moments. These people are happy and raring to go even when their world is falling apart. Still, though, I can't say I actually mind that for Chen. *koff*

Controls are easy, except when they're a bear. You *will* learn to keep your mouse aimed on the monsters even though you're using WASD to direct your character. You will learn or you will watch your character die miserably as she pirouettes and flails with her sword no matter how many times you *think* you've aimed her at a monster. Still, this isn't a rogue-like or anything like that. You don't lose money or items when you die, thank goodness.

*** Edit one year in: Controls are a *lot* better, except where they're not. Combat is still a pain in my natural Black *** -- they've made things more challenging without improving much more than the jankiness of the controls. Still...***

At least in early access, the monster hunting is a little stale. There are only a few kinds of monsters that I've seen. and, because of grinding, you have to see them over and over for a while. Not a fan.

Grind level is, at this point... hmm... moderate. Nowhere near as bad as a mobile game, but still feels like more than I'm used to allowing because of the lack of open world. 

***Edit: For the resources it's necessary to perform combat for? Grind-level can be arduous. I just loathe the combat in this game to *death*, and only the beauty and wonder of literally everything else keeps me coming back.***

Translation into English? Pretty exceptional, actually -- where it's there. And it *does* seem to be there for all the important places I've found. Still, there are some buttons that, when pressed, make one wish the American public school education were somewhat broader in scope. 

***Edit: Translation still absent in a few places, but, again, nowhere desperately important.***

Magic! *This* kind of magic in a farming sim! How cool is that shit???

Cooking is more management-oriented than chill meditation -- you have a certain amount of time to get a perfect score, and if you don't make it, your dishes' quality goes down accordingly -- and that was quite disappointing to me. I absolutely adore zoning out over a toon stove in these games, and, after re-playing Garden Paws recently, I was looking forward to a game with more interesting recipes. This game provides wonderful recipes whose ingredients are just the right kind of challenging to produce/acquire, and, to my surprise, the cooking mini-game is pretty fun, too. 

Once you get the rhythm of it, there *is* a certain meditative quality to it -- though I absolutely love the option to quick cook (automatically cook) dishes after they've been cooked perfectly.

***Edit: You will gaze in terrified wonder at these recipes if you're a Westerner. It's glorious. I'm learning new things to try.***

Quests are still quests -- either you like this sort of thing or you don't. Though I've noticed that, while new quests go up on the board as various quests get fulfilled, old quests stay up to give the character a chance to level up enough to *do* them. 

Leveling up, in general, is not that hard -- you do so with *all* your activities around the sect, not just demon-hunting, which I thought was quite cool -- and there's a neat little scene that happens as you fight for your 'breakthrough'. (Read more comics, you'll get it.) 

And that's about all I have for now. There was a lot of criticism in this review, but keep in mind that this game is in EA, and the devs have been doing a *huge* amount of bug-smashing and QOL improvements since release a week and a half or so ago. 

They're responding to every bug report on steam, at this point, and I'm pretty sure they're handling things well on their discord, as well. I feel this was an excellent investment. But more than that?

***Edit: I doubt things will improve much for the combat at this late date, but I know there are things coming down the pike for this game that will *absolutely* keep me playing for months to come. Just... perhaps not obsessively. I still haven't finished the currently-available content.***

When I played the demo about two weeks ago, my eyes were as wide as saucers and I was giggling like a child. I had never even imagined a game like *this* could happen with subject matter like *this*. Two great tastes, eh? 

And they *do* taste wonderful together, and the full release is even better, even richer, even more colorful and bright and beautiful. 

There is a *lot* to do in this world, and so much to see -- even without the open world. 

This is more than worth your money, and I, personally, would've happily paid a full 10 USD more. 

Buy it.

***Edit: This is, actually, still true. It's a farm sim for people into cultivation stories. It's Portia with magic. It's a love letter to fantasy and *food*. it's a glorious game, even with all my criticism, and it's worth every penny and then some. My issues? Will almost certainly not be *yours*.***",1652116733,1686095348,True,10,0,0.607454955577850342,0,True,False,True

So far the game is super cute and I really love it. It's got a good story and as long as you know how to pace yourself it shouldn't take you more than two in-game years to really get into the content. 

My Thoughts:

Farming system - if you like to play games like ""Harvest Moon"" ""Story of Seasons"" and ""Stardew Valley"" this game will make you happy.

Crafting system - You can use the stuff you harvest and farm to create useful things. Certain craft-ables are very important (Such as the warehouse. Don't put off building it.) In order to get the kitchen you need to complete quests related to Mu. 

Cultivation system - If you like wuxia/xianxia style fantasy and culture this is awesome. Actually one of the main reasons I bought this game since I already play many farming and rural life simulation games. You can break through foundation after you've completed a good amount of storyline.

Town Building - You can't choose where to place buildings but you can restore buildings that used to be in the sect before you arrived and it was destroyed. You can also pick the lectures that occur at the lecture hall once every three days. This can help you target things you need to improve on. There are many options for decorating your own home as well, and completing quests can get you some nifty decor items. 

Dungeon Areas - You can fight monsters and farm resources! The dungeon system has been revamped several times and it's currently sitting at not-terribly-challenging but not super-easy if you're farming dungeons that suit your level. The first two you open up will get easy long before you open up the others.  You can complete quests at whatever pace you like, but many functions and useful things remain unavailable until you reach certain points in the storyline.

Wilderness area - You can harvest lumber and bamboo as well as foraging for wild herbs. There is a mysterious woman living in the forest who you can befriend once you've spoken with her enough. 

Friendship - You can befriend the other potential sect members and some of the townsfolk. They send you letters and gifts every now and then. I'm sure there will eventually be a romance option. 

Battle - Combat is pretty balanced now in my opinion. The monsters become more challenging as you are given access to new areas. Elixirs that help with things like travel speed become more important in later dungeons. 

Story Progression - The story progresses as quickly as you work for it. You'll need a lot of ginseng in the beginning of the main quest so I suggest burning all the money you have during the summer on tomato seeds. Do Not Sell your ginger when you first grow it. You'll need it for quests. Even the left overs. You'll need a lot of rare potato after unlocking the large irrigation systems so keep that in mind for fall because progressing through the story can cost a lot, and the irrigation systems help to cut down on the time you spend on your plants every day while maintaining your ability to grow and harvest an abundance of crops. Many quests in the early days can be completed using items that your sect-mates give you. Hold on to them if you can afford to.  
 
Cultivation limit - I don't know what the current cultivation limit is. I've advanced to foundation and will continue until I've discovered the new cap. There is a soft limit on cultivation once you reach the peak meditation stage because you have to complete storyline to loosen your 'bottleneck' and make it to Foundation.

Conclusion - The game has a lot to offer and though it isn't finished yet, it is worth the investment. The developers care about this game, and it really shows. I love the art style and the storyline. Most of the bugs I've encountered have been resolved, though there are still some issues with targeting and using the irrigation systems when watering your fields, or when trying to rearrange them. There are also some small issues targeting cooking ingredients when cooking in the sect kitchen. Sometimes I have to step away and walk back to the thing I'm attempting to interact with before the action becomes available. 

Thank you to the developers who are working hard to complete this game. You've created something worth playing! I can't wait to see it finished.",1658005825,1682935298,True,38,0,0.800152182579040527,0,True,False,True

28.04.2023 edit, 25h in
Overall a very promising title, with frequent updates. (edit)
[h1]Positives:[/h1]
- Beautiful 2D art, pleasant art style.
- Story, writing, characters.
- Farming system, spell system, crafting system, alchemy system. (edit)
- Useful decoration system linked to recovery.
- Unique cooking minigame.
- Unique stat progression system. (edit)
- Frequent updates. (edit)
- In-game notes and library tab (a discovery based mini wiki) (edit)
[h1]Negatives:[/h1] (a bit nitpicky, as I believe such feedback is useful in an early access version)
- Clunky movement.
- Clunky UI.
- Clunky 3D graphics.
[h1]Specific points for improvement:[/h1]
[b]Clunky movement.[/b]
- No acceleration/deceleration/elasticity of movement, feels too stiff.
- No ability to change jump direction midair - while logical IRL, in-game makes movement clunky. Sometimes leads to jumping in place instead of forward.
[strike]- Somewhat connected - inability to hold button for continued use of hoe/seeds/harvest/etc.[/strike] - ""fixed"" later in game with [spoiler] special spells for each [/spoiler] (edit)
- Clunky targeting - sometimes it is impossible to target something if you stand behind it, especially in areas where the camera is lower to the ground (forest). Sometimes it is hard to target a specific object. Sometimes the targeting will not detect an object at all/flicker over it. (edit)
[b]Clunky UI.[/b]
- No settings menu in Main Menu.
- All audio and video settings grouped into two big categories. A more customizable approach would be appreciated.
- Non-uniform use of Esc key to close/exit UI elements.
- PC specific - inventory and other UI elements with listed items do not respond to cursor hovering - this leaves the game feeling unresponsive. Bonus points for the ability to browse the items using WSAD.
- In-game references to hotkeys (""Press x to do y"") do not change with your personalized hotkeys.
- (No camera controls - at the very least zooming in or out. Then again, I understand the choice to not implement this)
- No targeting indicator for tools (outside of hoe), again, makes the game feel less responsive, makes the targeting issues mentioned earlier on that much more prominent. (edit)
- (Something I would appreciate - the ability to ""save"" into my notes what building I am planning on building, so I can check what materials I will need while away from the Renovation Division.) (edit)
[b]Clunky 3D graphics.[/b]
This point speaks for itself. And while this game is too far along the development phase to change much about this particular issue, I still feel like I should at least mention this.
While the choice for more hand-drawn feel in the 2D aspects of this game is great, it does not translate well into the 3D parts. The mismatch between the big texture resolution (ground texture, architecture etc.) and the resolution of any smaller objects (flora, miscellaneous objects) in particular. Which is something that could well be fixed simply with a change in the rendering set up.
[h1] ??? [/h1] (edit)
[b] Time speed [/b]
Not sure how to preface this one, nor where to put it in this review.
Time speed (length of day, duration of crafting etc.) is... very well done? At first I had wanted to put it in negatives, as it felt too fast. I was always rushing. The days were always that lil' bit too short. But then as I progressed, I realised I never fell short. I always hit those milestones, whatever they might have been (quests, lessons, builds...). It was always just right. So clearly, considering this aspect, good job dev team!
However - and this is a more personal issue of mine (mostly stemming form my attention disorder) - this constant rush felt sometimes a bit too stressful, and not the good kind of stressful. I found myself spending a good chunk of game in my inventory, time paused, so I could backtrack in my thought process and make sure I did not forget what I was doing, that I took everything I needed for my trip to the town etc.

It's a lot of fun, with extremely charming visuals, and now that saves are able to be fixed, it plays like a dream on Deck.

----‐--------------------------------

I love this game, I really do. But I can't recommend it as of right now, because there is a huge game-breaking issue that the devs seemingly have no intentions of fixing. If you are on Steam Deck, you CANNOT save the game. At all. Saves will always fail, and when you exit the game and load it back up, sure enough, all progress is wiped. 

It's a shame, because it would be the perfect game for Steam Deck; performance is otherwise perfect, and controls work well with minimal adjustments. I had fun playing it for a short while before I realised that this was an issue; at which point, I stopped playing and uninstalled it. I really hope that this will get fixed one day, but if you're looking for good games for Steam Deck, steer well clear of this one.",1681155512,1682111122,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, the biggest problem I found would be the sequence of the story. For example, I believe making Song Yantong a member of Sector was supposed to happen before Mu Xia becoming a sector member too, because we can see Song Yantong in the welcoming party. While, when Song Yantong becomes the sector member, we don't see Mu Xia with in the party. We can say the same thing when Xie Wentian wakes up. For a couples of days, after he woke up I didn't have anything to do (and if I didn't know any better, I would've thought that was as far as you developed the game). Just after I decided to pass the time in the hopes of finding some trigger in the story and after some ""pre-missions"" Icould start the mission of Song Yantong and then making her a member. So in summary, I make Mu Xia a member of the sector first, then wake up Xie Wentian and just then I finally make Song Yantong a member. Just then it activated the next mission where Xie Wentian start to get stronger enough to talk with the others. 

With that, I believe you should review some pre-requirements for the missions, like i should first make Song Yantong a member, then after that I can make Mu Xia a member and then I get the last mission to make Xie Wentian wake up from his slumber. The same I can say with the how we improve the relationships with the other members, maybe we could just improve until a certain point and then be blocked because we need to do some missions before to start improve again (Maybe you could block the option of giving presents when that happen or making another thing indicating that it the heart points won't go up until some we finish some mission, like the special mission after we get another stage in the relationships). 

This is how far I played the game, but I hope that my suggetions and review help you guys in the development of the game.  This kind of game of sectors, cultivation and immortality with the farmer and life simulator is game I wanted to find for some time and I'm really happy with all your amazing work.

The gist of it, as I'm understanding it after seemingly making some real progress, is that it puts a lot more emphasis on its equivalent of Stardew Valley's restoring the community center. You've gotta restore a Cultivation Shrine.Whereas in Stardew, I felt more inclined to do my own thing and any progress in the town and with the quest log was incidental, Immortal Life really makes me want to put everyone else first. My routine is one of working towards long term goals such as repairing/constructing shrine buildings while regularly picking off low-hanging fruit from the quest log.I'm 30 hours in, according to this review panel, and I haven't yet paid much attention to bettering myself for its own sake. In Stardew, my first decision was typically, what money maker would said farm theme and build itself around, and then I'd spend upwards of five game years pretty much ignoring the community while I assembled the financial foundation for the game that would make completing everything else trivial.In this game, I've really done no such thing, just blasting out task after task as they come, and viewing the eventual chance to perfect my property aesthetics as something of a retirement goal once I've effectively completed the game.I don't know that this constant pressure would lend itself to being my favorite in genre, but because of the cultivation foundation at the game's core, it all just works. I'm happy that Immortal Life triggered an interest in the Xianxia/Cultivation genre.My wife previously watched this Chinese serial drama Legend of Fuyao on a streaming service, and it was always pretty interesting, but I didn't go all in on it. That might have to change. I'll be seeing what else is good in the theme. Steam seems to have two others of interest.

I love farming sims, played every Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, and Rune Factory that has come out, until this year. I sold my Switch because so far all of them have been (to me) disappointing. They lack what the original Harvest Moons had, relaxing calming enjoyable but still rewarding gameplay. The new ones are complicated and drawn out to me seems stressful. Having to move my farm, numerous processors, or travel to a different biome, plus the relationships all seemed so cookie cutter, and boring. I just felt more stressed than I wanted, decided I was done with them for now. There are so many new good farm sims with decent or better relationship building. This is one of those and it's not even done. 

This game is beautiful with even better background music. There is a decent amount to customize in your house, you, and the farm, plus I am sure more to come. The characters sure, have one-liners just like all other games, but the Paper Cranes add this connection to it that I enjoy. Character building and friendship too. 

It's complicated enough to keep me interested but not so much I am looking at guides or googling things or just feeling overwhelmed by it all. There is plenty to do! But I don't find myself going Oh man I have to get this done this season or I'm screwed till next year! As a lot of Farm Sims do, this one the seasons aren't as long and the days do go by quickly, so I never feel like I missed something even if I did. It will loop around quickly!

It is unique as well with its Sect building and fighting there too. 

So far my only feedback would be to disable Auto Dialogue, certain cut scenes go by so quickly and I'm like wait what just happened? I couldn't read it all before it was gone! 
Also, slightly longer days would be nice. But then again, it forces you to manage what you do and when you do it because there isn't enough time to do it all.

As for the positive, I really like that the relationships with other characters takes a lot of time and effort. It feels rewarding and more natural in the sense that you have to take the time to learn about a person to grow closer to them. Most farming sims rush the relationships too much, where they use these big moments to advance the relationship. But that's not how relationships work.

Things of note: [b]You cannot play this on the steam deck.[/b] I actually tried playing for like 30 hours not realizing it wasn't actually saving. Man was that surprising when I stopped and then tried to access my save file. Also from some online research, it does not seem like they will be supporting save files on the steam deck. So learn from my mistake!

I really love this game because it combines Chinese wuxia with my favorite kind of game -  a farming sim. Normally, most wuxia games I have tried tend to be more geared towards the fighting aspect, so this game was a pleasant surprise. I love the cooking mini game as it is very engaging compared to just kind of throwing everything into one pot. It is a very interesting story line as well. You have to restore a sect from ruins instead of just being a part of an already functioning and large sect. The fighting mechanic is pretty fun and not too complicated. I do enjoy the character backgrounds, however at times it can either be super slow since some things are quest locked or seem super rushed. I kind of wish there was actually a better way to learn what gifts your fellow sect members love since there was a precedent with one of the first people you can invite to join the sect. However, I've found myself defaulting to what I normally do in these kinds of games, which is to consult a guide. Some gifts make sense like the fisherman really likes some kinds of fish, but others I really want to know why those items they like. Overall, I am very happy about how this game combines wuxia and farming sim mechanics and acknowledge that it can be a bit grindy, but I'm used to that. I definitely would recommend this game to anyone else who likes farming sims.

Just a gorgeous crafter with satisfying, surprisingly deep crafting mechanics that hosts a feeling of joy and accomplishment.  Cooking is my favorite.

The Inn kitchen is something that would add functionality to the player's base beyond cosmetic decor that only adds sleeping stat recovery bonuses. I just don't feel like spending a whole lot of time at home in this homesteading game.  #3 Inventory descriptions.  The player can alter their appearance with hair styles, clothing/armor and accessories.  Do they do anything?  I'm not sure.  I do hope so though I cant find any info online anywhere.  #4, Animals.  To farm and to pet. Milk and eggs are a must have for the kitchen!  Many of these points will likely be addressed and added as the game develops, and I am confident, given update regularity, that this title will share the top of my library page favorites section with the aforementioned AAA titles.

The setup is based on the Chinese ""cultivation"" stories, which is high-flying fantasy with martial arts, spells, spirits and demons, and humans developing immortality by cultivating their own spritual growth. The player character is such a person, a cultivator, invited to join a sect of cultivators in their mountain temple, to develop and farm the fertile ground in the valley beneath, both in terms of farming and spiritual power. However, disaster strikes, and you instead become part of the effort to rebuild the sect.

The gameplay is smooth and lovely, with only a few bits that could be improved, mostly QoL stuff. Combat exists, but feels mostly like a different form of harvesting or foraging, and it fits right in with the actually extremely chill vibe this game has. You'll spend your days working the soil, cooking food and building furniture, and rebuilding the sect both in terms of buildings and stature. And it will all feel very fulfilling and satisfying, as you see the results of your efforts begin to take shape.

Combat is simple but fun and feels good.  Your basic attack is a ranged one where you use a sword technique to basically throw your artifact sword out at enemies. It gets more involved as you learn new spells and techniques to add to your hotbar.

I still recommend this, but should point out that at this stage in early access it feels more like a very well put together 20+ hour demo.

I had a blast and was only leaving the game to look up characters who I needed to turn in missions from the bulletin board because the people finder is awful.  Names overlaid on names, names hidden behind background elements, etc.  They really would do better with a zoom function, a dropdown to locate someone, a search function, or something.  The text is tiny and it gives me a headache trying to use it.

As I got further into the game it was still a blast but the lack of polish was starting to show.  Chinese errors, lack of animation when you are unable to complete a task (on the character it looks the same when you can't complete a task because the hitboxes are wildly inconsistent and extremely finnicky as well as when you can't complete it because you're out of the resource needed to complete it).  Did I mention that when you get further into the game it can take a full minute to get the hitbox onto the giant highlighted cell so you can perform the action you're trying to perform?

The localization is mostly good but they haven't gotten everything.  You get some Chinese (written) dialog so you have no clue what the NPC is trying to say, Chinese options mixed in with English options when selecting what to say to the character, Chinese errors, the error that you get when it crashes that asks you to post the error has the details in Chinese, etc.  There also seem to be localization issues on some quests where the object you need has a different name in the quest then it does with the NPC you need to get it from.  The NPC calls the Stone Bath an Outside Stone Bath.  I have no idea what the NCP called the Chili one since I ended up just unlocking recopies in bulk until I got it.  That one is odd because searching online it seemed like some people were finding it with the NPC with the correct name but I carefully went through  the list 10 times before resorting unlocking recopies until it unlocked.

There are also issues that they're working on like receiving instructions in the tutorial that the patch notes say to ignore, being shown recipes to unlock that you can't unlock until you proceed further in the quest line, etc.  The instructions on bulk planting seeds could have been more clear as I spent a lot of time looking for the spell before I figured out that it was just holding E like the watering.

The game also seems to have a memory leak as well and after playing it for a while it gets slow and if you eat a haste food it crashes.  There isn't an auto save except for the end of days or manual save locations so it's very frustrating when you spend the entire day in the secret realm with good loot only for it to crash at the end.

The main campaign feels short and incomplete.  I really hope that more content is added and I'm looking forward to playing it again when it's more complete.

For an Early Access game it's a blast with a lot of needlessly frustrating bits that will hopefully be ironed out before the final release.  Where things are localized it's done very well.

Though it does have a lot of bugs, like when you are battling and wanting to advance to next cave but it doesn't prompt to teleport you unless you go in a different angle those type of bugs.  One thing it took me a while to get used to the game - abruptness. It doesn't seem to prep you with what it going to happen next, like the first breakthrough, I honestly did not know what I was going to expect until you were in it, then once you lose you are in coma for one whole day - this type of abruptness is very strange.  

Also, the fact that every item has 3 type of quality makes your storage goes full very quickly and I don't honestly think it's necessary. For the store that you are supposed to submit high quality items to unlock new seeds or prints - it's all a matter of luck whether you get something in high quality and it could take forever. I wish there could be like an item exchange board so you can submit other high quality items in exchange for the items needed for new seeds. 

In the beginning there were a lot of side tasks and it was entertaining and easier to make money, now I think I am in the middle to late stage and such tasks are very limited, I am starting to get bored because of the lack of things to do. No side tasks and I don't have the necessary items to progress in story.

Pros:
- Art style has elements of chinese watercolor. However, graphics aren't the best but I don't expect that from $17.
- Music is pleasant, ambient sounds aren't annoying (compared with the head-drilling noise of cicadas from RF5)
- Characters are enjoyable to interact with so far. Most of them don't look pre-pubescent.
- Keyboard controls aren't annoying. Gameplay isn't filled with button mashing
- Farming isn't overly complicated. There is a system for upgrading farming equipment (but it isn't complete yet).
- Story so far is interesting (trying to rebuild a sect that was destroyed).

Cons: I hesitate to put too many in this section since it's still early access
- While the art is nice, the 3D character figures are simplistic.
- As to be expected, there are still some bugs to fix. E.g. To interact with NPCs or objects, you have to move close enough for a letter to appear. Often while farming, that letter doesn't appear in spite of standing right on top of or next to the object.

Immortal Life is that Wuxia farming fantasy. If you too collapse into your bed at the end of a long day shift, turn on your looped Li Ziqi YouTube playlist and drift off while imagining living on a farm with her, doing daily living tasks of a simple but rewarding and fulfilling sort, and then going full-on Water Margin on some enemies that role up about of a subterranean cave network to threaten your peace, then this game is for you. In all seriousness, this game is charming, peaceful, and clearly made with a lot of passion for the subject matter. Devs seem responsive to feedback during early access, and right now, this game is scratching an itch for me that no AAA game is managing to do. It provides excitement, accomplishment, and ambition, but balances it with equal focus on community bonding and development for your characters, as well as peaceful introspective and contemplative moments of calm moments where one can just be, existing in the present and enjoying the world in all its serene splendor. When my anxiety flares up, sitting down to play Immortal Life, just to spend a while fishing at the Ferry Stop, or cooking dishes with Mu Xia at the inn to pass out to villagers is honestly so therapeutic for me. The pace of other farming sim/life sim games is meant to be relaxed, but can sometimes still feel oddly quick in terms of day-night cycle, but Immortal Life has a really perfect balance of pace, as well as stamina management. I cannot recommend this game enough, and if you can live with the early access roughness, you will be rewarded with a truly rich and rewarding gaming experience in the Misty Valley.

There is 18 days in a season, so season are shorter, but since crops doesnt wither and it only affects output, you CAN plant outside season, which is lovely, as somethimes you just need that one ginger for a quest.

I used to wake up early on Saturdays so I could race to the video store and rent Harvest Moon for the weekend.  This game has given me that same magical feeling and I look forward to the times I get to play.

The story so far has been pretty engaging and interesting.  It is SO refreshing to play one of these games that isn't just ""Grandpa died, here's his crappy farm, and something about a Harvest Goddess.""  It's great that the story isn't all comedic happiness.  There are a lot of serious points and it genuinely feels like I am working together WITH the other NPCs to rebuild something, rather than ""No don't worry, I've got it."" 

The characters feel like they have depth as well.  It doesn't feel like characters are just copy paste stereotypes.  Actually, none of the characters feel like they really fall into one box.  They feel a lot more dynamic and real!  Whoever is working on writing character lines has really put their all into it, and it shows in a BIG way!  Thank you!

Farming in this game stays fairly true to games like Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, and Stardew Valley.  However there are some fun new twists that I've never seen before and I LOVE it!  The endless spring gourd has changed my farming life and it's going to be hard to play other games without it.  I also love the magical watering cloud and sowing system!  Great ideas for small things that really help with setting the tone of the game.  There are no animals in this game yet, which is fairly unfortunate.  However, there is still hope that they'll add them.  With the fact that people in this universe actually consume meat, I feel like I would actually want to breed my animals rather than just buy them.  So I'm super hoping that they'll consider adding them!  Clothing in this game is also very beautiful, so it would be just excellent to see more clothing options made from different yarns.

This is the first time I've really enjoyed cooking in a game like this.  There is an option to skip the mini game once you've perfected a dish, which is great for those that want to sell their dishes.  The mini game however is actually a LOT of fun and very engaging.  You can cook multiple things at once so it really gives you incentive to plan out how you are going to do things.  Once you've popped something in to boil or steam, you can hop back over to the knife sets to prepare more ingredients for another dish.  That does a good job of making you feel like you're not waiting on timers, but rather a line chef working in a restaurant or something.  So fun!

You can really FEEL the passion that the developers have put into this game, and that is something they should be very proud of.  I know that the game is unfinished, but I would personally gladly pay a higher price for it.  Even unfinished this game is worth getting into.  For those that want to wait for the completed story, definitely buy this game when it goes full release.  It leaves all of it's recent competition in the dust.  Thank you to the developers for making me feel like the farming sim genre isn't stagnating, but growing.",1662989986,1662989986,True,69,0,0.873432755470275879,0,True,False,True

There's still a bug or three, but overall, the gameplay is fun, and interactions with your cast of self-proclaimed sect-members develop organically.

If I had a suggestion, it would be that their dialogue when speaking to them changed by season or quest step, as the daily discussions with them when farming affection lack variety. Still, they do a good job giving each one a distinct and memorable personality, and it's easy to invest in them and believe they're doing their parts to rebuild.

One of the elements that was a relief was that, despite seeming to take some ideas from My Time at Portia (decorations affecting stat recovery rather than straight increase, but still), the interactions are far less of a slog than in that game, as gameplay interactions feel far more fast-paced.

Combat is a bit on the easy side, but not so much it bothered me. The only place I would have liked more of a challenge was perhaps during cultivation breakthroughs. Though targeting spells can be a bit of a hassle.

I've had very fun playing this. The gameplay itself is the most important to me in a game, and I really appreciate the way they mix farming and cultivation. I've read one too many cultivation novels so it really tickled my fancy.
Of course, the one thing that seems a little unfinished is the main story; it felt like it ended like a prologue. I'm looking forward to more story and cultivation progress in the future.

This game dose ""work"" the deck let you use both controller and the keyboard and mouse at the same time you do have to configure the daylights out of it but it's better, where the pc really only lets you play keyboard and mouse exclusively. You can try using controller but as soon as you try to talk to some one you need to use the keyboard to continue. The text using the map is completely unreadable i could really only tell where the love interests where because they have portraits for it. I've only made it a little past the beginning and the cut scene after you gain control doesn't work completely only the audio seems to work. 

Saving for some reason dose not work.

I don't hate this game i like what I've played a lot but I wouldn't really recommend this to any one who uses controllers exclusively(like me) or any one with a steam deck right now.

The community posts have been helpful in figuring out some issues that came up as I was trying to fulfill quests.

In both cases, I had to exit the game, close steam, and retry again to get over the bug.

I also enjoy the inventory system and the save system - inventory is fairly easy to upgrade and I'm far from using up what I currently have available.  Being able to save without ending a day is also very useful.

Aside from some missing translation, I encounter no bug or technical issue in my play trough. The game was so polished that you'll think it's already a completed game until you hit the end content of the early access, which still very huge.  
  
The main story in early access end around chapter one (there should be three or four chapter, I guess) But the game still have many thing for you to do. Farming, Building, Crafting, Cooking, Dungeon dwelling, Relationship, etc. It like Rune Factory, but with Wuxia theme.  
  
My only complain in this Early Access is, The cultivation level are capped at the lowest rank (It has 5 or 6 major rank I believe, but you can't break trough to rank 2 in this current patch (0.50.2)). This made the game less enjoyable, because anything you do are contribute to cultivation, and there are many thing to do, but your character stop growing after the cultivation cap, which made the character progressing uneven with the rest of the current content. I hope there'll be a patch to raise the cultivation limit soon.  
  
With all that said, I still enjoy the game with limited character growth, because there's many thing to do, and the game has it charm that you can't find in other game.

It is a ""casual"" farming simulator similar to Stardew, Rune Factory, Harvest Moon, and ETC. So if you don't enjoy those styles of games, I will say step away now because it barely half fills the mold left behind by these titans of the genre. The farming is very simplistic and slow. In fact, the farming is so slow to really get you started due to how fast the clock spins; the game initially gives you the ability to summon a small raincloud in order to do it faster as well as tokens to instantly grow crops in the initial game and demo. Some crops can be harvested multiple times while others cannot. In addition to this, you can get Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Legendary level crops from just about all crops though some only have Common & Legendary styles. This means your actual cut for crops changes based on RNG and can be both a boon and a curse if you try to depend on getting a certain amount. That said, you can also get free seeds ""reclaiming"" {Don't know why you didn't just say TILL} wild grass and clearing it up. The seeds seem to be based around the current season so you may not want to clear up your entire field immediately.

Now onto fishing. Fishing is.... boring unfortunately. It's simple mechanics and easy to spot pre-fish {You can tell the fish that will jump to your rod when you throw it in because it literally generates a new fish to do so} and use this method to try and aim for specific fish. Fish change based on the time of day, the location, and the season; but that doesn't change why a single key press for a caught fish becomes boring fast.

Then we get onto combat. Combat is the main reason I wanted to downvote this game. It makes the entire feel of it stutter as your character randomly swishes his or her sword at random directions not following your mouse, the initial direction you are, nor where enemies are. It makes melee combat ungodly terrible as you can literally miss lowest level enemies standing in front of you. Combat is also required to rank up your character or ""Breakthrough"". This is when you reach the next plateau of ability for cultivation and increases the cap on your stats which do affect a lot of what you can do in-game as well as your luck for better resources.
 
Then we have cooking and crafting. Cooking was definitely given the best go around in this game but it angers me so you can't hold two plates at once. If you have a single scrambled egg, it still takes up the same hand size as an entire roast? I believe if you can literally smash a person sized rock into chunks with a few swings of a pickax, you should be able to use two hands to carry at least ingredients. It would definitely allow the player to enjoy cooking a bit more when you make some of the later items. Crafting however on the Workshop is quite boring as all you do is placing items into table and swing hammer. Boom, crafted building? You could of copied your kitchen system and made things into parts so the player could be participating more, but instead it's one stop workshop.

I have not unlocked Alchemy yet {Still waiting on two items to give me what I want} so I cannot give a fair judgement on that. But as it stands, the game lacks a lot of good material. It is a meh niche that fills it's role but not amazingly well. It's got a 4 out of 10 on my rating scale. It's not bad, it's just not good. Also on that note, I have found multiple dialogue boxes in-game that are still untranslated. This review may change later as the game gets more updates, just hope it isn't abandoned for what it can be because of this bumpy start.",1656472720,1656472720,False,2,0,0.482386767864227295,0,True,False,True

It is still in early access but imo that leaves a lot of room for improvement and its super encouraging with how involved the devs have been so far, here are some positives and some potential improvements I wanted to mention...

Positives:

1. Very Relaxing
2. More than one revenue stream (don't just have to farm)
3. Magic, this is unique to this title and adds some nice QoL improvements from games like Stardew
4. Cooking is very fun, the mini game for cooking is like a mini overcooked 
5. Aesthetic, this is more opinion for sure but im a huge sucker for ancient Chinese aesthetic
6. Stardew-like, not much else to say, Stardew is a great game and this game does a good job maintaining a lot of the elements that make Stardew great while also making those elements unique to this title

Potential Improvements 

1. Quests, Mainstory quests are good, but the amount of tedious side quests can be a little overwhelming 
2. Combat, its better than Stardew but that isnt saying much, magic is definitely cool but controls can be clunky and targeting is somewhat inaccurate
3.  This is more of a bug and I don't really mind it that much but occasionally in conversation the text will randomly revert to Chinese rather than English

I will say that I would love to see Multiplayer implemented sometime down the road but obviously bugs, finishing the mainstory questline, and overall game improvements take priority. If a modding community arises for this game they might be able to add multiplayer via mods.

All in all, I love the game and actually find that it being in early access really encouraging because that hopefully means the game will only get better.

I have been looking for something like this for ages now.  It is the perfect combination of magic (like Sunhaven), crafting and building (like My Time at Portion), farming (like Story of Seasons series) and Quest tackling.  The graphics are adorable, too, which is one of my biggest (petty) gripes about games like Stardew Valley.    

I also love all the options to decorate your farmland.  Super cool.  I also found myself really enjoying the cooking mini-games, once I got the hang of it, and the ability to quick-cook once you reach 3-stars is super convenient.  A lot of stuff for this game seemed really well thought out and designed.  Also, using ~magic~ to help save time on farming is A++++.

Building up the destroyed sect from scratch is *just* the right level of difficult.  Quests are sparser than other games, and seasonal rather than daily.  Which I liked a lot, as each quest feels unique, as opposed to constant fetch-quest busy work a lot of other games have.  There's also different quests for every character, and completing these quests can unlock more goods.

The game also doesn't penalize you the way other games do, which I appreciate.  Staying up late will reduce the amount of stamina/mana/health you recover, but (as far as I know) you don't ""pass out at midnight"" like other games.  You can also grow any crop in any season (including winter!), the yield is just reduced if out-of-season.

Overall, I adore this game so much, and I can not wait to see it fully polished!!!  Is it rough in some areas?  Definitely.  But totally worth the time I've put into it so far.  I haven't felt this rewarded and enamored with a game in a long time.   I am genuinely saddened I've already completed what exists of the main quest so far.


 [b] [u] A few tips for beginning players: [/u]   [/b] 
1.  Storage is tight in the very beginning, but gets better.  Later storage will be in the form of a Shed you can build and then place on your farmland.  You can upgrade this shed repeatedly.  It's actually pretty great.  Wayyy better than the dozens of chests other games make you have.

2. 1000 small spirit shards = 1 big spirit shard.... took me an embarrassingly long time to figure this out.  So 2,595 spirit stones will read as 2 Big Shards and 595 small shards.  

3. Seasons are divided into six 3-day arcs, referred to in-game as solar cycles.  Forage-able items renew at the beginning of each arc.  I'm pretty sure new quests are triggered by the new arc-cycle too, but don't quote me on that.  Once you build the lecture hall, up to three lecturers can be scheduled within one 3-day arc.  You have to wait until the next arc to schedule more.

4. Keep every 'S' ranked item you can.  Seriously.  Also keep all of the Special Crops (wheat -> super wheat, tomatoes -> ginseng, azuki beans -> black beans, etc).  

5. Crop production resets each time you pick it.  It can definitely be worth it to save just before harvesting and then reload and try again until you get a better yield of either more 'S' ranks or ""Special Crops"".

6.  Grinding for Mining materials is a pain in the beginning, but ultimately blacksmith quests will allow you to purchase materials from the blacksmith for much less money than I was expecting.  

7. On that note:  the items in the mine and the monsters respawn each time you re-enter.  To farm cinnebar and red sand just use the quick-portal when you get it, and farm on the below level.  Than exit back up the stairs to go back to Mist Valley.  Rinse and repeat and within 3-5 trips you can get a good amount of items.

8. When using your sword, you will attack in the direction your mouse pointer is.  Make sure it's in front of  you, lol.

 [b]  [u] Wish List: [/u] [/b] 
1.  As far as I know, crop cultivation is your only option.  I would loveeee to have farm animals.  Chickens and Pigs and sheep and things.  heck, being able to actually harvest meat would be super cool, and pretty unique.

2.  Please have some ""decorate-able"" spaces near the house, where the bamboo grove is.  I would love to place a bench or some pots near my house, or maybe even a drying rack in the same spot as the loading screen, if only for the aesthetic.

3.  Character customization.

4.  Being able to visit other locations (At least where i am in the game, you can open up other trade routes...but you can't go there.  Being able to explore more places would be super fun.)",1654928068,1655926503,True,10,0,0.645562469959259033,1,True,False,True

However, some English speakers posted reviews that mentioned the translation, so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did. The English is a bit stilted in some of the dialog, but I didn't find it at all hard to figure out what the characters meant. There are a few places where someone forgot to translate the Chinese text and that's jarring, but so far I haven't run into anything game-breaking.

This is basically a farm sim, though there is much more to do than farming, thankfully. At the beginning, you arrive at a Shaolin or Taoist temple (I'm not entirely sure how it fits into Chinese culture, though it's clearly somewhat fantasy-based) and in the intro the mountain is hit by a meteor and shatters, destroying the temple and killing nearly all of the senior monks. You and some other acolytes survive, due to the mystical protection of one senior monk, who survives the blast, but falls into a coma afterward. 

One junior monk (I think) takes charge of rebuilding the temple and its surrounding village, putting you in charge of the farm. But what could have turned into a slog, producing crops for the villagers, ends up being much more interesting. As you help your companions and the villagers, you begin to learn the ways of the monastery and rise in the ranks, rebuild the wreckage, open up blocked pathways into forests and caves full of monsters, and of course expand your house and furnish it. It's a lot of fun, if you enjoy the Harvest Moon-type games.

The graphics are beautiful and ethereal and the music is gorgeous. The ""romance"" system is deathly slow (after 23 hours in game, chatting with all my companions daily and giving them gifts when I can—especially on birthdays—I'm barely at half a heart with them (out of ten hearts)), and I'm skeptical that it will allow me (as a boy) to romance any of the men. I hate to pre-judge, but I've run into this restriction on other Chinese games and their culture has a very poor track record on LGBTQ+ issues. I was hoping to find out, one way or another, before posting a review, but that will apparently take me a hundred or more hours of gameplay. 

Still, if you enjoy Chinese fantasy games, this one is very pleasant. The caves are a grind, and I still can't get past level 6, but I've been able to mine all the stuff I need for rebuilding on levels 1-5. The cooking mini-game is very entertaining and well done, and the fishing game is easy. Your crops grow year round (though with a poorer yield when they're out of season) and you can easily build automatic watering spouts that don't take thousands of dollars and rare resources to construct.

I honestly like this game because not a lot of games are heavily centered around Asia and China, and this games diverse Asian themes and focus on Chinese spiritualism makes it stand out as unique.
The game is also very relaxing, compared to other games with Chinese spiritualism that have a lot more tense and stressful feeling. This game is much better and thus much more enjoyable.
The game is very slow to progress in, which is a drawback.

But if you read the rest of the description (like the part that says more main quests will be added) and you talk with the fairly responsive developers, it seems that they likely misspoke in that part of the description since English isn't their first language. You'll also notice slight translation errors in parts of the game where you can get the idea of what the characters are trying to say, even though the words they use aren't always the correct ones from the perspective of a native speaker.

So what do you get at the moment? In my opinion, a charming farm sim with similarities to games like SDV and Harvest Moon but at an ancient temple and the surrounding areas with much more of a focus on villager interaction than SOS, SDV, or HM. The graphics are beautiful and I find it just as engaging as the heavy hitters of the genre. I've encountered no bugs. The main description next to the videos and screenshots is accurate and the price is fair. The developers have big ideas that are well thought out and seem to favor larger updates over small frequent updates, as evidenced by their status update on June 7. That's fine with me because they engage the player base and listen to concerns and ideas which is a good sign.  If you enjoy this type of game, are fine not having weekly updates, are okay with cave combat that's a little below standard at the moment, and want to support good developers whose passion shows in the product, Immortal Life is an easy recommend for the price. If you need a farm sim to sink 1,000 hours into, Immortal Life isn't there yet and may never be, but it's still worth keeping an eye on.",1654986448,1655104976,True,67,1,0.856629252433776855,0,True,False,True

I spend over 20 hours playing through what's available in the early access version. During that time I didn't have any game breaking bugs or errors, the game hasn't crashed on me once and aside from some minor annoyances (being unable to pick up decorations after placing them without changing maps first; NPCs not standing where they are shown to be on the map; some untranslated segments/buttons in the UI), I'm actually surprised by how stable this version is! I hope there will be support for the Steamdeck in the future, as I'm used to play these types of games on my portable console. I did try this one as well and while it's generally running...the controls are just terrible. Needless to say, but it plays a lot smoother, easier and nicer with access to mouse and keyboard.

My biggest point of criticism right now would be the translation. It's still very basic and often worded in an unnatural, confusing and needlessly convoluted way. I honestly think it still needs a lot of work to be enjoyable (and in some cases understandable/comprehensible) for English speakers. Luckily life/farming sims do not depend too heavily on story elements, but it would definitely add another layer of enjoyment if it was easier to read.",1654864898,1654864898,True,2,0,0.526578068733215332,0,True,False,True

I thoroughly enjoy the game and got more than my money's worth of fun. The graphics are beautiful and the music is very nice. There is a wide variety of plants, fishes, dishes, materials, furniture etc. to make use of and collect already in the early access and the devs are promising more to come. The pacing of getting to new stuff is good, you start up with a small variety then slowly unlock more and more stuff as you go. 
I have met a few small bugs here and there and a few things that could use a little improvement, but already some of them are in plans for the near-future updates. But there were also a few moments when I thought something was a bug or a mistake, but it turned out I was just doing something wrong (like when you fight creatures, you have to have your cursor in the direction of the creature from your character to swing that way, it does not swing the way you are facing - that took me so many hours to realise, I am absolutely ashamed of that; or there would be a crop mentioned in a quest that I couldn't find anywhere, but I just needed to patiently wait a few in-game days for it to show up in a store - basically everything always works out, so don't worry over having trouble with quests, just wait a bit). The devs are actively working on the game and I would say it is really promising. And even though I am done with the current main plotline (which will continue in the future), I am not getting bored at all and I can easily continue with the game even without the plotline quests as I am far from being done with everything the game currently has to offer.

I wish it had more personalization for your character but I'm not displeased with the look of the avatar or the art. On the positive side it has aspects of other games of this genre, a bit of dungeoneering, farming, fishing, social interactions, gear upgrade, tool upgrades, and various main and side missions that enrich the story.

If I had to pinpoint some cons: There's no real tooltips or anything to explain where you can get certain items needed for quests, this includes all in-game items such as fish and seeds. The quest doesn't give direction on where to start getting the items you need, you're left to wander around until you can find who might sell it or how to get it.

Even if English remains a small problem for me, the game is quite easy to understand. I am at 10h game, and personally I have not met many bugs! The game remains fluid and beautiful! It has a soothing side, you feel good when you play it. The only small problem for me is that I usually play farm games with a controller, so I hope that there will be a 100% compatibility during the final version of the game!
I would also like to make a suggestion, it would be really cool, if later in the game we could have access to the breeding of animals (pigs, chickens, or rabbits) to add a little something to our farm, since in the shop you can buy pig meat or chicken or even eggs... Or we could have beehives to collect honey, for craftes or simply to sell. I would also like to understand the relational in the game, what is the point of building the relationship with a NPC?
And also, will the game, when it is in final version will have other options for languages or will it remain in English?

I started a few days ago and restarted a few times to figure out my play style. one minor point is the loading when I try to go somewhere or enter my house i need to try multiple times to trigger the loading screen, it happens frequently and as the time goes really fast in the game I keep losing precious time trying to go from one place to another which is sad, I hope this improves later on.

The game has a ton to offer at this stage and is worth getting now, and I'm looking forward to continuing to see the game develop and play new content as it's released. There are definitely some areas that need refining, which is to be expected with an early access game, but overall the game is enjoyable and fully functional in its current state.

Pros:
-Fantastic aesthetic. The graphics are very reminiscent of Harvest Moon with a fun Chinese spin on the design. It looks great and the soundtrack is lovely too
-The use of magic for farming is useful and fun
-The cooking mini game is really well fleshed out and very enjoyable
-The variety of crops you can grow and various ways to process them is unique and something I liked a lot
-The current story and direction are interesting and very different from most games in this genre

Cons:
-Relationship building feels a little sparse right now. You can build friendships but dating/marriage hasn't been implemented yet and there's not a huge incentive to befriend anyone. This will definitely be addressed later, but isn't super exciting right now
-The game would really benefit from having some seasonal festivals. There are so many Chinese celebrations that would be an awesome addition. It sounds like the devs are already adding one event and have more in the works.
-Combat is kinda clunky and very dependent on positioning yourself just right in order to hit enemies. It could use some polish in this area.
-As noted by other reviewers, the English translation still needs work. Some things read pretty stilted and there are some items and dialogue that revert to Chinese in the English version. I didn't find that it made it difficult to understand quest objectives or get in the way of understanding and enjoying the game, but some tweaks in this area would be a good quality of life improvement for English speaking players.

- Name of NPC on map are really hard to read. This could be improved to help readability.
- Some translations missing, Not a lot and for side quests/notes entries, so not a huge issue.

I adore how involved in the community the player character is. Rather than place your produce in a box and have it mysteriously vanish in the night to deposit coins into your bank account, you need to go into town and trade it to any of the merchants there. The sect members are all doing their own thing, integrating themselves into the community.
Combat is a touch floaty atm, but given the updates talking about improving everything I currently have some problems with on that front I'm excited!!
Wishlist things for the future would be the ability to zoom in on the map, to adjust the options from the menu - the game is *very* loud on startup - and the ability to turn off auto-advance for cutscene textboxes, because they go by very quickly and if I wasn't a speed reader I wouldn't be able to keep up. 
Overall I strongly recommend this, it has incredible bones and is the most exciting and refreshing entry into this genre that I've played in years, and I adore these sorts of games and play all of them that I can get my hands on. The cast is charming, the story is fun and engaging, and I love the progression system.

PROs
The game's visuals are wonderful you can tell the devs really love their assets. There is an assortment of items and everything has a good sense of cohesion and the customization of your home is like that of Animal Crossing. Except your home directly impacts your regeneration rate of stamina, mana, and health.

Quest Tracking is pretty straightforward and tasks are easily done within their allotted time frame.

The Story is engaging and the cast of characters memorable and specialized. Kinda like your own little A team!

Farming is pretty straightforward and RNG for quality is fair.

Cooking is super fun, I love the processing and mini-game. The part time job for cooking... WE NEED MORE.

CONs
Planting can be tedious as you go cell by cell.

There are a few translation errors and when learning the map early game the text is very difficult to read.

The build mode can feel clunky and the fact that manufacturing building can't go on any ground tiles you place is disappointing.

The crafting workbench, though neat is could use some changes. Such as resource payment/ stamina cost for crafting especially if you want to make things in bulk.

Combat I know is on their itinerary to revisit so I will refrain from making input on it.

The caves need polishing, the elevation glitching with mobs and the fact they can attack you through impassable objects makes it a pain when you encounter a space where there are a dozen mobs.

Pricing needs some balancing crop seeds early game are expensive.

Overall definitely worth the price and I look forward to the next leg of the story!",1652067205,1652067267,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

This game is literally something I have been looking for since I remember B) It still needs lots of work, but that's understandable since it's merely the early access. It's heartwarming to see how much the producers care about their work, bringing us constant updates with the bug fixes etc. Thank you for this game, it made its way into my top 3 favorite games :)

bugs i encountered:

- after watering with the water bottle, it's bugged in the character's feet
- game can randomly crash while bringing furniture back to the inventory (encountered in the house)
- the walking animation after planting is nonexistent, the character literally SMUDGES through the map lmao

wishlist for the future:
 
- definitely a character customization of my own, more outfit choices etc. i think for a game like that it's necessary to have,
- info book, showing you where you can find certain items. ex. some exotic ones or magical ones, it doesn't exactly say it which makes you stuck at some quests until you somehow manage to randomly get it,
- more clear graphics,
- more voice overs for the dialogues (really love the voices)
- smoother animations

Game pacing is good, in my opinion; not too fast, not too slow. I would not say that this game is particularly difficult to get used to, either - though that might be because I am already used to games such as Stardew Valley, Story of Seasons, Harvest Moon etc. Development and growth of a Sect and developing a character's cultivation is an interesting new twist that I have so far particularly enjoyed.

If you like the Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley genre of games you can't go wrong with this one. It's a cute Wuxia themed game where you farm, cultivate and help manage the Guiyun Sect. I found myself not wanting to play anything else for the whole 28 hours it took me to complete what is available of the Story right now.

Early Access:
The devs are super active, the game feels very fleshed out for what's available now. I only had a single crash to desktop when failing a breakthrough. Translation in the game is mostly complete, there are a few places where it is still Chinese text but it didn't stop me from understanding anything or impede the game at all.

Story:
Without giving any spoilers, the story so far is really interesting personally. The characters of your sect all have their own personalities and backstories that makes them feel real. They each have their own tastes and gifts that they like. The main story have a good hook and compels you to want to go ahead with the related quests.

Farming:
The farming is fun and there are a ton of different crops each with their own legendary variant that you can farm. A lot of them are used in Main, Side and Bounty board quests as well as researching new things.

Crafting:
Crafting has 80+ recipes you can make. You get a house that can be expanded several times to give you a lot of room to decorate. You can also craft other devices that give you access to sauce's and alcohol, etc.

Cooking:
There are a lot of recipes in the game that use a variety of fish, herbs, sauces, and crops. These are used to recover stamina, boost attack damage, boost defense, increase movement speed, etc. All the foods come in a variety of rarities that increase the effects of the food.

Combat:
For now combat is fairly basic. You do get spells but a lot of them are situational, probably for situations that are not in the game at the time of writing this review. Still, the combat is fast and fluid.",1651642197,1651642197,True,19,0,0.722949624061584473,0,True,False,True

This game is a perfect mix of Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons with Xianxia. If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, and/or Stardew Valley, I would highly suggest keeping an eye on this game. Its a wonderful, refreshing take on the farming simulator style game that Harvest Moon popularized. I enjoy every mini game, especially the cooking. Personally, I think the fishing could be improved slightly, but mostly in terms of knowing the quality of fish you are getting rather than the actual mechanics of the fishing. I personally think the current mechanics are perfectly fine, especially since it's the exact same format that has been used in Animal Crossing for 2 decades (don't fix what isn't broke! Coming from Stardew, if you make the fishing mini game too complicated and hard, many people will opt to just make a mod to bypass it entirely.)

Right now, the game is in early access with many bugs and not much to do, but the developers have been continuously addressing bugs, suggestions, and have even posted their May to June road map which includes new content. I know many have complained about the combat, but the developers have stated that they are going to be working on revamping it in the future! 

All in all, I thoroughly enjoy this game and I am excited to see how the game develops in the future. 

Some suggestions I have:
1. A glossary of sorts! It would be nice to have a something like a collection glossary for those who like getting every single item possible. I also suggest maybe including a glossary of terms? Many may be unfamiliar with certain phrases and words that are heavily associated with the Xianxia genre, especially in the West. 
2. Toggle option for auto text and manual clicking through text. Currently the game has it as a mixed bag, and for english it goes very quickly. So I think maybe seeing if a toggle could be added for those who want auto scrolling text and then maybe slowing down how quickly it goes through in english. 
3. Auto adding crop seeds to your bar? Right now you have to go back into your inventory and then put it onto your bar. Maybe even just making it so you have the option to select where you want your purchased seeds to go (item bar or inventory). This seems a bit weird to ask, but having to continuously go into your inventory to add seeds gets a bit tedious at times ^^;...
4. Make some of the text clearer: In english, the text for the cutscene in the beginning can be very hard to read and the text for the map is also fairly difficult to read. For the map text, I don't know if adding stroke to the text, changing the color, or changing the font style would make it more readable.",1651617151,1651617151,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's been quite some time since I last saw a farming game this well polished, and the best part is they are still not done yet!
My favorite part is no doubt the cooking system. You choose what you want to make, then you have to actually make the food, cutting the vegetables, stir frying it on the pan, or preparing the meat so you can boil it in a soup and so on...
The farming is like most other games, except that you can summon a rain cloud to do the work for you and use special seals to force the crops to grow all at once. It would be nice if they added more unique features here, but for now at least the base is solid and I find nothing to complain.
The dungeon raiding has a lot of potential as well. I only reached as far as the 5th or 6th floor as those bats are terrifying! They mob at us and drain our health in a flash, so be extra careful of them and unlike me, try to remember you have potions! lol
The fishing is... normal. Just throw the bait and wait for the fish to bite... but make sure it really bit it before pulling or you will be wasting your energy! You can know it really did if it goes deep in the water. Play and you will understand what I mean.
The story is good enough. A disaster occours and you choose to help rebuild the sect you were meant to enter. This gives plenty of excuses for the game to give you objective after objective while slowly unlocking new game features. There seems to be no time limit so just enjoy it at your own pace.
Now for the down sides: honestly I don't have much to say for now, but maybe the things that I'm missing the most are the festivals that we have in other games, like harvest festival, cooking festival, since this is a martial arts game, why not a tournament?
Another small inconvenient is that when I attack, the sword follows the mouse direction, but when I use the skill, the skill is released toward whatever direction the character is facing instead of the mouse direction like the sword. I pray this is a bug that will be corrected later, as it makes no sense for them to work in different ways...
When buying things at the shops, there are many times when I don't know how much money I have. It would be nice if they could make it more obvious.

Let's hit the low points first: the text has been translated, but not localized, so you'll have to infer the plot from partially broken English.  The game is also a little short and repetitive at time of review since it's still in Early Access.

That said, it has most of the charm of Stardew plus better graphics and a unique setting.  The basic farming system is largely complete. and the visuals and sound design are top notch, and there are a variety of other systems available to dip your toes into and quests to complete, so you can get into a relaxed vibe and enjoy what's available to explore for quite a while before running out of story.

It was clearly released earlier than expected, because some items (e.g. the Guide to Swordsmanship) have no use, while others needed for quests appear to be missing.

Pros:
+ Neat rain cloud watering mechanic
+ unique cultivation sect aesthetic
+ interesting cooking mini-game
+ interesting production chains
+ interesting, unique crops with pretty art

Cons:
- rain cloud watering mechanic has this weird bug where it starts only watering 1 square instead of the full 2x2 area, so you have to waste the first few seconds finagling it into covering it's full area before moving it
- rain cloud watering mechanic (spell) is the only farm related spell. This is an awesome concept, but there need to be similar spells for other farming activities if this is a farming game
- Game currently has many more combat related mechanics (health, attack power, defense power, spell power, spell defense, armor, multiple combat spells, etc) than farming mechanics. It feels more like an adventure game with farming tacked on than a farming game. Give me a spell to chop wood with. Give me a spell that makes fish jump out of the water and into my hands, begging me to eat them. Give me a spell to cook with or process food.
- Only two tiers of equipment
- Many items don't have a description or stats explaining what they do, so you're forced into buying things at random and hoping to make progress
- both cooking and most production chains are time sinks which turns them into traps. Also, playing the cooking mini-game is fun the first few times, but after making my dozenth steam bun I just want to be able to hit a button and get my bun without spending so much real time on it.
- no controller support.
- Wheat, Rice, and Bell pepper seed prices are too high compared to other options. Wheat is particularly bad. It is better to never grow wheat and only buy wheat flower and other wheat products when needed. You save almost no spirit stones by doing the work yourself, and the time spent on those steps could bring in twice as many spirit stones as the purchase prices if spent on other activities.

Bottom line - this is a cool concept, but not yet a cool game that I can recommend. I do like the idea, and there are many aspects to like.

I only ran into 2 minor bugs. I had so much fun playing this gem of a game. For the price point and 30 hours of content you really can't go wrong.

Calming music

Base building

with that in mind, i can now recommend this game. my main gripe is now the dodging/blocking when fighting, and a lack of dash/faster movement in general. please consider adding these to the game!

thank you for your quick work devs!




og review below : 




this is a game i wish i could say yes, i recommend this game. it has everything that i like in a game, life sim, upgrades, cultivation, farming, and relationships! there's countless things to upgrade and rebuild and the game is pretty expansive on that end. 

however at this point there are way, way too many things that outweigh the positives of this game. and i hate to say that because i've been following their progress on twitter on steam for a while now! it's obvious they put a lot of tlc into the game and even scrapped a lot of work and re-did a lot of things. when the game is fixed and balanced out i will absolutely recommend this game. 


at this point i will stop playing the game until future updates with patches and balancing issues are taken care of, listed in no particular order;

there is no dodge or block for attacks, so we have to tank everything. our hp is very low but getting more is tied to cultivation, and you basically get 2 shot in cultivation. even when i drank potions and had buffs it was extremely difficult, i could not manage to pass the first stage of cultivation. considering how easy it was to unlock the first stage of breakthrough, i thought it'd be easier than dodging everything and getting 2 hit.


very low drop rate of items that you need to upgrade your tools, farm, house, etc; i had to spend a few in-game days farming for 5 drops of 1 item. i preferred skinning them to get the drops every time. because the items i needed were pretty far down in the dungeon, it takes a long time to run there and farm every day.

sense of progression is very free, which is nice, but there are so many main story paths it's difficult to tell which one i should do first vs another.

getting upgraded resources is difficult and the game does not tell you when/how to get more i.e i am out of superior stone and need it for many upgrades, yet i havent found a place to farm it yet. the farm itself doesnt have enough to cover a lot of upgrades. if the place to farm it is locked behind a specific quest, and i dont have enough resources to unlock it, i have no way of knowing what i should be focusing on first to not waste my upgrades for resources.

the rotating store is annoying. very annoying. i need certain seeds from that section and it only changes every 2 days, i havent gotten the seed i need to appear and i only have 5 days left until i fail the quest for it now. ive checked every 2 days in summer. i will fail this quest because of the rotating store.

there is no way to pause the time. if i need to check something in the menu, like my long quest list, i need to run to a save stone in order to check it if i dont want to miss out of 1 hour of time while i look through which name needs which item. the time does not pause in vendors, and if i select any f menu it'll time out and put me back in game time.

there is no way to run or move faster, like a dash, so moving around feels extremely slow. 

planting and harvesting seeds/fruit is very slow. i had a tonne of seeds to plant and harvest and it literally took the entire day to harvest half of the field. on that note, please increase the speed of the animation for the watering can, it feels as if the player is being punished for not using the spell, but it takes a lot of mp  to use the spell.",1651222698,1651523144,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,True

My pet peeves so far:
-The first name, last name system is broken. It doesn't leave any space between your first and last name.
-Switching tools is clunky, needs to be set up on the scroll wheel
-The map is awful, hard to read the text and hard to navigate the map itself if you want to look at another area
-The caves desperately need a starting floor option. Having to run through all the floors every single time is quite annoying.
-Kitchen Helper IV seems to be broken. You cannot complete either recipe and get stuck in the kitchen.
-Game sometimes crashes when navigating the build sect menu.

It's still early in development! As of this time of leaving a review, There are small bugs here and there, and the english translation is sometimes missing or incomplete, but the developers are rapidly fixing & expanding it, and context clues or community help can solve problems quickly. 


The bones of this game are excellent! The characters are unique, the art and music is GORGEOUS, and after 7 hours playing, it's hitting a good mix of 'helping a beginner' and 'not TOO easy' for me.

Here is what my opinion about this game.

-Game is very relaxing, graphic and music are well done, despite that positive factor, the character portraits needs to have more variety to make the gameplay feel more engaged. Right now it doesn't matter the sect is facing catastrophe, every npc will keep straight face like it is not bothering them, which make its a bit off for me.

-Relationship system needs a lot more work, right now it seems like they're just npcs that will give you quest, 1 and a half hour of playing I don't find pursuing any of the dating candidate to provide me with any tangible reward.

-Dungeon with daoist skill is pretty cool, but monster is a little bit shabby.

-Extremely small map, nothing to explore

-Aside from those npcs who are helping you rebuilding the sect, everyone else seems insignificant.
