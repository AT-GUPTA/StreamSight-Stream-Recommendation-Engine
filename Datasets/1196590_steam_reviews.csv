Fantastic Game overall
Great story, atmosphere, music and so on

If you like a to play a good zombie shooter story, there you go.
If you are done with it, try RE7 aswell since the graphics are not that much older and the story there is scary and great aswell. I even did play/Finish RE 1 because these 2 games have been that brilliant. And RE 1 has really really shitty graphics let me tell you.

As always, the Resident Evil game franchise continues to deliver in spades with their survival-horror genre, and this release takes the baton from their previous titles flawlessly.  

Gameplay: Greatly increasing Ethan Winters' abilities, a much larger variety of weapons and strategies are now at your disposal. Continuing the 1st person view from previous works, up to 4 weapons may be quick-equipped, allowing you to select the most optimal equipment to deal with certain foes while preventing damage by dodging, hiding, or blocking. 

Combat: In typical horror fashion, failing to adequately defend yourself often leads to severe punishment or outright death, courtesy of the games' custom execution animations. This becomes most evident on the highest difficulty, where increased enemy health and damage are now accompanied by additional enemy spawns, earlier scripted battle scenes, upgraded enemies, and increased enemy combat intelligence (such as staggering towards the player when shot), mitigating extra content cheats such as infinite ammo. The mid-bosses are slightly repetitive but occur at far enough intervals where they don't become too much of an annoyance. The boss fights, however, are the main focus; a wide variety of specialized attacks serves to uniquely personify their character along with other background information you may discover throughout the map, especially regarding a certain 8 foot tall vampiress.  

Exploration: While not required, adequately exploring the map and pursuing side-missions is heavily recommended, and serves to greatly reward the attentive player, yielding riches of money, supplies, critical enemy information, or specialized tools. Puzzles, treasure maps, and optional combat scenarios await your inquisitive nature should you so choose...

Immersion: The vastly larger and isolated mountainous exterior serves as a stark contrast to the dark and oppressive interior, a classic feature of Resident Evil. Player movement is surprisingly human, displaying small pauses for vaults, movement reversals, or opening doors in addition to other actions. Disgustingly detailed enemy models are accompanied by hyper-realistic combat animations, ranging from attacks to movements to deaths. The nearly overwhelming number of detailed and distinct sound effects serves to root your attention to your screen at all times as you listen to Ethan's nervous breathing or the breaking of sticks in the woods.

Non-gameplay: The game is graphically gorgeous, with falling snow, player/enemy characters, tools, and more. As mentioned before, the sound quality and content is insanely immersive. Quality of life aspects are quite user friendly, with save and loading screens conducted nearly immediately other than the initial load in from the main menu. Finishing the game rewards the player by unlocking additional challenge perks that will serve to greatly alter traditional gameplay, including unlocking a mini-mercenary game or the aforementioned infinite ammo. A DLC with additional story and gameplay content is also available for download (Winters' Expansion - Shadows of Rose).
The trade-off is the high temperatures this game will generate; it is highly recommended to throttle your CPU or graphics cards (reducing electric consumption = less heat), and even then my own computer was hovering in the mid-50 degrees Celsius. You will most likely hear your computer fan running at full blast to cope with this large game, so make sure to have some temperature monitoring software running. 
This website serves as a great guide to bring down your computer temperature: https://www.ultrabookreview.com/31385-the-throttlestop-guide/
  
All in all, a fantastic continuation of the Resident Evil series, and it is clear that a staggering amount of effort was put into the makings of this game. As a RE fan, you will enjoy the continued and surprising changes to the plot and characters in the RE universe, and if you're new to this franchise, this game is user friendly enough where it does not require you to play previous titles to enjoy its content. 

10/10 would highly recommend playing this masterpiece.

If you are a producer or contributor to the makings of this game, know that you deserve a pat on the back and more for your efforts, and I hope you keep up the good work. I look forward to supporting your future products when they are unveiled. 
As a long time fan, thank you for your efforts and service. Please go eat some ice cream or something similar.

But I think thats just me making commentary on how sludge first person control is compared to third person, coming back from 400 odd hours on elden ring. Re8 is a high budget game well optimised for PC as far as i know, so for starts, achievement huge, there. It has guns that look good and feel good and ooomph to use, unlike every other first person game with good looking graphics. Graphics mind, are very nice, but i dont think any game going for an irl look has yet managed to look like rl yet. Replayability for this linear piece is extremely high in my opinion, for the story mode, simply because its a good enough thoroughfare that you want to replay vos new game, but this time take no damage or deal all headshots/only hit vulnerable areas. Or literally, you just want to replay one of your pref challenges, because, to be perfectly honest, finishing headshot only vos is not like learning to kill tree sentinel no damage, every new playthrough youll have only slightly less of a mess in store than last time, in how your reaction speed increased incrementally, and thats it, with the very, very good ai, leagues above above games. Rather, one way to put the excellence of the vos ai, is that when you fail to shoot a lycan as it performs a specific attack, it will then do only that attack until youve gotten a handle or messed up. Further, when you aim at enemies, they immediately dodge, meaning you have to be very very good not to miss once, and hence the ridiculous tragedy of headshot only run. On the case of the mercenaries, getting triple S for all of them, is, very, very fun, and adds a heck of a lot of playtime on (My 265 hours, i beat hardcore, then vos new game, and now i mess about for the story with mainly resource based challenges (i.e. the aforementioned headshot only strife) i have also SSS ranked castle and village, but rather im nowhere near done with the game by any means, so rather, bang for ones buck, achieved). By the way, you do not need full combo for triple S, you take it with a certain score.

With so many things to find in the games map, fun boss fights, and new game+ encouraging the player to replay the game over and over to max guns out you can easily end up playing through it 5+ times without it getting too stale.

Despite it's good story mode, that's all the game has that's enjoyable. Starting with Mercenaries (A bonus mode that comes with the game) holy shit is this mode is beyond a disappointment. 

Going into Mercenaries I was coming into it expecting it to be something like Jacks 55th birthday from people comparing it to mercenaries mode and damn did it just fall flat for me. The routing is just unintuitive and requires you to know dumb specific triggers to spawn enemies if you want high ranks, the powerups are a very boring addition and are just a full on downgrade from the ones in Jacks 55th Birthday, there's never variety or thought put into which weapons you get, and instead of the timer being important they made the game entirely based on your combo. The timer could have been something fun like having to kill all enemies before the timer runs out and how much time you have left determines your rank. (Also personal gripe is killing only adding to your timer instead of pausing it for X amount of time as it is just not nearly as satisfying.)

The rest of the game can be found in the form of very overpriced DLC that just isn't worth it. ($20 for more Mercenaries and Shadows of Rose is just not a good price)

Shadows of Rose is just a cash grab DLC that just reuses the main game, the enemies are very boring, and it only has two good parts. These parts include a weeping angel segment and a the final boss, both of which aren't even original.",1708032247,1708032403,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

A great use of survival horror, jumpscares, conservation of items, creepy characters and awesome boss fights. I'm really happy Capcom experimented with the series in a different way because this is one of the best Resident Evil games in the franchise.

A lot of people complain about the first person mode, and sure, it's not ideal, but for me, it makes the whole game a lot scarier. Sure, if this game was an RPG, it would probably be annoying, but its full use of first person really makes this one of the more unique games in the series.

What I like so much about this game though is that's its a mix of RE4 and RE7. It has the creepy but action packed atmosphere of RE4 (without the escort quests, thank god), and the strange characters and awesome boss fights from RE7. 

Overall, this game is amazing. It fixes all the issues from the previous games, with more interesting levels, game design and variety. I highly reccommend fans and first-timers to play it, especially when you go in blind. Not knowing anything makes the experience 1000 times better.

The combat is not really my favorite in the series, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying some other parts of the game more. I realized that many of the locals are very cool and the art team did an amazing job with basically everything in this game. Visually it's great! The story was silly and the characters were campy. But I liked it! The Dimitrescu family was quite intimidating and Heisenberg is super attractive and hot. Although getting through some of the different locations game play wise was a little tedious at times. [SPOILERS] For example, I wasn't a big fan of the Monreau section and the doll section with the baby kind of slowed the pace down a lot. I liked it the first time, but later playthrough it just became a little stale. The factory also wasn't too fun on my first few playthroughs since the layout was a little confusing for me. I liked the enemies in that area though. It gave me a nice challenge without them jumping away from each shot constantly. 

All in all, I think it's fun to experience this game atleast once with the Rose DLC after you're done. Both are very fun!

The entire game ends up feeling like Resident Evil 4 crossed with 5.
Resident Evil 4 because of the style/theme, Resident Evil 5 because of all the action the game puts you through.

I certainly enjoyed this a lot more than Resident Evil 5, but at the same time I prefer 5 more because their co-op mode made that game way more enjoyable. (Especially with how dumb things got) This game has no co-op so I'll probably never touch this game again.

After you defeat Lady Dimitrescu you'll literally stop caring about the game. At that point you're done with the castle and you've killed all her sisters and the game at the point becomes a full on action game, rather than a horror game. With exception to that one scene in the mansion (Which is the ONLY scary scene in the ENTIRE GAME)

Enjoyable game, unique gothic style, but it feels like a lot of wasted potential. They clearly had a lot of ideas for this game yet it feels like they held back on ALL OF IT.

The final boss is also just a big bullet sponge (Just like some of the bosses before it) so I hope you stocked up on ammo and health before this because you'll be using all of it here.. (If not then may god have mercy on you)",1628262530,1707568861,False,5,0,0.501164078712463379,0,True,False,False

  The game has one of the most realistic graphics and textures I've ever seen. The storyline, the idea, the characters, the music - the whole gameplay is amazing. Personally, I've completed the whole game with everything possible to do in about 12 hours, but if you speedrun the game it will take you two hours and a half, which is actually normal for singleplayer storymode game (ignoring the fact I have more than 62 hours on the game). 
If you have completed the game - there is mini game named - The Mercenaries, where you can fight zombies and ""having fun"", but here is the part where I think there are some drawbacks.  I believe the main gameplay and storyline do not have drawbacks, but here I will ""complane"" about the mini game - The are some bugs about the abilities, because when I got one it didn't worked and I died, also I don't like that when you shoot at the zombies' heads they don't react like you shoot them, but like you caress them - but here let's say that is because they are zombies. At the end when I completed The Mercenaries I was very happy I earned my last achievement, but I still want to replay the game.

  To finish with, the game is amazing - there are so much action and there are some horror scenes that have kept me under pressure and the boss fights are amazing, even more interestic that the other RESIDENT EVIL games, but in fact every RE game have unique and amazing boss fights. Also the music in the game make even better experience, also when your with headphones. And that's little spoil and maybe I am wrong, but I've played OUTLAST 2 and then RE7 and RE8, which are of course better than OUTLAST 2 but the storyline is very similar, so I think RE have got  bit from OUTLAST idea (""a bit"" because at first if you have played the games - they won't have anything in common, you just have to take a closer look in the both games storyline and details). That's is all I want to say about RESIDENT EVIL VILLAGE.

  So if you want to play ACTION horror storymode singleplayer game with interesing unique storyline and with realistic textures and graphics - play RESIDENT EVIL VILLAGE, but before that make sure you've played RESIDENT EVIL 7 BIOHAZARD to learn the full story of the 2 games. - I hope you enjoy it, because I really did!!",1653151095,1707301506,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The  Rose DLC is also pretty good honestly idk why a lot of people didn't seem to like it

I completed the game on hardcore and from my experience the hardest part in this game ( or from any of the resident evil games I've played so far) is the beginning segment since it explains fucking nothing)

Ethan could've been a silent protagonist, and nothing would have to be altered. and how he just glosses over the merchant knowing everything he needs to do and just doesn't bother asking him how he knows any of that and just rolls with it and buys all his gear no question just sets off my immersion alarm and keeps it ringing. Gameplay and atmosphere is my favorite so far, story feels contrived. it's worth playing of course, just don't expect to see any of that ""Masterful Storytelling"" they tease you with. Also, this game literally would never had happened if Ethan made the same choice i did in RE7.

Edit: beat it after 30 hours, says the in game time to complete was only 10 but that just does not add up to me. The storytelling does pickup towards the end for sure tho. Great plot points but the dialogue can still be pretty lacking at times.

And although this series is not a stranger to jumping the shark and overeaching, RE8 still manages to pull it off quite nicely.

RE8 picks up a couple of years after 7, with Ethan and Mia married with a child who becomes the new center of the story. The game takes us to a very RE4 village but instead of ganados, we find lycans, giants, zombies, vampires and all other sort of very fantastical very not much of a Resident Evil bioweapon style enemies. And somehow, they manage to pull it off. As I mentioned before, the plot overreaches. Not gonna spoil anything, but let's just say that it ties itself with the previous games to give itself a reason for existence and for adding an insane quota of fantasy into the series. It doesn't entirely feel like and RE game because of it, but then again, after all the shark jumping the series has been known for, this comes out as somewhat acceptable. I buy it, what can I say...

Gameplay wise, it leans much more into action than it's previous entry. With RPG elements of course, crafting, and a more open ended world to explore, although retaining every element that has made the series style of map exploration. It tries to balance horror with action (again just like RE4) and even if it doesn't get to do it perfectly, which might offend the more classic fans of the franchise, it does the best it can juggling with both genres. RE8 it's not a scary game, but don't get me wrong, it can be terryfying from time to time: house Beneviento comes out of nowhere, and it's f****** scary man let me tell you that, being chase by Lady Dimitrescu is unnerving and the general atmosphere is enough to keep you on your toes; but you are gonna be much more prepared for most of it, it's harder to be left with no bullets in this one, and the general vibe of it and it's creatures, come out more of a startling vibe than a horror vibe. It is a startling game. It's definitively gonna startle you.

RE8 is a great game indeed, doing it's best to balance two genres and, albeit not having the most sublte of the stories, it still manages to keep you engaged and wondering what's next for the series. One of the best of the year for sure.

In some ways it's great seeing all those good bits work together. In others it feels like retreading old ground. Yes there's a Resident Evil 4 village. Yes there's another Resident Evil mansion. Yes there's an unstoppable behemoth stalking the map. Yes there are somewhat ludicrous puzzles and gates that open when you jam things-that-don't-look-like-keys-but-are into them. And yes there's some other bio-engineered bug turning people into monsters - because of course. Right? It's a Resident Evil game!

As a game it still holds together extremely well and Capcom have finely tuned what makes a great Resident Evil experience down to a fine art now. My only real complaint is that the tone of the game goes from dark and grisly, to somewhat cringe as Capcom strays into self-parody with some of the character designs and dialogue. I wish they could settle on a serious tone and not let it get too ridiculous. It's jarring especially when you see the great build up, tension, and horror that they've put into this game - only for them to wreck it with something completely nonsensical.

Resident Evil Village is a 2021 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. It is the sequel to Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017). Players control Ethan Winters, who searches for his kidnapped daughter in a village filled with mutant creatures. Village maintains survival horror elements from previous Resident Evil games, with players scavenging environments for items and managing resources. However, it adds more action-oriented gameplay, with higher enemy counts and a greater emphasis on combat.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]Reach for the Moon Engine (also known as RE Engine) is absolutely breathtaking. The environments in this game just suck you in into the experience. This is the future for Resident Evil and I couldn’t be any happier. The environments look abandoned and lived in, the architecture is stunning and the lighting is pure next level. The better thing is how good it runs. They truly optimized this game really well. The animations are really well done as well! You can feel the dread in the air, the chills from the cold environments, it's just so well done. The enemy and boss design is superb and the Castle section of the game is so beautiful, and scary at the same time. I can’t find one error in the graphics departments. It’s a true masterpiece![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Resident Evil Village has a mix of Resident Evil 7, and Resident Evil 4 on the side. Let me explain - You have the merchant bag from RE4. Now I actually enjoyed this a lot. You can upgrade your weapons and inventory from the merchant, and can also buy new and unlocked end game weapons from him as well! You can find currency (just like RE4) that you can use to buy these upgrades and weapons from. You also have collectables to sell and so on, you get the idea. Now this game feels really similar to RE7 in terms of combat, and that's a good thing. The combat felt fluid, and a great balance of action and pace. You have many kinds of weapons in this game and a great amount of enemy variety and I’m really pleased with that. The puzzles were pretty easy and you will have no issues with those, so if you are looking for big brain puzzles here, unfortunately Resident Evil Village is empty in that department.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story continues from Resident Evil 7 and they do a pretty good job with it to be honest. I was absolutely hooked from the beginning, and all the way to the end. Now there are some parts in the story that could have been better in my opinion. The doll house could have been expanded with more horror elements as I felt that game me the most in terms of psychological horror. The boss fights were a mix bag. Some of the fights were absolutely incredible, and some other ones just felt kinda lazy in my opinion. I also wish Chris had more screen time. Capcom kinda did Chris dirty in this game. He was a bad*ass, but would have been nice to see him interact more with Ethan. The last boss fight was also not great and that’s a true shame. The main antagonist could have done some better writing and more screen time. Besides those negatives, I did enjoy the story and I'm happy it continues from RE7, so if you haven’t played RE7, please play that one first because it’s definitely worth the whole story.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]You have a good amount of playtime here for a Resident Evil title. The story took me around 12 hours to complete (which is pretty good for a RE game). You also have some good replayability since you have many unlockables and challenges. The Mercenaries mode is okay in this game. It’s not the best form of Mercenaries mode in a RE title in my opinion. It's still fun to play, but you probably won’t spend much time on it (only if you are trying to get achievements).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is so amazing here! The music is incredible and fits the game so well. The voice acting is really good, and the ambiance has such a terrifying sound to it. Maybe it’s the music, or it could be that the monsters sound really scary in this game. The gun sounds pretty good and the UI noise is satisfying to hear.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I had some minor bugs, the inventory system can be finicky with the mouse at times. I don’t really know any bugs that stood out to me. Maybe I was just too immersed into the game and didn’t pay attention to them lol.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]For a beautiful game like Village, I had no issues with performance. I played on Ultra and had no frame drops at all! The game was just flawless for me. No stutters, crashes, nothing bad here. The RE engine is just perfect, runs like magic.[/td]

        [td]🏆Rating[/td]
        [td]7/10
This game is worth the full price, but I would wait for a sale if you are patient for around 25-50% off.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]I was really skeptical with the whole vampire theme they were going with, but they really pulled it off! The map design is flawless and has the vampire castle vibe to it that fits so well. It's by all means not perfect as I had some issues with the story, but overall it was a good experience. This is a sequel to Resident Evil 7 (Biohazard) so I do recommend playing that first. This is a must buy for any horror fan. It’s a great game with horror and action. Really well done![/td]

Pros:
-Gameplay mechanics are fluent enough
-Story was riveting (Based off playing RE7)
-Numerous different enemies throughout game
-Huge map
-Every different area is original
-Still has the enclosed scary feeling from other RE games
-The four lords all have their own quirk (making the different bosses new and always a different fight)
-Always on the edge of my seat
Cons:
-Boss battles are a little lack luster and provide little for tactics (all seem to be closely related other than the boss)
-Sprinting while going from W to WD or WA has an awkward movement (still very playable)
-Playable characters don't sprint as if it is life or death (I prefer player models to run like hell)
-Some moments I find myself wondering WTH do I do? (this is not the worst but can also be a pro)
-The game goes by a little quick in terms of what is truly happening in the story.
-Not as scary as some of the older games
-No storage box (Forced to sell items)
-Final boss is not the most enjoyable fight (me personally)

It may seem like there is a lot of cons, but these are not game ruining nor are they that bad. Most of the pros make the game awesome.

Also: cinematics and characther designs are near flawless in the game I'd say, makes the experience much more immersive.

 *So lets talk about Good things in this game or you can say things that i like about this game*
First of all the exploration part in this game is actually amazing, its not like you are forced to explore in this game to progress. its totally optional and it does reward you for exploring new places,treasures etc.
Combat is far more improved in this game than RE7 although both games have same mechanics but in RE village you can upgrade your movement speed,health,damage reduction by making recipes in dukes kitchen which is a very nice touch and the 3rd person update is really cool too.
Lets talk about story in this game which is pretty good i'm so glad that Ethan's saga is finally over thanks to shadow of rose DLC,i really want capcom to give us something new in resident evil franchise like new story game on those forgotten RE characters like Carlos from RE3, Rebecca from RE0 or RE outbreak characters.
     *NOW TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT i DON'T LIKE OR HATE ABOUT THIS GAME*
The one thing that i noticed while replaying this game was that this game is linear as hell,which i really hate cause in RE games we are suppose to be backtracking and making difficult decision but in this game not at all.
Pacing in this game is horrible, idk what the hell were devs thinking.I mean 1/4th of this game is action packed as soon as you leave Castle Dimitresu and progress toward 2/4th this game will be a whole new game it turn into a horror game and by the time you reach for final boss fight Ethan has turned into John wick.

The diverse environments, ranging from the eerie village to the haunting castle, showcase some splendid visuals. Furthermore, the inclusion of familiar interfaces and gameplay mechanics is welcomed, especially for someone like me who isn't a seasoned gamer and prefers simplicity.

Although I waited for the 3rd person mode to be added to play it since I'm not a fan of 1st person horror in this series lately, I still got my fair share of spooks & fun out of it. Village's gameplay felt faster than 7's & RE2R's, but not as fast as RE3R's if that makes sense. A great middle ground was achieved here, even if it can still have that signature Resident Evil clunkiness to it. There are some combat gauntlets in this game that didn't feel 100% designed for the 1st person's horror experience but ended up feeling much better in 3rd person. It was overall enjoyable to play! 

The graphics aren't mind-blowing but still visually appealing; the RE Engine never disappoints! The story is also surprisingly heartfelt, much better than the dud 7's story left with me. And, of course, Village has Lady D; who needs anything else? For the most part, all of the villains had memorable personalities. I enjoyed every minute of the story, even if the middle part of Village could be more precise. Horror-wise, Village has some of the tamest set pieces in the series while also having the scariest horror moment of the last few years; you KNOW what I'm talking about if you played. 

One of my favorite parts of the RE series is how it's not afraid to get campy & ridiculous & Village doesn't hold back in that department; it was very clearly inspired by RE4 & in a few ways, also set the table for the remake we just got. Aside from the flimsy middle portion of this game slowing things down after the AMAZING castle level, I can't think of too many negatives for the base game. It's so wonderfully paced, other than the middle that I want to replay it over & over for better times.

Also, playing as Lady D in Mercenaries is AMAZING, **** that the DLC doesn't advertise itself as having to grind to unlock her instead of at purchase. -_-As for the Shadows of Rose DLC, it's much more horror-focused than Village's action-packed moments, and it was enjoyable, just not all that fun to play. I get Rose is a young girl just trying to help herself & she won't control as smoothly as an adult like Ethan, but things felt significantly clunkier, jumping right into the DLC after finishing the base game. I appreciate the horror focus & there are some genuine moments of terror in the DLC (THOSE FORSAKEN MANNEQUINS)... But other than that, you only get to fully experience Rose's powers at the literal end of the story. It feels great, but I wish we could skip to RE9 to play as a powered-up Rose trying to save the world or whatever they introduce in that sure-to-be jam-packed game. 

Overall, the DLC was an excellent addition but not necessary ****. Village is the most fun I've had with a Resident Evil game. It could be a better experience, but it does so little wrong aside from some story pacing & clunkiness that I highly encourage anyone trying to get into the series or horror, in general, to start here.

They offer a depth of realism that immerses you completely in the story, like being there in real life. The story is well-written and engaging with plot twists that are truly unexpected. Game play and story work together to deliver a frightening experience. You never know when something will jump from the next shadow to take you down. You can guess, but that doesn't change the fact that you still have to go past the shadow to get out.

Controls were familiar if you've played other RE titles or similar first person horror games. The only downside for me was how difficult it was to look around with the mouse. Even with sensitivity turned all the way up, I found myself constantly having to pick my mouse up to keep scrolling over. Annoying, but not a deal-breaker.

The combat is solid, and RE8 features all the features you'd want in a lite survival/crafting action game - inventory organization, limited supplies, crafting decisions, and lots of upgrades to move from a vulnerable twig into beast mode. The early sense in the game that there are lots of treasures to come back and find later on was very satisfying. It's fun unspooling the map and revealing all its secrets.

Acting is good, cinematic sequences are engaging, and the overall pacing felt about right. Although RE8 features much bigger maps than RE7, the playtime is about the same, and I'm not sure the game world really IS bigger ... they mostly just added lots of tunnels to walkthrough between the larger rooms and objectives. Still, it's really beautiful to look at and explore.

But damn does this game have some annoying design decisions. My least favorite was the pointless killing domesticated animals for upgrades system. It's not even hunting; you just walk up to some poor beast and blow its brains out. Felt needlessly sadistic and is unsatisfying as a mechanic.

After you explore a major area off of the hub map, you get locked out of that area -- even if you left essential treasures and obtainable meats ungathered, which can really hamstring you from accessing upgrades later in the game. Yes, I know this was the case in RE7 as well, but it felt less punitive in that game. Here, a lot of the cool things can get permanently missed until the next playthrough.

A real loss from RE7 is the survival horror elements. Gone are any real sneak mechanics. There's very little suspense or surprise in this game; it's mostly just full-on vampire hunter and such. It's still fun to play, but I really think the survival horror in the first three sections of RE7 were glorious, and I wish they had retained some of that. Instead, in this game we get far more wave shooter moments and overall run 'n gun sequences. Most are enjoyable, but I didn't care for the moments when a mini-boss battle took place in a cramped arena. Those were unnecessarily tedious.

Finally, the story is a disappointing morass of retconned elements. It's hard to make sense of anything in this game if you haven't played RE7, but the story basically undercuts that whole game. I won't give it away, but suffice to say that RE8 sacrifices a lot of the significance of the actions in the previous game to come up with some cheap plot twists. While I *love* the Village of Shadows story-within-the-story, the rest of the plotline felt like lazy writing to me.

Still had a blast running through it, but it is definitely not as good as RE7, especially if you're looking more for survival horror than action.",1706181506,1706181506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Messed up Village[/b]
Retrospectively thinking about Re Village, I can see it was very uneven. Levels are paced very chaotic. Initial running sequence > slow introduction to future problems > even slower wondering > inspection, hide and escape > grab and run. And yet every boss fight ends up with ""shoot until it dies"". And yet we can't choose who to kill next, must follow the linear story. And yet ammo management is unforgiving as always. Thanks for unbreakable knife!

Mountains. Forests. Abandoned houses. Bridges. EVERYTHING looks photo realistic and deserves to be a cover for atmospheric black metal band. 

The Village Lives. Bright day replaces foggy morning. Animals appear behind fences (free credits!). Flying creeps scared by lycans. Exploring the settlement is thrilling - newly opened doors present ammo, guns or health herbs. It's a crime we can't return to story locations!

[b]Best Mercenaries Mode![/b]
I absolutely loved Village Mercenaries! Here, you can run. RUN. Running and shooting enemies! What is going! It was fun.
Moreover - it's possible to play as Village bosses - Lady Dimitrescu and Heisenberg. Whoa! Get this picture - summoning vampire daughter, grabbing and smashing elite mobs, and occasionally using lipstick or throwing chairs into crowds.

For starters, in hindsight, this game was clearly made as not only a sequel to Resident Evil 7: BIOHAZARD, but it clearly served as a sort of ""practice project"" for their upcoming Resident Evil 4 REmake. It was pretty clear from the moment Resident Evil 2 REmake came out & the REmake train started that the remake of Resident Evil 4 was going to be a big deal. RE4 (2005) was a monumental achievement in gaming, & remaking a game as important & impactful as that would require some very careful consideration. So it's clear to me that Capcom decided to make Resident Evil: VIIlage a psuedo-precursor-spiritual successor to RE4 so they could not only figure out how to update the original's playstyle, but they could also test everything out in a game that wouldn't be held up right next to the original RE4 by the public. The result is a game that satisfies all those excellent gameplay wants & needs that made RE4 so successful while also furthering the main story & following up on Ethan Winters & his family after the Dulvey, Louisiana incident with the Baker family & Eveline in RE7. 

SKIP THIS NEXT PART TO SKIP MAJOR SPOILERS

[spoilers] The Winters' have been relocated by Chris Redfield & his team, the Hound Wolf Squad, into a remote village where they can essentially hide in the mountains safely, far far away from the deep, unending blackness of the moldy Baker house. The Winters' have spent the last 2 years recovering from the horrific events that unfolded in Dulvey, Louisiana, where Ethan's wife Mia was held on the property by a Bioweapon child named Eveline. Eveline controlled Mia & the Baker family by infecting them with Mold from her body & using the Mold to control them & turn them into horrific monsters. After a night filled with some of the worst terrors imaginable, Ethan & *Redfield finally take down the mutated Eveline & end the horrific night. (*It's not actually confirmed to be Chris, as he looks different than the Chris Redfield in RE5/RE8. It's widely accepted that this is just a poor attempt at a redesign for Chris, closer to his original RE1 design, but some theorists consider that this might be a different agent, using the codename ""Redfield"" as either a homage to Chris, an unknown family member/sibling, & one theory posited that it might be Hunk using the codename to hide his identity. It's purely anecdotal that the person named ""Redfield"" in RE7 & the Chris Redfield who has stayed consistent through every other appearance in the games are the same person.)

2 years later, Ethan, Mia, & their daughter Rose are living a quiet life in the mountains. One night while sitting down to have dinner, Chris Redfield & a squad of me bust into the Winters' home. Chris seemingly shoots & kills Mia unexpectedly, then he & his men take baby Rose & knock out Ethan. The next Ethan knows, he is waking up outside of a wrecked transport truck, bodies littered all over the ground, & Rose missing. Ethan then stumbles through the dark woods, feeling his way through shacks & thick trees, until he finally comes across an old man hiding in a pantry. After the man erratically demands Ethan be quiet & gives him a LEMI handgun, the man is suddenly viciously murdered by a Lycan monster. Ethan is then completely overwhelmed in the Village by hundreds of Lycans, including their leader Urias, a massive beast wielding a giant hammer. After being overwhelmed & captured, a bell suddenly rings out, ending the onslaught & barely saving Ethan's life. Afterward, Ethan meets an Old Hag who tells him through cryptic words that his daughter has been taken by Mother Miranda. Dead set on finding his daughter, Ethan then embarks on another horrifying quest through the darkest pits of terror, this time to save his precious daughter Rosemary before she can be sacrificed by Mother Miranda & the Four Lords. [/spoiler]

This game is absolutely amazing. I can't even begin to explain the feeling I had when searching for treasure in the Village after the 2nd or 3rd boss fight, with new keys & a new Village state. Backtracking for treasure is done in a very organic way here. Very rarely do you actually have to take the long way back to a locked chest or treasure, with new paths with new treasures usually paving the way for a round trip back to the treasure. 

The legendary RE4 inventory is here in all its glory, with the added benefit of crafting materials having their own separate page, not taking up precious inventory squares. The weapons & the upgrade system is very reminiscent of RE4, with you using Lei that is dropped from enemies or found in the world to purchase upgrades for all the different stats for each gun. Again, if you've played RE4, it's exactly like that. You can also buy attachments for each gun, just like RE4. There is a new upgrade system exclusive to RE8 where you hunt game animals in the overworld like pigs, small birds, & goats to get the ingredients to make gourmet meals that permanently increase your overall health, guard, & movement speed. It's all done very organically & if you always remember to check every nook & cranny, you will quickly notice that the treasures, upgrades, prices, all seem to fall into place in a very organic way. You do have to look for the animals, but they are sort of semi-scripted, as if you manage to kill all available animals that can be hunted, you will have just enough ingredients to get all the meal upgrades. It is an excellent experience for those of us who enjoy a rewarding treasure hunt. 

Speaking of treasure, again, just like RE4, the treasures can be either small gems, or they can be elegant combinable treasures worth tens of thousands of Lei. Being a newer title, RE8 has a lot of Quality of Life upgrades to the classic gameplay of RE4, as when checking treasures, the game will tell you when/if they are combinable with other treasures so you don't have to hold on to treasures the entire game in fear of selling a treasure before it's fully combined together. In classic RE4 fashion, you can also shoot crows in the overworld for small treasures & loot drops. When entering a new area, always remember to walk slowly & listen for the cawing of the crows so you can get the shot off before your footsteps scare them away! 

There are puzzles of course. Push puzzles, ball puzzles, scavenger hunts, keys, locked doors, special sidequests for the serious completionists, this game has it all. You might find a key to a treasure all the way across the map, then you will find that, when you get back to open the treasure, there is now a massive enemy guarding the expensive loot. Always remember to check EVERY available area every time you revisit the Village, as the game changes states between areas, & there will be new events, new treasures, & new areas to revisit that were previously blocked off from backtracking. 

All in all, I 100% recommend Resident Evil: VIIlage wholeheartedly. This game was a ton of fun, & to be honest I have 100% completed the game 4 times now, once on Casual, once on Normal, & twice on Hardcore. It is a modern day classic, & in my humble opinion, fits right in snugly in my shelf of Resident Evil games, both physically & metaphorically. This game is the culmination of every fun aspect of every past Resident Evil title, while playing as the very likeable Ethan Winters & living through his amazing story of a loving father putting it all on the line unabashedly to save his daughter, whom he loves more than life itself. Any parents can instantly relate to the deep-seeded fear of having your baby snatched by psychopathic monsters, & would do exactly as Ethan does & charge in headfirst to get her back.

Sadly, [i]Resident Evil Village[/i] failed. And I know, I know, [i]""Weird slav man, who haveth a glorious moustache and a smile that brightens up even the blackest abyss, this review of yours has a blue thumbs up, yet it failed? Que?""[/i] Well, thank you. But yes, [i]Resident Evil Village[/i] did fail... in being a good survival horror game — [b]still a damn good action game tho.[/b]

So, let's talk about it.

[h3][b]Remember, no horny[/b][/h3]
Village picks up shortly after the last game. Ethan's chilling in his new funky house with Mia, his lovely wife, and Rose, his baby girl, all the way in Europe. Life is good for our boy, as he's far away from all that mold shenanigans. Anyway, [i]pew-pew-pew, punch, baby grab, car crash,[/i] and [b]bam![/b] Ethan's now staring at a giant medieval castle which looms over a small village and has but one thought on his mind, [i]""Where the heck am I?""[/i]

Oh yeah, and he also needs to find his daughter, Rose.

This is a return of the cheese, and lots of it, with outlandishly ridiculous backdrops and villains. And I didn't really care for the main baddies and their silly monologues, except for Lady Dimitrescu. There was just something different about her. Something [i]big[/i], voluptuous, and arresting of my gaze, but I couldn't quite grasp them.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2996106328
And after two games of seeing him flung around like a prop, Ethan grew on me like mold on a stale loaf of bread. Once again, without hesitation, he runs head-first, bare, into a burning building as the fires are being extinguished with gasoline, risking life and limb for those he loves, laughing in the face of death. And that ending... just [b]perfect[/b], that's all I'm gonna say.

Presentation-wise, [i]Village[/i] is a sensory blessing. I don't even need to worry about RE Engine delivering the goods — [b]it's a done deal.[/b] The design of the characters, enemies, the sheer amount of gore and other nasty effects are just incredible. I feel blessed to have my sight, so I can enjoy the brilliance of the RE Engine.

[i]Capcom's[/i] audio game is also on point, with every voice actor doing a great job, especially the villains. They really doubled down on the cheesy delivery and corniness. I liked it. As for the sound effects, look, my ears busted a nut every time I pulled off a headshot on one of the enemies in the game. Do with that graphic imagery what you will.

Now, onto the gameplay.

[h3][b]Spreading American culture in Europe[/b][/h3]
With a more significant focus on action, the freedom arsenal had to expand. And it did. With many guns at his disposal, Ethan effortlessly spreads the gospel of the freedom church, whether these residents like it or not. [b]Shooting still feels meaty[/b], with heads exploding like pinatas, showering me with all their juicy, gooey brain pulp if I'm standing in the splash zone, and I always am!

The pew-pew did stay the same, with only the [i]""parry""[/i] mechanic being new. You can now push enemies away by quickly pressing the block button after an enemy attack lands. So, not really a parry, but also kinda is... Anyway, other areas of the gameplay were slightly tweaked to complement this shift in focus from survival horror to action.

For one, [b]you can now upgrade every gun's stats[/b] (damage, reload speed, etc.) and even outfit them with [b]special attachments[/b], improving their quality. But guns aren't the only thing you can enhance. A delicious meal will not only quench Ethan's appetite for some good fucking food but improve his health, stamina, and so on. And all you need to do is find some wild game and bring its meat back to the Duke — [b]he'll cook you up a fancy meal in a jiffy.[/b]

[b]Resource management[/b] is no longer necessary, with the game showering you with items. And the famous inventory management mini-game returns, with Ethan carrying one spacious man purse. It can hold many items, big and small, and I got to play tons of Tetris, rotating and shifting my things around, all in the name of having everything compact and my inventory looking clean. Pure pleasure!

[h3][b]We're going to Villageland![/b][/h3]
[b]The game resembles a theme park[/b], with Ethan, the (un)lucky kid, getting to enjoy all the fancy rides. So, each level will have its own tale to tell, and will do so on its own terms. [b]The game doesn't have a single concept for every level.[/b] It loves tinkering; each level will deliver a different experience than the one you just beat. One may be super scary, while the next will douse you in water, probably also guts. One may even require you to look inward and start asking yourself the big questions, [b]""Do I have a giantess dominatrix fetish?""[/b] [i]—Yes...[/i]

But, to not spoil what awaits you, I'll briefly summarise the first level, excluding the village (hub area), to tease you a bit.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2993033059
[b]The castle section blends spooky and action[/b], not committing to full-on horror, like one later level, only flirting with it occasionally. And a [i]Resident Evil[/i] map not interconnected as heck is like going to a slava in Serbia and not drinking rakija until you see your ancestors. You just don't do that. So, it's good to see the castle section deliver in this area.

But this is also home to a few horrors and Lady D, who stalks the halls. She was hunting me as I leisurely roamed her residence, breaking stuff (some on accident, I swear) and looking for that next key story item.

And I'mma be honest, while she thicc, [b]her AI also thicc[/b], if you catch my drift. It's super easy to avoid her (not that I wanted to). She doesn't even have an [i]Ethandar[/i]... it's like a gaydar but used for instantly finding Ethan instead of hunky men. So, without one of those, unless I made eye contact with her big... eyes, yes, those, she wouldn't know I was sniffing the air behind her. And with the castle having plenty of rooms, some of which she can't even enter, despite it being [b]her[/b] castle, avoiding her was easy.

So, while Lady D's presence made [i]something[/i] rise, it wasn't the tension.

Thankfully, my biggest issue with [i]Resident Evil 7[/i] was addressed as [b]Village boasts excellent enemy variety.[/b] Fighting the same three moldy boys just didn't please me, but [i]Village[/i] pleased me — [b]I'm pleased.[/b]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2993516311
And [b]most levels introduce a new enemy[/b], giving combat a new spin. I now had to learn how to deal with this new, different foe from the ones I faced previously. [b]There are even hecking mini-bosses!?[/b] And boy, do they like eating bullets, love 'em, in fact. But feed them enough lead, and they'll eventually end up dead.

But what about them big tidd- I mean, big bosses... Yeah, they're pretty big. Definitely above 5'11''. And while still relying on the lazy [i]pump-and-dump-my-load-into-the-boss'-weak-spot[/i] strategy, each had a cool little gimmick for me to do, which made these fights fun. There's even a fricking mech fight! It was just a blast to blast these big baddies.

So, to end this high-quality review, a conclusive answer to the question, [i]""Is Resident Evil Village good?""[/i] must be given.

I dunno... [b]it's fun tho.[/b] And you know what rhymes with fun — [b]gun...[/b] And you use a gun here. So, make of that what you will.

[i]To see me ramble about Shadows of Rose, the post-launch story DLC, then check it out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sv_Prolivije/recommended/1731080/]here[/url]. [b]But be warned, it contains major spoilers, for the base game as well.[/b]

The game has a great art style. All the Victorian-themed locations with breathtaking visuals, both in and outdoors, The village, the Dimetrescu castle, the surrounding forest. All of the locations are somehow unique, and carry distinctions from one another. Even the weapon visuals are designed in the same style. Engravings, color palette – they definitely feel like they belong to this world.

The engine, first-person perspective and combat system are the same as in RE7, with minor tweaks. Kudos to the developers - the game works smoothly even on my outdated GTX 960!

The gameplay has become smoother, there is more variety in weapons, almost all of them are useful in one way or another. Fighting different monster-mutants with your various arsenal is pretty fun. The weapon upgrade system is almost identical to RE4. And the crafting system is more like the one presented in RE7.

Exploration is pretty entertaining, but I didn’t appreciate that you mostly find money instead of some unique items. That sometimes felt like a lesser reward for my efforts. Might be personal though.

The replayability and additional modes are nice additions too. I personally enjoyed NG+ mode and completed the game like 3 times in a row. And all of the walkthroughs were equally enjoyable.

As for the story, well, it’s typical for resident evil. Yes, it is more down-to-earth and personal, compared to the ones before Ethan Winters became the main protagonist, but still quite predictable.

You can see this title takes a lot of inspiration from [i] Resident Evil 4 [/i] and if anything the Remake of that solidifies it in how to approach this title. 

As its namesake, the main HUB of this game is a Romanian Village. You return playing as Ethan Winters, the new RE protagonist who was introduced in RE7. You can see he had ended up with Mia Winters regardless of the baggage she had brought from the 7th Installment (if anyone was Team Zoey, I am sorry, I was conflicted about that choice as well). This game made me realise, in my least bias, that Ethan is one of the only people who can love and accept Mia. She was a jerk in RE7 and caused Ethan and so many people a lot of problems.

However, Ethan is more interested in building a life with her and even trusts she is private or closed off on certain things despite their history. Mia and Ethan now have a baby, Rosemary Winters. They kind of consider her a miracle and I think it is because of all Mia and Ethan went through in RE7 and I think it is simplified they were worried if The Mold made them infertile or caused mutations that would consider basic reproduction a risk. 

 However, all the events in 2017 Dulvey, Louisiana, has shaken Ethan to the core. He is not the same naive, optimistic person. Rather, he even says ""It is not paranoia if they are really out to get you."" He is scared for himself and his family and this creates some frictions with him and Mia who, despite being a key proponent to Dulvey, is somewhat over it.If you played RE4 Original and RE4 Remake you can see how Leon had changed significantly after the events of Raccoon City in RE2. A similar shift has happened to Ethan, he is no longer inexperienced and not the shy and passive systems engineer from 2017. Things go South, when Chris Redfield, someone Ethan trusts without a doubt, comes into his home and kills Mia Winters and kidnaps Rosemary, his daughter. These are not spoilers, this is the setting of the game as showcased by Capcom. 

Ethan is SHOCKED at Chris's betrayal and wants to find his daughter again who is further kidnapped by a group of mutants in an isolated Romanian village run by this weird Prophetess/Saint of a Black God named Mother Miranda. Hence, [i] Village [/i] is you, playing as Ethan Winters, uncovering the treacherous secrets of this remote Draculinian place in out of nowhere. I would say the atmosphere, ambiance and setting is quite GOOD for this kind of game. Unlike the heated and fetid swamp backwaters of Louisiana, Ethan now is in the arctic cold of Romanian Winters (his namesake) and must adapt to the weather and dangers that have come into this place. 

[b] GAMEPLAY: [/b] The game is designed around Stoker like symbolism, Romanian myths and iconography. It is Gothic in nature and blood and viscera play a deep role in creating the environments but also enhancing levels of fear, immersion and play. Unlike the visceral entanglements of the virus you have seen as large massive sacs of putrid flesh in RE2 Remake, [i] Village [/i] takes its influences from the medieval and European imagery of dungeons, torture devices and torment. It also has amazing artwork and paintings to heighten that kind of atmosphere and give it an architectural narrative. 

Speaking of architecture, this game is a visual feast. From Castle Dimitrescu and House Beneviento, you can see the creators have shaped it as a tour de force and to show the graphical excellence of the RE Engine. Even though this game was released in 2021, you can see that it has a lot of craft and care that still stands up today. The ambiance and cold of the Village, of castle walls and the houses, all beautifully detailed, are also somewhat hauntingly beautiful. You feel Ethan's sadness and isolation and as you play him in a village surrounded by werewolves and mutants, you feel his pain and dread. 

Gameplay enhances this with Ethan having thrust in cruel and unforgiving situations. His reactions to them are not like Leon, Jill and Chris. They seem to a mix between Claire and a younger Leon, in that he shows shock more often and despair, reminding you, underneath it all, Ethan is still a software guy who is way over his head. It actually makes him more relatable and enjoyable to play at times given that he is not trained exclusively by BSAA and also FBI or is not a cop in any shape or form. The enemies are well detailed and you can see that the first person view is meant to show you their nasty physiques and blood drenched mouths. As European lore is more into this game, the 'zombies' are more Lycans (werewolves), Vampires (mutants) and bizarre beings who fly and swim. They are a far cry to the non-intelligent zombies of RE2 and an upgrade to the Ganados of RE4, having more concentrated behaviour and abilities. New Game + allows you to explore the village more and get tons of goodies as weapons and such!

[b] CHARACTERS: [/b] I am not going to lie. I was never really a fan of Ethan Winters. I found him lacking in certain ways that Chris, Leon, Jill, Ada and Claire were not. Hell, revamped Carlos and Luis is WAY interesting to me. I noticed it also did not help that first person hides a lot of nonverbal stuff about Ethan. So, the new third person addition is awesome. It allowed me to like Ethan more and the secrets surrounding him are also quite appreciated. I loved that Capcom added that twist and I was waiting for something like that in the RE franchise. 

Though, I would not input so much into other characters aside Chris, Mia and The Duke.  Mother Miranda is very one dimensional. Even though she has a rich history apparently in this new RE mythos, she is annoying and kind of makes less sense than Wesker, Birkins and Spencer.  This is a trend in Capcom villains I noticed in their animated movies recently as well.  Miranda has the same sort of appeal as the main baddie from [i] Infinite Darkness [/i] Netflix show. Just there to be culled by you the gamer. Too much powers and less 'meat' to her motivations. 

The Lords, her 'children', are also quite forgetful in a way. You wish to learn more about them and their motivations but you can forget them. They function as obstacles to get to Rose rather than characters in their own right. Disappointingly, Lady Alcina Dimitrescu, who was the game's promotional villain, seems more like that, an ad hoc poster than a character.

Now, in [i] Shadows of Rose [/i] I have to say, older Rosemary Winters, leaves an impression on you. She is very complex and actually has complicated feelings and emotions. You can see her childhood was hard and she pines a lot for acceptance but is not really valued by ordinary people. I get the sense she is a kind of character who we will see more in the RE universe and I am grateful for it. Maybe, I am being a bit too hopeful, but I would want some of the complex philosophical questions RE putting out there to be fleshed out than just binary black and white. 

[b]  LORE: [/b] Lore needs work I think RE has a lot of ideas but does not wanna give them ALL at once. This a problem in modern gaming in general. Before, Games were not made by AAA studios and taking a franchise approach kind of ruins the storytelling process so I hope Capcom works on this. 

Overall, I will give [i] Resident Evil: Village [/i] an 8/10. I think it does show Ethan's (later on Rose's) journey from being unsure about themselves and the world, to being more formulated.

Now there are vampires and werewolves in a modern zombie bio-horror franchise, because that makes sense. It's a continuation of the shitty 7th instalment in the franchise, and instead of American hillbillies we now have European ones. Yay!!!

You'd think the setting would be cool, but the game is just a rehash of Resident Evil 4, with a meh story that has been ripped from multiple sources. Zero creativity. I guess aliens are next. Better watch out Ubisoft, Capcom is coming for your ideas next. 

The game mechanics don't fit the narrative, i.e the vendor is somehow tolerated even though he is literally fuelling your ability to commit acts of terrorism. 

They forgot the horror aspect. Most jump scares are predictable and what should be scary, is just funny. I actually laughed at some instances. I guess when you mix modern guns with Ye-Olden-Times, it just doesn't work. Where is the sense of dread and feelings of terror? And again, the game has super fugly, uncanny valley characters. I genuinely don't get the high praise for this. 

Lastly, you should avoid it and any other game by this developer. 

They tried to sneak in drm to Revelations 1 that prevents mods and will impact performance. They will do this to every single game, even ones released decades ago. Not to mention, who knows what kind of data harvesting they have planned, maybe social security numbers, personal id's, credit card numbers, banking details, passport info, etc.

Would you trust this company with your personal info after they had a data breach just in the last few years? How about one that retroactively takes away your enjoyment? How about one that has a history of installing a literal rootkit into your system that enables a backdoor into your computer?",1705280308,1705290744,False,2,2,0,0,True,False,False

They are generic horror games which use the name ""resident evil"" for more marketability to sell extra copies to an audience who were never fans of the series to begin with. It has nothing to do with the gameplay, story, characters, or themes of resident evil. The writing and tone does not fit with the series. They ruined chris redfield and ethan winters returns as the same awful character he was in 7. The DLC is laughable with rose having magical powers and such nonsense.

but after playing the entire story on hardcore, I stand corrected. While dragged down by its lack of replayability (also don't play Village of Shadows, Hardcore is the correct difficulty), this game is just absolutely excellent. At first I *did not* get the combat system at all. Seriously. To this day I have trouble articulating how it's good at all. Really, truly, it's entirely functional. It gets the job done.

Really it's the set pieces that make this game - and the combat that does just enough to compliment them. You're just powerless enough to worry about how to handle any situation, but the combat system enables you to do exactly enough to get the job done. It's just a perfect blend of helplessness and function.

This game is so fined tuned. From the running speed, to the area design, to the enemy design - it's just perfectly balanced to create an immersive horror experience. It's very hard to articulate how a combat system more basic than 4, 5, 6 (anything's simpler than 6 :P) can work so well - but it does.

I played RE Village when it released day 1, and the DRM (denuvo) gave me nothing but a stutter-filled experience when I started firing my weapons. It was not a pleasant first experience, so I can only imagine it's going to be the same if not worse by having two DRM tools running in Capcom's games.

I refused to play RE7 and RE8 for a LONG TIME, because I think RE7 and RE8 is a reboot of the series. Since I do not like to play horror games, thus I am not interested at RE7 and RE8. I WAS WRONG.

RE8 is an amazing Resident Evil game, everything I like about Resident Evil gameplay is there. And RE8 is not a not a reboot, the story is connected to the old games.

Graphically is impressive, and optimization is top notch. It’s good looking and easy to run, black magic!

And this game is scary, the main story is OK, the most scary moment is in the DLC: Shadow of Rose. The “don’t let the mommy catch you“ part is the peak of horror(at least for me). I don’t want to spoil this, just want to say the design is genius. I literally have to play a youtube podcast during this part on my second playthrough, because I want the sound of people taking in the podcast to make me feel easier psychologically. That’s how scary this part is.

RE8 took me 32 hours to unlock all achievements, and I bought his game for 20 dollars, I think it’s worth it.
Now, I am ready to play RE7.(Just waiting for the sale)

This game is so good. I sometimes think it doesn't really exist. Like I had a dream about this game. And that's all it was. A dream. But then I wake up and remember that it is real. And it is amazing. Capcom really understood that the franchise was lost after RE4. Five and Six just were not scary, and people barely cared at all about the story anymore. They REvived the franchise with RE7. And managed to give us a game that is story and gameplay sequel to RE7. This game manages to recapture the magic and adrenaline rush we felt when we first got RE4 back to the house and loaded it up.

The gameplay is RE7 and RE4's passionate love child. There's a traveling merchant that sells you upgrades and buys things from you. THE ATTACHE CASE IS BACK. While simplified, the inventory management from RE4 is back. So people like me who like organizing their inventory may have to see a doctor for an arousal lasting longer that four hours. 

Speaking of lasting longer than four hours. The only thing I don't like about this game. Is that it is really short. There are five major areas in the game. One is full stealth and puzzle. One is a drawn out boss fight. One is mostly there for optional exploration. The first and last areas are more like the mansion from the first game. But the game can be completed in 5 hours. It really leaves you wanting more.

Capcom yet again listened to the audience and this time around, you will be fighting more than three types of enemies. It just warms my heart to know that there are still people out there who care about making good games and listening to feed back...okay, well. They ruined the RE3 remake...but no one's perfect.",1642700063,1705097353,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil is my favorite horror game franchise. RE7 brought it back from near death and rejuvenated hopes for the then struggling series. Sadly I can't exactly say the same for it's sequel. Resident Evil: Village is in no way a bad game, but it's scaled down horror elements and nonsensical story throws a wrench into the great momentum this series has generated these past few years.

I believe this was the intended experience. The game could have benefited from a slower pace. The first half of the story felt a bit too fast. I was left disappointed by how quickly the most advertised and hyped character was just swept aside. This ended up making some characters come off as shallow and uninteresting. The second half of the game, however, is paced extremely well. I just wish I could have spent 10-20% more time in the vampire game I was expecting. Overall, on par with RE7 and good sequel.

After Act One, I stopped being horny and was just straight up scared. I beat Alien Isolation on max difficulty and assumed this would be a cakewalk in comparison. I was partially right, I wasn't TERRIFIED but I cowered in hidy-holes and procrastinated walking down a hallway for an hour because I no longer had my emotional support shotgun. RE7 WAS terrifying, this was a step down in that regard. 

The atmosphere and visual storytelling is top tier. This is one of the two W's eight takes over 7. I felt like a lone rat scurrying form place to place, always at risk of getting pinned by one of the cat's many claws. The world is beautiful and unsettling. I prefer it over the bayou.

Combat, what this game lacks in fear, it more than make up in panic. Overwhelming forces constantly kept me on edge. I never knew where an enemy was going to pop up and on higher difficulties a single hit will put you on the brink of death. The bonus content, additional orders, is nonstop action combat, and unlocking the special knife is a challenging but worthwhile quest. Additional orders alone is worth getting the gold edition for. The Rose DLC isn't bad either, not great but not bad.

Overall, get this game on sale so the gold edition is worth it. Otherwise, just replay RE7 and RE4. It's not the best game in the series but it's far from the worst.",1704074845,1704899364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The funnest for me was speed running/ completing the game with a knife only. The only portion of the game I didn't really enjoy was the Score Attack arcade version of the game, mostly because I needed to look up guides on the most efficient ways to get S+ ranks for the achievements, which wasn't all that fun.

TL/DR: It's a fun game, but it's not very scary, definitely less scary than RE7. There was one part of the game that was very scary (didn't rely on jumpscares as it's only horror element) and it was way too short IMO, as well as the final boss fight. I would recommend this game but only at a discounted price. Although it has A LOT of content, a lot of it is extra and I would not spend $40 to play the main story of this game.

  I want to start out by saying that my only experience with the Resident Evil franchise is games 7 and 8, so I'm not deeply attached to the lore or anything of that sort. My review is talking strictly about this game and comparing it only to RE7 (base game: I haven't played any DLC's), as that's the only other RE game I've experienced.
WARNING: RE8 is a direct sequel to RE7, and as such, my review WILL have spoilers for RE7 included that I'm not gonna block. I'll block any spoilers for RE8 that are in my review, but keep in mind that I'm only going to include mild spoilers such as the very start of the game or main characters that you meet, not actual plot points of the game. I know some people hate spoilers of any kind tho, so I wanna be courteous.

[h3] Story [/h3]
  You play RE8 as Ethan Winters, who is also the main protagonist of RE7. Without going into too much detail, after RE7 Ethan and Mia move far away from Louisiana and have a daughter named Rose. At the start of the game [spoiler] Mia is shot dead, and six-month old Rose as well as Ethan are abducted by Chris [/spoiler], playing as Ethan you wake up in the middle of nowhere. Essentially, you're wandering around trying to find Rose when you stumble upon the village, and the story takes place from there. Overall I really liked the plot of this game. It wasn't too confusing, it was sad but did a really great job of depicting how far a parent will go to save their child. The villains had great personalities and I enjoyed spending time with each of them. I would definitely recommend watching the small synopsis of what happened in RE7 at the start of the game if it's been a while since you've played. 

[h3] Pacing [/h3]
  It took me a little over 8 hours to beat the main story on normal difficulty. HOWEVER: I played the game while streaming to my brother (who has already played RE8 and knew a lot of the secrets), so he helped me out with small details that a new player would miss, such as [spoiler] shooting the sparkles in buildings that drop the crystals, where to find the animals you give to Duke (shopkeeper), explaining how to get to chests, etc. basically anything that I would figure out given enough time/looking up a guide [/spoiler]. For example, if I started walking into an area I couldn't interact with yet, he would say ""There's nothing over there for you right now"". I believe that his help shaved off a SIGNIFICANT amount of playtime from my game. It also made the game inherently easier for me, as it took me less time to get upgrades and money than a regular player would. So, I essentially played 8 hours of straight game; no wandering around, backtracking, looking up guides, etc. I personally think if I didn't have my brother helping me I would have liked the pacing of this game a lot less, as he didn't help guide me through anything significant, mostly just stuff about upgrading your weapons and looting.
  I was pretty disappointed with how they divided up the time you spend with the four bosses of the game. I'm not going to spoiler this because it isn't significant, but you spend the game in 5 different sections: the village, castle/Lady Dimitrescu, Donna's house, Moreau's reservoir, and Heisenberg's factory. As such, the four bosses (excluding the final boss, Mother Miranda) are Lady Dimitrescu, Donna, Moreau, and Heisenberg. It's debatable whether Heisenberg or Dimitrescu's section is the largest. I think Dimitrescu's section took me the longest cuz I was still being a pansy, had bad weapons, and didn't know how to play the game. Moreau's is in the middle, and Donna's section is SIGNIFICANTLY shorter than everyone else's. I'm talking like 45 minutes of gameplay at most, maybe and hour and a half if you're not very good at puzzles, while the rest took an hour or two at minimum. This was INCREDIBLY disappointing to me, as Donna's section was by far the scariest and my favorite section of them all. It's the only section focused strictly on horror, and has no survival or action elements at all.
  Overall the pacing was fine. I just wish Donna had more time in the spotlight, and that Ethan ran faster considering the amount of backtracking you have to do to get materials for upgrades.

[h3] Horror Factor [/h3]
  As I mentioned briefly above, 95% of this game only has jumpscares and a little bit of a ambiance horror. In all of the sections except Donna there are mindless goons you have to fight, which might give you a jumpscare here and there. Dimitrescu and Heisenberg both have enemies you have to strictly run from as you can't kill them, but I won't specify what. Those might give a little jump, but only for the 10-15 seconds it takes to evade them. Unfortunately Moreau has nothing special about his section horror wise that separates him from the others. The end of the game doesn't necessarily introduce anything new, but there's a lot of chaos that might cause you to panic.
  The section that was BY FAR the best in term of horror in my opinion is Donna's section. As soon as you get to a specific area in Donna's house, [spoiler] you're stripped of all of your weapons and are literally defenseless [/spoiler]. This is such a large change from the rest of the game that it immediately made me uneasy. The entire section involves a lot of dolls and mannequins, which I also find creepy. You also spend a portion of Donna's section [spoiler] in complete darkness [/spoiler], which again, is drastically different from the rest of the game and super scary. Essentially, Donna's section takes the game from [spoiler] being about fighting your enemy to running and evading them, similar to the Dad in RE7. [/spoiler].
  Overall, horror was meh except for Donna's section, which was genuinely unsettling and scary.

[h3] Characters [/h3]
  If there's one thing this game absolutely did right in my eyes, it's the characters. They're all so diverse and interesting, and I loved getting to know the details of all of their lives. Heisenberg was my favorite character due to his personality (wink) and his witts. Lady Dimitrescu is tall scary vampire mommy, Moreau is basically a cuckold momma's boy (I felt sooo bad for him), and Donna is a very mentally disturbed and scared girl. Very diverse set of villains, which I loved. Miranda was pretty cool to, but I didn't like her as much as the rest of the cast which I contribute to the fact that you spend significantly less time with her versus the other villains.

[h3] Game play [/h3]
  RE8 follows the trend of all the other RE games of being a combination of survival, horror, and action. On normal difficulty there were many times where I was struggling for resources (mostly ammo), but I think I only died a handful of times throughout the game. It's pretty similar to RE7 game play wise, just a lot less horror elements imo.

[h3] Visuals [/h3]
It's a really nice looking game. There's a lot of details in all of the areas you explore.

[h3] Final Thoughts [/h3]
  It's a great game, but I personally wouldn't spend $40 on it, especially if you only plan on playing the main story or if you're looking for a really solid horror game. I liked the game play, I liked the narrative, but overall it just wasn't scary to me.  Even though I generally dislike horror games, I was still pretty disappointed. Essentially, once you figure out the ""gimmick"" to the section you're in, any horror factor is gone (except for Donna's section, as there really aren't any gimmicks, it's just scary lol).

I didn't liked also visualisation of the monsters, lycans where very bad sketched. Everything else was great but  bad and childish screenplay ruined this game for me.... and it could be really good and timeless.

Basically take RE7 and just add in more engaging combat because Lycans do not play with you. You now have a push mechanic when enemies grab you, as well as having some Quality of Life upgrades such as being able to break boxes without having your knife out. This is coupled with an inventory system similar to RE4 where somehow you don't feel like your choking for space. Overall it's a big improvement from 7's controls and gameplay loop.

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
Bringing back Ethan Winters was an interesting choice, but it allowed us to play someone who wasn't built like a brick shit house and does this every day. It builds up a good mystery and even has a good piece of bait to keep the story going. The big bad also had a nice twist as to the implications of who she is, however, she fell a little short to her underlings. It sort of had a Farcry 3 effect where once Vaas was gone, the big bad didn't matter as much.

[h1]The Visuals:[/h1]
Gorgeous, with their scenery and enemy models. The Lycans were indeed top tier and some of the enemies looked like they came out of Bloodbourne which was a welcome change of pace. This is probably the strongest aspect of this game, and somehow outdoes it's other RE Engine predecessors, which is quite the feat since they are all using the same engine.

[h1]The Sound:[/h1]
The voice actors did an excellent job of making the experience feel magical. They really sucked me in and kept me locked in immersion so hard I forgot this was just a game and not a real exchange at times. The sound effects are truly satisfying and terrifying all at the same time. The music was that and I could not remember it, but it did it's work well.


[h1]The Experience:[/h1]
This game was both not what I expected but also exactly how I imagined it would be. This is gives me hope for the future of Resident Evil in terms of an ongoing story that doesn't rely soley on it's remakes. I am glad they are making those remakes, but I am also glad they are looking to make solid titles for the future. This new vision for Resident Evil is one I am glad has matured to this almost fine wine of a game series. This is an obvious recommend for the game.

I played this game on PS5 on release and after about 3 years I finally played it again on PC in the new third person camera view and I truly think this game is very underrated and under appreciated, at least by hardcore RE fans. Resident Evil Village does a great job implementing all of the best qualities of the Resident Evil games that we all love. 

The level design was incredible in this game. One thing that I think makes a Resident Evil game amazing is the level design and utilizing the different areas to their fullest extent, which is something I think the OG Resident Evil games mastered and Capcom seemed to forget for over a decade after RE4. Capcom redeemed themselves with recent titles, specifically RE2 Remake and RE7. RE2 remake specifically with the RPD section did so well with this and forcing the player to back track constantly to find clues, solve puzzles or complete objectives while combining this with horror elements. Village does an amazing job providing incentives to go back and search areas you were at before to find things you may have missed and implementing things like secret boss fights and new loot. 

Some of the puzzles in this game were trickier than we've seen in recent RE games and I appreciate the effort they put into this with village. OG RE games had some of the most difficult puzzles and it felt refreshing to feel lost again in an RE game. 

Horror elements were strong in this game and providing a variety of different enemy types and situations that were RNG.

The Winters story was the best in the series with RE7 and Village. RE has never been known to have great stories so it felt good to see them put so much effort into it.

The medieval theme was beautiful and so well done.

I think RE Village is easily top 5 in the series although I know hardcore RE fans will lose their mind over this.

--------------

1. This doesn't strike me as a Resident Evil zombie game. It seems more like a Lovecraftian story. I'm not complaining (much), just commenting on it. The bad guys seemed more like fairy tale horrors than zombified. (In fact, there aren't any zombies in this game at all.) There are werewolves, witches, fish men, cyborgs, giants, etc. etc. .... it's just a different genre.

2. Ammo and supplies could be more plentiful, but the shop feature seems to fill in the gap for the most part. 

3. Some of the puzzles and obstacles need improvement. The most glaring example of this is where you have to change the order of six cylinders in a music box so you can gain access to a door key in it. All of the parts look the same, so it's hard to figure out which order to use. Another example would be in Moreau's Reservoir. Here, you have to throw some switches in order for pieces of a bridge to rise up out of the water so you can reach a little island in the middle. The issue is that the bridge pieces will drop back in the water after a few seconds and there's just not enough time to throw the switches and make it to the other side. A few extra seconds would have spared me countless nights of swearing to the Heavens because I couldn't finish this part.

4. The story was excessive, to say the least. The cutscenes go on for WAY too long and reference things from previous titles that just don't make any sense if you haven't played them. The whole story seems to almost have a strange ""lost in translation"" feel to it, like when you watch a subtitled foreign film and it's just too difficult to interpret. Fortunately, you can skip cutscenes.

Forget tactics, munition conservation, puzzles, no this has a cheap shooter feel and gore, lots of gore and disturbing images because just like modern horror movies instead of actually making something good they will just produce something so shocking that it can actually get a reaction out of desensitized modern gamers and that seems to warrant an overwhelmingly paid for review rating because this game is just not good.

This game... isn't very good.  Oh, don't get me wrong; it's not BAD.  There's a fair bit that they did right.  The environments are suitably creepy and the graphics are good.   The problem is; it's basically RE4, with a less interesting protagonist, mold in stead of bugs, and less satisfying combat.  Oh, there are other differences; after all, it's in Romania, which is totally different from Spain!  Sure, there's a run-down village, a big castle, a merchant, and all that, but it's different, okay?  The major issue I have is this; the RE4 remake makes it clear that someone who works with the franchise understands having weapons that are just FLAT OUT better than the weapons that use the same ammunition is not fun.  The LEMI is completely made useless by the 1911, and the 1911 is made completely useless by the Vz. 61, or whatever they call it.  There's simply no reason to use anything other than the best weapon.  I also don't care for the (admittedly tense) Beneviento house.  Don't get me wrong, it was fun the first time through, but between just having some weapons flat-out better and that section bringing the pace of the game to a grinding halt while the protagonist works through his fear of fatherhood; it removes virtually all replay value for me.   Which is what this series has mostly been about.  Oh sure, they tried to make up for that by adding unlockable weapons, but guess what?  Those are either a joke weapon (the gyrojet pistol), a totally better than the magnum automag (or a revolver that fires rifle rounds), or... an automatic rifle.  They're also kind of boring.  Also, I pointed out in my original review that the ""Not a hero"" DLC for REVII proved that ADS is possible in the engine.  I don't know why they just did the tightened reticle in first person rather than having the character use the sights.  Which is another issue; you don't need to aim to shoot, although given the speed of the basic enemies I see why they went that way.  In any case, not the best RE game, and not one that I can really recommend, with the benefit of hindsight.",1623803253,1704460665,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game best depicts the “horror” genre; it is not oversaturated with jump scares, scary music, or darkness.  Each character is unique, with their own story, and frightening in different ways.  I would like to be like Miss Dimitrescu, walking around my huge luxurious castle in a long dress, wearing red lipstick and hunting men.  Well, okay, let's skip this point.

The uniqueness of the game is that in addition to horror elements, it contains a plot with deep meaning.  I haven't seen horror like this often.  Basically, you go around killing creatures just to kill creatures.  The plot does not touch the soul, but here at the end I shed a tear. 

Of course, the game also has its downsides.  For example, not all glass breaks, bullet marks don't always remain, but the game is so beautiful that I can close my eyes to it.

To conclude, Ethan Winters is the best father.

The lore and series continuity is as convoluted and as contrived as ever, and I can't help but wonder if 7 could've been their chance to do a complete reboot -- it tried the soft reboot thing with a new first person perspective, a new protagonist in Winters, and taking cues from the likes of Kojima's P.T. and more recent flavours of horror (instead of originally ripping off Romero's zombie canon) but the Umbrella connection is still shoehorned in, Chris still shows up, and it still follows the Mikami formula of tension and dread in an enclosed space >> which opens up to a larger space as more puzzles and combat is laid on >> finally a climatic shoot-out in a high tech lab or some such, etc. Not that any of this matters with how loosey goosey RE can be in its own storytelling logic (and who plays RE for the story amirite).

Ethan Winters is a bit more compelling as a protagonist this time around and the Shadows of Rose DLC is a nice coda to it, to say nothing of its smart reuse of 8's assets, as I felt even Capcom knew they underutilized the fantastic Castle & Beneviento maps, the latter of which gets a chance to truly shine in its redux.

The Steam/PC version is a mixed bag. If you install RE Framework or similar mods to say, unlock the FoV, you may run into system instability like I did (perhaps caused by Denuvo rearing its ugly head if you have the DLC installed?). And really that console level FoV of like, 10, is inexcusable for a PC port in 2023. Playing on KB+M always feels off, while the controls on gamepad aren't great either (something to do with mouse acceleration or some such, IDK). Enabling RT will cut your framerate down by a lot, and offers subtle but barely noticeable differences to my untrained eye, so I'd say leave it off. Lack of Nvidia DLSS support, or an updated version of AMD FSR (stuck on 1.0), or hell, Intel XeSS is also unfortunate. Capcom will go through the effort of having sliders that show the performance impact of each setting on your system components -- great! -- but then bizarrely make you click RMB to back out of its options menu instead of using Esc, or bind Ctrl by default as a Use key instead of crouch -- wth??

Can't say I'm optimistic for RE9, knowing Capcom's history with this series, but 8 isn't any worse than previous games and is a strong, if uneven entry.",1704339365,1704339365,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also gun-play is just not enjoyable.

the gameplay isnt as fun as re4 remake but it makes up for that by being far scarier, i dont play alot of horror games and heard about this not being scary and i gotta disagree. sure some parts are more action than horror but this gave me MANY spooks and surprises throughout.

There's a lot to like about Village. The atmosphere, the enemy (visual) design, the RE4 throwbacks (only works if you've played and enjoyed that game though)...

But there are so many glaring flaws that really make me wonder how this game still comfortably sits on an ""Overwhelmingly positive"" review status.

Too much action, not enough survival or horror. The writing gets really corny at times, the plot has infuriating holes, Chris is portrayed like a TOTAL DUMBASS just for the sake of the plot... and to be honest so is Ethan on many occasions.

Then there's the Hardcore difficulty. While playing the 2 and 3 remakes on harder difficulties was fun, this one is just... ""what were they thinking?"" Enemies are just bullet sponges and hit like a truck, which would be fine if other aspects of the game were balanced so you could effectively play around that... but nope. It's like the devs just cranked up some sliders and called it a day.

I don't think it's a ""bad"" game by all means, I just can't rightly give it a ""positive"" review given how flawed a game this is. If you're going to get this game, try to get it on sale, first of all, and then either play it on Standard for your first run, or if you REALLY must play on Hardcore, then look up a guide on how to beat the first scripted sequence so you don't bash your head against a wall for an hour or more.

EDIT: Also god DAYMN the mercenaries mode in this game is a flaming hot pile of garbage. Probably the worst in the history of the franchise. Yet another reason I don't understand the unreal praise this game seems to get. But I wouldn't be surprised if most people just played the campaign and then put down the game without even checking out that mode.

Resident Evil Village is literally a sequel to Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, so, you absolutely need to play RE7 first in order to understand what's going on. It would help if you've played the earlier titles as well, as this game does not hold your hand or teach you how to play. It kind of expects you to know how to play Resident Evil and what Resident Evil is, because it just launches you right into it and I love it for that. The RE formula is pretty simple so there's really no need for a tutorial. It is a horror game after all, and it's supposed to venture a little bit in the unknown and unfamiliar. I think any RE fan would appreciate this as well, because the game flows pretty smoothly as is.

I must admit, the beginning is a little slow, but the more you play, the more I feel this game rewards you. Each new area seems to make the game more fun as you progress and find or unlock new stuff, encounter new enemies, fight bosses, overcome obstacles, and solve puzzles in each section.

All in all, Resident Evil Village is a great game to play. I don't know if it would be accurate to say it's a pure horror game, but it definitely has it's moments. There is a healthy variety of horror, action, fps, story, survival, and atmosphere with this game that makes it a very well-rounded experience that you will want to play again and again. 

In my opinion, RE VILLAGE feels like it's own game mixed in with elements from the original Resident Evil, RE0, and RE4 especially. If you like any of those games you will like this one for sure. I wouldn't say it's the best Resident Evil title of all-time, because the first one still takes the cake for me, but it's definitely up there in contention for top 5 or even top 3. Resident Evil Village is an absolute must if you're a fan of the series or just looking for a fun game to play!",1703923729,1703989172,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Great game, interesting gun-play and mediocre story if it stands alone without resident evil bio-hazard. It has replay-ability for completion and new op runs 
The reason why I would leave a mix review is that its the buggy mess that is the save file system, as it can sometimes brake half way through a playthrough, permanently ruining auto-saves and making you have to get good to not lose 1-3 hours of progress that would normally be around 5 to 10 minutes of progress if the auto save worked properly. Also, verifying files can just erase the saves permanently.

I avoided this game for about 2 years because quite frankly outside of a few aesthetic choices, the game looked pretty boring. Having played through the whole thing now, I can say it's not as boring as I expected. As games in general go, it's a bit flawed but pretty good, but as RE games go it's just kinda mid. Honestly I'm 90% sure people just meat ride Village because it's the slightest tinge scarier than RE 5 and 6.

So in regards to story and themes, this game's all over the place. It tries to recreate the vibes RE4 had by redoing a lot of scenes from that game while also trying to expand the enemy variety beyond just zombies, giants, and bugs by taking inspiration from Werewolves, vampires, bog monsters... I think you get the idea. As far as ""Civilians who find themselves suddenly in the thick of it"" protagonists go, Ethan's reactions and confusion are at least plausible and potentially realistic if nothing else. Frankly only a small handful of moments in the game are actually properly scary (that baby can fuck right off), and I think this is mostly because it lacks the nuance that games like RE4 had. RE4 wasn't scary just because you were fighting freaky monsters in a forested village and ancient castle, it was also scary because of little things like the creepy synth music sounding haunting and unnatural, because of things like the bug monsters and regenerators looking inhuman and making you question if you could even win in the first place, because you yourself were infected as well and were essentially a ticking time bomb even if it didn't reflect in gameplay. In Village, you have what? Lady D? Who looks pretty much like a normal human albeit pale and abnormally tall? The majority of people just fap to her rather than fear her. Most of the time the game just relies on gore to try to scare you, and frankly that isn't scary, it's just gross...

Gameplay-wise there's very few actual flaws at all. Most of the flaws that are present are from the puzzles themselves. They're all pretty easy to be completely honest. I got stumped a few times, but those moments were rare. The levels also aren't super open either, they mostly just loop back into themselves to progress. If you've ever played the indie FPS known as DUSK, you know what I'm taking about. The level design uses the same rules as DUSK, which isn't bad by any means, but that doesn't make the level design open with choices and freedom. Also, most of the time, the enemies you face will be the same werewolf-type enemies you encounter in the village areas. The few major enemies that deviate from that that aren't bosses are the gargoyles, some cellar zombies, and some mechs. The biggest flaw with this enemy roster is that it's short which makes it a bit repetitive, otherwise it's fine and the enemies are fun to fight. The crafting system doesn't really have much to talk about, it's a simplified system similar to the Xbox 360 version of Minecraft.

I made quite a few negative comments about the game, but even so I can't outright say the game is actually bad, because it isn't. Though I probably could say it's a bad RE game, because it rarely felt like one. It felt more like a game made by a completely different studio trying to make a knockoff of RE that also took good notes and ideas from RE but didn't fully understand what made them tick. It understood the series better than 6 did at least, sure, but I still don't think it understood enough.",1703826383,1703826589,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game takes a step towards being a military shooter again rather than survival horror, something which RE7 was trying to prevent being a sorta hard reset in the series as that game was purely a survival horror experience, however, I thought this game did a good job at blending the genres together, making the game feel like a survival horror when it wants the player to be scared, while in other sequences your character will be blasting magnito in a mechanized tank. 

Game play (8/10) -
If I had to compare the game to other installments in the series, I would say that it plays like RE4, taking a lot of the game play mechanics like the merchant and the crafting system, but toned it down as you are not a MMA special forces agent. The combat system is not my favorite, but at the same time making Ethan into a one man army that can right hook enemies across the room would've drastically impacted the tone Capcom was going for in this game

Story (10/10) - 
This game probably has the best story in the franchise, there are constant twists and turns that will keep the player on their feet while not feeling too cheep or contrived. Ethan is a very sympathetic character that you really do root for while you are playing through, and the villains and monsters feel like they have a lot of development. I don't want to get too deep into the story as there would be a lot of spoilers, all I can say is to play the game and experience it first hand.

Overall (9/10)
I really enjoyed this game, and like the direction the franchise is headed in, my only worry is that Capcom may go back into making full military shooter games again like the notorious RE6, but as long as they balance their game play as well as they did in this game, it will be yet another great installment in my favorite game series.",1703794531,1703794531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was very close to giving it a 10/10 for the first few hours I played, but some glaring issues came about that kept bugging me and hindered my enjoyment of the game.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
-Resident Evil 4 inspired inventory and gameplay that is great to see return.
-Beautifully crafted, varied environments.
-An interesting story that kept me engaged which continues the events of Resident Evil 7 directly.
-Exciting combat counters with punchy weapons.
-Some intense boss fights.
-Guarding is required more often in this game compared to RE7 which keeps you on your toes.
-New characters that are mostly interesting and likeable.
-Tall Vampire Lady!!  Jokes aside, Lady Dimitrescu and her daughters were awesome.  [spoiler]I think they should have been the main antagonists like the marketing for the game made it seem.  I didn’t care about Mother Miranda as much[/spoiler].
-Some earned scares, and moments where I really felt afraid.

[h1]Things I was mixed on:[/h1]
-Kind of silly, but you can't assign the Mr. Raccoon/Mr. Everywhere charms on more than 1 weapon, the first pistol and first shotgun.  That just seemed strange to me.
-Base enemies don’t feel that varied.  They all behave pretty much the same way, but have a different model to fit the area they’re in.
-Some parts leaned too much towards the action side of things, and felt more on-the-rails than I would have liked.  I get nervous when that happens in this series, because I don’t want it to go back in the direction of Resident Evil 6.
-The game frequently told me I could press LB to push an enemy away, but I couldn't get it to work at all.  I tried several times but I just never got the timing of it.  As of 5-10-2021, I still don't have the achievement for doing it once lol.  
-Story issue: [spoiler] Chris being really mean to Ethan for the first 3/4ths of the game, and not filling him in on what was happening on despite having ample opportunity to do so.  It’s like he reverted back to meanie pants poopy face alcoholic amnesia Chris from RE6.  This is only made worse by how they acknowledge it towards the end of the game, where Ethan and another character say Chris should have told Ethan what was going on.  Yet, despite those moments of the story’s self-awareness, it doesn’t provide any meaningful reason as to why Chris acted the way he did.  It basically just boils down to ‘he messed up’ because he’s human and his emotions got the better of him.  That plot point can work very well in some stories, but it falls flat here.[/spoiler]. 
-The story moves [i]very[/i] quickly towards the end of the game despite moving pretty slowly for most of it.  It suddenly goes from 0-100 and throws so many revelations at you I found it kind of hard to keep up.
-The voice lines for Chris and Heisenberg lacked good direction at some points.  The actors did great work with what they were given.  But, there were some lines where if I was the director I would've called for re-recordings.  The most notable one for me was when Chris is talking to [spoiler]Mia about Ethan being gone, towards the end of the game[/spoiler], and he sounds like he has a Boston accent.  I felt like that delivery just didn't work for Chris's character.  There were also times with Heisenberg where his sentence inflections really stood out to me as odd, but this may have been intentional.  
-The RE4-style inventory is really cool, but it doesn’t work as well as it did in RE4.  In RE4, if you were moving an item and pressed the button to place it down over another item, for most item pairs it would swap them so you place down your currently held item and pick up the other one.  This was useful if you wanted to place a gun in a spot but there was a grenade somewhere in that space – it would put down the gun and pick up the grenade so you could put it somewhere else.  In Village, this [i]only[/i] happens with ammo over other ammo, after pressing the button multiple times.  This got frustrating fast, as my muscle memory from RE4 kept kicking in (I beat it 3 times before Village came out).  It makes organizing the inventory slower.
-The game is really linear.  There is rarely a moment where you have to stop, look at your item inventory, and think about what you have to do to progress.  The way forward is always pretty clear.  It makes the Resident Evil 4 influence obvious, and I felt like it didn’t work as well for this game.  It’s still a really well done game world and its areas flow from one to the next.  But, the no-loadscreen open world design gives the impression that it will be more like a bigger version of the RPD from RE2 Remake or the Baker House of RE7, where you’re having to run back and forth through areas you’ve opened to solve new puzzles as you acquire more key items.  I suppose this could be true about the Village in the middle, but [spoiler]you really just run through it aside from unlocking some bonuses.  Nothing mission critical is present there after the beginning of the game[/spoiler].

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
-Mia. In RE7, she was a badass double agent who put up a cute wife façade for Ethan while fulfilling her own Ada Wong-style agenda with her other secretive work.  In this game, [spoiler]she gets completely sidelined, and turned into a damsel in distress.  Her involvement in the Eveline mold project is never explained.  She does nothing noteworthy and gets no development because for most of the game you think she’s dead[/spoiler].  I wasn’t a huge fan of that.
-Sometimes after getting grabbed by an enemy, another one would grab me immediately after I got let go, before I could get a chance to guard or heal.  Uncommon, but really lame when it happened.  Broke immersion.
-We still do not get to see [spoiler]Ethan’s face, despite there being a cutscene where he is with Chris where there was a perfect opportunity to do so – we see 95% of his head, just not his face.  Literally all he had to do was look up at Chris while he spoke, but for some silly reason he just looks at the ground[/spoiler].  That really annoyed me because it felt like we were going to see it, and then we don’t.  
-[spoiler]Lady Dimitriscu (and her daughters)[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Heisenberg[/spoiler] were criminally underused.  I felt like you could’ve cut out [spoiler] House Beneviento and Moreau’s Resevoir [/spoiler] entirely to focus more on expanding [spoiler]the Castle and the Factory[/spoiler].  On that note, I found the castle to be really short despite marketing making it seem like it would be one of the game’s main recurring areas, which was disappointing since it and Lady Dimitrescu are two of the best things about this game.  I really didn’t like that [spoiler]it’s completely blocked off once you leave and you are not allowed to go back.  Why?  I could understand if the game was even more like RE4 where you completely leave the village/castle and go to another place, but you don’t.  The castle just sits there, barring you from entry[/spoiler].  Lame.

Despite my criticisms, I did enjoy my time overall with Resident Evil Village.  It is a welcome entry to the series and a polished experience.  It's an impressive feat to keep the series feeling fresh and fun despite being over 20 years old. It's not a bad game, it's a good game in its own right. It's just not a great Resident Evil game.

I know I'm stupid by not playing Resident Evil 7 before this, but its just too scary for me and I can't take it TBH.
But anyways I have still seen the walkthrough of it and I know about the story. Here is my overall experience with this one.
First of all, The voice actors are totally in the feel and this actually feels crazy with the effects. The most scariest part has to be the one with the Ugly Baby. It was so scary I had to remove my headphones and play it LoL, But yeah This thing is made very well and I love how the story keeps progressing deep into the mysteries. The ending seemed to have a little plot in the story, But I guess thats what Resident Evil was meant to be. Anyways, This is a game that I enjoyed being part of. I will complete hardcore stage in the future.
BTW, Dimitrescu is super hot and I want to see more ""Female Villains"" in the future :P

A lot of walking around, going around in circles, getting stuck, opening empty draws, getting alignment so the F button worked, and cut scenes. The screen is pretty much black most of the time so there's not much to see. 

After three hours of game play I think I killed two zombies. I spent more time watching the walk through online each time I got stuck than actually playing the game.

But now I believe Village has the most meaningful story out of any RE title and Ethan is easily one of my favorite characters. They really nailed the fairy-tale vibe it felt like they were going for while still making it feel like a Resident Evil game.
The gun-play is great and first-person view feels really nice. Popping lycan heads is one of the most satisfying things in the whole franchise. But the movement, inventory and a few other things are lacking. Stuff like,
1. Opening and closing the map while running makes Ethan come to a complete halt for a second before he starts running again.
2. Cant swap inventory items unless they are the exact same size and positioned exactly on top of each other.
3. No FOV settings in an FPS game.
4. The beginning part of the game is quite a drag on repeated playthroughs but it's whatever.
5. Can't pop the heads of certain enemy types which feels dissatisfying, since they seem most likely to have their heads blown off.

However these issues were not in RE4R so i guess they wont be a problem in future games either. All-in-all, very fun game. Might even try RE7 someday.",1703273187,1703443132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

REVIII is definitely a much better survival horror than IV and that shines on harder difficulties where you are forced to run from the enemies and not engage them. 
The first village section though it's a reference to opening of RE4 overall is more similar to opening of RE2 which is the hardest opening in the history of the series. Sadly it's one of those segments that demands from you some external knowledge to complete it, so I recommend checking a walkthrough were you to play the game on Hardcore or Village of Shadows.
Overall structure is also much better. Village and Castle offer some good old Resident Evil puzzle solving and Factory was a surprisingly good level, usually a quality drops for the last section of the game.
Bosses are fun, some are obnoxious but in the end, it's a very good Resident Evil. I liked it more than RE4(2005).
Mercenaries are sadly disappointing. New structure isn't even half as fun as the one in RE6. Which is a shame because Chris' straight punch is one of my favourite attacks in the whole series.",1703327376,1703415371,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

i played RDR2 and Elden Ring on high, this one on high settings and i didn´t even overclock anything yet, on a 1060 6gb oc and i5 6500 16gb RAM (on 1080p of course) with the asbolute most trash of a motherboard you can think off.
Nothing topped the incredible graphics of Witcher Wild Hunt up to date.
Unless developers and gpu-producers get a grip on themselves there´s no reason to upgrade shit for the next 5 years (hope we get a decent VR set with full fingermovement tracking and software that actually adapts that).
it needs you, too!!! if everyone thinks they need the newest, the best to whatever price, this fantastic opportunity will fly by!!!!! no, u do not need nvme/ssd - yes it is nice to have, but you run your games on hdd!!!!!!!!!! unless you play online permanently.
uhm, this was my rant. Resident Evil Village: fantastic game, have the same (minor) problems to understand when and what to shoot, pissed of by those (unnecessarily) labyrinthian levels and the very particular usage of the menu.
but relax, this has nothing in common with bethesda garbage. 
the game has an extraordinary atmosphere and graphics and is a blast.

Get Mikami and Hideki back onboard now Capcom while they are available. Or someone else who has the creative drive for the RE series. All the best RE games were when Mikami was in the director's chair.

I recommend to play this game however I'm giving it a negative vote because I can see how Capcom is making this slowly like a Cod survival horror game that is being made for the mainstream audience. The story is lame and the main characters like Ethan/Mia/Rose are such a bore. Dialog and acting is horrendous and not in a good way like how old school RE games were. I would like to see more cool cutscenes instead of this overrated Half-life-like pov camera system during cutscenes. The music was bland. I think the mercenaries missions and the Rose DLC is probably the worst extra content in any RE game to date.

I'm also sick of playing with this dark vignette border around my screen that Capcom loves so much. And this little FOV they gave us in this game... Capcom, if you feel the need to introduce these artificial ways to make the game feel scary, you are doing ""survival horror"" wrong... The game needed more time in the castle with the vampires. I can't believe they killed Lady Dimitrescu so quickly. She was the most interesting enemy. The end boss was horrible. The rest of the enemies were bland. I thought Magneto was gonna be cool in the beginning but nope. Jill needs to be in the game too. 

One thing definitely needs to be said. DO NOT MAKE RESIDENT EVIL OPEN WORLD CAPCOM. Making games open world ruins almost every other aspect of games. Just look at the new Zelda games as an example with its huge EMPTY world. Making RE open world raises budgets that will invite cheap ways to charge consumers for content. Then you will compete with COD and RE will be mainstreamed. Then Capcom will put too much weight into one franchise because of the massive budget needed for RE games.

Besides all that negative stuff...it was a good game to actually play however it has a lot of glaring issues. You may not initially see or notice it because of the AAA budget RE games get now. I understand Capcom needs to appeal to many people because of the massive budgets, but if they aren't careful, RE won't have an identity anymore. Also, get rid of this stupid Ethan storyline already. No one cares about any of these characters. Maybe create stories off of family members from deceased STARS members.

I swear this game is just one long masochism simulator topped by several gallons of miracle-cure disinfectant . Umbrella Corp should really patent this stuff and sell it on store shelves, they'd make a killing off it.
And this big bad thicc 10-foot vampire lady seriously needs to hire a contractor to renovate all those doorways, no clue how she's lived so long in that castle without doing some serious remodeling.

Seriously though: Really wish Steam had an indifferent rating on their site. Can't say I missed much by waiting so long to buy it but it is good for what it is.. Instead of Zombies and weird tentacle spikey zombies we get lycan/werewolf ... whatevers... that move like zombies.. Oh it also has zombies. And everything is a bullet sponge.

Very much an improvement over RE7 and their sad take on a revamped 3. Though sadly, keybindings are extremely silly as if no one on their development team has ever played a game on PC. Then again... it IS a console game and it plays very much like one, regardless of how many times they attempt to port to PC. And don't get me started on the atrocious ADS - instead you get a slightly more zoomed in hip-fire. Console devs and their abysmal dependence on crosshairs.

For the most part though, the game is pretty good and I've had some decent fun with it. 

The boss enemies were done well except for the guy that throws gears and sprockets at you. He was just annoying. They could have made an entire game out of the 10 foot thicc vampire chick though - I'd play that - everything else was bland in comparison. Except maybe the doll house, it was fun. But nothing has freaked me out more than the giant baby screaming fetus-maggot-caterpillar thing.

Sadly: Two of the best ""mini-boss"" characters in the game were lacking on screen time. They could have done so much more with their zones. Like the devs couldn't decide on which direction to go so they just went with a little bit of everything, but they could have added a lot more of a bit of everything.",1702874586,1703043674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can imagine playing this for the first time without having any knowledge or experience in the RE games and what an unique experience this must be. RE7 walked so Village could run. I experienced the same sense of twisted wonder as I had in Dark souls (3). 
The areas are extremely detailed, super immersive and varied. It feels like playing through a mix of an Evil dead type action and horror movie. There’s an element that is unique to the series that I feel can't be tied to an existing piece of media. You'll be exploring insanely tense close quarter horror to spectacular gothic setpieces, fighting off enemies that vary in behavior and size. This is what creativity and passion in the AAA space can do and I'm extremely here for it. If you're still indecisive, give it a chance. It really is an impressive true-to-gaming experience.

As for difficulty, if you aren’t as familiar with the tense and sometimes frustrating RE gameplay loop where you manage your resources and often barely survive encounters, where you just want to experience what the game has to offer without significant hicc-ups: go with standard. I often like to play games on their harder difficulties but if I’d started out with hardcore I would’ve probably dropped the game and missed out on this unique experience. I now feel more inclined to replay the game in hardcore as I’ve already experienced the game and its story.

If you are looking for the classic RE gameplay with all its (extremely) tense moments and you like bumping your head at certain sections because of it do go with hardcore.",1702985774,1702985894,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The puzzles and exploration are really well done, they reward you for visiting old areas by sprinkling new enemies and resources around. Even the main objective isn't super spelled out for you. A lot of stuff you have to figure out yourself. The snowy Romanian village with werewolf monsters is such a unique setting and the environments are gorgeous. There's 4 areas in the game + the main village area. Each location has its own unique personality, its own enemies and bosses. There's 4 bosses in the game (+ some mini-bosses), including the final boss. Each one has its own set pieces and abilities. One of the areas of the game is a puzzle + horror segment and it's easily scarier than most moments in RE 7.

I hated the inventory system and inventory UI. Give me item boxes. Having useless key items and having to scroll through to find the one you're actually looking for is annoying.

Enemies drop treasure that can be sold to the merchant from whom you can buy ammo, meds and upgrade your weapons and character. This incentivises you to kill enemies, instead of trying to conserve ammo and avoid them like other RE games. This works really well considering the more action heavy focus. It feels more consistently fun throughout, instead of being like RE 7 where the second half of the game is painful to get through.",1702489853,1702554034,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a decent variety of enemies, the graphics are good and are less blurry than RE7 which speaking of the story follows on from but is much better.

Highly recommended.",1702537585,1702537801,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will admit I saw the trailer and review when it came out, I thought it was a short 7 hr game (I took 40hrs for one playthrough) and it didn't look like my type of game, but boy was I wrong. First, I really don't play too many first person games that much, but if you get the DLC then it activates 3rd person as an option in the main game. I think playing this 3rd person made a difference to me. The concept of the new enemy types and bosses, the storytelling and voice acting was amazing. Graphics were exceptional. I really enjoyed the DLC as well. I know that Resident Evil 7 is only first person, but since that one is the prequel to this awesome game, I think I will give it a try.",1702438306,1702438306,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It starts well (albeit after a fairly long opening sequence) - the early phases of the game were great and felt like a nice blend of previous Resi games. The inclusion of a merchant character gave me high hopes that I'd get a Resi 4-like experience, but after a while the whole thing starts to rush along and essentially turns into a fast-paced action shooter, with lots of uninspiring boss fights. There were moments later in the game thtat I did enjoy, but these were brief and few. There was nowhere near enough of the exploration and puzzle-solving that I enjoyed in other games in the series, despite (it seems) trying to play with an open-world style setting.

Also, for me there were far too many first-person cut scenes. I found these very frustrating. They were not aided by terrible dialogue (and not terrible in a deliberate campy way like in some Resi games) and a rather convoluted story which didn't really hold my interest.

The economy also failed for me. I found myself swimming I resources constantly with little to worry about, but that seems to be much better in Resident Evil 4, so they've at least learned from their mistakes.

While similar in many points to its predecessor, manages to tweak the gameplay so it feels different. If you played the 7th title but would have liked more action at the expense of some of the scare factor, you might favor this one over the 7th.

Story: Direct continuation of RE 7, so I suggest playing it beforehand. 
At first, and I do mean the first few minutes, you feel like it's going to really be a continuation... You see Mia, realise which ending was cannon, become pretty happy for Ethan with his lil' baby... Then, it all gets thrown out the window and you feel forced into events that are completely unrelated to the previous entry. But eventually... It manages to reel you back in with just enough clever pulls at your heart strings and interesting character developments to make it interesting and coherent (enough). After all, it is Resident Evil, so story was never their forte, but after Resident Evil 7 and 2's remake, I expected amazing quality. So much so that I was probably being unfair.

Gameplay: The combat is VERY similar to RE 7, like, ridiculously so. The only changes are in the weapons selection and their upgrades and customisation (similar to RE 4 & 5), collectable treasures that are sometimes combinable for much more resale value (again, like RE 4), a sales person and an inventory system that is like RE 4. No need to find backpacks to increase inventory size like in RE 2 (the remake) and 7, simply purchase the bigger cases available in the in game store. There is also food/ingredients you can collect from animals which you can craft recipes from to obtain permanent buffs; health, speed, block dmg, etc. I wish the game told me earlier because I'd been selling it since it had no use. The food is finite btw so don't sell it like I did.
The game feels balanced on normal. Though I was never out of bullets, I felt the squeeze when I would miss too many shots. The areas you visit are varied, not so much in locations but more as in you'll have tight quarters one minute and have room to fight the next. A couple of enemies here, and a crowd there. An easy fight here, and an optional big boss there. It keeps things much fresher than in RE 7 where all you had was moldy fellas.

Graphics: Looks good! It's no master piece but it looks really good. Some textures looked a bit off but 99% looks like what you'd expect from any game with RE engine. It's also noteworthy that the game isn't always having you creep around at night. Lots of the game takes place during the day and outside. 

Audio: A lot of the guns sounded a bit wimpy, but then again... maybe it's just that I haven't unlocked some more powerful guns. It might also not help that I've never fired the magnum. I was saving the bullets for later... But then the game was over :( I'm one of those people that save up 99x potions and end up never using them.
The voice actors are ok, and the ambience is as good as RE 7. 

What I initially was let down by was simply that the game did not  INITIALLY feel like a horror game. It threw a few curve balls at me and whenever they were happening I couldn't see myself growing to like them. But when you take a step back and just appreciate it at its face value, the game is actually great. I think this game is very similar to RE7, but it's like the difference of opinion between COD and Battlefield... Same thing, but oh so different.

This game runs really well. It can push the hardware to the limits. I suggest using FSR with adequate resolution and limited filtering options. Otherwise - like all RE games, Village looks satisfying and runs well with support of many modern technologies.

The game runs perfectly well on Linux, with absolutely 0 issues on GE-Proton8-16 (but probably any version really). The FPS is stable, textures are detailed. I had lots of fun.

[h1] Technology [/h1]
FSR and RTX, the game allows a broad selection of settings. I think everybody can find something adequate.
Graphically it's not the Crysis of 2000s, but it was never the major point in this game I suppose. The game does look pretty and I imagine with all ""HQ"" options enabled it would present itself as one of the best looking games in 2022-2024. Great job for a RE game. Capcom has bought a Customer by delivering high quality games with great controls, animations and polished experience.

On the note of AI - it is not the brightest at the times, but absolutely sufficient. I wish Dimitrescu was a bit smarter in her castle, but otherwise everything's OK.

[h1] Gameplay/bugs [/h1]
Absolutely no issues in terms of controls or gameplay, at least if using the keyboard. Controller is also just fine (technically), but aiming is difficult. Being a mostly FPS type of game, Village just doesn't feel good without mouse/keyboard. It's the reverse Elden Ring situation...

I noticed just one bug on Linux. The mouse would sometimes go a bit crazy in the menu. Everything works fine in the game, but I would experience a jumping cursor in the shop or game's menus. Could be Proton acting up a bit or some kind of incompatibility in between the window compositor and Wayland.

[h1] Genre [/h1]
I never played RE games and started with Village. I bought a couple of different RE titles during the sales. 0 regrets. Absolutely one of the best purchases ever. The lore is great, the enemy design is interesting. Every boss is unique, has a specific style and comes in a different environment. Some of the areas remind me of different games. Having played RE 0 (Resident Evil Zero) I would say that Village is MUCH better and yet still resembles the original games from early 2000s.

[h1] Value [/h1]
100% great value. If bought on a discount then it's even better. It's one of few games that actually delivers what it promised. If you're disappointed with the ""AAA"" (more like AAA jokes) titles in 2023 then I suggest trying out RE. Additionally there is no mandatory online play, no encrypted textures or anti-cheat bullshit and the game does not require 10 different accounts. It reminded me of playing games in my childhood.

A small drawback - the game is not very lengthy, although it can be played multiple times with different difficulty settings, some DLCs etc. I would say playing it twice is the recommended scenario.

PS: Perhaps the biggest question 'not answered' directly in the game's lore is...
[spoiler] Whose child is Rose after all? It's a moldy subject, for how long did Miranda pretend to be... her mother? [/spoiler]",1701389508,1701409540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Building on the success of its predecessors, Village not only continues the gripping narrative of Ethan Winters but also introduces new elements that elevate the Resident Evil franchise to new heights of horror and grandeur.

Visually, Resident Evil Village is a stunning triumph. The RE Engine showcases its prowess with atmospheric lighting, detailed character models, and intricately designed environments that seamlessly blend the eerie beauty of the village with the grotesque horrors that lie within. The diverse settings, from the dilapidated village to the opulent castle and beyond, create a visual spectacle that is as unsettling as it is captivating.

The narrative weaves a tale of desperation, loss, and survival as Ethan Winters embarks on a quest to rescue his kidnapped daughter. Village introduces a compelling cast of characters, each with their own dark secrets, and the unpredictable twists keep players on the edge of their seats. The enigmatic Lady Dimitrescu and her vampiric daughters, among other horrifying creatures, contribute to the game's atmosphere of constant dread.

Gameplay mechanics in Village strike a balance between survival horror and action, offering a diverse range of challenges. The first-person perspective enhances the immersion, with responsive controls and intense combat encounters. The game introduces a merchant called the Duke, adding an intriguing economic element that allows players to purchase and upgrade weapons, further enhancing the strategic aspect of gameplay.

Village excels in level design, offering a mix of tight corridors, open landscapes, and intricate puzzles that keep the player engaged. The interconnectedness of the various areas encourages exploration, uncovering hidden secrets, and solving environmental puzzles that reward the curious and thorough player.

The sound design in Resident Evil Village deserves special mention. From the unsettling ambient noises to the bone-chilling roars of monstrous adversaries, the audio elements contribute significantly to the game's immersive horror experience. The voice acting is superb, adding depth to the characters and amplifying the emotional impact of the narrative.

While some purists may find the game's departure from traditional survival horror mechanics and its increased focus on action to be a deviation from the series' roots, the balance struck by Village allows it to appeal to a broader audience. The varied pacing, unexpected scares, and the constant feeling of vulnerability contribute to a horror experience that is both thrilling and emotionally resonant.

In conclusion, Resident Evil Village stands as a pinnacle in the Resident Evil franchise. Its breathtaking visuals, captivating narrative, and refined gameplay mechanics come together to create a horror masterpiece that pays homage to the series' legacy while boldly venturing into new and terrifying territory. Village is not only a must-play for fans of the genre but also a testament to Capcom's ability to evolve and redefine survival horror in the gaming landscape.",1701239212,1701239212,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The beginning was scary as shit but I loved so many aspects of this game I'm not even sure I can name them all: the exploration, the looting/secrets/treasure, the storyline, the combat, the collectibles, having a merchant like RE4, I loved it all. I enjoyed the spooky atmoshere, the music and the graphics are stunning. Not seeing Ethan's face was hilarious and even though people say he's bland, I really enjoy his one-liners. I also cried at the end so there's that. All of the bosses were interesting and different from eachother and I surprisingly enough really enjoyed the creepy escape-room like section. My only complaint is that I want more because I genuinely couldn't stop playing. I own this game on multiple platforms now and have honestly played this way too many times already.

TLDR: This is an amazing game and you should play it if you like exploring a beautiful spooky world (and looting it), shooting monsters and experience a great story with a tint of horror.",1701208780,1701208780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There were some interesting puzzles though I would've liked some more variety. Now finally, the fear factor. Playing from a first person perspective definitely upped the scares, It made it more immersive and you could see less of the surroundings so when something popped up it was actually a little frightening. The sound design was one of the main things that made the game so creepy, from the mob sound effects to the inclination of tense music everything was top tier, soundtrack definitely deserves a 10.

A good finale to the Winters saga, hopefully RE9 will actually feature Chris as the main character and start explaining all these different corps and plot points they've been hinting at or giving very little info about. 

As for the game itself, I definitely agree with the common notion that the game starts off super strong, has a really meh mid and an ok/good ending area until the final boss and cutscene.

Still personally prefer my RE games 3rd person, after two games of first person I'm definitely more OK with it than I was when RE7 launched.

Wait till the gold sale version is on sale for 20$ for the best dollar to playtime ratio.

I enjoyed the gameplay and had some good time, however the story makes no sense. Don't get me wrong, it's way better than RE6, but they keep trying to connect with the old gang to create a complex mysterious plot and it's not working. They should forget Umbrella, Jill, Wesker, Chris and assume it all was gone with Raccoon City.

As the gameplay ditched the tank controls, the plot also needs to get rid of this rotting universe and start a new one.

This is because the game provides a retrospective of the preceding story right at the start, orientating those who haven't experienced the horrors of Biohazard. Nevertheless, for a more thorough understanding and a potential connection with this new storyline, it could be a good idea to play the 2017 game.

Although it appears simple at first glance, the plot is, in fact, quite complex. Centered around a father's quest for his daughter, it harbours numerous mysteries, delving even into the history of the formation of Resident Evil's main company, the Umbrella Corporation. The unfolding narrative gains depth as the game progresses, culminating in a completely surprising outcome. Despite its intricate storyline, the game is relatively short and can be completed in around ten hours. Yet, true to Resident Evil tradition, Village conceals some treasures and small side missions, enticing the player to experience it more than once. Additionally, the return of the Mercenaries mode adds an extra layer of challenge.

In terms of characterisation, figures like Lady Dimitrescu and Salvatore Moreau are intriguing in their own right. However, what captivated testers the most was the beauty and realism of the environments. From the tense scenes within the Dimitrescu castle to the unsettling moments in the Heisenberg factory, the game maintains meticulously detailed environments throughout. In Resident Evil Village, even the unpleasant becomes beautiful. The only exception to this aesthetic is perhaps a moment in the encounter with the second boss, Donna Beneviento. Nevertheless, despite involving frightening situations, the scene settings remain impressive, justifying the horror they evoke.

Similar to any other game in the franchise, Resident Evil Village demands a considerable amount of curiosity and exploration from the player. It's always crucial to scrutinise each collected object, as some require assembly and/or disassembly to become usable. It's worth noting, however, that in this new chapter of the Capcom series, certain items boast extended lifespans. Additionally, there are regions that, despite appearing early in the game, necessitate exploration later on. This aspect brings to mind the Lego franchise, a delightful association, by the way.

To aid navigation, the map of Resident Evil Village is highly intuitive. It simplifies the indication of unexplored elements in each available area. However, its simplicity can be a real headache for players who enjoy collecting every item.

Despite a somewhat prolonged ending, all the hours invested are justified by the complexity of the story. With stunning graphics and well-developed villains, Resident Evil Village concludes Ethan Winters' journey impressively. It delights players with surprising and terrifying gameplay, featuring a beautiful moral centred around family, hope, love, and determination.

As for the Shadow of Rose additional content, the adventure, on the whole, boasts an intriguing completion time and, once again, a delightful moral of the story. Amidst some scares and tense moments, the extra story proves to be enjoyable and interesting. However, it occasionally feels a bit disconnected from the familiar reality we're accustomed to in the franchise, becoming somewhat disjointed at times. It stands out as one of the best contents I've experienced in a story-based game in quite a while.",1672650738,1700797471,True,28,4,0.741513431072235107,0,True,False,False

RE village takes all the gameplay elements that made 4 good (except for the 3rd person controls as they were obviously an afterthought added in DLC) and keeps the elements that worked in 7, albeit the game is noticeably less scary so if pure horror is all you're looking for this game takes a big step back. 

This game also has some of the most diverse locations in any RE game I've played, there are 4 fully fleshed out areas with unique bosses that all have a completely different feel and even shake up the gameplay loop sometimes requiring you to completely change how you approach the game to beat the different bosses.

There's an amazing variety of weapons as well with 3 weapons for each type: melee, pistols, shotguns, magnums, rifles, and explosives with multiple attachments to find for each.

Mercenaries also makes it's triumphant return (and with the ability to play as some of the bosses if you pick up the DLC) and is both fun and extremely rewarding for completing all the stages with an SS rank.

My only gripe is that there is no FOV slider whatsoever so unless you install REframework this game can easily make you motion sick because muh can't see means scary i guess... Otherwise fantastic entry in the series and well worth full price.",1700711548,1700711548,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A much more action focused Resident Evil game with emphasis on a more arcade-y combat, straightforward boss mechanics and even including a few horror focused sections.
Since everyone and their mother knows this game for the big vampire mommy Lady D I do have to warn you - she and her daughters are only about 10% of the entire game. So if this was a selling point to you then sorry to disappoint, and if it's the opposite then you're in luck!

Now RE4 was a somewhat controversial title due to it being a more direct transition into the action genre, with RE3 being an experimental slightly more action oriented horror game. This might feel similar coming from RE7, you will most likely be running and gunning half the time, with some sections even throwing enough enemies at you that you'd want a minigun. Which brings me to a negative point here: NG+.
In previous RE games New Game+ was a fun way to discover new unique weapons and interesting ways around encounters. Here you just get more powerful weapons of the same type you've been using before, with the one truly unique weapon locked behind a Mercenaries mode grind.
The mercenaries mode is a lot of fun, you can even find random power-ups around the levels which almost turns it into a rogue-lite, until you try to get high ranks in the Hard Mode maps though, then it starts becoming frustrating. It would be interesting to see a more open-ended mode like this, with all the maps combined perhaps, to see how a long run would look with you becoming ridiculously overpowered.

Overall a great game, if you are looking for a true Resident Evil experience you might be disappointed, but if you're fine with a bit of action in your RE games (if you liked RE4 and beyond) then you'll love it.",1620912194,1700695399,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The visuals are some of the best I have ever seen from a Resident Evil title and the characters performances are terrific. The atmosphere again I have to point out makes this game feel immersive and it really suits this title in particular. I can say the same with the enemies they went with here also, this suited really well with the environment they were placed in and the boss fights were very interesting and unique to each individual foe you face. It was well distributed between the combat and the horror so you could roam around very easy and enjoy certain parts of the game without enemies trying to attack you all the time. But this may vary on what difficulty you play on, do not quote me on that. 

. Also, I want to say that this Resident Evil might be my favourite in terms of design and appeal they worked with here. I just cannot explain enough how detailed and extraordinary the places look. To me this is what I look for in a game and it makes me appreciate the title so much more. As a result, an awesome Resident Evil in my book. I hugely recommend this game to anyone looking to play a first or third person horror. Thoroughly enjoyed it and I cannot wait to play more of these titles in the future.

I liked the game even though it had its issues like hard-locked 81 degrees FoV. It caused me to have motion sickness in the very beginning of the game to the point where I couldn't carry on playing anymore.

I had to download 'Lazy FoV' from NexusMods.com in order to fix the hard-locked FoV because Capcom didn't include a slider option for FoV in the vanilla game.

After fixing the FoV back to 90 degrees (acceptable value for first person view games), I have eliminated motion sickness. However, you shouldn't set the FoV greater than 90 degrees, because then it causes visual glitches like your view being obstructed by Ethan's character model or having a fisheye-like screen/the edges of your screen gets visually distorted as you increase the FoV. Next up, you'll want to enable manual flashlight on/off prompt which can be enabled through RE Framework tool which you can also download from NexusMods.com and after this, lastly, you'll want to remove the Vignette effect whenever you crouch, because both sides of your screen gets darker and it becomes difficult to see around. For that, what you'll need is 'Vignette Fix' from NexusMods.com

After these adjustments, you're good to go. The gameplay and story telling is just as much as you'd expect from any other Resident Evil title.

Upon completing the main story, I've played Shadows of Rose DLC, which unfolds the events after Ethan Winters' story ending. You play as Rose Winters, Ethan's daughter. But this time you are playing from a 3rd person perspective, so you get to see Rose and the vanilla game doesn't cause motion sickness. It offers about 3 hours of content on top of the main storyline which was roughly about 9 hours. (not rushed) The Shadows of Rose DLC also doesn't have the issues I've mentioned above, which the vanilla RE Village main game does.

I hope Capcom will perfect their next Resident Evil game in the series, like including an FoV slider, giving player the basic ability of manually turning on/off flashlight and removing the Vignette effect.

Overall, I'd give Resident Evil Village & Shadows of Rose both a solid 8 out of 10.",1700256775,1700323188,True,48,1,0.829162180423736572,4,True,False,False

Resident Evil: Village wears the influence of Resident Evil 4, in the sense that it's more action-focused than other games, and it has a bit less in the way of horror. It still has some scary sections, but overall it is way more about shooting than atmosphere, although it still has a great atmosphere.

My biggest knock with this game is that it doesn't let the individual sections shine, instead rushing you through them a little too fast. I really wish some of the sections were just denser and had more to do, but it is what it is.

I really enjoyed Village overall and it's one of my favorite games in the whole series. I felt like it fumbled the end, similarly to 7, but it still was a great time and one that I'll revisit at some point in the future.",1700294955,1700294955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first half of the game (until we're done with Castle Dimitrescu) is truly magnificent. The atmosphere of mystery is unreal. Then... it goes downhill pretty quickly, unfortunately. The gameplay out of the blue devolves into a blunt ""find X bad guys, kill bad guys, then kill the baddest guy"". 

Yes, the Benevento mission is still crazy good and scared the hell out of me at one point but it's the last highlight moment really.

- the main bad guy is almost completely absent from the game.
- last boss is an ammo sponge (i had to use my knife to get the W) easily over 100 rounds.

I can see why people like it. I just personally think it's bad. Especially the 1st few hrs. I didn't like the castle at all. The factory was the best IMO.

OH COME on. Then he runs around the house missing his hand and not doing anything to stop bleed out or shock all the while she's still chasing him around abusing him. How many I'm sorry and blame it on the mold can you use before you get a divorce and get a grudge? Then you find out he actually died there and is nothing but a mold man. okay then why in village dose he need a heart or lungs or circulatory system. I don't see very many molds bleeding either. So he has a child with his abusive spouse then she gets replaced by another abusive women who is also a moldie. War of the mold aye? when he regenerates whats that got to do with his clothing. who the heck mends his coat sleeve after he loses yet another limb. I'm missing 2 fingers on my left hand but hey my coat is just perfect like the day I bought it?  Oh come on. So this poor guy runs through 2 entire games being tortured and humiliated not only by his spouses but by the mobs and then even the lowest form yet he finds out he's nothing but mold. sure has nice hair and skin tone for mold. This is a horrible story infact I see nothing redeeming in it. It's not even funny is sad that anyone would go through all this hell and still be loyal to someone how dose'nt even care about him just another place to put a kitchen knife.,1700091209,1700091209,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, I was liking RE8 up until the first half. I really thought that the beginning was perfectly made and the first encounter too. But, for me, everything else has been so lazily written that it eventually got to me. 

I'll say this, though: the Dimitrescu castle and the Beneviento mansion were really well made and I have liked their structure and feel. Each room felt neatly structured, and not simply a random arrangement of objects.  Especially in the castle, I've felt that the actual storyline was being constructed accordingly. 

After that, apart from the aforementioned mansion, everything has gone downhill. Massively. To the point that it began feeling less of an horror story, but rather an average anime saga. Really. 

Dialogues got more and more cartoony, and I can't understand why. I was only laughing whenever people spoke in the second half of the game, as it felt like none of the characters were taking anything seriously. This culminated in the final battle which, even without considering the cringy part with Redfield, was definitely a chore. 

This is the worst part of RE8, for me. And, for a game that wants to be narrative, it makes me really not want to recommend it at all.

The other thing I haven't liked at all was the combat system. I mean, not that RE7 had the best gameplay ever, but here the arsenal was just too vast and pompous for a ""normal"" guy like Ethan. I wouldn't have minded it, if most of the weapons were completely useless against bigger enemies. I can't stress how many bullet sponges I have encountered. I have played in hardcore difficulty, yes, but I expected something different. Some enemies will literally make you waste mines, pipe bombs, explosive ammos, bullets... everything. A waste of time.
Not only that, but the overall worldbuilding was definitely more spot on in RE7 than here. The story is very predictable.

Excluding the bullet sponges, though, normal enemies were okay. You could kill all of them only with a pistol, if you had enough bullets. And new enemies were always presented in an interesting way, at least for me.

A worthy mention could be made for the DLCs. RE7's ones were kinda genious, here... not so much. It almost feels like a Thirteen Reasons Why + Life is Strange screenwriting, at best.

I'm upset not because the game is bad, but because I was getting invested in it and it changed structure so much that it didn't feel serious at all, at one point. If I had to make a review half into the game, it would have been almost certainly positive.

Not that RE7 is perfect. I still remember how goofy the final battle was. I can't understand why Capcom can't seem to mantain seriousness more than a couple of hours. Well, I hope that the next iteration will be more narration-focused with less flashy weapons and quirky characters. I think that, today, it doesn't work anymore as it used to in past titles.",1700085104,1700085104,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

On one hand I am glad I took time to experience RE7 first, but on the other (and let me tell you, this game really makes you appreciate the fact that you have both) this game really spoke to me. It was an experience that I think I will be trying to chase for a long time.

Pros:
-Beautiful game, truly looks fantastic and the environments draw you in and adds to the immersion
-Fun, thrilling, interesting story that honestly felt more unique than I expected
-Gameplay does such a good job at creating suspense and tension, really does a good job keeping the horror of low ammo economy alive while also giving you some kickass moments
-Massive UX improvements from RE7, especially inventory-wise
-The games greatest strength though lies in its level design. Full stop. You have to experience it.

Cons:
-Press [P] to skip cutscene

Final Remark, this game (alongside RE7) reminded me of the long lost art of point and click adventure games. Something about the environments man, especially when you have one of those brief solitary moments where you feel safe and very alone for just a little while.

I dont know what their obsession is with this format in resident evil. But my problem with almost all the games is because they follow this dumb format. It seems that every game starts with a great setting with an interesting concept with tension and actual horror.

 The sequel is just as amazing as the prequel. But this time more interesting characters , 
 Better graphics , lighting and also improved texture quality on character models , buildings , surroundings. 

 The story is amazing. The game has many resemblances to the Og RE4 which was really good.
 RE8 has a big map and lots of areas to explore. Also different challenging enemies and fun boss fights.
 They succeeded in making the surroundings beautiful and also creepy depending on several areas.      
 Game also gives the horror vibes. Jumpscares are good and satisfying. Soundtracks are also pretty good.

As for a game advertising itself on being the best of RE4 and RE7, it underdelivers on both action and survival.
But, lets get to the beginning.
It begins with quite long walking-simulator section, which interesting on the first playthrough, kills any subsequent rounds just on how dragged and linear it is. There's literally no items to find and as for file hunting, yeah, AAA entertainment right there. After a ton of jumpscares over-relying on  1st person perspective, we're straight up thrown into the action, and all the worst flaws of the game are immediately made known. Fist - pacing. We fight 1 enemy, next door over 4 of them, next a whole horde, then - nothing, some 3 enemies right after, and a TON of walking with no combat for about an hour or two. The game doesn't know what it wants to be - a bunch of encounters thrown together and then LOOONG section with nothing happening at all. Pacing sucks horribly. And when it comes to the fight there's so much BS... 2 types of grunt enemies - 1 fast and 1 slow, that have little to no variety amongst each other, which is as well, since you can't do anything to them besides trying to shoot in the head. Nothing besides blocking and pushing away, which doesn't even stun them! Now I get why people complained about RE2R combat. You can't even knife them when they're down! They're back up in 2 seconds! You still need need to politely wait for them to get up so you'll have a first row to the peak RE8 experience of busting a whole clip to their head and hope for a headshot, since aiming anywhere else is a waste of ammo thanks to horrible hitboxes. What were they thinking?! They're all left to chance (?). Body shots can be shrugged off or make enemies swirl arund like ballerinas. Such tactics, so satifaction. It's a pleasant surprise if you score a headshot or a down, because mostly they tank pistol to the face like nobody's business. 
And you just stand there reminiscing better times.
Times, when there was such a thing as level design, where encounters would be immediately distinguishable and memorable.
There's no level design here 80% of the time. The first horde and last and that's all, and that's stretching. Mostly it's just a plain, flat field, or a tunnel for a change. One instance of grass obscuring your view. You CAN barricade doors, but it neither a common occasion or particularly sound from a tactical standpoint. One differerence is with flying enemies, appearing 3 times, where overhead cover matters, and piss poor AI emerges in its full - awfull glory. No door breaking, window barging, ladder climbing, it only has the enemies simply walk (even run on harder difficulties) in the straight line at you. If their 2 braincells meet they manage to strife. They have two attacks if they're armed, otherwise they just bite. And for a mini boss there's a version that has helmet on that you have to blow up and grill with your guns a little longer. No worries though, usually you can just fall back behind a certain line and they obediently go back to their spawn spot. YEP. Even on the Village of Shadows you can reliably crouch and shank the slow zombies' ankles away. Truly, a worthy succesor of RE4! 
Granted, at the last section of the game a new type of enemies are introduced, which is a breath of fresh air. The trick with them is to bait an attack so they expose their weak spot, which is both a reliable and exciting tactics, but noting can save the overall picture by then.  
Bosses telegraph poorly if you're doing anything to them, so you question if their poorly telegraphed weak spots are weak spots at all. Only final boss is geuinely ingenious encounter.
There're optional bosses, but don't worry, they go back to their spawn if you run away, such obedient little pups they are! You can juke them like that, they don't regenerate health or anything!
Exploration is ok, I guess, a little bit of hoarding for bosses, which rewards smart conservation of resources, extremely nice, no way you're going to have to choose what to keep and what to get rid of since you're virtually never going to run out of inventory space because raw materials are unlimited and separate from your normal inventory bag. Crafting's ok, I guess.
There's one ""stealth"" section mixed with old school find and use item section. On first time it's intriguing, but once you realize how linear it is it becomes a chore and all pretense of horror are replaced by boredom.
And it's a shame, because the scenery they chose is quite unique. The snow fallen Eastern European village leading to a homey castle, a riverbank and industrial factory. You rarely ever see socrealism represented as an aesthetic in a video game, and contrasted with gothic castle, yum! It's AAA perfect setting for a horror story (trust me)! Attention to detail is great. However, RE3R curse rears its ugly head yet again, there's a plenty of beautiful barren locations! The drawn-out begining and unreasonably glorified ""horror"" sections are the best examples, the whole point is to input a few on-rails clicks, you're stripped of all your agency (you're literally mysteriously stipped of all your weapons because the game says so), and unable to engage in any optional interaction. The ""scary stalker"" appears in scripted moments and follows scripted paths. You drain the water from a lake and reveal a village underneath, you know what happens? Boss battle and adieu! You can't even enter the area you traversed on the rooftops before. It's insulting. 
Story is contrived, with a transparent red herring. ""I didn't tell you the truth to protect you. I knew you'd seek vengence""- when the protagonist has almost single-handedly destroyed the main antagonist's lair. This is literally Wesker's reveal in OG RE1. You know it would be bad, but you fool yourself into hoping for any improvement. No, scratch that. This is big budget, big news AAA game, they dropped the ball, indesputably. 
Such a shame.
The enviroment design and graphical fidelity is obviously the main, and with time it becomes clear - the only selling point. It's a tripple A a hounted house ride mixed with indie gameplay.
Such a shame because it doesn't bode well for RE4R - Capcom don't do gameplay anymore, they do graphics and marketing campaign. And RE4 was... A brilliant gameplay based on genius level design, reliable gunplay and overall well though out pacing. Everything sung together and it took people out of left field.
RER4 doesn't advertise any of those things.
Overall, if you're not into shooting zombies and love escape rooms instead - give it a try. For anyone who craves an engaging gameplay, avoid.

I originally played it on Series S back when it came out, but recently took advantage of the Halloween sale and picked it back up again on PC. This is one of the best horror games I’ve played and I’ll explain why (spoiler free.) 

Story: The story is top notch. Ethan Winters is probably my favorite Resident Evil protagonist. He’s just a normal guy. Not a John Wick esque, roundhouse kick giving, boulder punching BA. Just a normal dude trying to save his wife and daughter and doing whatever he can. I love it. 

The story takes many twists and turns, including a ton of jaw dropping moments and action set pieces. Without spoiling anything, the game is split up into different “zones” that encapsulate different horror themes and gameplay styles. There’s survival horror, psychological horror without the ability to fight, straight up epic action sequences, and much more. In my opinion, the game stayed fresh throughout and the story kept me engaged the entire time. 

The bosses are excellent. Voice acting is superb. Set piece design is A+. The roster of characters in the game is fantastic, most of them are very well written and memorable. 

The game is a mix of action and horror. The game is overall not the scariest game I’ve ever played, but it has one section… oh God… one section that is THE scariest thing I’ve ever played. I speedrun this game and EVERY time I get to this certain section I dread it. 

The finale left tears in my eyes and really resonated with me emotionally, especially as a new father myself. I was a huge fan of RE7 and RE8 and I loved the Ethan Winters storyline. He truly is the greatest dad ever. 

Gameplay: The combat is top notch. I will say, it is much easier on PC than console because of mouse and keyboard. Part of what made it scary on console is how difficult the aiming was on the game pad. If you have decent aim, the combat is much easier on PC. 

The game is loaded with puzzles and treasures that reward exploration and sharp wit. If you take your time and search every inch of the game, you won’t be lacking in money, supplies, and really cool weapons. 

The game is difficult, but exponentially more so if you just try to barrel your way through the game as fast as possible. 

Presentation/Graphics: I personally think this game is one of the most visually appealing games I’ve ever seen. Whether it’s a dank, dimly lit basement illuminated solely by flickering candles, a gorgeous castle hall, snowy forest, or a factory corridor lit by flashing red lights, the game is gorgeous and makes fantastic use of light. 

Textures are gorgeous. If you run the game on max settings with ray tracing, you’d be hard pressed to find a horror game with better looking textures and light effects thanks to the tremendous RE engine. 

Enemy designs are amazing. Every enemy looks unique and terrifying. Not only do they look terrifying, but their movement is very lifelike and immersive. Enemies don’t just sit still and wait for you to kill them. They sway  from side to side, attempting to dodge your bullets. The blood and gore effects are top notch. Exploding a werewolf’s head with a shotgun always feels nice. 

This game is really fun to speedrun. The whole Resident Evil franchise is consistently a good choice for speed runners because it rewards skillful play and you can really breeze through it if you commit the puzzles and fights to memory. 

Things you might not like: The game is very good, with the exception of a few stale segments that don’t hold up as well as the rest. (Fishing Village, I’m looking at you.) 

Some people might not like the B movie cheese, but those people have clearly never played a Resident Evil game before. 

As mentioned earlier, the game is meant to be played slowly. If you just want to barrel through a story, the game is probably not for you. 

Conclusion: Give this game a chance! It’s a wonderful addition to the series, and in my opinion it’s up there with RE4 in terms of quality. Hope you enjoy as much as I did!",1699467685,1699474555,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, the game expertly blends classic survival horror elements with modern gameplay mechanics, creating an experience that is both nostalgic and innovatively fresh. The game's setting, a desolate village overshadowed by a looming castle, is not only rich in atmosphere but also in mystery, compelling players to explore every dark corner and unravel the secrets within.

The narrative is another strong point, continuing the story of Ethan Winters from ""Resident Evil 7"" and expanding the lore of the series in surprising ways. The storytelling is personal and gripping, with twists that keep players engaged until the very end.

Visually, ""Resident Evil Village"" is a marvel, showcasing breathtaking graphics that bring its gothic horror setting to life. The attention to detail in the environment is impeccable, from the decrepit state of the village houses to the opulent decay of the castle, every location is a feast for the eyes and sets the perfect stage for horror.

Gameplay-wise, the game introduces new enemies and creatures that are both terrifying and intriguing, each with their own unique challenges and weaknesses to discover. The game also sees the return of the franchise's beloved inventory management, encouraging players to think critically about what resources they carry.

Moreover, the game innovates by incorporating a hunting and crafting system, allowing players to hunt animals in the village to create dishes that provide permanent upgrades to the character. This adds an additional layer of strategy to the game, rewarding exploration and resourcefulness.

The character of Lady Dimitrescu, in particular, has become an iconic figure in the gaming community, and her presence in the game adds a charismatic yet fearsome antagonist that players will love to encounter.

Finally, ""Resident Evil Village"" offers a high replay value with its additional content, including the return of the Mercenaries mode, which challenges players to achieve high scores in combat-heavy runs through various levels.

In conclusion, ""Resident Evil Village"" is a masterful blend of horror, action, and storytelling that is both respectful of its roots and ambitious in its new directions. It provides an immersive gaming experience that is sure to satisfy long-time fans of the series and newcomers alike with its atmospheric world, challenging gameplay, and compelling story.",1699461231,1699461231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend Resident Evil Village to any fan of the saga and to people that like action games with some tastes of horror.

I wanted to continue Ethan's story after playing RE7, and it did not dissapoint! I have seen the description of this as a mix of RE7 and RE4, and its a perfect blend.

The story is the weakest point, I would say. It was kind of a mess, and started quiet strong but it became really week by the end. Having Miranda as the final boss, when you saw almost nothig of her through the whole campaing, was kind of menaingless. But the action, scenery and backtrackign were pretty of cool.

They are way too linear. Every thing feels scripted and predetermined. The game expect you to do to most things in a step by step manor. Then there are annoying puzzles and a lot of pixel hunting. You might end up running back and forth for looking for some item you can't even see, etc.

Pretty much my same review for this one since I got both RE games as package promotion.

Isolée parce qu’ils ont été mis en sécurité par Chris Redfield, arrivé à la rescousse à la fin du 7. En sécurité de quoi ?  On ne sait pas trop, mais bon de toutes manières, Chris va débarquer au cours d’une soirée d’hiver et abattre froidement Mia d’environ trente balles dans la poitrine et faire kidnapper Rose et Ethan. Ce dernier se réveille suite à un accident de voiture à proximité du fameux « Village » (qui n’a pas de nom, nous voyons juste que la monnaie utilisée est le « Lei », wikipedia me dit Moldavie ou Roumanie) où il va rapidement se faire attaquer par des lycans (loups-zombis-garous) et par Hagrid (ou le père Noël à vous de voir), dans une scène d’introduction qui ressemble ENORMEMENT à celle de RE4. Il rencontre les derniers villageois en vie qui finissent massacrés et Ethan, est lui-même capturé par les 4 seigneurs du coin : Lady Dimitrescu, Donna Beneviento, Salvatore Moreau et Karl Heisenberg. Ces quatre seigneurs sont aux ordres de Mother Miranda qui, il se trouve, comme par hasard, ça alors, a récupéré Rose et laissé Ethan pour mort car c’est elle qui a fait attaquer apparemment le convoi (on notera au passage que le plan de Chris est de mettre à l’abri Ethan, Mia et Rose à côté du domaine de Miranda… Génie).[...]  
Ceci dit, ce qui vient gâcher un peu tout ça, c’est l’écriture de certains personnages… enfin, non, pas certains… Juste celui d’Ethan ! S’il n’a pas de visage, il est assez loquace, mais raconte rarement des choses intéressantes et se retrouve plus à réagir comme un spectateur Twitch plus que comme héros de l’aventure. [...] 
Concernant le système de jeu, on se retrouve devant celui du 7 avec quelques ajustements pour le rapprocher du 4 et du remake du 2 [...] Pour avoir fait le jeu en difficulté « hardcore », j’ai appliqué ma méthode habituelle des RE canoniques : je regarde ma vie, mes balles et j’utilise ce que j’ai de disponible en plus grande quantité pour passer, en esquivant les combats inutiles. Alors ça a fonctionné mais avec le très bon équilibrage du jeu, je me suis retrouvé dans une assez bonne attrition durant les premiers 80 % du jeu, mais c’est exactement ce que j’étais venu chercher ! [...] 
	De temps en temps, mais c’est assez inhérent à la série des RE, il y a des séquences où le système de jeu empiète les intérêts de la cohérence, ainsi les ennemis traînent toujours avec eux dans leurs poches des objets utiles (même s’il y a plus de corbeaux avec des grenades par exemple…), il n’est pas possible de fermer des portes, il n’y a pas de dégâts de chute, la viande n’est pas empoisonnée, un ruisseau n’est pas traversable à pied, il arrive aussi de se retrouver coincé devant un tas de petites babioles, ou une énigme (notamment les labyrinthes à bille) qui techniquement pourraient se résoudre juste en tendant le bras, sans compter les grillages qui nous empêchent de passer et résistent à tous les explosifs sur Terre, ou encore, des lustres à incendier en les poussant péniblement sur des flambeaux alors qu’il y a trente bougies dans la pièce etc. Le jeu est parfois engoncé dans son moteur et son gameplay, et il devrait y avoir un peu plus de développement devant certaines situations, pour les présenter de manière moins frustrantes. 
	Les énigmes sont à mi-chemin de tout cela, il n’y en a absolument aucune qui ne soit vraiment difficile, et il semble toujours bizarre d’avoir un environnement qui fonctionne avec des clefs improbables que l’on obtient de manières incongrues, mais ces énigmes ont le méritent d’exister et sont relativement réalistes et crédibles à dire vrai, dans la localisation des objets, la nature de ces objets et la manière dont ils sont utilisés, même s’il y a ce problème de la grosse pince coupante qui disparaît de l’inventaire au début du jeu et dont on aurait eu l’utilité une dizaine de fois sans doute, ou encore cette scène incroyablement stupide avec la voiture... Ceci-dit, cela reste regrettable que la série des RE semble avoir renoncé à laisser vraiment le temps de se creuser la tête, surtout que le rythme du jeu n’est pas tonitruant, mais il est calibré pour que quelqu’un qui y jouerait une heure par si par là y trouve son compte. Je reste étonné à chaque RE que la solution à la Silent Hill, celle de calibrer le niveau de difficulté des énigmes en début de partie, n’ait jamais été tentée pour les RE. Le symptôme de ce refus de laisser réfléchir les joueurs se retrouve dans les myriades de marques jaunes et d’items scintillants qui indiquent les directions à suivre ou quelques objets à récupérer. [...] 

	Concernant le moteur graphique, le RE Engine, RE8 est sorti au démarrage de la diffusion du Ray Tracing, mais à la fin de l’aire PS4/XOne, et au démarrage de la génération suivante. Le jeu a désormais trois ans et avec les graphismes poussés à bloc, il reste vraiment impressionnant [...] À ce très bon moteur graphique s’ajoute un excellent travail sur les sons [...] Dans les maisons abandonnées, le vent qui siffle, le plancher et le toit qui grincent etc. viennent ponctuer la partition des bruits de pas, des borborygmes et cris des monstres qui sont affreux, hurlants et stressants. Les musiques sont globalement discrètes mais pesantes et tournent vraiment sur un rythme angoissant, elles sont capables de précipiter nos actions assez aisément, même s’il n’y a pas de thème principal qui s’en dégage. 

	Les ambiances sont posées efficacement et sans aller jusque dans le registre de la peur, il y a une angoisse régulière qui vient empêcher d’être serein au moment de la découverte d’un nouvel environnement. Sombre, sale, très emprunt de l’imagerie de la fin du XIXème siècle – les petits villages paysans des tableaux polonais, les palais des anciens seigneurs qui perdent leurs privilèges peu à peu, les constructions en briques, les sidérurgies massives chaudes et étouffantes, un peu de steampunk par là, le loup-garou et l’ambiance gothique générale, des monstres types abomination du Dr Frankenstein – RE8 brille clairement car il est à la fois bourré de références à des opus précédents de la série, mais parce que son ambiance est unique aussi. [...] Dans la zone du Village notamment, il n’est pas inconcevable que des gens vivaient ici : la nourriture est stockée, il y a un lit, un poêle de chauffage en fonte sur lequel faire à manger, des décorations uniques à chaque bâtisse, faite parfois en brique, parfois dans des matériaux traditionnels, les toilettes sont dehors et les gens vivaient avec les deux-trois animaux qu’ils élevaient pour le lait ou les œufs. 
	Ce RE offre une belle transposition de la même critique de la modernité que l’on a dans les anciens épisodes (après-tout, le premier RE paraît au moment où les études sur les gènes, les virus et les scandales alimentaires -vache folle- se font parfois échos dans les débats publics). Le fait d’y ajouter un filtre de lecture spirituel continue de filer la longue métaphore dans laquelle s’est lancée la saga, et ce, de manière intéressante puisque n’appelant pas de réponses franches aux questions que se posent les joueuses et joueurs, RE8 laisse une part d’interprétation et donc, de doutes, et par conséquent, d’angoisse puisque les limites de l’envisageable s’élargissent. Par ailleurs, le fait de se situer dans un environnement archaïque mais assez générique pour être familier des occidentaux implique tout de même efficacement, autant qu’il va sans doute intriguer celles et ceux complètement étrangers à ce type d’endroit et qui seront sensibles à l’imaginaire que peuvent invoquer un village ancien à côté d’un château en ruine, ou d’un vieux moulin qui tourne à présent à vide.

Its a damn shame, because it looks like such an amazing game too, i enjoyed RE7 and was hoping for more of the same here, but its badly optimized, its just not happy on my system at all.

Negative recommendation because of optimization. ill be back to try again in the near future. 

Just another excuse for me to get a Nvidia 4090 in a new system.

EDIT: Bought a new PC with a 4090, runs like a dream i am now enjoying it.

All parts are ok, but nothing can beat RE,2,3,4. The village reminds me a bit of RE4, which is fine by me. 
The unreality of the main character (what injuries he goes through and continues with determination) is acceptable lol. Good graphics, atmosphere and the story. I believe that anyone who has been in the RE world since the beginning will definitely play and enjoy it to some extent. I think that I will enjoy the game until the end (I'm just a modest gamer, more into the story and atmosphere of the game than actual gameplay) but I doubt that I will repeat it for the achievement or whatever, unlike RE,2,3,4 which I can always repeat from time to time. All in all, I recommend it, especially to gamers who have been in the RE world forever.

Gameplay in Resident Evil Village is a perfect blend of classic survival horror and modern action elements. The combat is both satisfying and challenging, with an array of weapons at your disposal, but scarce resources that keep you on edge. The story itself is engaging and takes some surprising twists and turns, blending elements of folklore and the supernatural seamlessly with the traditional Resident Evil universe. The game's pacing is excellent, offering moments of tense exploration, terrifying encounters, and poignant storytelling, all in perfect balance.

The audio design in the game is exceptional, from the unsettling sounds of creaking doors to the haunting melodies accompanying the action. The voice acting is top-notch, adding depth to the characters, making them more relatable and convincing. Resident Evil Village's use of RE Engine, Capcom's proprietary technology, allows for smooth character animations, realistic physics, and stunning particle effects. The game also features remarkably detailed textures and environmental effects that contribute to the overall sense of immersion. Whether you're exploring the dimly lit interiors of a foreboding castle or navigating the foggy marshes, the graphics consistently impress.

In my humble opinion, Resident Evil Village is the apex of the franchise. It successfully blends the series' signature elements with fresh innovations, providing a terrifying and immersive journey that keeps players on the edge of their seats. Whether you're a long-time fan or a newcomer, Resident Evil Village stands as the finest Resident Evil title, offering a captivating and unforgettable gaming experience.",1698941638,1698941805,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

Highly recommended. Extra thumbs up that the campaign can be done in around 12 hours. Mercenaries is fun but not quite the heights of RE4 or RE5, but worthwhile for unlocking bonus content for campaign.

RE8 ditches the low stakes setting of a single household, in favour of a more fairy tale-esque setting set in a village.
The village itself feels very similar to RE4, albeit less malicious and more tragic, with everyone looking towards a godly figure known as Mother Miranda [spoiler],basically just this games equivalent of Saddler,[/spoiler] for help.
And looming over this village however are a variety of main locations, such as a flooded watermill, the imposing Castle Dimitrescu, a messed up doll house, and a bit more beyond that.

You've got werewolves, vampires, standards zombies and more, and these are by far some of the most aggressive [spoiler]and tankiest[/spoiler] enemies in the franchise.
You've also got the return of the merchant system from RE4, meaning currency makes a return, along with weapon upgrades and the ability to sell excess supplies and valuables.
Despite the different coat of paint, it's definitely closer in tone to RE4, but where it differs is in the action.
While RE4 throws a lot of enemies at you, RE8 handles its survival aspects better in my opinion by throwing harder enemies at you. These guys are aggressive, they're faster than most RE enemies and they can take quite the beating on average.
Until you get comfortable towards the later half of the game, you may find yourself a bit low on ammo unless you're willing to part with a bit of coin. I genuinely liked this as it made running from battles feel more viable, or if I'm going to fight, I need to make every bullet count.

[h1]Continuing with the positivity, the level design is quite strong, some of my favourite in the series[/h1]

While the game could be divided into chapters, the game keeps funnelling you from major locations back towards the village, with more locations being unlocked each time you come back.
The rest of the game also has this winding level design mentality, what with having plot progression tie into backtracking, but the Village is in the title for this game, and I feel its thematics and level design are enough to justify that. 

[h1]Sadly while I quite like the setting itself, the actual plot/hook is nowhere near as strong as the games I'm comparing it to[/h1]

The games main way of hooking you from the start is shock value, I won't go into massive spoilers here but I will say that the game plays its hand way too early, for the vast majority of the game it feels like what I'm going up against is easier than the last thing when it comes to scale and sheer threat.

Comparing it to the Baker residence from RE7, the persistent threats are nowhere near as menacing, nor do they have any surprises to catch you off guard.
Lastly, the boss fights against the bigger bads here are often pretty annoying, they're usually quite tanky, their mechanics are lame and I felt only one of these had appropriate mechanics to match its absurdity and scale.

I just feel it's a step down considering how well built up the Bakers in RE7 were compared to these guys, a little bit sad but not a deal breaker.

[h1]There's one last thing to mention, and that would be the DLC[/h1]

Aside from the expansion, this DLC also brings in the option of a 3rd person camera, something that I feel should've been included for free, but regardless, is a fair selling point for enough for some people to warrant a mention.

Next is the expansion, the epilogue for the game.
Because of it's place in the plot, I can't go into detail about the plot, but I will say that I found it highly unnecessary, [spoiler]even if it did have some sweet moments,[/spoiler] and concerning for the plot moving forward since in theory, we'll know about the timeline of some characters for a long time to come.
But in gameplay, it's a lot of weak weaponry, reused assets, forced walking and bland hallways.
None of what makes the main game shine is present here, and it makes it feel pretty boring, even if the experience is only 2 - 4 hours long.

[h1]Despite some issues, I still feel this is one of the better games in the series[/h1]
I have no idea what will come after this game, as it feels like RE as a series typically tries to reinvent itself every 2 - 3 games, but these latest entries in the franchise have felt like some of the best they've had to offer, very high quality.

Definitely an easy recommendation to make, just so long as you're not looking for the same tense experience that RE7 provided.",1698530263,1698530263,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are a bunch of bizarre moments where you are sort of thrown into a dying loop because the game does not do any semblance of a reasonable job giving the player an expectation to follow. The guns are laughable even by Resident Evil standards. The story goes with a ""we won't tell you anything until the very end when we'll slap you in the face with everything via exposition in writing"" approach to story telling which... kind of works?

Resident Evil Village is like that one bizarre party where you end up laughing hysterically and crying in a closet at the same time. It's a rollercoaster of horror and hilarity, with a dash of existential crisis thrown in for good measure.

First, let's talk about the hero of the game: Ethan Winters. This guy is the master of deadpan humor, facing the creepiest horrors with the enthusiasm of a Monday morning meeting. He's less ""Action Hero Extraordinaire"" and more ""Why did I even come to this village?"" But, oh, the absurdity! From stapling his hands back on to nonchalantly carrying liters of health-restoring soup, Ethan's sheer ridiculousness makes you snicker even in the face of grotesque monstrosities.

Now, the village itself. It's like someone thought, ""Let's put vampires, werewolves, and a giant metal chicken lady in the same place!"" It's as if they spun a wheel of mythical creatures and just threw it all in. You'll find yourself questioning the game's sanity as you dodge Lady Dimitrescu's attempts at a close embrace and fend off her freakishly tall daughters.

And don't get me started on the Duke, the jolly traveling merchant who somehow manages to be a comic relief buffet in this carnival of horrors. He's got the magical ability to turn everything you find into cash, like a hoarder's dream come true. He's the friendly neighborhood capitalist, reminding you that even during a zombie apocalypse, someone's gotta make a profit.

But for all the hilarity, there's an underlying sense of dread. As you uncover the mysteries of the village, you'll realize that beneath the absurdity lies a tale of despair and loss. It's like trying to laugh through a terrifying therapy session that's slowly unearthing your deepest fears.

In conclusion, Resident Evil Village is a game that's so funny, it's depressing. It's a wild, sometimes absurd, often terrifying ride through a village that redefines the meaning of ""wacky horror."" So, grab your stapler, load up on soup, and get ready to laugh and cringe your way through this horror-comedy extravaganza.

I get 100-120 fps, but while shooting in some places it's 80 fps. There is a place in the castle with Dimitrescu's second daughter where 50 fps. And if you initially have 60-80 fps, then in some places, during shooting where fps is very important, you will have 30-40 fps, as happens in RE4 remake. RE4 remake requires 50 fps more than God of war pc 2022 and Marvel's Spider-man pc 2022 and Village 2021, and the graphics are no better, in some places even worse.

The hardcore mode is dumb in places in RE: Village and overpriced, it feels random because you do what you need to do, but you still lose. But sometimes you pass right away, very rarely, although you do the same thing.. For example, at the beginning where you have to hold out for some time or in the final battle with Miranda.

The character cannot hit, push, if he is pinned, he cannot dodge. And even in RE 4, he can only do this when the game shows a QTE and even this does not always work despite the fact that the player presses at the right time when the QTE is still on the screen. 

I really don't like the ""labyrinths"" in Resident Evil, such as the Heisenberg Factory.

Otherwise, I liked the game, very beautiful graphics, HDR, plot, the game surprises the player with original ideas or well rethought and remade in the Resident Evil style with interesting characters. I really liked the story of Rose in the DLC and the return of Eveline, whom we saw very rarely in the 7th part.
I’m waiting for the 9th part and the rest of the remakes and hope for good optimization and that the developers will don’t make a demanding game because the view of the game doesn’t change much, and the fps requires 50-60 more and drops even lower, as I explained above.",1697282289,1697282289,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil Village is a mixed bag of horror elements that caters to a wide range of tastes, but this concoction, while intriguing initially, becomes overwhelming and unbalanced as you delve deeper. Just like sipping a complex smoothie, the first few sips are delightful, dark, and brooding, but as you continue, it turns fiery and wild, leaving you with a confusing aftertaste.

In this game, you once again step into the shoes of Ethan Winters, the same resilient yet bewildered protagonist from Resident Evil 7. This time, he's found himself in a chilling, snow-covered village teeming with lycanthropes instead of kids playing. The game manages to blend action and fear effectively during its first half. It starts with a hair-raising introduction that leads you through a village that's as monstrous as its furry inhabitants. Silence dominates the atmosphere, and every creak or snap of a twig sends shivers down your spine. Resources are scarce, firepower is limited, and fights are genuinely perilous. It's an unsettling crime scene that defies understanding, but you know you'll return to uncover the truth. Resident Evil Village shines when it embraces this patient, eerie atmosphere.

One of the early locations you explore is Dimitrescu's Castle, a grand fortress inhabited by a formidable lady, her diabolical daughters, and classic Resident Evil puzzles. More importantly, the castle preserves the village's eerie ambiance. The pacing is superb as you navigate its enigmatic puzzles and hidden passages, all while trying to ignore the suffocating silence.

But not everything in this game is flawless. Some moments prioritize action over fear, with boss fights feeling choreographed rather than genuine tests of survival. This pattern continues through most of the game, where significant encounters feel more like rehearsals with strict cues to follow. However, one location stands out as an exception.

As you progress, Resident Evil Village takes a turn. The village transforms into a hub world with four different zones, each home to one of the game's villains. The area you visit right after escaping the castle is especially exceptional, but I can't reveal any details about it without spoilers. Suffice it to say, it's a nightmarish and inventive experience that will keep you on your toes. It's a moment of vulnerability in the game, and it's masterful in how it plays with your fears.

Each return to the hub world keeps things fresh. The village subtly evolves to reflect your absence, with weather changes and subtle alterations that make revisiting areas feel rewarding. You may find new tools, like keys, during your adventures, making it satisfying to unlock previously inaccessible spots. These moments of discovery, such as finding new weapons or mysterious treasures, add depth to the gameplay.

Resident Evil Village is visually stunning, with detailed environments and intricate objects that bring its world to life. While the game ran smoothly on my RTX 2070-equipped system, I experienced one crash during a cutscene. This occurred during an early review build, so it may not reflect the final product.

The change in tone during the latter half of the game is kind of jarring. Action increasingly supersedes the horror aspect, and the abundance of weapons feels out of place. The introduction of the Duke, a shopkeeper who offers supplies and gun upgrades, makes resource scarcity less meaningful. By the end, the game prioritizes shooting over suspense and unpredictability.

As Resident Evil Village nears its conclusion, it spirals into chaos, with sequences that feel more suited to Call of Duty than a survival horror game. The transition from a chilling, unknown world to action-packed shootouts is unsettling, and the fear of running out of ammo replaces the fear of the unknown. The game sacrifices its unpredictable, chilling atmosphere for more straightforward gunfights.

Despite this shift, the game's story remains engaging. Ethan Winters' predicament hooks you from the beginning, and the conclusion, while messy, ties up loose ends and leaves room for more questions, a challenging feat for a long-running series.

In the end, Resident Evil Village tries to cater to a broad audience, but this ambition comes at the cost of balance. The early horror-focused sections are exceptional, but the game loses its way as it approaches the end, favoring action over fear. Despite this, it remains compelling.

Overall it's a wonderful game and it's a nice change of pace. The serialization and cinimatic focus of recent Resident Evil titles is something I'm enjoying and I'm hoping to see where Ethan's daughter plays in the next game.",1697192342,1697192342,True,50,1,0.779835224151611328,0,True,False,False

While it might not deliver the same bone-chilling scares as its predecessor, Resident Evil 7, it compensates with a more action-packed experience that masterfully maintains the series' signature atmosphere.

As a long-time fan of the Resident Evil franchise, I stepped into Village with high expectations, and I wasn't disappointed. Right from the start, the game immerses you in a beautifully realized, eerie village and its surrounding environments. The attention to detail in the graphics, sound design, and environmental storytelling is impeccable. Every creaking floorboard and distant whisper adds to the pervasive sense of dread.

What sets Resident Evil Village apart from its predecessors is its shift towards a more action-oriented gameplay style. While it may not be as terrifying as Resident Evil 7, it delivers in terms of heart-pounding action sequences, intense boss battles, and an arsenal of weapons that makes you feel like a one-person army against the horrors that await. This evolution in gameplay adds an exciting twist to the series while retaining its core essence.

The storyline is engaging, filled with intriguing mysteries, and memorable characters. Ethan Winters, our protagonist from Resident Evil 7, returns to face a new nightmare as he searches for his kidnapped daughter. The introduction of new characters like Lady Dimitrescu and her daughters adds depth to the narrative, making you question the motives of every character you encounter.

The game's pacing is impeccable, offering moments of respite amid the chaos to explore and solve puzzles. The merchant, Duke, provides a welcome dose of humor and acts as your one-stop shop for weapons and upgrades. Managing your resources and making strategic decisions about which weapons to buy and upgrade adds a layer of depth to the gameplay.

While Resident Evil Village may not reach the same levels of horror as its predecessor, it excels in creating a tense and eerie atmosphere that keeps you on edge throughout. It's a roller coaster ride of adrenaline-pumping action, unexpected twists, and unforgettable moments that will keep fans of the horror genre and the Resident Evil series thoroughly entertained.

In conclusion, Resident Evil Village may take a different route in terms of horror, but it doesn't sacrifice the franchise's identity. It's a thrilling, action-packed adventure that continues to build upon the rich lore of the series. If you're a fan of Resident Evil or enjoy a mix of horror and action, don't miss out on this unforgettable journey through the village of nightmares.

The first two areas had a really great horror atmosphere, after that it goes a bit downhill in my opinion. However it was still fun to play.

[b]First off: Denuvo.[/b]
It's gone, No more need to bitch about it anymore.
But I don't understand why they'd wait 2 fucking years just to remove the fucking DRM.
A DRM, mind you, that is capable of being easily cracked in just measly hours or so.

[b]Second on the list, The length.[/b]
6 hours may be an average length for a first time playthrough, but once you compared this to other Resident Evil games, That length is SHORT in comparison.

Compare this to my times with games such as RE4R (8-10 hours max), RE7 (7-8 hours max), or RE5 (10-12 hours max), It's abysmally short, and this really doesn't paint a good picture for a game that costs around $50+ AUD or even at launch when it came out with a ridiculous $90 AUD price tag.

[b]Third, The content.[/b]
Main campaign and Mercenaries. That's it.
The post-game content for this game is minimal and pales in comparison to RE7's content, even without DLC.

The Extra Content shop doesn't even have anything good either, and at worst: The guns you can buy from the Duke can EASILY OUTPERFORM any gun the Extra Content shop offers you.

Case in point, The Handcannon PZ. One of Village's ONLY returning guns after being missing from Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil 6. Maxed out, it can deal around 3200 damage to enemies and even have one of the best reload speeds in the entire game...

...That is, until you buy and fully upgrade the S.T.A.K.E Magnum.

All of a sudden, the Handcannon easily became redundant as the S.T.A.K.E has 4500 damage, almost nearly close to the Handcannon's damage in Resident Evil 5 (that being 5000 when maxed out) and on top of that, also bearing a MUCH higher ammo capacity, fire rate, and even reload speed. (28 rounds compared to Handcannon's 5 rounds.)

Somehow, they nerfed one of Resident Evil's best post-game unlockables for a weapon you can just buy from the shop without even finishing the game. Why.

[b]Fourth, the story.[/b] (Spoilers here)
Out of the many times I went and ran through the game's story to speedrun, I swear even skipping the cutscenes alone accounts for the fact how fucking long Lady D's portion is, only *a cut* above Heisenberg's section. And yet the ""Big Bad"" [spoiler] Miranda [/spoiler] doesn't even show up until you finish off Chris's assault on the village, and that's the last 5% portion of the game.

Besides that, The story isn't even remotely good. 

You play as Ethan (who is now a dad), and you have to save your infant daughter against a group of cult maniacs in a enclosed European town.

(I wonder where they got this from... [spoiler] RE4 and Silent Hill 1 [/spoiler])

Once you enter said town, You find a group of survivors and spoiler alert: [spoiler] They die, big whoop. But one of those survivors, Elena, could EASILY become an important character if Capcom tried. But they didn't. She died and Ethan didn't do shit to save her. [/spoiler]

After that, You meet up with Dimitrescu, [spoiler] kill her three daughters, then she turns into a furious dragon. Fast forward, You find a jar with your infant daughter's limbs, and then you go on a wild goose chase to find them all. [/spoiler]

Beneviento was probably the most interesting section of the game, But it wears out quickly on your second run through of the game. [spoiler] One scary baby section of the game, and she's dead. Great. [/spoiler]

Moreau is boring, plain and simple.
Somehow even taking away a boat still can't make the fish fight any less boring than it needed to be.

Heisenberg is the first and only good character you'd meet in the story.
His dungeon is long, and for a good reason.

But I swear, they did him dirty for not giving him an alternate scenario which I'll drop now.

[spoiler] So when you meet Heisenberg again in the dungeon, You (supposedly) have a choice to join him and kill Miranda. which Ethan automatically declines. [/spoiler]
It's a stupid thing that I am disappointed for. If you could choose Mia and [spoiler] Zoe [/spoiler] in RE7, Then surely they could've done it again for Village. But since this is Capcom, who is notorious for reusing assets in games. Why am I even surprised.

Anyway, [spoiler] you kill Heisenberg, and THEN, Miranda shows up again. Only to kill Ethan in 3 minutes. What a record. [/spoiler]

It was then revealed that [spoiler] Ethan had died since RE7 and has mold regeneration inside of him. [/spoiler] And I'll give the game credit, they did a good job explaining how Ethan can even reattach his limbs. Good job.

[spoiler] You kill Miranda, save Rose, and then end the game with a sacrifice of Ethan Winters. [/spoiler]
(This choice alone will be a mistake for what comes next.)
 
So they made an story that's actually average, That's my one of only good points I'll give to this game. Moving on...

[b]Fifth, DLC Content.[/b]
1 campaign and a third person mode that is literally a mod you can download off from Nexus Mods, and extra Mercenaries characters.

I'm not going into detail about the campaign or the third person, because I am saving that for the DLC review when I get to that. What I will go into detail, however, is comparing the DLC to what RE7's DLC offers.

Resident Evil 7 Gold Edition offers:

-Resident Evil 7: Base Game
-Resident Evil 7: Season Pass (which itself offers:)
   -Not A Hero (Campaign)
   -End of Zoe (Campaign)
   -Nightmare (Minigame)
   -Bedroom (Minigame)
   -21 (Minigame)
   -Daughters (Minigame)

All for the low, low price of $56.89 AUD. The same price you can get if you were to buy Village.
All I'm saying now, is that if you can buy Village, you can buy RE7: Gold Editon, which has FAR more content than what Village can offer for the same price.

[b]Sixth, and finally, the Achievements.[/b] (and my problem with Mapmatician)
Effortless, That's what I'm going to say.

You got your usual Frugalist and Speedrun for X hours achievement, even bringing back an achievement where you knock an arrow with your knife from RE5.

But even on the Hardest difficulty: Village of Shadows. It's either a mix of the most effortless and easy parts, to the most ridiculous and bullshit parts in the entire game, and the reward you get for it is what should've been a fucking confetti gun.

The Rocket Pistol is absolutely worthless, can't even kill on the easiest difficulty with it's low damage (500) and low fire rate. It's almost like a sick fucking joke.

In the meanwhile, the Mapmatician achievement can go FUCK ITSELF.
What should've been an easy achievement, became 3 hours of pure agony trying to find any missing items in a room, only to softlock myself and end up restarting an hour's worth of progress due to my own paranoia. 

Noticed how I said ""should've""? Because the MAP ITSELF, is HINDERING YOU.

That's right, The map got fucking gutted right after how useful it was for Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3's remakes. It used to show you where you missed ammo and even key items you missed. Only for it to never do that in Village for no fucking reason.

I can understand this for RE7 because that came out before the REmakes.
That, is not an excuse for Village. 

The only reason it's even possible to get the achievement was to repeatedly check the Challenges menu and see how much progress you have gained for said achievement.
But it should've been an easy QoL change to add it on the fucking map itself.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
I can easily say this is literally the third worst Resident Evil game I've ever played, behind Resident Evil 0 and Resident Evil 6. My disappointment with this game is unfathomable.

If you really want to buy this game. Please, please get this on a discount. It is not worth the full price by a long shot.

If you like this game, More power to you.
But I am showing how disappointed and furious I am with this godforsaken game.
And that is why I do not recommend this game.",1681259079,1696761682,False,1,1,0.356725156307220459,0,True,False,False

The game is actually good and enjoyable, but it is no survival horror. I'd say more survival action. Capcom finally nailed it with RE7, they brought back all the horror and anxiety from real RE classics, while adavncing and innovating the survival horror genre. It was a miracle but they already decided to squander it all to appeal the masses. So forget all about the tension, claustrophoby and helplessness that made RE7 great. In RE Village, they wanted to strike a balance between horror and action, and they obviously failed although not entirely. Capcom thought RE7 was good (in terms of sales) but they wanted the next RE to sell even more, so they tried the obvious: they imitated their most (wrongly) acclaimed title in the series, RE4. RE4 was an ok game, but it was also where the series started to rush into the abyss of forgettable crap.

Anyway, given the premises, they did an amazing job. Young and old fans will probably enjoy this RE, even if it is far from the genius of the 7. Enjoyable is a fit adjective for this game, entertaining is too. It isn't survival horror though. In a real survivor horror you need to explore cautiously and make hard strategic decisions and keep your cool else you fuck up. Here you are just required to have fast reflexes and act fast. Assuming you play on hardcore, else it's no challenge at all. ""Survival action fps with a bad aiming mechanic"" is more adequate for RE8. Yeah you cannot aim down sight like in RE7 Not a Hero for some reason, you always fire from the hip and the aiming just restricts the aiming reticle. Movement and interaction is also downgrade from RE7, doors will open automatically for you far before colliding with them, and you no longer have the hand forward animation whenever you move against a wall. It's all small things but they do break immersion and it was lazy to take them out.

The story is pretty good and interesting, way better than RE standards but also kinda shallow in its execution, probably because they cut much during development. It feels like a collection of very different ideas stitched together to give you an ever changing atmosphere throughout the game. It works somehow though, and they pulled off both the spooky openness of the environment and the less linear way to progress. The weapon/merchant/upgrade system is also fun and adds entertainment. There are a few very nice puzzles, but never too hard and most puzzles are absolute no brainers. Difficulty is toned down to meet the needs of the casual gamer, so I suggest hardcore diificulty for veterans of the series, which equals normal difficulty in RE1, RE2, RE3, RE7. Even the most basic enemies are bullet sponges, but you'll be given a replenished arsenal so you won't worry too much about that after a while. The hardest section of the game is at the very beginning, so after that you're golden till the end.
The RE engine is amazing as ever, with a 1080ti I had almost everything maxed out and still a stable 140fps. Visuals are great and for the most part even improved, except a few things like the explosive red barrels which look cartoonish (RE4 style).

Now i will buy the Winters' Expansion DLC cause i want to see what happends next. The graphics are too good for this world, it's looking better than real life and if you play it on a 4k TV with high refresh rate this game becomes a MONSTER! 
Just sit on the bed with a controller in one hand and relax with a gameplay of killing monsters. 

The coolest thing about this game is that it is in my country, Romania. I love how Mrs. Dimitrescu looks like, she's a vampire, a refference about Romania and the vampires that are located at the Bran Castle in Brasov.

I cant wait for Resident Evil 9 to appear! Maybe a VR remastered of Village. I saw some mods but they are broken and get you dizzy in cutscenes, maybe a VR DLC will be good!

Pros:
+ Fantastic graphics and optimization, the game runs with pretty much everything set to ultra with no dips or stuttering, hats off!
+ Ethan is now a fully fleshed character.
+ Voice acting (at least in English) is REALLY good, but I do wished there was British accents thrown in since the game is, in y'know, Romania.
+ They learned from RE7 and now we have decent enemy variety, nothing to write home about but they heard.
+ Awesome level design and atmosphere.
+ The Merchant returns! (well, it's not HIM, but hey!).

Cons:
- Combat is clunky as all hell, I think is even clunkier than in RE7!
- Weapons don't feel good and lack the proper accuracy to make them feel like you're shooting something.
- The whole vampire dommy mommy was a fiasco, she showed up for like 2-3 hours and that's it. Which brings me to...
- Boss fights in RE7 were lackluster (except for Jack's) but here... man, what happened? They're lame af. Villains in this game had plenty of potential to become one of, if not, the best cast in the series, but we ended up with lame and short fights.
- Puzzles are WAAY too easy.
- The whole House Beneviento DOESN'T BELONG to the game, or any RE for that matter. If I wanted to play smth like that I'd play SH/PT. 
- Ending was meh (still better than RE7's).

Overall, I feel like they tried so SO hard to emulate RE4 perfectly-balanced formula they ended up with a game that is, in the end, dissapointing, as it doesn't know what it wants to REALLY be. Sometimes, it wants to be SH, sometimes RE4, and then, sometimes, its own thing. Game lacks the direction needed in order to be a good RE in my eyes.
Even if I love RE4 and I consider it one of the best games ever, its formula shouldn't be replicated, but rather, inspiring.

Final score: 5.5/10, first time since RE6 I didn't enjoy a RE title.",1695914588,1695914588,False,15,0,0.62292402982711792,0,True,False,False

I'm giving it a positive review, but overall I'd say I'm on the line. This game recycles a lot of concepts and design from earlier RE games. The crafting and upgrading systems are a blend of RE4 and RE7, but simpler and just not as well done as those games. There are so many similar guns it feels like lazy design. There is a Mr. X monster from RE2. They block off going back to areas for exploration after that area's story is done, so you can't go back to finish clearing those rooms and find treasures you missed (why???!)

On the positive side there are some good boss fights (not all of them) and some thematically interesting areas that I really enjoyed.

Also, the game is way overpriced. I say half of that would have been right, like they did for RE7 (which was a vastly superior and innovative game).",1620766259,1695902805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The meticulous attention to detail is amazing. We can say that they did it with love and a desire for perfectionism. Correctly chosen intonations and voices, musical accompaniment add integrity to the picture.

[b]Village[/b] is more of a movie with gameplay elements than the other way around. The passage was on ""Normal"" difficulty. This is probably the first Resident where it is approved to fight back against monsters, arming the GG almost from the very beginning with a shotgun and a large number of pistol cartridges. Moreover, monsters give different loot (lei, reagents, crystal skulls, herbs). This encourages you to move around locations more confidently. Whether this is good or bad is difficult to give a definite answer. Players complained that the seventh part was too scary, which is why such changes.

Each antagonist is thought out in its own way. They are memorable. The difficulty of the battle with the bosses gradually increases, although at first it seems that there will be no need to sweat. If you read the diaries carefully, you can learn a lot about their personalities.

But what about the absurdities in The Resident? This is a series where you shouldn’t look for logic in the script. And it’s also not worth judging the game by the actions of the characters. Long labyrinthine corridors, riddles, a frightening atmosphere, ornate monsters - this is the Resident. Even despite the wildness of some decisions, in the end they still try to explain everything that is happening.

There were unpleasant FPS drops that appeared out of the blue under certain conditions (a huge number of flies and a transition from a closed place to an open one, copious amounts of vomit). Otherwise, thanks for 120 fps indoors and 90-100 outdoors. The game does not require such high numbers, but the optimization of everything is magical (except for the cases described above).

🎮 Main Game Review

Hey, gamers! Buckle up, because we're diving into the twisted, terrifying, and sometimes hilarious world of Resident Evil Village. First off, let's talk about our boy Ethan Winters. The guy's as bland as a rice cake, but hey, that just makes the village's wacky residents shine even more, am I right?

👻 The Good Stuff
1. Variety is the Spice of Death: One minute you're in a haunted castle, the next you're in a factory that even Elon Musk would find creepy. The game keeps you on your toes like a cat on a hot tin roof.
2. Action-Packed: If you're the kind of person who likes to shoot first and ask questions later, you're in for a treat. This game has more action than a Michael Bay movie, minus the explosions.
3. Audio Bliss: The sound design is so good, you'll think the zombies are right behind you. Spoiler: they probably are.

🤡 The Not-So-Good
1. Where's the Horror?: For a game that's supposed to make you wet your pants, it's surprisingly light on the scares. It's like going to a haunted house and finding out it's run by clowns.
2. Boss Fights: More like ""Boss Frights,"" because they're not that scary. Kinda feels like the developers ran out of coffee during this part.

🎮 DLC: Shadows of Rose Review

Alright, let's switch gears and talk about the DLC, Shadows of Rose. You know, the one where Rose tries to live a normal life but ends up freezing zombies and destroying goo. Sounds like my last relationship, to be honest.

🌹 The Good Stuff
1. New Mechanics: Freezing enemies? Destroying goo? Sign me up! It's like they took the base game and sprinkled some magic dust on it.
2. Intensity Level 100: This DLC has some of the most intense moments in the Resident Evil series. You'll be gripping your controller so hard, it might just snap.

🤔 The Not-So-Good
1. Short and Not-So-Sweet: With a runtime of just 2.5 hours, this DLC is shorter than my attention span. 
2. Déjà Vu: No new areas? Really? It's like going back to your hometown and realizing nothing's changed. A bit of a letdown, if you ask me.

Final Thoughts
So, should you play Resident Evil Village and its DLC? Absolutely, especially if you're a fan of the series or just love a good action-horror game. Just don't expect to be sleeping with the lights off anytime soon.

And that's a wrap! Whether you're here for the scares, the action, or just to see Ethan get his butt kicked, Resident Evil Village and its DLC have something for everyone. Just maybe keep a change of pants handy, you know, just in case. 😜",1621002027,1695741520,True,0,0,0.314142525196075439,0,True,False,False

This game is just a bag full of mixed feelings and failed attempts:
- Ethan is an annoying brat. The ""every guy"" trope worked in Re7 because it enhanced the horror aspect. In Village they tried to force a more ""re-like"" quirky personality but it just doesn't work the way other protags in the series do (Leon, Chris, Jill, Claire...).
- The game focuses more on combat than horror. That by itself is not a bad thing. Re4 and Re4Remake are one of my favorite Re-games and games in general because the combat focus works so well. Every single aspect in those games' design works together. Village just feels clunky and so does Re7 but Re7 isn't trying to be an action game. Village tries and fails.
- The writing is mid at best and ""Ethan no"" at worst. This is the most plot hole filled Re-game since Re6.
- Takes way too many ideas from Re4. Almost a ripoff.
+ One of the best horror sequences ever in house Beneviento. Just makes me wish the whole game was as good.
+ The game looks gorgeous and the motion capture and voice acting is great.

PROS:
-The setting of the game is very creepy
-The intro really kicks the story off well and sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the game
-The villains all feel very distinct and each are fun to fight
-Game always keeps you on your toes and it is never long in between big fights
-The dollhouse made me pee my pants
-Lady Dimitrescu ; )

CONS:
-Ethan Winters is a seriously annoying protagonist. You will hear him say ""What the hell is going on?"" about ten thousand times in your play through
- Moreau and Beneviento really feel like after thoughts as villains when they are both interesting in their own rights
-I recommend that you play through on ""hard"" difficulty. I played through on ""standard"" and it felt way too easy
-I beat the game in a little over 12 hours and only did a handful of the puzzles. Even if you were to 100% all of the puzzles and collectibles, you would still beat the game in under 20 hours

FINAL THOUGHTS: Definitely worth your time if you're already a Resident Evil fan or just looking for an action game with a side helping of horror. I would wait to buy it on sale though. 7/10",1694847187,1694847187,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not a terrible game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's one of the worst Resident Evil games I have played, and judging it in the context of other games with similar prices and content (action/shooter etc.) I don't think it's that strong a game.  

I'm not exactly a purist wanting tractor controls and 3rd person, I play a lot of different games, so just ""as a game"" I found this one to be a little underwhelming based on my expectations because it is: 

1. Not particularly scary
2. Not particularly action-packed
3. Not really a good shooter
4. The story seems more like an anthology that someone found a way to make fit into one semi-coherent story

Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad game. Get it on sale and enjoy it. But it's 20 hours of mediocre shooting, not particularly scary, with a story you won't care about that much.

The Resident Evil franchise has experimented with many aesthetics and styles of horror, all being based in the realm of cinematic presentation. RE 7 really tried something new with a focus on visceral horror akin to Tobe Hooper’s Texas Chain Saw Massacre. So, it was fitting for the franchise to return to more gothic, fantastical horror, but keeping in the established canon of the Ethan Winters storyline. However, does it improve upon its predecessor?.. 

Ehhhhhhhhh not really.

Resident Evil: Village is an incredible game  with great aesthetic and familiar gameplay. Adopting a more gothic design akin to Stoker’s Dracula meets Dario Argento, the updated location of a castle and village grounds is expansive and expertly designed. It is gorgeous to look at too! The only problem I have with it is that the map feels too big for the atmosphere to be effectively scary. The brilliance of Biohazard’s map(s) was that the farm and ship felt uncomfortably intimate. The scares were more invasive instead of grandiose, but that’s probably due to the different styles of horror. However, there are moments in Hammer’s Dracula or other cult horrors like Suspiria that are far scarier than the jumpscare-y blandness of Village. Also, the horror is lessened by the reduced difficulty of standard, which felt more like easy than anything else. Despite it taking me longer to complete this one than 7, everything felt rushed and quick. 

The design is brilliant though. The creatively found in the characters is truly inspired with extreme levels of detail and nuanced voice performances. Even the mommy milker vampire lady  is a fully-realized minor antagonist with depth. The rest of the intrigue is kind of a let-down, but it’s a decent bookend to the the plot established in Biohazard, making a good two-parter for the franchise.

This game is interesting in how it expands upon the RE7 formula. 

This game really wants you to get into it as it is more action packed (using the gameplay elements from RE7) than RE7 and if you haven't played RE7 it will even tell you exactly what happened to be to be caught up to speed to get you going.

This game features Ethan Winters, a man who now has to save his daughter Rose from Mother Miranda and her lords such as Lady D. and Heisenberg, the two big personalities. He has learned to shoot and it is even reflected in how he reloads quicker and his gun handling is much better. He even has a book on it in his house. Really great details.
In contrast to RE7 he is more capable as a fighter but he also talks more and has a stronger personality. He has a great motivation to find Rose but he seems to be only about finding Rose. His personality is sometimes a bit naive and otherwise sarcastic. But he is certainly more compelling in this game than the first.
Mia interestingly in this game has a better character model. I will nitpick her model in the first game looked clammy, uncanny and her hair physics were awful. This game much like the first is quite pretty. Well detailed and filled with lived in details. 
I will say just like the first game, use the knife to save ammo as I found saving ammo this time around was harder than the first because UNLIKE RE7 this game has a shop but NO CHEST to store items. It is trying to replicate RE4 and it works but I think the chest being missing sucks.
Also weirdly enough Ethan being more experienced swings his knife twice and gets tired whereas before he could swing as much as you clicked. You can get around this by guarding after swinging twice to do more damage output. 
This game kind of encourages you to go on the offensive more and given enemies now drop money or other treasures it is encouraged to clear enemies. There is no consequence other than ammo for killing enemies. 
The game has a good story but it has some issues. Chris kills Mia in front of Ethan without giving him any time to know why Chris did such a traumatic thing leaving Ethan in the dark and then getting mad Ethan gets involved to save his daughter. A Umbrella agent even calls Chris out on this decision. Some people think this is bad writing. Some say this action by Chris is built into his personality as a flaw. I lean to the former as he should be more professional at this point in is career given the situation and how he knew Ethan would respond. I mean he even takes Rose from Ethan and talks to Ethan like a dog.  
Also Lady D is the first boss and she isn't in the game very long which can be a disappointment to some given she was a big sell for the game and the main face that people simped over. But she has a presence and a lot of personality.
Also the Lords are broken up into their own different territories and once you leave the castle you can't go back to it. But the village is a hub for the other Lords' territories. 
The DLC mostly sucks. You have to pay for a Third person view, gun charms that don't matter, and an Albert pistol you can't get in the main game that gets easily outclassed damage wise by the starting pistol. Some aspects of the DLC are neat like unlocking things you would have to unlock through challenges for free in the main game with no dlc attached.
The Shadows of Rose dlc expands upon the ending and lore. As well as Rose herself. As well as her relationship with Ethan. Its a good dlc for that but the gameplay is too linear and gimmicky to keep you busy.  
Its a solid game but some weird game design choices stop it from being really great but definitely worth a shot.

Edit: I wanted to add this game is less like the Resident Evil games of old and understandably fans, including myself don't like this direction. The devs even admitted to pulling back the horror elements from RE7 that scared little babies. The game is not very scary. It does have some survival horror elements but it is too action packed to be tense. Even RE4 outshines this game in some ways. 
This game is too generous with inventory space. You can have three guns in your inventory, one being a sniper rifle before you need to add more space. 
The castle of Lady D is lost potential as it seems bigger on the outside. You don't explore all of it. The Castle should have come last in the game or Lady D should have had more of a presence as you kill her daughters maybe her patrols around the castle become more aggressive and she isn't too hard to run around. 
You even are tricked into a more linear game where you walk into big rooms with many doors but there is usually only one way to go. Puzzles are braindead easy and the game gives you the answers to them. The game directly hands you a ring with an eye on it solve a simple door puzzle as you are progressing through the basement. Puzzle items and crafting materials don't even take up inventory space. There is even a section where you play as Chris and you just storm the front and gun down enemies without a care for supplies. The game lies to you about how big it is and the directions you take. Oddly enough the factory section is more well designed with more places to go and secret rooms to find resources. 
Crafting has become so simple as not only does it take up no inventory space unlike older titles or even RE7 but now the chem fluid mainly is used to make healing items and certain ammunition. Scrap metal plus gunpowder is used to make ammo now making crafting less of a decision making process on how you use your limited resources. 
You also must pay for for certain DLC like music, a Albert gun, a film filter, a gun charm and even the Mercenaries mode. 

I think this game is good. Quite good. It is fun and well made.
But I might actually not recommend it after I initially recommended it after thinking on it some more. Its worth a try, but Capcom has shown they are withholding content from us as they have been doing since the RE2 remake. The direction from RE7 is not ideal and this game makes a lot of odd and bad design choices for both story writing and gameplay design and level design. Resident Evil fans MAY or may not like it depending on their preference for survival horror mechanics. But don't let the name fool you. It is less like the resident evil games we love.

There may be survival horror sections, but a better descriptor would be an action-adventure spectacle with dash of horror. Village is split into several wholly different areas with a village hub. These areas are reminiscent of collecting the lord souls in Dark Souls and adventuring to the underground lava caves of Lost Izalith, or Seath’s castle called the Dukes Archives. These disparate biomes make for memorable areas with clear themes as the bosses, enemies, and set pieces all serve the cohesive vision of that segment. The level design draws obvious comparisons to the classic action-oriented predecessor Resident Evil 4, but that’s not the only connection. Game mechanics like the briefcase inventory system, the vendor that showing up in weird spots throughout, hidden gems and collectibles, and buying weapon upgrades are all stripped directly from RE4 and utilized here. If you loved RE4, Village is for you, if you’re looking for a survival horror experience, look elsewhere. Even the one pure horror segment has zero survival elements and is more akin to the likes of Amnesia or Outlast. I had a similar but different problem with RE7 not feeling like a Resident Evil game and that game had clear survival horror elements. I think, after two entries playing as Ethan, he may be the weak link. Ethan as the guy who went looking for his wife, who also got in over his head worked the first time. But for me, I have zero connection to this character. His one-liners are corny, exacerbating profanities, and the ending reveal just fell flat for me. The developer’s devotion to not showing his face is bizarre and I feel if they went this route, he should have just been a silent protagonist. With all this being said however, Village is a fun action-adventure spectacle while having a little bit of influence from almost every Resident Evil and other horror contemporaries sprinkled in. This one I recommend, but I don’t know how long I will keep playing these games if they continually push towards action and away from survival horror.

Hot tall vampire lady✅, hot villain who has been lonely for a decade✅, 3 thirsty twins✅, a ripped Chris Redfield✅. What else one could possibly want? This game is easily 11/10. Go play it now!

Now for those who want a more detailed review:

After playing the game for +50 hours, beating the main game 4 times on all difficulties, and playing the DLC twice, I can confidently say that this game is simply amazing. The story is a continuation of Resident Evil 7; you’re back in the shoes of Ethan Winters, this time in search of his daughter. I'd highly recommend you play RE7 first, because this game explains a lot from it and you’d be lost by the end without the backstory. Also, I’d recommend reading the files to fully understand what's going on. The game has a bit of everything. House Beneviento was my favourite part, it’s really scary, definitely scarier than anything from RE7. And just when you think it couldn’t get scarier, they managed to make it even more terrifying in Shadow of Rose DLC which is fantastic btw and has very emotional moments. Moving on to gameplay, it’s a lot of fun and requires some planning on higher difficulties. I feel it’s an improvement over RE7, especially the enemy design, the Lycans simply outdo the molded from RE7. The boss battles are good, especially the last two. They tried something new with the DLC and honestly, I’m all for it. If they can do it right, it could revolutionize the franchise. Graphically, the game looks amazing, running smoothly at 120 FPS on high settings @1440p. Finally, the mercenaries mode is a mixed bag imo, but it grew on me after playing for a few hours. After all, It's optional unless you're going for 100%. So if you don’t like it, skip it.",1691797891,1693425344,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My favorite part is the castle because its so beautiful. The story is good and doesn't really run for that long. The cast is diverse with 4 cool lords and one leader. Ethan, the main character is a little corny but overall a very good character and an amazing father who goings to lengths unknown to rescue his daughter, Rose.

The story, the atmosphere, the character design, LITERALLY EVERYTHING was so special to me!!! I finished this game up back in January and I'm still not over it. It has such a beautifully designed world and the depth to all of the characters is so interesting. The 4 lords are such unique and incredible antagonists. The story was so chilling I was at a loss for words sometimes. I could probably talk about the story for hours if someone let me haha. Overall the gameplay was SO fun, I've played this game fully through 4 different times because it was so fun. I love the Winters family and their story so much, we need more fathers like Ethan in this world LMAO he is the best! The concept art was so interesting to look at and reading about the inspiration for certain things and characters.

تعرف شعور الحماس الي يكون في داخلك للعبة بالنسبة لك اعظم لعبة لعبتها بالنسبة لك
و يجي ذاك الجزء الي يكون الهايب عليه عالي من المنطقة الثلجية و الفلكلور الفكتوري و الجو الي قاعدة تعطيه من التريلرات
في كيف تبيين الغموض و التساؤلات على ايش قاعد يصير بالزبط؟
فعلا كنت متحمس بشكل مرعب لرزدنت ايفل القرية
لكن ممكن هذا اكثر جزء اساسي احبطني بشكل مرعب
مهما حاولت اتقبله إلا و يجي شيء يبعص لما يذكرني باللعبة
بالمختصر اللعبة بدت بتشويق رهيب من ناحية القصة و تمشي و تشوف اللور الي قاعدة تبنيه و كيف في طائفة للأم ميراندا و الغرايب
و المشكلة إنه اهل القرية انتهوا بسرعة و التريلر كان مبيين في احداث ما انعرضت و هذا الشيء صار بسبب  الحذف
فا كانت قصص الشخصيات و الأعداء بعد مهمشة بشكل غريب
الشيء الي صدمني إنه الحذف 7 ساعات يا جماعة 7 مو وقت هييين
و اوكيه خلنا نطنش القصة فوق العيد الي صار في النهاية في حقة سبنسر ذيك

القيم بلاي

القيم بلاي يا رجل فيه تنوع و في مهام بس جافة بشكل مزعج
و الميكانيكس تعبااان ما ادري ليش بس تعبان
بس قتال اللايكن الي كويس و حرفيا تفاعلهم هم بس الي كويس اما الباقي زي الخرا
طلق و امشي ما تحس بهيبة الموقف تحس وحش عنده شوية انميشنز و خلص
و اكثر احباط جاني و جا اصحابي يوم ما قاتلت بنات دمترسك
وتفك قتالهم تافه و يوم ما تموتهم تقول بس حرفيا فكرت ذا الشعور جاني بس -_-
بس انصدمت إنه ذا الشعور بجيك على اغلب الأعداء مو بس ذولا
ما كان يجيني هيبة العدو هذيك إنه خلاص انا ميييت لأ
حرفيا ممكن بس الشعور جاني مع اللايكن في البداية و مع ميراندا في الأخير بس حرفيا
اما الباقي والله زي الخرا

بالنسبة لي الي انقذ اللعبة بشكل كبير هو إضافة روز
في افكار مليانة
تحديات حقيقة و انا قاعد العب
تعمق في القصة نوعا ما و شغلات جميلة في اللعب
ما كان فيها عناصر الشراء و هكذا زي اللعب الأصلي بس والله كانت ممتعة و الأفكار مستحيل امل من اعادتها
غير إضافة المنظور الثالث إلي عطاني منظور للأمور ما كنت منتبه لها من قبل

على العموم رزدنت ايفل 8 القرية لعبة مليانة محتوى بس ما اتقنت إلا القليل من تطبيق هذا المحتوى فااااا
لعبة ممتازة للبعض
لعبة جيدة للبعض
لعبة سيئة و إلخ
فاااااا تقييم اللعبة بالنسبة لي

The game has it's strenghts and flaws. It is like re7 with its problems solved, but made a lot of new problems or did worse than re7. Biggest difference is the easynes of the game. I on first walkthrough played on hardcore and only using the starter weapons, and i don't remember it being a lot of an challenge. Other bad thing is the way they made Chris. They made him look like a D and even recalled this in the finla act them self. And one other thing is the reapetiveness of the game, explore, find the lord, little walking with easy puzzles then a boss fight. The game went from a cutscene to another to anorher... good thing is that you can skip them. Very positive things are the improvements on Ethans charecter and the graphics. And the core gameplay was awsome. I would say the best portion of the game was when you were in the Heisenbergs place. That was the place where there were the most enemy types and you were actually able to explore! Most of the other places were very linear and boring following the same narrative.
Would i recommend re7 over re8?
Yes! Re7 has also it's flaws but i think did a lot better job. And the horror aspect was also really bad in re8. I would say that you should buy re8 if it's on sale with like 20 bucks. But i have not played the dlc so thats on me.",1693043614,1693043614,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While this game does have a lot of issues with its story, characters and horror elements, they are not mind-numbingly stupid to the point where this game is bad.

First, the how the game plays. The combat is fun and pretty rewarding. You shoot enemies; they drop loot. More difficult enemies will drop better loop that has more selling value. Some drops will be ingredients that you can use to craft ammo, healing or explosives. Surprisingly, enemies never drop ammo. There is still a problem with ammo over-abundance, however, even if you don't factor in the Duke's ammo supply. [spoiler]The game does a good job of making you face the medium difficulty enemies first, to give you a glimpse into how hard these mid-range enemies are at your current level. After defeating two of these enemies in separate one-on-one battles, you are faced with a swarm of them. The problem with the Haulers, Moroaice and Lycans is that their grab attack animations are too fast that you don't get enough of a reaction window to block them. Their regular weapon attacks are just fine, but if you anticipate a grab attack and instead they perform a weapon attack, you're forced to keep blocking for an uncomfortably long time. Most of the boss fights are pretty good, but it feels like some of the villains should have gotten more boss fights, such as Lady Dimitrescu9 in her human-escu form.[/spoiler]
Exploration is really good in this game that I even enjoy it on multiple playthroughs of the game. It's just fun to run back through parts of the map you've already been to, so that you can get treasure that becomes available. Sometimes there are even new enemies or animals available at said parts. Upgrading all the weapons is fun because of this, although I wish there was an item box to store weapons, because if you sell them, you have to buy them back at full price, complete with all attachments and upgrades (provided you have fully upgraded the weapon).
This leads me to a major gripe I have with the game, the storage space. You simply have way too much storage. I never found myself discarding items or picking what to take with me because:
a) Key items don't take up space nor do crafting items
b) Storage space is huge
c) You get storage upgrades before you need them
One fix around they tried in RE7 with the generous storage space was limiting the stack amount for ammo as well as giving you a lot of item variety to work with.
Another problem with this game is that income is scaled. You get more money on harder difficulties for some reason. This doesn't really matter, as no achievements require you to play on New Game except for your first playthrough. Still kind of stupid for players who want a challenge. If they wanted to make Village of Shadows easier for people playing New Game, they could just make the weapons start with extra upgrades or give you more weapons and items at the start of the game like in RE3R.
The story is just not that great. It's not bad, but it leaves something to be desired. [spoiler]The factory feels out of place and it could have been cut down to allow more time for Moreau or Lady Dimitrescu, who I thought were more interesting characters. The theming just didn’t work for the medieval atmosphere the game was going for. The factory is industrial but it could have gone for the Frankenstein Castle look, which also could have cut out the Lycan fortress and given more time to the aforementioned villains. Village’s story also has a problem with not explaining crucial information to the protagonist. This segways into being a problem for the characters.
Ethan has no idea what is going on the whole game, so he’s constantly asking the same thing, “What the heck is going on?” It just gets really annoying after the 29th time. Mia is also barely in the game, so you still don’t really care for her by the end of this game. Chris is just completely stupid. He doesn’t tell Ethan what is going on when he has two chances that would benefit both of them if he just spoke. The villains are interesting but they don’t have enough screen time except for Heisenberg. Heisenberg has this plan to use Rose and team up with Ethan, but he never fully explains his plan, nor does Ethan try to hear him out.[/spoiler]
Horror is hardly present in this game. Some parts are pretty scary, [spoiler]like the Vârcolac fights, the dungeon and house Beneviento (before you encounter the baby).[/spoiler] But for the most part, this game just doesn’t really try to be scary, especially with the game taking place almost entirely during the day. This was probably because too many people stopped playing Resident Evil 7, due to being too scary.

Overall, this game is worth it and I do enjoy the story even if it is lacking. The progression is what really drives this game for me.

Continuing the gameplay style that was changed with Resident Evil 7, this game also offers a richer story and provides a fantastic action horror experience that beautifully contributes an origin story to the entire series. The atmospheric horror is skillfully presented, and while the intensity of fear diminishes as our character becomes more armed, the story it tells, along with the cutscenes and boss fights, are quite successful.

The new third-person perspective is a nice nostalgia for those who loved the old games, but I believe this game should be played in first-person; it's designed with a first-person viewpoint in mind. Character designs and voice acting are also very well done. The pace of the game shifts with each chapter, aligning with the atmosphere of that particular section, pushing you to adapt. Personally, having consumed a lot of content in this genre, I was only slightly tense aside from the beginning, but I enjoyed every minute of it. A 5-star game...

The Rose DLC is the best DLC I've played in the series. It's definitely worth playing.",1692089845,1692089845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then when I got to the Village I was surprised again that you can be eaten THAT many times before you even know the controls. I struggled for a while with trying to crouch because I kept pressing the Quick-
Turn button and face-planting the enemies directly instead of crouching through the hole I was aiming for. 

Then after a while of being mauled to death I finally passed the first fight in the village and I was surprised by a large man with the shirt that is too small for his girth and he sold me cool stuff. 

I got into the big castle and then I met the large woman with the three goth daughters that raise bees and I was surprised that they didn't like me much, I liked them just fine until they bit me. I tried to find their dresses on Temu but so far no luck. 

After that, you'll be surprised by quite a lot of people who want to kill you, including a man who speaks like Buffalo Bill and seems to want to be your friend but Ethan doesn't seem to like him. Possibly because of his hat. 

The graphics are great, when you meet the sales guy you'll see what I mean, everything ripples very realistically the same as it does when I bend over. The lycans are really cool especially when you blow their head off. The goth bee women are sexy and send mixed signals just like real life. 10/10 for that. 

It has a real RE4 feel to it which is always a winner. I'm on my second time round now because I couldn't find all the collector's items because I was always just so scared and crying. This time I've only cried twice and I'm at the castle again so fingers crossed by the time I get to the giant wobbly baby that sounds like my two year old son I'll be able to concentrate this time. 

It's been a long time since I wanted to replay a game that made me wee my pants, but this one did and so I look forward to doing it again when I download the RE4 remake. 

10/10 recommend this game for any RE fan and for people who like to watch themselves get killed in fascinating ways that could have been prevented by pressing the right button at the right time.

First off, the setting is a character in itself. The creepy village and its gothic vibes? Yeah, it's like something straight out of a nightmare. Exploring every nook and cranny, just waiting for that next scare, is an experience that horror buffs like me live for.

And can we talk about Lady Dimitrescu? She's basically become the new face of the game, towering over us like a gothic supermodel with a thirst for blood. It's both terrifying and strangely fascinating. But trust me, there's more to the horror than just the lady in charge.
The story? It's like piecing together a puzzle of madness and mystery. 'Village' follows in the footsteps of the franchise by delivering a narrative that keeps you on your toes, constantly questioning what's lurking around the corner.

Gameplay-wise, it's like the perfect blend of survival and action. You're armed to the teeth, yet the tension never lets up. Puzzles, exploration, and heart-pounding combat—it's all there. Yeah, I've had my fair share of jump scares that made me spill my coffee, but that's just a testament to how immersive this game is.
In a world of horror games, 'Resident Evil Village' shines like a bloody diamond. It's a rollercoaster of terror that's got me hooked from start to finish.

The map menu is harder to control, and the mouse sensitivity is extremely slow. I have it on the highest setting (9) and it's still really slow.
The inventory system is really nice even though there's no storage chest.

One thing I love is that when you go into the inventory or craft menu the game pauses, which was really lacking in 7 when you need to craft a health kit or switch weapons/items.

The answer is Yes.

- This game takes place after the events of RE7 and in my opinion the story is pretty good in terms of Ethan's story and other characters too. My major criticism of the game in it's story is that many characters we encounter have a short scene for them and we don't explore much of their lore and we kill them early in the game, and I think it's a waste of opportunity in certain areas.

- Gameplay wise can be a mixed bag for some people, I personally like the claustrophobic combat system like what RE7 had (similarly Zombi(U) too). It did unfortunately removed the ""horror"" aspect of the game which what made RE7 scary, this game is pretty much RE4 but first person instead.

- The environment of the game is really beautiful and give 10/10 for it and you are able to explore different areas of the game which prevents it being boring.

- Now for the DLC, I personally did not like the Winters Expansion because although you get to play as Rose and an option to play it 3rd person. The DLC as a whole was not fulfilling for me personally because it reused areas of the base but it did add some horror elements but it was not enough compared to the RE7 dlcs. 3rd person is a mess for me because it's not fluid movement like RE2 & RE3 has and it feels very stiff at times.

RE8 looks good. The textures do look alike in a number of areas but they keep a realistic feel and I don't expect Resident Evil to look cartoonish any time soon. Still, titles such as RE4 and RE2 remake have textures that work so well together without looking cartoonish. 

Level Design: 5/10 
RE8's level design connects paths and makes shortcuts at the player's convenience at all times.  It becomes almost comical how often a short cut will practically create itself for Ethan Winters. In some games this is fun. In RE8 it feels stupid.

Gameplay: 5/10
You simply point and click when you need to kill something. Each gun has it's effective damage output and cool down reload. The way enemies react to gun play has much to be desired. Enemies often tank bullets like they are pellet gun ammo and you get so much ammo to use. This doesn't add to the the difficulty thankfully because most enemies move at a crawl, but playing is boring with no sense of peril. Ethan also basically can't die on standard mode unless the player has trouble with a platform obstacle or the game bugs out. I was really hoping there would be more than just run turn around and shoot here because RE8 is already lacking in the scary department so adding fun physical combat would help a lot. Maybe just a good buy able knife and a pistol that specializes in stunning enemies with weak spot shots but does no real damage. The marble ball puzzles were fun even if they didn't make sense existing.

Characters: 6/10 
My favorite part of this game is Lady Demitrescu and her castle. The player learns so much about her during their time evading her compared to the other big bosses of RE8. She is the best character and still not scary. The other big bosses aside from Miranda are all okay. The player learns their stories as they traverse their dungeons. Mother Miranda was a poorly written character and hurt my overall experience in the game a lot. 

Story: 5/10
The story starts with big plot twist that disconnected me from immersion. The game gives a good enough reason for keeping you out of the loop... at the very end of the game. The story connects decently enough to the events of Resident Evil 7 by the end.

Soundtrack is knives on a chalkboard for hours. 4/10

I will note:

-Lycans are not really fun replacement for zombies, especially in what is traditionally a Zombie series. They are also extreme bullet-sponges in the early game, ESPECIALLY on ""Hardcore"" difficulty.

-You don't (reasonably) have enough ammo to deal with every enemy like you do in RE4(R).

The gameplay is really fun! I can see the backtracking being annoying on another playthrough though.

Heavy emphasis on resource management, solving head scratching puzzles, navigating a maze-like location. I was really hoping RE8 would continue this trend but it definitely doesn't. 

I enjoyed my time with Resident Evil 8 but I don't think I'll be replaying it any time soon. 

Likes:
- Really cool characters such as Lady Dimitresque
- Beautiful landscapes and castles
- Lady D's section feels more like old school Resident Evil
- Heisenberg's section is action packed and really fun. Has a lot of dope new enemies
- Beneviento's section has a spooky set piece that really got me

Dislikes:
- Chris Redfield's explanation at the end for acting the way he does throughout the game is very very very lame. 
- Story is whatever 
- Missed opportunity to have the Lycans swarm you like the villagers in Resident Evil 4. I noticed a severe lack of them during the mid game making back tracking pretty boring. 
- The worst part about the Lycans is they're only truly challenging in the beginning of the game and at the end of the game before you get to Heisenberg. The rest of the game it feels like shooting fish in a barrel. 
- Moreau's section is boring but boss fight is alright
- Beneviento's section is just really simple puzzle solving and the ""boss fight"" at the end is looking for a puppet to press F on it 3 times.
- Too many set pieces and linearity makes replayability a chore
- The map for the village is confusing and doesn't show roadblocks
- Puzzles are stupid easy

I'd still recommend if you're an action Resident Evil fan. It's still one of the better action based Resident Evil games but I don't recommend if you're looking for more Resident Evil 2 or 7.

Castle Dimitrescu: Great start that resembles older RE game areas but is over too quickly

House Beneviento: Quite possibly the strongest area in the entire game. Great atmosphere and scares with strong P.T vibes

Moreau Reservoir: I found this area to be the weakest. A collection of poorly designed timed puzzles along with a disappointing boss fight

Heisenberg Factory: A strong area with industrial horror vibes and some solid scares that becomes a pain to backtrack until you unlock some doors

Overall 8/10. I had a lot of fun with this game.

The game play is smooth and responsive, with a first-person perspective that enhances the sense of immersion and tension. The game also offers a variety of weapons, puzzles and secrets to discover, as well as different endings depending on your choices. The game also connects to the previous Resident Evil games in clever ways, while introducing new characters and lore. The only downside of the game is the story, which is too much of a fairy tale horror for me. The game deviates too much from the realistic and grounded horror of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, and instead opts for a more fantastical and over-the-top approach that feels out of place in the series.

Right off the bat you can tell this is aiming for a completely different feel than its predecessor by taking the player away from the damp, claustrophobic Louisiana swamp house and dropping them under broad daylight in the titular Village, where the game opens up almost immediately and you’re (mostly) free to explore whichever direction that your heart’s desire. Which imo is both a good and a bad thing. 

The good being I’ve always liked the idea of having a central hub area where you can come back to for a sense of safety and brief respite from whatever crazy shit that’s going down on the outside world since my early days of playing Demons Souls, and despite being a fairly rudimentary implementation of that idea the ""village"" still serves that function. It’s weirdly comfy just strolling through this snowy, dilapidated village tucked away in some far away mountain ranges in Romania that probably hadn’t seen any outsider set foot in until a random team of video game developers from Japan pulled up and started taking pictures. What’s more the open nature of the map really allows them to play around with optional encounters. There’s now quite a few completely optional and fittingly challenging mini bosses that just roam around freely in some far away corner of the map that you’d have to go out of your way to find like in a goddamn Souls game. That sense of player discovery is unique to Village and I appreciate it. 

The bad being, well almost everything else, really. It hasn’t been that long since my most recent playthrough of RE7 and it really solidified what a masterclass particularly in level design that it was. There’s a lot of intricacies within the Baker House that make it feel like it was designed by a group of veteran architects whose main concern was not to build a house that could realistically exist, but one that’s fun to get around in; intricacies that are sadly lost within the wide, open field geography of the village. Open area with a lot of freedom to move around in is just infinitely less interesting to me and probably requires considerably less effort to design, too, than a confined space where you have to constantly rely on your map to navigate, like in RE7. There are some resemblance of that here in the factory section which is a step in the right direction, but it’s a step too small, and too late because within two hours of you getting there the game is over. 

But I’m getting way ahead of myself. This is where I need to start talking, or complaining, rather, again, about the four different sections that this game is split into. I wanna preface by saying all four of these sections are good, just not in ways that make a RE game good. 

First off we have the castle, which for all intents and purposes is your ""traditional"" RE experience. Or so I’ve heard, until I played it for myself. Because aside from the gothic visuals this entire section is a pretty far cry from your classic RE formula. The layout is too linear and there’s no routing involved whatsoever. All that branching paths is merely an illusion, a ruse to trick your brain into thinking the map is more open ended than it actually is. When in reality it’s pretty much on rails with the occasional, very scripted appearances of a pursuer type enemy to funnel you down a single corridor. It’s a thrilling haunted house ride but none of it feels very organic like in RE7 or the RE2 Remake. Speaking of enemy unless my eyes are deceiving me I’m pretty sure the hooded blind dead (yes that is a Tombs of the Blind Dead reference) share the same animation skeleton with the possessed medieval armor in the RE4 Remake. I would know because as soon as I saw that sword swing animation my muscle memory kicked in and I almost went in for a parry, until I realized I was playing as Virgin ""where is my wife and daughter"" Ethan, not Chad ""Kill zombies. Behead zombies. Roundhouse kick a zombie into the concrete. Blow zombie heads with magnums. Suplex zombies. Feed zombies to lickers. Throw zombies into lava. Blow zombies up with rocket launchers"" Leon. Shame. Another nitpick I have to get out of my system is that the castle doesn’t feel very… castly. It may resemble a castle on the outside but as soon as you step through that castle gate it’s like you’re transported to an entirely different structure where the interior could best be described as Spencer Mansion meets Goldener Saal. Now I don’t mean to endlessly heap praise on the RE4 Remake but this is where I have to once again for it really nailing the look and feel of being inside of a medieval castle. 

On to the next section House Beneviento which I think is masterful. Not in terms of gameplay because there barely is any since it’s just a walking simulator with some light puzzle elements thrown in but the buildup of tension is masterfully done. It’s almost 90% buildup with a very gradual escalation and a simmering score in the background but without that buildup the remaining 10% payoff wouldn’t be as worth it. It’s so good in fact that they remade this entire segment pretty much beat for beat in the Shadow of Rose DLC, and it’s just as terrifying if not more so the second time I tell ya. 

Then there's the reservoir which is a platforming section that plays like a 2D Mario game with the most jank boat control you’ll ever experience in a video game. There’s nothing more to say about it really because it’s a nothing burger of a segment that exists only to pad out the length. At least it’s mercifully short. 

Finally we arrive at the factory which I think is the best section for reasons I’ve mentioned earlier. It’s the only section that resembles a classic RE game with its own unique twist on the key hunting and a non linear progression. The rusty, industrial aesthetic, the killer ambiance, and the literal Frankenstein's Army that are the enemies you face off against also do a lot of heavy lifting in making this entire area my absolute favorite. 

At this point you might begin to notice the biggest issue I had with this game overall and that’s a complete lack of tonal consistency and consistency within the locations. Aside from the fact that geographically they all link back to the same village there really isn’t any cohesion between these locations. They feel and play so different from one another it’s hard not to pit them against each other and choose a favorite, like I just did. Hell even RE Revelations, the LITERAL episodic RE game, feels less disjointed than this one.

At some times I even found myself running back and forth for 10s of minutes, which does take away from the experience and atmosphere.

This game, like 7, has an incredibly addicting game play loop, up there with games like RE7, Half-Life Alyx, and to an extent the original Half-Life. This game really and truly feels like a mix of all of the best elements of Resident Evils 4 and 7. Take the survival elements of 4, such as being able to hunt animals like chickens and fish for food, inventory, huge mutated boss fights, and the most god-awful, cringe inducing one-liners you have ever heard, mixed with 7's insanely creepy approach to horror in sections like House Beneviento. I would recommend this to anyone who liked either 4 or 7. Plus theres Lady Dimitresqu.

- Very good atmosphere
- Generous and varied in its content (multiple weapons, situations, etc...)
- A slightly more open play area without diluting the storytelling
- Some surprising passages
- Fights a little more interesting than those of Resident Evil VII

- Weak points :
- Unlike its predecessor, no VR
- The structure, almost identical to  RE VII
- Repetition in certain sequences, clichés, implausibilities...
- The fear/action balance in favor of powder

Summary : More successful than its predecessor from which it shamelessly steals its structure, Resident Evil Village is a complete experience filling with a quiet force all the boxes necessary for the success of a survival-horror in first person action-oriented view. Although it draws its inspiration from the bottom of the Spanish dungeons belonging to Resident Evil 4, the title of Capcom manages to pull out of the game thanks to its atmosphere tinged with original fantasy for the saga. The unforgivable absence of virtual reality and the presence of a feeling of “already played” prevent him from claiming the title of eminent leader of the village. However, not enough to initiate a quarrel: this Resident Evil is a success.

- Very pretty. There are some quite imperfect areas, such as clearly 2D grass and other things the game does not manage to hide very well and slightly break immersion, but, at least, the performance is very acceptable even with ray tracing on, so it's still pretty fair.  The game really misses DLSS though, being the main graphical downside of this game.
- Very cool and/or badass cutscenes, and very cool extra Village of Shadows story. One significant issue is that you can't re-watch the dubbed version of it on the Extras menu, as it is hardcoded to english on the main menu version, so that's a significant and annoying oversight.
- Gameplay is usually around a 7/10. Some parts of the game are too easy to get lost in, or you have to walk all the way back, and that could be better, The default difficulty is a bit too easy and most bosses died on the first or second try, yet I'd be scared of the hardest difficulty so I couldn't go for it.
- Some of the ""water boss"" section is very annoying. The water platforms that fall and instakill you are unfair, tend to oneshot you and just aren't fun, alongside with some similar mechanics on that area. That boss fight itself was pretty meh too so it felt like that entire section was not worth it and not as good as the rest of the game
- Good atmosphere and gameplay balance overall. Fun progression.
- Several bits of good AI, enemies that already attack you as they're coming out of the ground unlike other games or being dragged out of your safe spot by an enemy that knows he can't reach you there just makes the game so much more scary as the enemies are not robotic and those interactions really caught my attention by how much they improved my experience. On the other hand, there are a few bits of bad AI, like Dimitrescu being extra dumb when chasing you, or that clunky fight in a small space against the giant near the end of the game - though if those bits were improved AI-wise, the section would become too hard or too annoying on the current design, and the game ended up going with the dumb route - though thankfully that is only in a few minor parts of the game.
- DLC is too expensive, so I didn't get to play it

RE8 is very reminiscent of RE4 from monsters, aesthetic and gameplay.  Story is solid and comes and hints/ties some foundational stuff up.  But honestly, the 3rd person vantage is probably what sold me.  RE2 and RE3 remakes ditched the fixed camera angles and rocked the 3rd person, so it's an easy transition back into the RE series for me after ripping those.  I'd still enjoy fixed though, just not that 1st person non-sense (skipped Survivor and RE7...)

Solid 8/10 for me.  Only really loses points because these games (since RE4) have had too much QTE and similar mechanics.

ive had this in my libary for a while and felt ""eh gowan then lets give it a crack"". bare in mind before i go further this is my first resident evil game so any problems i have that are a series staple know this... i really dont care. 

a bit of quick backstory as well, im an indie game developer currently working on a horror game my self so i wanted to play this for inspiration and to see what i could learn from too. 

now to the game. 

the level design and atmospehere was absolutally incredible. the gameplay and the way gun combat works really accents how they want guns to really POP and it becomes rewarding later on in the game when you start blasting lycans in the head with a fully upgraded shotgun. i dont know if its my dark souls back ground or the game is designed to make you feel powerful but it felt amazing. 

there were times however where i was frustrated and that was the boss battles. they where great but i really couldnt tell how much damage i was doing and scrambling for ammo with no hope is just tedious and boring because the fights were not particularly hard as the game had no real dodge mechanic. they where still very well designed and made however. 

the player health as well was always a mystery. so thats my one gripe SHOW THE PLAYER HOW LONG THINGS HAVE TO DIE. that and i find rose ugly and mia annoying and expressionless.

i loved the castle the most and avoiding vampires tickled a soft spot for me as i adore that kind of setting. 

each levels visuals appeared to get better and better. 2 days (7hr 30 minutes) to complete is the minimum standard but i felt the game could have gone further. 


i dont know what it is however but while i did enjoy the game and it really felt like it kept going on tangents and ""get x amount of objects to progress"" which led to moments where i felt lost. i think the village and castle should have been the focus the whole time. so for that i would have to give village an 8.7/10",1689374415,1689374415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1][b] PROS [/b][/h1]
⚫I personally love how the ""Village of Shadows"" story book is the actual story for the game. How Moreau is the Fish King, Heisenberg is the Iron Steed, Donna Beneviento is the Dark Weaver and Lady Dimitrescu is the Bat Lord, the 3 black bats are her daughters (as a massive DRACULA fan I appreciated this so much with the references to Dracula's Brides). All controlled by the Witch, Miranda.
⚫Animations are amazing for Ethan and enemies alike.
⚫Puzzles are not overly complicated and not stupidly easy either. I did find myself occasionally scratching my head but then I remember ""Did I inspect this object yet"", haha.
Game has a heavy emphasis on exploration to find lore and hidden items such as guns, gun parts and treasure to sell to make some money.
⚫Story was amazing from start to finish. It honestly blew me away. I, WE all really needed this story. Resident Evil is FINALLY back on top. 
⚫Some of the most memorable boss fights in the series so far and characters (Ok, who will forget Lady Dimitrescu after all that XXX of her)
⚫Soundtrack is AMAZING. Especially the ending song for Resident Evil Village is just fucking awesome. I just cannot get enough.
⚫They also added back in the popular mercenaries mode which adds TONNES of replayability.
⚫You can grab yourself even more content as there is a decent DLC for Village - Winters Expansion.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpp_1J2jyjs Amazing song. 
If it gets removed just type in youtube or spotify -  Yearning for Dark Shadows

[h1][b] CONS [/b][/h1]
⚫When ethan swaps weapons... he has 4 arms basically. You need to see it to see what I mean but if you swap weapons really fast you can see another set of arms on that weapons as you swap quickly between them.
(I could not think of anything else wrong with the game but this. Its PERFECTION in a nutshell)

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1]
I cannot recommend this game enough. I love it. The story and characters.... the modding and freedom you are given... its just what Resident Evil should be. With the new RE Engine added in the game looks absolutely stunning and to top that off the amount of mods you can get out there for this game... what can I say... this game is truly AMAZING.

This is an alright third person shooter with a horror setting but a pretty terrible Resident Evil/Biohazard game.  If you've never played RE or don't generally care for the series this will probably be a fun shooter romp for you!  Long time RE fans shouldn't pay more than 20 bucks for this.  Solid 5/10.

Spoilers:
[spoiler]
This game has literally no purpose in the RE universe other than ""Oh wow, werewolves and vampires are canon now.""  RE isn't a series I hold to a strong story with consistent narrative and plot; but this one doesn't make even a single ounce of effort.  Oh, Miss D. and her 3 daughters are weak to cold?  Good thing they live in the mountains where it's perma-winter.  Oh, and Miss Ds bugs are weak to cold except in the last fight against her where you have to hide inside, away from the cold, to disperse her bugs because the devs have no consistency ever in this game.  

Oh, and Miss D's weakness?  A knife with a bunch of poisons on it that she keeps in her house and never cleaned the poisons off of for...reasons...and then she waits to attack you until you open a coffin and grab the knife in the slowest animation ever.  Because the devs couldn't bother making her first phase weakening her enough that the knife isn't guarded anymore.  They also couldn't make the mansion a mission of getting the poison so you can stab her...instead you get masks to get the knife that has the convenient poisons.  Like...ANY EFFORT...ANY EFFORT AT ALL...and the game could make sense but the writers are not good at their jobs.

Oh, and Miss D that got Twitter all horny, the only reason this game is well reviewed and liked is because twitter got horny for Miss D btw, is only in the game for about 30 minutes.  She's the first boss.  She's not important to the plot at all other than she was there.  

This RE entry also features more walking simulator segments than anything I've ever seen in RE before.  If you really like walking around doing nothing but listening to dialogue and avoiding a giant insta-kill fish...this game has you covered.

There was exactly one (1) fun segment in this whole game: Heisenberg.  The voice actor for H had so much fun with his role and you could really feel it.  The combat in that section was genuinely engaging, the progression felt like old RE progression, and the final fight for that segment felt so epic that they should have just ended on it tbh.  It was perfect.  That section should have been the whole game really.  Just expand it. 

The actual final fight was extremely mid however.  Run in a circle, shoot, run in a circle, shoot, shoot 3 orbs, run in a circle, shoot, repeat.  RE final fights tend to be a let down, so I wasn't surprised, but I wanted a bit more after how epic the preceding fight had been.

Lastly, the DLC.  The DLC was complete garbage.  50% walking sim, 40% Dragon's Lair love letter (QTE sim), 10% actual gameplay.  The final boss was the same final boss from the base game too; which didn't help.  The game tried to make Miranda returning a plot twist; but it was incredibly obvious that Rose was being manipulated by her from the start.

3/5

I’m really conflicted about this game. There is so much to like, the setting the characters, the callback to RE4 are all very well done. The return of the “Merchant” titled “The Duke.” The music and sound effects are well done and most of the battles are entertaining. I think my issues with the game it that it tries to be Resident Evil 4 without trying to be its own thing and unfortunely relies of the nostalgia factor. To me RE7 is flat out the better game because of how fresh it was and while the feeling of helplessness was tough at first it eventually became understandable on how to play the game.

RE8 meanwhile just feels off in how they want you to play the game. At first you are completely helpless just like in the last game but over time it becomes much more of a run and gun time game. With that said however the aiming is not great and the general idea of just running in circles to avoid an enemy gets very repetitive especially with most of the boss battles at the end.

I also don’t understand why Chris Redfield’s character becomes so absolutely useless to our main character and the lack of information characters share with each other becomes quite a nuisance. With that said the game certainly is not bad but I would argue unfulfilling. While the characters are interesting we barely get much time with each of Miranda’s “children.” It’s also a big point that there is just a lot of empty parts going on in the game and it feels less like an exploration and more of a to do list. Having so many things revealed early on doesn’t help things either.

Spoilers: I’m not sure how I feel about Ethan, Mia or Rose. I guess Ethan’s story makes sense and it certainly explains a lot of things but Mia still being alive and the mystery of Rose that is just never explained becomes frustrating. Miranda in general is really boring because we flat out do not interact with her at all until the very end. Heisenberg and really all the other children were far more interesting and much more interaction with our main character.

All in all the game does a lot of things right but I think in an effort to recapture the RE4 magic it lost what had made RE7 so refreshing and we are left with a game that doesn’t know what it wants to be.

The entire game is a mashup of different concepts from several other Resident Evil games:[list]
[*]Storywise is reminiscent of Barry's European excursion from Revelations 2: extremely similar main plot, setting, AND themes. Though the Eastern European setting is more original in Rev2, since it isn't just RE4's village+castle combo, it's a post-Soviet era town with surroundings.
[*]Speaking of RE4: the setting, the desperate defense from a horde of enemies in the beginning, a merchant, upgrading weapons and inventory capacity, no item box, finding treasures, a fish boss. Even the head explosions are similar. There's also a doll based ""boss"", which seems to be a concept from one of the early versions of RE4.
[*]Mercenaries mode is Revelations 2 Raid Mode with 2% of the content. At best.
[*]RE7's first person camera and a few characters like Ethan.[/list]

There are many problems with simple mechanics:[list]
[*]Enemies are fairly damage spongy even on Standard difficulty.
[*]Hitboxes on enemies and their attacks are inconsistent, e.g. sometimes they attack you through walls (Moreau’s spit), their attack which is supposed to be blocked by terrain, isn’t (Urias), they can damage you in cutscenes (going inside the safe room for the first time in the castle while being chased by Lady D), enemies with thrusting drill attacks (Soldats) have hitboxes so large you’d swear they were swipes.
[*]Some of the boss arenas are poorly designed. What are these areas with the Urias fights supposed to be? Small, cramped spaces against a giant wielding a huge double handed hammer who can spin to win? 2 of the 3 fights against Dimitrescu’s daughters are also 2x2 meter rooms or corridors so narrow you have absolutely no room to maneuver.
[*]There are locations where the enemies just stop pursuing you and walk away after you cross an invisible line. They do not regenerate their health, so it’s easily exploitable.[/list]

My other issues:[list]
[*]No FoV option, even though it was present in RE7. 
[*]To quit the game you have to press Delete; you cannot use the mouse.
[*]Inventory management is pointless. If you buy the larger attache cases, you will only run into inventory issues on your NG+ runs. On your fresh save you don’t have to do anything.
[*]Takes a while to get to the game proper. A ton of cutscenes and scripted sequences at the beginning make repeated playthroughs a chore.
[*]Enemies spam grab moves which have animations so long you'd think they're death animations. Some of them are nearly 10 seconds long. On Village of Shadows difficulty it's even worse.
[*]Puzzles are lackluster. There's one statue puzzle in the castle that has a description more confusing than the actual puzzle.
[*]Ethan behaves either like a badass or a total wimp. It's really jarring and inconsistent. He's also constantly commenting on everything, in contrast to RE7 where he barely reacted to anything: I preferred him mostly silent.[/list]

Biggest positives:[list]
[*]Looks absolutely gorgeous.
[*]I like the Metroidvania gameplay of the village itself.
[*]The combat is satisfying.[/list]

They tried to appeal to both horror and action fans, and while RE6 failed spectacularly in this endeavour, Village appears to have succeeded when looking at the general reception. For me, however, while it's a significantly better game than RE6, it's still unfocused. Each section is distinctly different from the other. It’s theme park horror by design. RE7 was laser focused: it knew what it was and what it wanted to be from start to finish. RE7 was a labor of love. Village seems a corporate creation.

It's still a good game. I finished it several times in a row. But it's a disappointment and I don't think I'll ever touch it again after unlocking all achievements.


Shadows of Rose[list]
[*]The mannequin bit was outstanding. Too bad it lasted only a few minutes and was followed by an awful stealth section that was way too long.
[*]Great scares ruined by a protagonist who doesn't shut up.
[*]Constant re-use of locations.
[*]Unfulfilled potential with the Mutamycete storing memories: they could’ve shown more Lord backstories, or even the Bakers again.
[*][spoiler]Capcom went to comedic lengths to hide Ethan’s face.[/spoiler][/list]",1688376683,1688376898,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In fact, I had just written Resident Evil off and decided to ignore 7 and then later on 8. I was one of the many RE fans that didn't really like how the series went with the success of 4. I liked 4, found 5 to be meh and I didn't play 6 because I heard from reviews that it was basically a pure action game and the survival horror bits from old were pretty much all thrown out, and those were my favorite parts from the RE series. The claustrophobic feeling, finding keys and solving puzzles, all the while killing monsters and worriedly watching your precious ammo dropping, wondering when you'll find more. Those were my favorite parts of the RE games. And they were slowing moving away from that, and with 4, started in a new direction. So I figured 6 killed the franchise since I'd heard it didn't do well and so wrote RE off. But like the zombies of old, they rose again with RE 7. At first I was excited, they were coming back to their survival horror roots, yay! They were bringing back the keys, puzzles and central locations, yay! And it was FPS... crap!
The thought of an FPS Resident Evil filled me with dread and confusion. I thought they were just jumping on the bandwagon of those survival horror games like Alien Isolation, the Amnesia series, Slenderman and all those other FPS games that pitted you against some horrible monster that you couldn't kill, or didn't even have weapons like with some games of the genre. So I wrote off 7 and 8 and just hoped for something better. Then the remakes came along and I was revitalized. With the 40th anniversary of Capcom putting all the RE games on sale, I decided to bite the bullet and fill out the rest of my collection and snap up 5, 6, 7, and 8 for the PC. 7 and 8 are very damn good. I was, quite frankly, shocked and amazed at how good they are. They are pure Resident Evil, all the keys and puzzle solving, limited ammo but enough to kill everything you run into if you aim right and make the right crafting choices. I also was ashamed of myself for not giving 7 or 8 a chance and ignoring them all these years. I might be late to the party, but I finally got here and I am completely enjoying myself.
Bottom line, if you are a fan of the game style of the older games, the puzzle solving, the keys and the claustrophobic feeling of the environment, then 7 and 8 will be welcome editions to your Resident Evil collection!",1687797650,1687797650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Village is legitimately more terrifying than RE7 if you rely on the knife/blocking + throwables/mines. 
Only use the guns when absolutely necessary. (trust in the light~~)
(just pretend you don't have enough ammo to kill everything at the start)
 
Looking at the map often to memorize routes and running past enemies instead of fighting to conserve ammo feels so much like classic Silent Hill.

obviously, play on hardcore~ 
Very early on at the start of the game, there's an area that feels rigged and you have to find places to hide from the lycan attack.
But the overwhelming feeling of gloom and dread because everything is actually capable of killing you for the rest of the game makes it worth pushing through.

but as usual, RE becomes an action game towards the last couple of hours which is ok I guess.",1687578053,1687578053,True,5,1,0.518098533153533936,0,True,False,False

This one is Ethan Winters' very own Resident Evil 4. You get the intro with a village filled with monsters, the castle tour, the giant aquatic monster, the hordes of monsters, the merchant of dubious origins seemingly everywhere, the weapon upgrades... I like both formulas so I'm fine with it, but it's interesting to see how different those two games are.

I very much liked this opus. It might be because I don't play that many AAA games, but I'm quite impressed by the level of graphical quality. I think it's a very beautiful game. I feel it's important to note that the game handles brightness much better than Resident Evil 7 did. You can actually see what's happening, and you don't have to wait every few seconds for the silly simulated eye adaptation to stop fiddling with the luminosity. The gameplay is standard action Resident Evil fare, except for the lack of melee hits. The progression is a tad weird because the game plays the four heavenly kings one emperor card straight but only two of those five enemies really feel fleshed out. The other three mostly look like quickly thrown-together arcs made just to keep to the original five arcs plan.

The game is of standard Resident Evil length: 2-3 hours if you rush, 8-16 during your first run. After your first run you unlock a new game mode, a new difficulty and a bunch of cheats that become available by getting the game's achievements like in the Resident Evil 2 remake. The additional game mode isn't that good in my opinion, and is mostly about speedrunning through the story levels with different enemy placement and weapons to earn a high score.

The main complaint that I have after putting down the game is about something relatively small, but it really sours my entire impression of it: you're forced to watch a bunch of stuff countless times over. I find it particularly irritating that despite the fact that the developers put in a way to skip cutscenes, they made a conscious effort to make it crappy. They introduced a system that makes it so that for most cutscenes, there will be a pretty long delay between the start of the cutscene and the moment when you can actually skip it. The way they do this is by disabling the game's menu for a time. They also use the same system quite often when you're grabbed by an enemy, making it impossible to go to the menu and choose restart for a few seconds. It is a problem common to lots of games and it is always very irritating, but for this one I'd even call it puzzling, because it's clearly not a mistake or an oversight, but truly intentional, and I just can't begin to comprehend what could go through a guy's head that'd make him waste time to implement something actively bad like that. There's also the issue of some cutscenes not being identified as such and thus being unskippable by default.

In short, it's pretty good but who's the idiot that thought forcing players to sit through cutscenes and grabbing animations was a good idea? Especially in a game series that has always strived for replayability. Please fire that guy. Really.",1687275483,1687275483,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I loved playing this fantasy horror game and I am willing to discuss this puzzle, supplement system and bosses. 

After the dark village story is difficult to level as a tough time as two days. So, I ridiculously got jumpscare in a few times and felt nervous-hand, passive-aggressive and brave movement. I was hunting puzzles for solutions, and the supplement system seemed rushed for no reason. At least I got good or bad luck in crates. Easily between medium to fight the Four Lords and Mother Miranda and my favourite RE villain character is Karl Heisenberg. 

Moving forward to the development of Resident Evil 9 or not (Hopefully praying), we want to see Rosemary and Chris's next story after RE: Village.

Combat was... well, boring. Yeah you can aim for the legs to maybe stun the enemy, but still. There's no real TENSION like there is with RE7, cus in this game, you regen any damage you take in mere seconds.
Inventory management was useless.
Didn't capture much of what RE7 had to offer. The part where the fetus chases you was terrifying, though.
Feels less like a survival horror than a singleplayer FPS.
Map's way too big, incredibly easy to get lost.


It's a good play, but DEFINITELY get RE7 instead of this.

Why do I recommend?
When compared to RE7, it's... lackluster, to say the least. But it is still an enjoyable* game.

*enjoyable when you're NOT aimlessly wandering around the maze of a map it has.

RE7's a tough act to follow, to be fair. I've only played RE7 and this, so I cant say anything about how it compares to other games

OH AND ALSO!
Text syncing with cutscenes was AWFUL. Maybe it was just my settings, but voice lines happened a solid 1-4 seconds before the characters said whatever line, or the subtitles appeared. RE7 dont have this issue.

THERE ARE A FEW POSITIVES, THOUGH!
When we encounter the first wolf-like miniboss thing, it bugged to where it kept running to the door and I could knife it, was very silly and funny.
The Duke's a good addition, me thinks.
Graphics are good, and it got a solid start... mostly.

Overall, I give this game a 6.8/10, still above 5 so i guess i recommend it.",1686866137,1686866970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are solid.  But the rest is pretty average or just bad.
Story is RE6 awful.  Way way way too many cut scenes and loss of character control moments.
Combat is too simple and boring.  No where near as suspenseful and frightening as RE7.  Didn't feel like a survival horror at all.  Felt like there was no important decision making to be had anywhere, just very linear.

Found myself just going through the motions to just finish it.  Dragged on forever.

Save your money.

Resident Evil 8, the latest installment in Capcom's long-standing survival horror franchise, presents an intriguing blend of familiar elements and novel innovations. One of the most striking aspects of the game is its aesthetic and gameplay similarities to BioShock Infinite, a critically acclaimed first-person shooter developed by Irrational Games. This comparative review will explore these parallels and their implications for the overall gaming experience.

Firstly, the visual design of Resident Evil 8 is reminiscent of BioShock Infinite's distinctive aesthetic. The game's setting, a mysterious European village, is imbued with a sense of eerie beauty that mirrors the floating city of Columbia in BioShock Infinite. The architectural design, color palette, and atmospheric lighting in Resident Evil 8 all echo the art direction of BioShock Infinite, creating a similarly immersive and visually stunning environment.

The gameplay mechanics of Resident Evil 8 also bear a striking resemblance to those of BioShock Infinite. Both games blend elements of exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat in a seamless manner. The player is encouraged to explore their surroundings thoroughly, uncovering secrets and resources that aid in their survival. The combat in both games is intense and strategic, requiring the player to make effective use of their limited resources against formidable enemies. The presence of powerful, unique adversaries in both games—akin to BioShock Infinite's Handyman or Resident Evil 8's Lycans—adds an additional layer of challenge and unpredictability to the combat scenarios.

Also, the narrative structure of Resident Evil 8, while retaining the franchise's signature horror elements, incorporates themes of existential dread and moral ambiguity that were central to BioShock Infinite's storyline. The player is confronted with complex characters and moral dilemmas that blur the line between good and evil, echoing the narrative depth and complexity of BioShock Infinite.

However, it is important to note that these similarities do not detract from Resident Evil 8's unique identity. The game retains the franchise's core survival horror elements, such as the tension-filled exploration of hostile environments and the constant threat of gruesome enemies. Furthermore, the game introduces new mechanics, such as the ability to block and counter enemy attacks, which add a fresh dimension to the gameplay.

Lastly, Resident Evil 8's aesthetic and gameplay similarities to BioShock Infinite contribute to a rich and immersive gaming experience. These parallels, combined with the game's unique elements, result in a compelling blend of familiarity and innovation. While Resident Evil 8 clearly draws inspiration from BioShock Infinite, it successfully integrates these influences into its own distinctive framework, thereby enhancing the franchise's legacy and appeal.",1686829870,1686829870,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I went for a walk and came across this old European whistle-stop.  No one was burning the police tied to a stake but as soon as I started breaking and entering into these tore up wigwams a hobo pulls me through the floor and nearly bit my traffic finger off which instigated a snickersnee I barely won and not before alerting a dozen or so of the hooligan's associates.  So there they all are giving me stink eye from the roof tops and the minute I get back to my burglary spree they start howling for their mates to bum rush me.  I feel obliged to fashion a rampart out of some gaudy Ikea crap by the door and we commence a staredown until their buddy Andre the Giant rolls up with a hammer to extirpate my blockade forthwith.  Even after fulminating the nearest barrique I have to make for the roof before I find a truncheon embedded into my breast pocket.  No sooner have I stood on a shingle before this rabble has taken to firing crossbows from the neighboring gambrel and they do not cease even after I Mario back to the thoroughfare and make for a nearby wicket.  Everything starts moving in slow motion and I think all we need now is some maniac-wielding chainsaw to put a cherry on top of this here fiasco.  I am quickly brought back to the present as a bolt pierces my shank so hard I think I may never skedaddle again.  Much to my chagrin Andre has caught up to get me mirandized for the act of fornication I am about to receive and wouldn't you know it the Krispy Kreme is now open so I get to talk to grandma.

Resident Evil Village, and I must say that it exceeded all my expectations. 

This game masterfully combines an immersive and captivating narrative with refined mechanics, creating an unforgettable gaming experience.

The narrative is intricately woven, keeping players on the edge of their seats with every twist and turn. It expertly blends horror, mystery, and even elements of folklore, creating a chilling atmosphere that keeps players engaged from start to finish.

[hr][/hr]
The characters in Resident Evil Village are memorable and well-developed, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations. 

The game's antagonist, Lady Dimitrescu, became an iconic figure even before the game's release, and rightfully so. Her imposing presence and the enigmatic nature of her vampiric family add an extra layer of intrigue to the game's narrative. And let's not forget the splendid performance by Neil Newbon, who just nailed Heisenberg's eccentric and daring nature.

[hr][/hr]
The game strikes a fine balance between exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving, providing a satisfying gameplay loop, [b]except for the Beneviento Mansion[/b]. The first-person perspective intensifies the feeling of vulnerability and helps immerse players in the game's unsettling world.

The addition of the merchant, Duke, provides a welcome respite from the horrors, allowing players to upgrade their weapons and replenish their supplies.

[hr][/hr]
Unfortunately, the Beneviento Mansion suffers from a lack of random events, that could make the encounter a little bit more startling and scary. If you played the story once, I believe you will not feel the same way. 

[hr][/hr]
I played the game for 5 times and did every challenge, except for 3, and had fun all those runs. I highly recommend the game if you want to experience a wonderful story with engaging puzzles and mechanics.",1686512523,1686512598,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also the DLC is great. The first mercenary mode that I actually want to play. Getting to speed run and try the different gun combinations could easily take upwards of 5-10 hours to finish.

If you can get it on sale for like, 10-20 bucks, go for it, but it was absolutely not worth the $70 or whatever I spent on it at launch. There are some absolutely outstanding chunks of this game, notably the first two or so hours are fantastic, and the mid-card haunted dollhouse is crazy fucking good, maybe some of the best interactive horror content I've ever played. 

Now that I've complimented it, this game is pretty bad on average. It really lacks any grounding characters. The antagonists are kinda fun in a camp horror kind of way, but they all overstay their welcome a bit just due to the nature of this being a video game and not a b-horror movie. The entire last half of the game is truly awful as well, in all respects besides visual. It dives deep into being utterly nonsensical in a really frustrating way. 

To sum up my feelings, the best sequence in the game is a stripped-back encounter with a scary monster in a small haunted house. The worst sequence in the game sees you climb into a mech suit, then chainsaw a boss to death with your mold-powers. This is NOT a game that knows what it's going for, and it makes me really worried about RE IX, whenever that comes out.",1686306302,1686306302,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Puzzles are pretty much non-existent now, and the game is extremely linear. There is almost no exploration or wandering around. The combat is piss-baby easy and boils down to ""pump the enemy full of lead as fast as possible"" with very few exceptions. Apart from the [spoiler]fetus encounter[/spoiler] and a few darker sections in Heisenberg's factory, Village is entirely absent of spooks. 

The plot and characters are handled abysmally as well. I expect dumb, cheesy stories and characters from RE. This is just incomprehensible. Ethan is one of the worst video game protagonists I've seen in a long time. Chris Redfield's reboot is stupid. The much-hyped Lady Dimitrescue is a far inferior version of Mr. X and is only around for the first quarter of the game, if that. There was no reason for [spoiler]Ethan to not take Heisenberg's deal, or for his daughter to be split into four different parts, or for Chris to not tell Ethan what was going on.[/spoiler] The entire concept of the mold is utterly stupid, as is the retconning of RE lore to fit with the schizo plot of this game. I'm glad this is apparently the last we'll see of [spoiler]Ethan Winters[/spoiler] and one can only hope the next first-person installment has entirely new characters.

It has a great Gothic art style, there is lots of back tracking and unlocking new paths that eventually lead to short cuts back to areas you need to return to. ammo and items in general are scarce and enemies are few but challenging. There are puzzles to solve (not particularly challenging but challenging enough for me) and key items to collect as you would expect from a resident Evil game. 

The characters are great and the voice acting is top notch.

Graphics are also fantastic here, i have a low end PC (Ryzen 5 2600x, AMD R580) so on something more powerful im sure this looks even better. The character design looks great and the faces especially can look quiet real at times. 

There is also a VR mod which is amazing although my PC does stutter at times when i try this mod probably as its just not powerful enough.

Overall i can see why this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews. I grabbed this in a sale for a bargin price and i highly recommend it even if you are not a huge Resident Evil or survival horror fan in general (like me) i think you will enjoy it.

Some people break into your house you and your wife and daughter are getting kippnaped and a crash afterwards brings you in a little village which seems left. Youre searching for help, when you suddenly get caught by a crazy old man and then all of a sudden the shit is burning. Every single one of the characters is amazing and the different show places *moan*, its crazy how much work the devs put into this game. 
Anyways, as always, the gunfight were spectacular and the weapons were to nice. My favourite was the sinper rifle. Whatever boss you were fighting against, it was your way to go. 
I did enjoy playing this game, even when I shit my pants maybe a bit to often but who cares.

The action is good and there are some horror moments, but there are are few of them.
On the graphical side, the engine and the art direction do a superb job, the game looks very good and runs well too.

The only big problem is that the game is way too simple, enigmas do not impose a real challenge, every solution is way too simple or too close to the player to get you in real trouble, there's no challenge at all on standard difficulty.
The challenge and game time are also virtually inflated by the fact that you can't unlock all upgrades for your weapons, it imposes the player to replay the game several times. I would have prefered a complete adventure on one playthrough with better balancing.

Resident Evil Village takes the beloved survival horror series to new heights, delivering a spine-tingling adventure that will have you clutching your controller for dear life... and occasionally snorting with laughter. With its mix of creepy ambiance, pulse-pounding action, and a story that's a little more out there than usual, this game is a wild ride that deserves its almost-perfect score of 9.6 out of 10.
Prepare to be immersed in a world of gothic horror and supernatural weirdness. From the moment you step into the village, you'll be greeted by towering castles, mist-filled forests, and a bunch of weirdly friendly locals. The stunning graphics bring every grotesque creature and hauntingly beautiful environment to life in vivid detail. It's like a haunted house comes to life with slightly better Wi-Fi.
The storyline of Resident Evil Village is a deliciously campy mix of Gothic literature, folklore, and B-movie horror. You'll encounter mysterious witches, hulking werewolves, and a certain tall lady who's captured the internet's attention for reasons we won't discuss here. It's a narrative that balances between genuinely creepy and downright hilarious, keeping you engaged while occasionally making you question the sanity of the developers.
The gameplay in Resident Evil Village is a heart-pounding rollercoaster of fear and action. The gunplay feels satisfyingly punchy, and the enemies are delightfully grotesque. Whether you're running for your life from a pack of werewolves or engaging in a tense boss battle, the adrenaline rush is real. And let's not forget inventory management, where organizing your herbs and shotgun shells becomes a strategic puzzle worthy of a Ph.D. in Tetris.
Speaking of puzzles, Resident Evil Village offers a mix of brain-teasing challenges that range from clever to ""seriously, who designed this?"" Some puzzles are brilliantly designed, requiring you to think outside the box and uncover hidden secrets. Others might leave you scratching your head, desperately trying to find the one obscure item you missed while accidentally throwing explosive barrels at yourself. But hey, it's all part of the fun!
Now, let's talk about the real star of the show: the larger-than-life characters. From the gruff but lovable protagonist Ethan Winters to the delightfully eccentric Duke, the cast of Resident Evil Village oozes personality. And, of course, we can't forget Lady Dimitrescu, the towering vampire queen who has become an internet sensation. She's tall, she's elegant, and she's the reason everyone's upgrading their monitors. Kudos to the developers for creating a character that has taken the world by storm.
While Resident Evil Village is a masterclass in horror and hilarity, it's not without its quirks. Some of the voice actings can be a little... let's just say ""charmingly wooden."" And there are a few moments where the game takes itself a bit too seriously, causing unintentional bursts of laughter. But hey, it's all part of the charm and adds to the game's unique flavor.
In summary, Resident Evil Village is a spooky, silly, and thoroughly entertaining experience that deserves high praise. It's a game that will make you jump, laugh, and possibly question your sanity. With its hauntingly beautiful visuals, engaging gameplay, and memorable characters, it's a must-play for horror aficionados and fans of the series. Just be prepared to embrace the scares and enjoy the hilariously eerie ride. With a rating of 9.6",1685744508,1685744508,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, the game is an amazing experience, especially on your first play through. It's a game where you can easily immerse yourself in with the main character, the first person is a nice benefit. However, this doesn't mean the game has no flaws so let's get the negative parts out of the way: 

[spoiler] The game has problems in terms of enemy scaling. On Village Of Shadows (The games hardest difficulties) I got softlocked at one point due to a lack of ammo. This caused to have to restart my entire game. To ensure it wasn't a verified ""skill issue"" I used a side mod to reveal enemy healthbars. After using every part of ammo in the arena, and buying as much as I could from Duke the boss was nowhere near dead. [/spoiler]

The game is too lenient on Action instead of Horror

The boss fights feel lacking at times. There was only one boss on [spoiler] Village Of Shadows [/spoiler] where I actually felt accomplished upon defeating them. I'm not sure if this is because I personally found the boss too easy, got extremely lucky with critical hits or just am an outright boring bitch lol.

In my lovely opinion, the [spoiler] Factory [/spoiler] part of the game felt rushed, almost like a filler to make up for something greater that was cut? [spoiler] Why didn't we get the option to team up with Karl Heisenberg? What happened to Ada Wong, as there were concept models for her to appear during the game. Why are they still insistent on hiding Ethan's Face, even though Capcom knows full-well we know what our monotone protagonist looks like. [/spoiler] 

And my biggest pet peeve, call me ""horny"" or whatever, but [spoiler] they killed off Lady Dimitrescu way, way too early. Angie + Donna should have been first, then you get a scene with Dommy Mommy. Then you kill Moreau, then finally the castle segment begins. Also, the castle was too short. For a massive fuck off castle you'd expect... more. I know the castle like the back of my hand, for something that grande I shouldn't be able to memorise a layout so easily. There also should have been traps. [/spoiler]

Ranting aside, let's talk about the games many perks: 

It's a fun playthrough. That's what's most important, right? 

You never feel too confused on where to go, and (for the most part) all enemies and bosses are balanced according to your difficulty. 

The Duke and his many wares are a great, welcome addition that adds to both the replayability, gameplay and even depth of the game. Love ya' my big boy. 

There's a 9'6 woman with booba. 

There's a fine variety in enemies and even weapons. Even certain enemies have evolved forms of themselves [spoiler] Such as Armoured Lycans [/spoiler] 

The story is immersive and easy to understand. [spoiler] Angry Dad looks for his daughter in a village full of bad people, finds Mother Miranda who is doing some Voo-Doo Shit with his daughter to revive her dead daughter.

this game being a direct sequel to RE7 my expectations were high, sadly this game wasn't as scary but its combat macanics made for a great experience. this game felt like a combination of RE4 and RE7, it had the first person elements and crafting macanics of RE7 and had the similar setting and merchant macanics to RE4

[h1]Ethan Winters, Welcome[/h1]

[u][b]Initial Impression:[/b][/u] After playing RE7 as my first resident evil game, I was hyped to play this one. Most of the time I am always dissapointed with sequels but not with this one. It takes the story to a whole new level. This time instead of playing in a house, you are exposed to outer world, which is a fresh take. All the characters are awesome and memorable with amazing boss fight. At the end, it connects all the dots to RE7 which is a huge plus point for me. The story is amazing and graphics are demanding (Played in 1080P Ultra settings consumed 7.2GB of VRAM :) but still the environment is damn gorgeous.
https://youtu.be/NfPiB_1ktGo
[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u] A lot less scarier than RE7, which I think is a good thing as most of the players will feel comfortable to play. It has some puzzles similar to RE7 and it was pretty easy to solve. I played in standard difficulty and died only 3times, so it is easily playable. Now I am replaying  with Hardcore difficulty. All the levels were neatly designed and the one thing which impressed me is that all boss fights were unique. Those of you who are new to resident evil games, I would prefer you to play RE7: Biohazard first as the storyline is connected. 

[u][b]Final Verdict:[/b][/u] It has a replayable value. Definitely a 9/10 for me. Would strongly recommend it. Added the DLCs to the wishlist, hope it turns out good as the RE7 DLCs :) Good job Capcom !!!

This is a sequel to RE7 as you once again play with Ethan, who's now settled in Europe in an attempt to start a new life with Mia and their new-born.

RE8 must be praised by its beautiful graphics and environments, but this is a PC port. Although well-optimized, some functions don't seem to work quite well on PC. When navigating in the menu, e.g., you must right-click the mouse in order to go back, instead of the usual ESC, which makes it a bit clumsy to navigate. Some graphical settings such as Anti-Aliasing seems inexistent. I'd recommend watching the Digital Foundry review for more info on that.

Once again, enemies are bullet-sponge. Headshots are not as effective and enemies also tend to dodge your bullets. Despite all that, they are not quite challenging (in the normal difficulty, at least). I haven't died once while in combat. I get way too many resources in this compared to RE2 remake. My ideal Resident Evil scenario would be having more enemies and taking more damage when hit while having fewer resources, but also getting rid of these bullshit headshots that aren't nearly instant kill and enemies miraculously embodying Neo from Matrix.",1685501320,1685501320,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

RE3 Remake was good, but butchered and short, RE4 Remake was great as well, and RE7 was good, but extremely short. (we can skip the remaining ones, because they're either not all that great or very hard to play (RE1 Remake, although that was kinda enjoyable as well, if not for the fucking doors!) today).

The 1st person camera does wonders here and the graphics are superb, while the game just ... works and runs without glitches, bugs or graphical issues at a solid frame rate.

Gameplay wise it's probably the most varied entry in the series as well, with 4 very different areas (and bosses), as well as a sort of ""hub"" you'll be returning to multiple times, but every time it's changed and you have more possibilities (hopefully).
Shooting is fine and the guns finally sound more like guns, instead of pea shooters like in RE7.
Puzzles aren't too difficult, but there's lots to explore and upgrade. All in all just solid. Just too bad, that there are once again no iron sights, but oh well.
And, again, unlike RE7 this game actually has some varied enemies!

Then there's the story ... and imho I think it's pretty good. A father is on a quest to save his daughter and has to fight evil forces! It fits the fairy tale intro (literally an animated children's horror story Mia reads to Rose) perfectly.
On this quest he meets a mysterious ally and an old acquaintance and, of course, all is not as it seems.
My only real gripe with the story is that it involves Mia. And I hate Mia with a passion. I let her die in RE7, but of course that's not the canon ending. I just can't fathom why Ethan would risk so much for an ego-centric bio-terrorist of all people. Or why the new Umbrella (not to be confused with Neo-Umbrella, I guess -.-) or the BSAA don't put her behind bars. Maybe I missed something, but as far as I'm aware she's the sole reason the whole debacle with Eveline and the Mutamycete even began, although it feels like they retconned a lot with the latter anyway ... or purposefully mislead people/didn't explain stuff.
Anyway, the Muta is back, baby... 
Ethan on the other hand is just a soft noodle and a blank slate, but I can forgive him for that. I can't forgive Mia though. That character should have died in RE7. Rose could have been already born by that time, held in an Umbrella lab, for instance. Or they could have ""created"" her with their genetic material later on. Fits the character better anyway imho, but we'll get to HER in the DLC review (Spoiler: It's not going to be positive).

If you want like 13 hours of fun horror gameplay (seriously, that 2nd level!) in a gorgeous game with solid mechanics, go get it. Beware though: Without having played RE7 you're missing big parts of the experience, even though there is a ""Baker Files"" recap video.",1685481723,1685481723,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The villains are quite fun, even when ignoring all the memes although I have to admit that Lady Dimitrescu has awakened things inside me I really don't want to talk about, and the environments can really look quite gorgeous, and the signature Resident Evil gameplay is here, with lots of items and secrets and puzzles strewn around the well-built levels and environment. That is all awesome. But for someone whose favourite Resident Evil game is unequivocally Resident Evil 7, Village is a step backwards in many aspects. Ethan was in 7 too, but he wasn't too bad as a protagonist, and even though he isn't as bad as some would make him out to be, he can still be unbelievably obnoxious at times, especially after everything he's already been through at this point. The story is nowhere near as tight and compelling either, and especially in the second half, all the cracks really start to show, quickly descending into the almost nonsensical. Another thing that was sadly sacrificed for a more expansive setting is the atmosphere, which was masterfully textured and layered in 7, every nook and cranny of the bayou oppressive and foreboding, fear lurking around every corner, which sadly resulted, at least for me, in Village feeling and playing like more of an action game rather than the unbelievably tense survival-horror experience that made Resident Evil 7 so Goddam incredible. Where 7 was about tension, and fear and atmosphere, Village opts for spectacle and throwing enemies at you. Mostly. The doll house chapter was superb, horrifying and tense and hitting all the right spots of paranoia, by far the best chapter in the game for me personally, and it just kinda soured the rest of the experience a bit, realising how different the whole experience could have looked. Now this sounds like I'm just crapping all over the game, but the truth is I actually had a lotta fun playing it, and I realise most people really loved it, and everything it sets out to accomplish it does accomplish more or less, this is more about personal taste rather than actual faults. I recommend Resident Evil Village, even if I vastly prefer 7, and I really hope Capcom goes back to the survival-horror experience I loved so much, in the next game.",1671364990,1685448839,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I like the story, I like the gameplay, I like the music and sound design, voice acted beautifully. All round a good game that just lacks a bit of focus.
I would say after Res 4/Remake and Res 2 Remake, this would be my third favourite.",1685370839,1685370839,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The gameplay as well as the loot system and the dealer are quite innovative and very entertaining and really make you want to loot all the zones. The card, which gives a price as to whether the room has been completely looted or not, is particularly helpful.

The story and the artistic direction are excellent. The game itself is very innovative and provides a real renewal. Although the game is easier than its predecessor, the exploration, zone unlocking, and puzzle systems are excellent. The DLCs are also successful and fun. The bonus shop with the expansions and benefits that can be unlocked and purchased through successes has also been implemented well.

In summary, it's one of the best Resident Evil games for me, especially in terms of gameplay. So I recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent survival horror with enough modernity and around 15-20 hours of gameplay.

I can definitely give the game a buy recommendation.",1685352715,1685352715,True,7,0,0.593094944953918457,0,True,False,False

3rd person view is a good change of phase for Ethan. Shadow of rose is a very good DLC to bad its SHORT AF. I wish the dlc would be longer. NOW mercenaries.... well its mehh in general week.
Ethan as a character is more emotional then in RE7 that was more like a board (with out emotions) here he shows his emotions to the fullest good actor.
Rest i won't spoil but i don't like how Chris played his role due to cut content sooo... BLAH.

Why to make it so difficult that either spend hours to find correct action sequence or look for the guide. Point me somebody who actually liked this part, not just walkthrough it!
Update: Finished main story on hardcore. Shortly - the battle with lycans without knowing exploits like [spoiler]shoot through barricade and nobody will appear from the back[/spoiler] and [spoiler]let's just wait in the underground floor of the building, lycans for whatever reason will not enter there for 2 minutes[/spoiler] is unpassable. So we have scripted, idiotic, bugged and poorly designed piece of shit right in the start of the game. I just cant get it.
Also during playing it is very noticable that difficulty curve is very strange. Dimitrecu daughters are much more dangerous than many bosses in the late game!
And also problems with difficulty levels - normal appears too easy, hardcore too tough.
Other aspects are great. Story, gameplay outside pointed above, graphics etc. - nice.
So what we have - great game, that was almost ruined with very strange decisions about difficulty in many game episodes. Sometime devs do not hesitate to make exploit and bug related gameplay. It is very... infantile, I'd say.
So I recommend this game with one remark: feel free to check youtube if you stuck in some part of the game and do not worry about ""I'm bad player"". It is obvious that dev didn't implement game difficulty aspect well for whatever reason.
P.S. Again update after ""Shadows of Rose"". Absolutely annoying gameplay that presumes only ONE correct way to play, and TEENAGER WHO CANNOT RUN EVEN FACING  DEATH? I don't give a shit that it is gameplay element. It is just absoulutely idiotic and annoying. I think it was the last game I bought in Resident Evil franchise.

But by far my favorite segment of this game is the beginning up until the last quarter of the game or so. That's whenever the survival horror element of the game is at its best. Classic puzzles, tense combat encounters, etc.. But this game isn't my ideal survival horror game. Unlike a game like Resident Evil 2, there isn't much emphasis on deciding what enemies to take out or leave. Even on the harder difficulties, you're pretty much expected to be able to kill everything you see. I would prefer a system where leaving enemies behind often makes sense and where killing an enemy is more of a strategic decision.

Rating: ★★★★☆

Resident Evil Village continues the iconic survival horror franchise with a chilling and atmospheric journey that is sure to keep fans on the edge of their seats. Developed by Capcom, this eighth installment in the series offers a captivating blend of intense combat, exploration, and a captivating narrative, making it a worthy addition to the Resident Evil universe.

The game's setting is a standout feature, as players find themselves in a mysterious and foreboding village that exudes a sense of unease and dread. The environments are beautifully rendered, from the decrepit old houses to the dark and haunting forests, with attention to detail that adds to the immersion. The game's atmospheric soundtrack further heightens the tension, perfectly complementing the eerie ambiance and jump scares.

Resident Evil Village brings back beloved protagonist Ethan Winters, as players navigate through a twisted narrative filled with supernatural elements, memorable characters, and mind-bending puzzles. The story successfully keeps players engaged, unveiling secrets and twists that will leave them guessing until the very end. While the plot may feel convoluted at times, it is a rollercoaster ride that fans of the series will appreciate.",1684960960,1684960960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having just left the events of Louisiana behind, his past comes back to haunt him once again. Once again, we experience the events unfold through The World's Best Father's eyes. if Resident Evil's 7 inspiration was the Original Resident Evil with its looping level design and focus on gore and horror then Resident Evil VILLAGE's inspiration was RE4. Throughout my playthrough I felt a sense of familiarity from its level design and gameplay, which was very welcome. It combines some of the best aspects of past games to create an overall great package: Persuers from past RE games, gameplay and level design from RE4 and a really nice story. If you've played RE7 (which I recommend you do if you haven't) you know what to expect. Memorable characters will haunt, torture and mock you as you traverse each of their twisted dungeons. I recommend turning aiming reticles off for a much more immersive experience. Family plays a very important role in the story and seeing Ethan overcome daunting obstacles in the name of love really moved me. I'm still in awe at how much I cared about Ethan, Rose and Mia.  Speaking of Rose, she gets her own DLC story which further strengthens the family bond. At first, she comes off as a bratty teenager going through an emo phase but by the end of it, I came to really like her and felt nothing but compassion towards her. This is one of the most heartfelt pieces of DLC I have ever played, When Rose reads a letter she finds, I started crying because of how sweet and heartwarming was. I'm happy and excited for the future of Resident Evil, hopefully we get to see Rose develop further as she deals with life and discovers who she's meant to be. 
NOTE: Please do note that you'll need the DLC in order to play in third person mode and access Rose's Story.  I'd advise waiting for a price drop to get both in the Gold edition. This goes for Mercenaries mode as well. Personally, even though the game was conceived with a FPS camera in mind, it plays and feels much better in Third Person mode. Not just that but it feels much more cohesive with the rest of the series and sidesteps headaches due to low (and unchangeable) FOV.",1676344584,1684692595,True,1,0,0.515738487243652344,0,True,False,False

Verily, it must be said that this endeavor hath not achieved the zenith of its predecessor's brilliance. However, in the realm of relative comparisons, it doth soar above the lamentable shortcomings of Resident Evil 7, thereby illuminating a glimmer of promise within its sprawling tapestry.

Within the vast expanse of this intricate creation, one finds oneself inexorably drawn into its dark embrace, ensnared by the intermingling threads of nostalgia and novelty. Its visual opulence, meticulously crafted and rendered with an attention to detail that borders on the ethereal, stands as a testament to the wondrous potential of contemporary graphical prowess. From the foreboding shadows that dance upon ancient corridors to the sinewy textures that breathe life into the uncanny inhabitants of this macabre realm, every pixel reverberates with a sense of foreboding and visual splendor.

Yet, it is not merely in its visual majesty that Village finds its potency, for the audial symphony that accompanies this harrowing journey is an orchestral marvel in its own right. The soundscape, a delicate fusion of haunting melodies, spine-chilling ambience, and bone-chilling sound effects, ensnares the senses in a vice-like grip, heightening the atmosphere of dread and trepidation. It is in this synergy of sight and sound that the true horror of this realm manifests, leaving an indelible imprint upon the very fabric of one's psyche.

Among the rogues and miscreants that populate this twisted landscape, a particular figure emerges with an air of resplendent magnetism. Heisenberg, a villain of enigmatic allure, exudes an aura of cool detachment that captivates the discerning eye. Clad in a sartorial elegance that befits his status, he commands attention and leaves an indelible impression upon the annals of gaming antagonists. His enigmatic presence, coupled with his formidable abilities, stands as a testament to the imaginative prowess of the game's designers.

As one delves deeper into the intricate web of Resident Evil Village, it becomes evident that the echoes of Resident Evil 4 reverberate throughout its corridors, seeking to rekindle the fire of adulation that once burned so brightly. Alas, despite its earnest endeavors, it falls short of replicating the transcendence of its forebear. The magic that made Resident Evil 4 a timeless masterpiece remains elusive, casting a shadow upon this valiant attempt to capture lightning in a bottle once more.

Nevertheless, it would be remiss to dismiss Resident Evil Village entirely, for within its flawed tapestry lie moments of undeniable enjoyment. The ebb and flow of gameplay, the heart-pounding encounters with grotesque abominations, and the spine-tingling exploration of its treacherous environs coalesce to form a compelling experience. It is in these fleeting instances of triumph and discovery that the game shines, pulling the player deeper into its haunting embrace.

In conclusion, while Resident Evil Village may fall short of the lofty standards set by its illustrious predecessor, it does possess a measure of merit that outshines the lamentable missteps of its immediate predecessor. As one traverses its winding corridors and grapples with its harrowing challenges, the visual splendor, haunting audial tapestry, and the charismatic allure of certain individuals within its nightmarish domain create a captivating experience that deserves recognition.

Starting with the graphics, Resident Evil 8: Village presents a visually captivating world. The game's realistic atmosphere, detailed character models, and environmental effects provide an immersive experience that completely engulfs you. The dark and eerie atmosphere of the village further emphasizes the game's horror elements.

In terms of gameplay mechanics, while staying true to the previous games in the Resident Evil series, Resident Evil 8: Village also introduces innovative elements. The series' characteristic features such as weapon inventory management, puzzles, and exploration are present in Village as well. However, the game offers a more fluid gameplay experience, striking a successful balance in terms of pacing. The combat mechanics are highly satisfying, and the enemy designs are truly chilling. The boss battles also provide an exciting and challenging experience.

The story connects intriguingly to the Resident Evil universe and immerses you in a thrilling adventure. Playing as Ethan Winters, who arrives at the village, players encounter a mysterious family and various creatures. As the story progresses, you uncover the deep secrets of the village and face events that heighten the suspense. The voice acting and performances of the main characters are also remarkably well-done.

Another significant aspect of Resident Evil 8: Village is its replayability. The game is packed with various difficulty levels and additional content. Additionally, by exploring different sections of the game, you can delve deeper into the story details. This provides players with a long-lasting experience.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 8: Village is a fantastic game that will satisfy horror and action enthusiasts.

There are a lot of different plot twists and a disclaimer: For you'll simps, Lady D isn't even in half the game. Also, this ain't really a spoiler since it's on all the game art and promo material but Chris Goatfield makes his return in this game honestly the best moments in the game were when he was one cut-scenes and when you played as him.

For those looking to continue deeper into the RE lore, this game will disappoint you. For those looking for a fun, unique, horror, action game, RE8 is great.

The pace continues the theme since RE4, where you begin in a seemingly unwinnable situation but then a cut-scene takes over and the game truly starts. From there it's a good mix of fighting, exploration, running, puzzles, etc. My only gripe is that, especially early on, the mini-boss battles come out of nowhere. Yes, that is a part of the dread, and is realistic, but also creates a trial-and-error feeling that is less immersive and more annoying. The weapons, custom parts, crafting, and meals add a nice layer while remaining simple, unlike many modern action games. 

All-in-all, I really enjoyed the game as a game. But to the writers - Resident Evil has been around for 30 years and had 6 main installments with a dozen side games. It's okay to tell a new story in the spirit of the game, without referring back to the original characters or plots. You won't upset any legacy fans and will gain many new ones. I groaned out loud when you learn that ****** ******* knew *******, that was painful and had little logic behind it.

Map is trash. Overworld has items but doesn't have completion indicators. Tons of missable paths that you can't return to just because you've chosen a wrong fork in the road and triggered a cutscene. Supremely unintuitive treasure placement - precious stones just stuck to random metal gantries with no map marker.

Encounter design is also bad. Mooks are fine, but boring because all they do is hiss and roar. Minibosses are hillariously bullet-spongy. Random tall dude with an axe has more HP than the story boss that is supposed to command him. Like, I can't overstate how ridiculous it feels to pump dozens of sniper shots into an enemy's head and then still need to use *multiple* explosives and shotgun blasts to bring it down. I can buy El Gigante needing that, but not just a tall humanoid. The fight with an enemy that creates a shitton of visual clutter on your screen, does a ton of damage and is invincible relies on you noticing a tiny lever which is obscured from the direction you enter the boss arena. Enemies have artificial traversal boundaries set, so you can abuse the AI by going one room too far away, then returning and shooting the enemy in the back, rinse repeat.

This game was an amazing experience

Is it fun: yes
Story: Amazing
Gameplay: Casual

The issue holding it back to me is how every boss fight besides the final one just feels like you have to shoot and walk backwards to win. There isn't much more to it after that.

The enemies also will sound like they're right next to you sometimes but they'll be up on the hill you already crossed.

Immersion: I got jumpscared...a lot... might've peed a little. 10/10

But I won't lie too my own view, this game cannot hold itself up too the standards of the originals. it shouldn't be a bad thing, but it doesn't even try getting close & that is bad. 

The story it wants too tell is confounding & inconsistent, the characters, that I do have some hope for, don't cut it, the hype was over the top (as usual it seems these days) & the idea of the RE engine for its graphic fidelity is in question too me (I played Resident Evil HD Remastered and it still looks more beautiful then anything i've seen in the past 5 years since the RE engine was first announced). 

I cannot force anyone's hand, but take my word for it. I do NOT Recommend this too a first timer of the series. it its a false representation of what the series is & too disagree is blinded by the hype. as for hardcore fans.... Idk if waiting for a sale too just have it in the collection is even worth it.

The graphics are phenomenal and the plot for the game to be played in an open and beautifully designed world is awesome. The enemies are more unique and had their own abilities and difficulties than RE7 or some other RE games. Exploring the village and the other places in it is so enjoying and the unique twist of having 4 Powerful Lords, Mother Miranda as the main villain and the Megamycete. The twist of this game connecting all the RE games to it as because the virus and the mold originated in the village is also cool and the rest is for you to find out. First person perspective is also nice yet still has some issues with it. Weapons, combat and fights are also well made and worth it. The merchant or the Duke is also really helpful and has more options. The boss fights are also amzing yet despite having more boss fights than RE7, It's also strangely a bit easy to beat. The puzzles are also unique and vary in different special ways but can be straightforward and easy to hint though.
The scares and horrors also are both terrifying and awesome, with unexpected jumpscares, adrenaline, and the horrorific aura while exploring, never knowing what, when, where or how it will happen. The idea of making this a survival horror game is nice yet overly focused. The depth and informations behind all characters are well described and shown here, especially for Ethan, Lady Dimitrescu, Mither Miranda and some but some are still missing and left for the next game or for us to find. The Mercenaries mode and the other gameplay modes is also coola nd even having the models of each character, items and enemies in the game which you can buy is also a good concept. The songs and soundtracks used are awesome and memorable, hits a new medley and original in their own way. The story concept for the intro and credits is also uniqye and I swear I got Coraline Vibes from it. The cutscenes and acts are really pretty amazing and oh, all the items, treasures, weapons and crafted products are all still goodly unique. Although this game has issue with its action movements, camera and some bigs in the game, it's still an awesome and legendary game for us.💖💖
The voice actors also did a great job and the story, plot and overall are amazingly good and memorable. I love it and recommend to all other gamers there.
hope you'll all enjoy this game as much as we do.
Have a nice day!!!😇😇💖💖",1684176055,1684176055,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

About the game, i have mixed feelings. On one side, it's a nice RE (although it lost -again- the horror factor that RE7 had brought), but i felt it TOO similar to RE4: first a village, then a castle, the acuatic monster, an industrial map, etc. The villains didn't felt too kind to RE (the ""monsters"" theme doesn't suit very well the universe) but at least their mutated forms were closer to what we already know. The story was a nice finish for what it started in RE7 (and a great explanation), and i'm thankful to have back the more classic Chris look. The game itself is really not that hard (the fact that you can finish it in 2 and a half hours with knife only is a big giveaway), but the Mercenaries was brutal. Taking count that it took me like 16/17 hours to finish the games 3 times, is well over my ability. I tried to get SSS in all of the maps (i know, is more that it is asked for in the achievements but i wanted the laser knife) but still failed on the last one. Probably will try to get it in the next couple of days, to see if i can finally finish it. 

EDIT: I just finished the DLC and even that it gave some more story to the Winters, it felt cheap and rushed. Only about two hours, i would have expected to be just a ""side story"" that would have been included in the main game (Like Separate Ways or Assigment Ada in the original RE4). The story goes way beyond the usual RE thing, even more than the main game, so thats not good. The new Mercenaries map are ok and the new characters and mechanics on it makes The Mercenaries a bit easier. The new achievements are nothing out of ordinary, you can get them in one go if you play the DLC on Hardcore. A bit dissapointed with the DLC. P.D: House Benaviento still the creepiest ""part"" of each story.
P.D:  Still don't know why Capcom keeps insisting in not showing Ethan's face. In the DLC felt ridiculous that in almost all shots his face is covered or seen from an angle/distance.

Still, recommended to play and be in tune with the story. A 6.5 out of 10 (i took half a point because of the poor DLC)",1660339228,1684119764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Me concernant, j'ai commencé la licence au 5  J'avais adoré Resident Evil 5 à l'époque sur Xbox 360, même si le Gameplay était particulier, et même ici l'ayant refais sur PC avec les DLC's, je continue à adorer ce jeu, et je vais le dire, c'est celui que je préfère de la Licence. 

Avant de vous parlez de ce Resident Evil Village, je me dois de vous donnez mon ressenti sur les différents Resident Evil auxquels j'ai pu jouer:

J'ai découvert Resident Evil 4 il y a quelques mois seulement sur PC, et personnellement, je ne comprends absolument pas son succès et pourquoi tout le monde considère que c'est UN des meilleurs de la Licence, les gens ont critiqué violemment RE5 car trop d'action et le côté Survival Horror a été délaissé, alors qu'entre nous, RE4 c'est la même chose mais à mon sens en pire. J'ai passé un mauvais moment sur le 4 car principalement je trouve les environnements franchement pas dingue (notamment la dernière partie sur l'Île qui est infâme), les Boss sont pas dingues non plus (excepté U-3 et le Verdugo que j'ai beaucoup aimé), les musiques sont pas marquantes quand tu les compares au 5... Bref, je n'aime pas le 4 et c'est UN des pires auquel j'ai pu jouer.

J'ai pu me faire récemment Resident Evil 6, et on ne va pas se mentir, c'est pas un Resident Evil, c'est un jeu d'action TPS, y a réellement la Campagne de Léon qui représente Resident Evil avec une ambiance angoissante et horreur, la Campagne de Chris est catastrophique (c'est Call of Duty), la Campagne de Sherry j'ai personnellement bien aimé (sauf le passage dans la Neige qu'est pas ouf) et la Campagne d'Ada je l'ai trouvé très moyenne. Bref, c'est un très mauvais RE mais un jeu d'action sympathique.

Concernant Resident Evil 2 Remake (je n'ai pas fais l'original), j'ai énormément apprécié le jeu, le seul défaut qui m'a franchement dérangé, c'est le backtracking (notamment t'as plus de place dans ton inventaire, donc il faut que tu retournes dans la pièce de Sauvegarde pour déposer ton stuff dans le Coffre), pour ma part, c'est un très bon Resident Evil. 

Pour Resident Evil 3 Remake, j'ai personnellement apprécié la partie de Jill mais j'ai détesté jouer en tant que Carlos (car une fois de plus, c'est du Call of Duty), et le Nemesis et ses 3 ou 4 affrontements sont bidons (sauf le 1er que j'ai plutôt apprécié), en conclusion, je n'ai pas aimé RE3 Remake (même si ce n'est pas une merde, mais c'est très très moyen).

Voilà, nous allons pouvoir passer à Resident Evil Village, je n'ai personnellement pas joué au 7.

Je vais commencé par les Qualités du jeu puis j'enchaînerai sur les Défauts du jeu:

Qualités:

Le Lore, c'est personnellement UNE des choses que j'ai le plus aimé dans le jeu , l'Univers à la Castlevania, le bestiaire (Lycans, ""Vampires"", Gargouilles... y compris la majorité des Boss à l'exception de Moreau), les Environnements proposés (le Village, le Château Dimitrescu, Maison Beneviento...)

- Son Ambiance, c'est lié aussi au Lore mais j'ai trouvé l'ambiance franchement génial, mention spéciale au Meilleur moment que j'ai pu vivre dans un Resident Evil tous jeux confondus de la Licence (passage Beneviento), ce passage est exceptionnel, ça respire du Resident Evil à l'état pur.

- L'Histoire, j'ai trouvé le Scénario plutôt intéressant, alors certes c'est tarabiscoté par moment (notamment sur la fin), mais je l'ai trouvé intéressant et plaisant à suivre.

- Les Graphismes + La Direction Artistique, le moteur RE Engine est magnifique (mais c'est pas étonnant, on a déjà pu voir ce moteur sur le 7 ou sur RE2 et RE3 Remake), les Textures sont très jolies et mention spéciale aux effets.

- L'Optimisation, elle est bonne, j'ai quelques chutes d'FPS de quelques millisecondes à certains moments bien précis mais c'est pas dérangeant, en revanche, le jeu consomme beaucoup de VRAM (j'en ai 12 et j'ai pas pu mettre au Max les Textures, le reste des Options Graphiques aucun souci).

- ""L'Exploration"", j'ai adoré me perdre dans ce Village ou dans les autres environnements afin de récupérer tous les Trésors ou à affronter les Boss Optionnels.

- La Bande Son, elle fait le taf, les doublages sont bons (notamment la VO mais la VF est bonne), les Musiques sont sympas mais beaucoup d'armes manque d'impact, c'est le petit reproche de cette bande son selon moi.

- La Durée de Vie + La Rejouabilité, j'ai terminé le jeu une première fois en 10 heures environ (en Hardcore et ce qui est bien), trop ça aurait été chiant (j'y reviendrai dans les Défauts), concernant la Rejouabilité, cela va dépendre de vous, vous débloquerez le Mode Mercenaire et puis vous débloquez la Boutique Spéciale ainsi que les Défis (qui vous donnent des Points pour acheter des Figurines, des Arts Works mais surtout acheter la possibilité d'avoir munition infinie sur l'arme que vous voulez, cependant vous devrez améliorer au maximum l'arme que vous voulez ce qui est très chère). J'ai refais le jeu 4 fois au dernier niveau de difficulté soit Village of Shadows puis j'ai joué au Mode Mercenaire un peu, j'ai donc terminé mon ""Aventure"" en 37 Heures environ.


Je vais désormais passer aux Défauts:

- Le Gameplay, il n'est pas mauvais, il est plaisant mais j'entends par là que dans les phases ou ça dégueule d'action, le gameplay n'est pas adapté car tu te fais défoncer et c'est bordélique.
- L'Effet Sacs à PV, c'est ce qui m'a le plus gonflé dans le jeu, tous les ennemis sont beaucoup trop résistants (en Hardcore, comptez 8-10 balles en Headshot sur un simple Lycan (même lorsque votre Pistolet est amélioré, en Village of Shadows j'en parle pas, c'est terrible), c'est la même chose pour les Boss (qui ont tendance à traîner en longueur à l'exception de Beneviento et Heisenberg).

- Le Game Design (notamment le Passage de l'Usine d'Heisenberg, je trouve cet environnement mal pensé, je m'y suis perdu plusieurs fois tellement c'est mal fait).

- La Progression du Jeu, j'entends par là que le jeu m'a fait rager à plusieurs moments et ça chauffe le chaud et le froid: 
 le début est catastrophique (où vous devez survivre à l'assaut des Lycans), c'est catastrophique car ici c'est Call of Duty mais t'as pas de balle donc tu peux rien faire. Ensuite, le passage au Château Dimitrescu est relativement bien (l'exploration), mais les Combats contre les Filles Dimitrescu et Dimitrescu elle même sont pas fou).
Le passage avec Beneviento est exceptionnel, je n'ai rien à redire.
Le passage avec Moreau est pas dingue du tout, l'environnement est très dégueulasse et n'est pas intéressant, et le combat contre Moreau est beaucoup trop long et n'est pas très palpitant.
Le passage de la Forteresse est d'une nullité affligeante, là sans rire, vous affrontez une soixantaines d'ennemis, c'est très mauvais car le Gameplay n'est pas du tout adapté à de l'Action pure contre des dizaines d'ennemis).
Idem pour l'Usine d'Heisenberg, environnement pas intéressant et bordélique avec beaucoup trop d'action, l'exploration reste cool et le combat contre Sturm et Heisenberg je les ai bien aimé).
Le passage avec vous savez qui je l'ai bien aimé mais c'est également du Call of Duty avec du Gears of War, ça dégueule d'action.
Et la dernière partie où l'on affronte le Boss Final est sympathique.


Pour conclure, j'ai passé un bon moment sur le jeu, j'ai quand même presque 40 heures mais honnêtement, il n'y aurait pas eu les Défis et le Mode Mercenaire, j'accorderai au jeu un 13-14/20, ici grâce à la rejouabilité et j'ai pu plus apprécié le jeu, je lui accorde un 15/20. C'est un Resident Evil que je trouve sympathique mais loin d'être incroyable, si vous aimez la Licence, je vous le conseil mais en promo, pas au prix fort.

15/20.

If you like old school linear games, this is def a game to get on sale. There are parts that are very well thought through and fun to play - especially when the horror / suspense element is in focus. What is really bad though is the dialogue, which feels less thought through than a 14 year old intern could produce. At times it even feels autogenerated by a large language model, stacking a bunch of cliche words together dont make a good story..I honestly think Id like the game better if theyd skip most of the dialogue.. Thank god the gameplay was good (apart from the boss fights - run to the side, shoot, run to the side, shoot, repeat).",1684059012,1684059012,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, I like when media goes full ridiculous just to see if it works, but I feel as though Resident Evil 9 might not be able to top this level of dumb without becoming something only a 10-year-old could enjoy. 

It comes right out of the gate with a ridiculous cast of baddies, each dumb in their own way. Internet Meme Dumb, Creepy Dumb, Gross Dumb, and Fedora Dumb, and their respective sequences get increasingly dumber as the game continues. I was somewhat shocked when I had to fight the equivalent of the Truckasaurus and the game wasn't over. And yes, it continues to get dumber, though I won't spoil it other than to say ""Michael Bay"". 

I mean, I guess I'm glad there's something this boldly dumb. I think I mostly hate it but I appreciate that it's here for diversity. I only fear Resident Evil 9 might enter the realm of the Banal Dumb. I don't want to feel *nothing* when I play it. I hope it gets a little more self-aware and throws in some fart jokes.

Resident Evil 8, oh how the mighty have fallen. As a long-time fan of the Resident Evil series, I can't help but feel a deep sense of disappointment with the direction the franchise has taken. While Resident Evil 7 was a masterclass in survival horror, its successor, Resident Evil 8, is a shadow of its former glory.

One of the biggest letdowns in Resident Evil 8 is the departure from the grounded and immersive atmosphere that made Resident Evil 7 such a standout title. Gone are the claustrophobic corridors and tense moments of suspense. Instead, we're thrown into a hodgepodge of supernatural elements, including werewolves, vampires, and even mythical creatures. It feels like the game has lost its identity, trying desperately to be something it's not.

Another glaring issue is the lack of cohesive storytelling. While Resident Evil 7 had a captivating narrative that kept players engaged and invested, Resident Evil 8 feels like a convoluted mess. The plot jumps from one bizarre scenario to another without any clear direction or purpose. It's as if the developers threw a bunch of horror tropes into a blender and hoped for the best. The result is a disjointed and confusing experience that fails to resonate with fans.

One of the strengths of Resident Evil 7 was its tight and focused gameplay. The first-person perspective added to the sense of vulnerability, forcing players to carefully navigate their surroundings and conserve resources. In contrast, Resident Evil 8 introduces a misguided attempt at action-oriented gameplay, sacrificing the tension and strategy that made the series so iconic. It feels like a generic shooter with no real substance or depth.

Additionally, the characters in Resident Evil 8 lack the depth and development we saw in its predecessor. Ethan Winters, the protagonist from Resident Evil 7, was a relatable and sympathetic character whose journey we cared about. In Resident Evil 8, he becomes a bland and forgettable vessel for the player, devoid of any personality or growth. The supporting cast suffers from similar issues, with shallow motivations and uninspired dialogue.

Lastly, the visual design in Resident Evil 8 is a step back from the impressive graphics of Resident Evil 7. While the game still has its moments of atmospheric beauty, the overall art direction feels uninspired and lacks the attention to detail that made its predecessor visually stunning. The environments lack the same level of intricacy and immersion, leaving players feeling detached and unengaged.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 8 fails to live up to the legacy established by its predecessor. It abandons the core elements that made Resident Evil 7 a masterpiece, opting instead for a scattered and inconsistent experience. The game loses its identity, sacrificing immersion, storytelling, and gameplay depth in favor of generic action and a mishmash of supernatural themes. It's a disheartening departure that tarnishes the reputation of the beloved franchise. Fans of Resident Evil deserve better than this lackluster and misguided entry.

-The levels are very linear and the answer to the puzzles are served to the player in a platter. 

-But, the game makes up for that by adding a variety of different enemies. They even experimented a bit by adding a traditional horror level to the game.

-If someone wants to try out the RE series, I'd probably recommend this game and then make them play RE4. So they understand what true level design actually is.

Como jogo em si é um belo jogo e divertido de se jogar. A coisa que mais me impressionou foi a batalha final. Achei maravilhosa.

Infelizmente nem tudo são flores. Se levar em conta que é um Resident Evil o jogo é uma catástrofe. 
- Áreas do jogo são como mundos diferentes. Cada Boss possui um ""mundo"" diferente de acordo com seus poderes. Isso quebra muito a imersão. Parece que a cada área estamos em um jogo diferente, ou seja, o jogo não tem alma. É um misturado de ideias.
- Os Boss possuem transformações sem noção. Novamente faz parecer um jogo de fantasia e não de terror.
- A ultima área, do Magneto, é terrivelmente chata. Pra piorar temos um dos Boss mais toscos da franquia. Aquilo é uma piada de mal gosto, superpoderes total!

1196590,137989993,76561199146571391,0,9,837,0,210,1698910267,"1. Defrost your steak (in less than an hour)

I’m not a great planner, so there are plenty of nights I’m in the mood for steak but the only steaks in the house are in the freezer. Not a problem. I fill a bowl of water (not warm) and place it on the counter and put the frozen steak (in its package) in the water for an hour. Sometimes I’ll change the water halfway through - and 60 minutes later my steak (or ground beef, or chicken breast) is thawed. Tip: There can be small holes in the cryovac plastic wrap so inspect your meat package before placing it in the bowl of water. 

Never defrost your steak in the microwave or on the kitchen counter - for food safety reasons.

2. Don’t cook a cold steak
To ensure the steaks cook evenly, it’s important to let your steak come to room temperature before cooking it (if you have time). You don’t need to wait until the meat is exactly 72 degrees. And you certainly don’t need to take its internal temperature with a meat thermometer. I usually try to leave my steaks out for an hour or so before cooking.

3. Pat your steaks dry before cooking
Before placing your meat on the grill or in a pan, pat them dry using paper towels. This is particularly important if the meat is seeping a bit of blood. One method I use is to place a stack of paper towels under the steak and another stack on top. Press down gently and pat down the sides of the meat. 

Drying the meat with a paper towel just before cooking will ensure good contact between the steak and the pan. If it’s not dry it won’t get crispy on the outside.

4. Don’t over-season your steak
I’ll admit it right off - the only seasoning I use on my steaks is salt. Salting is a crucial part of the seasoning process. Salt releases moisture in the muscle of the meat and releases the natural flavors of steak. I season my steaks with kosher salt just as I put them in the pan - but some chefs suggest adding the salt right after you take the meat out of the refrigerator. I don’t think that matters a whole lot - but whatever you do, don’t wait to season until you’re serving.

Even top steakhouse chefs limit their seasoning to salt, black pepper and, perhaps, garlic. You want to let the wonderful flavor of the steak be the star.

5. Use the right cooking oil
I was doing this one wrong until very recently! I was using olive oil but it was always smoking. I discovered that’s because it has a low smoke point (300 degrees). The best oils for cooking steak are avocado oil, soybean oil, and canola oil - all of them have a high smoke point between 400 and 520 degrees. Another alternative is clarified butter - with a smoke point of 450 degrees. 

6. Use the right pan and make sure it is very hot
These days, many steakhouse chains  use infrared broilers with their steaks to ensure extremely high temperatures and even heat distribution. Unfortunately, most of us don't have the luxury of such kitchen gear at home. I recommend using cast iron skillets  because they hold heat, which ensures the right sear and caramelization. Since cast iron is a dense metal, it also ensures even heat distribution. This, in turn, translates to evenly cooked and browned steak. No matter what, insure your skillet is very hot, but not smoking.

7. Don’t worry about how often you flip your steak
You’ve probably heard that you shouldn’t flip your steak too often. I’ve read up on this and it seems top chefs say not to worry about it - and, in fact, flipping it often might improve the final result (because it will cook more evenly through the center).

8. Don’t overcook your steak
My daughter recently told me she was nervous about cooking some Ribeyes and I reassured her there was only one really bad thing she could do - she could overcook it.

It can be tricky - This is because how fast your steak cooks depends on the thickness of the cut and the temperature of the grill or skillet. Sure, you can cut into the steak to check whether it's ready but I don’t recommend doing that since it lets out the juices.

I use a meat thermometer - always. Available in either digital or analog versions, meat thermometers are inserted into the center of the meat to gauge its internal temperature. In the case of a medium-rare steak, this should be around 125-130 degrees Fahrenheit. However, because the steak will continue to cook on the plate, it should be removed from the source of heat when it's 5 degrees Fahrenheit lower than the desired temperature.

9. Let the steak rest before serving
When you prepare a steak on a scorching hot skillet or grill, you're forming a crust that locks in moisture. If you cut into your steak right after it's removed from heat, you risk losing all these wonderful juices. Thin steaks should rest between five and seven minutes, while thicker cuts of meat should sit out on the plate for at least 10 minutes. You can even use a meat thermometer to check if your steak is sufficiently rested. No matter how thin or thick the steak, ideally you want its center to cool down to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

10. Cut against the grain and serve on a warm plate
How you present a steak can have a huge impact not just on its visual appeal but also on its flavor and texture. If you want to cut the meat prior to serving, always cut against the grain or perpendicular to the direction of the muscle fibers. Since muscle fibers can be on the tough side, slicing through them will make the beef more tender. Slicing along the muscle fibers, on the other hand, will have the opposite effect, making the steak chewier.

Another trick to elevating your home dining experience is by warming the plate prior to serving. This is because a warm plate helps to maintain an even temperature of the food while a cold one absorbs its heat, which could translate to a lukewarm steak. One of the best ways to warm your plates is by stacking them in the oven set at a low temperature or by placing them on the stovetop burner.

Firstly, the visuals are absolutely stunning. The graphics are incredibly detailed, and the environments are beautifully designed, from the eerie village to the Gothic castle. The sound design is equally impressive, with spine-chilling sound effects and a hauntingly atmospheric score that perfectly complements the horror experience.

The gameplay perfectly blends classic Resident Evil survival horror and new gameplay mechanics. The exploration and puzzle-solving elements are challenging and engaging, while the combat is fast-paced and intense. The variety of enemies is impressive, and each presents a unique challenge, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting.

The story is well-written and captivating, with plenty of twists and turns to keep me engaged from start to finish. The characters are well-developed, and Lady Dimitrescu quickly became one of my favorite video game villains.

My only complaint is that the game is relatively short but still packed with content and offers a high replay value. Overall, Resident Evil Village is an outstanding horror game and a must-play for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike.

The series has had dynamic shifts since its original releases, from camera angle to genre shifts. While Resident Evil 7 was an entirely new package with lots to explore and get scared for, its promising first act leaves the finale less than desirable. With this newest installment, I was excited as to how the game would play out. At first glance, there was immediately an emphasis on more open world and a particularly dashing vampire mother. The trailers built up major hype, and I was more than ready for the release. After playing, I'm sad to say a lot of the hyped aspects of the games such as the castle and horror fall flat. Almost pathetic puzzles ruin any sort of brain usage, and the ammo and health crafting is completely foreign in comparison to its horror SURVIVAL label as a game. That being said, it's hard to fault the story, considering this is Resident Evil, but my main complaint I still hold is how Chris was butchered. The writers forced things that left me confused and angry. In terms of strength, this game still has many. MOST of the bosses are cool and their fights enjoyable. A large weapon variety builds on that Resident Evil 4 feeling of being an action hero in a desolate battlefield. Enemies are engaging and mostly well designed. The horror aspect is there, especially in the factory. I genuinely felt fear for the first time in a long time from a game. Exploration, while limited, is rewarding and fun. The game runs vert smoothly with beautiful graphics. Witty banter is exchanged between the Duke and Ethan, which lightens rather dark moments. But that brings me to Ethan. As much as I ignored his dry attitude in the last game, I simply can't help being pulled out of the thrill by his empty remarks. He simply cannot shut his mouth during awesome parts of this game, immediately ending any immersion. Overall, I'd say new players will enjoy quite a bit, while returning players may feel it to be repetitive and nuanced. 8.5/10.",1683435791,1683435791,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is rich and attentive. Combat feels very satisfying. Lore is interesting to read. Map is a labyrinth, love it.
It is one of those games that you buy because it has Denuvo and won't be available to pirate anytime soon, but you don't regret buying it because of how good it is, and you flaunt it to your friends who are waiting on the piracy.

Not as good as its predecessor Biohazard 7 or the recent remakes Resident Evil 2, 3, and 4. 

My advice to you is to play Biohazard 7 first, since Resident Evil Village is the continuation of the story and has somewhat similar gameplay. If you like Biohazard 7, you will also like this sequel. 

Keep in mind that Village has more action and is less survival horror. The puzzles aren't challenging and you'll have plenty of ammunition. It's not as scary either. The boss fight are a bit bland and could be improved. 

Glad the story of Ethan Winters comes to an end in this opus as he is not the best protagonist in the series. Other characters from the franchise are much more charismatic and lovable.

This game is more horror and intense, but also not. My advice would be : ignore certain story points. The story is weakness and strength. On one hand it has intense moments that let you feel the horror and on the other you think the protagonist has severe brain damage and needs a doctor or a severe blow to the head. Another thing is certain NPC and the PC are ""over acted"" in their voice, and it feels cheap and/or annoying but other times and sounds amazing, and you can hear the emotions clearly.

Gameplay wise there are some good points: the look and the atmosphere, but sadly the shooting feels not good. The problem goes for the whole fighting system. As if the game was designed at the base without fighting and the fighting added later. It is clunky, slow, unresponsive. BUT at some points the fighting feels right (certain bosses). As if the game knew ""Oh Lord, he/she will ALT+F4 any moment I need something to keep him/her on the game"" and throws a good moment or boss at you. 

As you can see there is a pattern of ""boring and/or annoying"" and ""cool, give me more"" that repeats until the end of the game. For me it was enough to carry on.

TLDR or short verdict:
The Story is badly written, with sometimes good dialog and ideas surrounded by boring clutter. The optic and atmosphere is most of the time great. The performance is okay, but sometimes there are some FPS drops, but only for a moment (at least for me). 

So all in all a solid experience 6.5 out of 10.
(For reference, a good game begins at 8 and a bad is below 4, ergo everything between ""above 4"" and ""below 8"" is a solid experience with some drawback)

If you like easy horror with intense moments and can ignore a boring story and sometimes bad game loop? Go buy it. All other people wait for a sale.",1683303551,1683303551,False,0,0,0.451650261878967285,0,True,False,False

I've played a few hours of RE7 and it's not necessarily a bad game, it's just not what I'd call a Resident Evil game and neither is this. RE to me is about observing your surroundings to collect things and figure out puzzles with limited ammo and a poorly written yet somehow still entertaining story. 

In 7 and 8, observing your surroundings doesn't matter much. There are areas where things are and the rest of the world doesn't have anything. There's WAY too little ammo and they basically turned the combat into a puzzle because of that. I loved RE1 which had rare ammo but even still, the game wasn't about killing, it was about the overall puzzle with killing sprinkled in. RE4 was about killing but it had enough ammo to make that fun. RE8 is about killing but lacks the ammo to make it fun.

Its review score says I'm clearly in the minority but I'm not a fan and I'm glad for refunds :)",1683140541,1683140541,False,0,0,0.458015263080596924,2,True,False,False

Some people say RE4 had too much action and it left the horror behind and I only agree with them a little bit, RE4 was plenty scary for me but it was full of satisfying action as well.
That's Village for me all over again, the game scared me a ton, had me going through hectic sections and other wild stuff. Sometimes scary sometimes not, but always an incredibly fun game that has a LOT in common with RE4, in the best ways.
Inventory is fun to play with, awesome characters are in the world and it's really fun interacting with the shop.
This game is a huge W.

The DLC felt very by the numbers and it's EXTREMELY short, so I'd say to hard pass on the DLC in general. If you're a huge fan of the character Rose then the DLC will be enticing for you but otherwise I strongly suggest waiting for a big sale... even at 50% off I would consider the price of the DLC ""decent""

tl;dr game has as much horror/action as RE4, feels a lot like RE4 except first person view. It's so freaking fun yoooo like for real, it's a huge W ... DLC isn't worth full price due mostly to length and slightly to quality.",1683092152,1683092208,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1 tip I'd like to share is, try to save your ammo and health as much as you can. You won't be getting ammo and ingredients to make it much in game, so use it wisely.
Before starting this game, I'd recommend to watch some tips and tricks of this game on YT, it'll help you a lot, especially those part of game where you can't free-roam again.

You always know where to go next, while you are also encouraged to explore and find secrets. You never have to backtrack, unless there is something waiting for you along the way, and you revisit a lot of places for a sense of nostalgia throughout the game. There is a kind of hub area as well, that you come back to fairly frequently, and throughout the game you unlock new paths around the village so that exploring becomes easier. I'm a sucker for good level design and this game just does it perfectly.

Combat is really fun as well, especially because you can explode the heads of certain enemies, which is really satisfying. Enemies also react to where you shoot them, so you can develop your own strategies against different enemies, depending on how you want to play or if maybe, you're short on ammo.

The pacing of the game is great as well. Areas usually start off a bit slow and ramp up until a climax where you can have some peace of mind, before either continuing that sense of serenity to give you an opportunity to enjoy the environment or give you a hint that the worst is yet to come. Some areas show this type of curve through combat, where you kill a few smaller enemies, then some larger ones or greater numbers, leading into a bigger fight later. Other areas contain no combat, but play more into fear and panic to give the same sort of tension.

In terms of gameplay elements, there are only a few (seeing as it is an first person horror game, that shouldn't come as a surprise). You shoot enemies with your weapons, explore to find resources and valuables, which you can use to upgrade your weapons. For me, this type of gameplay loop is a big hit. It's simple and to the point, but every element of it has been mastered. Exploring is really fun, killing enemies is really fun, and getting upgrades makes you feel powerful, which, you guessed it, is really fun.

The story is a give or take. The very short version of the story is that your daughter is kidnapped and you have to go through five lords in order to get her back. Of course, there is much more to it, most of which you have to read in files that you find throughout the game. Either you like it or you don't, I won't say much more about it.

I can't exactly explain why, but the game has incredible replayability value. I've replayed the story around 15 times and I still think I'll play it again. Worth every last penny.",1682961057,1682961057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I probably haven't got much to say that hasn't been said already, but the game is fantastic.

Graphics are amazing indoors but outdoors it suffers a little, making terrain and nature look very weird and unrealistic sometimes. Sound design is very well done. Gameplay and controls? As you would expect of the RE franchise. Nothing new really, but it's very well done.

Level and game design are also great, innovating on each area whilst unlocking treasures in old ones. Progression and objectives are clear, there are no tedious sections or puzzles and I really value that. The game is way more action-based than RE7 losing a bit of the puzzle aspect of the previous one; whether that's good or bad is up to you. There's one area in particular in which the game turns into a survival, but other than that, you'll probably have a good stock of ammunition throughout your playthrough.

I loved the story. In fact, RE8 is one of those games in which I even read all the documents I found scattered throughout the game. It's well integrated and brings new perspective to the old games as well.

Content-wise, again, it's as expected of a RE game. You have your relatively ""short"" campaign that you can replay with many unlockables after you beat it the first time. It took me eight and a half hours according to the game's stats. There's some DLC which I won't get but I'll definitely watch the Rose one on YouTube.

And finally, of course, I had a lot of fun playing this. To put it into perspective, in 2021 I gave RE7 an 8.2/10, in 2022 I gave RE2 an 8.9/10 and RE3 an 8.6/10 and now, in 2023 I give RE8 a 9/10. 

Right now, my GOTY of 2023.

The Baron however is an incredible character and a few of the survivors you meet early on are believable and interesting.  In terms of the story the series jumped the shark long ago so every installment stretches things even further at this point. If you stop to think about the plot at all things immediately start to fall apart and make little to no sense but if i'm being honest i'm not here for plot or character design. This is a Resident Evil game. The characters are rarely interesting. The stories stopped being good a long time ago and i'm here for the gameplay and atmosphere.  I'll start by addressing atmosphere. The good news is RE8 has a incredible atmosphere. The environments are visually stunning and distinctly Resident Evil.  It doesn't do anything exceptional with environmental story telling, but you can expect to find a few interesting documents and letters to read throughout the campaign that add to the world building of the universe and aren't that bad but nothing like what's found in early installments. Overall i will say the world i wonderful to live in with a brilliant gothic atmosphere and captivating scenery. Now I saved what i consider most important for last which is the gameplay and I am happy to report the moment to moment gameplay is lots of fun. Continuing in the footsteps of RE7 this installment is first person but takes ques from RE4 in the speed and pacing of the gameplay. This game is a massive improvement over the gameplay in RE7.  You move faster, there is more enemy variety, the story and campaign moves at a very nice pace all things that Capcom from the feedback they got with 7 and it really shows. However the addition of enemies dropping ammo and lots of heavy firepower really take it more towards that RE4 Action Horror genre and away from that traditional RE Survival Horror genre that I do much prefer but honestly both are great.",1625648016,1682957249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It plays more like Resident Evil 4, which would've been nice to hint at the start. Instead, they drop the player into an arena with 20+ zombies and a giant final boss at the start of the game. Otherwise, gameplay was rewarding and satisfying, but not as majestic as Resident Evil 2.

The story on the other hand, though I was hesitant at first, ended up proving itself and took the Resident Evil world to a new level. Representing the dark side of the Promethean and Faustian ideals of human progression. In Resident Evil Village, we begin seeing much more complex bio weapons that are becoming more associated with human evolution. The story in this game, is my favorite in any of the Resident Evil games as it establishes more world building; instead of virus = x, stop y from using x, the end.

My son got this game for Festivus in 2021 from his uncle Frank, so we installed it on his Macintosh and he started playing. By the end of the first day he had 29 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends playing bum darts or just watching Xhamster. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died in a hot noodle accident. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside of our bunker.

Pros: I'm running this on two 3080 RTX's with 15 gigs of ram on a 10 year old motherboard and was able to play in ray tracing mode with no loss in frame rate or loss in performance. 
The first play-through was in Hardcore Mode and felt well balanced, forcing you to be conservative with ammo and strategically combining items according to whatever dilemma you're in. Like a true survival horror, you always had barely enough to push forward even after missing a few shots. 
This game has near photo-realistic graphics. The level and sound design are absolutely terrifying and kept me on edge even after enemies have been cleared out - especially Heisenberg's factory and the cellars/dungeons throughout the game.  
Loot, treasures, and puzzles are actually worth trekking back for - often with a few surprises along the way so you never let your guard down. Also, that lock pick you've been anticipating for a few hours might actually open something worthwhile and not like 3 fucking hand gun bullets as in RE 7. 
Also, unlike its predecessor, this game actually has enemy variety.
Cons:
The latency after hitting space bar to block feels unresponsive and can be extremely frustrating when anticipating an attack you see coming. Even more frustrating is when swarmed on all sides and Ethan is moving like a sloth with a load in his pants, getting stuck on boxes, railings, and what not.  On that same note, the game sometimes confuses the player with obnoxious camera rattling, noise, and other vision obscuring screen overlays - this is often in combination with cut scenes where you're not sure if you're actually playing or not. In short, it feels like they're breaking the ""fourth wall"" to effectively cheat the player in the name of immersion. 
Also, historically RE games would give you some kind of warning before perma-leaving an area - like RE 2 before departing on the train - but this was left out  in this installment, so even if you're persistent in finding everything you may have to reload previous saves (something to keep in mind in Luiza's house before the chaotic cut scene or opening the sarcophagus after finding all the masks in Castle Dimitrescu).
Overall, I would recommend. This game is well-polished and an absolute trip.",1682020398,1682696325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think this game has a very nice aesthetic, and it really draws you into its world. But the more you play I feel the worse it gets. For a Resident Evil game the puzzles were very simple, and this game has practically no reason to return to older areas. It plays very linear which I feel is out of place for a Resident Evil game. Every time I faced an enemy I was more frustrated than worried, because if I died I would lose all the progress I made in the last 10-15 min because of the poor checkpoints and auto saves. 

This game's story is also very bad, it has horrible pacing and I lost all interest after the first hour or so of playing, and the plot twist I feel just made everything that much worse. 

Like I stated earlier, this game is not bad. But compared to what came before (RE7) I think this is a huge step down in quality.

Resident Evil is at its absolute BEST when it is pure ""survival horror"" the genre it created. Look at RE1, 4, and 7, widely considered the best 3 in the franchise. However I do appreciate a lot about Village, the setting is still super cool, even though I think there should've been more focus on the castle (Lady D died too soon), the skippable cutscenes make subsequent playthroughs much better, the variety of guns (even though I like how the guns feel better in 7) and the dollhouse is the most TERRIFYING experience in any game I've ever had, hands down.

Anyway the main story is amazing, shadows of rose DLC is a must play or atleast watch it in youtube its amazing. 

Anyway the team did really good job on this game except for few things :
1. Stop forcing players have red screen and blood effects on screen, I do game screenshots had to use mods to get rid of that garbage or be full hp always.
2. Using photo made capcom made to have garbage written trademark watermark (remove that with mods) also bad idea.
3. Removed resident evil 7 option for auto crosshair remove when not aiming instantly. 
4. Also added skip button to cutscenes (that ruins screenshots making)  also removed it with mods, thank you modders.
5. Capcom started treating their players stupid or something, puzzles are easy for the most part, and really capcom ? yellow duct tape ?

Cinematics can be out of sync with the voices. The keybinding is like no game I've seen before, just like if the person setting it up never used a computer before and to the point I'm surprised WASD is actually used to move -> quick healing is CTRL, cancel/escape is right-click, V is map, crouch is right next to turn-around, hitting run while crouching make you stand up, you can't activate blocking if you aim, game ask no confirmation to use your components whenever you click a recipee to check it out or even by accident, and way more,

The game has no real tutorial, you're travelling from cinematic to cinematic for the first hour instead, the story make absolutly no sense, and do not tie together in any way shape or form. You're then forced to flee enemies for over 5 minutes without the game giving you any hint that is what they intend you to do, so prepare yourself to die over and over and over until you ran away a certain amount of time and find the exact right spot for the next cinematic to occur as there are infinite enemies (they go Dark Soul on your ass). You're then spared for the stupidest reason (actually an easter egg referencing RE4, the bell rang you see?). Then, you encounter NPCs with absolutly no sanity, the story make even less sense, only to make less and less sense as you progress.

This game is closer to a fantastic-horror fairytell than a Resident Evil, from which it only borrow the name, and that twice by taking over Chris Redfield and the protagonist of RE7 and doing an intro ""linking it together"", when in actuality it doesn't matter at all, doesn't relate to it, and would make MORE SENSE if they didn't tried to. It is sad nowadays companies fear that their game will not be ""as popular"" if they do not borrow names from established franchise, because it would be a good game on it's own storywise, but as a Resident Evil, it is a senseless shame that doesn't build into the world nor lore of RE. The only way it would make any sense lore-wise, is if the protagonist wake up and it was all just a dream, and THAT tells it all. It totally feel like somebody had a great idea for a game, and the company told him to use the RE name on it, and forced him to do something to make it seem it was supposed to be related while it definitely was not.

To summarize : The game style and lore can't integrate into the RE series. Some features that try to make this ""RE"" relate to others are just half-assed gimmicks. The story make no sense. The controls are terrible. The graphics are terrific at the expense of player accessibility. There is way too much cinematics and character interaction animations for no real good reason other than to amaze people, and that ultimately end-up making you feel the loss of character control as well as a loss of imertion (sit back and watch the movie rather than actually play a game). Level design is not good at directing you nor building up intrigue, only tension. The game doesn't introduce you properly to any of its mechanics. It takes way too much time before you can ACTUALLY start to really play the game and not run from cinematic to cinematic, but that will still happen ALOT throughout the whole game.

My advice? Remove the entirety of introduction, stop pretending it is Resident Evil, make your own characters with more defined personnality traits other than being the ""victims of RE7"", properly map the controls, rework the tutorial, and BOOM, it become a 9/10 with the only flaw being WAY too much cinematics and not enough gameplay. As a Resident Evil though... I'd give it 6/10, and story-wise, a 3/10, best way to enjoy it is to turn your brain off and forget the name along with any expectation coming from it.",1682340695,1682363437,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

edit: I've since beaten the game (casually it took me about 9 hours on standard difficulty with unlimited ammo) and it is still a fun game to play and the story was enjoyable. It made sense of some things that'd make you go 'why did this happen?' and tied in to the other older games in the series in an interesting way that I enjoyed. I'd say my only real complaints was that the factory segment was perhaps the weakest in terms of the aesthetic vibe the game had and the monsters were were kind of lame and more tedious than anything to deal with. And the segment where your perspective shifts I also found a bit tedious as it feels like it throws enemies at you for the sake of it because you naturally get a lot of ammo in that part and its hard to get breathing room for one part. Overall though, fun from start to finish and Ethan Winters wins best dad award.

I've gone on a weird journey with the series, playing the games out of order for the most part with starting at RE2R, then 3R, the previously mentioned playthrough on my ps4 of this game, part or RE6, Revelations and RE4R on console which started as me trying to get over scares and play more scary games in the process. I'm still a long way from that goal as I am still a big baby but at least I get to play good games in the meantime. 

Atmosphere and aesthetics-wise this game is really strong with cool monster designs and vistas that are pleasing to the eyes with each having a different vibe to invoke a feeling from you. Sound and music is also very good with voice work also being stellar as well along with the moment to moment gunplay also being an enjoyable experience. The puzzles for the most part are fairly easy and give enough hints about how you are supposed to accomplish them. Story is also enjoyable and while this is a direct sequel to 7, they do have a cutscene that you can watch to summarize the events of the game for those who didn't play it (like me but I watched lets plays of 7 before so I knew the story in sweeps) to not feel totally lost. The few things that are sort of annoying to deal with are some of the button keybinds are sort of weird and in the menu if the mouse is at a certain point and you are trying to scroll with the wheel, the menu will snap back to where your mouse is so you sort of pingpong in the menu briefly. Also if you're someone who wants to be chased all game by big mommy vampire, she's the first major boss of the game which means she won't be around for the majority of the game so get your jollies in as much as you can in the castle before she's gone.

Disclaimer: I bought the dlc which unlocks infinite ammo/special weapons at the jump since I am a bad at ammo management especially when I am scared and even with them boss fights and other fights still take a hot minute and the risk of death is still present in moment to moment gameplay. When I first played this partly on my ps4 it was before the dlc came out and I beat the castle and house segments with ammo management intact so I still partly experienced it.",1681850626,1682281931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cutscene , 3 meters walking, cutscene,  again a few steps, cutscene, cutscene, cutscene , shoot a few times, 
cutscene my аss! 
moreover : walking feels clumsy.
jumping is not allowed anyway. 
all characters so far dull. 
the vixen  Elena wants to, when the house is on fire, rather whine all over my ears? that's when i get aggressive and would like to hit this dump Вitch. 
well, cutscene just skipped and she was gone. thats good.
but then continue to walk slowly, as in the mud to the next fuсked cutscene.

It takes a while before it gets going, but then it throws you into a middle of an awesome castle level. Soon enough it transitions into a non-combat horror section that will scare the pants off of most players, just to then transition into a weird, setpiece-driven water level. By this point you start to realize that you haven't really had many opportunities to shoot monsters because the games sprinkles the encounters very conservatively. ""Village"" seems to take note, because it then throws you into a long combat-heavy section, and does not let up the pace until the end. What I'm saying is that it's a rollercoaster, and that's good. Some sections are boring and overdone though, especially late in the game, which is not great, but only really becomes grating during subsequent playthroughs. Still, ""Village"" kind of lost me in the third act, not because it cranked up the absurdity, but because it felt more dumb than fun. The plot is the weakest link of this game, and that's including Ethan Winters, the unfortunately-not-silent protagonist. It's clear that Capcom was going for ""Resident Evil 4""-type vibe, but the combat feel is too close to the slow survival horror entries and does not allow for enough creativity.

This game is just plain fun and challenging.  Completing the story the first time is only the beginning.  Your second and eventual other play-through is what make this game more satisfying.  Returning to The Village back again was also very fun and satisfying.  Worth the money and time spent in future plays.  A great addition to the convoluted RE story and timeline.

Btw this game is a direct sequel to RE7 but it loosely references it so it's easy to just play this one but I tell you that u SHOULD play the 7...

It also focuses more on action than horror compare to 7 but still filled with scary stuff...

Also the extra stuffs like the Mercenaries mode , Shadow of Rose DLC , extra weapons which you earn by playing the game and the fucking THIRD PERSON MODE like holy shit I can't believe they fucing add it in to the game...
Hope they also add 3rd person mode in 7...

On top of that the story and especially the writing can be quite cringe inducing. I know Resi never had truly great stories or writing as I played almost all of them (except for the the Outbreak games, other online games and the light gun games), but the issue is that in older titles (definitely up till part 4, maybe even 5 or 6...) the acting was also so campy and things usually were just overall so ridiculous that you couldn't take it seriously for a minute anyway - it actually added a fantastic trashy flavor to the games. However, since Resi 7 the acting actually ""improved"" to a point that you actually feel inclined to take things seriously from time to time (I did at least) and then the writing and dialogue just hits you... Also, Ethan is boring and a wuss and I just never liked him or Mia - it was still bearable in 7, but here it was too much for me. Hopefully, we'll never see them again...

I initially wanted to finish RE7 first to play them through in proper order but I was extremely disappointed in RE7 for various gameplay related seasons that I abandoned that game after about 2 1/2 hours. RE7 disappointed me so much that I was even hesitant to try RE8. I'm glad that I decided to give the game a chance though as I actually had a pretty good time with the game.

In many aspects it feels very similar to what RE4 did years ago. You have a somewhat similar inventory. Enemies drop loot that you can use to buy and upgrade stuff and even the whole atmosphere of the village is very similar to what RE4 did from what I remember. The movement and overall combat of RE8 is faster than in RE7. It actually looks and feels like you're running. The game also switches the focus from time to time. Some sections are more action oriented while others are designed to be creepy horror. The game sometimes uses jump scares but it's rare. My favorite section is a part where there isn't even any combat. It's just pure constant tension buildup where things get crazier and crazier while it then ends with a pretty satisfying finale and gives you some room to breath afterwards.

The overall story is coherant and servicable but unfortunately also has some problems. I can't really get into it without spoiling to much. I'm just gonna say that I would've handled some sections and character interactions differently as at least one character is a bit wasted within the story even though there's a cool boss fight. RE8 also has quite a few puzzles, most of which are easy or at least reasonable in terms of difficulty. There were one or two puzzles that left me scratching my head looking for a guide though. In addition there are quite a few hidding items. There have been a few rooms in my playthrough that still indicated something was there but I couldn't find it.

There are some parts I don't like in RE Village. The heavy use of video sequences in some parts of the game can be pretty annoying as it constantly takes away control from me as a player and there is no indication that you might run into a extensive video sequence. You open a door and *bam* you're watching a movie for the next few minutes...

Also there heavily scripted events as well. In one situation Ethan ends up in a cave with a deathly trap while being shackled. After dying the first time because I had no idea what to do I though about using the trap to unshackle myself. So I went closer to the trap and then ended up dying again because this was not the right solution. What the game expected me to do was crawl into a specifically prepared corner of the room that left a bit of space so I wouldn't be killed by the trap and then the game did for me what I wanted to do before with the shackles. I feel cheated in these kind of situations as I would like to figure something like this out on my own and actually do it myself instead of just watching a movie sequence doing it.

Also with boss fights it often comes down to ""cause enough damage to the enemy to trigger the kill movie"" because basically all bosses are the same in this regard where you shoot them for a while (maybe hit a specific spot) and then at some point the finisher sequence will start and you can watch a movie of the boss dying with Ethan doing something outside of your control.

And while I can criticize the game I had a good time with it and played it through in 2-3 days (about 15hours) and I added another 2 1/2 hours with the DLC right afterwards. So I would easily recommend RE Village if you can get it while it is on sale.",1681852467,1681852467,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil 8 feels like Capcom sat down and said ""Okay, we feel like our best games in the series were 2,4, and 7. So let's take the best parts of all those games and mash them all together."" And they absolutely hit it out of the park on delivering that!

it has a merchant (called the duke) with buying, selling, upgrading, and finding treasure like resident evil 4 with some sections in the game where you are shooting multiple enemies with plenty of ammo again like 4. 

It has sections with really interesting puzzles and backtracking with barely any shooting while being stalked by a mr x type stalker enemy (lady D) which reminded me of Resident Evil 2. 

And it also had a big section where they took inspiration from Resident Evil 7 which had quite intense horror and puzzle rooms (think the birthday puzzle room in Resi 7). While yes on the whole this game is less scary than the previous entry. This section in particular made me feel more scared and uncomfortable than even Resi 7 (people who have played probably know the section I'm talking about)

The story was fantastic and is of course a sequel to 7. While they do a brief rundown from the events of 7 I still recommend playing 7 first to understand every reference and story callback to that game (also it's just an amazing game you should play). Though it isn't necessary if you watch the 7 recap at the start (or a youtube video to explain 7 if you really don't want to play it for some reason)

The only thing I noticed was usually in past entries the standard difficulty mode was REALLY well balanced for a first playthrough before ramping it up on a second or third playthrough. I noticed here the standard felt a slight bit too easy, especially on boss battles. So word to anyone buying who likes a fair challenge, I would recommend going on the difficulty above standard. Not really a complaint just something I noticed. 

Overall this is a great Resident Evil game. and just a good game in general. As with all these games, new difficulties, cosmetics, weapons, and beating your time, all await you after the credits roll and I look forward to further playthroughs. 

Well done Capcom you've smashed it again! like they did with 7 and the remakes. The future of resident evil feels like it's in very safe hands and has a clear identity again.",1681779900,1681779900,True,7,0,0.558389663696289063,0,True,False,False

Which one someone likes more is obviously a matter of taste, but I think the seventh part had a stronger effect on me. [i]Village[/i] is undoubtedly a very interesting game, but the more I played it, the more I wondered if it would ever end, because although they tried to diversify the environment, in the end, all your actions were very similar, and I personally was not fascinated by the story as well. I often felt like I had seen or played it somewhere before - all these symbols and themes etc. Sometimes I also had the feeling that the whole village could be a bit more interactive or lively. The few domestic animals that scurried around here and there and could be shot for soup material added a little, but I would have liked it if there was something else to make the whole area not so dull. Yes, the key may be in the word ""isolated"" (environment), but there is a limit somewhere. Because one thing is an isolated and abandoned small territory, another thing is a whole big map that needs to be filled with something. Maybe what I mean is that something could have surprised every now and then. I don't know, maybe a plane could have made an emergency landing or a school bus could have lost its way there. Just something to work with. But there were only similar-looking houses and enemies that appeared from time to time. Okay, there were also puzzles, not all areas in the village were accessible at the very beginning. Also, I'm not convinced if the four main bosses were put into the game in the best order. Because after Lady Dimitrescu, none of the subsequent areas in the game were that gripping. But at the same time, it was a turning point, from where the game became more action-like and focused less and less on sneaking, so maybe it was necessary for the overall picture of the game. Anyway, in my opinion, all in all a good entertainment, maybe a bit long, but overall definitely a recommended game for those who like the genre.

and this one is actually good in all of them, but just good, not amazing. first of all let me say that it is an action game, yes like I said It has the scares but it's not a big deal. there are so many good things in this game how ever there is a BUT after every single one of them. let me explain:
[list]
[*]Character design is amazing BUT they are not scary at all 
[*]It's a really fun action game BUT it's sooo easy even on the hardest difficulty
[*]It has some scary moment BUT not that scary
[*]Different type of enemies and they really cool BUT they all do the same thing, they are maybe 3 groups that each group do the same thing
[*]And ... 
[/list]
Over all I really loved the game but for me it's not the best Resident Evil game 
I really had a fun time playing it. I even spend time to get all the achievements and it was great.

the only thing that I didn't like was things that they add as DLCs, non of them worth your time and money.

at the end I really recommend this game it's a really cool RE game. 
you know about some RE games I say that just pass them or watch them on Youtube but about this one, you have to play it but there are even better RE games out there

Village reminds me that Capcom can still deliver new ideas while holding onto the essence that is Resident Evil.
Updated recently with the 3rd person camera mode makes the game a little more enjoyable for me.

I just went back and rated RE3 Remake again and I feel so invigorated that I'm gonna write a full review for this one too. It's been a minute since I played it so this won't be a great review (but who's gonna see it anyway?) I'm no OG player but as someone who's completed about 4.2833333 RE games, (33.333% of RE4 remake, 95% of Biohazard and all of 2 Remake, 3 Remake and Village) I think I'm qualified enough to say this game is pretty subversive as far as the series goes. This is the most recent entry in the main series and the most recent chronologically as well. It is the second and final game involving Ethan Winters, a boring but sweet protagonist who will forever live in Leon's shadow. This game is very good. I like how much it goes against things it already establishes during the game, from lord to lord in new and wacky scenarios. I love the ending, the lore, and the possibility of seeing Rose in future installments. I actually have less to say about this game than I thought so I feel stupid right now. What's new? Anyway, I liked my first experience with having a dedicated shop where you could collect treasures to sell for money. I love games with collectibles, especially when they appear on the map. I forget if they appear on the map here or not but uh. Cooking was an interesting mechanic which I enjoyed. Every area felt unique. The voice acting for everyone except Ethan and a couple of other characters was kind of mediocre. Interestingly enough, this game introduces the megamycete as the source of all of the chaos seen in the franchise thus far but actually does a lot less explaining or rationalizing the effects it has on the enemies and characters seen in this game compared to the previous ones. My fingers are freezing because of the vent underneath my desk so I'm gonna end this review by saying that this game is, for a Resident Evil game, a breath of fresh air and a good ending to the new experimental first-person horror style, even if this one was kind of a departure from horror and more into action territory.",1674797988,1681019329,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First my knowledge with Resident Evil started from 7-th part, and I really enjoyed this game. I have played Resident Evil Village twice: first time I passed this game when it was released on Mac and second time - now in Steam.

[h1] Main Plot [/h1]

The story of Village is a direct sequel of part 7. From the very beginning I had many questions to what is happening. The game very beautifully sets the tone and the formed questions after the introduction make you run forward for answers.

We don’t have straight answers until the very end, and only before the last fight game gives us all answers and admirably connect this part with the whole RE saga.

RE Village doesn’t give all answers in cutscenes, in turn, more answers are given in notes. This is done in the spirit of the old parts, where there were no beautiful cutscenes, and all the answers had to be given in the form of notes scattered throughout the game.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

When I was playing the first time - I really was scared almost all the game. This game doesn’t have many screamers, in turn it casts a mood of constant anxiety. During the passage, my mood changed very quickly from panic and apathy to peace and tranquility in the save rooms. So all gaming experience may be explained as emotional rollercoaster.

The game is based on Village [spoiler] and 4 extra locations with 4 boss fights + the final boss. In the house of Beneviento game takes all our weapon and we need to pass it only by solving puzzles. [/spoiler] And it was the most scary part of the game.

The last location is [spoiler] Heisenbergs factory [/spoiler] and it is the only location during which I was tired from the game. This location is very big and long. And due to this location I felt boring. When I played this game second time, only [spoiler] Heisenbergs factory [/spoiler] was stopping me from playing.

[h1] DLC and third person view [/h1]

DLC Shadow of Rose is made perfectly in all canons of DLSs. Where taken already Ken locations, has been changed to fit the new story and was realized as a new small game. And it was done perfectly. The second location which is [spoiler] Beneviento’s house [/spoiler] I was really scared and got all emotions which I wanted to have.

I haven’t played the RE village with a third person view, but have seen few play throughs, and what I have understood is - all screamers and cutscenes are done for a first person view. So those who really want to try it as s new old experience may lose a big part of emotions. As well need to notice that in all cutscenes camera moves to a first person view, even if you play with third person view. According to this I believe that this is a detriment to the player immersion.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

I have really enjoyed Resident Evil Village, that’s one of those games which I enjoyed to play second time. DLC Shadow of Rose is not bad, it had many good moments, but I haven’t seen in it any of revealing hidden storylines. For all my gaming experience I haven’t seen any of gaming bugs or optimization problems. So from technical side game looks really perfect.
I may easily recommend this game if you enjoy some horror.",1680990264,1680990317,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

Just the right amount of terror, I had a much easier time playing this one since my nerves weren't frayed for the first several hours like they were in 7. It's still tense and spooky, and has one horror segment that is likely scarier than anything in 7, but the enemy/character designs, the variety, amazing art direction and memorable areas make this much more appealing as a new-wave RE game compared to 7(for me anyway).

This one also has many more mainline lore tie-ins and gets me excited thinking about where they go from here. I'm going to withhold my one and only criticism since it is technically a spoiler.

Now there is a certain part of the story which was quite scary but that was a relatively short part of the game. 

I myself usually avoid linear scripted games and generally play open world games but because I enjoyed Resident Evil 7 a lot I gave this one a chance as well and was most pleasantly surprised. The DLC Shadows of Rose also complements the main story really well, it is a great story.

In short the game is a very solid 8/10 for me
Pros:
The visuals, story and atmosphere are all 10/10 keeping you immersed and invested in the game and the sound is good as well. Despite the game being linear they have added a lot of progression and interesting features to keep people entertained for at least 2 to 3 campaigns which would be 15 to 30 hours. I guess for a linear game this should be counted as a good thing. Progression system in the game is done really well.

Cons:
Gunplay itself is not too great but definitely the best of all RE games. Despite being the best linear game I have ever played I will still count the game being a linear game as a con. Once you finish the story the immersion diminishes because the game itself is heavily scripted so you are not surprised by the events in the game anymore but still the progression might be enough to keep quite a few players playing despite that.

Definitely a great game, I got it on sale myself but wouldn't regret the purchase even if it was full price.",1680731623,1680732078,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game has very good characters actually well just Dimitrescu family. Because Miranda is cringe as hell, Heisenberg is your usual tough guy and there's pathetic Morbeau which could have been much much better if they didn't decide absurd design decisions. And the last Beneviento family maybe the worst of all. Because the puzzle they designed is so straightforward and throughout the level there's no tension at all. Because level design is so linear, it's very obvious what to do when chase occurs.

Inventory management becomes completely useless, don't bother purchasing inventory upgrades at all. You can carry basically unlimited amount of crafting materials and if you create them when you need, probably you never run into any kind of problem when dealing with inventory.

Except for the first ambush part, you'll never have a problem with ammo. In the last fight I had 60-70 sniper bullets and each of them deals 2k damage. Naturally boss can't stand a chance and it was terribly designed boss as well. Merchant system makes the looting a lot more worthless because after some point game starts giving you money instead of useful resources. So that you can buy everything you want since merchant stocks replenish frequently. And yes this happens at hardcore difficulty. I can't even think how the game looks like in lower difficulties.

At start, I thought this game we'll be spending more time within the castle instead of village like Dimitrescu family becomes our nemesis and we occasionally run into each other but no. Castle level is progressed so fast and most iconic characters passed away without doing any significant thing. Literally they're wasted for nothing. Because there's no ""tension"" when a scripted chase occurs, because you know when you got into some room you just got away and game leaves you alone until you progress to another section. There's zero randomness in this game, everything is scripted and lots of cinematic scenes which takes the control away from you thus kills the immersion.

Factory level feels so empty, over-designed because there's not enough content inside of it. Just empty large rooms most of them has no loot or readable thing at all. Enemies are so bland and scarce. They really missed a chance to horde of machines chasing us similiar to like at the start. Heisenberg fight is a literal joke, he couldn't even perform one of his skills and just got killed in seconds on my first try. 

Reservoir could have been very different if they give Morbeau to ability to hit through any kind of obstacle instead of just passing through some thin lines. He's literally a giant fish and yet can't even properly catch you even the place its home. And that boss fight is also terrible as well.

There's no story. Even saying bad is an insult to the word itself. Last hours of this game belongs to something else, I still can't believe it. Such a cringe, bland and hollow way to end the Ethan's story. Game wants you to feel ""something"" but with this kind of dialogues and actions, all you can do is laughing it at.

Capcom greatly fails to innovate gameplay, level and boss designs. Instead they keep removing stuff, makes the game a lot easier and as a result removing the tension because you can kill everything with your super powered weapons. You can skip past some monsters but when you don't have to worry about ammo why would you do that? When I'm playing I felt more like it's a cheap copy of Doom.

If you want a very casual shooter game, you'll definitely like this. If you're an RE fan, you probably be disappointed.",1680703755,1680703755,False,8,1,0.557780265808105469,0,True,False,False

Is the newest chapter in Capcom's popular survival horror franchise. The game follows on from RE 7: Biohazard, (2017), and is full of blood, fright and a lot of action.

[h1]Complex plot...[/h1]
In this new Resident Evil game, once again the player lives a story starring Ethan, the main character of RE 7 After the torturous events of the 2017 game, the character tries to return to normality alongside his wife Mia and daughter Rosemary . However, right at the beginning of Village, he is surprised by the already known Chris Redfield, who murders Mia and kidnaps Rose.

Knocked out in a fight with Chris, Ethan wakes up in a village completely in ruins, which seems to have a special fondness for a quasi-religious figure named Mother Miranda. There, he starts his journey in search of Rosemary, facing several enemies and unraveling countless secrets.

[b]Although it looks simple at first glance, the plot is actually quite complex. Under the premise of a father's search for his daughter, several mysteries are kept that involve even the history of the formation of the main company of Resident Evil, the Umbrella Corporation. The entire unfolding of the narrative deepens as we advance in the game, and the icing on the cake is its completely surprising outcome.[/b]

Despite its complex story, the game is relatively short and can be beaten in about ten hours. As usual in Resident Evil, however, Village keeps some treasures and small parallel missions, which make the user want to play it more than once. In addition, there is also the return of the Mercenaries mode to challenge the player even more.

It's worth saying that even those who don't know Resident Evil 7 can play Village without major problems. This is because the game presents a retrospective of previous history right at the beginning, situating those who did not live through the horrors of Biohazard. However, for better understanding and even affinity with this new storyline, it might be a good idea to play the 2017 game.

[h1]Powerful and well-varied enemies[/h1]
In the demo released, Capcom knew how to hide the depth of the story of Resident Evil Village very well. If we started the gameplay with the certainty that our biggest enemy would be the already known Lady Dimitrescu, we were soon surprised: there are at least three other villains that we must defeat.

They are Donna Beneviento, Salvatore Moreau and Karl Heisenberg. They are Mother Miranda's followers, and each poses different difficulties to the player. It is worth mentioning that, for TechTudo, the most terrifying moments were due to Beneviento, while the greatest battle difficulties were found with Heisenberg.

Furthermore, Resident Evil Village is also interesting for the variety of types of enemies. In this game, there are vampires, witches, killer dolls, creatures that resemble werewolves and even robotic villains, in a striking cyberpunk aesthetic. The tip here is that the headshot is not always the main way out - however, it's always a good idea to keep your aim properly calibrated.

[h1]Guaranteed horror with terrifying soundtrack[/h1]
This new Resident Evil game is definitely one of the scariest in the franchise. To keep a comparison in mind, the last time I felt so terrified of a game in the series was with Resident Evil 2, released for PSOne in 1998.

In addition to having several jump scares to scare players, Village also has a haunting soundtrack that keeps players in a constant state of tension. It is even possible that this is the scariest track of all the games in the series, delivering a magnificent job of setting in survival horror.

[h1]Excellent graphics in realistic scenarios[/h1]
As expected, the RE Engine did an excellent job on Resident Evil Village, which features exquisite lighting and realistic environments. The video game engine was launched in 2017, for Biohazard, and now comes with a game that runs well even on more limited hardware consoles - as is the case with the PS4.

Although the very characterization of the characters, such as Lady Dimitrescu and Salvatore Moreau, for example, is interesting in itself, what most called attention during the tests was the beauty and realism of the scenarios. From the tense scenes in the Dimitrescu castle to the unpleasant moments in the Heisenberg factory, the game maintains neat environments full of details at practically all times.

In Resident Evil Village, even the ugly is beautiful. The only exception to this logic is perhaps a moment present in the second boss of the game, Donna Beneviento. However, although it involves a frightening situation, the setting of the scene is still impressive, making its horror justified.

[h1]Traditional and expected franchise mechanics[/h1]
Like any other game in the franchise, Resident Evil Village demands a lot of curiosity and exploration from the player. It is always necessary to look closely at each object collected, as some must be assembled and/or disassembled to actually be used.

It is interesting to note, however, that in this new chapter of the Capcom series some items have extended lifespans. In addition, there are regions that, although they appear at the beginning of the game, must be explored later.

To facilitate the trajectory, the map of Resident Evil Village is quite intuitive. It shows in a simplified way if there is still something to be explored in each of the available areas, but its simplicity can be a real headache for players who like to collect any and all items.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Resident Evil Village is an excellent new chapter in Capcom's traditional franchise. With mechanics already known and loved, the game made a beautiful debut in the new generation.

Although it has a slightly long ending, all the hours invested are justified by the complexity of the story. With beautiful graphics and well-developed villains, Resident Evil Village ends Ethan Winters' journey with a flourish, pleasing a lot with its surprising and terrifying gameplay.

First of all this is a direct sequel of Resident Evil 7, continuing with the story of Ethan and his family.

I've kinda become a big fan of the franchise after playing RE7 a few months ago, and have played all of the new RE engine ones since (including 4 remake), and enjoyed all of them but this one. 
The rewarding exploration and problem solving of the previous games is largely absent, replaced with monotonous trudging around a linear path of houses and sheds or stone hallways. The village is not fun to explore; you don't get to just walk around it because that would too convenient, instead half the areas are blocked off by a tree or something meaning you have to go through a house and into the backyard where there is a shed that has a small hole on one side that you have to go through (although its easy to miss because there are a ton of sheds and outhouses that don't have anything in them). Most of these areas aren't even level-gated, there is no reason for the geography of the village to be so frustrating to navigate.
Its not really good as a survival horror game because it's not scary and I never really struggled to survive as ammo and health were plentiful and I never ran out of inventory space on normal difficulty. Not that I wish I had played on a higher difficulty because the combat encounters aren't really enjoyable and I can't imagine a higher difficulty making them anything other than more annoying. Resident Evil 7 just executed the first person horror so much better.
It's not really good as an action game because shooting stuff isn't exciting, guns aren't punchy or satisfying, and enemies aren't fun to fight. Also Ethan controls really awkwardly. Also I didn't know where to put this complaint but the big tiddy vampire lady is only in it for like 2 hours.
I probably have more to say about it but I don't wanna. Bad game, everything done here is done better by another entry. Don't recommend.

Resident Evil Village is another installment in the beloved survival horror franchise. As a die-hard fan, I was excited to jump back into the world of zombie-infested wastelands and grotesque monsters.

The graphics are top-notch, with detailed environments and character models that will make you feel like you are right there in the creepy village. The sound design is also on point, with every creak and groan sending shivers down your spine.

The real star of the show: Lady Dimitrescu. She is the tall, elegant, and utterly terrifying vampire lady that has taken the internet by storm. And boy, does she live up to the hype. Every time she appears on screen, I found myself both terrified and strangely attracted. I know that I am not alone in this.

Back to the game itself. The gameplay is a nice mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat. The village is full of secrets to uncover, and the puzzles are just challenging enough to keep you engaged without being frustrating. The combat is intense and satisfying, with a variety of weapons to choose from.

More like Resident Evil 'Welcome to the Village, it's gonna be a bumpy ride!' - because this game takes you on a wild and crazy journey through a village filled with werewolves, vampires, and a really creepy doll.

First off, let's talk about the protagonist - Ethan Winters is back and more clueless than ever. I mean, who just follows a random old man into the middle of a creepy village filled with monsters? Ethan, apparently. And let's not forget about his miraculous healing powers - the man can reattach his own hand like it's no big deal.

But the real star of the show is Lady Dimitrescu and her vampire daughters. They're like the Von Trapp family, but with a thirst for blood. And let's be honest, who doesn't love a tall, elegant woman with a taste for the finer things in life? Even if those things happen to be blood and human flesh.

The gameplay is intense and exciting, with plenty of boss battles and moments that will make you jump out of your seat. And let's not forget about the inventory system - because what's a Resident Evil game without some inventory management?

Overall, Resident Evil Village is like a horror version of Beauty and the Beast, with a dash of The Shining thrown in for good measure. It's intense, it's exciting, and it's a lot of fun.

Giving it not recommended cos the HUGE wasted potential pisses me off.. It could have been one of the best survival horror games EVER if they did this like RE7 or RE1/2 remakes.. Super scared they will do the same thing with RE4 and cos of Village I actually didn't preorder RE4RE. (heck I will either wait for a good sale of RE4 or check online to see if its worth the money cos I'm scared it will turn out like this bright mess..)

Things they missed/failed
-Scary night time in the village? What is that? Not present -.- the intro night time doesn't count and the endgame section is call of duty.. Nothing against COD but if I wanna play COD I will play COD not RE -.-. Overall the game is mostly 2 bright (well lit areas and daytime).
-Survival horror? Nah way 2 much action with only 1 actually scary section/area which is like a short P.T. clone..
-Areas: Castle area could have been like a RE1 type mansion with puzzles and tons of areas but instead its mostly linear and even tho it looks big and has multiple floors its not that big at all. Also they invested way 2 much time into the castle (and milking Lady D) so the other areas are way 2 short (srsly the dollhouse and fishman sections are ultra short.. I think they cut the whole mine section of the fishman just cos they were focused on milking Lady D..). Also do they rly expect me to be scared off her daughters when they are all super cute? LMAO.
-Cut content (who knows how much they cut and not to mention that Ada was supposed to play a role in this game)
-Difficulty.. Just stick to the RE2 difficulty or make it a bit harder then it was there.. everything else is 2 easy..
-DLC.. - We want COMPLETE games without DLC cashgrabs.. First they announced that due to great sales and high demand there will be FREE DLCs and then they release a paid DLC.. (might be bad translation so mby they didn't promise FREE DLCs at first). Either way at least the DLC will end the Winters storyline (hopefully). Nothing against the Winters story but cmon fans want a real RE sequel with the main cast (Jill Claire Leon Chris at least! Not to mention Rebecca and Carlos..)

Things it does good?
Welp the graphics are amazing I mean RE engine owns.
Factory area is almost survival horror and was the 1 area that actually felt like I was playing a real RE game
Has some great boss fights
Has a rly nice plot twist from RE7.

Other info:
They connect RE7/8 story (the mold) with the other RE games but honestly the connection for me was super lame and uninteresting.
Mercenaries are back. Literally don't care for the mode and find it plain boring action, but its nice they at least listened to fans cos alot of ppl wanted it.

Srsly C(r)apcom.. Pls give us a proper RE sequel with the main cast and if you rly need 2 cashgrab remakes at least do justice on the Code Veronica one and rework RE5 and 6 into RE2 style survival horror games.. (both games could have been amazing with the proper survival horror touch.. RE6 even started ok with Leon's campaign but was ruined later while the rest ugh.. if ever remade pls do Leons campaign like RE1/2 remakes, Chris campaign like RE3 remake and welp for the rest do good mix of both I guess)",1680353419,1680353419,False,3,0,0.524124264717102051,0,True,False,False

Pros:

1) Gorgeous areas. The first and second areas that the game will take you to (After the side-boss characters are revealed) are truly something else. This is not to say that the others are bad, but those are spectacular.

2) A nice balance between horror elements and more action-oriented bits for the most part of the game. (There is one area that falls short)

3) The DLC adds a lovely bit of extra story, effectively setting up the protagonist character for RE9.

Cons:

1) While the graphics in general are really good, some random textures can look especially rough, almost like they belong to a game from 2008. These are random textures on environmental objects though so its not the worst thing.

2) As with most RE games, do not expect a grounded story that makes complete sense. It is fun, it is entertaining, but if that is not enough, maybe look elsewhere.

3) There is a certain area when you go to a 'stronghold' region in the main story. For that small section, the game becomes far too action-oriented in my opinion.

Edit: Just retried to download it and give it another chance, still met with the same startup error.

Final Edit: Was finally able to play the game. Actual playtime took me about 10hrs to compete the campaign on Normal difficulty with minimal help from walkthroughs. Only the three out of the 5 areas in the game actually felt like a resident evil game, where you have to carefully manage your resources or risk getting stuck before a boss without any ammo. Two areas have incredibly jarring feels to them, almost like those two were more of an afterthought than the other 3. It seems pretty apparent why memes for this game stopped after ""Giant Lady"".

So this is the first resident evil game I beat from start to finish. I'm never really interested in these types of games but decided to give it a try.

Right off the bat im gonna say. The graphics, The atmosphere, level design, audio and overall concept is really impressive.
But the mix and match of:

[spoiler] Vampires, Lycans, ""Zombies"", Paranormal, ""Heisenberg able to control the magnetic fields"", tall big t**** vampire lady with claws, Swamp Shrek acid big fish"", ""Evil dolls"", ""Halloween ready, dressed vampire teenage girls"" and finally ""Cod WW2 zombies lookalikes"" As much as I appreciated the variety of enemy types. It took me right out of the ""Horror"" experience. I found myself cringing multiple times, and going like wtf is this? [/spoiler]

Its like the game director either didn't know what idea to stick with or straight up wanted to make some kind of weird fan fiction. I really couldn't take it seriously for one second and found myself literally running in each room with my shotgun blasting like it was some kind of shooter.

I'm being serious the ONLY time in my entire 9,3h playthrough where I thought the game would finally start to scare me was at the Beneviento house. That was a really interesting and creepy level. (it almost seems like it was inspired by P.T)

I played the previous entry for around 6 hours( until I got bored of backtracking) And it was much more scarier. they say in this game that your supposed to feel powerless but... im sorry hot girls chasing me while I have the firepower of an army is just not it man.

The first half of the game I was really trying to figure out how this game is related whatsoever to RE 7. I guarantee you if you guys saw the trailer and it wasn't named RE 8 you would have never guessed this was a resident evil game.

Basically my overall impression is: WOW this game looks good, This is Cringe, is this supposed to be horror, Meh.

Im giving it a 7/10 its a good game, Entertaining but incredibly short... dont expect to be scared.",1620546641,1680188543,False,16,4,0.358430296182632446,7,True,False,False

First off the good parts: 
- the Art and Design of the things and enemies is pretty good and cool 
- there are parts of the game that have a nice gameplay flow
- good first half

Why don't I like it?
Well, two reasons:
- the writing is getting worse and worse the more you play it
- the last few hours were boring and unimaginative in my opinion (gameplay + story)

My thoughts:
Ethan doesnt work in this game. He is the most boring MC. It made sense for part 7. There it worked because we were trying to survive this hellscape and could imagine very well, how it would be to be in his shoes. 
But in this game the motivation is finding his daughter. Already a position not everyone can relate to. Regardless of if you can imagine yourself as Ethan, there is another problem: the goal is of a more realistic, serious nature. It is portrayed by the game in that way. Allright. I mean part 7 was pretty serious and it worked, so it must work here as well, right?

[b] Incorrect Buzzer Sound [/b]

In 7 it worked, because all the crazy mutation stuff was hidden and only revealed slowly. But this game here is not trying to hide it. The entire premisse is absurd. The children's book thing and the fantasy monsters. It just doesn't fit the more realistic approach of the story. 
The story in itself is full of holes btw. 
It is full of headscratchers and confusing things and the resolution at the end is unsatisfying and incomplete.
Mother Miranda is the most boring supervillain imaginable and I just wanted to get it over with in the end. 

The beginning, where you are introduced with the village and Castle Dimitrescu is pretty good, because the story is kept very brief at this point. The bit with the next villain is very well executed as well, but it is downhill from there.
The story bores and the game gets more filler and plotholes which is not good for a AAA game. I feel like the the part in the factory could have been easily half as long, whitout sacrificing quality.

I get a very marvel movie vibe from the characters in the story, which I don't like. Also a lot of what the game offers is copied from earlier RE entries I feel. Especially, but not exclusively, the end resembles Part 7 in a lot of ways. Without being as effective as the predecessor.

Resident Evil Village (2021) is the 8th installment to the Resident Evil Franchise, this follows up 4 years after the events of Resident Evil 7 (2017) with returning characters Ethan Winters, Mia Winters, and Chris Redfield, along with new characters such as Rosemary Winters, and Chris's Wolf Hound Team which are all part of Blue Umbrella as suspected that Chris Redfield left the BSAA American Branch. The game has similar elements from Resident Evil 4 (2005) with the Merchant Duke, with an actual connection with the Duke and the Merchant from Resident Evil 4 (2005). Though most of the elements that are connected with the 2021 game is Resident Evil 7, same mechanics and some items came back to the 2021 game. Though as to be stated, the game is centered around Europe in which Chris Redfield stationed the Winter Family there for protection, in addition, Rosemary Winters was born in 2020 which Ethan Winters and Mia are the parents. However, both Ethan and Mia before Rosemary was born and after are still stunned and are in a traumatic condition following up to what happened 4 years ago in the 2017 game. Continuing, Rosemary Winters was taken by Mother Miranda as a disguise of Mia Winters while it's later revealed she was taken captive and held for experiments. Chris Redfield and his team tried combating Mother Miranda in the beginning sequence of the game. An enraged Ethan believed that Mia Winters was killed by Chris, but later Chris finally reveals that he was combating Mother Miranda while it wasn't Mia Winters to Ethan. In protection, Chris took Rosemary and Ethan in a van to safety, but was ambushed somehow and Rosemary was suspected to be taken. Ethan waking up and discovering the van completely not functional while the people who were driving it are dead, he later walks in a dark tundra area with a passage which Ethan discovers his mission to save Rosemary and overseeing the Village and Castle D. Which the main course of the game Ethan has to survive and defeat wild and insane enemies. Down below will be the details why I say it's recommended with some setbacks.



[h1] Advantages [/h1]


The advantages of the 2021 game is that most of the elements was taken from other games in the franchise, such as Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 7. The game has excellent graphics, while thus performance, the models, weapons, the story are otherwise excellent. A addition with a first person while in the latest installment of Rosemary Winters adolescents beyond after the end of the 2021 game, along with more The Merchanaries, expansion of Rosemary Winter's story and also third person mode for the main game and the DLC. 




[h1] Disadvantages [/h1]


The game has some setbacks, such as the stalker enemies, Lady D lacked horror, not very a creepy feeling is established when she's following you in the Castle D, and mostly she follows you in the Castle section, and also the Winter  Family story has came to a close with a conclusion that Ethan died and Rosemary Winter's story in conclusion, though I wish there was something more to the story.




[h1] Conclusion [/h1]


I like Resident Evil Village (2021), it's a good game, but I will play this game more in the future when it comes to seeing this game and the accomplishments I see within the game, I will rate this 2021 game down below.

The upgrading of weapons and the style of it is reminiscent of RE4 (even more-so with the RE4remake out) which is a good thing for any fans of that game.

Lots of mutants to fight, and monsters very akin to classic archetypes of Vampires and Lycans, and loads of weapons to play with too. It's a large game and the puzzles are solvable without resorting to walk-through guides

I played the game in third person mode, with 3 very basic mods installed which enhance the animations,  giving Ethan animations from RE2 Remake, and it makes third person mode feel like it was originally intended (outside of the first person cutscenes, of course).

Your home life is interrupted by some evil residents,
You make your way through the titular village, inhabited by many evil residents,
You find yourself in a spooky castle whose residents are (promiscuously) evil,
You get the picture, many residents of evil.

Stupid eye catching intro aside, Resident Evil Village is a great addition to the series we all know and love, and a fantastic sequel to its predecessor released back in 2017. This is another one of a game where I felt compelled to write a long review no one will read because I had such a fantastic experience with it, but more so because I was on the fence about even getting it up until 4 weeks ago when it was on major sale.

To put it bluntly, I thought a lot of the hype around this game was purely because of the ""big mommy vampire meme hehe,"" wave that EXPLODED and was inescapable when the trailer dropped. That compiled with this horror setting from the 1930s (feudal village and spooky castle) paired with classic movie monsters (vampires, werewolves, swamp creatures), had me confused about what this game was going for and how it fit into the series. I wasn't particularly interested and it took a super sale, coupled with my longing for the RE:4 Remake and needing something to tide me over before its release for me to pull the trigger. Simply put, I've got no regrets: I beat the game multiple times, completed every challenge minus DLC, and frankly should have jumped on the Dimitrescu bandwagon earlier. 

Going back to my previous point: how does this game fit into the series? While it contains everyone's favourite boulder punching a-hole, I view RE:7 and 8 as separate from the main series. They're their own unique games and it's not just because of the shift to first person. I think what sets these games apart is that Capcom really struck a perfect balance of ridiculous, over the top, WTF plots, with fantastic characters, amazingly portrayed and brought to life, set in truly unique environments, which can be considered characters themselves. Take RE:7, the focal point of that game was the Baker family and their disgustingly beautiful Louisiana plantation manor. The three antagonists in that game were incredibly iconic, making for scenes ranging from unsettling, to hilarious, to terrifying. It also helped the player build up these twisted relationship with each of them, ultimately culminating in memorable showdowns.  

That formula is repeated here, but built out further with Mother Miranda and her ""family."" This is where RE:8 truly shines: here's a cast of truly memorable misfits, each one more unique than the last, but most importantly, all fantastically voiced and acted. I know everyone loves to talk about Lady D (for obvious reasons, memes or not), and yes she is an amazing character (Maggie Robertson killed), but honestly all the children do such a fantastic job. I'd argue Neil Newbon as Heisenberg is equally fantastic and makes for such a fun villain. How he enunciates ""Mother Miranda, that b**ch,"" will forever by stuck in my head and his showdown was quite the- experience to say the least. My point is that these wild and wacky characters, brought to life by passionate VA's make this game such a fun time. On my first playthrough, I couldn't wait until my next encounter, but there were moments in subsequent playthroughs where I'd happily watch cutscenes in their full length.

The other thing to point out is that this game never takes itself too seriously, and that's why it truly shines compared to other RE games. They really nailed the precedence RE:4 set back in 2005, but the series seemed to lose shortly thereafter *cough* RE:6 *cough*. There's actually a lot of parallels to RE:4 and this game and probably the reason why I had such a great time with it. But in terms of plot, this game takes place in a spooky village straight outta Transylvania a la 1800s with werewolves and vampires, there's no way to play that seriously and thank god they don't. You can tell the devs had a lot of fun coming up with the story, characters and setting, and honestly if it weren't for the title and one character, this could just as easily not be an RE game. Aside from that, this plot has more twists and turns that a daytime soap opera. There's drama, romance, highs/lows, aforementioned memorable characters, plot twists, ect- my god it's got it all and never seems to hold back. In fact as the game progresses, it gets even more ridiculous, but again it embraces it and is even able to poke fun at itself at times. I think a fair comparison could actually be how Metal Gear treats its stories: serious plot/setting, sprinkled with moments that come out left field. 

In terms of gameplay, just like the characters and plot, it's a wild ride. This game has something for everyone. One minute it's survival horror, then it takes a complete 180 and suddenly you're playing something akin COD, mercilessly blasting everything in sight. It can be a walking sim, then a looter shooter, hoarding every penny for an insane weapon upgrade. It has horror moments hiding in lockers straight from Amnesia and then classic RE puzzle moments solving nonsensical/overly complicated door locks with statue pieces. Then you're fighting a boss that violently transforms into some eldritch abomination- it's all here and you better be ready. Caught up in this whole mess is our protagonist turned super dad Ethan Winters (also fantastically voiced), and if you loved how much of a literal punching bag he was in RE:7, this game is your wet dream. It's an absolute roller coaster of emotions seeing how much abuse poor Ethan takes in this game, yet inspiring how he perseveres through it all. I don't want to spoil the fun, but they really up the punishment compared to what he endured in RE:7 and don't hold back at all.

Now I mentioned RE:4 and yes, this game screams of RE:4 and I'm all for it. I'll admit it's a bias on my part- RE:4 was my official introduction to the series on GameCube back in 05 and it left quite the impression on me. That game introduced a lot of elements to the series that are now quintessentially ""Resident Evil,"" and it was such a welcome surprise to see them back in this game. There's the setting of course (castle, village, swamps), but also treasure hunting/combining is back, along with a currency to spend at a merchant for buying/upgrading weapons. Special shout out to The Duke- he is an absolute pleasure to deal with and sucg a fun side character encountered throughout the game. Also, love it or hate it, the RE:4 attache case and inventory management is here too, which is a fun minigame on its own. It's interesting because the RE:4 remake was clearly in development while this game was, and while there are a lot of parallels between the two (btw: the Remake is phenomenal and I'll be reviewing it as well), RE:8 offers its own unique flavour to the mix.

My only critiques with this game are first; the movement speed. My god is Ethan slow, its RE:7 all over, and even with a supposed ""speed increase perk"" you move at a snails pace, which can be especially frustrating during enemy heavy encounters (the ending for example- yikes). Second, sound design for weapons is hit or miss. A lot of the guns sound like peashooters, even after maxing them out, and it just seems off. Thirdly, while the game looks fantastic and runs superbly on damn near max settings (even on my older 2070), how certain things are rendered in the RE engine can be weird. You'll go from beautiful, hyper detailed interiors, to smoke/clouds that look like literal pixels, or animations being jerky/stop motion like when viewed at a distance. I'm sure it's to help performance, but it kills immersion at times.

Anyway this is long and I'm rambling. TL;DR, come for the vampire mommy, stay for the wild ride of a story and engaging gameplay it has to offer",1679902647,1679902647,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False

Everything that made 7 fresh with adjustments to improve it, with a lot of the qualities you’d expect on a game so heavily nostalgic to 4.
While it would never top that gauntlet of a game, it tries it’s best by having a wide variety of environments that all behave differently from the last, with a great progression feel and changes of the situations you come across.
The game starts strong, then fuzzles for a tad in a two-section that was admittedly a breeze on a second run, to end strong with one of the best levels of the series. There is a section after I flat out dislike but it lasts like five minutes at least.
In general it’s more of the polished good looking camp, even if I do lament how puzzle-lacking it is however. While I do argue it’s the best mainline we had in a while, it certainly is not perfect, and if you don't enjoy it’s shooter heavy approach, you’re absolutely not going to see anything else here.

Once you’re done with the campaign, there is the replay incentive of NG+, maximizing the gun upgrades, unlockables and the return of the beloved Mercenaries for pure arcade joy, albeit changed into a mediocre linear shooting gallery in actual structure.

That’s really the sentiment I have in general, enjoyment. This was the best time I had with a mainline entry in a while, and the second FOV is patched I have zero hesitation to recommend it to newcomers or established fans, further if in a discount.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I...

A lot of walking, beautiful environments and graphics but very little to interact with or read. Very few item descriptions setting the scene. It's a very slow start but once you've played for a few hours things heat up quite a bit...The action is what sets this apart from previous games. Unlike RE7 there are a variety of enemies to play with. Some are big, some are small and some can fly...a huge improvement. Action can be stressful as taking down enemies isn't as easy as just shooting them as wasting ammo will leave you vulnerable. The animations of the enemies is so advanced now that hitting a head shot feels special and you'll want to hit them, not for a one shot kill, but for a slight knockback...Blocking/defending is also more relevant now. Once you block you can press the button again to push the enemy away with a kick and a shove. Again, worthwhile learning this one early on as it becomes integral within combat to stay safe, save ammo and place your shots in the right places!The story is OK and the characters are interesting. Classic Resi Evil really...far fetched but well done...Turns into a real journey once you hit the 4-5 hour mark...it's paced well with the beats in gameplay changing at the right times as well as good upgrades/weapon goals...Performance is good, it runs a lot better than RE7 did upon release. I've got an old i5 processor and a GTX980Ti and I've got most of the settings on high. No frame drops or pauses to be seen anywhere!!I've put this review to ""Not recommended"" as they locked third person view behind DLC. Disgusting practise! These games would sell even better if these extra quests and view changes were unlockable during gameplay. This has also been repeated for the recent RE4 release with unnecessary DLC. Capcom would get a lot of respect and even more cash in the longrun if it stopped this.

Just one day before the RE4 Remake comes out. It took me 2 years and multiple restarts with giant gaps between play sessions. It probably doesn't seem like I love Resident Evil 8...but I do love Resident Evil 8.I can't entirely explain how i got so distracted so many times but every time I sat down to play this game i had an absolute blast and yet I didn't come back for some time. Resident Evil 8 is not particularly scary...at all really. I mean there's that one level that everyone talks about. It's spooky once. I certainly jumped a few times but none of this game really scared me. RE8 is very campy horror. It's fun horror but maybe that's why it's so fun. I love the aesthetic of horror even when it doesn't scare me.Resident Evil 8 is also not particularly challenging. This is one of the easiest RE games i've ever played. Resource management isn't really a thing. Maybe on the higher difficulties and maybe i'll try those some day but i barely died in this game. Barely ever ran out of ammo. Not that you can't instantly craft more with your bottomless crafting inventory. It's not ideal but it's in no way a deal breaker for me. The shooting is fun and the enemies are fun to shoot. I'm not complaining. So what worked for me if the game wasn't scary and the gameplay didn't challenge me? Just being in this world. It's just fun. The 4 antagonists are a lot of fun with huge personalities and their own personal domains. Each sporting a different campy horror theme. 2 of them clearly have more love given than the others. So basically you have 2 well crafted villain domains and the other 2 are shorter set piece driven sections. That's where the Village itself comes in. It's ever expanding as a sort of central hub that you keep returning to. Sporting more treasure and threats every time you return to it. So besides the charm of the setting, themes and villains the other part that really worked for me was the story and Ethan Winter's himself. As a Father the story of village really effected me way more than it would have a few years ago. I know it's become a meme to make fun of Ethan but he's easily my favorite RE protagonist. Sure he's goofy and arguably kind of stupid sometimes but he's an every man. A dad who will do anything to save his daughter. I unironically love his cheesy trash talk that he spits out every time he takes out a big enemy. ""Hell yeah brother! Tell em!"" His insults are hilariously tone deaf and sometimes unnecessarily nasty and they never ceased to make me laugh or sometimes they just buffed my ego. Give me Ethan Winters over Chris Redfield any day. Village currently still has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on steam and I remember people being super positive on it when it came out but recently the discourse seems to have soured on it significantly. Not so for me. It certainly doesn't fit with old school RE games in terms of tone or themes but when you reach the 8th mainline game in a series (more if you include all the remakes and spinoffs) you have to reinvent yourself. Without this new direction and the remakes I doubt the series would still be going this strong. I love the og RE titles and we can have both but for my money I'd prefer Resident Evil to keep being this Horror Bio Weapon Anthology series over the endless ""evil corporation with zombies vs 80's action movie characters"" thing. Keep being weird and keep being fun and that's all i can really ask for.",1679620115,1679620115,True,0,0,0.483535528182983398,0,True,False,False

Currently there is an update for the game to play the game in VR, on PSVR2 that is, but the great thing is that there is also a VR mod for PC, which is unofficial, but still immerses you in the game with the great VR experiences.
Those who have the game in their library and also have a VR setup should definitely try this, it's really cool and it feels like this game was made for VR, other Resident Evil too by the way, there are still VR mods for The remakes of RE 2 & 3 which are also great this way with intense tensions.

You can watch a snippet of gameplay from The Village in VR here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4TM3lN0a64

Resident Evil: Village is a very successful horror game that does an excellent job in many areas.
The structure of the game world is strong, both in the atmosphere that is always created and in the way in which the different parts of the world are connected through the village.
The structure is also good in the story, where the player finds out bit by bit what is going on.
The game has a good balance between wandering, puzzles and action.
If you're on the Resident Evil train, this is another tour de force, and if you're not, it's a surprisingly welcoming place to start.
The game enjoys its tone and delivers an Eastern European nightmare world that's an absolute blast to play whether you're sneaking with caution or shooting live.",1679528084,1679528084,True,35,0,0.75674062967300415,4,True,False,False

In hindsight, I don't really think RE is the right franchise to do Gothic horror. I think Capcom creating a new IP for something like this would've made more sense. Granted, the artistry and world design of this game is top notch, but I feel like its existence doesn't really build upon any of the cool setup that 7 did and it doesn't really add anything overall in terms of story. 

The combat, while better than 7's, feels pretty middle of the road. I suppose the best comparison you could make would be with Resi4, but enemies are nowhere near as responsive to gunshots/attacks. The combat almost feels like padding in between Village's various set pieces, which are pretty memorable to be fair. I don't think this is a bad choice for people who are new to the franchise. If you want a resident evil game that's a bit heavier on action and less anxiety inducing, Village, Resi4, and Resi5 (if you can put up with co-op) aren't bad options. However, if you're a classic RE fan and are looking to get back into the series, I'd play 7 or wait a few days for Resi4 remake to come out.",1620756097,1679512785,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is interesting enough to the point I wanted to play more but I would never play the game again after finishing it. The story is a bit chaotic when you haven't played the prior game/s, still have no idea who Evelyn is.
 
I'm usually afraid of any game like this, but didn't find this to be scary, if anything it would be the very narrow field of view which is locked and the very slow movement speed which makes you feel trapped.
The main character has some disgustingly bad dialogue which is common for games nowadays, finished it in 8 hours looting pretty much all I could find and making most of the dishes for buffs.

My initial play through, where i took my time and looked for everything took me exactly 10 hours. Which is a perfect length for a Resident Evil title. Like the older titles, this game lends itself very well to speed runs. You can take your time, enjoying the world building and taking in every aspect of the game OR you can bum rush through the whole game as fast as possible, My fastest time sits right at 2 hours and 11 minutes.

Resident Evil is truly back in these past few years (barring 3 remake depending on who you ask) and I truly hope the rumors of a RE4 remake is true because if it applies the RE4 inspired aspects of RE8 we are gonna have a home run.

The gameplay and some levels are the more apparent issues but don't detract the experience. A worthy buy specially on discount. Although I feel the Original and not Gold is more worth your while, unless you want the Shadows of Rose DLC.

It's been an up and down for me since I've started continuing to play the RE series. Been playing up to RE5, then recently started with RE2/RE3 remake (which were brilliant), then played RE6 and RE7 - but had to drop both mid-game as I didn't feel like it was the RE that I liked/loved.

RE6 suffered from non-stop action fueled testicle and liver smoothie generator.
RE7 suffered from identity crisis followed by looking for inspiration from popular first-person horror games.

RE6 I could never recommend.
RE7 I concede is a great game and I do recommend, yet it wasn't for me.

RE8 tho? Fuck me, that was one of my Top RE games if not the top game. I'm glad I didn't play on release since the newest DLC added a third-person option. You know, I'm not 100% sure but I personally feel like first-person horror comes with the knowledge that whatever happens to scare you - it'll happen in your viewpoint. Like when you're going down a hallway, you always can expect something coming in front of you. With third-person you're much more likely to see your surroundings (similar like in Real Life since you're usually not looking through a tunnel but can see shit happening at your side (peripheral view)), maybe appreciate more details and be prepared for *anything* and not just whatever comes in front of you.

Despite VIIIage not being designed for but as a afterthought for third-person, it was a delight still. The level design was superb, I almost felt like playing RE4 back again (Can't wait for the remake of RE4 soon). The story was very good, and questions over questions were eventually answered at the end, as you're thrown into a village with little to know except to survive. Boss fights felt more like the usual RE style - you can shoot your way, but still needed sometimes a thing or two to activate to be able to do weaken it. 

There's also an addition which I usually don't like in other games, but was executed well: Mini-Bosses.

The range of weapons is great, however, I do not know why it was considered necessary to introduce you the same weapon type over and over again with a new model which has its base power well over your modified/upgraded weapon you already possess. It almost makes you feel stupid for solving puzzles finding upgrades when it becomes obsolete in 1-2 hours by a new one...",1679378180,1679389091,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Village, being the 8th main installment in the RE franchise follows Ethan Winters a few years after the events of Resident Evil 7, and it is a good continuation of the Winters' family & their story.

I have been getting into Resident Evil recently, starting with 7, as I know the franchise is really good & I really want to be into it now. After finishing the freak-horrorshow that was Resident Evil 7, my next game was of course Village. RE Village is not nearly as scary as the previous entry but it does not suffer from that, it still has its scares of course, but it is not near the amount as 7. There is one specific area (that I won't name to not spoil!) that is very scary, not exactly the level as RE7, but quite close.

The main big bosses of Village are very different from one another, but are one big family! You will definitely enjoy meeting this odd group of siblings, and their mother.

The game begins with your baby daughter, Rosemary Winters, being taken to an unknown place. This happens with an intense sequence of events that will be especially shocking to players who successfully completed RE7 and saw the ending. Many things happen until you find yourself walking a very dark, cold and snowy path in the woods. How you got here? I won't tell, but you'll see. It's intense. This path leads you to a Village of course, and your quest begins there: Find Rose. It's an intense ride, and Ethan Winters surely wasn't prepared.

Before witnessing the terror within this mysterious Village, I highly highly recommend you play it's direct predecessor, RESIDENT EVIL 7. There, you will learn all about Ethan Winters himself, his wife Mia Winters, and the journey that led them to this point. That game is a roller-coaster of horror and you will love it, I am sure.

Both RE7 and Village don't connect too much with previous entries in the franchise, as 7 was a soft-reboot of sorts, but you should definitely still play the rest! You witness great terror, many catastrophes and a great cast of characters, all fighting to rid the world of bioweapons.
This game has one returning character: Chris Redfield! He's a lovable character and usually the hero, but he seems to be much more dark and brooding here... just look at that cover art!

Village was a great experience for me and I can't help but love it. I am really hoping you will too.

Yknow what my solution has become? Use adhesive putty, put it on the screen at top and bottom then use black lego pieces to cover the entire black sections so I don't see the mouse cursor when it goes there. This is inexcusably fucking incompetent on Capcom's behalf.

Anyway, I'm just gonna keep the negative train rolling cause they don't deserve less from this incompetence.

SPOILER WARNING GOING AHEAD

So when you get to this guy with a shotgun he is pulled by a wereman up into the attic and then blood comes down and after Ethan goes ""say whaaaaat"" a werearm shoot up through the floor and grabs onto your leg and pulls you into the root cellar or whatever below the house where a ton of bodies are stacked up. After moving about 3 feet another cutscene moment happens where a weremouth nibbles a few of your fingers and then throws you through a wall outside. When you kill the werewas you notice that the wall is destroyed. Ah, because YOU got thrown outside. Got it. Wait... I was in the basement... This hole leads to the kitchen where I got pulled down from. Wait... Why is there no hole in the floor? So let's recap. Me = Kitchen, first floor. Arm, pulls me through floor. Me = Basement. Thrown through wall = Outside. Outside perspective looking at the house, the wall that is destroyed leads to kitchen. Kitchen has no hole in the floor form where weredere pulled you down into.

What in the world is happening?

[edit2]

Right, so a few more things.

The werefolk surround you and get ready to kill you but then don't because they wanted a scene that would look cool but didn't want to commit as the game would obviously be over at that point and so then just have them scurry off because of plot armor.

Then you come across a field where some of them are still there and they reaaaally want to kill you. So why didn't some of them just stay behind previously to just kill you?

Anyway you come across a bunch of people and yknow what I hate in horror anything? When characters just exist solely for the reason to die. It's so boring. They introduce like 6 or something characters who wear their character on their sleeve and then just kill them off. And it's like, what was the point of that? Why even bother introducing characters that you're just gonna kill off? Why? Cause spectacle. At the end the girl who came with her father falls down into the fire and dies and you fail to save her and it's like they want the payoff of a great story moment while putting in the absolute bare minimum.

So you leave the burning house and can finally enter the castle.

Before I comment on that though.

The gameplay is inspired by REvil 4 but has none of the charm or variety. Remember how you could vault out of 2nd story windows? Or Even just 1st story windows? Can't here. Remember how you could shoot a fernando in the knee to make him drop down then dropkick his ass? Can't do that here. Remember how you had freedom of movement and could go up a ladder then when la puta comes climbing up you kick down the ladder? Can't do that here either. Also enemies are insanely damage spongy and unfun. And have fun with every hit on you being a little cutscene. That don't get old at all.

Anyway, you move on to the castle and the big bads have meeting which metal jesus brought you there for in chains and after an argument the biggest of bads says that metal jesus gets to deal with you and his solution for that is to send a bunch of weredads after you so he destroys the chain holding you down and then... Let's you go... So you run down a whole which is essentially just a ACTION MONTAGE HOLY COW THIS IS SO COOL AMIRITE that consists of you holding down the W key while occasionnaly using the interaction key for a roadblock. And at the end of it is a trap that is just... It has no reason to exist. Now I know REvil has had some silly traps before but I mean  it, this thing literally has no reason to exist at all. It is completely nonsensical for why this contraption exists at all in the space that it does. Again, it is just spectacle.

Finally, Ethan is insufferable to listen to. It's like they asked the writer for his dialogue to write commentary from his perspective on vague things that are happening so they had no idea what to make him actually say and they wouldn't have known what to say anyway cause they're not a writer, it's actually the janitor being asked to write dialogue. Ethan spots a crib in a house ""what is THIS doing HERE!?!?!? O_o"" Oh gee I dunno Ethan MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE THAN YOU HAVE FIGURE OUT THE CONCEPT OF PRODUCING SPAWN!!!!

We want to have it for the sake of having it: The Game.

Story-wise it connects to previous RE games and leading toward RE 9 and has an excellent ending.

Other complains i have is The Mercenaries in RE Village. It's not the same as Mercenaries in RE4, RE5, RE6 as they are about surviving and making score until the time runs out. But in RE Village it's about knowing where the enemies will spawn and killing and keeping combo and run to the next area until the last enemy is killed. The reward for beating all mercenaries stages with SS rank is very weak and unsatisfying for the effort you need to put in to get it.

It's a pretty good game so i highly recommend it to anyone who is new to the series.

Note: the DLCs are for gun cosmetics, RE7 in-game screen effects and starting supplies. So you should only get it for cosmetics reason or supplies, the RE7 handgun isn't worth it.

My experience: 

I got the game because of the Steam Spring sale discount and had heard that the game was pretty fun. I installed it and started the game. The first thing that happened is that it gave me a Capcom popup dialog box asking me to agree to the statement that I needed a codec, but nothing happened prompting me to tell me where to get it or auto-download. The box looked like malware as it resembled something from Windows 3.1 or something. Then, after I clicked OK the game launched in Windowed mode and the game only took up about a quarter of the window. I thought something went wrong so I closed the game. Then I reopened it and it did it again minus the codec box. When it reopened it did the same thing again. I googled the issue and apparently it's a known issue. Really?! Capcom can't release a game that works correctly? Apparently you need to start the game in this weird mode and then adjust the settings to match your system, in 2023, WOW. I don't understand how it can't auto detect like every other game made today does. I went in and fixed all of the settings and got the game working. Major red flag. Then when I go to play the game I could only play for about 25 minutes or so before I got motion sickness.

The experiment capcom did by making a semi-open world game paid off and i can't wait for the sequel especially if it will have similiar gameplay and action, the only 2 things i didn't like much is that ethan does not raise his hand to open doors anymore but instead they just open automatically, also dimitrescu castle and the vampires could have had a much bigger role in the story but unfortunately they didn't last long and were mostly an intro to the game, still, the castle is beautiful and probably the most detailed part of the map.",1620614502,1679189063,True,2,0,0.469696968793869019,0,True,False,False

The Lady Dimitrescu portion that everyone talks about is actually a very comparatively small portion to the rest of the game.

Some of the plot or character interactions don't make sense until the very end of the game, so if you have the patience stick with it. Be careful of flying through the game over screen if you die twice in an area because you can easily lower you difficulty by mistake and not realize it until everything around you is dying much easier.

Story wise I found the game a bit frustrating, there were some odd decisions like making Chris a total dick when he totally owes you an explanation, and dancing around some basic questions that could have been answered earlier. 

The game play its self is very well done, even if it doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel on anything, its a very standard FPS game with some survival horror thrown in. 

Performance wise it plays great. I had most of the important graphic settings either maxed of close to max and the game played without a hitch. The graphic settings also has a nice feature that shows how much Vram you will be using on the graphics card so you can dial in your needs and not crash your system.

Overall it's an enjoyable game, my only fault being that story wise it's a bit obtuse and depends a lot on you finding notes to help fill in the numerous questions you will be asking yourself.",1679126448,1679126448,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In short, this game runs like f*cking butter. Holy sh*t it is so, so smooth. Rock solid 144 FPS in my 3 hours of playing (at the time of this review) and it never dipped once. Not even from gameplay to cutscene transitions (which is typically when FPS dips occur), or even when moving from one area of a map to the next (another common offender of FPS stutters). 

I am nowhere even close to finishing the game but the performance alone gets a thumbs up from me. It's extremely rare I say that in this day and age with all the god awful PC ports constantly being released. I do recall hearing back when this game originally launched that there were performance issues regarding how Denuvo was implemented or something along those lines. So, I came into this game wary and with expectations tempered. Either it was fixed or those FPS drops only affected a small selection of people. Regardless, as it stands this game is unbelievably well optimized. 

I got this game for sale along with RE7 for roughly 60 bucks and that includes the gold edition of both of them. If you were like me and got any of those 2 games on sale, they are an absolutely steal. Yes I recommend Resident Evil: Village, it is fantastic. May or may not come back to update this review when I finish the game but like I mentioned before, the performance is so good it gets a thumbs up from me regardless.

Alright 10 hours later I have finished the main game and everything I wrote before still applies. There were a couple instances where the FPS would dip for a second but those instances were so rare it doesn't matter. It's not like I expect games to run flawlessly 100% of the time without any single hiccups. This game still runs like a dream and is an absolute blast to play. 

In comparison to RE: Biohazard, this game is a little less scary in favour of more action. Not necessarily a bad thing depending on how you view it, but something to think about. I personally didn't mind and found the wide arsenal of guns and the implementation of a shop system quite a fun departure from what was done in 7. 

I really liked how each antagonist had their own area and theme surrounding said area. The game has a village in the middle and surrounding it are 4 areas that each of the lords occupy. Beneviento's was my personal favourite, though it was shorter than I expected. For a roughly 10 hour game there is a surprising amount to do and see. It certainly felt much longer than 10 hours and it's one of those games where it's so good you wish there was more. However, it's easy to miss collectibles and with the game's challenges system, it incentivizes repeat playthroughs.  

On the topic of playthroughs, I finished my first game on standard difficulty. Definitely consider ramping up the difficulty if you're considering doing more playthroughs because at that point you are familiar with the game's systems and layout. I think I can count on one hand how many times I died in this game on my first playthrough. That is certainly a byproduct of the game giving you lots of resources during combat, but it's also a testament to how well the game gives instructions. There's plenty of chase sequences and puzzles to solve where it's not like my ammo or guns would even matter in those scenarios. But the game does an excellent job of nudging you on the right path to take when you're being pursued, or dropping subtle hints when trying to piece together clues to solve a puzzle. 

So I had a very smooth and pleasant experience with this game. Certainly part of it was the abundance of resources, but also the game itself just does a really good job of guiding the player without frustrating them. I could have all the ammo and healing in the world but if I kept dying to some chase sequence or stuck in a room for an hour it would be a very different discussion. None of this is to imply that the game is boringly easy or anything like that, it's just a solid experience all around and it strikes that perfect middle ground of challenging but fair.

In short, Resident Evil: Village is fantastic and I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid to try some survival horror.",1678778805,1678947994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not that it's bad, it's not, it just feels like everything is 'cheaper', then other games in the series. The story is pretty lame, especially after trying to follow up from Res 7, which is a superior game in almost every other way. Res 8 is a beautiful game, but its a AAA release, that's the least it can be! The story borders to much on the supernatural and continues to explore the most vanilla of video game heroes, Ethan Winters. Who is honestly the 'Great Value' version of every generic hero in *insert forgettable action film here*. Res 8 also harbors the worst Mercenaries mode in the series. Okay, it's not a 'bad' game, I can see why people like it, but it just doesn't feel like Resident Evil, to me and that may very well just be a me thing.

At first glance, it would appear that I have sunk a lot of hours into this game, so a part of me must like it right? No. My lengthy play time is due to a couple factors; 1) I have fallen asleep while playing it more then once, and 2) Sometimes Ill just leave it sitting on the menu screen... why? Because, I like to achievement hunt, but every time I load this game up to try and finish it... I have to psyche myself into actually playing it. So it will sit in the menu while I scroll mindlessly on my phone. I maaay finish the achievements, eventually, that's just a compulsorily thing, but I can't help feeling like this is the weakest addition to the series, imo.

Having played Village immediately after completing Resident Evil 7, The Ethan Winters Saga came to a meaningful and satisfying close (albeit with enough unanswered questions to allow the series to continue). 

      From the onslaught, Village's excellent presentation in terms of visuals and audio design is impeccable. Story moments are immersive due to the superb animation, made possible by motion capture technology. Furthermore, Each member apart of the wide cast of characters was performed exceptionally by their respective actors, especially by that of the four lords. Enemy encounters and atmosphere are made far more tense due to the great audio design, allowing for needed tension and horror to build when needed. The variety of environments in which this game takes place in also add to the experience, in areas such as Victorian Castle Dimitrescu, the dilapidated Village, and Heisenberg's underground factory. The level of detail and polish that went into each of the environments by the team at Capcom is phenomenal, made possible by the latest version of the RE engine. 

      Combat this time around, when compared to Resident Evil 7, is the forefront of the experience. The gunplay is satisfying and fairly balanced overall, although continue to expect enemies to act as ""bullet sponges"", a staple of the resident evil franchise. Ammunition and weapon variety is increased considerably over Resident Evil 7, allowing for a more action - oriented experience. As a direct result of this, enemy encounters are less scary this time around, mostly due to the fact that they can be easily disposed of due to the emphasis on combat. Moreover, the jarring nature of many of the enemies found throughout the game also become less tense as the experience progresses, as you will see many of the same enemies due to the lack of variety. This was an issue with Resident Evil 7 as well, although this is a minor gripe. Furthermore, boss encounters are a delight and a considerable leap forward from Resident Evil 7, having mitigated the use of weak points which I find quite basic. Each combat encounter is still fairly streamlined and simple however, allowing for the game to progress at a fairly quick rate. The difficulty can be increased, to the extent of the inclusion of ""Village of Shadows"" which in itself is a much more challenging means to play the game. 

      Post launch content has been a treat as well, due to the likes of ""Shadows of Rose"" DLC, the expansion of the mercenaries mode, VR support, third person perspective, and more. This further adds to the replay value of Village, although this has always been a given for most Resident Evil titles. 

      Overall, I have had an incredible experience with Resident Evil Village and look foward to see what the team at Capcom will continue to with the Resident Evil Franchise! I thoroughly recommend!",1678839787,1678839787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The sound effects are true horror, and you never know whats lurking around the corner :D
And stunning graphic effects. I had to turn off raytracing though even though my RTC2080 Ti supported it but the game kept crashing with it on.

It's a great followup on the Resident Evil 7 ""biohazard"" with a very varying gameplay. Good puzzles and really scary bosses.
I did find that Resident Evil 7 was scarier then this game though. This aimed towars being more of a ""regular"" FPS game.
But i think you really should play RE7 before you start this game, and for the love of god, dont watch any youtube tutorials or trailers it will spoil the fun. Let yourself become immersed of this story!",1678807532,1678807532,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The pacing is pretty spot on for the most part and it was nice to play something on the shorter side. This took me a shade under 9 hours to complete and that was definitely enough. Each time you are about to feel bored there is a change of pace. Some other games could take note!

Game looks great but the HDR seemed to be all over the shop for me anyway. It seemed that no matter how much I monkeyed around with the settings certain parts looked washed out.

Not sure this was worth all the hype and accolades it received but definitely worth checking out.

wtf on dlc

I have had the deluxe then a new winters dlc came out and it atm costs MORE than the game itself
get the core game, skip the dlc
trust me its really not worth it
esp for 30$ usd  one dlc.  Not a season pass, just ONE dlc
ugh 
I there fore cannot recommend this game

one note
this is NOT a RES evil game, 
there is only one mention of umbrella at the end, and its not verbal its a logo on a rock statue
never does this game touch res evil

which is great!
but it should have just been called Village.
not res evil village even with the pun name included  barf resevillage VIII see you barf for that thanks
the game is more a van helsing game which id prefer it to be

just again fair warning on the dlc's
dont get em
esp winter
it has ZERO discount for owners of the full ed
its 30$ 
and its almost nothing in play for that, get a FULL game instead of that one dlc
or get a key.

If you didn't know in Resident Evil 7, Ethan Winter's actually died when he first arrived at the Baker Family estate, when he was fighting his Wife Mia Winter's who has been turned, and controlled by the Mold that Mother Miranda has been experimenting with!  Yes, you heard right, when Jack Baker came from behind Ethan, that stomp to the head actually killed Ethan, but the mold consumed his body and recreated him, which is why Ethan can literally take a beating!

When this game was announced to the Public with Teasers, and Teaser Demo's, we thought Resident Evil 7 was the big deal, no, Resident Evil Village had taken a bigger step forward, and taken all the Graphical design and inspiration from RE4, and turned it into a Hellish Nightmare you won't forget!  This games Visuals are Outstanding!  The first Teaser Trailer we saw, wow, we had no idea what was being made.

I remember finishing off Mother Miranda in that last epic battle, I thought I wasn't gonna be able to finish, but I did it.  Apparently head shots with a sniper rifle do a ton of damage to Mother Miranda, so I just kept shooting her in the head, and I done did IT!

It leans more into action from the beginning than Resident Evil 7 while still having some quality spooky areas. I definitely recommend Village, and it is a great blend of RE4 and RE7.

---DLC---
Shadow of Rose is a nice short 3 hour campaign while adding additional content to the Mercenaries mode. At this point you should probably just be buying the Gold edition so ""should I buy the DLC"" is somewhat irrelevant. It's quality but $17 on sale for essentially just a 3 hour story is a little steep given that I got the base game for $24 which is much more replayable. You do also get a 3rd person camera for the main campaign but I personally didn't have any issues with the first person view.

It's been almost 20 years now Capcom is exploiting these concepts, again and again. To the point that if you played RE4, you played Village as well:

Dirty village? Check
Majestic castle? Check
Modern factory? Check
Boat and giant fish boss? Check
Weapon upgrades? Check
Finding and combining treasures? Check
Shooting chicken for stuff? Check
and the list goes on

All that, to an extent, would not be a problem if Village was a good RE4. It isn't.

1) Setting. It's no secret that RE came to be heavily associated with Raccoon City, Umbrella, and zombies - to the point of everything that came later seen as heresy. That said, RE4's Ganados were pretty much ""zombies with weapons"" so it worked well. However, Village throws in too many stuff that feels like it belongs in a different game - including vampires, werewolves and scary dolls.

2) Combat. There is not much difference to where you shoot anymore, you won't be crippling or disarming your enemies, they merely get staggered every 3rd shot so the combat feels much less nuanced and a step back on the whole. The weapons likewise lack nuance and each new one is simply a straight upgrade over the previous one, even with all the improvements - making the system superficial. 

3) Identity crisis. There are generally two kinds of horror games - in first, you are a weak schoolgirl with no or barely any weapons and the fear factor comes from the fact any engagement might prove fatal; in second, you're a spec ops with a machine gun and you're only ever scared of one thing - running out of ammo. Village tries to be both at the same time, and it doesn't work. The segment where your weapons are taken away and you spend about an hour solving puzzles and hiding in closets from a giant monster feels super disconnected from the rest of the game - the existince of this segment alone is enough to discourage replayability.

4) Pacing. Which is all over the place. It starts slowly, with village itself serving as a prologue/tutorial. The Castle, first actual area, is everything you'd expect from a RE game - action packed, fun puzzles, memorable characters, decent lengh. In contrast, House Beneviento and Reservoir are fairly short and straight to the point. And when you're already tired and are ready to watch the credits, the game throws a lengthy tedious labyrinth called the Factory at you. Imagine if Resident Evi 1/2l's laboratories were longer than the mansion and the police station respectively, and you'll see what I'm getting at. 

5) First person. I only got Village after discovering they added a third person view, but to be honest - it's not good, definitely not what the game was designed for. The Mercenaries mode is still first person only, giving me heavy PS1-era Biohazard Gun Survivor vibes, and that's not a compliment.

TL;DR Village tries to copy RE4's successful formula, but feels underwhelming in the most core aspects and as just a clone in the others.",1678279859,1678279859,False,35,2,0.565858781337738037,0,True,False,False

Its stunning visuals and immersive storyline will keep you hooked from start to finish. The characters are well-crafted, each with their own unique backstory and personality, and the voice acting is top-notch, adding to the overall immersive experience of the game.


The gameplay is a perfect mix of action, exploration, and puzzle-solving that will keep you on your toes. The combat system is smooth and intuitive, making it easy to take down enemies. The exploration aspect of the game is also great, with hidden secrets and items waiting to be uncovered throughout the village. The puzzles are challenging but not overly difficult, adding to the overall enjoyment of the game.


The storyline is one of the standout features of Resident Evil Village. It's engaging, suspenseful, and full of unexpected twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The game also pays homage to previous Resident Evil games, making it a must-play for long-time fans of the series.


The variety of enemies that players face is another great aspect of the game. From werewolves to vampires, each enemy requires a different strategy to defeat, adding to the overall challenge of the game. The boss battles are also well-designed, with each one providing a unique challenge that requires players to use their skills and weapons to their fullest potential.

If you enjoyed [b]Resident Evil 4[/b] and [b]Resident Evil 7 Biohazard[/b], you'll most likely enjoy [b]Resident Evil Village[/b] too. When [b]Capcom[/b] first announced [b]Resident Evil Village[/b], I was both excited and enthusiastic about to play because I'm one of [b]Resident Evil[/b] fan and I love all [b]Resident Evil[/b] games and movies.

The characters in this game are really fantastic and so well done. And the graphics are very detailed and unbelievably good. I was absolutely astounded by how amazing [b]Lady Dimitrescu[/b]’s castle looked in particular, whilst the entire village was hauntingly beautiful. And exploring the village and all the other places in [b]Resident Evil Village[/b] is so exciting and enjoying and the unique twist of having 4 Powerful Lords and [b]Mother Miranda[/b] as the main villain and the [b]Megamycete[/b].

The twist of this game connecting all the [b]Resident Evil[/b] games to it as because the virus and the mold originated in the village is also cool and the rest is for you to find out. First person perspective is also nice yet. I don't know why some players don't like first person perspective. Since [b]Resident Evil 7 Biohazard[/b], some players don't like to play in first person perspective. For me it's really perfect with that type of horror game.

Weapons, combat and fights are also well made and worth it. The merchant named [b]The Duke[/b] is also really helpful and has more options. The enemies are more unique and had their own abilities and difficulties than [b]Resident Evil 7 Biohazard[/b] or some other [b]Resident Evil[/b] games. The gameplay was similar to [b]Resident Evil 7 Biohazard[/b] but [b]Resident Evil Village[/b] added a lots more customizations.

The boss fights are also amazing and having more boss fights than [b]Resident Evil 7 Biohazard[/b] and it's also strangely a bit easy to beat. The puzzles are also unique and vary in different special ways. But can be straightforward and easy to hint though.

The scares and horrors also are both terrifying and awesome, with unexpected jump scares, adrenaline, and the horrific aura while exploring, never knowing what, when, where or how it will happen. The idea of making this a survival horror game is nice yet overly focused. The depth and information behind all characters are well described and shown here, especially for [b]Ethan Winters[/b], [b]Lady Dimitrescu[/b], [b]Mother Miranda[/b] and some but some are still missing and left for the next game or for us to find.

The Mercenaries mode and the other gameplay modes is also cool and even having the models of each character, items and enemies in the game which you can buy is also a good concept. The music and soundtracks in this game are really unique and awesome. The story concept for the intro and credits is also unique and I feels I got [b]Tim Burton[/b] and [b]Coraline[/b] vibes from it.

The cutscenes and acts are really pretty amazing. And all the items, treasures, weapons and crafted products are all still goodly unique. And the gameplay feels a lot smoother too. The optimization is good enough on the launch day and no bugs or anything while playing.

And The voice actors also did a great job and the story, plots and overall are amazingly good and memorable. For me, honestly [b]Resident Evil Village[/b] is one of the best survival horror game with amazing story. I absolute recommend for players who like to play horror games with amazing story. I believe that everyone should play this amazing horror game with good storyline.

Thank You :)

It uses horror as a theme and to spice up the pacing, but this is action heavy Resident Evil made today and made well. Playing it on Hardcore make me finish multiple bossfights on my last magazine of ammunition. Learning the dance of combat with Ethan's loadout and blocking mechanic felt like what 7's gameplay always wanted to become. The story is back to being batshit insane half the time, and desperately trying to be a corny, but amazing, action movie. Which is weird, because I think Resident Evil is better at being an action movie than anything I've seen at a theater.

I loved how fast this game moved through it's setpieces, and how the opening immediately beats the shit out of you to establish that action focus. How the early game plays compared to the late game is the most Resident Evil progression imaginable.

Spoilers below:

[spoiler] Chris Redfield in this game is the best rendition of him there is. His section finally bringing back that late 4 and 5 action is probably very surprising to people who have only came from 7, but this game really ties everything into the Chris Redfield side of Resident Evil. He is still kinda dumb and blunt as he should be, but it seems like the extra layer of intimidation and efficiency is where he would realistically be in the canon at this point. Steamrolling everything that gave Ethan trouble with a tricked out AK and a squad that blows every recent Tom Clancy game out of the water in cool factor is perfectly Chris. [/spoiler]


This game does tie into the greater Resident Evil lore, and you will be sort of confused about who Chris Redfield is without the previous knowledge of the games. If you haven't played 7, then you are missing an even bigger chunk. This is a direct sequel to 7 if you didn't figure that out yet.

But still, especially from a gameplay standpoint, this does kind of stand on its own if you get accustomed to the suspension of disbelief that RE asks of you quickly. Holy fuck, is this a well put together, good looking, good playing, and fun video game. I've started using the newer Resident Evil games as a view into the lost future of AAA games being actually good, and I will continue to do so.

There are some big issues with the plot and some rough spots in the writing, but that's nothing new for the franchise.",1678069195,1678209311,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil Village is a wonderful survival horror adventure game that includes shooting, exploration, puzzles and inventory management.
Most of the action takes place in an isolated village in Eastern Europe, in Romania, but you will also visit a beautiful castle, a house of horror, a water reservoir, a metal factory and more.
The characters look amazing and boss-fights are exciting, my favourite is probably a fight against Moreau.
The music and graphics are really nice, the game is also well optimized.
The story can be a bit confusing but you will figure it all out in the end, especially if you don't skip the lore files.

Resident Evil Village exceeded my expectations and provided a fun and thrilling experience.

Other than that the game play is pretty good and the level designs are unique. The DLC was a fantastic addition where you get to play as Ethan's daughter and her play style is refreshing and in 3rd person. The DLC also included the 3rd person mode for the original game as well. The game is optimized to get the most out of your GPU and the graphics menu lets you see the changes based on the graphical options you select but I didn't see a benchmark test option in there. I give the game an 8/10 it lost 2 points with info unnecessarily withheld from your main character and because this game had a few missed opportunities to be scarier. RE7 had lots more scarier moments than this game in my opinion. All in all it's a great buy.,1678090396,1678090396,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tragedy has occurred in this the once peaceful town in the middle of nowhere.  

Game is confusing, does it want me to play or just hang out in the castle?, One man stated. Currently prime suspect for killing all four ladies that live in the castle. 

 In other news, local town with a fair share of problems:

1. Women killed violently in her home by intruders ( later it was determined to be mistaken identity). 
2. Couple's kid was kidnapped. ( After crazy man hunt, lost of a father, child was returned to mother).
3. Vehicle explodes on the way to the village. (man wanders in heavy snow for hours) 
4. Local dogs terrorize village (big one suspected to be the leader). 
5. Doll maker brutally stabbed to death in her home. (Drugs appear to be a factor, no weapons found) 
6. local swamp was drained to kill infected fish. 
7. Factory under investigation for human trafficking. 
8. A robot death match, followed up by surprise guess (the locals really enjoyed this).

The game and combat is really fun. I wish some of the boss fights had some more work put into them as it is just shoot them as much as you can there isnt really any strategy. Lady Ds section was by far the best which was a bit of a let down as its the first in the game so the rest just feels a bit lacklustre compared to it.
Atmosphere is great, story and characters are pretty interesting, the main village concept is really well executed and the whole vibe of the game is tense, especially on the higher difficulties where healing and ammo is scarce and enemies hit like a truck and can come out of no where.

This game is a masterclass in horror, from the tense atmosphere to the grotesque enemies that players face throughout the game.

One of the most impressive things about Resident Evil 7 is how it manages to balance horror with action. It's not just about shooting enemies, but also about exploring the environment, solving puzzles, and uncovering the dark secrets of the game's story. The pacing is perfect, with moments of intense action interspersed with quieter moments that allow players to catch their breath and take in the eerie atmosphere.

The graphics in Resident Evil 7 are stunning, and the game's attention to detail is truly impressive. The environment is richly detailed, and the character models are both realistic and terrifying. The game's sound design is also exceptional, with every creak and groan of the dilapidated mansion adding to the overall sense of dread and unease.

Another thing that makes Resident Evil 7 so great is its focus on exploration. There are plenty of secrets to uncover in the game, and players are rewarded for taking their time and thoroughly exploring each area. This gives the game a real sense of depth and replayability, as players will want to revisit certain areas to uncover every last secret.

Overall, Resident Evil 7 is an amazing game that showcases the direction that the Resident Evil franchise should be heading in. The game's first-person perspective adds a level of immersion that was missing in the previous games, and the horror and action elements are perfectly balanced.

But the lack of an FOV slider is a massive step back for the franchise in terms of accessibility and player experience. I had to download a third-party tool (which breaks the sniper scope zoom-in btw) to avoid getting motion sickness. Apparently there used to be a fully functioning mod for fixing the FOV, but the game has since been patched and this no longer works.

Aside from the FOV issue, there are a few other things that just scream rushed PC port to me. Weird default key mapping. Awkward map/inspect controls. Clumsy inventory management. It is glaringly obvious that the game was built with controllers in mind and keyboard controls were a complete afterthought.

Prelude:
Although RE:2 and the RE remake for Dreamcast are my favourite REs, Resident Evil 7 blew me away. 
The horror was real, the jumpscares were perfectly placed, and the story was great. At first I really disliked the setting, but after 1 hour, I was hooked and loved every minute (except Mia, I just hate Mia. She is a borderline stereotype and I wouldn't be surprised if she was a cheerleader in High School. Still liked her chapter in RE 7, though, storywise). 

Now, let's get to RE Village.

Pro:
- Combined with the amazing RE 7 (which was better for me) it gives you one of the best storylines in the RE universe
- The ending surprises and breaks your heart at the same time.
- The scenery and landscape is eye pleasing and has a lot of different settings
- The graphics overall look great
- There are a lot of secrets to discover, and you will happily hunt down every one, because it will boost your dmg output by a LOT
- The game is hard (I like difficult games)
- The gameplay feels good, although running (especially away from enemies) feels a bit clunky.
- The upgradable weapons and abilities made me search every possible secret location. Worth it!

Cons:
- The game is hard. Even though I like difficult games, at certain points, the enemies are down right bullet sponges just for the sake of it.
- Lazy enemy design at some points througout the game (see above).
- Mia
- The game is less horror and more shooter, which I dislike. I love RE for the horror, not for 360 noscope lycans
- The enemies were too much fantasy for me. Werewolfs, giants, teleporting vampires. It was all a little bit too far away from beeing explainable with a ""virus"" or ""mold"". 
- Some bossfights are just annoying, at least on hard (Bullet sponge problem).

Verdict:
Overall I have to say that RE 8 is worse than RE 7 for me. RE 7 was way more horrifying than RE 8. Nevertheless, the game was still very fun to play through and, well, the ending was such a blast.",1677971417,1677971417,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

With the success of Resident Evil 7 Biohazard, a upcoming sequel was practically guaranteed. Resident Evil Village continues the survival horror line of recent Resident Evil games by combining the survival horror properties of RE7 with fast paced aspects taken from RE4 to make this a critically successful title in the franchise.

[u]Story + Characters (Possible Spoilers!)[/u]

[spoiler]The story of Resident Evil Village takes place a little over three years after the events of RE7 and is set in Romania. Ethan and his family were relocated under Chris' orders to protect their existence from the public (and unsavory organizations) after the events of RE7, but when Mia is killed by Chris and Rosemary, Ethan's infant daughter, is kidnapped, his chase leads to a nearby deserted village where Ethan's search begins.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]I found much of the story's structure well-constructed and interesting thanks to Ethan's individuality as a more fleshed out character instead of the self-insert image he held in RE7 and the neopagan cult that was prominent within the village. Ethan is a much more relatable and compelling character in which he is basically the best father ever and is also more composed for someone who has faced BOWs already. The village in relation to the cult is an idea that goes as far back as RE4 and it does okay here, although not much is done with it outside of some files and one cutscene with the last remaining human villagers.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]For other characters, they're all great but I think they could have been given more screentime. For example, the Four Lords: Lady D, Donna, Moreau, and Heisenberg. Outside of one scene, they never make contact with each other ever again and are exclusively tied to their respective set pieces. I was expecting Lady D to be more of an overall threat through the game due to how much trailer time she got, but she's done and over with after the Castle section. It's the same case for the other lords (Donna and Moreau especially). Miranda is the most obvious one with this issue; outside the one scene you see her along with the Four Lords, Ethan and Miranda never have encounters with each other until near the end of the game - hell, Ethan barely acknowledges her existence until she actually appears before him as Mia after killing Heisenberg. As for Chris, I was already not buying the possible heel turn from the most iconic RE character into a villain when the trailers came out and of course, the subversion was there. I'm all up for seeing Chris, but there were times where I felt like there was no reason for him [b]not[/b] to explain everything to Ethan early on or to act hostile towards him so it just feels contrived.[/spoiler]

[u]Gameplay[/u]

The gameplay is similar to RE7 except it's now built for much faster pacing. There are more enemies thrown at you, albeit with more ammo drops, you're given a lot more leeway to your movement, and you can now push back enemies after you successfully block their attacks. There are set pieces here like the first village fight which reference parts of RE4 that are still fun and challenging to play through. Monsters range from Lycans to the Cadou-powered Soldats in the Factory, but it's too bad some of the enemies are derived from the common enemy type in terms of design. Despite its similarity to RE7, it's still a very solid and enjoyable gameplay system.

The map is a wide arrangement of different settings that never feel too similar from each other. There's the widely explorable Village, the Gothic-styled Castle, the Beneviento Manor, and more varieties of places to progress towards. The levels are designed different aesthetically and mechanically so you'll have different tastes to the gameplay as you continue forward. It does, however, stagnate near the end when you enter the Factory. And yes, horror is still present in this game despite the added action aspects: [spoiler]The gameplay segment with ""Baby"" kept me in an anxious state for a few days...[/spoiler]

Weapons are a lot more varied now with different handguns, shotguns, magnums, proximity mines, and more. The inventory system is similar to RE4's too: an attache case system where items are organized by tiles. Ammo is common, but still should be managed due to the increased enemy count. There's a treasure system where you can collect treasures (and sometimes combine them) to sell them to Duke, the Merchant character of this game. You can buy a variety of items from ammo to modifications for your guns from Duke and even give him ingredients for food recipes which can give benefits like increase your maximum health or make you run faster.

[u]Graphics & Sound[/u]

Resident Evil games in the RE engine still look as great as ever. In fact, I'd say it's getting better as time goes on. Many of the background graphics in lightly lit places like the Castle or the Manor are exquisite. Flashlights shining dimly in dark areas are always a tense moment and really bring out the refined lighting and shadow effects in this game.

The sounds are quite crisp and clean. Each enemy has their own sound cues to assist you in detecting them and the soundtrack for Resident Evil Village overall adds a lot to the tone of Gothic and eldritch horror already shown through the atmosphere the game gives off.

[u]Conclusion[/u]

Aside from a few issues I have with the flow of the story, I found myself satisfied with the time I spent playing Resident Evil Village. Even with the minor negative points I've noted, this game is still a solid addition to the series. The combined gameplay mechanics from RE7 and RE4, the extended exploration, and the added Winters' Expansion DLC makes this game an enjoyable experience with high replayability. 

Recommended for all players who enjoy survival horror with some action sprinkled in.

9/10.

Hate chem fluid. Wish they'd do away with it. Nothing wrong with the Herb system. At least they were creative with RE4 and introduced yellow herbs.

I've played all there games many times. Easily thousands of hours invested, so I'm going to be a very harsh critic when it comes to games I care about.  Resident Evil Village is going to receive that same treatment. I've read the reviews both good and bad and finished the game. I'm now ready to jump into my pros and cons list. 

Pros:
 * Game looks gorgeous, environments are exciting. You visit lots of locations, you aren't stuck in a village like the title implies. 
* RE8 is a mix of RE7 and RE4, both solid games in the franchise. There's no item box, you buy and sell items to a vendor. You have plenty of item space on your person and it's up-gradable. (Also a con) 
* Lots of different weapons to find, to buy or unlock with many different upgrades for each weapon
* You can craft things: health, ammo and other goodies 
* Ethan is back from RE7 and he's a very likable character, he makes a great protagonist because he behaves like a normal human being would given the situations he's put in over and over again
* The main story is more lengthy then I was expecting, I think it's a couple hours longer than RE7, but that's because there is a lot more to find in RE8 (the length is also going to show up in the cons too)
* Treasures are back, just like 4 and 5, I can't remember if RE6 had treasures (who cares that was garbage game anyway) remember some treasures can be combined and they sell for significantly more, always check each item before selling
* A wide variety of enemies and there is also a minor animal hunting aspect to the game (you'll collect meat from them)

Cons:
* Honestly, not a fan of the story. I see how they tied it in to the rest of the RE Universe but pretty uninspiring I thought 
* As far the story goes, who on Earth can keep track of what villains or evil corporations are doing what, and how they relate to the rest of the universe. We started with the T-Virus and Umbrella (game release chronologically) and now we have black mold and good corporations turning bad and bad ones turning good. Children are infected, children are important, children are evil. I don't know, we just keep getting the same damn rehashed stories! 
* I did mention length as pro, but it's also a con. I think the game went on for about 2 hours too long. The first several hours of the game was a ton of fun but then near the half way point I was ready for it to be over and the last couple of hours I hated. It brought me back to the nightmares of playing RE6. WAY WAY WAAAAY to action oriented. [spoiler] Seriously, just F*** the whole factory part, I hate the cyborg BS or whatever you want to call those enemies. [/spoiler] 
* As I just mentioned the first few hours of RE8 is great, but this game completely lost touch with what made RE so awesome. It was scary, there was tension being built through excellent story telling and the use of unique cinematography. Simply put, RE8 runs out of gas and does the old let's just throw all this stupid shit at the player and see what sticks. It lost it's survival horror feel quickly.  
* I remember when RE had only zombies, or zombified creatures. Now we have [spoiler] werewolves, vampires and paranormal shit [/spoiler] It doesn't really feel like RE anymore. 
* They did Ethan dirty SPOILER INCOMING [spoiler] he was basically made of mold, because he was killed at the beginning of RE7 so he went for several years and never knew that? Even had a child?! WHAT?! That's the big deal of RE8?! That's shit story telling! [/spoiler]
* There is zero point to inventory management, you can craft things whenever and the crafting materials don't take up inventory slots. It's easy to save on space so I ask you why bother removing the item box when you never run out of room in the first place? They took that idea from RE4 for zero reason, because it truly has no effect on how you play. 
* Interacting with enemies other than shooting them is pretty dull. There are very few times where you can shoot environmental items so they effect enemies. Even shooting different body parts doesn't hinder or play any effect on them. A lot of the enemy interactions are seriously subpar compared to other RE titles. 

I could list a few more things on the cons list, but I think everyone is getting the gist of my review. It's not good, it's not the worst RE game but it's not in the top 3 like many people are saying it is. FYI, so you understand my standards, I'd say the pinnacle of the RE Universe is RE2 Remake (as of the time of this review). It got so many things right and arguably did it better than the original. With that being said, I can't give RE8 a free pass because it did several things right. I have to look at both sides of the coin. Was this game a step forward or a step backward?

I played this game multiple times through to truly experience resident evil 8 and I gotta say after Resident evil 7 they really fumbled the bag... RE7 was able to evolve the franchise but keep the heart of a Resident Evil while adding new life to the series. It was such a welcomed breathe of fresh air that the series and well the genre itself needed as RE7 single handedly revitalized the survival horror genre. not horror. SURVIVAL HORROR. It was universally praised by the most hardcore fans and casual crowd. they had the blueprint to really not only improve on what they built with RE7 to make a better experience... but even if they didnt do that and it was more or less the same with a little quality of life and a few changes it woulda been still great. but nah we got something that was watered down, linear, and very repetitive.. that tried to bite off things it didn't need to even chew... It's like editing a recipe that was complete. delicious, and highly praised by food critics and everyday people to then just throwing random other bs ingredients like example raisins in chicken noodle soup and blending it and calling it a better dish giving it the sequel/succesor title.... I'm not going to cover all the downfalls as many other reviews have. Resident evil 8 is what happens when you have lightning in a bottle that is readily available and can easily be produced more of  but instead they decide to intentionally empty that bottle till there wasn't a drop left. here's hoping that whatever 9 is that it's atleast better than 8.

Oh and don't get me even started on the fact that even if you bought the collectors or deluxe edition you still HAD to buy the long awaited mediocre $20 DLC that utilized a ton of re used assets and same areas you played in the main game... if you haven't played the DLC don't bother it wil not affect your outlook on the game or it's story. 

SPOILER 

it was all just a lame prequel to the main game's ending so if you wanted any answers to anything you don't really get any. all you get to know is for whatever reason they put rose in public school and she was bullied that's all you get from her was that she was bullied.
you don't get to know about who she actually is, her relationship with mia or more stuff of mia, nothing about her and chris, etc. and you could predict the events of the DLC From a mile away.. I had a huge hunch we were just going to re fight miranda with all the re used stuff.. and that obviously the cheesy michael thing was going to be ethan and that for whatever reason shes going to keep her powers whether to save someone or she learns to love her powers or some bs lol... somehow they made rose feel janky compared to ethan. 

Unless someone gifts this to you or you get a product key for a few bucks off of you know... don't waste your hard earned money here It wasn't worth the $60-70 on launch and it's not worth the $40 it is going for right now.",1674975205,1677619415,False,3,0,0.527251780033111572,0,True,False,False

The setting, events, and the Duke merchant. I would argue the shop is even better here, as you can buy ammo and far more attachments than in 4. Resident Evil 4 had some bullshit sections, like the fights with the blind wolverine guys. This game has FAR less bullshit. I'd say the only bullshit in this game would be Lady D chasing you around the castle, because on a first playthrough you're gonna get lost in there, and it can be annoying finding where to go while being stalked by her nonstop. Aside from that, game has no bullshit. The section in the doll estate with the giant baby monster was a little tedious, as you're defenseless against a monster that one hit kills you. It was my only death on the first playthru, which is a good thing. Shows the game is less cheap/bullshit. 

The guns in the game have fantastic sound design. Whether it's firing, reloading, or switching weapons, it's some of the best I've heard. A good selection of weapons, with 3 pistols and shotguns, with lots more to play around with. I love packing heat in this game. You feel like a badass, but at the same time can be threatened by almost every encounter. When you hit enemies, they react unless they're in the middle of an attack animation on top of you. This is great. 

The game, however, did get quite easy after clearing the doll estate. You get so much firepower that if you play your cards right, you'll rarely get hit. It's fun to annihilate monsters after being a weakling at the beginning, but after not getting hit for 2 hours, it did click that this is kinda easy. Maybe Standard is too easy? 

Length and variety of the game is decent. I'd say it's worth full price, and new game plus is (almost) always fantastic in Resident Evil games. My weapon of choice was the Sniper Rifle, and I'm sure there's one for everyone to enjoy creaming monsters with. :)",1677552201,1677552201,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Game and it's story is something new and fresh in RE world, but it is also well integrated with the rest of franchise. I was really worried about how will they connect the story to the original RE, but they did it very smoothly. Graphics are beautiful, soundtracks are just WOW, bosses are so well designed and for some reason you connect with them on so many levels that you are sad once you kill them. 
I only wish it was longer, since I managed to finish it under 12 hours in my first play through (and I'm the slow type of player, who likes to take time and explore) and each next time It was even shorter. Come on Capcom - make it longer, we know you can do it. DLC story is a nice addition, but it can't compensate main game's shortness, since DLC is a bit short too and uses a lot of assets from the main game (like 99% of it).
All in all this game is a gem and I could not recommend it more for everyone that would enjoy that twisted but enchanting horror fairytale vibe.",1637855758,1677451572,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil Village is a wonderful survival horror adventure game that includes shooting, exploration, puzzles and inventory management.
Most of the action takes place in an isolated village in Eastern Europe, in Romania, but you will also visit a beautiful castle, a house of horror, a water reservoir, a metal factory and more.
The characters look amazing and bossfights are exciting, my favourite is probably a fight against Moreau.
The music and graphics are really nice, the game is also well optimised, I had zero issues while playing it.
The story can be a bit confusing but you will figure it all out in the end, especially if you don't skip the lore files.

Resident Evil Village exceeded my expectations and provided a fun and thrilling experience.

From the opening moments where you're chased by a giant werewolf with a thirst for blood, to the final boss battle against an eight-foot-tall vampire lady, this game is full of moments that'll make you say, 'What the hell is going on?'

But don't worry, you won't be alone in your confusion. You'll have Ethan Winters, the game's protagonist, to guide you through this nightmare. And by 'guide you through', I mean stumble around blindly while muttering to himself and getting his hands chopped off for the fifth time. Seriously, if Ethan Winters is the only hope for humanity, we're all screwed.

The real stars of the show, though, are the game's villains. You've got Lady Dimitrescu, the aforementioned eight-foot-tall vampire lady who could crush you like a grape but instead wants to seduce you (hey, whatever floats your boat, Lady D). Then there's Heisenberg, a guy who's basically Walter White if Walter White was a mad scientist with a metal arm. And let's not forget the dollhouse, which is... well, let's just say it's a whole thing.

As for the gameplay, it's your standard Resident Evil fare - lots of exploring creepy environments, solving puzzles, and fighting off hordes of monsters with limited resources. But Village amps up the tension by constantly putting you in tight spaces with enemies that can jump out at you from any angle. And if that's not scary enough for you, there's a mode where you can play the entire game in VR. Because who needs sleep anyway?

All in all, Resident Evil Village is a wild ride that's sure to leave you with more questions than answers. But hey, at least you'll have Lady Dimitrescu to keep you company in your nightmares. Just don't expect her to cuddle with you. Unless you're into that kind of thing.",1677089315,1677089315,True,0,1,0.474683523178100586,0,True,False,False

Every part of this game was unique and really well done. Every weapon was great, every enemy was great and each stage had it's own feeling. From suspense, to action, to pure horror and many more.

Graphics - Breathtaking graphics, state of the art, and to complement this, the game is very well optimized compared to game like the dead space remake.

Pros - great setting, fun and addicting game play, decent story, the villains are super cool and it has a very scary portion similar to pt, the way the village opens up after moreaus section is so cool and all the different areas and treasures you could find made it feel important to explore every area, finding hidden caves and little catacombs around the village was super cool and I hope they add stuff like that to the re4 remake maybe.

Cons - While this game is fantastic, I do think it's gotten a bit worse as its aged, some sections feel very linear while others make you feel like there is so much to explore and so much treasure to find, the only weak part of this game is moreaus section, which is short.",1676852421,1676852421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has an old, silent film horror theme and looks like it takes place in a Nosferatu movie. The orange-yellow aesthetic is legendary, just a beautiful game in general. It can be buggy though, there have been multiple times where I used an explosive for it to not damage my opponent at all. I even got to skip an entire huge fight with the lycans because they simply didn't spawn. It was funny to run around a boss room where the giant werewolf guy never appeared. Playing on standard difficulty, the level of challenge is just perfect; not too hard, not too easy. The puzzles are pretty cool as well and could get hard at times.

The RE Engine is fluid as it's been since RE7, RE2 and RE3, The weapon upgrade system never leaves you feeling like your weapons are under-powered, the map is fairly large with lots of treasures and items to find, the enemies feel very threatening when you first encounter them, but the weapon upgrades make this a very temporary feeling. Two things I really don't like, the only two things, is that they reuse Ethan as the protagonist, which doesn't feel very Resident Evil of them. Also, there are times when the settings make it feel more like Silent Hill than Resident Evil.

This beautiful fusion makes this one of the best feeling games to play in the Resident Evil franchise. It is, of course, not without faults: moving items in the inventory is tedious, the normal enemies all have a stunlock that takes forever to end, and the defend key is not that useful- especially on higher difficulties. The post-game rewards are also lackluster and the mercenaries mode is a complete grind. You can argue a lot of these are growing pains as the series evolves and finds it's comfortable medium, or say that I am nitpicking, but hey, YMMV.

[b]However[/b], despite all this, the game absolutely shines. The story is compelling, the environment rich and bone-chilling no matter where you go, the incredibly crisp and smooth graphics that are highly-optimized and the animations and transitions are smooth as butter. Everything you would expect from a AAA game and more. Have I mentioned the combat? What is a Resident Evil game without satisfying zombie (or in this case, lycan) destruction, as well as challenging & creative boss fights? There is no shortage of either action or horror in this entry and I couldn't be happier with how it plays out. I could go on, but I don't think it's necessary. Final verdict is this:

If you're on the fence, wait for a sale. I mean, you've waited this long, right?

But if you're a Resident Evil fan, or a survival horror games fan in general, chances are [i]you already have this game.[/i] 9/10 would most definitely recommend.",1676607701,1676607701,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hated how stupid and ugly is Mia, Felt sorry for Moreau, but liked Dimitrescu most.  
They should make a prequel where the dull story of Dimitrescu and her daughters would be told with the castle and the village, but also the story of Luiza and her house. I would also add some Romanian folk music

It's not my personal favorite of the series but it does continue to broaden and expand the RE lore and legacy set by two plus decades of stories in other titles within the series. Combat is definitely faster paced leaning more towards a DOOM like experience with quick weapon swapping and fast movement to avoid enemy attacks. 

Visually the RE Engine is at its' best with some of the most gorgeous looking environments and character models the series has ever produced. The story and pacing are again, a mixed bag with some scenarios and locations being more interesting and fun than others. Your mileage will vary depending on what you expect out of this one. It's not straight up survival horror like the older titles or 7, but it's also not full blown action like RE 4 or 5. It manages to find a sweet spot in the middle and it works for the most part.

Recommend dialing down most shadow options, moving to medium-high for mesh/model and lighting options and turning off Ray tracing and vertical sync to start. Also turn off most of the options below Ray tracing (ambient occlusion, water effects, film grain). If walking around Ethan's home in the opening section you still feel like the game is chugging, turn the settings down further. You don't need to tweak things to get them perfect at this point just get it to a state where you feel good with the quality then resume the first leg of the game, enjoy the craziness and get to the first typewriter save point. Stop at this point then do further tweaking after you save your progress, to hone in the settings before continuing.

If you're not familiar with the impact the settings each will have just go one by one until you have the best settings for your rig and try to get all of those settings settled on before continuing any further past that first typewriter checkpoint. Be sure to test outside and run a little once you are dialed in graphically.

I think a big performance increase can come if you use Oculus in the Oculus diagnostics tool and the resolution, I brought my resolution down a bit and hertz refresh to 72, I have an older I7 and an AMD RX 6800 XT.

Once you are done finding the best setting for you, enjoy getting stepped on by the good Lady.",1676437900,1676437900,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After finally finishing this game, I can understand why it has an overwhelming positive review score out of nearly 60K Steam reviews.

This is the true sequel from a design point to Resident Evil 4. Another masterpiece in the series. This review will only encompass the base campaign, not the DLC or other content. *3RD-Person Mode Used*
---

Graphics - 9/10 || The most up-to-date version of the RE Engine really shines on modern hardware. The game is absolutely gorgeous, and the lighting in particular this engine has to offer helps to create the most immersive survival-horror experience yet.

Performance - 9/10 || Runs extremely well as the engine is very, very optimized. I managed to crank the settings to the brink and use Ultra Quality mode AMD FSR and my frames stayed locked at 120FPS for most of the playthrough, with some minor spikes here and there during action intensive scenes. There were a couple spots on the map that weren't optimized and the FPS took massive drops all of twice during the playthrough.

Not a single game-breaking bug or crash for the entirety of the time I played.

i7-6800K 4.0G OC'd
32G DDR4
1080 STRIX

Gameplay - 10/10 || This takes the formula that RE4 established and perfects it. The absolute master-class level design helps to almost immediately immerse you with an overwhelming sense of dread and tension for nearly the entire playthrough. The game is extremely challenging and will demand a lot of you throughout the various experiences crafted that it has to offer you. Overcoming each section is extremely rewarding and satisfying. It will push your skills to the absolute limits.

Easily the best boss-fights of any Resident Evil game to date, hands down, and arguably the best part of the game.

It's a roller-coaster ride that barely lets you breathe.

Story - 9/10 || A direct continuation from RE7, with some nice surprises sprinkled in, ESP. during the climax of the game. CAPCOM manages to take various horror tropes and crafts them into a unique experience. This will make more sense once you figure out whats causing all the madness and hell around you to be unleashed.

*Spoilers*

In this game, you got;

Vampires
Dolls
Warewolves
Body-Horror (Cronenburg level stuff.)
KANEDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ~~~~~~~~~~ TETSUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Sound - 10/10 || This game demands to be played with high-quality audio. Every sound effect, growl, ambient or musical note is crafted with intent and is stellar. Arguably the best audio in any Resident Evil game to date.

Controls - 9/10 || The formula that REmake-2 established is here to stay. Playing with mouse/keyboard feels effortless. Movement is snappy and precise, along with the aiming. Which you'll need - enemies in this game are -not- easy to dispatch and the more ammo you waste, the worse time you're going to have. Things will spiral out of control very quickly.

Replay Value - High || DLC, Mercs, and a vast CP store for unlocks will keep you playing this for quite sometime. I'm going to do the DLC campaign soon and will touch on Mercs. I'd imagine the campaign is pretty enjoyable with infinite ammo like the previous games.

In closing, CAPCOM did it again. They managed to push this medium forward and the franchise keeps getting better and better.

I absolutely cannot wait for REmake-4.

Resident Evil Villllllllllillllilllllllage is what happens when a committee meets and decides to make a sequel by trying to smash together the best bits of two of the best entries in a series and hope it makes an even better game. In short; it don't. I can't help but feel that this was originally going to be a whole different game (i.e. Not Resident Evil) then Capcom got hold of it, chucked Ethan Winters into it, and made it a sequel that never needed to happen.

I cannot fault the visuals, level design or gameplay of this game. It looks stunning and the world feels realistic and lived in.

HOWEVER none of it makes any flipping sense. I KNOW its not meant to be realistic, but it doesn't even make sense in it's own slightly bonkers universe. I've played it through and still cant really explain the plot, or why anything is happening, or who anyone is supposed to be anymore.

RE7, and before it RE4, were great because they changed up a tired and increasingly cliched format. RE4 knew not to take itself too seriously and was fun, scary and challenging. RE7 got (slightly) more serious, at least until the end, and was a pretty horrifying experience. You know whats not scary? Being able to craft your own ammunition from scrap metal and chemical fluid. Or having various parts of your body impaled, removed or mutilated and having it not impact your ability to perform tasks in the slightest. Again; this worked in RE7, but it just feels silly now.

Remember zombies? Zombies were pretty important in RE games. Now we have werewolves and vampires and....zombie vampires or something. Again, this would be fine if it actually made any sense in the context of the world, but it doesn't. The designers obviously realised this and just gave up making any attempt to explain it beyond ""umm umm mould or something"". And don't get me started on Chris F-ing Redfield.

In summary: too short, too mad and not very challenging or scary. But hey, go play it. Its Resident Evil! Apparently.",1675976533,1675976533,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Regretfully, this is not the 'Resident Evil' experience you would want and this is more of the action-oriented gameplay that you would expect from RE 4. The problem this game has is wanting to be RE 7 still, but its immediately watered down and not much of a puzzle or make you have to make a lot of decisions. Its all been watered down since the last RE 7. 

That was what made RE 7 great, was the actual survival horror aspect and then having that sweet revenge when you get the unlocks after the game. In this, that feeling is missing and its not even rewarding in that regard as you wont struggle in this game. It is too easy by throwing only a handful of enemies, or to ""Make it harder"" they just throw a mob at you to try and make it harder. Its not harder, its silly and not what you would want in a RE title. This really does feel like the RE 2 remaster and RE 3 remaster comparison to quality of titles. except it is RE 7 with RE 8, and it really does show.

It is so slow and boring. Enemies move slowly and you are encouraged to abuse furniture to make enemies walk around like idiots. The game is also constantly taking away control from the player and making them watch some slow animation like looking at blood on your hand, or flipping a switch, or turning a crank. There are also a ton of scripted sections and/or cutscenes, and skipping them is painful because it does the crap where you can't open the pause menu to skip until you are several seconds into the cutscene (probably cause loading or something). It just overall feels like a massive slog to play through.

The game is nonsensical. The story is always ridiculous in RE games, but RE8 just doesn't strike the right tone. It isn't campy. It isn't scary. I just found it dumb and I don't care about it whatsoever. Heisenberg and the Duke were decent, but I hated all the other characters. It has a lot of gore and is intending to be shocking, but the gore is so over-the-top and non-stop that it is often more comically bad than anything else. Why would I be scared of this enemy in front of me when I just survived multiple fatal wounds in the cutscene 5 seconds ago? The amount of gore goes way too far and has a very negative effect for what the game is going for.

Here are some games on Steam in the same genre I would recommend over RE8:
- Resident Evil 2 (remake)
- Resident Evil 3 (remake)
- Resident Evil 4
- Resident Evil 5
- Resident Evil 6
- Resident Evil Revelations 2
- Ghostbusters Remastered
- Dead Space
- Last of Us

Here are some additional Steam recommendations over RE8, but these are farther away from RE8's genre:
- Control 
- Tomb Raider (modern Square Enix Trilogy)
- Uncharted
- Vanquish",1675721559,1675721671,False,2,0,0.441841006278991699,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil Village is a wonderful survival horror adventure game that includes shooting, exploration, puzzles and inventory management.
Most of the action takes place in an isolated village in Eastern Europe, in Romania, but you will also visit a beautiful castle, a house of horror, a water reservoir, a metal factory and more.
The characters look amazing and bossfights are exciting, my favourite is probably a fight against Moreau.
The music and graphics are really nice, the game is also well optimised, I had zero issues while playing it.
The story can be a bit confusing but you will figure it all out in the end, especially if you don't skip the lore files.

Resident Evil Village exceeded my expectations and provided a fun and thrilling experience.

With unnerving precison, the game's realism hit me at every turn. The only difference being that I wasn't allowed any weapons. Still, in hindsight, it wouldn't have made any difference.

Shish Kebab is a weirdo, he keeps asking everybody ""what's going on ?"", often while the other guy is being ripped apart. As if he needs a specific detailed reason to start shooting something that mainly consists of talons and fangs and wants to kill him.
Passes anything that can be used as a defensive tool and starts breathing in a very uncomfortable way as soon as he's in danger.

Basically RE4 in a new dress, and it plays very nice with a few puzzles, a few scares and a few shoot the village people. Good fun.

The graphics are phenomenal and the plot for the game to be played in an open and beautifully designed world is awesome. The enemies are more unique and had their own abilities and difficulties than RE7 or some other RE games. Exploring the village and the other places in it is so enjoying and the unique twist of having 4 Powerful Lords, Mother Miranda as the main villain and the Megamycete. The twist of this game connecting all the RE games to it as because the virus and the mold originated in the village is also cool and the rest is for you to find out. First person perspective is also nice yet still has some issues with it. Weapons, combat and fights are also well made and worth it. The merchant or the Duke is also really helpful and has more options. The boss fights are also amzing yet despite having more boss fights than RE7, It's also strangely a bit easy to beat. The puzzles are also unique and vary in different special ways but can be straightforward and easy to hint though.
The scares and horrors also are both terrifying and awesome, with unexpected jumpscares, adrenaline, and the horrorific aura while exploring, never knowing what, when, where or how it will happen. The idea of making this a survival horror game is nice yet overly focused. The depth and informations behind all characters are well described and shown here, especially for Ethan, Lady Dimitrescu, Mither Miranda and some but some are still missing and left for the next game or for us to find. The Mercenaries mode and the other gameplay modes is also coola nd even having the models of each character, items and enemies in the game which you can buy is also a good concept. The songs and soundtracks used are awesome and memorable, hits a new medley and original in their own way. The story concept for the intro and credits is also uniqye and I swear I got Coraline Vibes from it. The cutscenes and acts are really pretty amazing and oh, all the items, treasures, weapons and crafted products are all still goodly unique. Although this game has issue with its action movements, camera and some bigs in the game, it's still an awesome and legendary game for us.💖💖
The voice actors also did a great job and the story, plot and overall are amazingly good and memorable. I love it and recommend to all other gamers there.
I just hope we get a DLC about the four lords soon (which is confirmed to be currently made😊) or have the famous Lady Dimitrescu, Ethan, the other lords maybe? And rose for the next game but It all depends to the developers and hope you'll all enjoy this game as much as we do.

While horror games have generally never been my jam, I've grown to really appreciate just how consistently good [i]Resident Evil[/i] games tend to be. I played through 7 back in October, and I enjoyed it, but couldn't help but feel that its limited scope actually hurt the game a little bit, as things like basic enemies weren't that fun to fight, and the story had largely lost my attention by the end. When I got this game, I was eager to see how these criticisms were addressed. And after playing through the game in just about 8 hours, I realized it is basically just an expanded version of 7 in pretty much every way.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

I loved this game visually. It's stunning, just like the previous game, and nails the atmosphere its going for. It's a lot more mysterious and intriguing, but it also knows when it can be scary.  I also really liked the designs of the characters, especially the antagonists. ""Vampire mommy milkers"" memes aside, each villain got my attention just based off of their appearances alone. The game looks good. There's not much else to say here.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

[i]Village[/i], if you haven't been able to deduce it already, has a lot more action elements compared to its predecessor. The core gameplay mechanics are essentially the same, that being a perfectly competent first-person shooter.  However, everything else is improved upon. Generally speaking, outside of one segment, there isn't really anything that hits the same high points that 7 hits, but the whole experience feels so much smoother here. There's a great amount of variety in the game, and while [i]Resident Evil[/i] seems to have always had a ""mediocre second half"" problem, which still exists in this game, I found that I had far more fun getting through this game's latter half compared to 2 and 7. And I think part of it is that this game absolutely [i]nails[/i] its pacing. 

As said before, this game has been compared to being at a theme park. Each of the four lords you're hunting has different gameplay mechanics. One is more of a pure survival horror experience where you're unarmed, another is more akin to classic Resident Evil where there is a particularly powerful enemy that's constantly hunting you down, and so on. I never felt that the game overstayed its welcome with any of these mechanics. Some are definitely longer than others, but by the time I'd start feeling bored, the game would end it with a boss fight or throw in a curveball to keep things interesting. Enemy variety actually exists in this game too, which I think helps keep the game from ever feeling dull. I also really liked the level design, as the game emphasizes and rewards exploration in multiple ways, from upgrades to lore, and I felt very compelled to stop and look for secrets. 

Where the game stumbles a little bit are in two areas: the boss fights and the puzzles. The bosses are less egregious, because I wouldn't say they were bad. More than anything, they were just a little disappointing. Considering how good most of the ones in 7 were, I found it a little ironic that this game excelled during its fights with basic enemies and stumbled with its bosses, where its predecessor was the opposite. Most fights were too straightforward, but hey, I'll at least appreciate this game's final boss for (RE7 spoilers) [spoiler]not being a glorified QTE.[/spoiler] The puzzles, however, were almost always way, way too easy. If I wasn't sure of what to do, I'd just trial-and-error it and accidentally get the solution, and I'd say there's only one puzzle that actually made me stop to think for a moment, and that's only because I'd overlooked something obvious. Most of the puzzle answers are basically handed to you, so the puzzles felt more like brief distractions more than actual breaks in combat and scares. But ultimately, it did not break the game for me. 

As I said, while the game doesn't often hit the same high points of 7, it is a more consistent title with better game design in general, as well as great pacing. Overall, the gameplay is largely smoothed out and it made my experience mostly better.

[h1]Story[/h1]

[i]Resident Evil[/i] games don't really have great stories most of the time. They're pretty corny, but weirdly endearing in the process. I think 7 was the exception to that rule, because while the final boss did disappoint me, I really liked the way the main antagonist's motivations were built up (as well as the rest of the Baker family), so I think [i[Village[/i] had some high standards to live up to. And it mostly does. 

Ethan Winters, the protagonist of RE7, has an actual personality now! He does have a tendency to make silly one-liners after surviving yet another near-death experience, but that's part of the [i]Resident Evil[/i] charm in my opinion. The villains were also pretty entertaining, but another big issue I had is that I don't think they were as interesting in the end as the Bakers. They got my attention almost immediately, but I think all of them, barring fan-favorite Lady D who was the highlight character in my opinion, needed some more screentime. I liked all of them, but I wanted to see more of them. 

I also liked the ending, and there was a really cool reveal towards the end that answered a major question I had while playing, and I love when stories explain gameplay mechanics. I will admit I am a bit concerned about where the story goes from here, because I'm aware this series struggled once it derailed into pure action, but I still liked the story overall. It's not amazing, but it's got some stellar twists and turns and I still liked it a lot.

[h1]Audio[/h1]

The sound design and music are both pretty good. There's really not much to discuss in those terms, as they fit what they're going for very well. The voice acting is what I'll be focusing on more here. As I said, Ethan actually has a personality now, and I think part of why it shows as much as it does is due to the solid performance from his voice actor. But, of course, the highlight here is the much-loved Lady D, who completely took control of every scene she was in. However, I was not a big fan of Heisenberg's voice. It felt like they were trying to go for something cool and intimidating, but the accent came off as being overly corny more than anything. However, that's more of a nitpick, as I still liked his character, and the rest of the performances were pretty good. *Sniff* They've come so far from ""Jill sandwich!"" 

[h1]Content Value[/h1]

All RE games are pretty short, but I think [i]Village[/i] makes the most out of every second of its 8-10 hour playtime. There's a lot more fun side content this time around, and there's also the potential for additional story DLC, which there is none of at the time of writing this. While there's only 1-2 moments in [i]Village[/i] that really stuck out to me compared to 7's highlights, this game feels much more replayable due to the overall polish. I'd say it's a safe buy despite the length, especially if there's even a light discount.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

While it may not be quite as interesting as its predecessor, [i]Village[/i] is a more polished experience overall with much better game design. The ""better"" game comes down to preference, and I personally prefer this one because it was still memorable in its own right. It's a great time, and I'd easily recommend it [strike]if only for Lady D.[/strike]
