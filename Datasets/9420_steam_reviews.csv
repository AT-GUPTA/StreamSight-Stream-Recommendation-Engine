Since its release, there has been none other like this and there may never be another one. The game just oozes class and passion of the developers, clearly evident in  the units and their designs. To me, this is the ultimate macro strategy game. The map sizes are huge, by huge I mean 81 KM x 81 KM in size. The sheer scale of the battles, the stratas being used, with recon fighters up top, followed by air superiority fighters, bombers, torpedo bombers, land and naval units, submerged units to giant mechs walking the ocean floor, it truly is an amazing sigh to see it all unfold. I also love how intelligence is vital, using radars, sonar and omni and then using counter intelligence to hide your units, truly insane. I can't recommend this game enough. One more thing, get the following mods:
1.) FAF: For multiplayer matches and general QOL improvements. A really good MOD which allows PVP as well as really good QOL improvements.
2.) LOUD project: My personal favourite as the entire core files of the game have been reworked, vastly improving the AI and allowing the game to finally run in excess of 40,000 units at once without any late game slowdown, enabling large scale epic warfare in the largest maps. The AI uses tactics well and changes them according to the situation. It turns each battle into a large strategic war where using integrated warfare tactics become essential. 

As an RTS fan, this game is the best in the macro scale. Nothing else even comes close. 10/10.",1705676790,1705676790,True,33,0,0.780984759330749512,0,True,False,False

Came looking for a good RTS fix. Tried the original and found it incredibly rough. Then, saw many people suggesting giving it a skip and coming straight to this one, supposedly the 'best in the series.'

Begs the question: did I just skip an entire game's-worth of difficulty curve or are Supreme Commander fans just sadists? 

Well, given the absurdity of the very first level, I'm betting more on masochists.

Regardless, improved though this may be, my problems with the first still remain:

[list]
  [*]Glacial game speed.
  [*]Units are slow to respond to commands
  [*]""Commands"" sometimes seem more like ""suggestions."" 
  [*]Units behave in some truly baffling, braindead ways. (Path-finding is all over the place, and I would regularly find my aerial units wandering off for impromptu 1-vs-20 dogfights, far away from any of my air defenses.)
  [*]I probably am doing any number of things wrong, but neither this nor the original concerned themselves much with explaining anything. This one offered an insultingly simplistic tutorial, and then there are the forums and Youtube to see how it's actually supposed to be played.

The game is very old and the company behind it is no more. You should get this old title for historical insight in the genre and to broaden your RTS perspective, not for (the lack of) technical merits, but despite them to get a different angle on things.

As tech has advanced since then, the game has aged badly in comparison. This should be taken both figuratively and literally - it was targeted to run on XP. That is 2 versions of windows before windows 7, for you youngsters out there.

The game looks like all possible bad ideas in one product

1. You need 3 different types of workers to build 3 different lvls of buildings. In all other games it's just one type worker units with multitasking, here, to build a specific structure, you should first produce a specific type of workers. 

2. Usually, you unlock new units by building some structure or doing the research. Not in this game. Instead, if you have 3 factories and you need siege tanks, you need to upgrade manually EVERY SINGLE factory to lvl 2, and than do it again to lvl 3 in each building.

3. You can (and must) upgrade your reactors, but, unlike every other RTS, here extractors STOP MINING for all long upgrade period. So you can't just upgrade all of them at one time - you will lost all income until upgrade is finished.

4. In other RTS games if you have overflow on some resource, it continue to rise to be spent later, when you notice.
Here there is a limit and it as very low, and when you reach it in a couple of seconds, you blocked, you just losing energy or mass. Only solution is to build storages for mass and energy. A lot of them.

5. Should i mention that instead of building generators to produse energy, this game has 3 different lvls of generators, and every type of cource, should be built only by specific engineer? 

Eco in this game purposely made so hard and frustrating, i can't understand how anyone can have fun struggling with it.

I played the original SC more, and picked it up on Steam later to play it again. 

With the gold edition, you get both for a great price, and it's worth playing the original for the campaign, but after that it's FA ftw. It got a major overhaul to many aspects of the gameplay, and adds another faction, so it's overall a much better game.

The control system and Sorian AI are good enough that skirmishes are still fun years later.
I still regularly play the campaign with each faction too, from time to time.

It's definitely not perfect, the story is absolute cringe and the NPC chatter is grating af, but the huge maps, control system and AI opponents, is where it's at. Turn down the voice-over to a level where it can be comfortably ignored, and it's a great game I still play to this day.

Either way, the game is an amazing take on the RTS genre, with one of the biggest senses of scale on the market.

The long story: the original SC was really, REALLY rough around the edges. Units had some pretty dumb pathfinding, certain weapons / units were a little broken (in both OP and just plain broken terms) and could overall use polish... but it set a fine enough story to be progressed here. In this expansion, you get an entirely new story, a few new units, a new faction, and many of the broken factors are fixed; pathfinding is still a disgusting issue, but that's just because this is a pretty old game. If you want to play online, easily mod, or just enjoy a bit of a better experience, remember to get Forged Alliance Forever, a free community-made client to this game.

Land, air, navy, buildings, artillery, nukes, you name it, everything is available in this game. Want to steamroll opponents with a neverending horde of tanks and mechs? Go for it. Want to airstrike them into oblivion with bombers, own the skies with fighters, and pummel them with a stream of gunships? You got it. Want to dominate the water and blast your opponent off their barren rock from afar? Navy is your approach. You can even do all of them at once to be the unpredictable menace you know you can be. Improve your economy to fuel your hungering war machine with higher-tier mass extractors and power generators, make shields and turrets for your factories, or build massive artillery installations whose range can span half an entire map, annihilating everything in the blast zone. Or unleash your faction's nuclear arsenal with strategic missile launchers, the choice is all yours. Do them all at once to be the real supreme commander.

And it would be a crime not to mention the experimental units the game offers. Massive mobile factories with battleship-grade weapons? Sign me up. Multi-legged spiderbots with microwave lasers mounted on their heads? Sure thing! Flying saucers with death beams on the bottom? Gargantuan bombers that can annihilate entire armies in one bomb? Experimental artillery classified as game-ending? This game has something for everyone, and a lot of times, you don't need much strategy. Choose the faction that most suits you, because they all were meticulously designed not to overwhelm the others; they all have their strengths and weaknesses, but none of them inherently beat the others by themselves. Cover your weaknesses, bolster your strengths, and choose your tactics appropriately. Dive in and become the supreme commander.",1698244632,1698244632,True,34,0,0.792219638824462891,0,True,False,False

[strike]Although it appears I don't have much time on this game (I had to leave it open for five minutes so that I could make this review[/strike], I have been using the client ""Forged Alliance Forever,"" a fan-made client for Forged Alliance multiplayer, that I highly suggest you download and play through in case you want to enjoy this game to the fullest. [strike]Unfortunately, FAF doesn't display on Steam when you've launched the program.[/strike] (It does now!!) This client comes with balance patches made lovingly by fans of the game for fans of the game, continuing even after the difficult death of Gas Powered Games, which resulted in the multiplayer dying, which is where FAF picks up. (The Steam version and FAF are different games entirely, allowing you to play either one. FAF just legally requires you to own a copy of the game so that you may play FAF.) Although I might be a newcomer to this game (around 30-50 hours), I can assure my love for this game is genuine and with good reason.

This game is incredibly difficult for newcomers, with a large skill floor and an even higher skill ceiling, which Supreme Commander 2 decided to fix by lowering the skill ceiling entirely, removing much of the complexity of the game; not to mention the fact that the game itself was made with consoles in mind, which was a result of a port to the Xbox melting the machine from the performance. So what makes it difficult?

People who know how to play this game will dumpster you. Completely and absolutely, no matter how good your talent for RTS is. You will learn from your mistakes, and have to tutor yourself in order to get better at the game. The variety of strategy and maps absolutely astounds me for a game that is one and a half decades old. You are your own greatest enemy when you are a newcomer. If you mess up your economy early, more proficient players will easily take advantage of the time and resources you have wasted to mount an attack and absolutely massacre you. Economy is no laughing matter, and very heavily punishing if not managed correctly. Stalling should be avoided in almost all cases, because the build times grow exponentially larger as you have less and less resources to put into build orders, which leads to a cascade effect on your economy; you lose time, which means you lose resources, losing you your ability to expand your economy, losing resources which you could've gained if you hadn't stalled, and the cycle repeats itself. I cannot stress enough how important your start is in this game.

In addition to economy being very difficult to manage for newcomers in this game, strategy is also key and difficult to learn. Of course, there are many rush and heavy offensive strategies, but how about defense? As a newcomer, the most likely tactic to pick would be to hunker down and turtle, using strong point-defense, anti-air, and shields to stop enemy fire. If this strategy, the so-called ""You-Shall-Not-Pass"" defense is employed, I can 100% guarantee that you will lose, spectacularly. Not only are your protections stagnant and not moving, allowing for an easy target, but point defenses and anti-air can be easily countered through ranged artillery, high health units, and/or experimentals. They do not move, and are sitting ducks for any kind of counterplay. Your utmost priority when it comes to defense is simply to create better units. This game is a shining example of ""Offense is the best defense."" How is a newcomer supposed to know that one of the main strategies for one faction is to do nothing but bolster resource generation so that they may rush a T3 Assault Bot? Just like any other game, you don't learn strategies by just intuition, you have to learn the meta of the game so that you know what to do and what your opponent is going to do.

So now that you've read through why this game is so difficult for newcomers, you might be asking, ""Okay, so why do you like this game so much?"" For starters, this game is so difficult for newcomers because it is there are so many options and strategies. The game is so open-ended that it makes it compelling to learn. It tells you, ""So you think you're hot stuff huh? Alright, let me just drop a textbook on you about the strategy in this game, so daunting that it might turn you away."" That might sound pretty awful, but learning is part of the fun when it comes to Forged Alliance. When you do well in this game, you feel like an absolute genius. When you do good in this game, you know that it wasn't luck (mostly), but pure skill on your end, you are absolutely sure that you did something right. When you can counter the opponent and end their ACU, the death nuke is just so absolutely satisfying. This game isn't for everybody, just like RTS isn't for everybody.

My two gripes with this game is the learning curve and the other being my own fear that there will never be another RTS that will ever top this. Those in itself isn't so bad, though. I enjoy the fact that I actually have to learn about the game in a deeper sense to understand how to win. Oh, and also, on a smaller note, the AI isn't very good. The best way to practice is against other players, which might seem daunting, given that I just told you that older players will steamroll you, but there are many helpful, active players in the community, and also videos and guides to help you along the way. 

Good luck, Commander, and don't power stall.",1543137446,1698143775,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AI controlled units which sense enemy units within range but behind obstructions continuous fire with futility.  They'd be significantly more lethal if after a certain threshold of time/rounds fired they tried another tactic.

AI commanders are not very clever when under attack making them valuable easy targets in the early game for winning their resources and gaining control of their technology.

The campaign is mostly difficult for the first 10-20min and then it is mostly easy. And, since missions last for over an hour with the map expanding after each objective being met, it is a slog fest when you get the hang of it (especially after the initial defence and base setup).

The story is not much better than in the first game. The new faction is quite powerful as it has all the ups of other factions - kind of like a jack of all trades. But that doesn't matter when you build up on units and swarm the enemy with all you've got.

The game sure is better than the first but still not much to talk about when playing it without any mods or just playing campaign.

Where the game really shines is with the modding community. Now THAT is the reason you get this game. ""Forged Alliance Forever"" is a must honestly.

- Massive scale makes it good for macro players, but micro players can zoom right down and control individual units
- Unique resource scheme means that controlling your build is more crucial than ever.  Just two resources are available but the capability to over-subscribe and go into negatives makes it surprisingly nuanced.
- This isn't just a rush-fest.  Turtling is just as viable in this game.  A large variety of playstyles can be used each with their strengths and weaknesses.  Nothing quite beats the thrill of completing that massive artillery piece after 1.5 hours of real-time building it, then subsequently crushing your opponent from across the map.

The bad:
- Weak AI means that you have to use cheating AI, which is just unfair.  The Sorian AI helps but doesn't conpletely correct this.
- Online lobbies are a bit weak.  Thankfully Forged Alliance Forever largely fixes this: https://www.faforever.com/

The ugly:
- The un-modded AI tries to control dead units, which means that the game will slow down over time.  To make things worse, the original game hails from 2006 when multi-core CPUs were in their infancy.  As such it is single-threaded and your fancy 8-core CPU won't help.  All this means that the game will slow to a crawl during long player vs. AI games.  You really need the Sorian AI mod to fix this.

[b]New Players[/b]:
Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is an RTS game that is set far in the future, where the events of the first game continues. You can play one of four factions that consist of the UEF, Cybran, Aeon and the new faction known as the Seraphim. Each has their own unique aesthetics with different units that gets used to overwhelm the enemy commander.


[b]Review[/b]:
Off the bat, this is a greatly improved version of the game. It's still Supreme Commander, but plenty of quality of life changes got made that give the player a much better experience when playing.

[b]Game play[/b]:
The game has introduced a lot more units and structures with one of the better ones being engineer stations. Usually, you would create engineers to help assist with building and speeding unit production, but the station now automatically does it for you which saves a lot time, but also gives you some unit cap back.

The interface has also been changed and I found it much easier to find things than before. There's still the issue of icons being small with higher resolutions, but the setup is neater and much better organized.

The majority of everything else is the same. Get your economy running, build defenses, fuel an army and kill off the enemy commander. 

[b]Graphics[/b]:
I didn't notice too much of an upgrade. The Seraphim of course look pretty cool, but the main difference I noticed was the upgrade of portraits. Dostya, Rhiza, Burke and all the others are greatly enhanced which looks damn cool. I still opted to put most of my settings on low, because things can get distracting when playing such an RTS, and I prefer seeing information to detailed graphics.

[b]Story[/b]:
Events continue after one of the factions ([i]by the looks of it the Aeon[/i]), fired Black Sun. What unexpectedly followed was the a gate opening for the Seraphim who were waiting for an opportunity to strike. They took everyone by surprise and nearly annihilated the factions. Some of the Aeon broke off and create the Order to side with the Seraphim.

This forced the human factions to create an alliance to fight off the invaders. Once again, the player is given the option to choose which faction to represent, but this time, the entire campaign is the same for all three factions, with the difference being side-quests and which commander portraits display during the campaign.

I did not attempt to complete the campaign with all three factions. As much as I love this game, completing levels are time consuming and having to re-complete levels with the only change really being playing a different faction is not that appealing for me, but I'll come back to play this again at a later stage.

[b]Conclusion[/b]:
If you loved the original, you'll most probably love this one even more. By the time I completed the first one, I thought I was over it, but then starting off this one just got me back into it, especially with all of the upgrades and changes, not to mention, the story is also pretty good.",1695436494,1695436494,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well it's the barrier to entry. Folks who play it played it for a long time, there are lots of build videos and guides to be ultra efficient with meta n whatnot which is not very fun to try to get into as noob. I played a lot of rounds against AI watched alot of casts and decided to try multiplayer and holy cow. It matched me against players like 500+ my elo. First couple matches dropped me to -200 or less and the next match paired me against a 900. I can say I did nearly win pretending to turtle like I was playing against AI which let the guys guard down and amassed hundreds of t1 Arty's and tanks. Cleaved a path of destruction through everything of his, couldn't find com, guy got out a couple mongooses and I lost. Never playing again. Strats like that don't really work in Supcom though more than likely anyone else would have scouted with air and hard countered. The community wants more people to play but I don't see it when you can be matched with someone 500+ while also needing to like study guides n builds to play at decent level isn't fun.

Bought it years ago. Lost it and bought it again on Steam. Still one of my favourite games in the RTS Genre. Best compliment possible for a game.


This is an RTS and it continues the story of    'Supreme Commander'.  Some characters will be there again. But the story is by far less clever. It has less twists and less surprises. 
 
The game has a good and slow starting tutorial about a few missions. You don't need it to understand the game if you have played   'Supreme commander'   or other RTS with base building. The fractions have different buildings. For the most of them, just the look is different. If you have played the first game this experience is a small adavantage. Of course every fraction has to produce energy and win material of the ground. But some fighting capabilities are really different. This is true for your fighting vehicles (air, water, ground) as well. The Mega-Fighting Vehicles can be described as  MECHs (like in Mech Warrior). And the ground units look like this. The grafics were modern when the game was new but they are still pretty today.
Since energy and material are short and special buildings to overcome the shortage are very expensive, it is important on what you spend your ressources. Different strategies can lead to victory - and I did not make the experience you can see in some videos on youtube: the nukes (nuclear missiles) do not always end the game - not at all. 
I like the gameplay of Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance a bit more than the gameplay of   'Supreme Commander'  -  its precessor. This counts for the campaign as well as for the free game maps. There could be more of them but after all these years I still have fun with them and the fight on a large map can last for hours. Some maps I play against several AI opponents and the alliances of fractions are totally free to your disposal. And the best is: you play the new (4th) alien fraction as well. This is great fun.

One last word: don't buy Supreme Commander 2 after you've played these two games mentioned here. You won't like it anymore even this is not a bad game.",1637956634,1690297932,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The community has taken over updating the game and providing matchmaking services after the official ones were discontinued.  (look for the ""Forged Alliance Forever"" launcher online.  They even made a patch so it runs on Linux.)

The game focuses more on macro strategy instead of micro so can appeal to those lower APM players like myself.  It has 4 factions with each roughly similar units, but each faction has notable aspects and shortcomings unique to their faction.  Despite the differences there is not a clear power imbalance between the 4 factions as long as they are played to their respective play styles.

One other notable thing that shines about this game to me is it's second monitor support and the ability to zoom out to the entire map.  This game does not have a mini map, but rather has no limit to how far out you can zoom the camera.  The second monitor acts like a completely seperate view and both can be zoomed in or out individually.  This means the second monitor can be a full screen ""mini"" map, or you can be watching two seperate sections of the battlefield and giving orders to both at the same time.

So glad I picked this game up during my high school years and on Steam, one RTS game that I keep coming back to, even with today's modern titles.

The [u]Gameplay[/u] is unique from the other titles I've played, such as [b]StarCraft[/b] 1 & 2, [b]Command & Conquer[/b], [b]Company of Heroes[/b] 1 & 2, [b]Rise of Nations[/b], etc. You start with an empty map (depending on the settings) and spawn in with that sick shock wave that will burn the nearby trees, and soon after, the match begins as structures are erected at the crater. There are tiers in Supreme Commander, which makes this title stand out! Units are small at first but get deadlier as you upgrade the levels. If tier 3 units are not good enough, build an experimental unit.

The main [u]Story[/u]: Sadly, I never play it, even today... Mostly play Skirmish/Comp-Stomp (I wonder if that exists nowadays) with family and friends.

Have we got a noise complaint? No problem, show them this game, and once they blow up a commander, they will look at you and nod slowly. (Put it on easy otherwise, it's an eviction...)

There are technical issues with no borderless fullscreen, no UI scaling, and a crap tutorial that crashes at the end. The UI itself is very hard to read.

The campaign maps are enourmous, and units are tiny, impossible to make out what you're looking at, constantly zooming in and out.

Units and structures take forever to build, descriptions are vague and upgrades are not very visible, and take even longer

The 'campaign' starts you with every unit on a huge map with an overwhelming enemy that destroys most units built until upgraded. The story is all boring exposition, no explanation other than kill the enemy.

Your own Air units will randomly wander around the map no matter what commands you give, getting destroyed immediately most of the time and wandering into anti-air range. There is no control of unit formations whatsoever.

Really a great game and you'd be hard pressed to find even a recent RTS release supplanting Supreme Commander. Even the computers of today can slow down from an epic Supreme Commander battle. I've had many years of enjoyment of both singleplayer and with friends out of this title.  Pathfinding, especially with the AI, can have issues, and the Soren AI is needed for a challenge.  This did get a spiritual sequel in the Kickstarted Planetary Annihilation, but I was not a fan even though I was a backer.  That game has AI that was trained with machine learning to be a better ""smarter"" player and a significantly different art style.

This is it, there is no reason to search for any other strategy. There are few things that makes that game so good. 1. Races are both similar and completely different. What does it even mean? Generally most races have the same setup of units, scouts, light mechs, tanks, medium tanks, light artillery, the list go on. Its not like one has zergling and other marines, which are completely different things. But. Units themselves differ, a lot. And skilled commander will abuse those differences. Maybe one unit has better rotating turret, better tracking, maybe its slightly faster. For a beginner its barely a difference, in reality its a line between op and useless.2. Resource system is pretty unique (I think Total Annihilation, which I believe is a spiritual parent of this game used it too). You both balance your income/spending and use your stock. Want to keep building army non stop? Sure, balance income and keep producing stuff indefinitely. Need to ramp up production because of strategic reasons? Sure, use your stockpile to produce more than your income allows. 3. Reclaiming. Technically its also about resources but it has deeper nuance to it. Throwin units at the enemy sounds fun and cool, but you gotta remember, that enemy can and will reclaim what he/she kills so by attacking without plan you basically give your enemy free stuff. On the other hand, well planned strike will earn you resources your enemy used.4. Maps have tons of different sized, which allows diversity in gameplay.5. Less logical BS. You wont see marine killing battlecruiser. 6. Combining air, ground and naval units is crucial. You might want invest more in one, but there will be no success if you just spam 1 or 2 units over and over again, and you better not give your enemy full air superiority.7. Game requires both micro and macro management from the player, skilled player will really shine.8. Now for surprise. The game is actually still developed, though by fans. Forged Alliance Forever keeps it alive, has client for easier matchmaking, downloading maps and so on. They rebalance the game, improve it, and even works on 5th race! (Which is I believe in beta right now).9. Graphics are old. But not ""bad"" old. The game is surprisingly pretty.10. Music is really catchy, 8/8 from me. 11.

Recently I finally got a PC even though its a dell with a 12 dollar graphics card that I bought off of amazon but I'm able to try some games that I always wanted to play but couldn't because they were only on PC. Forged Alliance was one of these games and I absolutely enjoy it even though the game's age is rivaling mine to some extent. This game seems to be at the peak of it's genre while the whole RTS scene was pushed into obscurity by the huge rise of gamers and wide appealing games took over the market. The series tried to change with the time by making Supreme Commander 2 more simple to appeal to a larger audience but ended with destroying what it was known for by the fans of the series. This game is a relic in all senses and being kept alive by the small and dedicate community that have a huge amount of content they have made to keep it alive. The people behind FAF (Forged Alliance Forever) managed to bring the last of the community together and even made the story missions be able to play in CO-OP which I find insane.

This game creates the common sin of any RTS... 
...Unit caps... 
If Command & Conquer: Red Alert can diversify units without needing a unit cap and still have strategy? I'd expect the same from your game. Both in their prime were AAA titles... You know what also ruined evil genius 2 for a lot of people? Unit caps; capped at an abyismally small 300; the problem with that was you're conducting global operations and only had so many staff that when you maxed out you could get overwhelmed. Unit caps are the bane of actual strategic thinking. The only game I say did it right was Valkyira Chronicles 1 through 4, and that's because you can actually think of where to position everyone and get ready for the fight in advance, and the unit cap made sense because you were commanding a militia. 
 
So why do I take issue here with the unit cap? You're supposed to be leading an entire army, air force, and naval force. And you usually need so many energy, mass and storage facilities that those take up more of your unit cap than anything else, and upgrades dwindle this set of resources like nothing else burning through it in narely 10 seconds. The unit cap to me is a sign of cowardice and incompitence. For as cool as the game is with the extra one faction?

I first played the SC series in SC 2 on the 360. I got it free with gold and it was the shit! It was so much fun, and a fantastic RTS! And the thing that makes SC so special to me is that you're not limited to specific building plots. 

You want to build a factory over there? Be my guest! 

Want to colonize that island with mass? Go wild! 

Want to erect a series a walls with turrets and shields and couple artillery lines to keep the filthy seraphim from immigrating to your side of the map? Please do that actually, they are a menace and they keep bombing my factories so that I can't pay my under-aged ""employees"" to build my precious assault bots.

My point is that in terms of RTS games, in my opinion, SC stands above them with an iron fist! I've played plenty of them: Stellaris, Halo wars 1 and 2, Empire at War, Homeworld, Supreme Commander 2, Air Mech Arena (Yeah I know, that one is a bit odd), and Heroes and Castles 1 and 2 (Those 2 are RTS games YOU WILL NOT CHANGE MY MIND!!!), and the Supreme Commander games just stick with me the best. 

Last point. 
Supreme Commander Forged Alliance is every Supreme Commander 2 is, but dialed up to 13.

Yea maybe skirmish. even then the bot either dies at the start or you both start playing who can spam the most units.
not a lot of units too it as well .i made the mistake of thinking ""oo ok if this then that and that counters this which gets countered by that""

there is just essentially Tank , Art , Flak 
And there are only 3 types of buildings. Land Air Naval
So each building has its equivalent.
Air has fighters bombers and gunships... also transports but those go away at tier 3 buildings and well.. Its just a utility. 
Naval has something like Subs , Destoryers and Anti Air? Something lke that. 

its just 3 of the same category.
and in buildings its defenses. Air and ground
Then once you level up you get essentially Trebuchet's from AoE. Tactical missile launcher and Artillary Post. 

in other species its something just like that.
minor differences but you should see how mandalore and other youtubers  sell it. Like if they don't they'll have to suck dick for their dinner. 

its.. eh.. really.

.imagine Empire Earth or Age of Empires

They didn't give new units each age
They allowed you to make Archers Meele and Seige. 
And then Each age you could make a ""now you can make units that are the same. but we changed the name and made it look slightly different..... they do +12 damage and have +20 range""
so when you get attacked you go ""OH NO tier 2-3 units. and this is an archer.. it does..... Damage.. yea none cares"" 

More beats less
Make 9-10 of each building ( I am not joking your mass numbers might look low. but with 40 mass you can support 10 Land factories... like upkeep. per second kinda. constantly making units) and you are done
Really if you wanna get to the AI. Just make more of whatever building they have than them and then set them all to loop and craft and keep sending it in. eventually you will win... .if the AI doesn't fuck it up

if you dont actually want to play
Just level up to teir 3 . get an engineer out and make a Tact Missile launcher or a Artillary post... 
Tons of defense and just sit back.. go to the toilet. and when you are back you win

serisouly.. going to teir 3 is such an easy win it feels like cheating... cause i get to do nothing in the game then. and its so easy to get there... with resources ofc.


eaither way im so fucking tired of being cheated and lied to

you know how old games used to be about the computer being a simulation machine that could help you learn new shit by simulating it for you
sort of like owning a race car , plane and guns in one. without having to pay for all the nonsense.
but you learnt. it was about seeing how it works
So in old RTS there was a counter to everything cause it was about learning.. And they made counters buy thinking ""Ok if this is a tank then in real life there were anti tanks and planes. planes got downed by AA and lets have mobile AA. and if its a gigagiant robot then beacause it has legs and aromour shaped like a human let its counter be something new invented for this specifcally and to make sense and have fun.. and no , no 1 thing wins all. they need to use all effectively and win. and i'll make winning fun""

Yea no.. nomore. the counter is ""OMG big robot.. hmm so many things it does but it reall doesn't matter lol :D .If i can hit it enough. it will die. and i dont care how many units or what they are cause the all do the same thing if i have to crash a 1000 planes on its face and sacrifice 200 tanks just to get near it so the rest 800 can shoot while the planes crash into its face.. good enough.. expendable lot.."" 

who cares about strategy.Its about counters with production planes comming your way. no matter.. how much.
tanks. how much
ships.. lol.. how much. 

not waht kind. How much.  cause its either going to be a fighter and bomber or a gunship. or transport.. and As long as you can damage them you win. and you can damage them the same. with the same thing. They aren't different they are just the same shit with different skins so you aren't bored looking at them. Not cause its a strategy game. 

this is why i dont play games now. any new game has a fanatic crazy fan base and they all go ""game game gam game game game so good game game game game. Put hand foward i give game"" and then they put in your hand shit they just picked from teh toilet of the game devs who they workshp like gods. and i have to sit and go ""maybe if i unwrap all the shit. its inside... because noneway peopel get exited for shit .. .right?""


I know how to build units.I just dont know what to build.
what takes out interceptors? What takes out medium tanks? what takes out artillary ? 
i know i can take them out. And maybe even relibably.
the problem is by the time i take them out 5 more than the last tiem come out
and the problem becomes how do i win. how do my force = enemy force. 
i need to know the time between the 1st wave and the next so i know not just how to kill them but how fast so i can make enough to be ready for the next wave. 
and that's the issue

i might enjoy skirmish with an ai when its on equal terms but if i play with a friend we will both just keep guessing what does what. 

which is such a shit thing. I hate it.

but i want to enjoy it cause its so cool and fun looking with the massive machines and the cool sounds and anaimations and effects.


and the ai cheats. if it has 12 air factories and i have 20 how the fuck come it has more t2 fighters than i have t1 and added mobile Flak AA t2?
WHEN MY FUCKING STATIC DEFENSES HAVE BEEN KILLING MORE THAN THAT EVERY WAVE IT SENDS?
WHILE MAKING 28 BOMBERS EVER WAVE ADDED ON IT?

Atleast skirmish is fun right? not like the Ai cheats right? not like it suddenly has a massive base?.. Yes?

FUCKA
i can win but am i winning correctly?
Is this your design of fun?

if this works like this. and that works like that. how would you solve this scenario using it all.
That's gaming
not
this works. that works. Solve. OH NO we dont know how it works exactly which is means you solution is failing and now im going to act as if that is the game figuring out how this and that works so you can figure out how why your solution failed and what solution to make. fuck you btw im goign to act its like the greatest game ever.

i tried. I just cant anymore. even the skirmish is bs and i need to take time just to figure the nonsense out before i can start playing",1671668586,1671736615,False,0,2,0.425083577632904053,0,True,False,False

I dont know where to start. Lets start with the pros since it be way faster.
PROS:
    -[u]Nice graphics:[/u] The game held up realy well
    -[u]FaF[u/] community expansion ironed out most of the originals ballance issues
 CONS:
    -[u]Cutthroath community[/u]: Most of my games is 1V1's and 2v2's since if you want to join in costum 
      lobbys there is a rating and/or min game played req. and host just KICK you out. Getting the 100 game 
      mark where I sit is a MISERY what i dont whish for my enemy. 
    -[u]Small playerbase[/u]: You can see how this directly ties up to prev. con. Game lobby takes a while to fill. 
      No need to explain.
    -[u]Bad tutorial[/u]: On FAF you dont realy hawe acces to tutorials just play. You can see how this is going 
      to kill your rating and your enjoyment. Even if you get the game sense quicly here is something else.
    -[u]BAD BALLANCE (ratings)[/u]: The game and the community considers those numbers like holy 
      writhings. For them 2 1k rated player is the same in performance as 1 2k rated. 1K rated players are 
      around averange 2k is considered pro. Where else you see a pro going up agnist 2 other and it ""FAIR"". 
      Its Bull****.
    -[u]LAG[/u]: Since its a PTP hosted game latency and disconects are infesting the game. Even if you got a 
      decent match you can bet 1 player is going to DC.
    -[u]Game req.:[/u] Hold on before you say wtf is wrong with you and read this. The game is heawy on CPU 
      and HOST frequently ask you for a CPU test. What is built into the game lobby. 
      LASTLY BUT NOT LEAST!!
    -[u]INFLUENCERS[/u]: Oh god god what hawe I done. Let myself get caught up in the YouNoob promotion 
      videos. Save yourself and dont. What videos you see are the cream of the top. The 5% of the games  
      where it dosent DC and the ballance is actualy achiwed.

There's no complicated elements like armor/damage resistance or limited resources.

The game is incredibly unrestricted in terms of playstyles and there are lots of different ways to complete your objectives. The learning process can be tricky without external guides and tutorials. 
The main campaign is decent with a plenty of twist and surprises. Opponent AI is also decent enough, and with certain mods, it becomes much more adaptive and unpredictable.

Much like the classic original Total Annihilation, The Supreme Commander series is a solid RTS that delivers pretty much constant action. I have found the Forged Alliance title to be the most replayable of the lot, mostly because of the differing faction unit options with their varying strengths and weaknesses within the same missions (Cybran is easiest and Aeon hardest). The downside is that there are only 7 missions, but even that is mitigated by them being multi-leveled, taking solid gameplay to work through (especially in hard mode).

Unfortunately crashes all the time on my PC (on load/restart/menus, luckily not during game, ymmv).
Campaign is sorta fun, it is the only reason I clicked ""recommend"". Though the previous part's was better.
Other than the campaign, this expansion adds one more faction. But factions are mostly the same as each other anyway, just different skins and minor differences in some stat or mechanic here or there, at least until you get to the last tier of units.

AI skirmish is waste of time, built-in AIs are too easy, their ""cheater"" versions are impossibly hard, and even the modded AIs are no good - they fall easily to early 1-unit camping of key locations, rushes or other tricks, or if you chose to not resort to those and let them get half the map and play for the long haul they outpace you economically so fast you stand no chance on most large maps despite giving you the illusion of having a chance for a while by senselessly throwing most of their eco advantage by flying loaded transports over the same aa turrets and tons of land units onto the same point defences over and over again.
Haven't bothered trying multiplayer because it's mostly on a 3rd party service ""FAF"" which despite implementing Steam OpenID for verifying your ownership of the game, did not do the sensible thing and implement it for login/registration as well, but instead requires you to give them non-gaming related OAuth social accounts and email address. No, thanks.
No wonder it barely has a thousand people around there.

Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is a fantastic real-time strategy game involving a unique selection of units for every faction, which invites players to experiment with different playstyles and strategies. 

One noteworthy element is the game's community, which is still ongoing despite being a game made in 2011. Please go to https://www.faforever.com/ to check out their client, connect with other players, play an updated/improved game version, and get access to various mods. 

Pros:
+Large variety of units within each faction, each having its strengths, weaknesses, and aesthetics
+Good single-player campaign
+Excellent economy/resource system that affects early game strategies and playstyles
+Graphics are still somewhat tolerable for a 2011 game
+Strong multiplayer community in Forged Alliance Forever, with access to competitions, ranking systems, mods, and more.

Neutral:
*Base game does not reveal certain strategic elements that are pretty important, especially in early game strategies (for example, adjacency bonus resource production)

Cons:

[b]However, if you're going to get into this game, I strongly recommend checking out FAF or the LOUD project.[/b]
FAF, Forged Alliance Forever, is a PvP focused continuation of the game with a dedicated playerbase, balancing, some fancy mods including a 5th faction, and tournaments.

If you're more interested in the PvE side of Forged Alliance, browse the internet instead for the LOUD project mod. This mod tunes up the AI to be a lot smarter and optimizes the game for larger scale battles. Very fun! And comes with its own built-in mods! (Optional, of course.)

It's been a decade since my original review, and this is still the greatest strategy game ever made.

--------------------------------------

This is the greatest strategy game I've ever played.

If you like micro management, macro management, and armies of robots, you will sink 100's of hours into this masterpiece. Features four different yet balanced playable factions, multitudes of strategic options at your disposal, epic soundtrack, varied game modes, THOUSANDS of maps, full mod support - this game literally has it all.

Bombard your enemy with massive artillery from across the map? Sure.
Death from above with swarms of jet fighters? Allll day.
Nuke your enemy into oblivion with warheads? Go for it.
Break down their front door with hordes of robotic soldier drones? Heck yes.
Or maybe spend the entire game building one catastrophic engine of doom and fly over them with the flying saucer from hell, spewing lasers and bombs in every direction? Hey, why not.

All of these options and several more are in there, and each tactic can be countered by a different one. Your mind is the limit.

Why is Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance the best RTS there is?
-The game is pure, undiluted RTS. No branching tech trees, no ""doctrines"" that lock you out of other playstyles, no ""you can only build this unit once"", no ""you must capture this zone to score points"", no bullsh*t. Each battle begins with just your Commander unit, and you can immediately start constructing all buildings and units from Tier 1. To access the next tech level, you just ""buy"" a simple Tier 2 upgrade, same for factories. This game is just you, the map, the AI, and all the units you can build. Pure, total war.
-This game may offer the largest battles of any RTS, with options for unit caps going up to 1000+. They don't HAVE to be large, but if ""big boom-boom"" is what you want, this is the game for you.
-Every unit is effective, there are no ""useless"" units.
-Every unit is balanced, there are no ""OP instant win"" units.
-The first player to the max tech level doesn't instantly guarantee victory, you can still have a meaningful chance at survival and victory even when your opponent outclasses you.
-The resource income & management is balanced without ever limiting what kinds of strategies you can play with.
-You can zoom all the way in...and all the way out. As in, close enough in that you can see the scratches on the paint, and far enough out that you can see *literally* the entire battlefield.
-You are given lots of options for customizing battles. Change the unit cap for all teams or only one team, restrict certain units, add civilian bases, add a ""no starting rush"" timer, various victory conditions, etc.
-Some of the best maps in any RTS (Seton's Clutch will always be my favorite)
-Still has an active multiplayer base
-Comes with a handful of optional mods you can activate if you want, to make the game easier, harder, or just different
-Very nice graphics, even by today's standards.
-Extremely intuitive UI and controls; SupCom is arguably the game that set the standard for UI's and control layouts for all RTS games to come
-Very effective system of alerts and sound cues. Never too frequent, never jarring, and each one is distinct.
-Each faction has a distinct artstyle, and each unit looks cool yet practical.
-The game even has a very nice OST, complete with contextual music tracks.",1665210853,1665210970,True,73,0,0.869428515434265137,2,True,False,False

Since Sup Com: FA released in 2007, it has established itself as a big name in the RTS genre. I know some people love this game, and I'm not going to change their mind. On the other hand, my experience has been frustrating. In this review I try and articulate where I think this frustration is coming from.

Performance: 2/5
back in 2007 when this game released there always came a point where the game would turn into a laggy mess, and its still true in 2022. The 1000 unit cap in the game is a stupid made up number.  If you are playing a short small scale map then performance is manageable, otherwise performance decay will creep up until the game is unplayable. 

Single player experience: 1/5
Playing campaign mode felt like I was being kept in the dark. I would make incremental progress, and then suddenly a timer/other condition would trigger revealing a whole new section of the map and I would have to race towards a new objective. It felt poorly executed & more mentally exhausting than rewarding.

Resource management: 1.5/5
Resource management starts off being relatively straight forward, but as your economy scales, resource management tends to be more complex. Weird things start to happen, such as the resource bar oscillating between being full & empty. If/when you do get resource capped, it can last for forever. 

Pathing: 1.5/5
I frequently have to give units multiple commands to move from A to B. Sometimes its because the AI doesn't handle formations of multiple units. Sometimes units will go from A to a point that is sort of close to B (but not really). 

Bots: 2/5
Bots frequently do weird suicidal guerilla rush tactics with the commander unit. Bots are good at challenging players who like to fight off getting rushed (I don't), but tend to stagnate beyond a certain point. It feels like in long games the bots just breaks.

UX (user experience): I hate this game.
As far as I can tell, the thing that Sup Com: FA does differently to other games is scale. At a small scale, this game plays reasonably. On the other hand, I didn't get this game for micro scale RTS fun. I would argue that in 2022 there are much better games for that. In theory this game should make for some pretty epic battles, but it never really seems to go that way. It just feels abrupt and janky. Some things that have soured my experience:
* Getting 1 shot by a nuke because of a mistake made 20 minutes earlier (I.e anti nuke defence has an unfavourable lead time to get up and running).
* End game naval units are painfully slow. In big games, the games always seem to finish before ships ever arrive at their destination.
* Tech scaling: Many of my games have ended because an experimental tier unit will emerge out of the fog of war, and by the time I see it I can't  counter it with anything. It just makes everything feel pointless/redundant. 

Summary: 
Each individual feature/criteria of the game feels like it was either inadequate out of the box or has now been superseded by a newer game. The enormous scale of this game seems to be its primary selling point, but the poor execution of this is what makes the game so frustrating to play. After years of getting frustrated, I sincerely hate this game.",1650051131,1663978825,False,0,2,0.34703749418258667,3,True,False,False

The story is almost non-sensical. The pacing of the game wayy slower than previous entries. Its made intentionally slow. The game removes the research trees that increased the replayability of the game and changed how units behave. Now each building must be teched up individually or build with a teched up engineer, expending mass and energy resources instead of research points, a standalone resource. 

The resource system is changed to be more complicated. You now have resource storage and it fills up or expends based on income modifiers. This means you can stall your economy way easier than past SC titles if you go negative on an income. The game also does a bad job of really showing you in detail your resource expenditures, and its hard to understand why your economy is suddenly tanking. 

The pace of the campaign is so slow. instead of a multitude of quick and fun missions like in SC2, there's like 6 missions that take place on massive maps in phases. It takes a ton of trial and error, because you don't know what the next ""phase"" will bring. You have no intel or heads up about what the end game of a mission will be like, making it hard to create a strong production and economy without making risky decisions. Also there are no faction specific campaigns, you just get to play the 6 missions as each faction.  

Also, as a personal gripe, they removed the Cybran's ""adapter"" unit, one of my favorite units of all time! 

My 15 hours is spend with SCFA was mostly waiting for my economy to develop and slowly building up my base, and wasnt as satisfying as I thought SC2 was.",1655407184,1655407327,False,0,1,0.40595400333404541,0,True,False,False

Sadly the game being fairly aged by now, one may find that it suffers from compatibility issues with current drivers and so on.

So even though the game is technically playable for me at this time, that I guess may not be the case for everyone else.

But it's been a blast to play casually with a couple of friends against the AI. I treat it more as a sandbox to play around with different units and strategies than a game to win - there are just sooo many possible strats!

The good:
- beautiful aesthetic/visuals that still hold up pretty well in 2022
- you can scroll all the way out and manage the game from space
- plenty of variety in units and strategies to keep you busy for a long time
- very satisfying to kill an enemy commander or drop a nuke on their base
- there's a free community tool called Forged Alliance Forever that provides unit balancing, more maps and easier multiplayer

The bad:
- games can be quite long and slow as it takes a while to build up your economy
- so much to do means you can feel overwhelmed a lot, especially when learning it
- if you miss one area, such as building air defence over your base, you can lose from one big air attack from an enemy
- tools are a bit lacking to streamline building, balance your economy or tech properly (eg if you run out of mass there's no way to get a breakdown of which units/buildings are consuming the most mass)

The ugly:
- unit stats are not available from the GUI, so it's guesswork as to which unit you should build sometimes
- UI can be a bit buggy, such as when queuing up multiple upgrades on a factory
- pathing can be really bad at times
- Forged Alliance Forever doesn't work for me, perhaps due to a router issue? luckily steam multiplayer still works fine",1651150994,1651150994,True,6,0,0.5625,1,True,False,False

Once you have the economy set up, the combat begins and there is plenty. Every RTS game I've played, I've never really needed more than 100 units, with Supreme Commander, 100 is the bare minimum for an assault.
OF course if you're like me and don't always enjoy the basic back and forth of assaulting bases, you can simply turtle up with nuke defense silos and artillery.
The number one thing I have to say I love about the game is the size of the maps. Largest is 81 square kilometres, smallest is 5 square kilometres and even the small ones still feel pretty big. You have enough room to really build up and either swarm or turtle up.

Essentially, for point defense there are just more options available - making things more interesting. Plus, I really love the commander battle strat that was more viable back in the old days when you could launch a tactical nuke from your commander's shoulder, have multi-layer sheilding, etc..  So there's alot to enjoy with this game and the skirmish mode can be pretty dang challenging too.

IMO, the campaign was better than supreme commander 2 as well.
I sometimes go back to do the campaign just to play certain maps that I liked.

Does this game deserve your time? I also think yes, but that requires a more elaborate review.

Clearly a very ambitious game, the scale of the battles is monstruous in terms of how many units there can be. Maps in this game can be gigantic, with as high as 12 players on the same match. This means one can have a 6vs6 in this game, and with mods it is possible to have up to 16 players.
In this game, the map IS the territory. The developers make sure to show that to you from the beginning of any game, by demonstrating a zoom-in to an pretty level of detail, from a zoom-out that can go pretty much as far as one wants.

The game's community is still quite active and the interested player may want to have a walk around Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) website.

In summary: this is one of the best videogames of all time. At least try it out, if you have a chance.

That is not all. At the time of writing this review, I had already invested a generous amount of play time in Planetary Annihilation(2015), and Ashes of the Singularity(2016). I have also tried out Beyond All Reason(still in development).
OK, so Supreme Commander is showing its age. But again, there are things that have been done here, that don't seem likely to happen ever again: The support for multi-monitor, the impossible scale of battles, beyond what we've seen in a Total War game, the attention to detail, the factions... this is on another level. This is not something that an indie dev team can tackle. You would need for RTS to become the fashion again, and to allow a team with a crazy project like this to go on for years and years, before we see something that compares. Again, I have tried some of the newer alternatives, and I don't think we will. I'd hope to be wrong, though.

I've been playing this game on and off since I was a kid, first on the xbox (FA isn't on the xbox, just the original SupCom and SupCom 2) then when I got a computer I immediately bought it along with the other two and played all three of them for countless hours, Sadly some hours are lost from either being offline or from an account I had lost a long time ago (and on FAF which doesn't count your hours).

IMO the game is absolutely amazing, If you like RTS's at all it's definitely worth trying, Truthfully its still one of the only good RTS's even after being 15 years old, It's a game I come back to every now and then, I'm still waiting for a successor for this game, A game called ""Sanctuary"" is in development that is supposedly supposed to be the spiritual successor to this game, Truthfully I'm very excited to see its development, They have 3 factions like in the original SupCom, Each of the three remind me of one of the factions in SupCom, EDA for example reminds of of the UEF, the Chosen remind me of the Aeon/Illuminate, and the Guard remind me of the Cybran, I very much recommend checking them out, From what I've seen and heard about the game it will hopefully shape up into something amazing.

Also, If you want a more updated experience of SupCom FA I recommend looking into FAF (Forged Alliance Forever) they have done an amazing job at keeping the game up to date and adding things that improve the quality along with having easy and accessible ways for installing maps or mods not to mentions adding optimizations to help improve late game performance, 10/10 experience for SupCom Fa and FAF.",1453741423,1646101041,True,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Very fun! The gameplay is intuitive and satisfying, simulated ballistic projectiles results in some entertaining mishaps or wins. The AI is very challenging especially early on, requiring you to learn new strategies on the fly to keep up, in both the singleplayer and skirmish modes. On that note the singleplayer is actually very fun and its surprising how much voicework and lore there is in a game that maybe didn't require it, but surely benefits from it. I haven't played many of these games so the whole concept of an economy on the battlefield was a surprisingly welcome addition, and bought in a whole bunch of tactical mechanics you don't really see in other games. 

There are an absolute ton of unique units spread out over the four factions, each with their own specific purpose (so not 20 tanks that all basically do the same thing for the sake of variety), and each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses you can take advantage of. The models, despite the low texture res, are very detailed and look fantastic when you've made your own army and megabase. There's a lot of maps for the multiplayer/skirmish modes and they get crazy big, I think the map size indicator is a little misleading since most of the units in the game are gigantic compared to your regular person, when you see a map that says 80km x 80km it feels closer to maybe 20km in reality, but thats still massive. I didn't touch FAF solely because I didn't want to get stomped by someone much better than me, but I hear its a very pleasant and active community. 

TL:DR 9/10. In Summary this a fantastic strategy, RTS that is a required play for those who enjoy the genre. Whether its $15 or $3.50 like I bought it, PICK IT UP ASAP",1644211691,1644213690,True,4,1,0.582344591617584229,3,True,False,False

The game itself holds up extremely well to the point that it's the only non-officially supported RTS game of its era to be actually growing in player numbers. So if you read this, come join us over at FAF! 

On to the game itself. Only real blemish is that as others have said it really only uses a single thread which means that huge battles can start to stutter a bit. The major point in the game's favor, besides its sheer scale, is the economic system. An RTS in which it's more satisfying to balance your economy outright doesn't exist, as you don't even have to wait to have all the resources to start building anything, it'll just build according to the resources you're generating per tick. When it comes to the scale there's also absolutely no equal: thousands of units on screen, huge robots and experimental tanks, planes and carriers, nukes, insane 500 meter tall artillery guns, there's no end to the CRAZY machinery and ammunition you can throw at one another, all manageable from the single unit, up close, to a view that goes up in space and lets you see the entire battlefield according to your intel.

The learning curve is steep, but instead of being frustrating it mostly means you get more hours out of it, as the more you play the more strategies and tactics you discover. 4 very unique factions add to the variety, with one more, well-balanced major mod faction that seems to be about to be made official. There's also ranked seasons and co-op campaigns. In short, it's more than 10 years old but considering the genre has basically done nothing but regress, it still represents the absolute highest peak rts has ever reached.

[b]Here are some reasons why:[/b]

[list]
[*] [b]Massive and expansive battlefield:[/b] Maps can be as big as 81km is size with 8-12 people with both air, land, sea and even some space elements. 
[*] [b]Hard to master and play:[/b] For new people, there is a learning curve to say the least, but its really fun when you get the basics. But how I would describe this is the game is like a really advance version of chess. There are moves you are always having to make to lead to a decisive victory. That being, involving certain building of units with certain tier levels, economy balancing, recon, etc. Even after many PVP and PVE games, and the completion of the campaign, I am still learning how to play this game well. It takes a lot of strategy, tactics and concentration to play this game well. At least in PVP. 
[*] [b]Continued love almost 10 years later:[/b] The Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) mod lobby is a community of Supreme Commander fans that play together in PVP, PVE and Co-op Campaign to enjoy this game even after all this time. They have not only patched and improve the game in performance and balancing, but they have also added a mod and map vault, lobbies players can host and join with ease, co-op campaign, and more. Incredibly fun and is way better than using the Steam severs to play. Also, its free! I also recommend the LOUD Project Mod for this game. It improves the AI, balancing and game performance drastically - while adding mods & maps that are compatible with the overall mod. I use LOUD now exclusively when playing the game. 
[*] [b]Pretty good graphics & music for its time:[/b] The game has pretty good graphics in my opinion for its time. Its unique art-style outweighs any other RTS I can think of. It isn't cartoony as its more futuristic. It also has great particle effects, explosions, and overall a sense of scale with the units that come with the graphical detail for each one. The sound track for both this game and the first one are amazing. Some really original, adrenaline-inducing songs that can really get you going in the intensity of the battle. Also has some nice casual songs that build up a nice but relaxing atmosphere as you start the game and start building your base. It also seems like its dynamic as battles start happening, so in my opinion, the music isn't worth turning off unless you like to have absolute focus or you are wanting to talk to people over VOIP. Even then I recommend you just simply turn down its volume. 
[*] [b]It still holds up today:[/b] All the reasons I said before, combine into this reason on why this game is one of the best RTS games of all time. If not the best. It still has the longevity that Command and Conquer would dream of or other similar RTS games. It just continues to be awesome. 
[/list]

Overall, I am have glad to update this review to provide some more insight into this game, its a great RTS game for anyone to get into, though its hard to master if you are in any sense a hardcore RTS gamer. If you are casual, prepared to be punished by challenging gameplay, at least in PVP. Even then if you don't know a proper build-order, then the AI might kick your butt. Do buy this game and get the FAF lobby client.

I enjoy this game a lot. RTS games have been my favourite since I first started playing video games. There are many elements that make an RTS game excellent, this catches most, but not all of them. There are some problems which I'll address. 

Cool factor, there are very few RTS games which grip cool factor by the balls like this one does. The mixture of scale, sound design and unit behaviour gives this game a massive and epic feel. An interesting approach to tech sees you starting with small, swarm-like robots which progress into larger machines up until the truly massive, game ending 'experimentals', or tech 4 units. 

Base building, an important component to RTS games that has been tragically reduced as developers sought to capitalise on the success of MOBAs. This game does it very well. Like with units, your buildings progress through 3 tech levels, up until the fourth where you have specialised, faction specific super structures. Bases in this game get big and you're encouraged to spread it throughout the map to secure strategic regions and resources to tech up and increase production. 

Asymmetry/variety is a valid expectation and it can be found here. There are 4 factions and each have their strengths and weaknesses as well as specialised units. The variance is closer to something like Command and Conquer rather than Starcraft. There are staple units across the factions which, whilst different in stats, perform the same role, as well as some unique units which do not have equivalents. It's not ground breaking but it's still good. 

Whilst the strategic elements to the game are excellent, where it falls shorts is in the tactics. Due to the sluggish responsiveness of units and the lag which is common in multiplayer, fine micro is more difficult than it should be. Units often bump into one another, are slow to carry out orders and are generally clumsy. Were this game on a smaller scale, this would be a truly game breaking problem. But, given the large scale and focus on macro, rather than micro, it isn't too great an issue. 

Difficulty wise, this game has a comfortable difficulty curve and a good distribution of players across the skill levels. Its mechanics are intuitive but complex enough to allow for plenty of room for improvement. 

Thanks to the efforts of modders who put together the third party client 'Forged Alliance: Forever', the game lives on in a state far superior and better balanced than it ever was on release. An active MP community exists, coop campaign was added and many quality of life and stability improvements have been added over the years. 

If you like RTS games and are willing to install and make an account for Forged Alliance Forever, I absolutely recommend this game.",1356363992,1640223627,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

If you are somehow familiar with the scene and are not aware of this game, but enjoyed RTS games such as: SC, SC2, Warhammer, C+C, Dune etc,etc.. you should really try it - you will not at all be disappointed.

For me this one is superior to SUPCom2 also which took away many aspects of the ""simulation"" factor to try and cash in on competitive gaming popularity (driven at the time by SC2 and Moba games) and streamlined many components (it has a lot of love also and is not a bad game, but for me not close to this one).",1640106955,1640106955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There isnt a explanation on alot of icons, the options menu shows only a limited amount of controls. The construction menu isnt catorgorized. Thought it common sense to do it like C&C and have a sub menu for defense structures and so on.

Forged Alliance, fixed all of the issues with Supreme Commander and added so much more.

There are even still people out there creating maps for multiplayer.

It's often on sale, so it's only ever going to cost a few pounds... I've played this game since it first came out more than 10yrs ago... and I still come back to it now and again. I got rid of my physical copy years ago, and bought it again on steam because I missed it.

If you played Total Annihilation, this spiritual successor will sate your craving for an intense strategy game. The in-game multiplayer is its only downfall, as the servers and systems are too outdated to support steams current invite system. If you are going to play the game at all, please use the Downlord Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) Client, found online.


[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
The game revolves around your two main resources Mass and Power, you must keep a balance and upgrade your mass extractors when appropriate. Supplying power to your factories and workforce will allow you to continue expanding and producing at a competitive rate. From perfecting your build order; to the mix of units you employ, the defence and attack strategy you decide upon shapes the game on a map by map basis. Each match is utterly unique with fighting armies over tonnes of community made maps (or even a map generator found on Downlords Client). Do you fight with numbers, or technological strength? These are choices that this game will cause you to choose.

[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]
The game suffers from age, but at max settings, it is still beautiful enough to observe your forces cause carnage and explosive conflict. The bloom setting is a personal preference, but it causes some graphics like Shields and Outlines to be unnecessarily bright. Overall the graphics are capable but not world shattering. The explosion effects from your Units being destroyed or destroying other units are quite satisfying, and the blackened burned wreckage left behind in their wake are appropriately illustrated.

[h1]SOUND[/h1]
Jeremy Soule masterfully portrays his score in this title, as he did in the previous game, Total Annihilation. If you were like me, and came from Total Annihilation; knowing what Jeremy was capable of, you are not disappointed when you load in for the first time. I have never been sick of the music playing along against each strategic thought.
The Unit sounds are unique, and generally acceptable to identify what unit you have selected, the sound design is very good with unit to unit combat; firing sounds, explosions etc being a spectacle to behold. Nukes, Artillery shells and Commander explosions are satisfying and the visual effect in combination of a roar of explosive power, you're left in awe of the blackened landscape from the aftermath.

[h1]DIFFICULTY[/h1]
Assuming you're using the Downlord Client to play, the AI are many, and if you so choose, very difficult. you will be tested and shaped into a better player, the harder the AI you play against. There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you master the basics like your initial build, expansion and become familiar with the units of each race; you'll become more adept as you continue.

[h1]TL:DR[/h1]
A reasonably good looking, well paced RTS, with an extensive unit roster means hours of enjoyment. immersive audio and music, will make it very easy to sink alot of hours into this game.

If you would rather see a number to judge your purchase, il rate it as such:

Bit of a learning curve because the economy is more important and complex than in SC2 for example, but it's slower paced and feels much more creative. Absolutely epic with the scale of the fights, the maps and the campaign missions. Some super cool experimental units, nukes and colossal artillery just add to the scale of it. You will not be disappointed trying this game if you like RTS in 2021. Because of the scale, the graphics still seem great, and the heavy CPU loads are less of a problem for modern PCs.

Majority of multiplayer games involve rushing to experimental units by 15 minutes. If a full team invests their resources into making them you lose by minute 15.

It is the same tactic every game. A supposed strategy game where 99% of the units are ignored is deeply moronic.

If  people do not rush here is how it will usually pan out:

Cybran or UEf:

get to the middle of the map build land and spam some t1 mobile artillery. maybe some tanks mixed in.

Okay great...now lets skip straight to t3 units.

Interceptor, maybe a bomber or 2 then skip straight to t3.

The economy in this game is one of the best in the genre, one which SupCom2 fails to uphold. The continuous economy system is great in practice and intelligent in design. Instead of a staggered income like in Starcraft where your resources are tied to workers physically traveling back and forth with an infinite storage, you have resources being aquired per game tick and finte storage. This facilitates building as much as possible when possible.

What is especially unique about SupCom1 is that when spending resources (mass and energy, the only two resources other than time) you don't pay the entire cost the moment you click build. Like the income, your spending is also on a per tick system. This is not only intuitive, it bypasses a lot of the tedium of macroing in other rts games. Instead of being charged upfront for queing 10 units, paying the entire cost of each unit before a single unit rolls out, you que units as you please and get charged the build cost per tick (something like every 1 or 2 seconds, i dunno).

You may think this is inconsequential, but when combined with spare resources in storage, you can build expensive structures or units extremely quickly for as long as you have the resources for it. In that same thought, if you have insufficent storage, you can use your engineers (all purpose builders, repairers, recyclers) to reclaim mass from destroyed friendly and enemy units. After a large battle near your base, it's entirely possible to greatly increase your production per tick if you have engineers get the mass, allowing you to build some costly things for a short time.

The scale for this game is amazing. Unlike in other games where the camera is only ever at a fixed distance, requiring you to pan, click on the minimap, and use hotkeys to snap to places constantly, you can simply zoom out to see the entire map in SupCom. This gives you a better picture of your own army and buildings. Depending on your units' line of sight and sensors or dedicated radar/sonar structures, it's possible to locate every enemy unit and building on the map (barring some gameplay features).

There are several core ideas to fight the enemy SC in the game. All of which involve building a main army, probably consisting of many tier 1 units and a smattering of Tier 2 and Tier 3 units when possible. T1 units are the most cost-effective, after all.

One way to fight the enemy SC is to deny their mass income by destroying Mass Extractors as often as possible. Build a few units and send them out to deny as much mass as possible. This should slow down their production and development slightly. Of course, if they are also destorying your MEs as well, it gets more complicated.

Another idea is to use air transport units to attack structures that are important to the enemy. If your scouts see an undefended Shield Generator, for example, it might be worth dropping some T1 units into it to both deny the enemy SC protection and waste their resources and time by forcing them to rebuild it. It may also be a good idea to prevent large strategic buildings and Experimental units from being completed in the first place. No one wants a constant rain of artillery in their base or a giant death robot massacring their army.

The concepts in this game are inspiring and the execution of it is just so fun. It's clever and avoids some pitfalls or annoyances of other games of a similar genre. I suggest you at least try SC:FA.",1631615333,1631615333,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What makes this RTS game different from the starcrafts and red alerts is the sheer size and scale of the battles and armys/navys/airforces you build.  This game is less of a rock/paper/scissors game of what units beat what as in starcraft and warcraft and more of a game about controlling territory.  The rock paper scissors element is still there as in a bomber will take out a tank, but you will also have anti-air, and your own airforce if you know what you are doing and properly balance out your units.  

If you play this game against friends you will have a blast and if you play competitively it ends up being a real time strategy game of chess where you are trying to kill the enemy commander, the first one to lose their commander loses the game, and since your commander is your most powerful unit in the early game, you will find yourself putting him on the front line constantly playing this balance between expansion and not over-extending as to lose your commander.  As you slowly tech up to more powerful units, your commander becomes less and less of front line unit and becomes more of a unit you need to protect.  In the end game, you have nukes, and experimental units which will end the game very quickly if your commander finds himself face to face with one.  

The concept of the game is simple, control the mass nodes, build mass extractors on them as well as build energy producing buildings, balance out your mass and energy to build units (air,land,sea).  Tech up to get more energy, and more mass, tech up your factories to produce more powerful weapons rinse and repeat until you are in the end game building monkey lords and nukes or until someones commander dies.  

For the price this game costs, I would recommend picking it up, at the very least you will have a lot of fun just playing the computer learning the game.",1631258537,1631258537,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I expected improvements not an unfinished game. Its like the coders never played DUNE 2000 of CNC. NOTHING LIKE COMMAND AND CONQUER generals. I expected different but not unplayable different. 

The zoom in and out is the worst. using the arrow keys throws you all the way across the map. IN CNC you can just click to go where you want.  the first game set on normal took 5 hrs 20 minutes. takes forever to build units. All the while you get pumelled by air from the opposing side. That is at least 10x what you are. no clear upgrade path for tech, it just does it for no reason. I still won but only because the game gives you an unbeatable super cannon near the end and there is a waterway between your base and the bad guys. And the shield generators helped a lot too.

after winning the first round they give you a base to rescue. But you cant build on the other base, or use any of the buildings. So I put some level 3 builders onto light transports and sent about 15 of them to the new encampment and made my own camp.

So i build 20 tanks and 20 mobile artillery and they get taken out by 5 airplanes. Insanely rediculous. It was drudgery waiting for the long build times. Your boats get hit by 3 shots and they sink. But you have to hit their 10 times and they are still firing.  Super unbalanced.

then after saving one base another pops up and a ready made army comes with it. and super alien robots on top of that.

Again i beat it but the interface makes it overly burdensome to play the game and get around on the gameboard. AND this from someone who has played CNC for 12 hours straight with no stress. dont know what I paid for Supreme Conmmander but it was a loss.

And all that was the first game on normal. Couldn't I get one base to start with instead of one and 2 more that dont work. Maybe i missed some settings. 

and then the worst thing games do when you win, there were hundreds of straglers wandering around on the board. and the game session just ends. I hated that the worst. 

Cant i get some relax time building units and hunting down all the straglers? That would have been nice. A gentle game of golf at the end of saving your base. But no. You completed all but one secondary accomplishment (8 out of 9?) and THE END: Session over.

On CNC I play 7 other bases at one time, so its not like I appreciate a challenge. But come on, you have to be able to move around the map and be able to upgrade at least half as fast as your AI.

They did do one thing pretty cool I had not seen. You could click and drag, a missile tower across the map, and it would build as many as it took, to make them like a wall. That is something CNC did not have.

I just switched to a new gaming laptop, I need to find my NO CD upgrade of CNC generals. Of course I own it I own all my games. Only evil people steal. But DRM is stealing my clock speed. Thats a real crime. DRM is the best way to get me to say no to a game (if I can avoid it). My computer My SSD/hard drive. Dont rape my drive.

Forged Alliance is a standalone expansion to the first game which adds a new campaign, new maps in multiplayer mode, new units for the existing factions as well as a completely brand new 4th faction named the Seraphim. 

I cannot say much regarding the lore and campaign of the game as it seems relatively generic and bare. It seems like more of an extended tutorial in order to get used to the mechanics and gameplay to be able to start Multiplayer. 

The variety of units between the 4 different factions makes each match feel relatively fresh as each faction may have different strengths and weaknesses, meaning no faction is objectively overpowered versus the others. I personally enjoy the Cybran faction due to their high damage and cheap experimental units, which are end game units capable of ending games or turning the tide of a game. 

I highly suggest that you download the Forged Alliance Forever client as that is where the majority of the community resides. It's an active match browser and mod installer which allows you to make your own maps as well as download existing ones and play ranked games online. You can also download mods to mess around with such as ones that add entirely new units, new factions or new building types for example. It also contains single player and co-op missions that can be completed as something to do outside of online matchmaking.",1629223576,1629223576,True,3,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

-This came out back in the Windows Vista era, and its poor performance shows.  Expect slow downs during large air battles, or even 2v2+ team games.
-Supcom also tried to expand on its roots from TA, which it did!  But there are newer titles that do an even greater job expanding the UI.  Micro management in particular feels clunky compared to newer titles, such as Planetary Annihlation and games built on the Spring Engine.

-Desync issues in MP
-Can be laggy
-Quite a few crashes and issues with tabbing out

-Active community in Forged Alliance Forever
-Excellent gameplay 
-detailed unit models
-diverse factions with different specialities and quirks
-gorgeous graphics even by today's standards
-passable story
-5 different layers of combat (Air, Ground, Navy, Atmospheric and Tower Defence ) Atmospheric meaning nuclear and anti nuclear combat and tower defence/ offence. (turret creep , horde defence etc)

Campaigns and AI battles eventually got boring, but multiplayer brought me so much fun, new people, tactics and experiences.
With FAF, it's 9.5/10, a game turned into masterpiece in hands of dedicated fans, and the fact it's a 14 year old game, has nothing to do with how good it actually is.

I think some of that has to do with when I first played the game in 2007-2009 --> my PC at the time could barely run it.  Somewhat due to GPU but mostly due to CPU (dual core, not quad & lower IPC).  I mean barely because matches get up to 500 units / team of 8 = 4,000 -- it was the first RTS with real formations, complex patrol routes & battle landscape strategy, yet not completely high level like Total War series.  

This game made Starcraft 2 look like a tinker toy, and yet is only now getting resurgent adoption because hardware is finally able to handle everything (my fav fact: 1-core CPU is dedicated to projectiles -- every bullet / blast is an independent object that can be intercepted / dodged).  I am excited to keep playing today and have an eye on Sanctuary --> which is looking like a legit successor from an Indie dev (Square/Enix bought GPG in 2008, made SC2 in 2010 -- now defunct and has no plans to make another one)

Play this one on Steam or Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) until Sanctuary is out (2022 Q1?).  It is completely worth the money.",1625437855,1625437855,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 Despite being a standalone expansion (if you care not for the continued story) it arguably represents the pinnacle of the entire series. Building on the many positive similarities with vanilla SupCom which made it so memorable in its debut. Like its predecessor it aptly continues to justify ""Supremacy"",""Command"" and ""Epic Proportions"". Funnily enough much from my vanilla thoughts can be applied to FA and so there isn't too much to say if you enjoyed the game play of the former, FA is bound to be a favourite. It pretty much runs on the same basis, with a more refined approach to its the already fan loved formula. The game sets in the same universe after events of vanilla. 

Fa continuous the series goal at redefining the genre of ""real time strategy"". Having the capabilities of generating large scale battles across complex maps. To the simple yet fluid battles that take into account minuscule details from the players input. The ever changing  game state between early-mid-late game transitions; Never is there an idle and if so expect the worst. From the dreaded nuclear launch, the new surprise T4 experimentals, innovative strategies or just a total economic stall. All of it returns.

Iconic features found in SupCom return like the strategic zoom. In addition to many other QoL mechanics. Streamlining of the GUI is a welcomed change as well as the other optimisation tweaks. The expansion does justice to what DLCs fail to do nowadays. Adding non-compulsory lengthy content to an already complete game. A new faction (Seraphim) joins the 3 old ones. Again each with their unique play styles. Familiar units return bundled with more interesting and diverse role units. Larger pool of experimental that are more devastating and worthy as game-ender status. Giving players extra units and structures that add more complexity. Moreover an entire campaign to follow-up the teased ending of SupCom's narrative. Noting many favourite characters return.  

SupCom FA is effectively a polished version of SupCom. Retaining the authentic epic scale and weight of proportions of battling forces. But just more of it. If you loved SupCom, without a doubt, SupCom FA is a natural progression and there just isn't much more to say than that. A critically praised and well received RTS like its predecessor and should not disappoint hardcore fans of the franchise or even genre itself.  In its entirety it chases the same goal of supremacy.

Heading into the series later years most people nowadays play on the Forged Alliance forever client (requires copy of game). A cosy community keeping this ancient treasure alive and updated. A testimony to how tenacious SupCom fans are adorning a RTS franchise that gave more than a retail product price. A true recommendation for fans of the RTS genre. Be wary of the somewhat steep learning curve and required dedicated time needed to play and maybe having to learn. But a worthy price to pay for what great potential can be mined from the series.",1480094379,1624224687,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Even my ASUS Desktop can run this game even though it's not a gaming/high processor PC. its futuristic too so if you like futuristic RTS games I defiantly recommend it. I wont go in to much detail about the game but its basically a continuation from the first Supreme Commander and this version introduces a whole new alien race faction known as the Seraphim. 

If you don't own the original Supreme Commander I recommend getting that too. Both games are by the same creators/developers of Total Annihilation from 1997. That too is a really fun game as well. After CaveDog entertainment dissolved, the devs created Supreme Commander & made a new company known as Gas Powered Games putting the previous head developer and owner Chris Taylor as CEO . In fact Supreme Commander has been announced as Total Annihilation's ""Spiritual Successor.""

What is and has been the best large scale RTS ever is still just as playable in 2021, even multiplayer matchmaking. And that is thanks to its fans. The beautiful people that recognize the brilliance of this game and show it the love it deserves. Notably, the folks over at Forged Alliance Forever. But also the people behind the LOUD Project and a bunch of others.

The Pros:
    
    - Huge maps giving you the ability to try out tactics and strategies on a large scale
    - Nice Cinematics and Story
    - Tutorial
    - Decent Single Player Campaign (Co-Op w/ FFA)
    - Decent Voice Acting
    - Four Different Factions with Unique, Well Balanced Units
    - F****ING EXPERIMENTALS (A butt ton of fun)
    - Land, Air, and Sea Combat on a huge scale
    - Robot corpses all over the battlefield


TheCons:
    
    - Graphics are a bit dated.
    - May never get a true sequel (SC2 was simplified for some reason)

Seriously, this game is a classic and FFA, the LOUD project, and others are proof of that. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. I suggest start with the campaign, then make some custom matches against the AI. When you want more of a challenge, go with FFA and play against more advanced AIs or try matchmaking.

The game and its difficulty is MUCH easier than the game before. You will have help from someone for each mission, with only 1 of them being left on your own for majority of the mission (this might be the only really challenging one). There is no separate story for each faction but instead the same missions with different dialogue and upgrades, depending on your choice of UEF, Cybran, or Aeon. 

Much of the logistics remains the same, with major differences of gunship AA nerfed to the ground (you will no longer be able to shoot down other air units including Experimentals or other gunships with ease like with the UEF T3 Heavy Gunship ""Broadsword"", and nuclear missile launchers and defenses no longer build quickly in the construction phase and also missile building phase. It takes FOREVER... Luckily, heavy artillery installations and Experimental building is a lot easier and quicker to do. Air staging facilities will function automatically (when you set most air units to patrol your base, upon depleting all gas they will automatically refuel and take off if there is an air staging facility nearby, also the more the merrier). Certain units get a look change, some major and some minor. There is more, but those are the one's that have been most helpful. 

More units have been added to the game and they add a substantial change in game-play. Beware of a new faction emerging?! (It is hinted in the name and cover art, ""Forged Alliance"") You cannot play as this new faction during missions by default; however, you can capture enemy engineers as you possibly can and build up an army that way. Fight fire with fire. The Seraphims are a stronger Aeon with many similarities to other factions as well as having their own strong suits. For example, they receive a T3 Heavy Tank that is very strong against other land forces in large groups and are capable of firing torpedoes when submerged and are the ONLY faction to feature a T3 Submarine Hunter and T3 Battleship that can launch nukes. Give it a go to capturing them and unleashing their own toys against them. 

This is the ""last"" installment by THQ for Supreme Commander. Supreme Commander 2 is the last and final game, though it is not made by the same creators and has a different layout. Getting it is your entire choice. It does continue off and supposedly brings the fight to a final end, where Aeon, Cybran, and UEF finally coexist in (mostly) peace.",1622751617,1622751617,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

El modo campa√±a tiene una historia entretenida y amena, derivando de los acontencimiento de la primera entrega se unen las tres grandes superpotencias para combatir al enemigo com√∫n, los seraphim unos seres venidos de otra dimensi√≥n con el objetivo de aniquilar a toda la humanidad... pero por supuesto las guerras intestinas no tardan en aparecer y los disidentes se multiplican...

Pero lo que m√°s horas de juego me ha dado ha sido el modo multijugador: este tienen distintos objetivos, pero el m√°s com√∫n consiste en aniquilar al comandante enemigo (modo m√°s popular) para lograrlo deben controlarse los puntos de masa y producir energ√≠a para construir unidades y estructuras cada vez m√°s avanzadas pertenecientes a 4 niveles tecnol√≥gicos, cada uno incrementando la potencia destructora y el alcance de los niveles anteriores hasta los afamados y deseasdos experimentales, enormes  y devastadoras m√°quinas de guerra que son la guinda del pastel. 

Construye posiciones de artiller√≠a fija para proteger el avance da la imparable ola de tropas terrestres producidad en tus f√°bricas de guerra mientras tu flota de cruceros hostiga de manera implacable sus edificaciones. 

Descubre que han infiltrado a un peque√±o grupo de unidades de Nivel 3 aerotransportado que  han aprovechado un hueco en tu defensa antiaerea debido a que has tenido que derivar cazas para protegerte de un bombardeo en otra regi√≥n.
Utiliza el sonar y avista un submarino que tiene capacidad de producir misiles estrat√©gicos nucleares al coraz√≥n de tus infraestructuras, y env√≠a a tus ingeniero a la construcci√≥n de escudos antimisiles en prevenci√≥n de dicho desastre
Mientras aceleras la construcci√≥n de tu masivo bombardero experimental...
Pura tensi√≥n, pura diversi√≥n!
En cuanto a la jugabilidad: Permite dejar colas de producci√≥n, establecer patrones de patrulla, repetici√≥n en colas de producci√≥n de fabricas y movimiento de unidades, etc
Respecto a los gr√°ficos es un juego del a√±o de la polca, pero sigue soportando el paso de los a√±os sobre el y son decentes para los est√°ndares actuales. 

Lo mejor: Las unidades est√°n impecablemente dise√±adas. Ejemplo los barcos acorazados disponen de ca√±ones de largo calibre debastadores para objetivos de tierra, ademas de ametralladoras contra misiles de crucero y un pu√±ado de ca√±ones flak antiaereos para proporcionarle cierta cobertura antiaerea, es decir tiene un rol en mente pero le permite defenderse y apoyar en otros roles para los que otros barcos o unidades est√°n mejor preparados. 
Lo peor: La cantidad de horas que puede llegar a comerse este juego en una partida (1h quiza 2h si es una partida especialmente dura).

En definitiva si quieres un juego de estrategia completo y con un grado de complejidad intermedio-alto, pruebalo... no podr√°s dejarlo. ;-)",1621629236,1621629236,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are massive performance improvements and a wonderful AI with a variety of options to tailor the difficulty to suit all comers.

First match vs the AI and he dropped 5 air transports of tier 2 units on my commander, i was able to over charge them all down but it put me into the yellow on my health bar, I was very impressed and marvelling at how cool that was when the follow up T2 fighter bomber comm snipe finished me, it was amazing, what a fantastic way to die.

What makes this game so great? Well many things really but if you had to summarize, one word, scale. Everything from the numbers of units and their utilisation and weaponry to the maps themselves. Virtually all RTS confine you to a bordered combat areas but the maps themselves feel large in Supcom. Even its occasionally awkward pathfinding mechanics add to the sense of scale in this game. 

The economy follows on in the same vain as Chris Taylors earlier RTS title, Total Annihilation, where by players mine mass from specific areas of the map and generate energy from power generators that they build.  On the face f it, it doesn't sound that unique but the economy balancing is a very different mechanism to those employed in other titles and adds an extra depth of play in an area that other games have historically overlooked. 

Let me be clear, the game has a steep learning curve and there are some technical issues (such as the lack of multithread utilisation) that you would expect to find in an older game. But there is no question in my mind that only really special games to play and even watch, manage to amass such a loyal following that still pulls in thousands of players to this day.",1589313110,1616693168,True,4,0,0.509313821792602539,0,True,False,False

A couple months later a friend told me there is a mod called FAF that keeps the multiplayer alive. Downloaded the faf client and slowly started playing some games. It was nice but I wasn't really hooked. In Summer 2019 I joined a small clan and started playing a bit more competitively. Thats when the proper fun started. Now after over one year and probably 2000 games the game starts to make sense to me. I am able to recognize good gameplay and see beauty in it. Kind of similar like a mathematician sees beauty in a proof. 
Getting to the point where you feel like you are in control of the game (not the oponent) takes a lot of training. I don't feel like I am there yet. Maybe noone is there yet. But that is in my opinion where the game shines. The skill ceiling is incredibly high not because of a lot of mini tasks you have to perform but because the game is so complex and most maps are so large/ complex. 
The good news for begginers is that it is already great fun to play non competitively. The graphics have aged incredibly well and everything feels very well refined. All the guns have the right amount of weight to them. You can easily see that it was a true AAA RTS game when it was developed. And now finally the cpus have caught up to the incredibly high demand of the simthread hammering one core. You should definetly have a cpu that is post Haswell (intel 4th gen). 

But a review of this game isn't complete without talking about the reason it is still played: Forged Alliance Forever. It took over the multiplayer after GPGs own multiplayer service shut down and now continues to shape the game with balance updates, minor graphical improvement and recently a reworked net code that improved the multiplayer experience a lot.
The community is mostly friendly. Ofc there are some black sheep everywhere. For a beginner I would recommend to play the campaign missions first. It is decent and after that you should know most units. Diving into multiplayer can be a bit rough. You might get kicked from lobbies because of you little games, aka having a rating that shows gray. And unfortunately most of the toxic player are in the low rated Astrocraters and Dualgap maps, which are basically the only maps hosted by lower rated people. Don't worry it isn't even close to 2013 LOL levels of toxicity. Just not actively welcoming. I suggest to start hosting your own lobbies as soon as possible.
If you need technical help or tips to improve your gameplay you can ask in the FAF forum and on the FAF discord server. The techsupport usually is very good because it is top level tech support. Gameplay tips wise it can be kind of a mixed bag. There is a chance your question will start a heated discussion amoung the veterans who will argue about nuances and not really answer your question. But if you are determined to get better you usually will find someone who will train you personally. 

The active faf community is small enough that you will recognize most players in your lobby after a while. So to me it starts to feel more and more like a small village.",1612883940,1612883940,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

New units added to the three previous factions that enhance their tool set, but perhaps the most significant addition to the game in terms of units is the additional 4th faction, the Seraphim. 

In the previous game, you could play as one of three human factions, the Cybran Nation, the Aeon Illuminate and the United Earth Federation (UEF for short). Here, you can now play as the Seraphim, a truly alien faction in every sense of the word. However, they are only playable in multiplayer and skirmish modes. They take up the main antagonist role of the campaign, with a number of other characters from each of the three human factions serving as lesser antagonists. Honestly though, the story isn't really worth getting into because it doesn't have much impact despite the heightened stakes compared to the first game. Supreme Commander as a franchise has never been particularly impressive from a story-telling perspective, but the missions are fine enough to help you get adjusted to the new UI improvements, as well as the new units. 

A word of advice to anyone interested in buying this game; get both of them, the first game and this one. I say this because, while Forged Alliance is considered a stand-alone game in it's own right, it's still an expansion to the first game. If you're interested in the story (like myself admittedly), then definitely get the first game. More importantly, the first game has a good tutorial that teaches you the basics of the control scheme, something shared between both games. Not to mention, the campaigns in the first game does a slow-burn kind of pacing, where you unlock new units as the campaigns progress. 

Forged Alliance unfortunately drops you right into the action with access to mostly everything at once, and the only new units to unlock are the ones added in this game. It's not a bad thing, but it can be jarring considering the fact that the mission maps in the Forged Alliance campaign become enormous as the match drags on. You'll generally start out in a small area where you'll have to build up a base, destroy the first batch of enemies nearby and have a functioning economy to support yourself before continuing onward. You can complete your objectives as quickly or as slowly as you want, the game doesn't penalize you for time elapsed aside from reminding every so often of your current objective. There are timed objectives yes, but mercifully not many of them. The real problem is just trying to get your armies across the battlefield quickly due to how huge the maps become. 

Another thing, if you noticed how I said the first game has more campaigns, then that's true. Each campaign focuses on a different faction, with you (the player) fighting in the closing days of the galaxy spanning war consuming all three groups. The three campaigns are distinct from one another, but there is some overlap here and there. In Forged Alliance, it's one campaign, but you can choose to play as one of the three human factions in each one, basically replaying each mission with a different set of tools at your disposal. 

Moving on from the campaign, the game play is solid and rather intricate once you've had time to adjust to it. I won't cover everything here, otherwise I would've made a guide rather than a review, but here's the gist of it: In most matches (barring some campaign missions), you start with nothing as you're teleported to the battlefield in your all-purpose Armored Command Unit (ACU). The ACU is the lifeblood of your army and arguably the most important weapon in your arsenal, able to build bases and engage enemy armies. The ACU is strong on its own, but as the game drags on, more advanced forces are fielded and it becomes increasingly dangerous for the ACU to fight enemy forces. You can upgrade the ACU to make it more effective in battle or more effective at building bases and supporting your economy. Eventually however, you can build expendable sub-commanders who are somewhat more effective in combat than an un-upgraded ACU, but a better alternative all-around for a front line general if there's no other option. 

When building bases, you have to keep note of several major factors: factories, production and defense. Nearly all buildings come in three tech levels and all buildings can be built by your ACU, your sub-commanders, but more commonly by your engineers. Each engineer and every unit is split between these three tech levels and only engineers of a specific tech level can build something from that level. Higher tech engineers can build lower tech stuff as well. 

Most maps in the game let you build all three types of units, but not all of them have water (or in some cases, not enough water), so you'll have to make due where you can. On all maps however, you'll have to scramble to acquire mass nodes, because without mass, you won't be able to build anything efficiently. You can build energy production facilities anywhere on the map and without energy, you won't be able to power defensive structures like shields, radar and stealth generators, or produce bases as efficiently. 

Unlike other RTS games out there, you don't send out builders or dedicated collector units to obtain funds to purchase things with. Instead, you work toward building enough economy structures so that your mass and energy output isn't exceeded by your spending. You can build anything, but you're managing your build speed instead of your battlefield finances. In other words, as long as the bars at the top right of your screen are full, or at least, not empty, then you're good to go with construction.

Lastly, you have to bear defense in mind. It's entirely possible to never have to build defensive structure throughout the course of a game, but this usually isn't a good idea from my experience and from seeing other people try this. None of your defenses, barring shields and the like, use energy, so you can build as many as you need. But bear something else in mind; the placement of your defenses is as important as the kind of defenses you build. This game has some really awesome physics and projectile tracking, which leads to a lot of fun to be had. None of the weapons in the game are hit scan, so units fighting one another won't instantly hit when they fire their weapons at each other. If a hill is in the way, then unless the unit in question can fire over it, those shots will be wasted. Missiles also work this way and I've seen quite a number of what would have been sure-fire hits fail because they hit the very tip of a mountain or exploded prematurely against the upraised terrain. 

Speaking of AI, the worst thing that could be said about it is path-finding. Good lord, the path-finding in both games is horrendous, especially when you want your army to move around a corner. Many can say they hate Supreme Commander 2 all they want, but if you ever try to deny the fact that game fixed the path-finding issues a thousand fold, then I literally don't know what to say about you. Right, this is supposed to be a positive review. 

Ultimately, this is a game about grand scale strategy, managing a truly unique battlefield economic system, all while building up armies of robots, tanks, air planes and battleships to destroy your enemies with. Buy this game because it's a solid experience on its own, then download the Forged Alliance Forever third party client to do online play and get access to a great selection of mods. Buy the previous game to get a complete experience and consider buying the sequel because it does have some merits that outweigh its problems.

This is my all time favorite game. theres a lot to say

Units
Loads of different units. All of them are awesome, cool, fun to use and look awesome. There's always an abundance of choices and plenty of different way to play. Even naval combat is fun. taking battleships and blowing up naval bases (and even parts of the enemies land) is always fun. 

Variety
Plenty of it. This game has everything from the first Supreme Commander game and added more to it. Incluiding a new faction. Each one may have similarities but theres a lot of different distinctions. The Aeon for example has slow firing units, but they have the most range and they deal heavy damage. Cybran has much faster, lazer shooting enemies and uses stealth units to execute surprise attacks. UEF has explosives and machine gun combos. Seraphim has a combination of all of those (sorta). BTW the new units added are very good and do make game changes.

New Players
If you played the 1st Supreme Commander game, you can go into this pretty easily, but for new players? not so much. Not only does this games story continue on from the 1st game, but when you start, you have all the units from the first game and new units for each level. Theres a tutorial, but it only covers UEF and the very basics. Though, it did improve a lot in unit descrptions so at least new players know what it does.

UI
Very clean easy to understand. Unit capabilities are defined well, each option for the units is easy to use and understand (unless your completely new), each attacking unit now has a defined attack range instead activating all at once or none at all, theres not an overabundance options but there is plenty to use. Its well made.

Addiction
This is one of those games where you can lose track of time because of how immersive it is. I can spend hours in one play session because seeing the progression, the firepower, the scale of it all, is breathtaking. I always want to keep playing because i am doing so much and watching so many things that it holds my attention.

Grind
There really isnt any grinding unless you count resource management. Each factory, builder is restricted by their tier so you only have to upgrade factories to get higher tiers. The factory will also decrease time for lower tiers after an upgrade. You cant stack engineers on factories for even faster unit production, and you can stack engineers when building as well to create buildings faster. Of course, if you cant manage the resources either it will slow to a crawl or just take the same amount of time as a regular build (thats if you stop stacking and your resources arent still being drained)

Multiplayer
This game's mulrtiplayer is no longer existant since GPGnet is dead, BUT there is a mod called Forged Alliance Forever which has brought back the multiplayer and it is very much alive.

Campaign
It is fun to play (the story isnt engaging, but the gameplay is), depending on which faction you paly, you can obtain different side missions, some dont make any real changes, others can give you an advantage in battle. The friendly ai is very weak and barely helpful. When you first start out, they are ok but later on, they dont make any real changes. Thankfully there is a mod that increased unit cap, makes friendly ai way more useful and adds new friendly ai that doesnt exist in the base game. here's a link if youre interested: https://www.moddb.com/mods/forged-alliance-enhanced-campaign-ai

I've enjoyed this game since it came out and i still enjoy it today. Its one of the best RTS games ever made and i reccomend this game especially if you like RTS

I grew up playing and loving classic RTS games, my favorite of which was always Total Annihilation. I remember fiddling with the Spring Engine back when that was a thing, a community project that was largely used to create an open-source true 3D successor to the original Total Annihilation. Then, I discovered a new RTS game that was on the horizon, called Supreme Commander. The familiar layout of starting out with a lone commander unit, now called the ACU looked uncannily familiar and immediately rekindled my nostalgia for TA. I later found out that it was made by the same creator, and that it was truly the spiritual successor & evolution of my beloved childhood favorite. It featured the same core game mechanics of a lone, powerful start unit whose survival is key to your yours as the player, but was built up to an absolutely massive scale and mechanically fine tuned & polished.

Then, when I thought it couldn't get any better, the stand alone DLC Forged Alliance released. I truly love the era of standalone RTS DLCs that take one of your favorite games and make it even better, adding new content and polishing the existing game. This is one of the finest examples of such releases, as Forged alliance added a fourth faction to the game with its own complete list of units while also expanding existing faction unit rosters, and also added new maps. In addition to this, it also introduced balancing measures that made match-ups between units more sensible, and made progression through the tech tree in the game more smooth and fluid. And to polish all of that off, the in-game UI was revamped and slimmed down.

The interface in this game is still what I consider par for any base building & battle RTS, and is still at the top of my list in terms of controls & interface, balance between micro and macro focused strategic gameplay, and time and size scale. The way units behave in game (especially how they move and shoot at the same time, yes I'm looking at you StarCraft), and the way this game forces players to focus on effective macromanagement & strategy while giving them a buttery smooth and intuitive control interface that takes a lot of the pain out of micromanagement to do so is, in my opinion, simply unmatched by any other RTS game. 

The game is just a boat-ton of fun with friends in multiplayer, or alone in skirmish against AI, the options for which feature a healthy variety of difficulty levels and play styles. The map variety offers fast-paced, in your face brawling action or massive scale multi-hour slugging matches with other players or AI, which coupled with adjustable game speed offers any speed or time frame of gameplay desired. It also features a decent single player campaign that is a great way to learn the game mechanics & controls as well as a bit of strategy. 100% recommend, worth picking up at full price, ABSOLUTELY worth picking up when on sale.",1606966152,1606966152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, if you enjoy building endless waves of units to wash upon the rocky shores of annihilation, while also slowly building up your primary commander unit or waiting to deploy higher tiered units capable of taking more than a single shot from enemies base defenses, then this might the game for you.

Graphics: Decent considering the age (nothing too mind blowing but maxed out the graphics are fine for an RTS game)

Not only does this game feature a real time aspect, but expands upon the true idea of strategy, often forcing players to be adaptive in their approach to taking down several computers. 

The resources are basic to understand much like Starcraft in that there are only two, Mass and Energy, both which are required to build structures, units and to maintain buildings as well, adding a unique economy system to challenge the player every time. 

With three distinct factions and an added faction, this game beats Starcraft 2 hands down, simply for the fact they added a new faction with the expansion of the base game.  I've featured some description of their features but not all.
- The Aeon look like humans but are very defensive ( good shields ) with some awesome mega weapons ( Mega robot thing and flying saucer )
 - The Cybran are cyborgs that sound like Soviets lol with a deadly arsenal of offensive units, ( particularly ships that walk on land )
- The Ceraphim are crazy inter-dimensional beings with a very healthy balance of offensive and defensive units, they also have some of the strongest battleships in the game and strategic missiles that are tough to destroy.
- The UAE are the humans, like Terran from Starcraft they are balanced in all areas and feature the classic destructive specials like a rolling fortress and artillery canon. 

The maps can be huge if you want them to be, i mean pick the right one and you could have a two hour slugging match with the AI, your trusty bestfriend struggling by your side, well on another island that is lol A great array of land and naval maps for sure.

Resources are virtually unlimited, and experimental units rule the battlefield.  The campaign allows you to choose one of three factions, with individual units and structures.  The main challenge in campaign mode is that, on each map, there are objectives which, when accomplished, enlarge the map with a new base and often a huge incoming wave of enemies.  So it helps to play through once, and you can preposition units to stem the tide (it becomes trivial if you position experimentals at choke points, and enough anti-air and shields to protect your main base).

I think this is the first in the series to have the modern RTS control conventions.  The AI is weak in campaign mode, it doesn't often rebuild even when you give it the opportunity, never expands, and attacks with small groups that are easy to defend.  If you like to build your base and turtle up, it will give you the time to do that.

Every other RTS feels like small skirmishes by comparison even to this very day, and it isn't because of just the scale of this spiritual successor to Total Annihilation.

You truly have so many options to try to win in this game--so many ways to scout, to harass or distract your enemy.  You can fight wars of attrition, or overwhelm your opponent's defenses with sheer numbers or by an experimental mega-weapon.  Base defenses and artillery have ranges that are meaningful.  The latter can be screenfuls in distance-- they feel like artillery and not just some guns that have trouble lobbing a shell a few feet out.  Strategic artillery can even lob shells directly from your base to your enemies' bases across the map.  And if all else fails, you can launch strategic air strikes to knock out your enemy's nuclear defenses and then nuke them.

But this is not a twitch RTS where success is measured by clicks per second.  You have many ways to win, but resources are limited and you must choose a balance between how much you build/expand, how many units you produce, and when to push for more territory.  You need to study your enemy, to send scouts to see what they are up to and be prepared to counter it.  This is a thinking, strategic RTS where the big picture matters, not individual units.  You are not trying to micro manage units like a MOBA.

For me, SupCom towers beyond every other RTS that has ever been made--including the popular ones like Warcraft, Starcraft, Command and Conquer, etc.  And that is not to say that those others are bad games, I enjoyed playing them-- but SupCom allows for that open-ended creativity that the other games do not have.  Yet... this game is not perfect.

First, this game can severely tax your computer.  If it is not powerful enough, the game can drag to a crawl.

Second, there are only two resources in this game, metal and energy.  And unlike other games where the emphasis is on the amount that you have, in SupCom you have effectively unlimited metal and unlimited energy-- its their production rate that matters.  The rates you produce these resources become limits to the rate you can build and expand.  Which is good, but the bad thing is that maps become pretty bland after a while.  No amount of trees or other elements of a map matter as where are those metal spots happen to be.  Metal locations, water, and terrain height matter--but nothing else really does.

Third, games can really last for hours.  Which can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes.",1604392240,1604392391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story: Well despite my love for this game the story is very simplistic but I don't think it was ever really the focus of the game and it serves as basicly a device to introduce the new race. 
Gameplay: Its amazing with great control. It is very hard to learn but once you do you will learn to love it. All of the races have their own unique quirks and abilities that suit many play styles. There are so many ways to build and expand with lots of options. 
Maps: Honestly haven't played them all but so far as I can tell there great with lots of ways to play and expand.
Graphics: There not as good as a lot of other RTS's but for 2007 i'd say there good. There is a ton and I mean a TON of cliping and that's it, i'd say there fine nothing to go crazy over but fine.

But I largely stopped playing new games early 2000's: C&C Generals: Zero Hour and Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne were my last new games, and I kept playing them right up until I got a steam account in 2020.

You see, I'm a Linux user. And very busy. So games are both a bit harder to run than for most, and I'm not THAT interested. I play usually two to three times a month for an afternoon or so. Never online: always against AI! But in 2020, I built a new computer with a juicy new AMD RyZen. And due to a nice bonus from work, I decided to throw in a mid range video card (RX 5500). I would've added my old GeForce 6600 otherwise, enough to play Warcraft II and Generals... But now I had something to that could do more. And I wanted to give it a go.

I was actually looking for Total Annihilation. Wanted to play that again - had good memories. But the Steam store recommended SupCom which was just 1.99 due to a promotion. Hard to say no, so I decided to give it a go.

Love. At. First. Sight.

What a game. Perfect! played the campaign, in the wrong order (started with Aeon) and when done, Forged Alliance was next.

The story is perhaps not amazing, but the way it is integrated in the campaign, the size of the levels - it is all awesome. The game pulls you in, giving you new challenges. A Turtle like myself who loves to be as efficient as possible can minimize game speed & tune everything. Lovely.

If you like the original SubCom, FA is simply more of the same. There is 0 downside, seriously. There are a few more units, a slightly improved UI, but that's it. The campaign is better. More challenging, especially after the first few operations the AI starts to harass you more so you are forced to balance base building with defense. Lovely! Build those shields, quick!

[h2]Basics[/h2] 

Now there are a hundred reviews and fan pages on SupCom, so I'll leave it to them to describe how the game goes, but the very basics are as follows.

You're dropped in a big robot on a small map. You have to order the robot to build some buildings, including resource generation and unit production. There are two resources: energy, which goes up and down quickly, and mass, which is much slower to generate and use. Unites come in three basic varieties: land, air and water.

Once you have some units, you need to go over to the base of the [b]other[/b] commander and kill it/them.

That's it in a nutshell. There are many complications, from different types of units, building upgrades, super units, stationary weapons like cannons and nukes, but that's all additional fun.

What makes the game unique in the genre is it's user interface. Or, one element of it. In other games like the Starcraft, Warcraft and C&C franchises, you have a combination of 'local view' where you're managing a small number of units, and a 'map' or 'radar' where you see the world. You can zoom in a bit on the action, but only a little in or out. Not in Supcom. The scroll wheel zooms you out until you see the entire battlefield, and back in until you see a single unit. Need overview? Zoom out. Need details? Zoom in! It's SUPER intuitive, and honestly so superior I'm surprised the others haven't copied this. Well, not like anyone really still makes strategy games anyhow... it's 2020, when did the last good strategy game come out? Maybe Starcraft II - I didn't play it, but even that game is years old by now. Everybody plays MMO's these days, first-person shooter or top-down RPG style with fast action and no base or resource management. Eliminated that overhead! I get it.

Back to SupCom. Is it that bad if you are used to Overwatch?

The game has a tutorial and a campaign to guide you through the base building and management process, but if you don't have much patience, this won't be your game. Resources and efficient base management, handling multiple unites etc - you are busy with, well, strategic choices. Fast action is important if you play online, against the computer (as I prefer) you have to be efficient, deliberate and can take (some) time to decide by slowing things down.

If you're into all that, though, dozens of fun hours are guaranteed. Enjoy!",1602755680,1602755680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Back then, it was the gateway drug that pushed me into the genre. I pandered around through Starcraft II, Age of Empires, Red Alert 3, Company of Heroes, you name it. I always had this pressing notion that since Sup Com was my first RTS, and that it was so good, that there just HAD to be more like it out there in boat loads.

Through time I started to realize that there has never been an RTS created of this caliber... Ever. The funny thing is that, though this game is undoubtedly the best in the genre, the only reason why it doesn't have a super saturated E-Sports market or anything of the sort is probably just due to the fact that it's massive and ""slower paced"". But it's not, it's better executed than SC2 for making you feel like you have an actual army to use instead of force-channeling your ADHD to kite marines. Also, stalemates don't exist. If nukes don't work, use artillery, if that doesn't work (it will work), spam experimental units, or all three, blow up the entire map. Someone will always lose.

The follow-up to that is that it's not clicks-per-second. You set build orders for your engineers/command unit and predict what the enemy will do. If every other RTS is checkers, this is Chess.

Overall its a solid rts game where quantity matters in the early phase, shifts to expansion phase where you builds as much as you can,and ends with the brawl of titans. 

the maps are great for many variety of gameplay (defense or offense), skirmishes AI are merciless but you can pick a specific behavior for them which is a very cool feature for rts game.

This game is slightly outdated at this point, and there are several performance hiccups, but there are many communities still supporting this game, such as Forged Alliance Forever. The LOUD mod is supposed to improve the sub-par AI performance issues that cause late-game slowdowns/crashes, even on rigs that should be able to easily handle this game. In addition, there are many mods out there that make this game extremely fun to play, adding units and upgrades, UI overhauls, etc.

NOTE*- Play the first game if you want the Single Player experience, it's worth it.

Pro's

The extended zoom immediately gives you an extra layer of strategic control it's really fun to handle so many units in different places.
Unit roster is intense, each side has a varied as well as a specialised list of units.
Experimental units are really fun, some of them have serious strategic value.
An underwater Aircraft Carrier!
Naval battles in this game are the best I've seen, they can last hours, the same goes for land and air of course.
Nukes, Anti-Nukes and Super Nukes!
Enjoyable Campaign.
Replayability against AI.
A reminder that RTS is not just about point, click and shortcut keys.
An all round quality RTS.

Cons

The campaign for this one is not as big as the first game.

Scope

So out of all the RTS out there this is my favourite, I've been playing RTS since DUNE 2 (the original) and there is nothing like this one. The way it steps away from 'Tactical RTS' to 'Strategic RTS' is worth a look for any RTS fans out there.  It has many hours to give with the campaign alone, fighting AI is also very fun if you setup a custom match to your own taste. You can still play online but need to download FAF (check guides) and this is a lot of fun as people do still play. 

If you need to burn some time for fun and like RTS then honestly check it out.

Once more, if you like campaigns in RTS then try the first game as it's a good story arch and fun to follow.

9420,71597078,76561198016649422,0,5,3366,0,1676,1690245197," FYI - My Steam hours are low because I bought this on CD when it came out. 

 Called the best RTS ever made for a reason, from small quick battles all the way to huge hours long maps.  Easy command interface.  All units and projectiles exist in the world, a cannon shell can hit a tree instead of you.  Tons of replay value, and an online community still exists in 2020.

  A few things that set it apart for me:

1:  The factions do not have identical units and base structures that can be built, versus ones where the ""look"" is different but the units are just clones for ""balance"".  Yet they are close enough that one side is not OP.   The game has an appropriate level of balance among factions.

2:  No limits on Super Weapons.  That's right, if you want 300 Strategic Nuke launchers you can.  You like that Submersible Aircraft Carrier and wan't a few to swarm the base with 800 fighter/bombers, you can.  You need to figure out a way to survive that long but there are no unit-type restrictions, just an overall unit cap.

3:  You are a Commander and can assign tasks to your units and let them go, instead of micro-managing the assault and staging.   You can tell two factories to make 300 medium and heavy ground units and tell those units to stage at an island across the map.  If you support the factory, with one click, with air transports they will automatically fill to capacity and fly all ground units to the island.  You don't have to load each unit, assign flight paths etc.

4:  The diverse unit availability means different speeds.  With one click you can assign any unit type to coordinate an attack time and strike simultaneously instead of personally managing each unit to get it where you want when you want.

5:  Strategy is completely up to you.  Snipe with artillery, Swarm, Naval Bombardment, Flank and Rush, come up with anything and give it a try.


  The game really lets you play different strategies, that can win, instead of a single attack method that works best for X-Faction, or Y-faction.  It's cheap these days and you can lose thousands of hours playing a quality RTS so why not drop some coin on it.

I have thousands of hours played on this game on Xfire (when it was a thing) and on GPGnet (before servers were shutdown) This is the only game, that I've played on tournament level and the only RTS that I've ever made real money off on tournaments. I've played it... a lot.

Match length greatly varies according to map sizes. 5x5/10x10 took 30 minutes to couple hours. 20x20+ could be something like couple hours to 4+ hours. I've even played a 8+ hour FFA game on Betrayal Islands, which is the longest match I've ever played in my life. Good luck trying to have a toilet break or anything of the like, in a game like that.

This game is all about long-term planning and adjusting to your opponents movements and plans. There is no short term ""I'm going to build a unit to counter this"" Or ""I'm going to press this ability to counter this"" You have to have (in most cases) a correct army/navy/fleet composition to counter the things they are meant to counter and it takes time, a ""long"" time to build them. Those unit groups are your ""tools"" and ""abilities"" and then comes your own tactics, build orders and how you group up your units. which greatly varied from person to person. By the time you see something unexpected that can end you, it WILL end you, usually...

There are just so, SO many layers of difficulty and strategy in this game, that raises it above all the rest. Every faction is truly unique, aesthetics, weapons, strengths and weaknesses, culture and ideology and most of all, [b]units and structures[/b]. These do NOT look, feel and play the same as the other factions. 

UEF has the only T3 Point Defense in the game and almost all the tools other factions have. Cybran has the best Experimental in the game (or well most cost effective), it's tier 3 Air units have homing missiles and they are also stealth (other factions have projectiles that can miss) Aeon has the most cost effective (and unique) way of defending from tactical missiles and most of their units hover. Every faction is truly special in this game, in so many ways, that I can't possibly put them all here.

UEF is the most versatile of all factions. Their units can handle almost anything other factions throw at them and hit them back, just as hard and they are best defensive faction in the game by far, slowest units in the game. Cybrans is all about low hp, high mobility, stealth and high damage, rapid firing units (except Brick, which is an exception to their whole unit roster and discipline for some strange reason) Aeon has units, which are very specialized at their roles. They have slow, heavy hp/shield units which take damage but have short range weapon, which is also a heavy hitting, slow firing weapon but they also have fast, long range, accurate, slow firing, high accuracy units that have low hp but high damage. They cannot go toe to toe with most of their units on their own, but they have some units that can take damage and deal with close range enemies as well while other units excel in long range. In short, with other factions you can use most of your offensive units to do a push, but with Aeon, you have few of those units that can do that, but a lot of units that shouldn't do that, because it's not cost effective. 

[b]Theeeeeen[/b], we have the Seraphim, the ""Worst"" faction in the game. Most expensive units, ""Best"" units, most of them are multi role, not very cost effective at their roles but they do their jobs very well. Second best (or best, depending on player) experimental unit in the game and then best game ending experimentals in the game. Only faction with T3 sub hunter, which is also ship hunter, which also has the best naval AA weapon in the game embedded on it, making it a nightmare to counter in high numbers. T3 Battleship can launch nukes, ""cheapest"" game ending experimental bomber, which is near impossible to prevent, without having at least one player dedicating their entire economy on it, Experimental Nuke WILL end the game in couple seconds or couple of minutes, depending on the amount of nuke defenses and is the most versatile at both attacking and defending, while other game ending experimentals will take about 10 times more time to do that, giving other player chance at destroying it. Absolute nightmare in team matches if people are coordinating and playing to their strengths while covering up seraphims weaknesses.

I could write an essay about this game and how good it is and what a fricking shame it is, that we have nothing like it at the moment and there probably are no plans whatsoever to ever make something like this again because, it is a game that is truly unique from others. This game truly is [b]LARGE[/b] in scale, compared to others. It truly meets the definition of a real time [b]strategy[/b] game. It is not a perfect game by any means (nothing ever is), but it is the one that I truly loved and played, that still has a special place in my heart.

Goddamnit Chris Taylor, get a new funder or publisher or whatever and make a new game like this and please STAY FAITHFUL to the original and make it even better than the one before. I don't know, or care, how you will accomplish it, but there's at least one hardcore, faithful fan still awaiting that ""one"" game to come out. A truly worthy sequel to the Supreme Commander...

Oh and don't even mention Supreme Commander 2. Supreme Commander 2 is a joke, don't you dare mention that SupComLite to me. It still burns my very soul to see, that it has the very words ""Supreme Commander"" in it. May god strike down the publisher, that forced them to make it that way! Cutting down on features and deviating from the original formula, so it could be played on consoles! Damn them all to oblivion!

FAF is full of morons, noobs, casuals, and cringey sweaty boys. BUT, it is hella fun. Even just to watch. 
Sup Com FA is one of those games that you boot up first time and BANG, the AI just blasts you into the dirt and demands you to learn. You do, and you start some giant brawls. Very rewarding. FAF is a MUST for multiplayer, coop is available there, along with MP matches that are still being balanced and tweaked. Ranking is there too, so people will see your rank and complain that you are too ""good"" or you are so ""bad"" or that they lost their blanket and they don't have the spine to play a PVP game... but all told, there are a lot of good players there and some of them even have decent personalities. If you like RTS in a futuristic setting, don't hesitate to pick this one up. Download FAF and roll coop with friends in campaign or custom fights against AI until you are ready to learn what a build is, and how to play your position.

Edit: April, 2020.

Now that i have played the game for a longer period of time i can fully  backup my first review.

ùêíùê§ùê¢ùê´ùê¶ùê¢ùê¨ùê°:
Extremely fun to hop into and flash forward an hour in what feels like 5 minutes, whilst looking at the screen of defeated commanders of a barren battlefield of destroyed tanks and aircraft. 

ùêÇùêöùê¶ùê©ùêöùê¢ùê†ùêß:
Good replayability, the voice acting is mediocre but unnoticeable and the characters, although reasonably unmemorable reinforce the story to a good extent.

ùêÜùê´ùêöùê©ùê°ùê¢ùêúùê¨:
Ageing fast but are still alright to view, especially if you have a low end PC or laptop, I'm sure the game will run optimally possibly even on the highest graphics setting.

ùêåùêÆùê•ùê≠ùê¢ùê©ùê•ùêöùê≤ùêûùê´:
Although more popular than the previous instalment of the series, matches will be hard to come by if you live rurally or in a place without a good internet connection. Furthermore games tend to last an hour or two and usually might fall into a stalemate. nonetheless is still worth trying to play if you are competitive or have a strong internet connection.

ùêÇùê®ùêßùêúùê•ùêÆùê¨ùê¢ùê®ùêß:
Overall it is a strategy game not for the most casual of players, due to matches heavy investment of time, however is still a really fun and, personally, a game that is ageless thanks to its easy game-play and repetitively hooking atmosphere and engrossing and complex mechanics.

The games economy is a finely balanced work of art, simple and fun to balance production against income of two resources, mass and energy. Multiplayer is where the game shines, 1v1 being the epitome of the experience.

And it also has a very active modding community to keep the game alive.

If you are a fan of RTS games, you won't regret buying the Supreme Commander. Especially the Forged Alliance.

This is my ALL TIME GOLDEN STANDARD of what an RTS should be. Huge verity of units and play styles, XS sized maps too XXL.

We were both the type of player that would turtle up, and build a super defense line with deadly artillery laying waste to our enemies. 

I will say, and I don't know why this is, but the game does tend to get lower frame rates at about the 15 to 30 minute mark of the game.

The scaling and skill ceiling is immense. Great game for both hardcore and casual players.

They cheat, and sometimes ALOT. Shit dosent seems so ""slack"" anymore. Half the planet is coverd in craters, robotic skeletons and nuclear waste. Desperately you focus on your shields while under constant bombardment, power outages keeps you from supporting and holding the frontlines. You can no longer afford to rebuild, holding off in a last stand. Your scanners detect nuclear missiles as frequent as the last few seconds of a popcorn bag in the microwave.

To build a building that costs 500 mass and 2000 energy, a builder may be able to channel 10 mass and 40 energy into the building. If the building is destroyed, you only loose the resources that had already been channeled into it.

Unit command is via an intuitive interface, and allows you to issue quite complex command sequences. There's an AI that will handle micromanaging unit formation for you - if you choose to use formations. This is actually recommended, since if you mix mobile shield generators into a land army you'll want them evenly distributed. You can still issue commands to move and attack, or do a move+attack.

There are 3 types of mobile units: land, air, and sea. You can set up factories for each and give them build queues to ensure you never run out of units at the front lines. There are also several types of building that can be used both offensively and defensively. These include cruise missile launchers and defenses, point defense turrets, AA turrets, shield generators, both short- and long-range artillery, and nukes and nuke defenses.

There are 4 unique factions in the game, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are some buildings and units that all 4 factions have, but they may operate in different ways. The UEF point defense turret is a frequent firing projectile that does low damage; the Cybran turret is a LOS lazer; and the Aeon turret is slow-firing/high-damage. The Cybran are the only ones with a mobile stealth field generator, etc.

The most spectacular combat takes place via truly unique ""experimental"" units, 3 or 4 to each faction. These are either powerful mobile units with unique abilities, or buildings that grant impressive abilities. Building them takes a lot of resources, but by the mid game you can be taking in enough to make it worthwhile.

Overall, the combat is very balanced and has lots of room for individual playstyles and clever strategies. I like this a lot better than Starcraft.",1581751182,1581751182,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can lose yourself for an entire afternoon playing one mission, especially if you are trying some unusual new approach.

Let me tell you what i saw and feel.

This game is made 12 years ago and yet its graphic is good enough to compete with the best RTS games today.

The strategic value it has to offer differentiated True RTS from RTT (which includes many big names Starcraft, Warcraft, Warhammer 40k...)

And just as a true RTS game would be, it is complex. Random events though rarely occur (0.001%) can sometimes change the course of a match. For example, a Transport ship can collide with a flying Tactical Missile and if your Command unit is on-board, it's checkmate. Or the expensive nuke warhead accidentally hit 1 Air Superior Fighter (this is very rare because the speed of both the missile and the Fighter are fast, not to mention they fly at different altitude and the Nuke only ever drop its height when it is right above the target). Everything on the board come to play thanks to its realistic physics laws.

Each factions though has similar units type, they can either perform slightly better, has additional mechanic or has different statistics combination (Shot 2 high damage rockets vs shot 4 low damage rockets vs shot 3 medium damage rockets). Understanding these fundamental elements can help you shape a better strategy or tactics against your opponent.

GPG closed down in 2017 but the game itself outlived its studios. Even today it has a dedicated fanbase, a dedicated development team, a dedicated server for players to play around the globe, a dedicated mod community that creating more content as we speak.

Why is this good game not as successful as other series?

Number 1: this is for hardcore RTS fans. Thus, the general RTS community either find this too hard or not their cup-of-tea.
Number 2: and there are many definition for success. One of the most successful RTS game which is Starcraft 2 has these characteristics. A short game match (30-45 mins, rarely go over 1 hour) and much easier learning curve. SupCom game can goes into 2-hours mark in average and 4-hours games are not that rare which is ill-suited for Tournament e-sport program. Its learning curve is also quite high. You need to commit to learn if you ever want to go above Average Joe. Even with 1000 hours of gaming but without commitment to learn you will just be any amateur out there (including me).

If this game is not your type, you can move on but i will recommend this game because its quality is at least candidate-for-GOTY and there are not enough good recent RTS out there to recommend them instead.

After that, seek multiplayer to improve; ask other players for advice. Most are nice enough to help you (though there are some who are not so nice, too).

However, some of its mechanics aren't included or explained in the tutorial(since this was made for fans of the first game), so buy supreme commander too for a better experience.

That, and the fact that some buildings also count as units.

You should be able to play it on any modern PC or laptop(which I actually play on) with good enough fps.

Pros:

+ Unit chain-pathing from a source building to create patrols.  Good players might not use this as much, but crappy players like me will no doubt LOVE the visual affect of watching the patrols running.

+ 3 levels of technology for all units in a logarithmic expense.  I.e. it will take forever to get to the next tech if you try to jump too early, so the time building up creates a layering of the playing field.

+ The single-player campaign is nice.  If you are interested in this, get the package that has FA and the original game to get the whole campaign.

+ The campaign is the only place you'll hear voice acting.  All the sounds in a skirmish are just robotic machine noises and they are all nice to listen to.  The play field becomes this noisy droning clattering thing.

+ This was the first game to have the feature ""zoom in wherever my mouse is pointing"".

+ Templates are cool!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1820897815
First of all, I didn't play it in 2007-2011. I have just installed it in a middle of 2019. The graphics is extremely outdated. So, my first expressions were negative. I have started a campaign. I watched intro cinematics, it reminds me a cheap sci-fi movies of 80s. Finally, I have started the game.

The game explains nothing, just give tasks. OK, I realized how to build a base, made random units ( i had access to 40 units in the first mission, wow, really). Made a huge army, sent them to the attack. They died. OK, I made a bigger army, destroyed a couple of defenses. I repeated this for several times and completed a task. I got new task. Go to another point and destroy units there. So, I have just made bigger army....

I don't know... It is not great. It plays as Make a Big army simulator. I suppose there is a deep gameplay at later stages, but the game doesn't engage enough to continue playing.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1820897922
Pros
- Other people say it is the game with very deep mechanics
- Still alive. You can play multiplayer

Cons
- It looks bad
- Units even of one nation look the same
- Campaign story is below average
- Economic part of the game is primitive

Came out at a time when I didn't have a gaming PC, and I followed it for years before picking it up this spring. What an effing pick-up for $4 on steam sale!

The streaming economy is easy to understand and hard to master, with a massively high skill ceiling. The unit and faction variety hasn't been matched in any RTS since. 4 Distinct races, each with 4 tiers of units to combine into massive armies of death robots.

And the scale is just breathtaking - regularly managing engagements of up to hundreds of units spread across 20 x 20 or even 40 x 40 Kms of real estate (there are even some 80 x 80 km maps, but at that point it is getting ridiculous). The variety of strategies and tactics that you can pull off is endless... 

Upgrade your commanders weapons and armor and then teleport him into your enemy's bases to snipe their commander? Build game-ending super weapons launching nuclear missiles or nuke-tipped artillery entirely across the map? Build giant death robots, submersible super-carriers or land-dreadnaughts? Or just spam an overwhelming army, navy or airforce to overcome your opponent through sheer brute force of numbers?

This game literally has it all. A must have for any strategy gamer.

Campaign is very interesting and teaches you the basics, but you really need to watch some videos of high level play to really see this game shine. Check out Gyle's FAFcasts on youtube for an idea of what this game is capable of. 

Some of the shit high level players pull off is other-wordly... sneaking a nuke just around the back of the opponent's strategic missile defense via a nuclear submarine parked in the corner of the map... Apocalyptic experimental artillery battles... Strategic bomber barrages... Endless hours of entertainment!

If you love strategy games of any kind, you owe it to yourself to try this one. Right up with Sins of a Solar Empire for my fav all time strategy games!",1564456690,1564456690,True,42,0,0.784167468547821045,0,True,False,False

WHILE I HAVE THE DEEPEST RESPECT FOR THIS GAME, AS WELL AS THE GENRE AS A WHOLE, I MUST STATE I PERSONALLY DISAGREE WITH THE GENERAL DIRECTION THIS PARTICULAR STRATEGY GAME FOLLOWS.

GREAT TACTICAL SYSTEM. ALLOWING DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF FORCES, AND A WIDE ARRAY OF STRUCTURES TO COMPLIMENT A VARIETY OF PLAYSTYLES. THREE FACTIONS THAT LOOK AND FEEL DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.

AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, THERE ARE MANY STRUCTURES TO LEARN HOW THEY WORK, IT CAN FEEL OVERWHELMING. THERE A MANY TIERS OF UNITS AND STRUCTURES, WHEN THERE REALLY NEEDN'T BE. THREE TIERS IS OPTIMAL, FOUR IS TOO MUCH. CONTROLS ARE NOT AT ALL INTUITIVE AND [i]CANNOT[/i] BE CHANGED.

The real value of this game is of course multiplayer which has an amazing community in the Forged Alliance Forever. You will never want for multiplayer lobbies with equal representations for noobs and pros in the ratings.

However, this game will require you to surmount one very tedious aspect. The early game!

The early game has to be approached as a master chess player would approach the opening moves in a chess game. There are many options, but they are all set in stone and you have to execute them to the letter unless you want to provide your opponent a compounding competitive advantage in the mid and late game. Learn the early build orders, the timings, and the options available depending on faction/map. Everything after this part is pure creativity, inspiration, and cunning.

It's incredibly fun even if you are trying to learn the game as well as creating your own strategy and then trying it out to see how it does.

There are many different types of AI difficulty which gives it more of a challenge, the online experience I only play LAN with my friends and we side in one team against AI as well as picking different factions from each other. 

The modding community is awesome on this as well, you get some mods that can change the game completely or you just get some more maps and they are just awesome as well as the default maps.

You get to deal with such an epic match that can last 40 minutes to 2 hours tops and it is so AMAZING!

It is worth the price, worth the time and most of all, get a group together, get some sort of LAN program like Hamachi or something and your set!

Every faction is only slightly different from one another, but the differences add up and make picking a favorite pretty hard, it's wild that 4 nearly identical factions all play differently.
Here's an example, the advantage to the Cybran faction is slightly reduced build costs, slightly reduced build time and larger area of effect for shield generators for the most obvious differences, then small additions like them having the best rapidfire artillery and the only boats that can go on land, an experimental unit whose purpose is to be disposable at the cost of garbage unit accuracy across the board makes playing them feel completely different from the other armies even if you basically do nearly the same thing with nearly the same types of units and buildings. it's the small abilities on the units that make em stand out. (like grabbing missiles in the air and throwing them back)

Also the games can last HOURS, without mods there's up to 8k units and buildings in a match and individual experimental units that can take up to over an hour to build which can be sped up by having multiple builders but increases resource drain. 

Which leads into the resource economy and would just loop into like a chain of other things in the game that all compliment each other very well and make the absolute best RTS I've ever played.

Also there's still a competitive community for this with a light modding community that shares maps and stuff, just look up FAF: Forged Alliance Forever and then buy this if you like the idea of a strategy game being won with a little bit of luck and a lot of planning and reading your opponent rather than micro managing every minute unit.

It is quite literally, the [i]perfect RTS[/i]. It effortlessly captures the massive scale of the war you're fighting by literally allowing up to 1500 units per player (in a high player-count game I've seen upwards of 18000 at once), and makes it so incredibly easy to manipulate your units, that you can bounce between the macro and micro scales as fast as you want, whenever you want. There's no bullshit 'morale' system, no bullshit 'squad' system, and no bullshit fullstop. It's pure, fast-thinking, and [i]perfect[/i]. On top of this game being fucking [i]brilliant[/i], it's one of the only two RTS games that aren't complete bollocks (the other being AoE:II) - reasons why below.

My main problem with other RTS games is unneccasery mechanics. Simply having more mechanics does not automatically make your game more meaningfully complex, and it just encourages a focus on micromanagement. Starcraft suffers from this terribly, and battles are determined by who can press the most buttons in the least amount of time. There's no [i] concious thought[/i] in that at all, and battles are never won on strategy - this [i]completely[/i] undermines the very idea of a 'real time [b]strategy[/b]' in the first place.

Further problems include the fact that if you have no resources in other games, you have to wait for your scout/miner/whateverthefuck to bring resources back to your base to build more units to back up your army, and if, say, you were in the middle of a battle, this is precious time lost, and it (once again) is down to whoever clicked first. SupCom's economy, however, is decided by more by map control (more map control gives more mass extractors, more mexes means more mass collected per tick) than who-clicked-on-a-pile-of-shit-first, and map control is decided by, you guessed it, whoever has the better tactics (or more units, but that must mean you've got a better economy, and as such have already demonstarted superior tactics).

None of this [i]even mentions[/i] the game's [i]nigh-flawless[/i] use of asymmetry within the factions. Each unit in the game has different capabilities based on the faction you're playing as, and each unit either has a strategy, or a unit that hard counters it. [i]It's a giant game of rock-paper-scissors, but it [b]actually benefits the game[/b][/i], because (unlike other asymmetrical games ([i]I'm looking at you, Overwatch...)[/i]) you can see exactly what's around the corner at any given time, and adjust your strategy accordingly. [i][b]This means the game is based purely on outsmarting your opponent.[/b][/i] No other RTS is like this. [b]That[/b] is exactly why Supreme Commander is a masterpeice.

The game is even still maintained by the community via FAF - Forged Alliance Forever - at faforever.com. Recently we got loading screen tips, because, why not, and it's updated frequently with various balance changes and the like. The community is great - I play with the GB clan - and they're the loveliest bunch of guys you're ever likely to meet (even though I haven't been active for a while).

Simply put, SupCom:FA is the closest game to pure real-time strategy ever made. There's no messing around. It's a fast-paced, rapid-fire, mental challenge, not a twitch game, and it is almost completely unique in that regard.

PROS
- fair economy system (2 resources, minerals are map dependant, energy is building dependent)
- extensive amount of units and buildings
- You can have a navy, even Halo Wars didn't give us that
- Good campaign that has 3 playthroughs (1 per faction)  that are the same missions but have different objectives and events based on the faction you choose

CONS
- most matches against AI last a few hours in my experience (I turtle but still it can be a slow game)
- some of the super / unique units to each faction are overpowered. 
The UEF have a unlimited range artillery (expensive and takes so long to build but if built, could easily win the match). 
The Aeon Flying Saucer, while it can be killed, can disintigrate half your forces and base before it goes down

Favourite thing is to play UEF, make a submersable-carrier fleet and watch all the fighters and gunships launch out while the battlecruisers and battleships bombard the enemy and then send in the massed dropship assault force, it looks cinematically beautiful.",1560118882,1560118882,True,15,1,0.60999906063079834,0,True,False,False

A realy good game. U have so many differnt ways to attack. 

The Game has the point on diffrent ranges. 

Like: A Bomber (Plane) can attack a normal ground bot, but the ground-bot cant. So u need defence 4 that.

Or: Aeon-Units have higher range than anothers on ther level, so u can hold distance and attack (difficult, but possible in an active figth)

So many way to win the game: Nukes, Rush (of course), Def and slow expand, Endgamer (Big-cannons... rly big).

The Winner is most of the time the guy with the best eco. Thats normal.

You can play smaller maps with for instant action where lower tier matters or bigger maps where battles tend to draw out a bit longer and you'll probably see tech 3 stuff, maybe even experimentals, most likely will if you play against bots, less so against humans.

The game is highly moddable, I mostly do comp-stomps so I play the steam version and just play compstomps.
However there's also FAF which is a highly supported mod with a big competitive community.

The campaign is also not too shabby, it's not easy for someone that would be new, as it expects you to know the game (probably cause it's an expansion even though it's stand-alone), but I still recommend a playthrough with all 3 factions.

For 10 euro it's a pretty good deal, if it's on sale it's a must-have if you like RTS games.

The only downside is that it isn't optimized for multi-threaded machines, so it doesn't matter if you have a I9 from 2018 or an I3 from 2014, you'll probably still get the same performance as a Core2Duo back in 2007.",1555106156,1555106156,True,7,0,0.605140268802642822,3,True,False,False

Definitely a step backward from the original. 
You start with full cap vice it opening along with the map.
You can make your experimental units on the first map, and there would be no reason to not do so as they count as only 1 each towards cap.
The campaign is all but identical for the three factions, and when playing more than one faction (last two maps) the conquest is trivial.

Also, if you feel that matchmaking lacks in populace, look up Forged Alliance Forever, it's a well-established community hub with the replay and mod vaults, hosting lobbies, buncha gamemodes, ladder, base and custom coop and a massive upgrade to the game itself with a ton of balance changes and a few integrated mods that just make the experience better and only [i]a bit[/i] different.
Edit! This used to be a spoiler since it sorta condoned piracy(because I care for the people that can't afford games), but they now require you to be linked to Steam with the game on it, used to just need a matching version with the steam release. So if you wanna faf about - go get it! It's rather cheap anyhow. I know, some still won't be able to afford it or would prefer to not give SE any money, but the openness of FAF got abused by smurfs to the point of driving the admins to use the most reliable, if not most welcome, method of stopping the criminal scum.

NOTE: when you buy Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance you MUST follow the links to download the community-driven client called, ""Forged Alliance Forever"" which allows for easy multiplayer and ladder battles.

SO, the mechanics of forged alliance are vastly better then Starcraft meaning that a person can be competitive even on a low APM. This makes supreme commander a strategy game, rather than a twitch game like Starcraft. Supreme commander allows the player to create templates for quickly building a group of structures and has an option to build units on repeat from a factory. Due to the excellent economy system it is possible to stack construction orders even before the resources are available. 

The maps are beautiful in forged alliance and consist of natural landscapes rather than a contrived typical starcraft map with a main base, natural and ramps connecting them. In forged alliance, zooming in and out with the mouse wheel allows for easy assessment of the battlefield and there are 4 playable races with deep strategic diversity and completely different aesthetics. Getting to know the races is endlessly enjoyable.

There are more diverse units in forged alliance  - for example,  fully fleshed out land, air and navy, radar and stealth opportunities, artillery, dedicated scout planes, submarines, torpedo bombers and awesome large experimental units, to name a few.

Your ACU, which represents you on the battlefield, is a useful and upgradable weapon but it must also be protected because if it dies you lose the game. This mechanic adds tension because a player who is losing in economy can still win by sniping the ACU if they are clever. When an ACU dies it also explodes like a nuke which adds interesting mechanics in team games.

I could go on for hours about why Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is great. It is criminally under-rated and I could never play starcraft again after playing this.",1551933324,1551933324,True,25,1,0.720299243927001953,0,True,False,False

The campaign is amazing, the scale of the battles are breath-taking, the strategies you can come up with are numerous and vary wildly every game, and don't even get me started on the tech and units. I used to play with toys and imagine epic battles, full of heavy shields, nukes, massive artillery, giant mechs, strategic bomber swarms, you name it. I never would've thought that something like that actually existed as a playable game. This game is my childhood dream come true!

Yes it's an old game, but there is still a very active community (with plenty of amazing mods that add even more content). Just search up Forged Alliance Forever. The balancing in the community is wonderful, though it varies quite a bit from the steam version. I highly recommend playing FAF though, it includes everything from this game and so much more. Because of this community I've played thousands of hours of this game, so the steam numbers lie a little bit (more like a lot). In my opinion the graphics aged very well, the game looks epic and if anything the graphics make the game scale into huge battles a lot easier. 

The sci-fi theme of the game is truly one of a kind, the story is interesting and the theme lets units be wilder than you could ever imagine. The mechanics are wonderful, the tech system is the best out of any game I've played. It has the perfect blend of air, naval, and land units. The best part is the scale and weight of experimental units, they're truly unique and can change the tide of battle all by themselves. The most interesting aspect of this game that I haven't seen before is the usefulness of your commander unit. The standard gamemode (that's pretty much [i]always[/i] played) has your commander as your lifeline, which leaves you needing to protect it while killing the enemy commanders. This leads you to believe you should always have it heavily protected, but this unit is also your strongest. It makes for an interesting balance in every game you play, because the usefulness of your commander can't be overlooked. A good player can kill an entire tech 1 army with just their commander, leaving his own army free to raid his enemy's base. The over-all balance of this game is best seen when playing on FAF (they did a really good job with this game and have been going strong for years now), but what keeps this game interesting and fun is the sheer amount of units and possible strategies to win. I don't want to spoil the fun, but I want to say that there are more ways to win than you'd expect from a glance at this game, and certainly more ways than I could hope to write in this review. Any meta for this game involves so much more than any other RTS game it's almost laughable. Of course expansion and land-ownership gives you the edge, but you can definitely still win if you know what you're doing, and that's something I enjoy most about this game. You never play the exact same game twice, even after thousands of them. The only disclaimer I'd like to make is that the games can last very long (usually at least an hour per game), especially if you don't have a good cpu in your computer. It all just depends on the size of the map though and the amount of units there are on the battlefield.

these extensions make you think more and play more. sometimes one mission can take 3 hours if you not rushing finish fast.

If you're into long range, serious fire power and routing of hundreds of units into combat at the same time, this is it.  The interface is so good, specifially because of the ability to scroll out and see a ""global"" view of the battlefield.  Before this feature, not many RTS had this as an option.  Most RTS keep the player view what feels like inches off the action.  What a frustrating way to play an RTS. Understanding the field is one of the most important parts of an RTS game and not being able to see what you are engaging is a great way to kill the commanders ability to command.  Supreme Commander does not suffer from this illness.  

There are a few (small few) titles since this game that have kept up with it's amazingness but if you havn't played THIS one yet, have the cash and time to blow, do it.  You wont be upset about it.  I can tell you the price tag underwhelms what is most certainly one of the best RTS out there.  The reason it's not expensive is because of it's age but it holds it's own against the test of time.

When everyone else keeps trying to take things down to a smaller and smaller scale where everything is just more and more micromanagement, this is a game that takes the scale in the exact opposite direction. Everything is on an epic level. Battles go down between thousands and thousands of units, and the war isn't won in clever little second to second moves but in being able to react, plan, and focus on a much larger level. This isn't about if your 8 guys and their 8 guys met up and you got good trades on the balance. This is about if you can react to multiple fronts and strategies and armies all at once and come up with something that will outdo what the other guy is doing. And then do it again when they change it up to react to you.

It's hard to explain it in a way that gives it proper credit, but it's something very different to all the other RTS's out there and it's well worth a look.",1543304638,1543304638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 My style of play is defensive and I like to take my time building up for one nasty sweep.. In this version you don't get the chance. You are already being bombarded by tech 2 units off the screen in 5 minutes... Very frustrating compared to the original game..

the scale of battles are amazing and the seamless zoom is the best.

You can turtle and build long-ranged artillery and nukes, or rush the enemy base with bomber planes and a huge army.

Before I talk about the game I prefer supreme commander 2 than Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, this wont change my point of view on the game and I will make points to Supreme Commander 2 within the review.

Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is more of a slow paced game compared to Supreme Commander 2. 
Forged Alliance, brings new fantastic units to the roster, with more options with the reclaimed mass, the maps are much larger with great terrain height. The unit movement is a bit poor tho, I found myself micro-managing a lot with the land and sea units. The land units would keep getting stuck on the side of the mountain which did not help in combat but was easily fixable and not too much of a worry. The unit navigation, in the end, was all right for a game that came out in 2007.

While the online scene is long dead and gone simply due to age, playing against the AI is still a great barrel of fun with some friends or alone. Sinking 2-3 hours a game isn't unheard of if you really want to go crazy on a 100+ square kilometer map.

However, the game's age does show - units often have poor path-finding and there's a lot of dodgy controls with regards to mass unit movement (such as them clustering, or lagging behind one another due to limits on the number of units being sent pathing orders at once) that can become frustrating. While this is never going to addressed by any kind of patch as the developers are long defunct, the issue is more commonly caused by pushing the boundaries of the game to territory it wasn't really intended to reach (such as a 3+ hour game with literally 8000 units moving about at once).

Don't get me wrong, there are good aspects. The unit variety is good, the graphics are superb, and once you get established the experimental units are a lot of fun.

However, the game is plagued by issues that only the most obsessive strategy nerds will overlook, which is one reason why this game has cult status but little widespread appeal.

The most obvious is the GUI. It's cluttered, gives little indication as to what the buttons actually do, and even the unit buttons are so tiny and difficult to identify that you'll often spend several seconds trying to find the one you want, which in this brutally unforgiving game is a death sentence (more on that later).

The units, while varied, are classified into ""tiers"" which basically means every unit in the first tier is copy-pasted into the next higher tier, given a higher cost and better stats, and a new visual design. So most of the game, instead of balancing units by their individual characteristics, revolves around knowing the exact microsecond at which to start upgrading to the next tier. And if you have poor timing and try to tier up too early or too late, you can usually expect the game to give you a fat middle finger in the form of having no hope of recovering and defeating your enemy.

Of course, I can't talk about the game's focus on ridiculously specific tier upgrade time frames without talking about the other ridiculous and equally crucial aspect that is resource management. You have two resources, which shouldn't be hard to manage but they've made sure it is by putting all your resource data in a tiny bar at the top of the screen from which you must divine exactly how much you can spend without power stalling. This plays into the UI problems, as both the resource bars and the costs of each unit are difficult to read and often leave you trying to figure out how much you can afford to spend, and usually making wildly incorrect guesses which the game will happily punish you for.

The units themselves often have subtle differences between tiers and factions that WOULD make them more interesting and useful, if the game gave you any indication whatsoever of what the units do and how they can be useful. The game's tutorial is short and pathetic, and will leave you struggling to figure out the cumbersome UI and completely clueless as to what units fit what roles. Unless you have a calculator handy and don't mind pausing every 10 seconds, you'll never know what ratio of damage/armor to unit cost you're running, and where most games organically and intuitively place units in their own distinct, easy-to-understand roles, the roles that this game's units fill are so disparate and awkwardly mashed together that you could write a dissertation on the strategic roles of each one. 

Again, this complexity might be great to hardcore strategy nerds, but I do mean HARDCORE because to anyone else it's going to be hours of miserable trial and error before you can begin to enjoy yourself. I've played about six hours now and still have little if any idea of what any particular unit does, what it's good for, what it's weak against, etc... outside of its basic role of ""does it shoot ground or air"" and ""is it long range or short range"".

The units' designs in and of themselves reflect this completely nonsensical mashing-together of capabilities with equally frustrating and unintuitive size comparisons. So you have this unit that towers over the battlefield, surely it's more than a match for this tiny little spider? Well guess again, because that tiny little spider is a sniper that will rip your giant walker apart before it gets in range. Units are usually viewed as tiny swarming ants on a vast battlefield, but there's no natural size-to-armor or size-to-firepower relationship, making it even more difficult to understand the game. Even the massive experimental units experience this, because while they're quite powerful, their volume-to-armor ratios are complete horse shit. How are you supposed to tell what units do what? By slowly reading the manual and trying to remember which of the sixteen nearly-identical tanks is the one you need?

All of this compounds with the fact that the game is terribly optimized, chugging even on modern machines, with units often taking several seconds to register their orders (if this is because the pathfinding is offloaded to another thread, then what's the excuse for my garbage framerate even at minimum settings?) 

Overall, even if I decide to buckle down and learn how to play this insane game (I do love strategy games, being a fan of Command and Conquer and to a significantly lesser extent Starcraft), I'm not sure I can ever recommend a game that so vigorously spites anyone who buys it with the apparently wild expectation that it make sense and have an actual learning curve, instead of this game's learning cliff.

You can play air, ground, navy, doesn't matter, it can work and this isn't a shitty RTS like Starcraft 2 where you see the same shit every single game. Marine Marauder anyone? Every match feels different in this game. Don't get me wrong, there are recurring strategies, like T1 spam, Monkeylord Rushes, things like that. But they are things that can be properly countered in many different ways. Not just ""If enemy builds X counter with Y""

For example a common strategy is T2 Bomber Rush Sniping. What this means is, there are 4 tiers of units. T1 are basic, T2 are mid tier, T3 are the endgame units, and T4 are experimental units, the big guys you might never see more than one of in a single match. A strategy is to rush to the point where you can build T2 bombers, get a handful of them, say like, 20, then rush them across the map to directly attack the enemy commander. If you do it fast enough, the enemy commander won't likely have enough T1 interceptors to stop them from killing their commander, or AA or anything like that. 

Thing is with this strategy, you can counter by... properly setting up AA to defend yourself. Keeping your commander under a shield. Having a good amount of air support and AA ground units roaming around. Or just... walk your commander into the water where the bombers can't hit them, and sure they will do damage to your base but it will let you get defenses up to kill them wher otherwise they might have killed your commander in a single pass. And scout your enemy to see if they are trying any cheesy strategies like this, as catching them out and countering it can cost them a lot of resources, allowing you to turn on them with a strategy of your own. 

Unfortunately the servers are shut down and the only way you can play real multiplayer is with Forged Alliance Forever (FAF), a third party client trying to keep the game alive. 

I say unfortunately, because not only is the community surrounding FAF EXTREMELY toxic with every match ending with people trash talking their teammates, calling them idiots... my god the number of times I've been told to kill myself for nothing more than not playing perfectly. But another issue is that I believe it's peer to peer, but regardless of the method, it's kinda crap. Unless all the stars align and you have the perfect internet, with the perfect provider and ISP, and the perfect location in the world... you can't play. Because it's very likely that every match you try to join will either be left with endlessly trying to load into the lobby, constantly trying to connect to people in the lobby who are infinitely stuck ""Connecting to-..."" on your end, or ultimately, getting into matches, lagging out the game because ""Sorry your internet and location combination don't match up perfectly"" and thus having the other people in the game all leave, and not allow you to join the next lobby as you'll just lag it out again. 

But hey, if you can get past the toxicity, and you end up having the right internet/location to play without lagging people out and getting blacklisted from everyone's lobbies, it's a really, really fun game.

Edit: Tried playing on FAF again recently. It's just as toxic as ever with extreme racism running rampant and the like.",1483246103,1535622996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The same errors like the newer SC2. The same missing content that made TA so great untill today. I find the interface perfect they improved alot and the economy of the game is nice aswell. A few more units to choose from and some nice playability. If you don¬¥t want to play old TA which is a 100% RTS and TOP 1 out there then this will be a worthy choice. Gameplay and fun is way better than SC2. Game may run a bit slow when having full map of AI and/or units with many ppl playing. The ability to slow/speed up game remained which I find nice. Overall a great pick and everyone who lieks RTS and did not play this should go for it.

You play the game for a challenge or play to simply relax and listen to a podcast (or whatever suits you best).

If you are debating between this and the original, get Forged Alliance, its more or less a really expansive dlc for the first game and was released as a standalone game instead of an addon to the first.

It is harder to play than Supreme Commander II, but when you master the mechanics of the game. Also the games last a lot longer than SC II. All factions are pretty similar if we ignore their look and their experimental units. They are extremely similar for the air units. All their units have a unique look and statistics, but most of them have an euqivalent unit in the other factions. With four factions :

United Earth Federation : tank builder and they use napalm for their bombs they rely a lot on bubble shields and damage,

Aeon : Religious zealots, they rely a lot on the use of personal shields, their damage is moderate and a lot of their land units hovers which makes them unvulnerable to torpedoes if they cross a river or a lake which represents a big advantage compared to the UEF's amphibious tech II units that floats which makes them vulnerable to topedoes and the batteries from nearby ennemy ships.

Cybrans : they are cyborgs that decided to live free from the UEF, they are pretty balanced but they have really powerful experimental units. Their amphibious unit goes underwater which makes them unvulnerable to nearby ships canon but vulnerable to torpedoes which is even more advantadeous to than the Aeon's hovers since these tanks can send torpedoes and subs are less commonly used as ships.

And there is the Seraphims : They rely on lots of HP and DPS. They are an alien specie that almost got exterminated in SC I, now they want to destroy humanity. By humanity they mean what humans created too. They attack the UEF, Cybrans and some Aeons (because some of them think they are gods).

Many other RTS games have a smaller focus that rewards tactics on the battlefield more than actual war-machine strategy. The scale of this game is massive, and the terrain plays a much more complex role in gameplay as a result. In many games, a hill or mountain serve the same purpose- that purpose being a simple obstacle that your units must navigate around. In this game, the geometry of the landscape will control what units and strategies will be effective based on the flight path of the missiles or artillery shells you choose to use against your opponent. This also is a result of the simulation-style of game engine the game features, which can result in interesting emergent behaviours or strategies that can turn a game around if a player imagines a creative way of using the physical laws of the game. The simulation can also result in bizarre rare occurrences that can make for fun, unpredictable and interesting events during play (such as an ICBM striking an overhead plane during liftoff).

If you are on the fence about buying this game because of a recent interest in RTS games, I recommend you just pull the trigger and do it. I have tried many of the recent/modern RTS games and none of them have captivated me nearly as long as this game. I would not recommend you even give Supreme Commander 2 a chance because it is a different game that follows a different philosophy, and it is a pity that it even shares a title with this game.

One final note: If you buy this game, downloading Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) is an absolute MUST. FAF is a 3rd party lobby that continually supports/patches/balances the game, features a pretty active community, and adds a lot of functionality to the game including multiplayer support for the campaign, a ranked ladder, and a built in map/mod sharing service.

Do you like RTS ?
Do you like long games ?

Go download Spring Engine and a set of games for it. It's free, and it's better.

More details:

Gas Powered Games is DEFUNCT.

USEFULL things to keep this game alive were to be downloaded there.
for example ... You cannot make mods anymore because the signature tool cannot be downloaded anymore. (You can still make mods, these mods have to be shadowing the game the hard way though.)

And my comment regarding spring as being superior is as follow: Spring's unit AI is actually BETTER at pathfinding ...

Spring has a better units formation implementation.

So for a game where you have to handle 500 units around a big map, go download Spring.
As a bonus, it's not on sale on STEAM, so you won't feed the Newell.

Your ACU starts to build your base, build military units for offence/defence, manage out your recources to a healthy balance (you have Mass as building recource and Power as upkeep recource) to the point where you build additional construction units which in turn start building their own forward bases. Your factories are supposed to be building on loop, meaning they will not stop producing units, to provide you with a constant flow of units to throw at your enemies.

This is probably one of the best things about the game but is also its downfall. The game is designed to limit your system to 2 cores of your CPU, meaning as soon as a lot of units are on the map the game will slow itself down in order to keep up even though your system can easily handle it. This results in all units moving in slow motion making it frustrating to play the game.

It's pretty stupid because the games charm is building giant armies and managing recources to build even more. The only way to counter this is playing on small maps and playing with a unit limit. That is the only issue there is with this game, and if this issue would to be resolved with a remastered version then it would be the best RTS on the market.

Even though this game is so old, it looks and plays really really good and deserves a remaster. To see your monkeylord (an experimental unit spiderbot that towers over the rest of the units) firing its huge ass laser over the battlefield really is a sight to behold.",1529657962,1529657962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All of this on a computer nobody would have dream to have when game was released.

First the balancing of the different types of units, because it feels like the air units (not all of them) stronger than most of the water- and land units. Second the engine of the game is pretty old, so that after you build up your base and started producing units, the game starts to slow down until it's so slow that it is boring to watch the units move one meter in an hour. After all, also with negative aspects, I had so much fun playing it and I hope that someday they update the engine and maybe fix the balancing.

I played a lot of the first game when I was younger when I had it on CD-ROM, and I loved it. Forged Alliance improves on it in almost every way. This game has an excellent campaign with well-designed and lengthy missions, which alone make the game worth getting.

There are some issues, of course, being an old game. One of the biggest my friend keeps complaining about is that the pathing can sometimes be buggy, but it's not game-breaking. Also, BE WARY of tabbing out of the game while in a match. Sometimes it'll just crash.

For years I dabbled in Age of Empires 2 and Starcraft, always wishing for and suggesting ideas that would improve the quality of the UI, always being shot down for some reason for another, only to find out that this game has all of that.

-Paying for units over time instead of up front? Check.
-Queueing lots of varied orders to a unit, and THEN being able to edit those orders on the field? Yup!
-Units and weapon projectiles that have something even resembling physics? Fucking finally.
-Play co-op story campaigns with your friends? Yes! But only with Forged Alliance Forever.
-Overly complicated research system that makes the game as obtuse as fucking possible by having two dozen buildings with different upgrades and serve no other purpose once they're finished and thus a skill floor that's somewhere in geostationary fucking orbit? Nope, wont find that here.

Imagine being able to zoom out to see that entire battlefield before zooming in to see all the tiny details on your units. Imagine massive robots steamrolling through a giant base at your command. You would be hard pressed to find these features anywhere other than in Supreme Commander.

Graphically, Supreme Commander is still one of the best looking strategy games on the market. It was even further ahead of its time than Burnout Paradise. You can zoom so far in that you can see individual lines and mechanical components on the robots. On the negative side, the explosions and missile trails could use a bit of work. Additionally, when you zoom out, it de-renders all of the units on the map, replacing them with their respective unit symbols. For the massive experimentals, however, the unit symbol does not cover the entirety of the unit no matter how far you zoom out. This means that some units seem to randomly dissappear for no apparent reason. Admittedly, I am nitpicking, but this does bug me just a bit.

Mechanically, this game is nearly a masterpiece. All projectiles are rendered as such. They have a ballistic arc, travel time, and can be dodged with skillful micromanaging. With long range weaponry, (particularly battleship cannons and artillery) no two shots will land in the same spot. Resource systems are persistent. Engineers don't spend all of the resources required to build a unit at once. Rather, they spend it at a fixed rate over time which detracts from your rate of income. If you are spending more mass and/or energy than you are earning, you will begin to deplete your reserves, which is where storage comes in. Storage units add capacity to their respective resource reserves and, when adjacent to their respective resource production structures, will give those structures a production boost of up to 50%.

The game flounders a bit with unit movement. Units tend to get stuck on each other. They simply do not flow together the way they do in Supreme Commander 2. This does lead to some interesting strategies, however. Units can be used to block others, particularly when trapping a commander or helping one to escape.

The most interesting part of this game is the fact that there is still a thriving multiplayer community. After GPGnet shut down, a modded multiplayer client named Forged Alliance Forever was created. This standalone client makes improvements to many of the slight imbalances that weren't important enough to list here. It also simplifies the mod installation process (much like the Nexus Mod Manager) and is a great way to add new maps to the game.

All of these features combine to make my favorite video game of all time. If you have fifteen dollars, this is definitely one to pick up.",1400036873,1522776139,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Obvious flaws in UI design (costruction bar doesn't know if to show the UEF Commander's missile construction progress or the structure construction progress he's at; lack of shield state info; no adjacency info for structures - neither affected nor provided), obvious flaws in population cap design (population-wise many low tier units can't counter few high tier units), no researches or upgrades that allow low tier units to stay relevant in the game later on, instead only structure upgrades and unit upgrades solely for the Commander and sub-commanders but they can't move while doing that - for whatever reason.

The solo campaign is awful: Always 2x map expansion + enemy attack waves spammed at you each mission. Shallow story, rarely any innovative mission design. In most missions the AI even fails to use (existing) nuke launchers against the player or the player's allies and even if the AI manages to use them it may fail at doing so correctly (irrelevant spot).

The UI lacks huge chunks of usability, ranging from proper engineer and engineering station control (don't nuke my economy into a deep minus; don't waste wreckage with excess gathering; it's not important that you reach the end of the waypoint(s) with attack-move but that you gather the resources along: wait if storage units are full opposed to driving from waypoint to waypoint) to show damaged unit repair cost in mass, energy, time with the selected amount of engineering units; show remaining time on missile construction of tactical missile / anti nuke silo missile / nuke silo missile along with total and remaining cost; show how much an engineer assisting a shield does increase it's recharge value and what's it's current recharge-assisted recharge speed like; what structures provide or benefit from adjacency bonus in which way; being able to restrict repair stations from certain tasks like structure construction / unit construction / missile construction / repairs / refuelling assistance or to make it auto-gather wreckages around while and in the amount it makes sense; no engeineering unit helps recharging shields by default if on assist or attack-move even if nothing else matters at the moment; no option to highlight any strategic icon in zoomed out map view to easily find relevant structures / units of the enemy; ...

Huge maps, pretty to look at units with a variety of weapon systems but obvious flaws, such as unit stupidity: a unit immediately dropping it's target order if ordered to move to dodge incoming fire, even if that target remains in range and an angle to be attacked continuously. Predefined unit target priority lists are sometimes absolute garbage and yet can't be changed, by the player, the ""Supreme Commander"", nor viewed. Thus I can't make use of a unit's turret as my choice is either to dodge enemy fire but have the unit attack the wrong target (like mobile tier 2 rocket launchers attacking mobile units opposed to structures, as they're siege units) or to take damage but be able to attack my intended target.

Bottom line: Focus on economy, far too much micro-management, unit stupidity that can't be fixed by the player because there are no UI options for that or it's not possible due to too many units doing stupid stuff (like tier 3 bombers flying off to suicide just because an enemy unit was around without the player having ordered that or stationary tier 3 artillery that, if left on it's own, starting to attack units instead of structures despite it existing to destroy those), lack of useful and important features (highlighting; engineering station restrictions; Sub Commander auto-upgrades), lack of things that make sense (low tier units not produceables in batches within high tier factories; tier 1 unit population cost equal to tier 3 or experimental population cost), pretty to look at but ranging from annoying to boring and in any case full of flaws.

Huge scale battles, intense resource management and strong tactical focus (your strategy really does matter, and and making the wrong choices at the wrong time can and will lead to disaster). The automation of factories and the way you give sequences of orders to groups of units works very well an allows for a reduction of micro management.

Multiplayer against human opponents is the best, but don‚Äôt expect it to be a relaxing experience - the game will demand your full attention and leave you feeling on-edge and under pressure.

The campaign is only 6 missions long, but the missions tend to be even more elaborate than in the original game, so there's still a decent amount of playtime involved. There are four factions, but unit types are mostly the same between factions - the factions don't feel distinct and unique like they do in other RTS titles.

Unfortunately, the campaign in SC:FA seems even more broken than in the original game. You can easily beat almost every campaign mission by turtling in your starting area and building one or two Heavy Artillery or Experimental Artillery fortifications. [b]The Heavy/Experimental Artillery will automatically target mission objectives, such as enemy structures and commanders, even when they are hidden by fog of war and should not be targetable[/b]. The Heavy Artillery will quickly destroy such targets and win the mission for you, without you even needing to muster your army. There is no defense against Heavy Artillery, and enemies in the campaign have no AI at all, only prescripted behaviors, so tactics like this are stupidly effective to the point that difficulty is nonexistent. 

Because the enemy has no real AI, campaign missions are balanced around cheap tricks. Every time you complete an objective, the map expands, and typically you immediately get hit with a massive surprise attack. This is unfair because there's no way to know where the next enemy base is, and therefore which direction the surprise attack will come from, until the map expands, but it's the only way the developers can add difficulty to the campaign.

Unit-level AI is dumb as bricks. Units try to shoot each other through terrain, don't react to incoming fire from enemies they can't see, and prioritize targets badly. Units with splash-damage attacks will damage friendly units, or destroy buildings you are trying to capture. 

The game includes none of the warnings and notifications that are standard in other RTSs. No ""Your units are under attack"", no ""You're low on energy"". The only time you're given any kind of cue is when your Commander unit is under attack. Lazy.

Key mappings are inexplicably completely different than Supreme Commander [b]and can't be remapped[/b]

As before, SC:FA contains many pointless tactical options that were a waste of time for the developers to implement. Strategic Submarines take so long to construct a nuke that they will never be able to launch one. The Paragon Resource Generator requires so much time and so many resources to build that if you can actually afford to build it, you don't need it. Although there are four levels of tech, the first two levels are largely superfluous since every match turns into a race to build experimental (boss-type) units.

Had it before steam, and must have well over 2000 hours played by now. I'm far from the best player out there.

This game will test your skills continuously. I've played RTS games since the very first C&C game, and if I have to compare it to anything... It's Command & Conquer: Zero hour. With WAY bigger maps. And WAY more units. And WAY better balance between factions.

No matter what faction you play, if you play to its strengths you can overcome its weaknesses. There is no ""best"" race, there is no ""best"" unit. There are game-enders, yes, but building them means you will already have a vastly superior economy. Trying to build one too early will result in your army failing in other areas, which will lead to your death.

Every game you play is a non-stop series of choices: Will I focus on air-to-ground? His air-to-air might overwhelm mine which means his air-to-ground has free reign. Will I focus on land units? They're no good if his navy is superior and bombards my army to gravel before it reaches him. Will I focus on an experimental? I better have a decent army in all other areas or he'll pound me before I can finish it.

Forget Total War, forget all of these games coming out trying to capture what this game had (I'm looking at you Planetary annihilation), because none of them are it's equal.

Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, is much like it's predecessor, Supreme Commander, except it is, in every way possible, an improvement. A better UI, a better selection of units, new factions, et cetera. If you were considering buying Supreme Commander over this one, I can only recommend doing so if you are interested in what happens in the story (although considering the endings were basically retconned, and one can only assume who won in this, this is not really necessary).

So, it's an improvement on the original? So what? What makes the game good to begin with?

Well, Supreme Commander has some interesting gameplay elements to it. First, there is unlimited resources. And I'm not talking Age of Empires trading caravans meaning you can theoretically have infinite resources by buying things at the market. No, the two resources in this game, Mass and Energy, are entirely unlimited. You will never run out, provided you have the means of production. But this comes at a cost. If you want to have any resources on reserve, you have to store them, and that is difficult to do on a large scale. You can't just have 1000000 mass, unless you build a whole lot of mass storage buildings. But fortunately, you don't need it. Resources in Supreme Commander are not spent all at once. They are spent over time. Rather than you building an engineer and having it cost 50 mass and take 10 seconds, you will build an engineer and it will cost 5 mass per second for 10 seconds. It equals the same, but this allows for one thing other games do not. If you have 50 units being built at once, but you don't have enough resources to build them, that's ok. Their building will slow down to match what resources you do have, instead of never happening in the first place. But the opposite is also possible. You can be building no units, but have hundreds of mass coming in. If you don't have the storage, that mass will absolutely be wasted. Gone for ever. This adds a balancing act into the game where you try to get enough engineers (which can also boost the speeds/resource cost per second of factories, by the way) and factories to match your resource production, without having too much that things grind to a halt.

So how do you get resources? Well, the resources in this game, Mass and Energy are both gained in unique ways. Mass is the more valuable one (usually), it's generally the thing that is hardest to get. In order to get mass, what you have to do is build mass extractors, which can only be built on certain spots on the map. There are a limited number of these, and controlling them is the most important thing in the game. The second way to get it, is to build mass fabricators. These turn energy into mass at an unfavorable, but uncapped rate. You can have as many as you want, so theoretically you can have as much mass as you want, so long as you can get enough energy to cover it. And the third and final way to get mass is simple; your primary commander unit, which is the first unit you have (the most valuable as losing it means defeat in the primary gamemode) an your secondary support commanders (which are expensive, but you can have as many as you want) produce a small amount of it innately, which can be increased with certain factions with upgrades.
Energy is the easier thing to produce. There are three ways of producing it as well. Your Commander units, certain tiles on the map called Hydrocarbon, and the third, and most basic and easy, building energy generators. These can be built anywhere, and you can therefore have as many as you want (although, if they are destroyed they do explode.. so maybe dont build them too close to one another).

Alright, cool, you can get resources, but what can you spend it on? A lot of things, actually. Supreme Commander boasts a large assortment of buildings and units that are spread over three technology tiers. You advance through these tiers by upgrading them, an expensive and slow process, but one that is very rewarding, as the power of tiers increases exponentially (each tier is about 3 times more powerful than the last). You can upgrade factories, Commander units, Mass extractors and Shield generators through the tiers independently. The rest of the buildings and units cannot be upgraded directly, although can be replaced by higher tier units and buildings through factories and engineers (which are made out of higher tier factories) of the respective level (or any levels lower than them). Not every unit has a direct upgrade, at least not in every faction. For example, most factions (except for Cybran, who have stealth instead) have a Tech 2 Mobile Shield Generator unit. But no factions have a tech three mobile shield generator unit except for the Seraphim. This means that, even if you have the third tech level unlocked, there is still use in the older techs; nothing is useless, even tech ones if you use them right. Of course, the factions that have access to the stronger variants are typically stronger in their respective fields. This gives every single faction a unique playstyle, and different strengths and weaknesses they can play for.

But, there is no talk of units without mentioning the most important units in the games, the ones that make Supreme Commander supreme commander; the experimentals. These are available at tech 3, but are unlike any unit in those trees. They are not built out of factories, but by tech three engineers, upgraded ACUS, or SACUS on the ground. These are unbridled power houses, and by far the most powerful units in the game, but also the most expensive. Each experimental is capable of serious damage, whether it be from raw firepower, like the high powered laser of the Monkeylord or the quantum disrupting bombs of the Ahwassa experimental bomber, or tactical power like the Paragon's infinite resources or the Czar's air unit construction speed. But none are the best. Every unit has it's counters, whether they be physical, like the galactic colossus being weak to air units, or more economic, like the Mavor costing more than anyone can afford without the game having gone on for far too long. These are the units that make this game epic; when you see a gigantic towering monster ripping apart armies of weaker units, or completely shattering the front line defenses, nothing is more exhilerating. 

Nearly everything in this game is balanced, and the things that aren't are most certainly fixed by the community. That's right, this game is both amazing, and still has an alive community of players and modders after ten years. A simple search for forged alliance forever finds you hundreds of people to play with, tons of mods that add new maps, buildings, units, ui changes, and balance updates on a well designed platform.

The ability to use two monitors to manage your forces in an RTS is still a first and only that I know of. The projectiles all exist in real space and interact with units, IE if your unit walks in front of a shot it will take the damage. Even with its age it is one of my all time favorites and as such bought a new copy on steam when it became available. Great for a LAN party(make sure you have at least an hour to dedicate to the game) or just to kill some time with single player.

The FAF community is a bunch of derps, but also are the most kindhearted community of derps to ever exist.

SupCom and its update Forged Alliance are not a game for those uncreative and annoying types that populate some RTS communities. You will need a better macromanagement and creativity to use the vast arsenal at your disposal. Seriously, there are more than 90 units and structures per faction (so you know, these are four) and most of them remain viable the entire game, even if just for niche strategies and counters. It's not as those crappy RTS nowadays where you have 3 viable strategies and they include just the ""loaf"", ""the burger"" and the ""cheese"" varying in amount according to situations, rarely including some sort of sauce for strategist wanna-be wimpy types.

No, my boy. You gotta play SupCom. The most dynamic economy in RTS (surpassing C&C), the most tricky hoverbombings, TRUE Battleships with up to 4 sets of armament, the LAZORS and even humbly called strategic missiles, which, truly to their glory, make most nukes in other games run for their money.

Never before did a game show this much dakka on a screen. It takes strategy, transforms it into an art form, and finally obliterates it with a whole armoured division of giant microwave lasers on spider legs.
The vast maps allow the players to think on a scale never seen before, and no game has replicated this accomplishment yet.
The units are gorgeous, and the experimentals are as awesome as they are ridiculous. All strategies have a place in the game, as long as the player has the wit to enact them. Between giant swarms of drones, artillery batteries bigger than most cities, groups of robots as tall as a skyscraper, and enough nuclear silos to erase your opponent off the map, this ten-year old game can still make us weep with joy.
All in all, it's the best strategy game of the decade.

It's very different and unique from other games and has it's own learning curve. Just because some units are higher tech does not make them better. Experiemental units don't win games and can be stopped with overwhelming force and numbers. Forged Alliance is oodles of fun, but has some issues.

The campaign is solid. Nothing all that different aside from characters yelling at you to help their worthless asses and different maps. I admittedly stopped after 4-5 missions. Do not care for campaign but it gets the job done. Skirmish and multiplayer are where this game shine. Oh, and if you don't like micro managing this might not be the game for you. Don't worry about hotkeys and actions per minute, but if you want your forces to fight intelligently and without too much human intervention then this might not be a fun game. The same goes for setting up a base. You need to layer air and ground defences properly, spread them in such a way that no side is weaker than the other or is supported by troops, blah, blah, blah. Lots of micro and strategy. Anyway.

Games start with your ACU (armored command unit) spawning in alone, and you have to build up from that. Depending on any in-game mods (it comes with a few) the game progresses quickly or slowly. You have to balance resource expenditure with resource gain, expand in a way that does not spread you out too much, and keep an eye out for enemy attacks from land, air, and sea. Early game is tense and nerve-wracking, depending on how quickly and efficiently you can amass a fighting force and defend your home base or ACU. Mid and end game are either quick steamrolls, (either you or the AI get smashed by others) or an hour or more war of attrition. Generally AI in this game is ok, but misses as much as it hits. They'll leave hundreds of land units stuck on an island, or drive them up and down the map without attacking a base.
However, I cannot express to you the terror of seeing a hundred+ enemy bombers flying towards your base. Same with experimental weapons. They can be countered, but god help you if they catch you off guard and unprepared. There are also nukes in this game. They're able to be defended aginst with missile defence silos, and  don't wipe out entire sections of the map, but they do enough damage that, should they land, it is very difficult to recover and can end your game.

There are plenty of units in each faction to construct unique and versatile fighting forces, and different tiers have different types of units. Tier 1 generally has the mass-produced and numbers over quality units. Tier 2 is the best of both worlds, decent fighting strength and affordability. Tier 3 is specialized and extremely expensive. The unit is good at one thing and nothing else. Tier 3 Interceptors command the skies but have nothing to attack the ground. Tier 3 bombers annihilate ground targets with MOABs and blinding speed but fall easily to well-placed Tier 3 and 2 AA defences as well as some patrolling Tier 3 Interceptors. 

One major problem I have with this game though is that, the larger the battle, the slower the in-game time goes. In an 8v8 battle with AI it got to a point where the passage of a single in-game second took five real-world seconds. And it wasn't because my computer couldn't handle it, but the game itself slowed down because it assumed I needed it since I was micro managing hundreds of units. At first this is a cool aspect, so you don't fall behind AI who can react instantly and manage thousands of units and productions at once, but it is unadjustable. Therefore once I've created the perfect base which supports and defends itself perfectly and I can just focus on fighting the game gets boring fast. It is the most frustrating thing to watch Tier 3 planes (the fastest units in the game) crawl across the screen like a snail. But if you have the patience for that, which I usually do but only for one to two hours, then this'll hardly be a detriment. To be frank though I'd rather have the slow-down than not, it has admittedly saved me from missing an experimental unit steaking through my lines more than once.

I could go on and on about this game, but in the end it's only $15 and if you like RTS games and have a few hours to dedicate to figuring out a whole new way of war, give this game a chance. It is not THE best strategy game (there isn't one) but it is certainly one of the best. It stands out from all others with it's scale, depth, strategy, and attention to detail. Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is definately one of the benchmarks in strategy games and well worth a measly $15.",1507658207,1508161463,True,12,0,0.631612062454223633,1,True,False,False

The economy in this game is one of the best in the genre, one which SupCom2 fails to uphold. The continuous economy system is great in practice and intelligent in design. Instead of a staggered income like in Starcraft where your resources are tied to workers physically traveling back and forth with an infinite storage, you have resources being aquired per game tick and finte storage. This facilitates building as much as possible when possible.

What is especially unique about SupCom1 is that when spending resources (mass and energy, the only two resources other than time) you don't pay the entire cost the moment you click build. Like the income, your spending is also on a per tick system. This is not only intuitive, it bypasses a lot of the tedium of macroing in other rts games. Instead of being charged upfront for queing 10 units, paying the entire cost of each unit before a single unit rolls out, you que units as you please and get charged the build cost per tick (something like every 1 or 2 seconds, i dunno).

You may think this is inconsequential, but when combined with spare resources in storage, you can build expensive structures or units extremely quickly for as long as you have the resources for it. In that same thought, if you have insufficent storage, you can use your engineers (all purpose builders, repairers, recyclers) to reclaim mass from destroyed  friendly and enemy units. After a large battle near your base, it's entirely possible to greatly increase your production per tick if you have engineers get the mass, allowing you to build some costly things for a short time.

The scale for this game is amazing. Unlike in other games where the camera is only ever at a fixed distance, requiring you to pan, click on the minimap, and use hotkeys to snap to places constantly, you can simply zoom out to see the entire map in SupCom. This gives you a better picture of your own army and buildings. Depending on your units' line of sight and sensors or dedicated radar/sonar structures, it's possible to locate every enemy unit and building on the map (barring some gameplay features). 

There are several core ideas to fight the enemy SC in the game. All of which involve building a main army, probably consisting of many tier 1 units and a smattering of Tier 2 and Tier 3 units when possible. T1 units are the most cost-effective, after all. 

One way to fight the enemy SC is to deny their mass income by destroying Mass Extractors as often as possible. Build a few units and send them out to deny as much mass as possible. This should slow down their production and development slightly. Of course, if they are also destorying your MEs as well, it gets more complicated.

Another idea is to use air transport units to attack structures that are important to the enemy. If your scouts see an undefended Shield Generator, for example, it might be worth dropping some T1 units into it to both deny the enemy SC protection and waste their resources and time by forcing them to rebuild it. It may also be a good idea to prevent large strategic buildings and Experimental units from being completed in the first place. No one wants a constant rain of artillery in their base or a giant death robot massacring their army.

The concepts in this game are inspiring and the execution of it is just so fun. It's clever and avoids some pitfalls or annoyances of other games of a similar genre. I suggest you at least try SC:FA.",1504031578,1507582007,True,11,0,0.634087741374969482,0,True,False,False

Lets start with the premise for this game. If you ever played an RTS and felt like it was a bit small, Supreme Commander is the answer to your unasked question.

The game plays out on absolutely giant maps, with distances that take average units ages to walk across, requiring you to build transports to move them at an even slightly acceptable speed. It allows for actual artillery to be laid down and strike your enemies from afar, sending a hailstorm of screeching shells into your enemy's frontline or even their home base. It allows for nuclear strikes that can wipe out entire fields of units if you're not prepared for it. There is so much feeling packed into Supreme Commander of being an almighty God that you cannot help but go a bit mad playing the game.

That's not to say Supreme Commander isn't balanced; quite the contrary. There are four factions, each with definite strengths and weaknesses, none of them so great that they cannot fight the others, but require different tactics and approaches. You can play the UEF, the remnants of a federation of humanity, trying desperately to restore order in a galaxy of chaos, brought about largely by themselves. Signing on with them nets you a straightforward fight, with classic artillery, tanks and choppers. Or you can play as the guerilla cybernetic freedom fighters, the Cybran, who seek to bring justice to all those melded with machinery from the tyranny of UEF. The Cybran are decidely more versatile, often equipped with cloaking devices, EMP strikes and amphibious vehicles, which give them an easier time doing many different things, as the situations change, but not quite the same headstrong charge of the UEF. If you play the long game, you can take your chances with the Aeon, an almost religious group, using long-dead alien technology to bring their fanaticism to the rest of the galaxy. Your units tend to be more maneuverable, hit harder and have slightly longer range, but with slow firing rates and a general inflexibility; each unit does one job only. As the story mode unfolds, you can play with any faction, advancing their campaign to an eventual endgame to decide the fate of the galaxy, whether it be in the hands of a shattered UEF, the fledgling Cybran or the mysterious Aeon.

In Forged Alliance, a whole new faction is brought to bear; the Seraphim. An alien race, believed extinct and vanished, returns in the aftermath of the first game, bringing with them a hellfire that fractures what's left of all three factions of the first game. Only by uniting together will they be able to defeat this threat. But the strain of these alliegences threatens their goal and the game opens with the entirity of the humanity on its last legs, trying to stem the tide of the Seraphim. Playing as the Seraphim offers a unique sensation. They combine many elements from each of the three factions, while remaining very distinct from the others, not merely in aesthetics, but also in their unit options.

And still, I need to speak more about playing the game itself. Every game begins with a Supreme Commander; a builder, elite soldier, gatherer of resources and military overlord all in one. These commanders represent your player and if they are eliminated, traditionally, you are too and the game is over for you. Even if you allow for the deaths of commanders without ending the game, it can often lead to it indirectly; the explosion left behind is massive.

There are two resources, energy and mass. Mass is only found in specific locations, while energy can be harvested from anywhere, but the buildings for doing so represent huge targets for your opponent and a loss of energy, even temporarily, can often knock out many of your elite units' special abilities, costing you more than you might realize. The struggle for more mass extractors promotes territorial conflicts as players scramble to collect as many as they can, build defenses and station soldiers there.

Once the resources pour in, you lay down a few factories, either to make air units, land units or sea units; each with distinct features and systems, but none of them isolated: land units are quite capable of downing aircraft, aircraft can bomb land and sea and a vessel close enough to the land will often obliterate nearly any land unit that gets too close. And when you've got enough units around you and a few engineers out from them, you upgrade your factories and start producing newer and often better units.

An interesting facet of Supreme Commander is that even late in the game, older units never become completely obsolete; they are always generated faster, cost less and often 50 tier 1 units can outmatch the equivalent cost of tier 3 units. In this way, keeping tier 1 factories around is rewarded, rather than punished and it promotes a genuine question as to when to upgrade, rather than just as soon as possible.

But when it comes time to end the game, Supreme Commander is a spectacular show of so-called ""Experimental Units"" which can only be built by engineers from tier 3 factories and often at absurdly high costs. But if you can afford it, you will not regret it; experimental units are designed to end games that would otherwise continue indefinitely and they are often highly succesful.

And that's not even getting into all the complex features of radar, cloaking, stealth systems, reclaiming, neutral camps, terrain, air fighters, submarines, tactical strikes, ground defenses, shields, mass generators, upgrades for your Commander, support commanders and so much more. In terms of features, Supreme Commander cannot possibly be said to disappoint. They never become overwhelming; so many of them simply make the game a joy to play. Queing actions has never been easier and more visual than in Supreme Commander, nor has transporting large swathes of units across the map or setting patrol routes.

Besides this, the game is highly innovative in its ideas, forgoing a minimap in favor of simply being able to zoom out so far that the main screen becomes a minimap, letting aerial units actually go off the map if required to by their maneuvors, aircraft carriers, submersible aircraft carriers. And if you were to zoom in, you will find that despite the game's age, it is quite a detailed and carefully crafted game, visually speaking (though it does tend to cost your performance some when too many units begin to gather onscreen, which, given the absurdly high limits for how many units can be on the field, is quite often possible). Not to mention a very good, if not always very memorable, soundtrack and sounds that instantly convey their meaning.

It's is very solid RTS, with many possibilities for victory. If only it was a bit lighter to run, especially on network play with lots of players and units.

With FA Forever, this game gets revived a bit after the demise of THQ and no one picking up where they left off with these games.

I firmly believe their is still a place for RTS games. 
Just not a whole lot of them at the same time and they have to be rock solid in the balancing department to even register with the hardcore fans.

2. The turtle AI really changes the way it behaves from map to map. Sometimes it really does sit back and build defenses and sends out some attacks, but other times it sends waves and waves of enemies. Also, I played against the Turtle Ai on several maps, and they never used a nuke. Then when playing on a new map, I got nuked within 20 min of game play...

If you've played the original Sup Com, play Forged Alliance on HARD

As a Sup Com veteran having completed all three campaigns on Hard a couple of years ago in my CD, I must say, Forged Alliance starts off with a bang, literally. 

I found Forged Alliance both harder and stupidly a hella lot easier compared to Sup Com in some missions. In the original, you start off with the basics, T1s and slowly progressing to T3s until you finally get to play with Experimentals. Forged Alliance starts you with everything (with an exception of 3-5 new toys per faction) available at your disposal in the very beginning. This makes sense given the context and situation of the events in the game. Yes, this means you can build Fatboys at the very first mission, and that's exactly what I did. You have more freedom in tackling with your mission objectives with the wider options you have. 

Starting my first play through as UEF on Hard, I found it relatively easy after getting used to the controls. I ended up turtling until I had a couple Fatboys and an godly number of Percivals, the UEF's new T3 Bot to pretty much cake walk the mission.
The second and the fourth missions I found the hardest in all six missions (yes, there are only six missions). Reason being, for the majority of the missions, you start with your ACU only, that's it. The enemy will be constantly harassing and sending waves after waves of units at you. Grabbing a foothold at the start of the missions IS the hardest part of the missions themselves. 

This is basically what I did for the entirety of my UEF playthrough on Hard. You can live off with only 2-3 Mass Extractors, create a defensive perimeter, tech up to T3 using only a single Factory and start spamming T3 Gens and Fabricators until you have enough to start massing Fatboys (15 is a good number, but there's no stopping you to go for more). From here, you can start tackling your first objective and pretty much steamroll the enemy until the mission ends. 

The problem I found in Sup Com in general compared to other RTS, say Starcraft is that you have all the time in the world to tech up and spam high tier units before proceeding to your FIRST main objective. It really breaks the illusion of urgency. Another problem I found in FA is it's short! Six missions shared between all 3 factions compared to Sup Com's 18, with six ""unique"" missions for each faction. However, with the introduction of the Seraphim means a 4th faction with a whole new box of toys to play with, but unfortunately, there is no campaign for the Seraphim.

Although Sup Com in general is a slower paced game with battles that could last for hours, the ability to change the game speed is an AMAZING addition. Because why wait for half an hour to create a nuke silo when you can speed the game up to +10 and wait for only like 30 seconds? Players with slower reaction times can perhaps play the game on lower game speed whereas players who find the game pretty slow can speed it up or you can do both to mix things up. 

All in all, I had a blast playing Forged Alliance and it was certainly a great addition to the game.  At $18 NZD, the price is a little too high IMHO. If you're gonna buy FA, buy the Sup Com Gold Edition instead, or better yet, buy it when it's on sale

Just a heads up, this is my first review so I apologize in advance for any suckyness. Also I have played much more off of steam. Also this goes for both games.





       The best game ""ever"" is a very hotly disputed subject. Most people say it's WOW, or Halo, or CS go, or COD, or Shadow of the Collosus, or some other game with a big fandom. All things considered, I say this one, because I truly believe it has (almost) every aspect of the ideal, at least strategy, game.



Great Interface 
                           
Immersive storyline                     

Balanced units                             

Unique factions                           
 
Many viable strategy options

Great replayability                       

Amazing Graphics

excellent Multiplayer and LAN gameplay

HUGE unit cap

tons of units to chose from

Truly epic maps

lotsa mods

Stunning (and realistic) scale (the smallest units are twice as tall as a truck and the biggest are about 1000 times larger)

              

If you havn't lost interest thus far I would love to go into details.



There are only two resources in the game, mass and energy, both ar equally important and are used to build everything in the game. mass is gathered primarily from ""mass deposits"" on which you build ""mass extractors"". Energy is gathered by building generators. Both are used in about equal amounts if you go by values as opposed to numbers. One of the most interesting parts of Supreme Commander is that its resource system is ""active"". In other words, you don't save up to buy something, then have it instantly reducted from your total when you buy something. Instead, the resources are gradually  pumped into a unit as you produce it. In short, how much you have stored up doesn't really matter, what does matter is how quickly you are getting it. Personally, I like this system a lot and find it more realistic.    


There are five basic unit categories in the game. 

ACU: The Armored Command Unit, it is the only unit you start out with. It can build stuff, shoot stuff, and upgrade itself. The best part? If it dies it explodes with the force of a hydrogen bomb :)

Engineers: build stuff, make factories build faster, and can ""hack"" enemy units and buildings.

Land units: kills stuff on land

Air Units: transports land units and kills stuff just about everywhere

Naval Units: are more powerful (and expensive) that the other types of units, and, you guessed it, they kill stuff on (and under) the water
 

There are a TON of different buildings to make so I wont go into too much detail. There are land, air, and naval factories, loads of turrets for different purposes, artillery, and intel structures, as well as advanced structures and assorted resource-related stuff. 


There are three main tech levels. Basically, when you build a factory of any sort, you can build engineers (and of course military units) from it. you can upgrade the factory to the next tech level at any time and get access to new units and better engineers, with access to more advanced buildings. The only individual units which can be upgraded are your ACU and some other buildings. 

PS. There are also MASSIVE experimental units for each faction, each with the power of an entire lesser army. thay are built like buildings and many include these as tech 4, but I cant help but think of them as seperate.


There are four factions in the game, each with its own appeal and advantages.


UEF:  The United Earth Federation, the humany humans of the game, mechs, bullets, and tanks. They are pretty good at rushes and tend to have more in the way of armor and heavy assault units and less in the way of shields. 


Cybran: I really feel for these guys. In short, they're oppressed humans with cybernetic implants who want to free their bretheran from forced obedience programs. They are the undisputed masters of cloaking and stealth technology, and are optimised for surprise attacks. 


Aeon: the classic humans-with-alien-tech-who-are-quasi-religous. lots of lasers, powerful shields, and plenty of hover tanks *cough* Vanu *cough*. Their main thing is ""every unit must be as good as possible at its given duty and not be able to do anything else"". no filthy multi-tasking in the illuminate. This really comes out in their units and is favored by a lot of people.


And last but certainly not least (don't tick them off they blew up earth) THE SERAPHIM. Long story short, we nuked them on first contact (smart humans, seriously more should do that) they dissapproved of that for some reason and promptly alien-nuked us back, and so on and so forth. They don't seem to have an over-arching unit style, but thay are very good at turtling (great AA, good artillery, and best shields in the game). Their tech is sort of Enders game's Formics meet Halo's covenant.



All in all, an amazing game, 9/10, honestly the only thing that could make it better would be a map editor.

The only issue I really have with it, is that it's a standalone game and that they did not include these improvements in the base game, which could REALLY benefit from that.
Some examples:
- Better and smaller UI. Everything takes less clicks, is easier to find and takes up less space, giving you more space for glorious battles
- Graphics seem to have been improved a bit as well
- Land units now actually march in sensible formations from what I can tell. Previously the formation was torn apart when units were moving. This is better now.
- Units in general respond better and faster to commands. Terrain navigation is much smoother.
- Naval units no longer ignore commands are get stuck on terrain as far as I can tell. Previously naval units adopted ridiculously large formations and parts of your naval force would simply not move to a location if it thought there wasn't enough space. This might have possibly been, because naval units also had a tendency to get stuck on one another...
- Air units are easier to handle and operate more efficiently it seems. They also now finally use landing pads the way they were designed to be used: USE ALL OF THEM, not just one when issueing the refuel order. It was pathetic to see 50 air units circle 1 landing pad when 10 were available. Now they use everything as it should be.

The campaign spans another 6 missions which you can play as any of the 3 core factions with new units for each. However, you can't simply switch factions in the campaign and the missions do not change based on what faction you're playing.

There simply aren't too many reasons not to like supcom fa. In other legendary RTS games, battles are made in rock paper scissors-style. Spears defeat cavalry, cavalry archers and archers spears. And of course, upgraded units defeat weaker ones. In the background economy plays a big role. Thats ok, but it lacks deep multidimensional strategy that supcom offers. 

Battles are fought in underwater, groundlevel and air simultaneusly. Instead of dealing less damage to sub-optimal enemies, units have limited capability where they can operate. For example, cannons cant kill submarines and AA-guns are required to kill aircraft. This itself requires more thinking than just normal RTS. Most of the guns can shoot longer than they can see, so radar and scouting is required to utilize units full capasity. Game offers excellent radar and intel system, which ads even more to the strategy aspect. And when you you think this cant get any more complicated, game introduces intelligent missiles and missile defenses, energy shields, nuclear weaponry, EMP weapons and much, much more. In the background, your economy produces units instead of just buying them unlike any other RTS.

When you read negative comments of this game, you will notice two kind of players.

I was introduced to the SupCom franchise via Youtube after incidentally coming across Supcom 2 fanmade epic gameplay vids. A month later I bought Supcom 2.

It has been many years since then and I have always heard or read reviews of how Supcom 2 (which in my mind was a decent RTS) had failed to meet the high expectations of loyal fans from Supcom and Supcom FA. My curiosity urged me to discover a little more about this antique and not too long ago, I happened across a steam sale where the bundle pack was sold for 5 SGD (3.45 USD).

In a short timeframe, I have spent many hours into this game and it has left me astounded that such a relic has not been properly glorified. In other words, this game had happened upon us too early for its time. Rarely do we ever come across such a priceless bundle of packaged joy (at such a steal too!).

It had been frustrating but incredibly worth it when I first started this game. My base was constantly getting wrecked by early T1 units simply because I made the noob mistake of jumping to T2 at the start. Eco management in this game is incredibly different from SupCom 2 and when handled improperly, would cost you the game. I only learned about 'ghetto gunships' a week ago and had so much fun pounding enemy bases with 28 mech marines per T3 transports. 

There are really very little restrictions when playing this game and it forces players to abuse as much of the unit abilities as possible. Hell Starcraft 2 did not have this type of complexity when it comes to eco. (or unit management)

To my fellow RTS gamers out there that are still deciding to buy this antique, give this a shot and you might be pleasently surprised at how complex this game can be.

I'm pretty sure actual reviews aren't really something worth reading since no review can really live up to the glory of describing what this game details, so instead I'll leave some advice form what I've learned after years upon years of playing. Don't train in skirmish for mulitplayer. In skirmish, your battle will feel like the way a war should be, with factories cranking out weapons and armies for you to lead to anihilate your opponent. You will lead your armies and crush enemy bases ending everything with a bang as you finally crush their commander. Multiplayer can only best be described through the question of, ""What would have happened if the Cold War went hot?"" Nuclear warfare on a grand scale and combat revolving around reconassaince and survival wages on in the lobbies. That is, atleast when I used to play.

For my money, the best RTS ever. It keeps you focused on the action while not over-simplfying everything to do so (See: Supreme Commander 2) in the best way. This game also shows how quality of life improvements for the player actually give you so much more freedom to strategize and work on complex tactics. 

One example, which is simple but so obvious, is how air transports work. In other games maybe it makes sense for air transporting units to be a manual, intensive affair if the combat is squad based and micro, but in SC it feels like you're AT WAR and you don't have time to deal with loading some land unit you had auto-built for basically no money onto a transport. Instead, you set up a ferry route, which automates your transport to pick up any units at X and transport them to Y. Then, you set the waypoint of your unit factory to the ferry beacon. BAM - you have units being tansported automatically to the front lines of the battle, which never seems to stop.

There are so many viable strategies (at least in single player, i'm not a mutliplayer guy), that depending on the map and the race you land on every game can feel slightly different. This game perfectly itches my RTS 'turtling' instincts - with UEF you can set up insane defenses, then eventually build a massive artillery battery that can win the game by itself. The sound and visual of that thing firing is incredibly satisfying.

- Land, Sea and Air warfare that is functional and relevant
- Decent shielding mechanics
- Great scale, it big but not unmanageable with some practice in multitasking and prioritising
- Resources being and fluid asset, rather than paying up front you pour metal and energy into a build. This means with proper resource management you can aggressively adjust you building strategy quickly while not wasting resources to a cap.
- Build rate basically a third hidden resource, when correctly managed is an amazing asset to resource expenditure
- All projectiles are simulated meaning you can dodge artillery by moving out of the way once it has fired

To this day, I have never played a game quite like Supreme Commander. Originally, the spiritual successor to the genre-defining ""Total Annihilation"" (which I love, if not simply for the fact that it's a 2D game, that truly believes itself to be 3D.)

Not since TA, had I played an RTS with real-time projectile simulation. Not since TA, had I played an RTS with fully realised naval warfare. Not Since TA, had I played a game with such a neat and intuitive Flux-Economy. Not Since TA, had nukes terrified me.

Meet Supreme Commander. The game that does it all. Better, for the most part. (tanks could in theory hit a fighter jet, but unlike TA, you cannot actually target your howitzers on gunships) Oh, and there's giant, stompy, death dealing, Mazer firing, ground shaking, base breaking, experimental class units too. From the Monkeylord, (A huge, amphibious, robotic spider with a Microwave laser on it's back, intergrated stealth field and surface-to-air missile launchers) To the Galactic Collosus, (Think the Iron Giant, tractor claws the size of your house, and toes as big as a tank. Oh, a face melting beam of purification.)  The CZAR, (Independance day mothership) to the Atlantis, (An aircraft carrier that is also a submarine) and the Fatboy, (A mobile tank factory that is also itself, a tank. A tank that carries 4 battleship turrets, can drive on the sea floor, projects it's own protective shield bubble and can perform repairs on allied aircraft.) 

This game provides no shortage of ways to reduce your opponent along with all he (or she) holds dear to scrap. Superheated scrap, being propelled at considerable speed after having had an alien nuke land a couple hundred metres away.

The game provides 4 factions that despite being so similar in terms of core game functionality, (this is not your starcraft, where each race builds and expands in entirely different ways, (AND the simmilarities of the races does make sense in lore!)) have their own very unique play styles.

The Cybran Nation: Fast, Stealthy units designed for harrassing the enemy wherever they can. Whilst not the best in a standup fight, (their units generally have the weakest armour) do have some of the games most devastating weaponry and you'd be hard pushed to see them comming. Has an aerial gunship for every tier. Wrecks faces.

The Aeon Illuminate: Specialised, Single-Purpose units that excel at their roles. Many of their units can hover, allowing for a very mobile amphibious attack force. Their mainline units have some of the longest ranges out there but they can be quite slow. Many units can be bolstered with cheap and efficient shielding. Can dominate the skies.

The United Earth Federation: Heavy Firepower, Heavier Armour. Never one to shy away from a fight, a UEF commander has the best options available when it comes to digging in. Good fire rates, good armour and a diverse range of offensive tools. Fairly even mix of fast harrassment units and slow, heavy hitting base breakers. Strong naval warfare.

The Seraphim: ""Alien Floaty bits"" An agressive race with advanced technology. Many fast moving assault units with high fire rates, capable of swarming and causing a ton of damage. Arguably has the strongest Combat Armoured Command Unit, with lightning fast self-repair systems. Combines relentless frontline assaults with flanking air cover and drops.

Now yes, the companies responsible for this game are now nonexistant and as a result, there is no developer support available. However there is a hub, run by the community for the community called, ""Forged Alliance Forever."" This community provides regular updates and balance patches for all those running their free game lobby. The FAFfers (as they call themselves) are the lifeblood of the game in it's current state. Multiplayer server hosting, balancing, bug fixing, custom maps, custom mods, performance enhancements and so much more besides.

For those still unsure, I cannot reccommend enough that you watch the youtubers ""Gyle"" and ""BRNKoINSANITY"" (and if you search one, you're bound to find the other) I have watched hundreds of matches casted by these guys and every single one is different. In Supreme Commander one thing is certain. Nothing is certain. 

Do I recommend this game? A thousand times, yes.

Do yourself a favour, and pick up the greatest Real-Time-Strategy title that the modern world has seen. (Humble Opinion)

Oh, and do yourself another Favour. Play this, love this, but stay away from Sup Com 2 unless you're taking it with an ocean's worth of salt. (same goes for Planetary Annihilation... such dissapointment)",1365611006,1480391288,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

So, even if you feel that you are playing the same game as good as the first one, it is slightly different, .. like a brand new very good SUPREME COMMANDER. 
A new experience, and to alternate playing the first SC with SCFA is an other way to never get bored with this game.
The campaign is great, but it is also an amazing RTS for big skirmish or LAN PARTIES up to 8 players and a lots of Air Land Sea Maps  where you can build up to a thousand units to fight with.
Graphics and sounds are still perfect today for you to dive in and get dragged by the rythm of the action.
Graphics are Sid Meiers' CIVILIZATION III' style with way better graphics and effects.
You can move the camera in any ways and zoom in and out during the game or when you watch the full recorded replay if you save it after the game.
It works fine on Windows 7/64 and Windows 10 but you may have to check the XP compatibility mod on the EXE of the game.
There may be a way to play it through Hamashi but I did not try it yet.
Today, I am still playing this gem, and like with a Civilization game, when you stop playing, you will still think about what happened and what strategy you could try next time to beat the very good A.I. or your friends and then, you will long for the next party.

The sheer scale of supreme commander is part of its appeal - the smallest unit is as tall as a tree, your commander towers many times taller than that and the 'experimental' endgame units are many times larger than even that. The excellent physics simulation and solid unit animations make the light units feel agile, while hulking mechanical monstrosities shake the earth with each ponderous step. Maps start at five kilometres square, and end at 81x81km strategic nightmares where it feels like troop movements take forever. All areas of combat are accounted for - land, sea, air and intelligence (even space, sort of) are each a powerful tool, and a game's outcome can be decided by any one of them. Weapons range from those wielded by rank and file units to fight one another, to strategic nuclear missiles and enormous artillery pieces able to fire clean across most maps. Each and every projectile is simulated - a launching nuclear missile can impact on enemy aircraft flying overhead. Units can physically block incoming fire from vulnerable targets. A high-flying bomber can accidentally bomb an interceptor flying beneath it.

Making all this manageable is an excellently implemented strategic zoom and robust waypointing system that allows orders to be queued long in advance to make best use of your limited attention. And your attention will be limited - there is so much to keep an eye on in supreme commander that you'll always have something to be doing. Upgrading your economy, managing units, keeping ahead of the tech curve and making sure your ACU, the commander at the core of your forces is safe. The commander is an exceedingly powerful engineering unit, but is also the most powerful combat unit on the field in the early stages of the game, and as a result using him aggressively can be the best way to gain the upper hand. This creates a somewhat unique mechanic in which your lose condition must fight on the front lines in order for you to survive, creating great tension.

It may be a bit graphically dated, as well as demanding significant single-threaded performance, but its strengths in UI, scope, unit and strategy diversity still shine as much as they did when it was released. The automatition and construction planning options are likewise second to none in the genre, allowing to truly focus on the big picture, long term plans and multiple assaults at once.

Thanks to the rate-based energy and mass economy, sacrificing an army or two as a diversion or loosing a fleet or even base to a clever ploy is no big deal, so you can both experiment and take risks. Most maps are big enough to comfortably house a bunch of backup facilities anyhow. Not to forget the endgame units are both a great way to dramatically resolve too balanced battle situations and just tons of fun to see unleash their might amongst smaller foes. 

The storyline missions are nice enough. Sure the dialog is a little ridiculous at times, but it has a bit of B-Movie charme and gives each faction a nice coloration, motivating to go through all of them. They also don't hold your hand much. While this is a standalone expansion to the original, you're expected to know your way around enough to dive right into it once you decide to tackle the campaign. This also means less filler missions though. But the real meat is in the multiplayer, which, especially with mods, offers almost endless replayability. There are some great balance tweaks, the all-important sorian AI improvements and the fun commander updates and new endgame units of Black Ops, for example, but many mods and a very much alive fan-made multiplayer project still exist (though as the steam version added matchmaking services, it's not even needed to enjoy it). 

Despite being older, I consider this superior to both its successor (Supreme Commander 2) as well as the spiritual successor planetary annihilation.

Some strategy games allow you to build a 'wonder' to win; here you instead build experimental units that roll over the map rather than trigger a boring win counter.
Reckless rushing and failed attacks are punished - wrecks of destroyed units can be salvaged, so a failed attack can go into the opponent's pocket, providing unique comeback potential if the attacker can't maintain constant pressure.
Resources are spent gradually over the time of building/unit construction instead of in bursts.

Now, for the downsides.
The official multiplayer is dead, however the community managed to establish a new server (google Forged Alliance Forever).
For some this is a plus, but there's only 1 real win/lose condition: respectively, destroy all the enemy Armoured Command Units (ACU) to win or have your own ACU destroyed to lose. This can lead to frustrating sniping, as each player starts with only 1 ACU and there's no way to acquire extra ones.

the game has a large variety of units and structures and has a small modding community aswell. there are 4 factions each with their own specialities, from navy that can walk on land to heavy T3 point defences. 
The battles can be massive with thousands of units on field, the game seems to have a system of time dilation where if someone is experiencing poor performance the game will slow down so it can perform all the events that are happening.

One of the greatest RTS games of all time.

If you like commanding hundreds of sea, air, and land units please read on.

Don't let the low hours on Steam trick you. Eight of my friends and I bought this game on CD years ago. We would routinely play 6 to 8 co-op or multiplayer (free for all) games on LAN before the Internet speeds really got fast. I've got at least 1000 hours in this game with all the weekend LAN parties hosted at a bachelor pad.

This game ruined my RTS experience by introducing or near perfecting some techniques.

1. Virtually unlimited queueing of orders (patrol, move, etcetera). I've never hit a limit. I would reckon that I have had at least 100 orders queued without any issue to tens of different unit groups.
2. Large scale battles. Each side can have hundreds of units (we've had 8 sides in one large battle).
3. Mouse zoom in/out. I can't explain in words the many ways this feature is plain useful and should be the standard in RTS games. You can zoom into a low level (one unit) and out to see the entire map and units are then represented as particular icons (easily identifiable). You can issue any command or select any unit from low to high level zooms. It's plain awesome.
4. True faction faction and unit differences. Big difference between tier 1, 2, 3, and experiental units.
5. Interesting upgrade paths for commander with multiple paths (Builder, fighter, stealth, etc).
6. Short cut keys to do same thing as mouse.
7. Four factions that look, feel, and really behave different.
8. True land, sea (above and below), and air units.
9. Transports (air or sea) with fantastic transport queueing/ferry options.
10. Graphics look great, even for an old game.
11. Replayability (different campaigns as different factions, co-op, multiplayer, maps)
12. Experimental units.
13. Game balance. Almost every unit has a counterpart. Want to nuke people? Want to build anti-nuke system?
14. Automation of engineers (patrol duty) to clear battle fields of wrecked metal or terrain and repair stationary units.
15. Massive selection of buildings and units
16...I'm sure I'm leaving stuff out.

I'm trying to convince my wife to let me buy five more copies when on sale for my children. There are a few potty words in the campaign (hell, damn, etc) so I'm not sure if I can yet. I started to play this game again after years of playing other games. This RTS set the standard in so many areas that is effectively made me a critic of other RTS games that could continue the standard and improve it. None have.

Note: I am playing with Windows 10 64-bit operating system with Supreme Commander and Forged Alliance executables set to Windows compatibility (Windows XP SP2). If I do not set this, then game crashes between levels. With it set, I haven't crashed yet.",1476823598,1479621819,True,0,0,0.497611463069915771,0,True,False,False

definitely check out the faforever.com :)

this game has very large battles, what i miss in recent games.
the gameplay is complex in the beginning but its quickly learned. a big plus here is you don't have to micro manage the workers. you can command them to assist in an area and they repair and help building. very nice feature indeed.

newer games just look good but have no essence anymore. ...

Also despite the fact that the game released long time ago, it is still very interesting.

You will definitely like this game in two cases:
1. StarCraft 2 is too fast for you and you prefer to use tactics instead of ""Actions Per Minute"" skill.
2. You like the game ""Wargame"" (or similar games) but you don't like a lack of possibility to construct buildings and gather resources.
This game is much slower than StarCraft, have much larger scales but also allows to construct bases. So you probably will like it.

Also, not anyone knows, but the game still have strong community and you can easily find a game to play PvP up to 4x4 or even 6x6 players.
Community of this game created a service for multiplayer, you may find details here: faforever.com
You can found some video of PvP on Youtube and you will note that the game is very tactical.

Another interesting fact, at first glance you may think that most units of all 4 factions is similar.
But actually they have very different characteristics. You may found units database on the website above and explore how to use different advantages or disadvantages of different units and factions.

Also, if you played Planetary Annihilation (which is similar to this game), take a note that Supreme Commander have a lot of features which is not available in PA, such as:
 - Shields
 - Large air transport
 - Better aviation

If you have a decent pc and can run it at medium graphics youll love what you see. For and older game its gameplay sets it apart from games with godly graphics [starcraft 2 im staring at u]. The addition of the Seraphim really changes the pace of this in gamplay [when compared to sup com 1] due to the fact this game really likes to have you feel a particular way when you fight against different factions. I dont pvp but thats since i dont have people i can play it with and trust [tac nuking allies.....]. So wheni fight AI and their UEF im just rolling out the strat bombers. Cybrans r the best [More AOE than others of its type] to counter fatboys. Aeon the gotdamned Colossus r Godly and have the largest Health so bombing should do it but need more than u would need to build for fatboys. it will melt your ACU. The seraphim...... Well....... Awassa i forget the spelling but its payload is a tac nuke bomb so its not nice to run into. Cybran are pretty balanced but dangerous still. I like the monkeylord its got everything covered and it will steamroll in groups of 2 and 3. The Base building is everything i like in a stratagy game. their is allways something to build/upgrade not all stratagy games let u upgrade you income [C&C 3 is a decent example]. the defenses r different for each factions as well. Uef gets gatling gun t3, aeon gets rapid fire arty that is just devestating, Cybran have the f#%$ u of the sea with a t3 naval defense that can ONLY be hit by torps leaving u with few options to counter. The only generic similarites are between the resource structures [for balance] as well as Tactical Nukes and SMDs so no complaints. My only problem is....... WHAT HAPPENED with SUP COM 2???????? Its what i started with ind i kept hearing sup com 1 is better. i thought that was impossible. If you like RTS stratagy and you like having diverse units and factions this game does it and its got good scale as well. For it being old its a well made game even today. If youve made it this far.

There is one new campaign that can be played through three times, once for each faction, with some differences in dialogue and secondary objectives between factions. New units add to mid- and late-game strategy, and the new faction gives greater variety in multiplayer games.

What sets Supreme Commander apart from other RTS games is a combination of in-game cinematic graphics and the tactical nature of viewing the field. A player can rotate the map in almost any direction and at any angle to see units firing on each other. This is the first RTS game I've played that uses zooming for navigating the field as an alternative to a minimap. If you zoom out far enough, units show up as icons that immediately tell the player what role each unit plays. This unique ""tactical view"" also has a dual-screen mode, which allows the player to monitor and act on two places on the battlefield at once.

The community of Forged Alliance players is still alive and well, with thousands of active players on a community-driven lobby (Forged Alliance Forever, FAF) that also keeps the game up-to-date.

If you're new to the RTS genre or too unfamiliar with Supreme Commander's mechanics to play a skirmish match, then you should play through the campaign. The story is average but it does ease you into the game so you can better enjoy a skirmish match.

Forged Alliance, similar to the original SupCom, have a very uncoordinated AI. I often see a bunch of units, given the same order to move, endlessly bump into each other until I separate them individually. The per-unit micro-management can get quite distracting when you have 500 other units on the map. Fortunately, there are mods that alleviate this issue. I must still credit the AI however, for being able to traverse across maps that are 81km x 81km in size.

Graphics are nice for an RTS of this age and most modern graphics cards should be able to run the game well on high settings. I should point out though that Forged Alliance isn't well optimised for multicore processors, so if your CPU is more than six years old then it better be top-of-the-range otherwise the game will start to lag after about half an hour in large AI skirmishes.

So it's the game I utterly love, but it doesn't return the favor too well.

[The Bug:
Yes, I'm talking about the slowdown due to the AI calculating paths and what not, so that your session will inevitably end up in a stop motion manner - but that's something we have to live with. (There are ways to work around it, but nothing can stop it entirely.)]

Back to the topic:
You are a supreme commander controlling an army up to 1000 units, but instead of counting high tier units as 2 or 5 points, it really means 1000 ""things"" - that could either be small units and buildings or 1000 giant experimental spiderrobots with huge lasers.
That's up to you and your resources, which you don't gather the normal way, but trough a constant flow of the two: energy and mass. If you get more, you can build more or faster and if the supply stops, you can resume the process until you fixed your resupply. This ends up in an interesting economy, that really provides the basis of massive warfare.

And warfare is massive indeed, as you try to form every rock and every bit of energy on the map into something you can throw at your enemy. The fun thing is, that the most advanced (experimental) units usually provide the best firepower and endurance in combat in most RTS games, but the smaller units will never go unused in SupCom, because 200 tanks/robots/gunships can deal as much havoc as one big pile of steel and guns. 
It's always a matter of choice and not one the devs force on you.

Get the game and have fun, (if you like the genre).

The only thing left to recommend is, that you should play the Forged Alliance campaign first, because the six missions it offers are huge - the map will be revealed further after certain checkpoints - and you don't have to unlock every unit in what seems to be 100 missions in the main game. 
(You can still play the main game after FA, if you're hungry for some more, but then you'll know much better what you should do and how you can achive victory with the low-tech units the game forces you to use for the first bunch of missions.)

For muliplayer, check ""Forged Alliance Forever"". It's a great mod and a lobbysystem that keep the competitive part alive.

Forged Alliance has an advanced strategic system that will tear an iron fist down.  the balancing between air, land, and naval combined warfare gives the game a feel to it that gives the player a clear freedom to dominate how they want.  the three different factions are well balanced, but all offer clear advantages, for example as Cybran, I will find myself getting assault bots picked off by aeon units, but when I notice I dominate them, however, if I cannot react in time, I may be too late.  the economic system is simple, however difficult to retain, and a key component to winning.  a tech tree gives this game a three front battle, tactics, economy, and tech.  all three must be balanced if a player is to win.  this game however is  drawn back by it's low framerates, and online play can be moderate in it's overall lag.  The community is flowing with many still playing the base game, and a new community in Forged Alliance Forever (look it up for more details).  Competitive play gives this game a feel that is sure to last.  As I have already stated, Forged alliances balancing ensures that powerhouse players do not win through simple swarming, however, conservationalism has drawbacks as well.  eliminating overpowering extremes and promoting fair play.

There are ram limitations in the game engine which means that if you play with 4 ai bots or more your game will slow down to slow motion in late game. This happens because the engine cant use all the memory of your computer.

The game is still worth a shot though as it is a unique strategic experience that you wont find in mosto ther strategy games. I personally love it even though it has ram limitations.

Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is probably the shinest gem out there that still blows all the other next generation RTS games by this day. 

It has nearly everything that an RTS must have, the necessities and unique features, such as faction diversity, adjacency bonuses, and mod support as well. It may seem complicated at first, but you get used to it pretty fast, as it is easy to learn.

The community is still alive and working here, usually hanging on the Forged Alliance Forever lobby mod, which optimizes the game further and adds working multiplayer lobbies, ranked matchmaking, and so forth.

Each unit from each faction serves a vital role in your great conquest across the the entire battlefield, lots of diversity into them as well.

Like all RTS games you start with a few basic units, usually just your commander.  You then build factories, resource gathering, and military.  You then Explore, expand exploit and exterminate.  In supreme commander you have 4 tiers of units T1 to T3 and then experimental units, which are very expensive and take a long time to build, but are essentially game enders.  Each of the 4 races has its own unique units, strengths and weakenesses.  The experimentals also fill fairly specific roles, making enemy engineer capture a significant boost to your combat power.  It has been out long enough now that the units are all pretty well balanced.

Originally Cavedog Entertainment created a game called Total Annihilation.  At the time it was considered the best RTS game, ever.  Chris Taylor later left Cavedog to form his own studio and worked on a spiritual successor to his best-selling TA game.

It's hard to describe to today's generation what SupCom was like when it first came out.  It was the first triple-A title that really utilized dual-core (and above) systems;  In an era where you had to force most games to run on a single CPU lest they crash, SupCom adored it, loved it, reveled in it.  It would drive the top-end system into the ground with its rich, lush graphics and absolutely enormous battles.

It's also the first game that I can recall which specifically had built-in support for multi-display.  One monitor could show you the ground fight, and on the second monitor you could either have a different camera view or a scaled-up map view.

There are too many things to list which were innovated in this game.  Here's a by-no-means exhaustive list:

* First game to really show what multi-core computers could do with gigantic 1000+ unit battles.

* First pure simulation grand scale RTS, with no RPG-like dice rolls.  If a mega-gun launches a projectile at you, you can dodge it if your unit is fast enough and you are good enough at microing.  Every missile and bullet is simulated when it leaves the barrel.  This made the game a micro-lover's dream.

* First game to support multi-monitor, allowing you to configure each display as you want.

* First use of a wide-scale camera.  You could zoom all the way out to 30k altitude and view the battle as a series of stategic icons, or zoom all the way in and watch each individual shell land on the enemy.

* First use of ""zoom at where I'm looking"" smart camera.  Seriously, I wish more people would utilize this mechanic.  In most RTS games you had to keep your hands on the keyboard at all times despite the game being 90% mouse driven, just so you could move the camera around.  But in SupCom, they made it so when the camera zooms in, it focuses on the point where your cursor is situated.  This makes for an incredibly smooth playing experience, where you feel like you have total control over your view of the battle field.

* First RTS where indirect fire is a critical aspect of gameplay.  Most units can actually launch projectiles or shells at least 10% further range or so outside of their radar detection range.  Other units which had wider radar detection ranges could be coupled with indirect-fire units to maximize your effectiveness.  Early scout units were always useful because of this.  SupCom was never a case of ""build unit X until you win"" sort of game, against competent players you had to have a mix.

* Innovative resource system inherited from TA which leads to very intense economy management.  Instead of buying units for a fixed cost from a fixed pool of ""money,"" you deal with resources in a producing/consumed sliding scale.  This meant that build order was the king, particularly at the beginning of the game, and you had to be careful with how you spent your resources.  Your factories would never refuse to build a unit if your resource production level was low;  They would just take more and more time.  Conversely, if you over-produced but didn't consume enough, you were likely wasting materials and giving an advantage of the enemy who might not be so frugal.  Because of this, each match is a constant tweaking of your economy.  You had both mass (used for building) and energy (used for powering things) to keep track of.

* Wreckage.  Yeah, it's there just to look cool, but it also contains mass which can be reclaimed.  Build a mega-unit and send it to the enemy base and -- oh no, it dies!  Now, not only did you lose your chance, but you've just given the enemy a huge economy boost.  You really had to think about sending in the heavies, as it was possible to give aid to the enemy just by your failures alone.

* Stealth mechanic which allowed you to coordinate sneak attacks and all kinds of fun assassin-style missions against the opponent.  One of the three factions is geared towards stealth play.  (Cybrans forever!)

* AMAZING control over what your factories and units can do.  Want to have a master factory and 6 others which mirror what it does?  Doable!  Want to have a certain factory to exit a unit and then have it automatically patrol a particular route?  Doable!  Want to edit patrol paths once they are defined?  No problem!  Smart engineer units which automatically assist or reclaim wreckage?  Ayup!

* Adjacency economy boosting system.  Factories placed near power sources get a reduction in their power consumption.  But they also get mass-cost reductions when placed near mass sources.  This meant you were always search for the most optimal building configuration to maximize your economy, usually altered by the terrain.

* Upgradable commander unit.  SupCom had a single powerful hero unit which could be upgraded via research to give it extra abilities.  Most of these abilities were mutually exclusive, so you had to think about what approach you would take.

* Pretty decent single-player campaign that's entertaining and fun to replay as different factions.  It's no Starcraft in that regard but I think it's held up fairly well.

* (Sadly no longer applicable.)  Very active eSports community, with frequent and entertaining matches.  Game supports a built-in replay mechanism which allows you to watch matches with ease.

* Tons of really awesome mods which expanded the life of the game, such as Sorian AI (which fixed the fairly braindead default AI) and Black Ops (adds a ton of new units).

* SupCom:FA adds to the already excellent SupCom by introducing a new single player campaign, new experimental units, all new maps, and a new faction (which admittedly, was kinda broken and way overpowered until the bugs were patched out).


Seriously, this game was amazing.  A LOT of thought went into its design and implementation.  SupCom: FA literally ruined all other RTS games for me.  I cannot play them without thinking, ""Gee, I wish I was playing SC:FA instead.""

This is Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. Obviously takes place in the future where people build robots to fight for them in a huge war known as the... 1000-Year War I believe? Anyway, 3 factions are fighting for Galactic Supremacy for their own, but the other 2 factions stand in their way... In Forged Alliance, an alien race called the Seraphim, was once annihilated by the Xenophobic humans. This time, they come back, and they aren't the peace loving aliens they were once known as.
The Seraphim go on a Galactic Conquest to wipe out all humans for nearly putting their entire race to extinction. Now the humans are coming to extinction and the only way to fight back is for the 3 factions to unite and push back the Seraphim invasion.

Now let's talk about gameplay:
This game has a large variety of units, with 3 tech stages (1,2, and 3). There is also a special stage 4, which are the EXPIRAMENTALS! I put EXPIRAMENTALS in all Caps because let me tell you, they are BIG-ASS Giant ROBOTS of Mass Destruction! 
Unlike most RTS games where there's a population limit, Supreme Commander basically has no limit (Well, unless if you count 1,000 units as a limit). Also, all units only take up 1 point of population, so you can literally have up to 1000 units. 

Now there are a few consequences for having such a large limit, LAG. Trust me, Supreme Commander takes alot of processing power, and you probably will not always run at 30 FPS or so.

I recommend this game, It's fun. I'm sorry that's all that I can really say.

ALSO, I would recommend you download Forged Alliance Forever (FAF), it's kinda like a community-made add-on that allows you to play online with other players (Because normal servers are done for), it also has mods for the game that you can mess around with your friends with.

This one specially the best of the whole franchise. The game engine and dynamics gives you a smooth game play experiance. It really makes you feel the same like you play Total Annihilation. Nearly same tech tree. Very nice and fun to play units and same game mechanics. you even have ""D"" gun on your commander too.

I love the single player missions in Forged Alliance. I can play them again and again and again.

I am an hardcore turtle. I always build a huge citadel like not a single unit can pass through and slowly build a brutal offensive force and destroy my enemy in a single hit. I used to play Total Annihilation in same way. I can spend hours in a single player campaign chaper to stabilize my citadel. This game allows me to do that. Also it expands the map during missions which gives me more citadel building options. Specially in hard mode being a turtle can be challenging too.

Do not look at my play time. I play this game 100+ hours in offline mode. I finished the whole campaigns with all kind of options i can imagine. even i captured an enemy builder and used only enemy units. I have built a commander army to defeat my enemy. I tried all kind of army combinations. I even used offensive turret building and i still can play the game withouth getting bored.

I loved the large unit concept which is called experimental units in the game. you can build huge expensive but strong robots to deal with your enemies. in the first game and the last one the experimental unit balance and feeling doesnt as good as in  Forged Alliance. 

What i most love about this game is the resource management. very simple but the way you use it is unique to the this game. you constandly generate non finishing resources and constandly spend them. management here is the difference between expence and income.

Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is a great RTS game that offers an experience like no other. The battles take place on a huge scale with maps ranging from 5km x 5km to 81km x 81km. The sheer size might sound pretty cool, but then you get into more small scale. Base building in this game mixes micro and multitasking with managing multiple bases at a time. Nearly everything in this game is upgradeable in some way, so you have to manage whats upgrading while managing unit production and income. You have to remember to upgrade your ACU so you get the benefits from it, all while remembering to build defenses and intel bases. Base building in this game is also really awe inspiring. Different buildings get buffs from other buildings, such as the energy generator, energy storage, and mass fabricator. These all affect each other in some beneficial way, stressing the need for a good base lay out heavily. The fact that nukes and artillery shells can hit a plane in flight also amazes me. 

This game offers some really awesome experiences and has a real need for a good strategy.

Supcom effortlessly joins relatively simple concepts such as mass extraction and energy generation with tiered technology and layered complexity to create a game that at no point seems overwhelming, but always keeps the player engaged. I cant remember any time in the game I felt like I was coasting, or I had nothing to do, as the tremendously effective AI always keeps you on your toes, and whether you are a new player, or a veteran, there's a difficulty for you. I also can't say there was any time, save perhaps one instance, where I rage quitted. Supreme Commander is one of thos games where losing is just as fun and spectacular as winning. Hearing that STRATEGIC LAUNCH DETECTED, or seeing an experimental bomber bearing down on your base are the kinds of twists and turns in the game that level designers would work to make by hand, Supcom acheives them on a regular basis just by operating within its own well implemented rules.

Nice to know that FA Forever keeps a multiplayer community alive. There aren't many mods, but the game does have in built support, including one for expanded unit limits (though I haven't confirmed whether it works, since I focus on turtling and experimentals and never hit the cap).
Addition of the Seraphim faction is nice as it gives an alien race some show in this game, though honestly the four factions aren't too different apart from their experimentals and a few strengths and weaknesses. I don't mind too much, as Total Annihilation only had TWO factions which were almost identical. All the experimentals are unique, though, and the biggest attraction for me. Unfortunately managing fewer powerful units is far easier than managing a large army, but there are advanced controls to help you. And there is a way to fast forward the speed in the campaing with + and - minus keys which I took forever to figure out. Sure helped eliminating the wait time for my armies and defences.
The story's quite a bit shorter with one campaign across all three races (your choice) and not too memorable, but blowing up my enemies with 20+ gigantic flying saucers and skyscraper mechs is always satisfying and makes my day.

Seriously, everything I liked about TA is in SupCom in some fashion, but better. SC added features that (at the time) no other RTS had, like the megamap. Now, if your game doesn't have a megamap, don't bother to come to school - the other kids will just laugh and push your face into the dirt. Looking at you, [i]Ashes[/i].

Shields are also a favorite of mine. In TA and other RTSes, when your defenses repel the infidels, they take damage that must be repaired. With shields, as long as the bubble stays up, the shield will regenerate over a relatively short period, and the defenses will keep on keepin' on. There are mods that add super bubbles (shields) that can stop practically anything, which leads to some ""battle of Hoth"" instances where ground forces must be sent in to take out the shield generator (if you sprint units inside the shield, they can attack things within) before the long-range bombardment destroys everything else. 

It is super fun.

The game isn't perfect, though. The one overriding issue, apart from the developer being dead and no official multiplayer list servers, is performance. The game was developed in a time where dual-core PCs were a new thing, and was quite revolutionary in its multithreaded design. The simulation and the rendering pipeline are broken out to two threads, and this helps the game run fast on multicore systems. 

Unfortunately, the sim thread could really use being broken down into multiple threads itself. Mid to late game, even though the FPS will still be 100+, units will act slow. They move slow, react slow, missles and cannon shots will move slower. This is the sim thread being overwhelmed by the 2000+ units running about. Since the dev is gone, this will never be fixed, and that's a damn shame since the game is practically the perfect RTS otherwise.

You can see trees, ground, hear birds etc. You found smth new on every map. You need to be atentive to buildings, landscape etc, you need explore. Losing 1 unit can be important.

Large scale battles with thousands of units under the command of 2-8 players (12 on some custom made maps). Many maps ranging from 5 square kilometers, all the way up to 81 square kilometers - just shy of 50 square miles! - and yes, they really do feel that large.

Pros:

[list]
[*]This game is tons of fun whether you're playing alone or with family and friends
[/list]

Playing alone is great; playing with friends is pure awesomeness.

[list]
[*]Very high attention to even some of the smallest details.
[/list]

There are tons of moving parts. If you go up close, you can see all the tank treads spinning, as well as multiple parts of legs making coreographed motions to create movement.

If a unit has more than one weapon, each weapon will by physically present on the unit, and each projectile will appear different.

If there is a unit that has a passive ability, for example shielding, or radar jamming, you will see that there is a physical part on the unit that creates this effect. What's better is that it will even resemble the actual building structures that use the same effects, to a certain degree.

One of my favorite examples of the above is the Cyrbran Tech 2 Tactical Missile Defense structure and the Cybran Tech 3 Siege Assault Bot. The T3 Bot has it's own personal Tactical Missile Defense system, and looking at the left shoulder will show a similar structure on it (in this case a shpere on a pillar). It even functions by shooting a small red laser at Tactical Missiles, returning them to sender!

[list]
[*]Truly massive scale battles.
[/list]

Up to 8 teams with up to 1,000 units/structures per team, or up to 8,000 in one game, all at the same time. This unit cap can be increased to 2,000 per team and 16,000 in one game with the Lobby Enhancement Mod. Further more, custom made maps can also increase the number of players to a maximum of 12, making the maximum unit/structure count go to a whopping 24,000!

[list]
[*] 4 factions with similar yet unique units and buildings
[/list]

Many units, while similar to one another, can vary so wildyl in combat that they can serve completely different purposes.

One example is the UEF and Cybran battleships. The UEF  battleship's main armaments consist of 3 turrets with 3 cannons per turret. It fires all three cannons per turret at the same time, dealing massive damage. The Cybran battleship's main armaments consist of 2 turrets with 3 cannons per turret. However, it fires only one cannon per turret, resulting in much lower damage, in exchange for much higher rate of fire.

[list]
[*] Strong community and many mods
[/list]

There is still quite a big following playing this game even today. You can find this community on the Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) servers. If I'm not mistaken, downloading the Forged Alliance Forever app will also give you the Sourian AI mod as well as the Lobby Enhancement Mod. Personally, I wouldn't skip these two mods for this game, especially the AI mod if you like to play against computers.

One of my absolute favorite features of FAF is the ability to play the campaign in co-op mode with friends. There are pletny of games being played every day from many players with ranging skill levels. You'll find tournaments and just for fun games alike. You'll also find a nice hand full of custom made maps you can download directly from the Vault in the FAF app.

Cons:

[list]
[*]The unit movement can get a little annoying at times
[/list]

Sometimes they'll get stuck or confused trying to walk around one another, and it can be frustrating, though I find this generally not to be much of an issue.

[list]
[*]The campaign is just okay.
[/list]

You are never forced to try harder to win; you can simply just test yourself on how fast you can do it. You can simply take your time to build up your army before advancing to the next checkpoint.

Playing co-op completely changes the experience for me. I guess I just like playing with friends and family.

[list]
[*]This game is highly CPU intensive.
[/list]

Older and lower tier CPUs simply cannot handle this game on it's maximum scale. Towards the end of matches, and especially longer ones against the computers, you will notice massive slow down in game play. The Sourian AI mod, while also more fun due to being more of a challenge, alleiviates a lot of this issue when compared to standar AI that was programmed into the game. The standard computers tend to build tons, and tons of units and leave them at the base for long periods of time, resulting in less fun, and more CPU usage which results in slower gameplay.

For example, an older rig I used with an AMD FX-6300 played the game just fine with 7 standard AIs, up until the end of the game where it was practically grinding to a halt. It was unplayably slow; roughly 3-4 real time seconds per game second. Now I'm using an Intel i7 4790k with the 7 Sourian AIs and I can easily play games well past the 2 hour mark with 0 slow down, with some head room to spare.

All in all, this game is an absolute blast to play! One of my favorite games that I own.",1450661616,1450948046,True,7,0,0.608772993087768555,0,True,False,False

Still probably the best RTS I've played (a genre that sadly seems to be dying), and easily one of my favorite games in general.


Pros:
- Great variety of units, both in numbers and utility.
- Excellent controls/UI/minimap system, makes handling massive numbers of units simple and intuitive.
- Fucking huge battles, there can be literally thousands of units on the field.
- Detailed building and unit models/animations.

Cons:
- Build times on some things can be painfully long.
- Story is kind of forgettable, and a little hard to follow.
- Outdated graphics (though they really aren't so bad that it detracts from the game).

Got the UEF, Cybran Aeon, and Serephim. Each fraction specialize in different areas. If its ground, navel or air. Thats your job to find out what each does. This is my top most FAVOURITE game!! I recommand this game 1000%!! 

Land:
You got you T1 units. Light tanks, light artillery, anti air and scout. Basic units with light armour light damge. Good units to harras someone with in the early game;)
You then have your T2 units. Meduim tanks/Walkers, missle launchers, shields and stealth troops. Great Units to over take a bunch of T1 and destroy base.
You got you T3 Units. Heavy tanks, mortor units and some ant air as well. Amzing troops for taking out just about anything. Even experimentals:0
You then got you experimentals. Got you Monkey Lord which is in the second picture, your Fat Boy which is also in the second picture in the back and much more ranging to air and artillery. Some dangerous and far range and some at close range. Dont want to get near these guy.

Air:
You got your T1 units. Interceptors, bombers, light gunships, scouts and transports. Great units to take control of the sky, for the beggining of course.
Got your T2 units. Gunships, fighter/bomber, suicides and transports. Great units to deny any ground attack coming your way.
You have your T3 units. Heavy gunships, Heavy bombers that are super deadly, and your fighter. Greaet troops to secure your air control and MURDER and enemy base.
Then you got your Experimentals. Deadly from the sky but has weak armour. One run from the Serephim bomber and your a goner. Got your saucers and your heavy, HEAVY gunship.

Navel:
You got your T1 Units. Frigates, Submarines, and anti air. Great units to take conrtol of the water and Tech up.
You got Your T2. Got your Destroyers, Cruisers and submarines. Great units to bombared the land from the water at a great distance. Use these units to support you ground and navel
You have your deadly T3 units. Battleships, cruisers and submarines with NUKES!!!!!!!!
Then got experimentals. got your omega submarine too your floating fortress!!

And of course you got your engineers. 

Structures:
Over 50 structures!!!! 50!!! Got you energy, mass, air and ground defences, artilerry, wall sections, troperdo defence, radar, land/air/navel factory and so much more. Even experimental structures. 

Resources: 
Now this is all cool but you cant just build them right away. Whats the fun in that. You got your 2 resources that are the most important thing in the game beside your commander. Let me repeat that, you got your 2 resources that are the most important thing in the game beside your commander!! You have your mass and energy. More you got, the faster you can build and tech up for better troops and structures. If you are low, might want to fix that because your enemy will take advantage of that.

Commander: 
Most important thing in the game. Your commander(Which is you) dies, its game over. Commander has several upgrades. Each fraction has different upgrades on there Com. Gun upgrade, Tech upgrade to stealth. Much that you wil have to find out for your self.

Well I think Iv'e said WAY too much already. Got carried away by how AMAZING this game is. Now it might say only 23 hours but Iv'e played over 500+ hours on my other account!! Also including all the hours I have played in FAF (Forged Alliance Forever). Come check out the website and download it. Thousands of people playing right now!! This is by far my most favourite game!! Join us!! Cmon. I know you want too:)

For me this is the best RTS I've ever played. The reasons for this are:
- Epic battles. Thousands of units of different size and shape on land, water and in the air. Battle between huge armies look really massive and epic.
- Great economy model. Buildings receive different bonuses from resource buildings nearby, encouraging you to plan your base's architecture. The game also has build/uprade assistance from constructors and reclamation.
- Micro doesnt play a major role, unlike in Starcrafts and other popular RTS tiles, where the winner is the one who does more clicks per second.
- Fractions seem alike a the first glance, but the small differences in unit's capabilities, like being amphibious, or having a shield, can become a huge advantage if used properly.
- Epic experimental units, capable of defeating small armies alone. They are all different and unique.
- Many small things that make the game comfortable, like building queues/plans, possible building distribution between factories, automated unit transportation from assembly point to te battlefield and many others.

Everyone has their ""top 5 games of all time"" list and this will remain on that list for the rest of my gaming life.  Since I first watched it in development to today, I have never stopped trumpeting just how amazing it really is.  I never miss a chance to try and convince every gamer I know to buy it.  I think I have donated at least five copies to my friends just to have them experiance it.

Nearly every RTS before and after have been about just tanks and infantry in small teams... Maybe 100 units at the very most.  Air was usually limited to planes that magically hover in the air and shoot at things until they ran out of ammo, and navy, if present at all, was far less effective than it should really be.  Nuclear weapons and WMD's in Command and Conquer or Starcraft would maybe kill a dozen units and destroy a couple buildings if placed properly.  Nukes in Supcom incinerate everything on the screen, as they absolutly should.

Supcom went beyond the level of being a video game and truly pushing the idea of a simulation.  Much like Steel Battalion or high end flight simulators, this game is less a game than it is an experiance.  High APM click-fests (Starcraft) are lauded as the best of the best in the unfairly small RTS genre, but relied far less on tactics and strategy than they did a small group (or in some cases, an individual unit) winning a single battle which mostly judged the outcome of the game.  Supcom recognized that warfare takes a long time, and even the fastest battles are often an attrition match.  The smallest fights often involve dozens of units on each side, with the largest brawls involving hundreds of tanks, artillery support from a secondary line, dozens of aircraft bombing the ground forces and fighting the other aircraft, and fire support from naval units miles away.  This is why Supcom will always stand out as the premier RTS of all time... it is the only one to recognize that there is more to it than a few tanks at a time... Ground air and sea work in conjunction to support eachother.

If you have never played this game before, you are truly missing out.  It is something that everyone needs to experiance.  There likely will never be anything else like it.  Even for an 8 year old game, it still looks and sounds amazing.  Nothing else has ever truly given the scale of a warfare simulation like Supcom does.  It is however, punishingly difficult to learn.  There is so much nuance to this game, that people often develop a misconception that the races are too similar when they first learn to play.  It isin't until a deep understanding of the game is reached does the vast differences between the factions becomes realized.  Each side has subtle differences that measure not just the raw stats of the units, but the entire playstyle and even the lore-based philosophy of the faction.  

Finally, you can't fanboy this game without mentioning the amazing community of FAF.  It took over running everything when GPG went down.  That so much support exists for a game this old and largely un-mainstream speaks more for it's merits than I ever could.

9420,18006655,76561198049837614,92,67,2594,0,232,1590257245,"Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is the type of Real Time Strategy game that plays well with old-school strategy gamers, requiring players to spend hours of sweat, blood, and tears before they can deploy their fleets of lumbering robots against their foe. SC:FA has great tactical depth and fetches a fair amount of complex resource-management and army organization, yet bears enough sheer RTS joy to appease both more casual and hard-core RTS gamers alike. With SC:FA‚Äôs blend of generic alien vs man sci-fi action thrown in with the politics of the previous game‚Äôs 3 human factions, the game also concocts a pretty enjoyable storyline to campaign with. 
The best way, I feel, to evaluate the game is to compare it to the more modern successor, Supreme Commander 2. SC2 has all the trappings of a modern RTS sci-fi product; flying, creeping, and hovering robots of all shapes and sizes zipping around a well sculpted battlefield, brightly colored lasers and missiles flying about under the player‚Äôs direction. Being of the same company and storyline, each game uses the same two resources and the same style of base building (with the usage of shields, turrets, and factories that produce everything from small tanks to submarine-aircraft carriers). The storyline of SC2 isn‚Äôt as important nor as interesting, but what makes both games stand out as frontrunners of the two different RTS genres is the differing styles of tactical gameplay and resource gathering.
Instead of varying sizes of landmasses, such as in SC:FA in which it can take twenty minutes for fuel-thirsty aircraft to reach the end of the map, SC2 possesses much smaller maps, where even the slowest units take no more than five minutes to reach point B. In terms of tactical management, aircrafts of all factions in SC:FA need refueled at specialized staging facilities. This isn‚Äôt relevant in SC2, with aircraft being able to fly over targets and friendly bases indefinitely. Also, a notable difference rests in the building of what is known in both games as ‚Äúexperimental units‚Äù or just unique units that are the culmination of your particular faction‚Äôs military genius (for example, the United Earth Federation‚Äôs Fatboy landship). The Fatboy unit in SC:FA can cross over water, possesses shields and anti-aircraft capabilities, and has very powerful guns, all at the cost of twenty minutes of time. However, in SC2, the Fatboy unit only wields the large guns, with all other abilities missing, giving the unit a much cheaper cost at a three minute production rate. These examples serve to set apart the two different RTS styles; the newer version represents how tactical depth and patience have been replaced by spectacle and awe.
To conclude, if you‚Äôre the type of gamer that likes to spend loads of time setting the pieces up in order to get to the nuclear explosions, then this is the game for you.

This game is how I want most RTS games to be, and to be honest, I think most RTS games [i] want [/i] to be SC:FA.

Let's start with the campaign. I won't put any spoilers, but I will list off a few things. Like most RTS games, the focus is not on the campaign but on the gameplay, so don't expect much from the story. One thing I do like is how the main characters of the game interact and talk to you depending on which faction you're playing as. It's a nice touch, however you put it. I can say that the campaign can be fairly challenging your first time around. Enemies can often send powerful units and even experimentals (We'll get to those later) charging at your base without giving you much time to react. This is fun, but can often slow the pace of the game down to a snail's speed if you want to prepare accordingly before the event takes place. I said before that the focus is on gameplay, and even the game agrees with me. When you fail a mission, you have the option of skipping to the next one to see what onslaught awaits you there. Very nice, considering RTS games are not known for their story. The characters are each fairly memorable, but none of them ever seem to have much personality. (Although, I'm not entirely convinced that Fletcher isn't Ben Stiller) It's a futuristic army vs. bigger army simulator, and that's all it wants to be. Frankly, that's all I need it to be.

On to gameplay. I thought it couldn't be done, but somehow SC:FA made it's gameplay even simpler than Dawn of War. Starting with the fact that there are no counters. Most tier II units can destroy tier I units, most tier III units can destroy tier II units, and experimentals decimate everything in their path. Speaking of experimental units, I don't believe I've told you about them yet. Experimentals are a faction's endgame units. They are the biggest and meanest superweapons out there, each more powerful than the next. Heck, there's even one that drops a mega-nuke. Did you know mega-nukes were a thing? Neither did I. In SC:FA, there is no lack of awe-inspiring combat. Seeing massive armies clash on the field of battle sounds epic, doesn't it? Well, how dare you even question the fact that it is so totally unbelievably epic. Shame on you. The resource management is quite unique, and something that I have never seen in a game like this before. Put simply, you have resource intake and resource storage for two primary resources: Mass and Power. The former being your source of unit and structure production, and the latter being to power things like a unit's special ability, or base defenses. While you can construct power generators willy-nilly all over the place, take caution as the bigger generators may provide more power, but they are also incredibly volatile and can wipe out weaker structures in the blink of an eye if they are ever destroyed. Mass on the other hand can only be acquired from certain points which you can build Mass Extractors on. Most of these are scattered about the battlefield, so protecting them may be a pain. Let's say you now have a good intake of Mass and Power and are ready to build some units. Well, each unit or structure will drain you of a certain amount of Mass and Power, the more powerful units often devouring hundreds of each resource. However, if your Mass and Power intake is more than the unit needs, you should be in safe ground and the unit will be produced as normal. If you run out of Mass or Power storage when the unit's drainage is bigger than your Mass or Power intake, your production will slow to something akin to the Heavy spinning up the Brass Beast while being hit by Natascha. Take note that Power has no impact on this, but will disable things like shields if it runs out. I hope at least some of that made sense to you.

Talking graphics, the game doesn't boast anything too great, but looking at the attention to detail on some of the units leaves me feeling impressed.

The soundtrack is meh. That's all I can say. None of the songs are too memorable, at least as far as I can recall. You won't find any Baba Yetu in here, that's for sure.

The multiplayer is dead. But not really. Although there are multiple services that have restored Forged Alliance's multiplayer on their own servers, Rock Paper Shotgun stated that this game is best played with your friends against AI. I don't blame them, because what better parter to help obliterate armies of uncountable size than your best friend?

TL;DR: Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is excellent at what it does, and doesn't try to be something it's not. I give huge props to this game and it's devs for making it, and may future RTS titles learn from this game for years to come.

You can play the full battle power plan and upgrade to 3 levels building... as units.
There is so much to build like buildings, shields, units, and upgrading them is extra job.
The maps are freaking huge and somethings to big so you can get a cofe when you send some units to your enemies.
You need a freaking manual or somebody to explain what to do with a lot of stuff because this is nog a basic RTS game like Red Alert 2.

I have only two complaints. First, don't forget that Supreme Commander was released in 2007. The graphics and gameplay are still immersive, but unfortunately it is not programmed with modern hardware in mind. So while it runs perfectly fine, it is not configured to run on multicore processors and does not benefit from advanced hardware, which can lead to performance issues with thousands of units at once.

The second complaint (a facetious one) is that the commercial and critical success of this game provoked a horrible, dumbed down sequel (Supreme Commander 2).

Ahhhh, Supreme Commander, specifically Forged Alliance. I grew up on several games, this being one of them. It is definitely one of the greatest RTS‚Äôs I have ever seen. Basically, there are two ways one can play this game, rushing or turtling. But when you add that a wide variety of maps, factions, units, tech trees, and complex AI‚Äôs that break your face in with ARMIES UPON ARMIES OF T1 TANKS!?!? It gets pretty darn fun. Graphics are amazing for a game released in 2007, the units mix well with the terrain, and the overlay is perfect. Mechanics are pretty perfect, everything is pretty balanced, and there are plenty of options for stuff in the custom lobby.

Price is perfect, the expansion Forged Alliance is a must get, and it is the TRUE sequel to SupCom, not SupCom 2 made by Square Enix.

A great recommendation, the learning curve may be a slight bit steep, but this game is a must-have for anybody starting an adventure into RTS Games.

Look around, try every button and you will find this game has a lot of good mechanics and features you don't see in a lot of games.

The game engine, however, is slightly limited and if you set the total unit cap too high in games with more than 3-4 players it [b]will[/b] slow down. 75%, 50% or even 20% game speed is common for games of decent size. There's fewer people who have an issue with this than people who don't, but it's worth keeping in mind when you buy the game. To play with 3000 units on the same map you will have to make compromises.

The story is great though, and combined with a multiplayer that will have you playing every map twice or more it would have been worth buying for many times more than what it costs on Steam on full price.

A couple days ago, I spotted this on steam and decided to give it a try, see what I would have gotten had I chose this game instead.

Before I go on, let me explain that I have always loved RTS games. DoW, AoE, Stronghold, C&C, etc. So when I saw this game and the massively positive reviews for it, I bought it straight away! It looked awesome, whole armies crushing your enemies underfoot, whats not to like?

The game worked for me,   only one crash while I was in the tutorial. So no problem there.

The problem was, well, the mechanics. I am used to a minimap, when I play againest my competitive friends, the minimap is needed for survival. The tutorial pointed out pretty quick that my screen IS my minimap. Great.

Not only did I keep forgetting about it, its also extremely awkward to use. I kept playing without using it, making it seem to me that I was alone, when in fact there was a huge battle going on around me, and I couldnt see it.

Secondly, there is a STEEP learning curve. The Controls take way too long to learn and master. I consider myself atleast competent when it comes to RTS's, I can normally figure out the controls in a game or two. 

With this game? Well, you may notice that I only have TWO hours played on it, and also that I've returned it. 

Well, thats because these games take HOURS to play. You can't bang out one game in a hour. Heck no. You have to be willing to SIT THERE and WAIT. Wait for your eco to boost up, wait for your buildings to build, wait for your units to be created. 

Each unit has around a 7-10 second timer. Even the weak units. Yes it has a HUGE pop cap of up to 1000, which is awesome. But for one thing.

I can't get any resources. The game wont give you ANYTHING starting out, and resources come in at a TRICKLE. For my first skirmish game after the tutorial, I tried setting it on huge resources or whatever, and it does not have any. You are stuck with the regular resources, which let me tell you, are gone faster then ice placed in the middle of the sahara desert.


I had to use CHEATS. CHEATS. To explore the mechanics of the game more fully. 

I am not one of those people who can sit down for 4-5 hours on ONE game.  This game is for you if you like slow paced afternoon-length games. If you cant invest the time and effort it takes to play this game, dont buy it. 


I spent two hours with this game. Only played ONE game. And I couldnt even finish it because it got boring using the cheats since it took to long trying to play the game with normal resources and setup.


Poor economy, poor unit build time, confusing map interface,  extremely long length game battles without the resources to easily get said long games off the ground effectively, this is a MASSIVE dissapointment to me.


Buy if your a HARDCORE RTS player who can spend hours in ONE GAME. 

If you like RTS' but dont want to invest hours in a single match, or are new to the genre on a whole, or just a casual gamer, SKIP. 


When I think of the people who might like this game, I think of a old man in his mid 70s.  It requires ALOT of patience. Kudos to anyone who can sit through it, I sure as h*ll cant.


Its like you build a beautiful mansion, but then don't install plumbing or power, and only use one room out of the whole mansion.

This one may look better but what I liked about the old TA was the lack of micro management which can plague RTS games.  I liked that you could just cue up a few hundred units in each factory and get straight to the fighting, sure you had to manage resources but it was generally not a primary focus of game play and I found though you couldnt ignore it you wouldn't be spending most of your time focusing on it. 

For me I was hoping for a bit of that same element here in this one but fo me it's good but not as good.  There is somewhat of formula in this one to get started and if you don't follow it (particularly early in a skirmish game) you will constantly be struggling to get on top of your resources.
Some people may love that but not me

The economy is identical to Total Annihalation; mass and energy are the only resources you need, the armoured command unit (ACU) is as ever the engine by which you drive your war machine, and units now come in four distinct flavours: tech 1, tech 2, tech 3 and experi(mental) on land, sea and by air.

The economy is really difficult to get a handle on, but once you get used to it, start to see how it all fits together, and then start implementing those newfound skills, it feels immensely rewarding. It also blows balls when a bomber takes out one power generator that's connected to an entire grid of power generators and your entire base goes black, just before a different enemy sends in an experimental unit to wreak havok. But those are also the kind of moments in the game that makes it special. There's something oddly amazing about playing defense, but not so much in terms of using units, but rather resource management to make sure your sheild generators don't drop. 

It feels like a strangely realistic version of over the top sci-fi warfare. On the one hand, you can just spam light units like the Ruskies, or you can focus on developing base defense and researching up to higher-tech units. The crazy thing is that this game doesn't really focus on a ""rock-papers-scissors"" balancing form, as even if one player has tons of low level units, if an opposing player brings in two experimentals, the other player is essentially screwed.

If you like RTS games like Starcraft, Age of Empires or Rise of Nations, this is along those lines, but with some huge differences that make it unique and absolutely PHENOMENAL. The economy and production is different and takes some getting used to, but adds much more depth and strategy than you get with other games (even though there are only 2 resources!). It's not all about micro and having a zillion APM like Starcraft, but micro still matters and can mean the difference in a match. Cool units, well balanced.

The campaign is no better or worse than you'd get in other games, but I have always preferred skirmish matches in any game. 

You may find the AI is stupid (isn't it in basically all games?) or too difficult, or that there is no acceptable medium between the hard and cheating AI. You should go to forged alliance forever (faforever.com, download the lobby) for the multiplayer, maps, mods and improvements, which help fix this and give you exactly the challenge you want and tons of other cool stuff. (I regret not doing this sooner!)

Why has does no other strategy game let you so easily zoom out exactly as far as you want?!!!! I never realized how awesome this feature is until I played this game. I can no longer be satisfied playing other games because you can't do this. 

Forged Alliance was revolutionary. Even with outdated graphics, I love this game. I haven't played Supreme Commander 2 because based on reviews it went more towards the typical, above mentioned RTS games, and the differences between them and Forged Alliance are what make this game BETTER. It is addicting. You will not regret the $15.

The game offers many unique and cool features for RTS players, who will be in awe at what they have at their disposal to throw at the enemy, AND use to control their massive land armies, navies, and air fleets. The game will give you the ability to ferry units, back and forth. You can set a rally point for your factories on the rally beacon, and have the transports continously transport reinforcements to the front, allowing you to re-allocate your attention to something else. Along with being able to have an efficient transportation system, and basically less of a headache to transport armies to the front. 

You'll also will be enjoying the beautiful destruction the game will provide for you, the AI will pump out armies usually the same order, but will combine all three forces of air, land, and naval. This may result you in pulling your hair out and getting frustrated as your small patrols are no match for the endless swarms of the Hard AI. However, the AI is very easy to beat once getting  the hang of the game, and pumping out your own swarms, or building experimentals and tier 3 units to combat the AI's late game units. Which can easily change the tide of battle into your favor, and keep your interests on the map secured. 

If you don't think land units are your most viable option at the moment, as you need them somewhere else but need to hold a position. Don't be afraid to send a few engineers to set up breastworks and turrets, along with artillery to back them up and your troops. Devastating fire power can also be not delivered via barrel, but through your air squadrons carrying nuclear ordnance to the enemy's main factories, or his commander himself.

Nonetheless, there is ALOT more the game has for you to utilize, and it will give you an enjoyable experience of the RTS genre, and again explosions.",1418769624,1432168412,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

And by building i mean i took my time, i built formidable bases. Then built me an army and or fleet, to take the first objective, but before taking that i built more armies and or fleets, so i had some left over for when the map expanded. You do not want to get caught without those forces when the final and biggest enemy base finally appears on your map. 

You must take your time and you must fortify your whole base, lack of proper defenses will have the enemy dropship troops onto your doorstep and blow your infra structure to smithereens. Rushing will lead to you being overwhelmed by the forces the enemy had stockpiled. You'll know what i mean once 4 experimentals are marching towards your base and you don't have anything to stop them with. 

The story isn't much, just a little something to hang the action onto, but it's okay.  Visiually it does what is neccesary, allowing vast armies to clash and lovely explosions to cover the field from left to right. I get a blast from seeing nukes going off over the enemies productions centers. 

Special mention should be made of the AI, while not genius level. It did target my radar early on so its attacks would  be more of a surprise, line of sight then being the criteria for a lot of units to shoot despite their range. And it took particular offense to my building the experimental building that would have ended my economic needs. It got bombed conventionally twice as i was building it and actually launched a nuke at it for attempt number three.

Firstly the fact the game only uses 1 thread of 1 CPU in your system and as a result as the game goes on it piles where your units are where theirs are, shell trajectorys the AI tactics and so on and so forth into 1 thread so it bottlenecks after a period which in turn later on will slow the game down to every game second takes 3 real seconds, you can get the saurion ai patch to fix this somewhat.

Unit AI more specifically YOUR unit AI, you spend the game not fighting the enemy but fighting your units as ground units will happily try and shell the tank that is behind a hill that they cant hit due to said hill in the way whilst being cleaned up by enemy tanks that have decided to come around the hill until they have line of sight, air units that just sit on the ground and when an enemy plane comes into range will just pick up and land somewhere else instead of engaging, usually when they take they are then destroyed by any fighters the enemy choose to bring with them.  Sea units are just like tanks and will try and shell things that are out of sight.

The commander and anyother building unit can build/capture at range however they like to drive right up to your blueprint or enemy structure before attempting to build or capture, sometimes circling the object until they have found a direction they prefer to face.  Build time is important and building quick is important so any seconds you can save is great but when your commander or engineers fuss about getting into position its very frustrating.

Super units are a great thing to build the hardship of your labours, of getting a good economy going to support building such a massive thing, the satisfaction of being able to survive this long to have built such a device and of corse the joy when it is finally complete and the sense of power that runs through you sends a chill up your spine....... but its short lived.  Super units are just as dumb as everything else in your arsenal if not worse i built a monkey lord from the cybran team and sent him off on his merry down the map just as the enemy team (aion) sent up their sacred assualt bot, now the monkey lord has a sweeping red laser which has a greater range than the laser on the assault bot so i though yeeeessss this should not be a problem and promptly told him to attack their assault bot only for him to walk straight by the bot whilst targeting tech 1 tanks of his own choosing stop when he had walked past it out of range of his laser and turn to try and correct this, obviously this was to late cause as soon as he got in range the assault bot had hit him with his laser during the pass and exploded as he stopped then the assault bot promptly cleaned up my base.

Obviosly this game has been out a while so this review comes late but its just a warning to any people looking at getting this for the first time be prepared to be frustrated beyond belief at controlling one of the dumbest AI's ever in a strategy game, i cant be bothered to even try and defend this.",1428662729,1428662729,False,39,11,0.444254130125045776,11,True,False,False

Supreme Commander Forged Alliance starts where the first Supreme Commander ended campaign wise, and sadly just like the original there is no point in paying attention to the story of the game as it is shallow and expectable. The true test of a strategy game is not its story, but its gameplay, and Supreme Commander Forged Alliance more than delivers. The amount of units in every faction from tech one to experimental can actually be overwhelming; surprisingly every unit in the game has its own unique stats and textures that will leave you in awe for hours on. A staple of Supreme Commander is the large scale 1,000 unit battles, and while fun to command such large forces the amount of micro-management is necessary but annoying. A major success Supreme Commander Forged Alliance presents is the balanced multiplayer; all 4 factions (UEF, Aeon, Cybran, and Seraphim) require unique playstyles to utilize the faction's strengths and minimize the faction's weaknesses.
 
First off there is the UEF which are the jack of all trades, but master of none faction. The UEF do however have higher HP than other units, and arguably the strongest tier 1 in the game.

The Cybran Nation's units are the least expensive to construct compared to the other factions' and they have the lowest HP. Their advantages lie in technologies that disrupt enemies. For instance, they have assault bots at tech 1 to disrupt an enemy's early expansion, their tech 3 aircraft have integrated stealth technology, when their Siege Assault Bots are destroyed their cores detonate powerfully releasing an EMP burst that disrupts enemy units, and they have the only mobile stealth field system. This even extends to their experimental units: The Monkeylord is the only experimental unit with a stealth capability. These attributes give the Cybran Nation a wide array of kill strategies.

Aeon units are the most effective in an even fight between equivalent units. Their HP, construction costs, speed and abilities are average, but their weapons are particularly effective. For instance, their tech 2 tanks do more DPS, their tech 3 bombers drop smartbombs that track their targets, and their tech 3 artillery does not stop to deploy stabilizers in order to fire, but also lets them have very good accuracy. The trajectories of their weapons often give them the best effective DPS and initial shot damage.The Aeon also have the best shields after the Seraphim but the highest shield density as the seraphim shields have a very large radius. Their T2 mobile shield generators have the highest shield points. This allows for a task force to be protected whilst engaging the enemy. The Aeon is widely considered to have the best navy. Aeon T1 Light Tanks: Auroras are amphibious giving the Aeon an early naval advantage, Aeon mobile shield generators are also amphibious to support the navy, and Aeon naval units are nearly all more hardy and powerful than the other factions' naval units. They also have the only submersible battleship.

Generally speaking, the Seraphim units are a combination of the UEF and the Aeon--they have a mixture of multi-purpose units and specialized units. Their units usually have the second highest HP and construction costs. Like the Aeon, a few of these units can hover, thereby avoiding the danger of torpedoes and having the advantage of being able to travel across water. In terms of equivalent units, the Seraphim carry units with high HP, high construction costs, and appreciable weapon damage and ROF. They excel in terms of land and naval units (the author can confirm killing a UEF destroyer using 5 T1 submarines without losing a single submarine), but have average air units. If the UEF/Cybran have the best land units, and if the Aeon have the best air units, the Seraphim follows by a close second on both of these. The most obvious advantage the Seraphim holds is their shields. The Seraphim is the only faction to have a T3 Mobile Shield Generator: Athanah, and both Seraphim stationary shield generators have more health and a larger radius, but at a higher cost. The Seraphim's navy in some cases exceeds that of the Aeon due to the fact that they have a T3 submarine hunter which can be used to destroy any submerged unit and has advanced torpedo defences, T3 mobile shield generators can protect a naval group easily due to their high shield points and radius. The T3 battleship is a mobile strategic missile launcher allowing for sneak attacks from different locations. The Seraphim's T2 destroyer is submersible allowing it to act as a T2 submarine as its torpedoes and torpedo defences are superior to any other factions T2 destroyers. An extension of the Seraphim navy is their naval defences which are equipped with torpedo defences which allows them to outlast any equivalent turret from the other factions apart from the Cybran's T3 submerged torpedo turret. The Seraphim Anti-Air turrets have been considered to be the worst around, but a T2 cruiser: Ithalua, having tremendous DPS for air units, is almost a compensation for this. From an aesthetic standpoint, the Seraphim take an even more extreme approach to unit design than the Aeon, especially considering their assymetrical designs. Seraphim units are generally smoother and more elegant in appearance, with few jagged angles. Their units sport a chrome-like finish, adding to the alien appearance. Like the Aeon, the Seraphim employ unusual and alien weaponry, including the Heavy Quarnon Cannon, the Uall Cavitation Torpedo, and the Olaris AA Artillery Cannon.

Overrall Supreme Commander Forged Alliance is one of the best strategy games of all time, and will always be a benchmark in the strategy genre. The game is unique, interesting, challenging, great gameplay, and a small, but active online community to have fun with.

The only drawback to Supreme Commander Forged Alliance is its learning curve. The game takes a few hours to learn, but that is expected of a comprehensive strategy game such as Supreme Commander Forged Alliance.

When I bought it here alongside FA, I was pleasantly surprised, it was far better than what I remembered it as, the unit count is astonishing, and the physics incredible. The very fact that it was possible for a nuclear missile to be stopped by a plane flying into it by accident and could change the tide of a match blew my mind (in more ways than one, my ACU was killed by the blast).  As well as the realistic and unique physics, the experimental units of this game (incredibly expensive yet powerful units) seem to incite fear in every mans heart when they appear on your radar, especially if you were expecting to be attacked from a completely different angle of your base, with all your defences stacked right in that one spot, helpless to prevent your destruction.
 The scale of the game is stunning- especially for a game made in 2007, with the camera able to pan the whole way from a sort of global view right down to the trees littering the landscape, units can leave behind treadmarks and ripples in their wake when on the move, or burnt out shells when they are stopped permanently.  A further detail that interests me about this game is that the burnt out shells can be harvested for resources - it makes winning each little skirmish all the more satisfying as you can melt down your opponents losses and use them to make more units of your own. 

    I would recommend this game if you enjoy admiring the full scale of war and strategy, or just want to watch the world burn from the wrath of your armies.

Along with balance changes and new units, it's like a whole new game, rather than an expansion. My favorite part of this game is how it offers a mesmerising view of a futuristic battlefield. How it allows you to zoom up, watch individual parts of an unit move and fire true projectiles. That might not seem to be not that special, but the level of amusement I get when I see projectiles hit things they're not supposed to hit is goofy high. I can spend hours zoomed in just to watch the animations of units, even small things like energy storage growing taller as more energy is stored, and how engineers tilt their wheels to float on the water. I wish every game had strategic zoom like this game, with such polished visuals. 

The user interface is still rather basic, but much improved over the original, giving you much more space to see the battlefield. It requires 3rd party add-ons (UI mods) to allow things such as keybind remapping, to display health bars all the time, managing templates easier, and upgrade helpers. I highly recommend at least getting GAZ_UI (I used version 6.1). I had to adjust my build order with the changes that took place, such as starting with a factory first. It wasn't until FA that I seriously started to look at deciphering all the + and - numbers on everything, and learning how to balance energy income with mass income, depending on what I wanted to build. A lot of reading tooltips, looking at unit stats in the unit database web page, and a bit of math helped me out, which is akin to doing spreadsheets. 

This game seems to love Intel processors, or those with great ""single-thread"" performance. Playing on a laptop or AMD CPU will result in some slow-mo action before the end. Even if you have a good CPU, playing in a game with another with a slow CPU can make it agonizingly slow for you, especially if you're used to it being faster. The game doesn't run smoothly at full speed if there's someone else in your game with a poor or unreliable connection as well. I felt like I couldn't play big 8 player games with air battles and 1000 unit cap, until I got my PC upgraded (from AMD X3 720 to i2600k). 

The gameplay itself is a handful. It's a challenge to multi-task. The objective is simple, to destroy the enemy commander, but achieving it is another story. You should manage to progress your economy, never settling with a certain amount as ""enough"", and considering how there's 3 tech levels of it and the hugeness of how maps are, you quickly find out how difficult it is to keep track of anything spread out. Staying compact will allow you to progress through tech at a manageable pace, but this is not an ideal way to achieve victory. Until you get used to things, to the point they become subconscious actions, your strategies will be extremely limited. I resorted to gambling with basic strategies, such as building up dozens of tanks, outnumbering the enemy, and using an upgraded commander to spearhead the assault, looking to surround the enemy commander. At first it was successful, but as maps get bigger and enemy teams get more members, this becomes less effective. Using a dozen tech 2 bombers or gunships to just simply fly in and bomb the enemy commander was a gamble that was easily countered by a shield and a few flak units. Once I got the hang of quickly upgrade my mass, I tried getting out an experimental as quickly as possible, but this strat could be beaten by a zerg rush. Sneaking a T3 commander with a transport as soon as possible was a huge gamble, but seemingly was the only strat that worked if I could land it where I wanted, without endless practice in other parts of the game. 

Multiplayer is still barely alive. I was able to register my product serial on Steam to play there, but a competing 3rd party lobby seems to be sucking players away with its advertising. If you choose to play multiplayer on that other lobby, ""FAF"", I hope you have thick skin and have great luck! I'd describe it as being an active volcano. Be extra cautious and watch out for eruptions. Go in with low expectations, else you may be disappointed, as their advertisements are clearly biased. They lose as many users as they get new ones, due to how toxic and unwelcoming they can be to some, especially those who go in expecting too much. Stick it out and endure the frustration and you'll be able to play one of the most noteworthy RTS games with some actual players. 

After playing this, I haven't found another RTS that has impressed me enough. SupCom2 was okay for a short while, fixing some issues I had with Forged Alliance, but was not close to being a FA killer, since it just didn't have the same scale and felt cheapened overall, such as with the cheesy sound effects (ex. commander explosion) and Aeon unit names that sounded cheap and unoriginal.

Visual Arts : Lacking, To say the least, No personality in here, Can not tell the difference between one unit to another, Beside their size change that is noticable and experimental units that actually do look different from each other.
Map terrain looks extremely generic, Nothing really stands out there.

Voice Acting : Bad, You are better with subtitles only.
SoundFX : Bad, The amount of bass there is for almost every sound is huge, And it's mostly just generic explosion sounds.
Music : Unnoticeable.

Multiplayer: The community seems to be trying to survive , with FAF lobby mode included.

This game can have a steep learning curve, and campaign missions may well take you two hours to complete if you go carefully, or twice that if you go full defensive on the hardest difficulty setting, but this just means that there's actually meaning to good base design, and it is incredibly satisfying to build up an impenetrable fortress then create an army that will flatten your opponent... hopefully. Then there's also the option of building so many nuclear launch facilities that you can overwhelm your enemy's missile defense systems and drown them in nuclear fire (for reference, nukes in this game are just about the hardest to obtain in any game i've found, but they're also the most visually spectacular and you actually have cause to fear them)

There is a good variety of options for the skirmish mode, you can put yourself in a cagefight with a trio of AI opponents that cheat just for added difficulty, you can customise some major gamemode settings such as completely disallowing certain units or tech-levels, or you can increase the rate at which everyone gathers resources to speed the game up a bit.

The graphics are very nice, especially considering the number if units you will have running around the map at any given time. the textures don't look that great if you were to zoom all the way in, but if you do that you'll zoom out again to find that OH GOD THE CYBRAN HAD A BUNCH OF STEALTHED MONKEYLORDS OUTSIDE MY BASE AND THEY'RE TRAMPLING MY REACTORS!

However, the place this game really outshines anything else i've played is its interface. you can customise so easily what the map shows you in terms of the range of your anti-air, anti ground, indirect fire, etc, your sonar, radar, omnisensor ranges... it offers you so much information but if you're finding it overwhelming you can just switch it all of with about two clicks.
Unit control is so good in this game, in terms of automation. you can very reasonably set up a factory to produce infinite of a set of units, have air transports pick them up from your base, and airdrop into a different part of the map with no input from the player. this makes managing hundreds (or, with mods, thousands) of units so much eaiser, leaving you to direct your army, navy and airforce, and watch the explosions.",1419983871,1419983871,True,35,3,0.744613945484161377,0,True,False,False

Mainly carried by its massive amount of units (land, naval and air) you can build, the real strategy involved into maps and economy and the fact that the commander (you) is personalised into a badass mecha type giant robot.

Lots of focus in economy (only 2 factors) managment.
There's amount of POWER and amount of MASS you colect every second.
Mass is finite, this means theres not a lot of options to get this one, up until a point of the game.
Power is almost infinite it only depends of the structures you build.

And a plus is the multiplayer, there's a lot of it going on and really nice people willing to help a noob to learn how to play this fast paced, brain melting strategic game.

I love the different factions and all the different units! 

The one thing that was confusing at first was how you gain resources... Instead of the typical ""build resource building near resource and wait for units to bring in resources"" it's more like ""build resource building (mass extracter on mass areas and energy generators anywhere) and get instant satisfation"".

Also how it manages resources... You can build things when you have no resources in storage... It'll just be A LOT slower... :)

You can also put more engineers to what ever you're building to help speed up the process... Wish all RTS games would do this... :P

This game has spoiled me as well... Instead of relying on the mini map for aerial view, just scroll all the way out... Love that... I think it's super intuitive...

Oh! And you can dodge missiles!!! :P

One thing I didn't like is the ai is so-so. Some ai are really easy to beat, others are impossible (so far... I have room for improvement... :P), and still others are hard at first but then you destroy enough units and it's like they quit! Super annoying(mind you, this is without a mod)...

The mechanics are impeccable, gameplay is tight, and the single-player doesn't disappoint too much. The concept of focused engineering and streaming economies is very cool, and I put many, many hours into this game. 

Be warned that there is a learning curve if you have played other RTS games before, but the tutorial section does a good job of explaining the basics. The single-player campaign is a very good way to learn the basics, as the deck isn't really stacked that badly against the users. That said, you can amp up the challenge in Skirmish matches by picking AI templates that can cheat (which is also an amazing feature)

It being 2014, the graphics now look a little dated (especially textures) but it still remains one of the best-looking RTS games of its time, and still manages to look pretty good. The user interface manages to be very comprehensive out of the box, but can be made more minimal if needed. The UI also presents more features (visibility, command, etc) than I have seen in other RTS franchises. I am seriously never going back to Starcraft!

The downside to all these features is the complexity (and the learning curve mentioned above) but those are all quite easily manageable.

Zoom
The strategic zoom alone is multiple steps ahead of other RTS's which seems insignificant but theres really no going back...

Tech and Research
As with most RTS style games there are technology levels (3 with an experimental level as number 4) with multiple races (4 in this game), then there is an economy stucture based on Mass (harder to aquire) and Energy (easier to build).

Units/Maps
All units (aside from Commanders) are robotic and large in size which helps to accomodate for the large maps. They range from 80km by 80km to 5km by 5km. Unit limits are adjustible but can go up to 1000 without mods

Combat types
Forms of direct combat range from space with satelites (but only ground fire with them), land combat, naval combat (including subermrines) and air combat. commanders are also capable of teleporting to destinations.

Mods etc
The game comes with some mods built in that you can turn on or off as you please. On top of this there is a strong modding community which has made many types of mods and mappacks for the game

Servers
The game has three online platforms to play on GPG been the original (they have run out of money and no longer exist) steam has a platform to play off and hosts the game as it was meant to be, FAF also are a player supported platform that is the largest in use with players across world using it (it is not all originall).

Overall
A very fun game with a strong player community (enough so that they have set up a player supported platform through donations to play on).

This game has EVERYTHING I ever wanted to do in an RTS on such a massive scale. The expansion is standalone and has some nice upgrades compared to the first game, but I think the first Supreme Commander is still worth it. It's an experience all of its own.

If you are wondering on what to choose from this version from Supreme comander 2, choose this one, it is far better than Supreme Comader 2. However, take these into consideration...

Pros:
-Intense scenes of battle and tons of infantry options (tanks, ships, air and uprgrades)
-more based on conquest over important areas rather than just having more territory
-graphics are pretty damn awesome for this type of game
-Custom maps and mod support
-Stratigically hard and makes you think about your next move
-never gets old...

Cons:
-Hard to grasp for new players (very nice and easy tut in-game though)
-Resource gathering is a little bit harder than the original game
-Long wars that seem to never have an end (my record, 4 hours of non-stop playing, which isnt that bad)
-Can be little crazy at times
-no multiplayer with random people (you will have to find a friend to play with because there just isnt anyone on)

Overall, its a kick ass game and i love it. Nukes, secret bases and stratigic base installments are key to success, while also trying to maintain a good economy (i.e. mass and energy plants to fuel your army).

Sure, when I first started, I had no clue what to do, but as with every other game, it's a challenge, an adventure, and by god is this game one giant adventure filled with massive armies clashing and nukes exloding left and right. Heck, this game has more explosions than a Michael Bay film. The four, when I say four I really mean 3+1, tech levels in this game need to be brought out at pinpoint moments in the game, if not, you'll just lose since your enemy has more T1 Light Assault Bots than you even though you have five T2 tanks. The best part about this is that everything has been moved to the community since GPG basically died off after SupCom 2. Forged Alliance Forever is the greatest community driven project I have ever seen in my entire life. Mods after mods after mods and a matchmaking system that ACTUALLY WORKS.
Summary of Forged Alliance Forever: Tired of playing ranked matches and losing every single time? Find a lobby with a huge load of mods (or create your own) and fight people in massive wars with stupid, stupid amounts of resources. Tired of THAT? Play the original Forged Alliance Campaign with the same mods! Heck, Forged Alliance Forever even includes the original SupCom campaign (You have to own SupCom 1 first obviously) but with the same improvements, unit additions, improvements and mods that are run and can be run on Forged Alliance forever.

Final Verdict: This has been my most favourite Real-Time-Strategy in the world. Not even Planetary Annihilation can compare to this. Not enough depth I feel. Thus, this game gets a full 10/10 from me. Seriously, if you haven't bought this and downloaded FAF yet, DO IT NOW OR I WILL HATE YOU.

I owned the game for nearly 3 months before actually playing playing it. (You know how it is.) Never heard of Supreme Commander or the series and passed it off as a generic knock off from Command and Conquer. WOW I WAS WRONG. SC and SC: FA are 2 of the most underrated RTS games I have ever had the privledge of playing. The progressive scaling of units and map size where hundreds of units engage in epic land, air, and sea warfare is something very few RTS games get right. NIce blend between theoretical technology and pre existing war machines with armaments that can be found in armed forces around the world.  But what impresses me the most is how smooth the games run, even when 2000 units are ""in play."" The interface is very polished and easy to navigate. Simply scorlling the mouse wheel immediately zooms into full view of the map where units are displayed by icons instead of smaller models, allowing for fluid macro play even when your 3 bases are scattered across the map. Has all the elements that one would want in an RTS which include but are not limited to:

4 playable factions. All with their own unique flavor and yet are still balanced.
4 Tier(s) of technology and units that are EPIC when engaged in combat. 
A challenging campaign with 8 missions that can last between 1 and 5 hours. (5 if you're like me and enjoy building more automated base defenses.  
Incredibly fluid gameplay that is challenging and rewarding.
And finally it is quality mental exercise when you've got 10 macro'd unit groups and several dozen unit production buildings gaurding your commander against endless waves of enemy units that often have an unfair advantage. 

If you're a true pc game elitist and you enjoy games of strategy that are aesethically pleasing then definitely grab SC and SC: FA next time you get a chance. 

PS - could care less about any grammar or spelling oversights. (Its a steam review that no one will read anyways.)

I'm not sure I can express how much fun it is to play Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, but I'll try anyway. I like to take my time when playing, just to make sure I have enough fire power to overwhelm my enemies, even when I'm challenging my friends, but they make me work for it so it's a fun experience overall.

If you've got the specs to run the game, I guarantee that you will love playing it for hours everyday. I know I do and even though you go through the same thing every time when going through campaign, it's still fun and makes great practice to further develop your skills. I've played this game for years and it never fails to curb my boredom. In the beginning of the campaign, you choose the level of difficulty: Easy, Medium or Hard (Do not choose hard if your just starting out, you will get owned within the first 30 minutes of starting the campaign.) When it's time, you'll choose your faction: UEF, Aeon or Cybran. Just remember that each faction has a particular strength that the other factions either can't do or do better, but also remember that you can repeat the campaign as many times as you want and you can play throught it with all 3 factions.

You can even choose to skirmish your friends or Computer AI's or both and with the AI's having different levels of skill, you'll probably have your work cut out for you. If you dare choose one of the hard difficulties, let's see if you can adapt when the AI is sending experimentals your way every few minutes among the other possible waves of units. My advice, build up a strong defense and make sure you can hold the line long enough to turn the tide.

There is also multiplayer for anyone who just wants to challenge their friends to an all out fight or you can choose to fight in teams. Let's see if any of you have what it takes to reign supreme, but no matter how it ends, you'll all have fun doing it.

Well I agree but there are a couple of things that still make the original TA a better game. For starters SupCom takes a LONG time to get a base up and running at maximum efficiency with multiple factories churning out tanks and bots, and the problem is that the AI immediately begins attacking you fom the start so unless you repel the first rush properly and you are able to repel each subsequent attack on your position, because by the time you have dealt with the first the second is often already on the way, then you are screwed. 

The maps are much larger which makes for more epic combat and I must say this is a good thing. You can play with more than 4 players on one map as opposed to TA and that is also good. There are three tech levels instead of two and the ability to customize your commander unit which is also pretty cool but beware that upgrading takes much MUCH more ressources, easily exponential amounts which means if your ressources infrastructures are not ready your facotories will simply stop producing. This is what I had the most trouble with in this game whereas in TA I always got the upper hand on the ressource situation I have a very difficult time maintaining my production in this game because of how expensive good units are. Producing masses of tech one level units is simplky not worht it because a tech two unit can easily outmatch upwards of a dozen tech one units and so on for a tech three unit. 

Furthermore on the ressource issue, the AI methodically targets your ressource infrastucture before even targetting defensive turrets at times which simply adds to the trouble of collecting enough ressources to maintain production. This is not a complaint in itself just somkething that adds to my troubles with the game.

All in all this game is very good though if you liked TA just don't expect it to be a revamped reworked version of the 1997 classic because this game has a flavour all of its own. Epic battles await and Nukes are awesome in this game.

You can set a cap of 8000 units on the battlefield, so if you have a 1v1, each player can have 4000 units. FOUR-F******-THOUSAND. At 8 players (teams don't have to be fair) each player has a thousand troops. I have seen people compare this game to Starcraft with 200 units at the max per player. Some people like the extreme tactics that game has, this game has them too, except on a bigger scale. Let me show you a quick comparison

Airdrops: 
Starcaft: Drop 16 marines in 2 medivacs.
Supreme Commader: Drop 20 units in 1 transport.
Armies
Starcraft: A marine/marauder deathball slaughtering zerglings or a zealot rush
Supreme Commander: A 300 strong army supported by experimentals holds off the main force, as battleships and carriers support the army, then on the over side of the map 5 nuclear subs nuke the enemy base as an airdrop composed of 150 units flanks the main force. (And that is on a 1000 units per team)
Nukes: (I know that it's only a lesser part of Starcraft, but it is quite big in the end game of Supreme Commander)
Starcraft: A Nuke won't destroy the main base building, it's mainly for clearing armies or finishing off bases
Supreme Commander: When you usually send nukes, you send 5 or more. Depending on nuke defences the attack might fail but when it hits, it hits. A nuke will wipe a base.
Defence
Starcraft: SC is about the offensive and manuevering, you defend to hold the army off as a bigger force flanks.
Supreme Commander: If you have ever played Halo Reach, on the desert mission where you need to destroy the AA towers, at the end there is a massive Spire. Imagine that but around the spire there is about 50 gatling guns and AA turrets. Also (most games don't have this) you CAN build WALLS. (I know it's amazing)

While I personally like this feature of this game, some peope disagree. There are NO hard counters. (Well yes, the tech 2  UEF flak turret tank will easily  wipe out tech 2 planes and even take on tech 3 planes. And yes, the experimentals are basically hard counters for everything they can target, and the air vs air planes will SLAUGHTER EVERYONE WHO FLIES.) But mostly a tech 3 robot will not have an advantage over a tech 3 tank or vise verca.  And although all the factions look different and have different units, they are mostly the same. The main differences are: some factions unlock different units earlier. eg the Aeon unlock have a tech 1 attack boat. And the experimentals; each faction has 3 or 4 different experimental units.  The graphics are not Starcraft level, but they are still REALLY good.

I would reccomend getting Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance and ""Forged Alliance Forever"".A free community hub for SC: Forged Alliance, it includes ""The Vault"" from where you can download custom maps and mods (All free). And it is only place for online play. The campaign is really solid and stands on its feet, but the main focus is on multiplayer.

There really is no game to compare this to. It is a RTS, it is not a 4X RTS. Yet it's more than a normal RTS. I would call it a quarter of its way to a 4X RTS. The game is really easy to get into, but it's a lot like Starcraft where you need to spend time playing it to get good. On a last note: you play other games to feel like you command an army or a small force. You play this game to feel like you command you command EVERYTHING. Much like the Emperor in 40K. Remember to get Forged Alliance Forever. Also don't get Supreme Commander 2, it sucks

Despite its age it still looks modern with high graphics settings and the addition of a 4th race to the game expands the gameplay possibility compared to the original. However the best thing about this game is the loyal community that continue support of the game with new updates and balance changes through the Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) Lobby after support for the game ceased. FAF provides the essential multiplayer this game absolutly thrives on, the game is still very competitive through the multiplayer and therefore I can also recommend Forged Alliance to seasoned veterans of the RTS genre. The game has quite a steep learning curve though and the fact that there can be 1000s of units on the battlefield means that the game can be laggy unless you have a good computer.

...This is without doubt one of the most well crafted RTS games ever..even better than TA which I though I would never say.

I don't know of any other game of any other type with so many features that are just well crafted. Its like everytime a game playing developer on the pay role said 'I dont like the way other RTS' do this couldn't we just....' they listened and did it. The way the display moves from close in full detail to zoomed out icons on map and every thing in between with the mouse wheel is great. The way point system is great (throw in how it handles air transports and its mind blowing). 

The combination of massive complex global tactics and close in exploding goodness is hard to beat.

I haven't touched the story mod yet, I havn't had to. The shear amount of variety present (yet some how well balanced) between the 4 factions and the challanges available via the different non cheating AI have kept me well entertained.

So instead of reviewing it, I'll just say that the things that blow me away every time I play this is the detail, economy and graphics.  The detail lays in the fact that every class of military unit (air, naval, land) has a factory which produces it, and each of those factories can be upgraded up to three times, and will enable you to produce new units (as well as old) with each upgrade.  This alone, and not even considering the complex and amazing ways these units can interact with each other, sets this game automatically in a league by itself in comparison to most other RTS games where you level up your entire civilization with a click of a single button and the lapsing of a single timer.  In SCFA, if your T3 factories go down and you haven't upgraded your commander, you start right back at the beginning.

Secondly economy.  Two resources.  So simple!  So deceivingly simple.  I have never cursed or praised the accompanying deficit/surplus of a resource before, and the clever surplus resource sharing mechanics with allies is something I have never seen before or since, and can lead to some shocking revelations about the state of your own economy as your ally's base takes a beating by the enemy.

Third, this is a beautiful game.  This seems incredible to say considering it is years old and I have played cutting edge games on my 2014 mid to upper range gaming rig to compare it to.  But despite the huge maps and environments, it contains incredible detail on many of the units (UEF engineers will flip their treads down when going into water, for example) and the textures just look plain beautiful.  Zoom out to see the entire map and the coloured icons representing entire armies, or zoom in so that you are just metres away from the surface to see two units duel to the death, and you will have an equally satisfying eye-candy experience.

I used to play this and Supreme Commander back when they were first released, years ago. I hadnt touched this game in several years and its been really fun to play it on a system that handles it in high performance.

In some ways PA is a harder game to play than this and in others this game is as RTS hard mode as it gets. The economy can be very difficult to learn and hold steady. Keep at it though because once you crack the nut of resource mangment you start playing a game that is wholey unique. The maps are huge and the unit count is massive. This game is slower than PA but in a good way. Long games are beautiful to behold; armies of tanks, bots and mobile artillary duke it out while waves and waves of planes fight in the air. Huge artillary batteries and strategic missle launchers lay waste to the map and it always ends up looking like a metal waste land when all the wreckage is strewn across the map. 

If you enjoy very strategic thinking and RTS games I highly recommend this game. If your a casual or new RTS player, play this with caution, it may be overwhelming.",1403994530,1403994530,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many hours have been spent on this via Forged Allaince Forever.

Originally Supreme Commander came out and was widely praised despite a few major flaws. The game came from the creators frustration on modern RTS games and felt they were tactical and not stratigic. So they solved this by increasing the scale and having an incredible phyics engine that even calculates each shot so planes could get hit by artillary in theory. Another prodominate feature was having extrmely large ""experemental"" units and a flow econemy.Major issues were the extreme power needed and the fact that turtling was overpowerd.

Forged Allaince then came with wonderful fixes in the term of new units, and making turtling for the most part unviable. To this day if you play on large multiplayer maps, you can still have prossesing power issues despit the fact it came out almost 7 years ago.

Then came the abortion that is Supreme Commander 2. It destroyed the tech trees and took away the flow econemy that made supreme commander unique. When it took away the flow econemy , experemental units had to become cheaper to be usuable and as a result arn't the entire army killers they were in all the prevous games. Combined with many other poor desitions have left many players dissapointed. Combined with very very poor multiplayer support most players flocked to Forged Allaince Forever which are servers and a lobby for Forged Allaince run by a community. They have made significant changes to SupCom2 but for all intents and purposes is a dead player base.

This game relies on you loving the massive scale of the war and for people who want stragegy games without the rock paper scisor style contering being the most important factor and rather have importance on flanks and cleaver drops while creating forward bases and intelegence. Forged Allaince Forever is still being updated to this day and has a still GROWING community.

Very nice, unique and addictive. Surprisingly for better or worse not what I expected this game to be. It appears to have far more appeal, its very simple to grasp and start playing and there is not as much in terms of tactics. Until you find the hold shift-click combo.
Oh boy.
I can't think of any RTS that allows you to direct your troops in this much detail. Screw formations and all that I was expecting, you can lay out how the tanks will take over the bay, all while laying out how the airplanes will circle the enemy base, drop precise strikes and return, and have ships patrol the area. Some of my patrol routes, scouting and attack patterns got so complex and so beautiful to look at it's pure joy. Very useful, very intuitive, don't underestimate that tool!

Also, the map is awesome. Yeah for once an RTS got the map right, you zoom in and out of your view, and if you zoom out far enough, units and buildings become points, like on a map, and it all becomes a large, interactive, tactical playground. I can't stress how useful and pleasant this is and how seamlessly the normal view and the tactical view blend together.

You must decide the best balance between land, sea, air while carefully managing your resources while denying resources to the other commanders.  The war starts on a small scale with tier 1 units, which are cheap to produce but essential for locking down resources and harassing the enemy early.  The war escalates to tier 2 units which pose a threat directly to an unprotected Commander and butcher tier 1 units.  At this level you will start to see energy shielding, artillery, heavy fortifications and tactical missile strikes.  When (or if) the war reaches tier 3 it's now a high-stakes game of survival.  Every normal unit is a beast compared to the previous tier and the big guns start to come out: Heavy artillery and nuclear missiles, which can devistate entire sections of the map and easily kill a Commander.  Once experimental units hit the field everything changes.  They are nearly unstoppable by conventional units and an inattentive Commander who has let one lumber to their base's gates is moments from defeat.

Beautiful graphics, the shield rendering, explosions, and bullet rains all over the place!

The stock AI is kinda dumb tough, take the Sorian AI mod, and the game becomes much better, very challenging!

Just a shame it's badly programmed... even on top-notch I7's (3610QM & 4700MQ, no extreme overclocked sh**) it causes a pretty heavy load (Full load on 2 cores often), and when playing with a lot of AI's the game can even freeze up. I have no idea how anyone would play this with a 1.8 Ghz processor, which the requirements state.... Probably only possible with a resolution of 320x240.

Also the requirements state like ""1 GB RAM"", well even with 8 GB RAM you still can run into low memory warnings, which is a bug, because there is always 2GB+ RAM still free... it seems this is much more likely to happen when having a resolution of 1920x1080, because I suppose the game has to allocate more memory for the bigger textures.
Whenever you get these low memory warnings, at any given moment your game could just crash, it can mess up your desktop. Meaning you have to reboot your computer by force. (Or if you are not the average person, open up the CMD blindly, and kill the process)

But with some tools like Core Maximizer and Large Address Aware the game runs a lot better.

Multiplayer is very nice in this game, no annoying lag, and there are enough configuration options for all the maps.

Maybe i've said some bad things about this game in the review, but it's definitely worth the money! No doubt!!!
You will love this game, Skirmish mode rocks.

When talking about ratings, I would say this I guess...

Gameplay 9/10 No real glitchy behavior, factions all have good units, each with their own unique strenghts
Graphics 8/10 Very good graphics, especially for it's time, turn on Bloom, and the game looks much better, or download shaders. Of course we're not comparing this to games from 2014.
Audio 9/10 Nice sound effects, like the artillary cannons, or from experimentals
Performance 6/10 Like I said, you need a pretty fancy computer to run this game, with ATLEAST medium graphics, and a resolution bigger than 800x600, a 1.8 Ghz CPU and GPU with 128 MB VRAM ain't going to do the job.

This is probably, In my opinion (And many others) The BEST RTS game ever made. I am not saying this lightly. Take word from a person who loves strategy and is a die hard fan for it. Where to start, Well I should go over the races first. This game takes a bit step upward from other RTS genres out there and includes, not 2, or 3, but 4 unique factions. You have the UEF, Aeon, Cybran, And My favorite. The Seraphim. Each race has a very unique backstory, and the lore is fantastic. But to simplify the factions for you. UEF are your standard Humans. Cybrans are  a cyborg like race. Aeons are an humaniod alien race. And the lizard-like Seraphims are trying to destroy all of them. But lore is not the only thing that it offers. A fantastic gameplay that makes you feel like a commander. You can zoom out to a satelite veiw, and see the whole battlefield, Which is usefull since the maps in this game, can range from 10km to 80km. So the maps are a site to see. Each race has their own set of unique units. Ranging from light assualt walkers, all the way up to a towering expiremental bomber, that drops mini-nukes. The unique aspect of this game that i find the most fun. Is that you are in an ACU. And you are in the battlefield. You can customize your ACU to fit your strategies, Ranging from Defense to offense. Your ACU is also equiped with a engineering suite, which allows you to build structures as well. I could go on about this game. But words alone cannot describe how awesome this game is. I STRONGLY recommend this game to all strategy lovers out there. This is worth every penny, but be sure to get the original supreme commander along with it, since you will not be able to play as UEF, Aeon, or Cybran in multiplayer. however you can in skirmish.",1401082819,1401082819,True,3,0,0.557935893535614014,0,True,False,False

If you've ever played (and liked) Total Annihilation, you'll feel right at home playing this, although the economy system is a lot more detailed despite also being split into mass and energy production, as well as allowing many buildings to upghrade themselves. It also uses a commander, which can be upgraded to fill many different roles, from a powerful builder to a teleporting stealth assassin to a mobile nuclear missile platform! 

The regular gameplay is divided into 3 Tech levels of land, air and naval units complemented with poweful experimental tech which is commonly called tech 4, such as giant assault robots, mobile factories, giant bombers and (rap[id fire) artillery cannons as well as an infinite resource production plant for almost unlimited tactical variation. 

Using Forged Alliance Forever (Player created matchmaking client) you can still play online with up to 12 people in the regular system and it has all kinds of awesome mods available such as playing the campaigns in coop as well. Probably the most awesome thing about the FAF system is that there is a living competitive scene even this long after it was released, and there are still very frequent balance changes to keep the game fresh. In the last official patch the Seraphim (last added race) feel quite overpowered, but in FAF this problem does not exist, and even if a specific unit is deemed too strong, it can look forward to being rebalanced, which is done by having the community suggest changes which are then tested and scrutinized by the best players and newbies alike, which is more awesome than any currently still officially supported game out there!

In the mass opinion of Supreme Commander fans, this game far exceeds its sequel ""Supreme Commander 2""- regarded as a very dumbed-down game due to its console port background. 

Gameplay:
Using a combination of resource management, harvesting, and expansion, the player must use two basic resources to gain the tactical advantage over his enemies, and often his allies- Energy and mass. Whilst mass is used to construct buildings, and units, energy is partially used to run structures and some larger units too. Energy is consumed by the buildings based on tehir activity and is subject to fluctuation based on the energy generated and energy consumed. For example, if a player built a single energy generator, and then built a factory and set it on continuous production of troop transports (all tier 1), this would cause energy to drain massively as teh factory is using more energy than is being generated and/or stored... 

Unit Classification:
Units can be divided into 3 classes with subsequent tiers. Tier 1 are the starting tech and are relatively weak albeit fast. 
Tier 2 units are generally improved on all fronts except maneuvering speed in land cases and tier 3 are the same, the most noticable aspect of all being their damage increase and hitpoints. Air Units in thsi game have fuel tanks and if run out mid flight will crash land and die (quite realistic). 
The three unit classes are Land, air and naval, each featuring an engineer that can use that terrain.

Experimentals:
An excellent Idea cenceived in this game was the expeerimental class (unnoficial tier 4). These units are so big, that it will take a while to construct one and require large amounts of resources whilst also being directly constructed without the use of a factory. (I recommend using quite a few negineer robots to manufacture one and make sure you can spare the enrgy for fabrication).
Some of the units range from collossal air units to enourmous walking land units to intimidating naval ships, all with their own capabilities and special features (i.e. large lasers, remote aircraft manufacture and storage).

Overall Impression:

Wargame: AirLand Battle and Supreme Commander + Forged Alliance (I count it as one as it is an expansion off of Supreme Commander). There are no overpowered units, not by a long shot. There are weak units and there are strong units and, really, the only determinant is the tier of the unit. Sure, you can have units that wipe out entire armies, navies and air forces in less than the blink of an eye (well, not exactly, but you get the idea), but they aren't unstoppable, and they have their weaknesses. You can build a Collosus and it can get taken down very quickly and efficiently if the other team plays its cards right. I don't think I've seen a game outside of a tactical strategy game, like Wargame, in which positioning, composition and your skill factors in so much. Between managing and micromanaging hundreds of units, maximizing resource income and keeping up with what is happening on the map, you barely have enough time to draw one calm breath.

I played the beta for SupCom, so I have to admit, I knew what i was buying. This game is ambitious, and sets out to accomplish alot. The only thing really holding this game back from greatness is the blandness in play style of the races. I will explain

Graphically, this game is very appealing, because of its size, scope, and style. It feels like real war, visually, and the mapping possibilities are endless. The maps are a little nondescript sometimes, and the models aren't exactly high poly, but the trade off for size of the battlefield is well worth it.

The Orchestral themes are nice, but a little short. It feels like they have about 5 tracks of music for the whole game. The sound effects are just right, but nothing special

Gameplay is what really makes this game a winner. The size, scale, variety of tactics and unit types make this game amazing to play, you just have to experience it for yourself, it's awesome.However, barring aesthetic differences, the races play almost identically. I think more could have been done to make their play styles distinctive. That is really this games one failing. It is still very much worth an RTS fans money.

The game is big and games are quite long, you play as an Commander-Unit from the future. Your job is to construct a base, get resources and annihilate your enemies, in various ways. What I personally like is that this RTS treats you like an adult, no silly units and easy rookie-gamers. But when you put multiple hours in this game it will give you great satisfaction, it is not a game to play just a simple half an hour, but if you are commited to become better there is  a great and fanatic community.

Although this game is already multiple years old, and has a smaller community, it deserves more attention.

I think I'll start by telling about something that happened earlier today while I was playing a multiplayer match, an experience that quite well describes several of the qualities of this game. It was quite late into the game, about 30-40 min in and everyone had grown quite powerful. My Armored Command Unit, your most important unit that you use to build your whole army and whose death means you're out of the game in most cases, was under heavy attack from a swarm of Gunships and a Heavy Artillery Installation firing away from the other side of the map. I managed to bring my fighter planes in to take care of the enemy Gunships but the ACU was really low on health, another devastating artillery shell was incomming and if it hit I would be out of the game. The shell was going straight for it's target, I was going to lose. But I did not, straight above the ACU the shell hit an unfortunate fighter passing above and destroyed it. An artillery shell from the other side of the map hit a ridiculously small and fast moving fighter plane, I could hardly believe my eyes.

There is an unbelievable attention to detail in this game, every projectile is calculated individually which adds great tactical depth. Good micro and smart use of the lay of the land can have a significant effect on the outcome of a skirmish as shots might miss,  impact hills, rocks or units they where not intended for. This combined with the games truly epic scale brings one of the game's few minor drawbacks, seven years after release even the fastest computers have to slow down when literally thousands of futuristic aircraft clash.

The scale is another thing worth mentioning, the size of the maps range from quite small 5x5km maps to the enomous 81x81km battlefields that it take several minutes for even the fastest units to cross. So no matter if you want to wage war for hours against 7 opponents or if you're interested in intense StarCraft styled matches Forged Alliance will provide.
   There is also a great variety of units, from small land scouts that take seconds to build to colossal experimental units that could take hours for a single engineer to construct but are able to singlehandly defeat huge armies. The balance between units is good, all four factions are viable and almost all units fill some role during some part of the game without any unit standing out as particularly overpowered which is quite impressive as there are hundreds of them.

To summarize, this game is a polished gem. The gameplay, both single- and multiplayer, is great, the design is amazing, the sands of time hardly seem to affect the game at all and the replay value is close to infinite. I'm a huge fan of real-time strategy games and I honestly believe that Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is the apex of the genre.",1386127864,1386641035,True,565,4,0.963137686252593994,16,True,False,False

The campaign is nice though nothing exceptional (and if you want to play it I suggest starting with ""Supreme Commander"" instead of this stand-alone expansion) but the game truly shines in Skirmish & Multiplayer.
Maps range from about 20x20km to about 80x80km while units meassure between 10 and 100+ meters in size and ranges vary froma couple hundred meters to several kilimeters.
