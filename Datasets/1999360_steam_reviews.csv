I think they all fit. This game is whatever you make of it. It's ultimately a pool full of ducks and physics mechanics, with some fun, occasionally repetitive, soothing background music. Sometimes weird stuff happens. The controls can be a little wonky but, relax, it's just ducks. 

I have a really hard time focusing on work when I'm feeling down, and have that terrible habit of resorting to social media (which of course never helps) for some dopamine. Placid ducks is replacing that for me. I'm keeping it running while I work today, and the mild, not too interesting music is perfect to work to, and checking in on how my ducks are doing between tasks is giving me that sweet, sweet dopamine without sucking me into a twitter argument. 

I think I'll stream this and name ducks after my subscribers. My only wish is that we could finagle the timer on when ducks drop - I work in pomodoro shifts and I'd really love to set the timer to drop a duck every time it's time to take a pomo break, letting the splash sound be a trigger that it's breaktime.

This seemingly innocuous object, borne from the annals of playful capriciousness, accompanies me with a sense of gravitas and serves as my unwavering and peripatetic companion.

With an air of facetiousness, I have bestowed upon this inanimate yet strangely animate-looking entity the epithet of ""my quixotically quacking compatriot."" This nomenclatural whimsy, despite its seemingly lighthearted nature, belies the remarkable and enigmatic role that this effigy plays in the tapestry of my daily existence.

It is nothing short of a marvel how this unassuming rubber duck, this epitome of synthetic avian grace, has become a veritable fulcrum for the initiation and sustenance of diverse and intricate dialogues within the rich tapestry of my quotidian interactions. Its presence, perched as it is upon the precipice of novelty and absurdity, serves as a lighthouse amidst the turbulent seas of conversational mediocrity.

Moreover, what adds an extra layer of intrigue to this whimsical situation is the fact that my ""quixotically quacking compatriot"" has not merely remained confined to the sphere of my personal affairs. In the age of the digital diaspora, it has birthed its own digital identity, flourishing on the global stage of Instagram, where it stands as a beacon to those who share in the esoteric and specialized domain of rubber avian connoisseurs.

This online presence has not only given rise to an ever-expanding and devout cohort of aficionados but has also served as a testament to the boundless potential of the internet to amplify and magnify the idiosyncrasies of human existence, no matter how trivial or surreal they may be.

In sum, my possession of this erudite avian effigy, this rubber duck, transcends mere ownership; it encapsulates the essence of whimsy, absurdity, and the power of the human penchant for storytelling and community-building in the most unexpected of places, be it the tangible world that I navigate daily or the boundless digital realm where the boundaries of shared experience continue to expand beyond the ordinary and into the extraordinary.",1708788450,1708788450,True,4,1,0.54867255687713623,0,True,False,False

You tell your therapist you were in your favorite place, a place that is very special to you. Being a plastic duck in a pool..

The duck (containing my soul) decided to go down a slide.

A snow plow violently catapulted the duck (containing my soul) onto the mountain cliffs.

Limbus Company (one of the other ducks) was there.

We snowboarded down the mountain until the fog swallowed us.

I waited in the darkness.

Eventually, I heard a sound.

There was the cable car, lowering into the mist.

It lifted me out of the darkness, and out of the fog.

I saw Markiplier (he is also one of the ducks) waiting at the ice rink to board.

We rode to the top of the cable-car, and the floor fell out from under us.

We splashed into the pleasantly still pool.

The game features 3 breathtaking maps, the Infinity Pool, Quacking the Ice, and Hippospace. 2/3 the maps are DLC bound so you'll have to aquire to appropriate DLC's to be able to go to those maps. And each map has its own set of unique ducklings but in a long run you'll have them all! Like the famous line says, Gotta catch them all!

One time, I saw the most beautiful piece of cinema. It was a story about love, compassion, evolution. The red, green, and blue jelly ducklings had a task and a very difficult task indeed. Among a sea of ducklings, they have to find and reunite themselves in order to create the ultimate being. Once they all reunited, the ceremony begins and the ritual starts. The 3 jelly ducklings must combine their powers, this emerging the ultimate being. Big Jelly Duck. The ultimate duck. The mightest duck. All the heavens into one, Big Jelly duck.

The graphics were top-notch, I could practically see the plastic sheen on the ducks' feathers. The game play was smooth and intuitive, I felt like I was truly a plastic duck floating in a pond. 
But it wasn't just the technical  aspects that drew me in, oh no. It was the sheer ridiculousness of the game. I mean, who would have thought that watching a plastic duck could be so entertaining? I spent hours just waddling around, quacking at other plastic ducks, and causing general chaos in the pool. And let me tell you, it's a stress-free life being a plastic duck. No bills to pay, no responsibilities, just floating and quacking. 
Overall, I would give Placid Plastic Duck Simulator a solid 10 out of 10. It's ridiculous, nonsensical, and just plain fun. Plus, who doesn't love a good plastic duck? Trust me, you won't regret getting quacking with this game.",1705746718,1705746718,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

From the moment you launch the game, you're transported into a world of tranquil beauty, where simplicity reigns supreme. The game's core mechanic, watching rubber ducks serenely float in gently rippling water, is executed with such finesse that it becomes a meditative experience.

The graphics are stunningly realistic, making each duck's journey across the calm waters a visual treat. The attention to detail in the water's texture and the ducks' movements is nothing short of spectacular. This game isn't just about observing; it's about feeling the peacefulness that each floating duck brings.

The sound design deserves special mention. The soft sounds of water and the subtle, relaxing quacks of the ducks create an ambient symphony that soothes the soul. It's the perfect background noise for unwinding after a long day or for finding a moment of peace in a hectic schedule.

What sets Placid Plastic Duck Simulator apart is its ability to make something so simple feel so profound. There are no levels, no scores, just the endless delight of watching these charming rubber ducks embark on their endless, peaceful journey. This game is a reminder of the beauty in simplicity, a digital oasis in our complex world.

In conclusion, Placid Plastic Duck Simulator is more than a game; it's a therapeutic experience. It invites players to slow down, breathe, and enjoy the moment. Whether you're a gamer looking for a change of pace or someone seeking a slice of tranquility, this game is a must-try. It's a shining example of how minimalism can lead to a deeply satisfying and enriching experience.",1705729929,1705729929,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,1,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

As soon as I sought to warn the community the mods permanently banned me.  So obviously they are making lots of money off all the theft!

I and every other person who gets stolen off deserves compensation for this!  We also deserve gaming companies that will look after our safety instead of allowing well known threats through.  This one has a LOT of scrutiny on it...well good, eventually it will break, yet how many hurt  by then?  I will pursue until the malicious code IS REMOVED from this game!

I will go place a WELL EARNED report on web of trust now (finished on their publisher site).
Also just to give you an idea HOW EVIL these blackhats that did this are, they think it is funny.  They joke
about what they have done inside the game itself, in the form of an achievement that puts it right in your face what they are doing behind your back.  So utterly vile who-ever did this!

POSTEDIT:  I have since reviewed the EVIDENCE on my stream (Twitch) and have realised that this MOST LIKELY is a PRANK (though still unsure as there are so many threads detailing this).  So this is some WAR OF THE WORLDS kind of dark humour IMO.  You caused ME STRESS, got me banned from a public forum, and earned your first WOT report on your publisher for it.  I am at least owed an apology, I have been hurt by a prankster.  Something is OWED to me for this!  Until I receive that paid dept.  I am going to leave things up in their air on whether this program contains a miner!  In any event, what went from being like one of my absolute favourite companies/games has now turned into this, good job (jk) who-ever put this stupid VILE joke in the game (or maybe even worse has placed the actual miner in the game).",1705454120,1705506229,False,3,2,0.377377957105636597,2,True,False,False

Move over high-intensity action games and mind-bending puzzles; it's time to embark on a quack-filled adventure that will leave you questioning your life choices in the best possible way.

From the moment you boot up the game, you're greeted by a serene pond with a cast of characters that could rival any A-list Hollywood lineup ‚Äì plastic ducks. Yes, you read that right. Plastic ducks. But don't let their immobile appearance fool you; these ducks are about to take you on a wild ride.

The gameplay is simple yet strangely addictive. Your mission? Waddle around the pond, quack at random intervals, and engage in heated debates with your fellow plastic comrades about the meaning of life. It's like a philosophical symposium with feathers.

The graphics are surprisingly realistic ‚Äì if you're into photorealistic plastic duck simulations, that is. The developers spared no expense in capturing the essence of a tranquil pond, complete with algae-covered rocks and the occasional leaf drifting by. The attention to detail is quacking impressive.

One of the game's standout features is the quack customization. Yes, you can personalize your duck's quack to suit your mood. Feeling sassy? Choose the sassy quack. Feeling mysterious? Opt for the mysterious quack. The possibilities are as endless as the pond itself.

The multiplayer mode is where Placid Plastic Duck Simulator truly shines. Team up with friends to form the most elite quacking squad, or engage in intense quack-offs to determine who is the ultimate quack master. Just be warned ‚Äì the quack competition is fierce, and friendships may be tested.

While the game offers hours of quacktastic entertainment, it does have a few drawbacks. The lack of a storyline leaves you questioning the purpose of your plastic existence, and the absence of a quack-to-English translator can make communication with your fellow ducks a bit challenging.

In conclusion, Placid Plastic Duck Simulator is a quack-filled rollercoaster of hilarity that will have you questioning the meaning of life, one quack at a time. If you've ever dreamed of living the plastic duck life, this game is a must-play. Just be prepared to quack your way to victory and ponder the deep philosophical questions that come with being a plastic waterfowl.

By the gods of the digital waters, this isn't just a game ‚Äì it's a transcendental journey into the serene life of plastic ducks. Imagine, if you will, the zenith of gaming, the magnum opus of simulators, the very pinnacle of what it means to replicate the enthralling existence of the most majestic inanimate waterfowl. This, my friends, is it!

I've spent eons, or what feels like it, gazing upon the hypnotic beauty of my glossy avian companions, floating without a care upon pixelated ponds that reflect the heavens themselves. You begin to understand that this is not just pixels on a screen. No, it's a philosophical expedition; it‚Äôs the search for inner peace amidst the maelstrom of our daily lives.

""Placid Plastic Duck Simulator"" lulls you into a state of harmony with its revolutionary lack of objectives. The purpose? You are a duck - no, you *become* the duck. Feel the gentle waves generated by your soul echoing through the duck's undisturbed world. It's not about the destination; it's about the meditative journey of doing absolutely quack-all.

Each frame of this game could be hung in the Louvre, and the Mona Lisa herself would weep at the sight. Dynamic lighting cascades over every curve of your plastic body. The sunsets? They‚Äôre a chef's kiss to the retina - an explosion of colors that would make Van Gogh toss his palette and declare, ‚ÄúI can never top that!‚Äù

The symphonic soundscape is a minimalist masterpiece. You'll hear the soothing whispers of the wind, the occasional belle of a distant buoy, and of course, the dulcet, plastic *plop* of your duck breaching the surface tension of reality. Wear headphones, and you might just reach enlightenment.

Each time you return, the game whispers a new secret into your very soul. Perhaps it is the quiver of a new water ripple, or a shift in the gentle floating mechanics. Eternal, like the ocean's waves, ""Placid Plastic Duck Simulator"" invites you to drift into its endless cycle of serene simulation.

In conclusion, if you do not find yourself downloading ""Placid Plastic Duck Simulator"" at this very moment, then, my fellow gamer, you have not yet discovered the true meaning of life.

[b] [i] I recommend this game for those that love ducks. It's a very relaxing game about watching ducks /  scenery. you can choose which duck to watch by clicking on it, or choose between fixed camera points (you can click on some objects to change camera position).  [/i] [/b]

Ducks will automatically spawn after some time, one duck at a time except for some events that happens randomly in the game. 

There is a nice variety of ducks in the base game.

Some ducks will make distinct sounds when you do a left click on them, It's nice.

There is only one map in the base game at the writing of this review, and while the base map looks really cool and has some nice events, it can get stale because there is not much variety in there and the map is really small, which is a bit sad, I think there should be at least 3 maps in the base game, and two maps for each DLC with more detail on it, that's my only complaint that I have about it. 

Despite what I've already said about only one map, if you are planning to use it as a background or just to relax with the sounds and ducks floating around, then it should be fine, but I still think there should be more variety in the base map or 2 other maps in the base game.

The Radio in the base map has some good songs, I also love the voice recordings in there, It's kinda funny, it fits really well with the map and the ducks altogether.

[i] Options: You have graphics option to optimize fps if that's an issue. You can give each duck a name, disable duck spawn, and disable music (the radio).  [/i]

https://www.npr.org/2011/03/29/134923863/moby-duck-when-28-800-bath-toys-are-lost-at-sea

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3079029016

The game is set in the backyard of an isolated vacation home located on a tiny island‚Ä¶.somewhere in the ocean. And in that backyard is a pool party, replete with a two deck pool, a pool slide, some deck chairs, floaties, a tiny gedo blaster for some sick tunes and a bit of news, beer, and those sweet ocean views. It‚Äôs basically a Corona commercial, lol.

And by party, I mean a Duck party. One by one, a variety of ducks drop into the pool from‚Ä¶.somewhere. You can quack the ducks, many of whom have some unique quacks, and you can control the camera with three different points of view around the pool as well as one duck focused camera, which you can use to scroll through your ducks to see what they‚Äôre up to. And you also have zoom camera controls.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3093327786

The ducks themselves (mostly) float around soaking in the ambiance. Some have some special abilities, such as short distance flight, breathing fire, putting out fires, and so on. There is a day/night cycle, weather cycles, and also special events such as ships passing by, UFOs kidnapping ducks, etc‚Ä¶

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3079028671

My favorite duck is the Ace Frehley duck, who offers a sweet guitar lick as its quack.

This game is Steam Deck compatible.

And that‚Äôs a pretty fair summation of the base game. This game makes me chuckle and brings a smile to my face. You basically just fire up the game, Duck and Chill. A nicer alternative to screen savers. The game would benefit from either a wider song selection or the ability to play your own tunes, but otherwise, it's a flawless experience.

Of which there are many, judging by the amount of overwhelmingly positive reviews. PDS was an experimental try for me, as I‚Äôm not into either of those tags, but it seemed hilariously silly, visually stylish and with a promise of mysteries that one might need to dig into. 

It did deliver on all those accounts. For example:

-	Not just the premise is rather wacky, but the game manages to be highly self-aware of said wackiness, without a single action or a line of dialogue. Just quacks.

-	It‚Äôs hard to imagine anyone who won‚Äôt be chuckling/grinning or ‚Äúawwww‚Äù-ing once the ducks start appearing. They are cute. Including the one with a knife.

-	There is a super-stylish sunrise-to-sunset loop going on, and it‚Äôs visually striking. It also makes you desperately want to take a vacation.  

-	There‚Äôs pretty cool soundtrack coming out of the radio ‚Äì a mix of news/ads/shows and snazzy tunes in different languages. Some are seriously amping up that anxious desire for a faraway vacation which has already blossomed to epic proportions ‚Äì once you noticed a cruise ship in the purple setting sun.

-	There are, indeed, some deeper mysteries going on that require quite a bit of observation skills and a good thinking cap on, some of which, from my understanding, are still ongoing and haven‚Äôt been solved as of this writing.

Essentially, there‚Äôs fun to be had all around‚Ä¶ IF you‚Äôre willing to simply stare at your screen for hours. The ducks appear at certain time intervals on their own (the further into the game the longer it takes), and there isn‚Äôt anything active you can do as a player besides picking them up, pressing a button to hear them quack or naming them. That‚Äôs it. There are a few vantage points you can choose to watch the pool from, but that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll be ultimately doing the whole game ‚Äì watching them. Or you can opt to do some cleaning, cooking or working-out while ducks steadily populate your pool with a background of starry night or sunny afternoon. It‚Äôs very chill and not very engaging. With such a low interactivity point, PDS technically doesn‚Äôt need you to play it at all ‚Äì it does a fine job of it on its own.

And this, in turn, seems to be totally cool with a great number of people, so I almost feel like I missed out on some great secret. What do all these people enjoy so much? How can they seem to be so engaged? Man, WHAT IS IT that I‚Äôm not seeing? Ugh. I‚Äôll just leave this one for the cool kids that know how to relax with their games and go point‚Äôn‚Äôclick myself to exhaustion or mindlessly mash some buttons just to feel alive.

""Placid Plastic Duck Simulator"" is a whimsical journey into the heart of duckdom, where serenity meets hilarity in the most unexpected ways. The concept of not being able to control the plastic duck might sound like a departure from traditional gaming, but it's this very lack of control that makes the game a true standout in the pond of gaming experiences.

From the moment you dip your webbed feet into the virtual pond, the simplicity of the graphics draws you into a tranquil world of plastic paradise. The placid water, the gentle ripples, and the plastic sheen of the ducks create a visually pleasing environment that's oddly calming, setting the perfect stage for the unpredictable chaos that ensues.

The spawning of a new plastic duck every five minutes is a stroke of genius. It keeps the gameplay fresh, ensuring that each session is a new adventure. The diverse cast of ducks, each with its own special ability, adds a layer of hilarity to the mix. Whether it's watching a duck shoot water with playful precision, witnessing a fiery fowl breathe fire in the most plastic way imaginable, or marveling at a propeller hat duck take flight, the creativity in the special abilities adds a delightful twist to the otherwise placid pond setting.

The lack of control over the ducks surprisingly becomes part of the game's charm. It's a testament to the developers' ingenuity that the unpredictability doesn't lead to frustration but rather to a sense of joyful anticipation. The interactions between the plastic ducks create a dynamic and comical environment, turning the pond into a stage for a lighthearted and entertaining spectacle.

""Placid Plastic Duck Simulator"" is more than just a game; it's an experience that invites players to embrace the unexpected, to find joy in the simplicity of plastic ducks, and to appreciate the humor that can be found in the most placid of settings. It's a game that proves that sometimes, letting go of control can lead to the most quacktastic adventures. If you're looking for a delightful escape into the world of plastic whimsy, this game is an absolute gem that'll leave you quacking with joy.",1703144591,1703144591,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed letting it run while I occasionally checked in to see what nonsense the ducks were up to this time as well as what new ducks had joined the party.

The soundtrack that plays on the base/main radio station is NOT the music available on what is listed as the OST on Spotify and elsewhere. Not Bandcamp either. I've found it on YouTube but nowhere else. My game never would let me change the radio station but I've seen videos of others doing it. Perhaps this is where the other music comes from, but I learned to love just the starting station loop and I don't think I need anything more.

Placid Plastic Duck Simulator is a game where you watch ducks spawn in a pool, and get a different one each time, you can also name your ducks, you can't move them around or anything though, just purely watching and naming ducks, it's a funny and unique concept, it's also pretty cute and for a cheap price of $1.99 it was worth it to buy!


[b]Downsides:[/b]

This game can get boring because you are pretty much just watching ducks spawn and getting badges, that's the exact pure reason of this game, and although it's a unique and cute concept it does get boring.

It's also pretty annoying that you can't control your ducks, you can't move them around or anything, they kinda just float where ever they want to.

But this game is still unique and cute, I by no means play it all the time but it's cute.

Placid Plastic Duck Simulator
----------

PPDS is barely a game, but it's still a fun and calm experience. The premise is simple: lounge around a swimming pool where rubber ducks will occasionally drop in, and you can ""collect"" all duck types over time. The ducks mostly do nothing except drift around, occasionally moving down water slides and up tubes to bob around the different levels of the pool.  There are a couple of ducks that have special properties, like stone ducks that instantly sink to the bottom of the pool or firefighter ducks that squirt water on occasion. Rare events will happen, like cruise ships sailing by or UFO sightings, and these can sometimes result in special ducks appearing in your pool.

Overall, there's not much to Placid Plastic Duck Simulator, but I still enjoy just having it run on my PC while I do something in the same room. The interesting background music and overall atmosphere of the ""game"" make it fun to just watch or even keep running like a screensaver. It also doesn't hurt that it's dirt cheap ($2 USD at time of review.)",1701824130,1701824130,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

!!!!!Chilli con carne recipe!!!!!

if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Chilli con carne recipe you've come to the right place,

Ingredients

1 large onion
1 red pepper
2 garlic cloves
1 tbsp oil
1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder (or 1 level tbsp if you only have mild)

1 tsp paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
500g lean minced beef
1 beef stock cube
400g can chopped tomatoes
¬Ω tsp dried marjoram
1 tsp sugar (or add a thumbnail-sized piece of dark chocolate along with the beans instead, see tip)

2 tbsp tomato pur√©e
410g can red kidney beans
plain boiled long grain rice, to serve
soured cream, to serve

Directions

STEP 1
Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.

STEP 2
Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.

STEP 3
Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).

STEP 4
Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.

STEP 5
Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.

STEP 6
Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

STEP 7
Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.

STEP 8
Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.

STEP 9
Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.

With the price of the original game itself, I have no quarrels. It's only $2, and it's just trying to be a cute little idle game. They even added multiplayer lobbies, which can help add a lot of neat fun to the game. Yes, you don't ""do"" anything in the game except watch ducks and open presents. I have no issues with that. 
The same can not be said for the DLC.
It's baffling to me that you have to pay for the DLC for this game. I wouldn't mind if the DLC added something interesting to the game and was at a fair price, but all the DLC just adds new duck skins and a few levels. The fact that each bit of DLC is just as expensive as the base game is ridiculous. If you wanted to buy all the DLC as well as the base game, it would cost about 10-12 dollars. For me, I'm an achievement hunter. I got all the achievements when the most recent DLC was quaking the ice. I got all the achievements, and was dumbfounded when I checked back a month or so later, and basically saw that I would have to turn over a couple bucks to get my completion back. As I'm writing this review, there's even more DLC I'd have to buy to get 100% completion. I don't mind developers adding more content to ruin people's completion of their games. I myself have plenty of games in my library that have done that. However, it's insulting to make people fork over even more money for pretty much nothing substantial content-wise if they want to maintain 100% completion.

Overall, I have no issue with the game itself, but it would mean the world to me and I'd assume a lot of other people if the devs could either price the DLC fairly or make it free, rather than forcing us to pay a $12 package for something only really worth a couple bucks.",1701071973,1701071973,False,3,0,0.492330431938171387,1,True,False,False

Love the puzzles, creativity and how the ducks interact with each other.

I originally invested in this game because I saw the price was low and if I got bored I wouldn't feel bad about spending the money.

Now I can't imagine life without this game.  Such a small investment for such a life changing experience.

I've lived a life of struggle.  A life filled with regret.  Haunted by my life decisions near constantly.  The moment that first duck dropped down into my pool, I felt relief.  I felt.. alive.  True tranquility.

As each new duck landed in my pool, I felt emotions that I had bottled up for a lifetime come flowing out like the water slide in the game.  I realized I wasn't living my truth.   I got divorced shortly after and sold my cats.  Because why would I let my ex-wife have the cats?

Now I just watch the ducks.  The ducks that are always there.  They will always come back and they will always be there for me.  They won't ever let you down.  All you need is ducks.",1677002165,1700700829,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update after so many hours: My enjoyment has gone up significantly after getting my hands on a space-age gaming laptop with enough power to do 60 FPS, and the ducks are also unironically the cure to my insomnia. Now if only they would put in a sleep timer...

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ 

If you've ever stared into the vacant eyes of a rubber duck and thought, ""What if this thing is secretly plotting my demise?"" ‚Äì well, Placid Plastic Duck Simulator has heard your paranoid quacks and cranked them up to eleven.

From the moment you launch this game, you're greeted by the unsettling squeak of rubber on virtual water, setting the tone for the psychological mind-boggle that lies ahead. Forget fluffy clouds and rainbow bridges; this is a world where the benign becomes bizarre, and your childhood bath toys are now emissaries of existential dread.

Visually, Placid Plastic Duck Simulator boasts graphics so realistic you'll question whether you're playing a game or having an existential crisis. The plastic ducks are meticulously detailed, each one with a face that could give Chucky a run for his money. The water, now an ominous pool of quivering uncertainty, reflects the unnerving truth that lies beneath the surface of the seemingly innocent bath time companions.

Gameplay involves navigating a bathtub filled with malevolent plastic ducks that seem eerily aware of your every move. The rubbery adversaries engage in conspiratorial quacks, creating an atmosphere more tension-filled than a Hitchcock film ‚Äì except, you know, with ducks.

The game's music and sound effects are unreal too, amazing vibe and sounds that have me grooving throughout the day.

As you progress through the different maps (most locked behind DLC), you'll uncover a plot thicker than the bubbles in a bubble bath. Cryptic messages written in foamy bubbles hint at a dark secret, a conspiracy involving the very essence of rubber duck existence. It's a narrative so convoluted, you'll find yourself questioning the nature of reality and the sanity of your own bathtub.

In conclusion, Placid Plastic Duck Simulator is a surreal journey into the depths of bathtub-based horror. It successfully transforms the mundane into the absurd, proving that even the most innocent childhood memories can be warped into a quacktastic nightmare. So, don your virtual snorkel, embrace the suds, and prepare for a rubber ducky showdown that will leave you questioning the very fabric of your bathtime reality. Quack, or be quacked!",1700138490,1700138490,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There's no greater hit of serotonin than the one you get from watching your duck meter fill up, indicating that you're getting another duck <3 

No but seriously. This is quite possible the best Idle/relaxing game there is on steam. I genuinely don't have one negative thing to say about this game. 

Pros: 
- Relaxing music. Great game to have up while studying, working, or just hanging out. It's incredibly comforting. 
- SO MANY DUCKS. And they're all amazing in their own way. You'll definitely have favorites, but you'll honestly never not be excited to receive a new duck. 
- Graphics are a big thumbs up and I wasn't expecting much considering it's an idle game. But it's amazing. 
- Achievement Hunters: Easy achievements. Leave your game running for several hours and you'll have the tools you need to obtain every achievement. Don't like my hour count fool you. You could probably get all the achievements in... I'll say 24 hours but that accounts for bag RNG. Good RNG may make it a shorter time frame. 
- Family friendly! Good for everyone!
- Clever Easter Eggs! More being found everyday and some we still haven't completely figured out yet!
- The most peaceful community I've ever seen. 

Cons: 
- I'll never get to experience the joy of playing it for the first time again. (until they release more DLC) 

I love this game. It's my go to for when I'm working from home just to have up in the background. 10000/10 game. This is not a meme. This is not a joke. I'm dead serious. Best $2 I've ever spent and I can honestly say I would've paid more for it. It's single handedly fighting my depression.",1700138227,1700138227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a unique and indescribable charm in watching those rubber ducks lazily drift in the pool, and over time, they've become more than just virtual entities ‚Äì they're my digital companions, my quirky family.

Closing the game feels like bidding farewell to loved ones, and the resistance to parting ways with those floating ducks has become a daily ritual. It's not a matter of completing levels or achieving objectives; it's about savoring the simplicity of their aimless journey. Leaving the game open has become a conscious choice, allowing the ducks to perpetually navigate the serene waters in an unending loop of tranquility.

There's a strange but heartwarming connection that has developed. I find myself caring for these virtual quackers as if they were my own, each drift across the screen filling me with a sense of oddly genuine joy. The lack of complexity in the game is its strength ‚Äì it's an open canvas for forging a relationship with these rubber companions, and I've embraced it wholeheartedly.

Placid Plastic Duck Simulator transcends the conventional definition of a game. It's a digital haven where my love for these rubber ducks knows no bounds. They've become my feathered confidants, and the prospect of closing the game feels akin to parting with family. In a world filled with intricate narratives and challenging quests, this simplistic simulation has carved a niche in my heart, offering a quiet escape into the comforting embrace of rubber duck companionship that I never knew I needed.",1700077109,1700077109,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game doesn't cost a significant amount of money yet you might find yourself enjoying it a lot more than you originally thought, if you tend to sit around being bored of the games you already have, you can just open this game with some snacks and a drink, get in a discord call with your friends and just enjoy the ducks swimming around in the beautiful swimming pool.",1699442890,1699442890,True,2,0,0.538461565971374512,0,True,False,False

""Placid Plastic Duck Simulator"" stands as one such masterpiece that not only captivated my imagination but also catalyzed a transformative journey. This unassuming game, with its serene setting and simple premise, unveiled a world of introspection, mindfulness, and unexpected life lessons.

The Oasis of Tranquility

From the moment I immersed myself in the ethereal world of Placid Plastic Duck Simulator, I was transported to a tranquil oasis that provided respite from the chaos of everyday life. The serene pond, nestled amidst a lush, idyllic landscape, became my sanctuary. The gently rippling water, the rustling leaves, and the distant call of birds formed a symphony of serenity that resonated within my soul.

Unearthing the Power of Mindfulness

At its core, Placid Plastic Duck Simulator is a testament to the art of mindfulness. Through the simplest of interactions with the plastic ducks, I learned to be present in the moment. Each quack, each graceful glide, became an invitation to be fully aware, to savor the nuances of existence that often go unnoticed in the rush of modern life.

As I guided my virtual self through the pond, I discovered that even the most mundane activities could be infused with a profound sense of purpose. The act of feeding the ducks, once a perfunctory task, evolved into a mindful ritual. With each morsel, I forged a connection with the virtual creatures, mirroring the deeper connections we form with the world around us when we approach it with intention and gratitude.

Embracing the Impermanence of Change

Placid Plastic Duck Simulator's dynamic weather system served as a poignant metaphor for life's impermanence. The shifting seasons, from the warm embrace of summer to the melancholy of autumn, reminded me that change is an inevitable and beautiful part of existence. It taught me to appreciate the ebb and flow of life, to find solace in the cyclical nature of experiences, and to recognize that every moment holds its own unique beauty.

Nurturing Empathy and Compassion

In the world of Placid Plastic Duck Simulator, the virtual ducks became more than mere lines of code; they became companions on my journey. Through subtle animations and interactions, I found myself empathizing with their virtual existence. Their quirks, their individual personalities, instilled in me a profound sense of compassion. This newfound empathy extended beyond the digital realm, urging me to approach the people and creatures in my own life with a deeper understanding and kindness.

A Catalyst for Real-Life Change

The lessons gleaned from Placid Plastic Duck Simulator transcended the confines of the virtual world, seeping into my daily life. I found myself more attuned to the beauty around me, more present in my interactions, and more open to the inevitable ebb and flow of life's currents. Through this unassuming game, I discovered a newfound sense of purpose and a deeper connection with the world and the people in it.

Conclusion

Placid Plastic Duck Simulator stands as a testament to the transformative power of interactive art.

Before I experienced Placid Plastic Duck Simulator I was miserable. But the moment I invested in this game, my life changed, everything got better.

 I discovered the meaning of life within my elongated Plastic Duck sessions. These sessions taught me how beautiful existence is, and the purpose for the small things in life. The simplistic art of the facile rubber ducks bobbing in the calm waves, and swaying in the soothing, serene breeze really brings a sense of tranquillity within the chaos of the outside world.

The concept of these indifferent creatures existing in the vast emptiness of nowhere, whilst still being joyful assisted me in understanding how much life really matters. All that is of significance in living is happiness. 

In conclusion Placid Plastic Duck Simulator has explained to me many lessons involving the meaning of everything. These lessons can be also be explained to you, if you buy this great game.",1698175062,1698175062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

it made me into a greater, more higher being,
I may of even reached Nirvana.

I look down on you now as you read this,
But at the same time we are as equals
But you look up to me.

I have felt emotion, betrayal, threat, love and pain through these ducks,
these ducks of love and war
i feel like the knife duck is after me but the stone duck is protecting my soul
protecting my soul from the harsh, cruel and unforgiving world.

The ducks remind me how time goes by so fast and yet we choose to ignore it,
what have we been doing with our lives if it wasn't for these beautiful, magical and lovely ducks
I feel like a peasant to a God when I see this in my Steam library

Unfortunately the side effects of these ducks are costly,
once you experience them once, twice, thrice or any infinite number of times
you will never peak in anything else.

Your mother gave birth to you or they specifically adopted you
or maybe it was your father
its any of those unless you're Batman
but I was responsible for my own birth, just to witness these ducks
and you are about to get a new parent, forget your old ones|
these ducks will be your new family.

I bid you farewell brave traveler, in these reviews of ducks and chaos, goodbye.",1681512496,1697654376,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Even better yet, have you wanted to do nothing, but WITH rubber duckies of various suits and unique cosmetics? Well the waits over folks, now you can literally sit there and do nothing but watch little duckies float around in a relaxing environment and quack your little heart out. 
Not to even get you started on achievements, good gracious. You earn achievements on the FLY by doing NOTHING. (Aka... NOTHING) All the achievements I've gotten thus far, I have not a dang clue when i get them.
Various events can take place depending on what ducks you have on hand. I got an achievement for getting a floaty popped by the pool. Do I know how? Heck no i don't, why? Cuz I was doing NOTHING. 
Now even YOU can do nothing by yourself or with friends ONLINE! This game is nuts and I live for it. Its great for making you sleepy, or for those moods that you have no clue what game you wanna play. Just watch DUCKS!!
Even includes some nice background music to enjoy, however it does have some questionable ones, mainly on the first level where the relaxing music turns to either 1 of 2 odd tracks. 1 being just a lotta Spanish outta nowhere. The other being a deep voice also speaking some not-English language. 
We always got youtube if the music is less desired.

The gameplay is best described as follows:
You are watching a pool. Once in a while a new random non-sentient, uncontrollable rubberduck from the game's collection enters the pool by falling from the sky. The next duck will take slightly longer to appear and will fall in the exact same position as all its predecessors. After hitting the pool, the ducks will act 'naturally' in the pool in accordance to their material attributes and will go with the flow of their environment and possibly interact with other ducks as they may have features that can influence the other ducks once they happen to encounter each other.

You can anthropomorphize your ducks by giving them clever names and imaginary personalities; pick favorites and anticipate their behaviors. 

The game feels unpolished and unoptimized at times. Glitching and visual flickering isn't rare, but considering this game was made on a very small production-scale it's a good experience that is being taken care of by its developer. 

You do not play this game; it's a fun screensaver that interacts with your creativity.

But it's completely worse than what I had imagined, and what I would call un-usable at the moment. Having the correct number of ducks, having the few keys that exist work, and not having the game somehow run when it's closed are all things I just can't accept. 


Not a lot of explanation as to what is supposed to happen, which caused a lot of headache at the start. I believe when two ducks touch, they turn into a duck they've touched? It made me think one of my ducks went missing. And one of my ducks a separate time actually Did go missing. As in I had 5 ducks then suddenly I only had 4 and could only tab through 4 ducks total. I never figured out why. Also, while I am glad the controls cheat-sheet is easy to find again, it doesn't cover every key you need to play (or I got completely glitched, as I never actually found a solution). For example, I put the camera into a chair to watch the ducks from the chair, and I could not get out of the chair no matter what key I clicked or anything. I don't remember exactly how I got out of it, but I think an achievement went off or something special that just unlocked the camera for me because I remember suddenly the camera was on a specific duck and after that I could tab through them like normal. (Whatever it was, it was different than the aesthetic AFK video because it stayed on this one duck until I manually moved to the next duck, where the AFK video moves camera positions a lot.)

Also, definitely glitchy! Both visual glitches, which are acceptable, but not helping its case. But also keys not working correctly. And, the game-breaker for me was the music randomly started playing 20 hours after I last played! The game was not open at all (I had closed out of it completely using the 'save and quit' or whatever equivalent button there was in-game. The game wasn't in Task Manager when I looked after the music started, and I know for certain it was Closed, not just minimized)! I had to force Steam closed and restart the computer to make the music shut off! Not only did it terrify me, but it's simply not acceptable to have my normal day be interrupted by at random by a game that's not even open.",1696537862,1696537862,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

But in all seriousness, it's a game where ducks spawn in a pool and you can choose to spectate them. A duck spawns every 10 minutes or so. Sometimes a ship sails past and you can get an achievement. Multiplayer is a thing too, you and your friend can sit and watch the same pool together. Currently have abount 520 ducks and 9fps lol

everything has started so innocent
i just launched the game and started to watch what will happen
one duck came after another
but that wasnt enough
i knew i needed more
i bought all of the dlcs and played them too
but still that was not enough
i bought 20 irl plastic ducks
i placed them all over my flat
they watch me play, they watch me eat, they watch me sleep
they became a part of my life
and each of them became a part of me
now i am one with the plastic ducks
i cannot imagine my life without them now
i need them as much as they need me

Okay game - not bad but you can skip it or try on sale.
See my profile for more details about my reviews.

Additional notes: can't believe I will add to the Overwhelmingly Positive bandwagon... but yeah, I can't really downvote it either. I have to be very clear though: understand that this is NOT a game. This is not a video game, this is... art. Not in its purest form, but it definitely is some kind of art installation you would find at a museum from a hipster artist, with some clever (but a bit pretentious) ideas in it, for sure... but this is not a video game, you will not PLAY it, make sure of that before buying. This is a glorified screensaver. And while I would roll my eyes at that in a museum, as a virtual/digital creation? I get the idea... it's very cute and tongue in cheek funny. Often it is hard with these hipster creations to know the limit between making fun of something/not taking yourself seriously... and actually being/doing it for real. I would have honestly wished for MUCH, MUCH more interaction between the ducks, like making EACH of them unique in their sound, their action, their interaction etc. Waiting for a ufo abduction or a punctured flamingo felt somehow underwhelming after so many hours of patience...
So, as it is? meh, it's ok, after 12 hours letting it run, I am fine. Might buy the dlcs one day if they make a sale at 1 buck the whole thing, as a symbolic gesture towards the effort of making it... but that is about it. Fine! Take your thumbs up and go, I have real games to play now.",1695421632,1695421632,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

When I first got this game I thought it was a very simple game: collect a few ducks float around and that's it. however as my ducks slowly grew larger and larger and I acquired more and more. I then started looking around and realized that this world of the Ducks that we choose to be a part of is more than just some plastic ducks floating on a pool. It was a Great Awakening of sorts and I have devoted my time and effort to obtaining every duck physically possible. I never thought that they'll be such Connections in this game that take a spiritual and deeper meaning into oneself and the understanding that the Ducks are the reason we are all here today and that without the Placid plastic ducks I would have never experienced such greatness such as exploding ducks, fire ducks, burning ducks, Ducks being put out by other ducks, ducks flying and getting themselves stuck in a place that I didn't even know was possible, and of course duck. With that being said, What I  originally thought was a waste of $8 was $8 well spent.

Never played these sorts of games before, and I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but I bought it anyway since it's under 2 euros and saw a lot of positive reviews. 

The reviews were not joking. This game is genuinely brilliant. It's surprisingly intricate, there were a lot of unexpected reactions and events between the ducks that made this game so much funnier and enjoyable. Bought it for my boyfriend instantly as well so we can AFK collect rubber ducks together. It's great to leave this game just play in the background, do it's own thing, let UFO's steal your ducks, or the ducks fly off on their own into the ocean while you do something else. There is surprisingly a lot of attention to detail.

The graphics are great, ambient is really good, and the ducks are absolutely adorable.

10/10 get it for yourself even if it's not on sale. I genuinely love this game.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once upon a time, in a pool, there placidly floated several plastic ducks. These ducks were especially placid that day, as the yellow ducky Tomathan had recently given birth to three beautiful children: Unnamed Child 1, Unnamed Child B, and Unnamed Child 4. One day, however, Tomathan visited the private pool. Whether it was for a business meeting, to visit family, simply a vacation, or something else entirely, we simply don't know. However, we do know that he left his children in the upper pool. This is when something utterly horrible occurred. Despite the disco ball duck's best attempt to block it, the natural enemy of the plastic duck, the flamingo floatie, had entered the pool... Right on top of the children! This would have caused all three to be captured in the flamingo's donut shaped center, had the leopard duck not launched itself from the tube slide at the children just in time to knock two out of the way. However, one was left behind. When Tomathan returned to discover one of his children trapped, he was understandable horrified. He tried to free his child be nudging the flamingo, but that only made things worse, as he caused the floatie to block the slide to the private pool. Withing minutes, every single duck was in the upper, public pool, crowding it to they point that they could hardly move. Yet, amidst the chaos, a hero arose: Knife duck. Knife duck, using his mystical power of... knife, was able to pop the flamingo duck, not only saving the child, but the entire community! And so, while the ducks could never return to their placid ways, as they had never left their placid ways, they did become slightly less overcrowded.

Not so much a ""game"" as it is an idle collect-athon. However there are several secrets throughout offering a surprising amount mystery. It's a relaxing game to have on in the background. 

[h1]What I Liked[/h1]
I got addicted to uncovering and naming each and every duck. The design of many ducks was really creative and each offered something of a gimmick. For instance, the magma duck would set nearby things ablaze while the firefighter duck would spew water around and put out fires. It was fun uncovering what each could do. 

The music was chill and relaxing. 

[h1]What Could Be Improved[/h1]
I floundered with the camera controls at first. There are very limited options to interact with the game world. You basically can just tab between available ducks or 2 -3 fixed view spots for each location. The mouse has to be ""unlocked"" in order to click on anything. Controller support was negligible. 

[h1]Final Thoughts & Rating[/h1]
It's a very relaxing experience listening to the music and collecting new ducks. Usually I'd play this while doing other things. But it's pretty much a lightly interactive screensaver. I'd only recommend if your into achievement hunting or idle collection based games.

With the multiplayer my stream co-host was able to connect to the game and name the ducks as chat was suggesting names but it did disconnect her a few times. It was a lot of fun and I highly recommend any streamer looking for something relaxing to do with your chat this is it. I played it once already by myself for video content but the video got corrupted due to errors on my end i was surprised how simple this game is ended up being so fun to play,1692537147,1692537147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

QUACK QUACK!"" which means something very rude in duck language.[/spoiler]The game features intense lore, and I'm still waiting for Game Theory to make an episode about it.This game is incredible.The graphics are great.The story is amazing.This is the end of my review, thank you for reading it.(2/23/2023 edit: i have played an additional 18 hours now, and i stand by my review. you should 100% buy this game!)(3/14/2023 edit: i have played even more stuff and i still recommend it 101%!!!(3/25/2023 edit: i have played another 3.8 hours and i still recommend this game! you should 102% buy this game!!!)",1675111314,1692482977,True,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

We named every duck, we created lore for all the events, we laughed at every easter egg, and we cried as propeller duck disappeared into the great beyond. Everytime someone new entered the vc, they would always ask ""soooo, whats the objective in this game?"" and we'd all ask ""is this not enough?"" They eventually stopped asking questions and joined us in the hype of this game! Some of my friends even bought the game and live streamed their own perspectives in the same call!

I will definitely be playing more of this silly, peaceful, and addictive game, and you know I will be buying the DLC's! The only reason I haven't bought them yet is because I was too busy watching ducks! Silly reviews and memes aside, this game was super enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone and everyone!

As a connoisseur of fine feathered entertainment, I must admit I was initially skeptical about Placid Plastic Duck Simulator. I mean, a game centered around a plastic duck? But let me tell you, dear puddle companions, this game has completely flipped my webbed world upside down ‚Äì in the best possible way!

From the moment I waddled into the virtual pond, I was greeted by a symphony of cheerful quacks and a stunning plastic paradise that would make even the most aloof mallard weak in the knees. The attention to detail is bill-tastic; every ripple on the water's surface, every leaf that floats by, it's all so eerily reminiscent of my real pond, yet delightfully surreal.

The gameplay, my fellow flappers, is where the magic truly happens. I've never experienced such a heart-pounding adrenaline rush as I did when I engaged in the daring pursuit of plastic insect consumption. The physics of nibbling on those crunchy critters are astonishingly accurate ‚Äì I felt like I was truly feasting on the finest digital delicacies.

And let's not overlook the social dynamics at play. The way I smoothly glided across the water, striking up conversations with fellow plastic waterfowl, was a triumph of digital duck diplomacy. Whether we were discussing the latest pond gossip or competing in the Quacklympics (yes, you read that right), every interaction left me feeling like the suavest duck in the pixelated pond.

In conclusion, Placid Plastic Duck Simulator has transformed my perception of gaming. It's not just a game, it's a quack-tastic journey of self-discovery, social bonding, and the pursuit of the ultimate plastic duck enlightenment. So, fellow webbed wanderers, if you're ready to dive headfirst into the most audaciously absurd and feather-ruffling experience of your life, grab your virtual beak and join me in the extraordinary world of Placid Plastic Duck Simulator! ü¶ÜüéÆ",1671901980,1691785293,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

It's so frustrating to see a duck just laying on the deck because it got yeeted by one of the mechanisms out of the water. Why can't I pick up the duck and put it back in the water? Is that really such a huge ask? (That brings to mind the stone ducks‚ÄîI wish I could set them gently on the side, or in a shallow area so they weren't just stuck on the bottom the whole time.)
I do also wish there was a free cam option, so I could just look around without orbiting a single duck and then colliding with the deck and zooming in uncontrollably.
I also am a little puzzled by the choice of a manual save mechanic. AFAIK the only thing being saved is the number and types of ducks unlocked on the level, so it seems a bit odd that it requires a manual save. I would expect that as soon as a new duck spawns, the save could be refreshed automatically. It's not like there's an obscene number of variables that need their state stored to reproduce a massive world state (like Skyrim or such).

Gripes aside, the game is enjoyable, particularly for passing time. The unique duck sounds are a treat (though I feel this aspect was not fully ""realized""). The sheer variety of designs is impressive and I look forward to collecting even more ducks until there's not a drop of water left not occupied by a duck.",1690809382,1690809382,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly this game is one of the best walking simulator/mmo/rogue-like I've ever seen or played

As a Souls-like game, it revolutionised the genre and it cured my generational cancer.

It made me experience every kind of emotion that ever existed since the birth of human kind. This game is truly a master piece and deserves to be the Number 1 best seller in the history of Steam.

The fact that this game is only 3$ and can rivalize some AAA games like Peggle shows that the creators really took time and developed this game and the environment that can be explored through countless hours of playtime. 

At first glance, Placid Plastic Duck Simulator might seem absurd‚Äîcontrolling a plastic duck in various settings sounds like an odd concept. However, it is precisely this unique premise that sets the game apart from others in the genre. The initial moments of gameplay are surprisingly enjoyable, and it's easy to get immersed in the role of a floating plastic duck in a serene pond or bustling city fountain. The mechanics  of this game might seem simple to grasp to the unfamiliar eye, however, they are surprisingly deep and complex for someone colourblind or a League Of Legends player.

This game offered me salvation from my dark past, it cured my racism and helped me develop a functioning brain as-well as human decency. It made me learn what a shower was and it truly turned my life around for the better. 

In conclusion,  i recommend this game because it's better that rehab and the fog is coming. Enjoy your time.

Edit: I forgot to tell you about the deep lore this game contains. Honestly there are pages upon pages of lore and it's so captivating and intriguing.It distracted me from the voices in my head and now i'm saving 50$ of schizophrenia meds every week. Beware however, you might forget that time flows and end up 7 years into the future without realising. I suggest playing with consideration and carefully watching the time. Also the party duck is a terrorist nothing anyone says can change that fact",1690502026,1690502548,True,43,8,0.691312253475189209,2,True,False,False

This game is a misunderstood gem that currently needs to get the recognition it deserves.

But you may wonder, why is it supposedly so good? Well, then I will answer your question. Placid Plastic Duck is about some ducks in a swimming pool and it's true, this may seem very boring, but that would only be judging a book by its cover.

In the game you start with a duck in the pool, you will not be able to move it, since it moves by itself and you will only be able to see it from outside or get in the first person, after a while every few minutes another duck will arrive and another and another... Until you have more ducks than days in the sun.

In Placid Plastic Duck you can fulfill your fantasy of having a gigantic number of ducks, being able to have them of different rarities, patterns and colors, in addition to the fact that there are some that can interact with each other and this not only happens with the ducks from the base game, but also with those of the dlcs.

As an experienced player with all the achievements I have witnessed many interactions, there is a duck with a candle that can burn an ice cube to unlock an easter duck (sorry for the joke) and yes, you read that right, there are SECRET ducks, there are several ducks that They can be obtained in the normal map and other secrets that are from the other dlc map, like these there are many interactions, such as a ninja duck that you have to find hidden or a duck that has to capture a ghost duck on camera.

Placid Plastic Duck are not just ducks, they are THE ducks you want to have, you have many types and each one can be more or less to your liking, this game accompanied by its own music can help you relax while you study or finish a job, this game , is what YOU NEED.",1685416436,1689738975,True,60,0,0.841901659965515137,1,True,False,False

Save for some achievements/duck, there is no input required - in fact, all you can do is just watch ducks. Some of ducks do have special interaction if you use Quack button, but that's it.

That being said however, it's honestly one of most games I find easy to chill to, hell I like having it on background as I browse internet and talking with people. It's fun to see what ducks are up to. Like a duck wielding a knife who blew up the puddle toy, a duck that's on fire (I named it ""I'M ON FIRE"") and... yeah. It's cute.

At the asking price I thought it was great value. Just keep in mind there's little to no gameplay but if the idea of watching ducks floating around sounds nice, then I can recommend it.",1689721351,1689721351,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

I`m sorry but I had to refund this one because of that.

In every duck you see, there is personality, individuality, and perhaps even aspirations. Yet, in their buoyant existence they find futility: unable to choose their destination, forever surrendered to the elements. We watch over them like deities indulging in the mysteries of their futures. In spite of life's indifference and disconnect from our influence, they float along. From slipping down a slide to being abducted by UFOs, their rubber remains resilient from the wake of their existence. They float along, no matter what. From their journey, we can derive what it means to be alive: to press on against the waves that crash against us, continuing on in spite of however cruel the world around us is or however lost we are. We are here. We are alive and in the now, to see our own paths follow through wherever they lead. Thus, we can find solace in solemnity. This is not a game.

My Steam Deck can run DOOM Eternal at 900p at around 50-40 FPS, meanwhile this game struggles to run 720p @ 30 FPS. No doubt this is partially due to the fact that it has NO graphics settings other than resolution and v-sync. No shadows, water detail, anti-aliasing, post-processing, no settings like that, and it seems the game is just capped at Ultra settings. 

Furthermore, it even runs the CPU hard. HOW? You don't even play the game, it's basically an advanced screensaver. What is the CPU [i]doing[/i]? Are the physics that advanced? Is it running 500 iterations per frame? It's inexcusable, really.

I wanna like this game because it is charmingly simple and not very expensive, but when neither of my computers can run the game at a good resolution at even 30 FPS, it doesn't matter how little the game costs, it's not worth it.

The sheer unbridled joy that I just feel playing something so calm, peaceful and inoffensive for so long feels so good.

They are just plastic ducks floating around in a pool in the middle of nowhere, but that‚Äôs all they need to be. I can‚Äôt explain why, but this came just makes me so emotional. These are just creatures living their lives, floating around on an endless pool and it‚Äôs beautiful. I am overcome with emotion I don‚Äôt fully understand. Like watching a movie you don‚Äôt understand but it makes you cry‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt fully make sense of it, all you know is that it makes you feel so good.
Especially after how much time I‚Äôve sunk into games like just cause 3, GTA V, GTA online and Fallout 4, it‚Äôs just so jarringly calming to play something with no guns, no action, no drugs, no violence, no objectives, just sitting and smiling in a void of placid plastic ducks floating with no destination in mind.",1687897089,1687897089,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A Zamboni without a driver pushes past me, moving the others to the gondola lift. I do not know if it chose to ignore me or if it just missed. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever know. 

There‚Äôs a lot of things I‚Äôll never know. Who I am, for example. I know what I am, but I don‚Äôt know what I look like. I‚Äôm a duck, a rubber duck to be exact. The others are too‚Äîthey slide past me, sometimes float past me, if we‚Äôre in water‚Äîand they wear all sorts of colors and designs.

All I know for certain is that I quack sometimes, seemingly at random. I can‚Äôt control it; it just happens.

I don‚Äôt think the others are aware, like I am. I think I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs really here. In a sense, I‚Äôm alone...and yet I‚Äôm not. 

Someone else is here. It‚Äôs not one of the ducks. It‚Äôs something else entirely, a different sort of entity. They‚Äôve never done anything to any of us, but I sense their presence. I know they‚Äôre here. I can feel them. But all they do is watch. 

Am I happy with this life? I can‚Äôt say. I can‚Äôt remember anything else. As far as I know, I‚Äôve always been a rubber duck.

It could be worse. Some of the others catch fire. Some of them fly off the mountain, never to be seen again. I‚Äôve even seen one explode. Me? I just float endlessly, without a care in the world. Nothing to do. No need for food. For money. 

But it could be better. If there was just one other duck here, aware, like I am... Would that be better? Would it be better to have someone like me, even if we couldn‚Äôt communicate? I guess I‚Äôll never know.

It‚Äôs getting dark. Darker than nighttime, that is. So dark that I can‚Äôt see, not even the warm glow of fire that is always burning. But this is normal.

From the very moment I embarked on this extraordinary journey, I was transported to a realm of tranquility and contemplation unlike any other. In this review, I humbly attempt to convey the profound impact this game has had on my life.

Placid Plastic Duck Simulator offers an unprecedented gaming experience by defying conventional controls and embracing the simplicity of being a floating plastic duck. At first glance, one might question the absence of traditional gameplay mechanics. However, it is precisely this absence that allows the true essence of the game to shine through.

From the very first moment, as I gracefully floated on the serene surface of the virtual pond, a profound sense of peace washed over me. The absence of controls brought a newfound freedom, untethering my spirit from the constraints of traditional gaming conventions. As I glided effortlessly through the digital water, I was unburdened by objectives or tasks, and instead, I surrendered myself to the captivating beauty of my surroundings.

The attention to detail in Placid Plastic Duck Simulator is simply astonishing. The meticulously crafted environments, filled with lush vegetation and shimmering sunlight, create an enchanting atmosphere that embraces players in a cocoon of serenity. Each ripple, each subtle reflection, and every gentle breeze contribute to an immersive symphony of tranquility.

Every session reveals new discoveries and invites profound introspection. The game acts as a mirror, encouraging players to reflect upon their own lives, desires, and the simplicity of being. It serves as a gentle reminder to slow down, appreciate the present moment, and find solace in the beauty that surrounds us.

The ethereal soundtrack of Placid Plastic Duck Simulator further elevates the experience to a spiritual level. Delicate melodies and soothing harmonies perfectly complement the mesmerizing visuals, amplifying the sense of peace and contemplation. The combination of visuals and audio creates a sensory masterpiece, leaving players in a state of blissful harmony.

In conclusion, Placid Plastic Duck Simulator is a groundbreaking masterpiece that defies the conventions of traditional gaming. Its lack of controls paradoxically grants players unparalleled freedom and immersion. This extraordinary game has taught me to appreciate the simplicity of existence, to find solace in the quiet moments, and to embrace the beauty that can be found in the mundane.

Like many people raising/caring for kids these days, it's a constant struggle to foster a healthy relationship with devices. It's really easy to just let a kid loose on a tablet, especially when you are tired or preoccupied. But as we've all seen, too much freedom/access can affect a kids social and emotional development. (iPad kids, Elsagate, Cocomelon, ect.). I struggled with getting my siblings to engage in activities off-devices or even listen to me talk when something is on in the background. 

[b] But in comes Placid Plastic Ducks! [/b]

Almost immediately after unwrapping gifts on Christmas, the kids wanted to go on their devices. Slightly hurt, and not about to let the expensive and thoughtful toys go to waste, we denied them. But yet again we arrived at the predicament; in 10 minutes they'd ask again or risk putting a movie on in the background that will steal their attention away. I struggle with keeping my attention on a given task and typically find something simple on in the background helps me tremendously. (A podcast, How its Made, ect.). PPD helped me a bunch, so why don't I try it with the kids?

Placid Plastic Ducks was an instant hit. With PPD on in the background and some music playing (not in game, sorry), the kids played with their toys all day. The next morning, while preparing breakfast, they begged me to turn the ducks back on and focus on the Submarine Duck or Impostor Duck. When they did get to go on devices, they were respectful when time was up and quickly found something else to do while watching ducks. I can't tell you how much of a relief it was to see this work so well. It has saved us so many headaches and tears. I buy each DLC immediately upon release and thoroughly enjoy the creativity and intrigue.

Downside? It makes my pc run way hotter than I'd like. I have a fairly young Razer laptop and it gets really toasty after about 15 minuets of running the game. Overwatch takes much longer to get just as warm. I imagine it runs so hot because of the graphics or amount of the quackers, but it is very discouraging, as I don't want my laptop acting like a space heater, and is the main reason I don't keep the game running on my second monitor all day.

But seriously, for the price it's wonderful. It's a very silly little game but there's an almost hypnotic charm to watching the ducks idly bounce and bob along the water (or sink in some occasions). For the $2 price tag of the game I've EASILY gotten several hours of enjoyment out of watching the ducks go about their merry way. My friend has also continually sent me the new dlc each time it was released which just ever-expanded the amount of enjoyment.

While some would call this a ""boring"" game, I would say, that's correct, but a better term fort this, should be ""Serene."" I would love to have my own pool to watch ducks float around in. Now I have aspirations. Thank you Game Developers, I truly felt as placid as the game advertised. 10/10.

Note To Devs: Consider adding a bigger Beach in the background, and Putting a Giant Sand Castle on it with some seashells by the seashore. . Would love to see that in an update, as well as maybe controls for the ducks, maybe a push mechanic, though if you left it as it is, I would have no issue. Maybe consider creating a live desktop app that mimics the game. On top of this, maybe add more radio stations and the opportunities to tune the radio. That'd be pretty cool, but I did enjoy the vaporwave tunes, and the occasional Mexican Commercial. 

Thank you for this lovely game.

EDIT: Downloaded all of the DLCs as of 6-6-23. and it Tripled My Enjoyment. Disco Duck is my favorite. Thank you Again Game Devs.",1686057276,1686060204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead‚Äì murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time ‚Äì something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange ‚Äì uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" ‚Äì on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have
often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",1685387043,1685387043,True,3,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

One might think that this game would be like any other Simulator game out there. ""It's just another idle game"" or ""why'd you waste money on this"" is two common questions you or your friends might ask about this game. But trust me when I'm telling you that this game has it all! Action, surprises, advanced mechanics, easter eggs and now the obvious thing that perfects it all, the multiplayer function. Trust me when i say that you won't be disappointed.

Some random encounters and the ability to name each unique duck rounds out the experience. This is the kind of game for people that like to watch logs burn in campfires, honeybees, and similar experiences where you are a simple observer. It has enough charm and effort put in to be more than a simple Unity prank game. Buy depending on how much you enjoy watching things float in a pool.",1684207699,1684207699,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There's more to it than that, but that is the very basic essence of it. There are mini events that randomly occur; planes fly by, curious little UFOs appear to steal a duck away into the night (this literally happened in the background as I was writing this section, thanks game), inflatable pool decorations get popped or knocked in depending on what your ducks do as they float around.

It is absolutely something you put on in the background/a second monitor, or if you want to have passive entertainment while doing something else. I fell asleep with it running, and as someone who has sleeping problems, it was nice to look over after a routine night of randomly waking up from poor sleep to see the ducks still bein' ducks without a care in the world, drifting around on my monitor.

Also a UFO came back and spat out a completely unrelated duck while I was typing this. Not sure what to make of that.

The music in the game is nice, although there's not a lot of it. You have probably ~20-30 minutes of music from the in-game radio that will loop. It's very good, but there isn't enough of it, even though it absolutely fits that mellow vibe of ""yeah, the rest of the world kinda sucks, but we're just ducks enjoying what we got.""

I had a good upbringing, supportive family and friends, and a decent job. But despite all of that, I found myself feeling empty, unmotivated, and constantly tired. It was a struggle just to get out of bed each morning.

I tried therapy, medication, and even meditation, but nothing seemed to work. That was until I stumbled upon a game called Placid Plastic Duck Simulator. At first, I was skeptical. How could a game about plastic ducks possibly help with my depression? But I was desperate and willing to try anything.

As soon as I started playing, I was hooked. The premise of the game was simple ‚Äì you controlled a plastic duck in a pond there was something about the game that was so calming and peaceful. The sound of the water, the gentle movements of the duck, and the simple objectives all combined to create an environment that was almost meditative.

At first, I only played for a few minutes at a time, but as I became more engrossed in the game, I found myself playing for hours on end. It became my go-to activity whenever I was feeling down or anxious. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I would pull up the game and immerse myself in the world of the plastic duck.

As I played, I noticed something changing within me. I was no longer consumed by negative thoughts or anxiety. Instead, I was focused on the game and the sense of accomplishment I felt when I collected a new duck. The game became a source of positive reinforcement, something I desperately needed in my life.

I also began to feel more connected to others through the game. I discovered an online community of players who shared tips and strategies for the game. We would chat about our experiences and bond over our shared love for Placid Plastic Duck Simulator. It was a sense of camaraderie I had not felt in a long time.

Over time, I began to realize that the game was not a cure for my depression, but rather a tool that helped me manage it. Playing Placid Plastic Duck Simulator did not erase my problems or magically make me happy, but it provided me with a respite from the daily struggle of depression. It gave me a sense of control, accomplishment, and connection.

Now, whenever I feel myself slipping back into a depressive episode, I know I can turn to Placid Plastic Duck Simulator for comfort. It is a reminder that there are moments of calm and joy in life, even when things seem bleak. And for that, I will always be grateful to the simple game about a plastic duck in a pond.",1683770022,1683770221,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There is nothing to really excuse my hrs on record playing the game, but I would say for the price, fantastic thing to have in the background while you work on other tasks, the chill beats, the ambient sounds, the random quacks as the camera zips from duck to duck, all with unique designs that make them appealing to watch float  in your pool. 
Oh there he goes down the slide, that is adorable!
Calling this a game is somewhat unfair, as its not trying to be. Almost all the achievements require no action from the player, nor is the player able to do anything other than move from spot to spot. Leave the game on long enough, and your achievement list will be full sooner or later.
The pool areas that are available are very beautiful, with lots of hidden details and random events that occur on both, somewhat guaranteeing you entertainment every time you glance back at the duck pool.
Oh my duck just got abducted by aliens. And they replaced it with an alien duck. Neat.

There is not really a point to anything you do here, and you can get some added dlc that is also very cheap, and has a lovely ammount of ducks, with unique mechanics and attention to detail leaving me satisfied with the pricing. But they do add up eventually in cost.
There is also the issue of lack of settings, the resolution being changed does not really help lower end systems, and having too many ducks can prove for a very lag filled experience, without the ability to lower the settings to compensate. 
With the unlocked ability to mess with the radio, I was also hoping for some more music variety, but I was sad to find out not really much else.
Some of the dlc has added some more active achievements, but they do not add up to much more than clicking on stuff. There are also some hidden... lore bits? Alternate reality game hints? That were fun to figure out, and I got a cool new duck for it!

Overall, It is a very fun idle experience to check back on while doing other things, the duck designs are fantastic, the interactions between them and the environment are full of attention to detail, with only a few minor flaws. Wonderful execution of the interactive screen saver concept.",1683482651,1683484190,True,35,0,0.78191685676574707,0,True,False,False

1999360,137895063,76561198311827683,0,1,131,0,127,1683651656,"3 weeks ago I was lucky enough to gaze upon the well renowned and incredibly sophisticated Machu Picchu on a visit to the stunning Andes Mountains in Peru. Whilst I stood high above the Urubamba River valley, below all I could do was merely attempt to take in the surrounding unmatched panoramic views and marvel at its intrinsically designed buildings and dry-stone walls, this was something I was sure would forever remain as the greatest sight the world could possibly hold. Other sites like the Effel Tower, City of Petra or even something as grand as the Taj Mahal whilst stunning in their own respective right just did not live up to such beauty and ingenuity nor made me feel anything like what I felt standing in that sacred Peruvian Valley. I truly felt that I would never feel this way again but recently have been lucky enough to have such a feeling reemerge from the depths of my consciousness when I was introduced to the peaceful but also strangely sorrowful world of Placid Duck Simulator.

Within a few minutes of game play everything in the world of Placid Plastic Duck Simulator was laid out before me yet the journey and better yet the destination still lay far beyond my vision and surrounded by a thick fog of what I could describe as a duck-less void or uncertainty. Yet despite this I always felt at ease, I may not have known what I was doing here or if I even had a purpose in this world in the first place but I somehow knew that everything would be alright regardless of what might happen on the journey I was about to depart on, a journey I might add I was anything but prepared for.
I would find myself peacefully exploring the depths of a suburban swimming pool at first only to thrust into the swirling unconscious grasp of a slide headed towards the unknown only then to find another duck waiting for me. What challenges I would be faced with I won't go into too much detail about as I truly believe this is a game you don't want spoiled but from fighting the chilling frozen weather above the mountains to even battling the forces of an extraterrestrial race from beyond our very own understanding of the universe itself I was never devoid of excitement and danger across my journey. The unchallenged sorrow I felt as I watched one of my most beloved ducks fall from atop of mountain to a almost certain death below still haunts my soul to this day as I could only watch helpless as they were tossed aside by the cruel hands of fate to a brutal demise. It is moments like these that truly make this game feel like so much more than just another piece of media and almost like a reflection world and its many experiences instead.

It is rare for critics like myself to find ourselves in a position where we struggle to find criticism of something that is to be reviewed whether it be a film, television series, food dish, etc as we owe so love finding and writing about it. More so seeing things that have flaws or are not perfect almost give us a feeling of superiority over them as highlighting ones weaknesses is often far easier than analysing their strengths and then learning from them as we as people often prefer to think of ourselves as already better than those around us and therefore not needing of improvement ourselves and instead more suited to picking out the faults we see in our surrounding environment that help reinforce this sense of perfection in our own lives. Yet the truth simply put is that all of these things we see in our everyday life are far more perfect then we give them credit for and the faults we see in them are often just a reflection of the faults from our own lives and selves that we have blinded ourselves from spotting.

Placid Plastic Duck Simulator showed me many things but best of all it showed me a reflection of myself flaws included and allowed me to find through an array of ducks that my destination whilst clouded never really mattered at all. It pointed out that my journey too simply put was not at all obvious and often spiraled out of control yet this didn't matter at all as what mattered was my effect on the ducks or people I met along the way. The destination was never reached on my journey but that never mattered for me as the ducks I met along the way made the journey worth all the more anyway. We may feel powerless to change our own course in life and often feel like we can't change the courses of others either but if I have learnt anything from the world of Placid Plastic Duck Simulator its that our course in life and journeys are constantly being written and evolving. They aren't just effecting our own lives but the lives of all those who surround us and sometimes bad things have to happen to some ducks (people) for good things to happen to others who at the time need it more.

I shall be watching the developer ""turbolento games"" closely in future and eagerly await what they attempt at applying themselves to next.

I would spend hours at the casino, pouring all my savings into the slot machines and roulette tables. I couldn't help myself - the rush of adrenaline that came with each bet was addictive, and I found myself unable to resist the lure of easy money.

My friends and family had tried to intervene, but nothing seemed to work. I was in deep, and I didn't see a way out.

That is, until I discovered the Placid Duck Simulator.

At first, I thought it was just another silly game - a simulation where you controlled a virtual duck floating on a serene pond. But as I played, something remarkable happened. I felt my anxiety levels start to drop. My heart rate slowed. And the more I played, the more relaxed and centered I felt.

I started playing the Placid Duck Simulator every day, instead of going to the casino. And slowly but surely, my addiction began to lose its hold on me.

As I continued to play, I found myself drawn to the calm, peaceful atmosphere of the game. I enjoyed watching the duck glide gracefully through the water, and listening to the soothing sounds of nature. And as I focused on the game, my mind became clearer and more focused.

Eventually, I was able to quit gambling altogether. I no longer felt the need for the rush of adrenaline that came with each bet. Instead, I found that the simple pleasures of life - like spending time with my family, or taking a walk in the park - were more than enough to bring me joy.

Looking back on my journey, I realize that the Placid Duck Simulator was more than just a game. It was a powerful tool that helped me overcome my addiction and find peace in my life. And for that, I will always be grateful.",1682855465,1682855465,True,2,1,0.540636062622070313,0,True,False,False

In all seriousness, this game is a delightful idle game with nice (albeit strange) lo-fi music.  The charming visuals carry this game to a level far above its price point.  You just watch ducks fall into a pool and float around.  The diversity of duck that could drop at any moment as the meter fills creates an odd feeling of tension, followed by a rush of delight once it appears from nowhere.  It's the same feeling as a gatcha game, but without the monetary investment.  With all the DLC, there's nearly (if not more than) 100 ducks total, and seeing them all in the pool is quite the treat.

Some ducks have special interactions with each other.  The afro-touting duck will spin when near the disco ball duck at night, and so on.  These interactions help keep the game interesting, so I won't spoil too many of them.  There's also a bit of a mystery pertaining to the metal door in the background, and it's strange ties to 2 particular ducks...

But there are not just ducks! All maps till now has some misteries around them, no spoilers ahead. you'll understand when you play it.

You can beat all achievements in around 16 hours of relaxing gameplay or less.

It's kinda simple but so greatfull how the developers got so creativity on every edge from the ducks to the infinity oblivion of the maps.

Just relax and enjoy your DUCKS!!

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.
When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my ducks hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.
After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.
Having nothing better to do, I searched for a duck I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this duck and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the duck, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this duck a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the duck off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.
Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.
I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.
Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little duck helped me realize that.
Thank you

I bought this after a handful of my favorite streamers played it on stream. I've seen the dev pop into all of their streams at least once while the streamers had it running, which I thought was pretty cool. I really wanted to check things out myself instead of bugging the steamers to click this duck or look over that way. I get to zoom in & check out each duck myself. I really like it when I'm just chilling out, to relax before bed, or when I'm doing things like crosswords or reading a book. I've enjoyed getting the achievements as well.

There's only thing I wish would change. I'd to be able to start a new game where the collection starts over. Like you can't see the ducks on the collection page & can give them new names. I'd love to do different themes with collection names. Naming them is half the fun! Okay, maybe not half, but alotta fun for me.

Ok, there's a 2nd change I'd like to see: MORE DUCKIES!!! LoL I love all the different & unique ducks so much. I love that some have different abilities. It makes me want lots more. Or add in a few different aquatic creatures that drop & can be named just like the ducks.

I actually have a few ideas for both changes, & maybe a few other changes. But I'm far from being a developer or coder. I just have ideas. But yeah, I love this game so muc!",1682231956,1682231956,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Based on the title and ""beginning"" of the game, you may think it's what it advertises itself as- a silly, funny little premise that you'll play for about half an hour and then get bored of. However, there are so many little events, secrets easter eggs, and interactions between the different types of Ducks that it's kind of amazing. Even outside of making up your own little stories and plots about what your Ducks do, there's still so much this game has to offer.

The music and graphics are also surprisingly great for how cheap the game is, and even without the DLC there are plenty of Ducks to scratch that itch to complete your collection. Yeah, you can always just AFK and leave the game running, but then you miss out on all out of nowhere things that can happen like [spoiler]having a UFO appear and drop an NVIDIA PC Duck into my pool.[/spoiler]",1682118440,1682118440,True,23,1,0.754058897495269775,0,True,False,False

The attention to detail in this game is simply quack-tastic. From the realistic feather textures to the authentic quacking sounds, it's as if you're really holding a plastic duck in your hand. And let's not forget the breathtaking scenery - the bathtub has never looked so picturesque.

But what truly sets this game apart is the sheer excitement of it all. Who knew that simulating the movements of a plastic duck could be so thrilling? I found myself on the edge of my seat, eagerly anticipating the next wave that would rock my little duckie vessel.

It's a game that challenges the notion of what a video game should be, with its emphasis on minimalism and existential themes.

The game's dreamy 3D graphics and chill music set the stage for a tranquil and relaxing experience. The player is tasked with simply watching plastic ducks float around in various pools, while moving the camera around to explore different angles. There's no way to interact with the ducks, which may seem limiting at first, but ultimately drives home the game's themes of existentialism and the lack of control we have over the world around us.

The game's minor events, such as the two connected pools with a small height difference and the occasional slide that the ducks go down, add a sense of variety to the gameplay. But ultimately, the game is about accepting the lack of agency we have over the world, and finding peace in simply observing the ducks and their surroundings.

The custom types of ducks in the game each have different abilities and interact with each other in unique ways. However, players have to wait approximately five minutes for a new duck to spawn, which emphasizes the game's theme of patience and acceptance.

While Placid Plastic Duck Simulator may not be for everyone, it's a thought-provoking game that challenges players to consider their place in the world and the role they play in the grand scheme of things. It's a reminder that sometimes, it's okay to just sit back and observe, and that finding contentment in the world around us can be a source of profound peace and relaxation.

The dopamine you will get from watching these plastic ducks float around will be infinite, no mere words can describe the feelings of joy, terror and grief you will experience. These mere ""ducks"" are a force unknown to our world, so beautifull, so immense, so mysterious. The tiny amount of time I have used to experience this beauty of a ""game"" shows that even being there for such a short time makes you wonder what it means to be a duck or how to float around in life. This ""game"" is no mere game, it is an event, a grand ceremony for these placid plastic ducks to float around in life's water. This is the meaning of life, to watch to grow and to float around. If your worries are heavy, you will sink like the stone duck. May you have no worries at all, you will float away like the propeller hat duck. If you worry but not too much you will have a stable journey through life's challenges.

The Goofy Aspect is great. Its especially hilarious to explain it to friends and family. I streamed it in my discord server and put in chat ""totally not streaming rubber ducks"", only for friends to join the stream and become confused. It was highly amusing. I do not wish to spoil, but there are a few moments in the game that left me feeling amused and entertained. It is literally a rubber duck version of watching the icon bounce around the TV and I find that absolutely hilarious. 

The Relaxing Aspect is also great. Watching little cute rubber duckies float around in a pool, listening to the splash of water and the relaxing radio music is calming for me. If you don't like the music you can always disable it and play your own music while gaming or listen to podcasts/audiobooks/etc. Upon loading the game I almost immediately felt de-stressed and calm.

I hope more DLC worlds come in (as well as an official soundtrack), as the relaxing pool and relaxing snow den are wonderful places to just listen to their radios. Watching the ducks go down the slides is really relaxing, and I also love some of the random world events that cause the occasional drama. 

The sound ambiance in this game is beautiful, with relaxing waves/splashing and occasional quacking, with a radio on the main world which plays various relaxing mixes that are slightly ominous in tone, and various commentary from many radio hosts and showtunes in many languages. Russian(?), Japanese, English, reversed, and others play, allowing for a nice relaxing and surreal background noise for those who'd like it.

-Thinking names for ducks (HARD) 
-Trying to find best viewing place (IMPOSSIBLE) 
-Wondering why one duck (it knows who!!!!) wants to be a total rebel? 
-EMOTIONAL when duck fly out the pool (You will CRY)

The amount of Ducks you can get in the pool is incredible

The feeling of success was breathtaking, truly felt like a King.

Why shouldn‚Äôt I spend my cash on an actual game, like Vampire Survivors? (Because I already own Vampire Survivors. But you get the point.)

Here‚Äôs why: would you like as much heroin as you can possibly handle, with ZERO of the negative side effects?

Then watch iyashikei (‚Äúhealing‚Äù) anime like Yuru Camp, Non Non Biyori, Flying Witch, etc.

But also, buy this ‚Äúgame.‚Äù

The ducks gently and serenely bob up and down, like a luxury yacht on calm seas. Follow a duck, and your camera will gently bob up and down along with it. If you‚Äôve ever played a sailing game that made you motion sick, this is the exact opposite of that; play this to *stop* feeling motion sick, and start feeling as though you are being gently cradled into the tender bosom of a wondrous goddess of purest healing and love. (Yes, the aforementioned analogy is indeed about the camera movement. AAA-gaming industry, eat your heart out.)

But maybe that‚Äôs not your thing. Maybe you‚Äôd like to just chill in one of the comfiest chairs in existence, and watch your ducks serenely bob up and down, while you serenely remain stationary. Don‚Äôt worry: the dev has truly thought of everything.

And let‚Äôs not forget the slide, and the suction tube. If you thought that you couldn‚Äôt get dopamine hits from a game where you don‚Äôt really do anything, you probably never played with marbles. Or nature. But that‚Äôs okay, because now, you can look at ducks, which do marble-like things.

And oh, the ducks! I haven‚Äôt even started talking about the different ducks: as you have likely just surmised, there are indeed different ones. And you get a new one, every time! It‚Äôs like a gatcha machine, where you never lose! And you get to name them, and LOOK JUST BUY THIS GAME.

100% of the 98% Overwhelmingly Positive reviews sound like they were written by crazy people. Why? Because we probably are. So why not join us, and make it 99% Overwhelmingly Positive? Better than abusing actual heroin.",1680088033,1680247810,True,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

And the sheer variety of gameplay options is staggering. No matter what mood I was in, there was always something new and exciting to do in the Placid Plastic Duck Simulator.

I played it with my friends, and I recommend to try it as well. Of course if you have them.

If you look at this and ask yourself, ""It is just plastic ducks floating around?

Yes, at the core, it is just a bunch of plastic ducks floating around. Yes, it can be a pleasant relaxation, almost meditative type of experience. But can be so much more than that! You can some how form a bond with them and become invested in their well-being (No! Woody! Stay away from Lava! Why are you just bobbing there, Firefighter Duck?!) and create stories with them (those two are SO attracted to each other). Ducks become friends and rivals. New arrivals to the pool may turn out to be the life of the party or the bane of everyone's floating paradise. If you enjoy Sim games or tabletop role playing games, give this game 10 minutes.

Also, I cannot think of a more eloquent and well executed SIMPLE concept turned entertainment.

Not a lot to write about for Placid Plastic Duck Simulator. You're a plastic duck, in the middle of water, just bobbing and slowly drifting around. You get to quack at least, but I would've also liked it if you were to just move around a little. There's a nice assortment of rubber ducks to be found here, adds a little variety and character to the ducks themselves.

I wouldn't really expect a lot for a 'game' such as this. Some nifty quirky events happen like a duck will be abducted by an alien, they'll make their way through a tunnel and sometimes get set on fire. Other than that, yeah you can't expect a lot to happen since it'll be a while until things do happen.

The only takeaway from this game is that it has no right in taking up so many system resources, particularly the GPU, as it does. Task Manager tells me that this game takes 50% of the GPU with power consumption on High. I've had graphically demanding games take less, while a stupidly simple idle simulator such as this takes up a bit. I don't understand that and I don't think it'll be fixed ever.

I want a neutral button for this based on that, but I'll not recommend it for the hardware portion while I'll recommend it for the novelty factor.",1677713956,1677713956,False,13,1,0.562602698802947998,0,True,False,False

They began as strangers, but at time went by and the breeze in the summer sky changed, so did their circumstances; they were blown towards each other and it was love at first sight. They floated together for ages, rarely straying from one another. Even when they were apart, they always ended up reuniting with one another in a beautiful display of petroleum passion; things were perfect.

But then came another, one with a burning hatred for the life of lonliness he led. For though the pool was a world of joy and love, he felt none. Enraged, he began pursuing the two lovers, determined to make them feel the same pain that he had known for his isolated existance.

He set the wooden duck ablaze, the fire burning with the intensity of the jealousy of the relationship he yearned for, but could never have. It took only moments for the cloth duck to notice that their partner NAY, their very purpose of creation burning in agony and crying out to them. The cloth duck rushed to help, only to be ignited by the same destructive flames that now consumed the wooden one.

But neither would dare leave each other. for without one, the other could never be whole. So instead, they endured the pain, gazing into each other's eyes. Through the pain they felt as their plastic flesh became scorched, they endured. For the pain of living apart would be far worse than that of the flames.

They still float together, their dedication to each other brighter than even the most intense pool light, never to be snuffed out.

This is a neat little game to put on & relax to or to just check on here & there as it runs in the background. You don't need to do much just watch your pool's collection of rubber ducks grow(or shrink slightly since some escape into the sea). All you have to do is enjoy the scene & maybe switch between ducks or the pool chairs.

The rubber ducks are cute & have all sorts of odd/wild designs(WHO GAVE THAT THING A KNIFE). It's always interesting relaxing in the pool chair, wondering if the propeller hat one or the submarine one escaped before seeing a new duck join the party. The scenery also changes weather & stages of the day which can add for some great screenshots/photography moments especially at sunset. Also a few surprises pop up in the sea when in the base game's pool.


My only complaint is it gets a little buggy when you resume a save file as it lags a little then sends you to the game, sometimes if you accidentally/out of confusion click too many times the sky flickers between what you should see & black until the first duck lands. My first or second time resuming a saved game it crashed. I'm not sure if this has to do with the fact I'm on a laptop but aside from that it works fine.

Other than that I have no complaints & I'm happy to have bought this toy bird watching simulator. Will likely buy more duck DLC if it comes out.",1677459213,1677459213,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I saw a Twitch Steamer play this game and I bought it soon after and never regretted it. I am having such a blast just watch these Rubber Ducks intact with each other as hijinx ensue. Without spoiling much, some of the ducks have powers of the elements that then effect the other ducks. The best part is that you get to name them  whatever you want (As far as I know for the whatever you want part), so I can personal scrutinize the troublemakers in the pool. I am so glad now, with the latest update to date, there are now save files so I can watch these plastic ducks from the different locations without fear of losing all of my ""Rubber Duck Progress"". Music is alright. There is a radio that plays random gibberish and some tunes. Most of the time though I just lower the sound as I try to get some work done outside of my PC. The graphics are beautiful. You can see the finest of details on the rubber ducks and the water itself. The textures look so good. There is a dedicated ""Quack"" button... YES! So overall, this is what I call an idle ""game"". All you do is watch rubber ducks, and then some. This is not for everyone, but if you need something serine in the background while your computer is not in any use or you want to watch funny rubber ducks and hijinx all day, it's worth picking up. The game and the DLC are very affordable, especially for a well polished game and the multitude of ducks. 100% the game is literally just sit and watching ducks, although there are special ""Holiday Ducks"" that I think would only appear around Christmas, so that might be the hardest part of ""completing this game"".

I will say I adore this game, I even bought this for a friend who loves ducks.

I won't lie, I haven't put that many hrs into it, and I may wait as a result of there being no real graphics option, as a result its not very well optimized.

For $2 its a steal, but I  can't really recommend to anyone even with a somewhat decent pc. Optimization options is something that the game clearly needs, yet lacks despite the amazing additions being made to the game along with 3 DLCs.  I liked the idea so much I even got my friend a copy.

That's my only concern, if not for the lack of graphics options I would continue to play this game, but I feel like playing this at a very low frame rate would be a shame so I am hoping sometime in the future these features will be added so me and my friend can enjoy this without performance issues",1675524765,1677036138,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

But it doesn't! The ability to name your ducks and switch to different ones perspective is a good way to allow the players to make up their own stories about the small pool of ducks. It keeps you engaged all the time by adding more ducks to the pool, and even when you have all the ducks it still is an interesting game! The thrill me and my friends had when the first duck went down the slide was unprecedented. Also with the frequent updates and DLC the game gets, it doesn't get boring!
My literal only gripe with the game is that there is only one save file. I wish I could have more than one save file so I didn't have to restart with no ducks for the levels I already completed. But as I said that is my literal only complaint to this masterpiece of a game. If you are not playing this game you are missing out on one of the best gaming experiences of your life. 
11/10 would recommend to literally anyone. If you don't like this game, that's sad for you. You don't understand the complexity of this ambitious cinematic masterpiece, THIS GAME ISN'T STUPID YOU'RE STUPID!!!
EDIT: they did change the only thing i didnt like about the game so i am happy with this new update, but... i am SEVERELY disappointed with the removal of my FAVORITE song on the soundtrack. it was  replaced with a vastly inferior song. that song just had a vapor wave kinda vibe that i loved, i miss it a lot. but other than that i will keep playing this game till the end of time",1672073925,1677024895,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Each duck does not physically show any personality, but they all have one, and you can tell just by glancing at them. The suspense of waiting for a new duck to arrive is unimaginable, and the pure bliss of when the duck comes is incredible. The beauty of it all is how the game is somewhat simple, but also deep and rich with story. When I say this is the best financial decision I've made, I mean it.

This is very accurate and true to the nature of the plastic duck as they literally just float around. You can get them to quack or pan the camera around, switching ducks if you'd like but I had to stop playing because the ducks kept spawning in and it eventually lags my pc.

This could have been avoided if the developers allowed me an option to only spawn in ducks that don't do anything except float, as there would be no effects being rendered or interactions between ducks and at the very least it would take far longer for them to make a performance impact IN MY OPINION. Now while I haven't got that option the devs have added the next best thing with the latest patch, the ability to turn off ducks spawning in.

Word to the wise, the game is only worth it if you really like plastic ducks or are bored enough to sit there and watch them from time to time. To be fair it isn't actually that bad, just that the radio keeps on repeating itself very frequently and leads to me pressing M (mute) while ""playing"" the game.

Placid Plastic Duck Simulator is by far the most entertaining game on Steam and has an extremely intricate plot.
Here are just a few examples of the shenanigans that have occurred in the 5 hours I have played this game for:
 -My duck Gertrude gave birth to triplets, and another duck got abducted by aliens and replaced with an alien duck.
 -Timmy is determined to cross the ocean. Why? Is there someone across the ocean he wishes to find? Friends? Family? A crush? I will never know. He left and cannot return.
 -My ducks Roople VI, a firefighter, and Existential Crisis, a submarine duck, became best friends, but Roople VI was captured by the ruthless flamingo. Roople VI went mad trying to find a way out and abandoned Existential Crisis, which made Mr. Crisis swim into the ocean in search of better friends.
 -A speedy duck, Grandma's Curtains, rammed into a duck so hard that is flew into the ocean, and felt no shame about it.

If you are looking for a game with the same absurdity as the plot of Riverdale, I highly suggest this game.

games like this is usally smooth and not glitchy but sometimes the ducks glich in the tube and it fusterates me, i still love the game and mostaly its smooth.

its fusterating when like you have a sibling of friend playing and you cant check out their ducks but hopefully they'll add something like seeing other peoples ducks and just watch maybe a multi player sever too but just no naming them! that would be a curse! (maybe a thing like if one person names it they can name it something else.)

in conclusion my spelling is bad and if you like whats up above i wrote or liked most of it this is a great calming game for you if you didn't I'm sorry and find a new game!

Rylolux
 who really likes this game and if you dont like this up above try Day of Dragons a roleplaying, meeting people, having nests, growing up, and having some friends you nest and play with and their is diffrent skins for your dragon.
some people have big dreams so encourage that.

I played it off and on mostly while eating and just letting it go in the background and being really enjoyable. 

At some point I jumped in a call with my best friend while sharing my screen and she had to go do chores so I decided to quickly launch up this game again while waiting, she came back and was watching what I was doing for a bit before unmuting and asking what am I doing, and then...

We've been actively waiting for more ducks. We're going crazy. We've figured out family trees and paired ducks off together. We're making backstories and discussing about which ducks our OC's (original characters) would be their favorites... we've even started making ducks have a storybeat in our story and kinda wanna make them easter eggs xD

tl;dr - play with a friend and you'll have a wild time


The only negitive thing that I dislike about this game, and it almost made me uninstall it, is that if you re/start a new pool your previous pool will be gone - along with all your ducks, so you'll have to get them all over again. I would like if you could have the option to maybe have save files or something to get around this issue?

Look, I don't know how to describe this game to the uninitiated.  I picked it up on a sale and a whim - really wasn't expecting much out of it.  Did the install, fired it up, and about 10 mins into the game, I thought: ""Jesus another wasted couple bucks..."" but then.... it happened.  
It was something about the focus I had on one duck, another duck must have passed in the foreground, pushing the camera just into the right angle: a close up of a perfectly textured duck, the sun was setting, the palm trees were looming over the duck's back, and the pool's radio let the beat dropp.... .... ....  I couldn't describe it - i still can't describe it.  Its like all of a sudden the game...THIS GAME... it all made sense.  It felt like my heart.... my heart... do you remember play Smash Bros as Ness, and hitting a 250% Jigglypuff with the bat and it the sound it made?  That PAAAINGGG!!!!!  That happened - but to my soul.  The textures and the lighting... it just blew me away.  I tried to screen cap the moment, but I couldn't capture it through my tears.  I have been playing this game ever since...trying to recapture that moment.  The glimmer...  but it was so fleeting.  I was not ready for this game.  I feel like I am chasing a ghost....

Each one looks different and may include some special traits, like flammability or the ability to fly. They are collected as they randomly appear.

There are a couple of achievements that bring sense of progression, which I enjoyed (as long as I didn't have to wait for hours to unlock the next one). However, there's a catch: you do nothing but watch and relax, so it's up to them to unlock achievements for you.

Lighting and reflections look fantastic. The swimming pool has a dreamy retro aesthetic to it and the duckies are colourful and pretty. The music gets repetitive after a couple of hours since the radio is only a 30 minute loop, but it will be reworked soon.

Would squish again! The DLCs are absolutely worth getting too, as they greatly improve upon the base idea.",1674854569,1674857010,True,4,1,0.578377783298492432,0,True,False,False

The problems start to come with the DLC, these cost as much as the full game each and either have just 20ish ducks and nothing else, or a stage and only 4 ducks.  
Which I bought both. Played both. Unlocked all the ducks in a day and moved on with my life. 
I only load it up periodically, like if I need something in the background or notice an update coming through. 
Which it had. One that removed a holiday event I hadn't known had started. 
This event added as much content as either of the DLCs I paid for, though for free which would be nice. Only the event pack is no longer available, the missing ducks however stay as incomplete ghost ? Shadows in my collection menu. 
I wouldn't mind missing the event, if it was removed, but those that played it got to keep it. Those who had no clue it was going on and missed it do not. Yet we still get to see we missed it every time we play. 
So I reached out about this issue to the devs, who said ""please only use the issues/bug channel for bugs"" then when I asked if there was a place for feedback I was told ""I read your comment"" which was better than how some other members responded to my request. 
What might seem like a little thing to some people can be game ruiningly frustrating to another. 
If this is an indication of content updates to come I regret paying for such skimpy DLC offerings. 
I was originally happy to support such a wonderful idea. Though if my money is used on content that gets locked away because of events, and I have no way to know about these events, then I feel cheated everytime I load my collections page.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

HE FLEW AWAY!! i watched him float away in the ocean. I don't know how i will ever get over flippers loss. forever mourning :(( 

The firefighter duck also puts out fires how cute is that. 

10/10 game, cured my depression.

Update, I played for around 3 hours and then i got off to do other things, however when i logged back on i pressed play because i wanted to play and i was greeted with only one duck so i log off and im like there has to be a way to get my game back. but atlas i pressed save on that new game i created erasing all my ducks. Don't make the same stupid mistake i did, and it would be nice if they added like a save file system instead of a play and a resume button.

Update, Resume button is currently not working and i did save my progress last time i played. I am extremely upset this is the second time i've lost all my progress and this time it wasn't my fault.",1669412738,1673564491,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,4,True,False,False

it is almost a negative review due to the 'Putting Challenge' achievement issue, but the fast Developer's help changed that.
(Btw, I don't understand why they couldn't code this achievement bug for months.)
So if you're an achievement hunter, you have to prepare for suffering to obtain 100%.

Plus, you also have to purchase the 2 new DLCs to accomplish the game on 100% after they had released end of 2022 and their contain new achievement packs. 

Plus, you also have to purchase the 2 new DLCs to accomplish the game on 100% after they had released end of 2022 and their contain new achievement packs. 

1. called 'DUCKS, PLEASE‚Äô contains 4 cheevos: 
Floatpiercer, Firequackers, Beeline, and the Magnetic feel. 
[i] (TIP: You can ALSO reach them in the other DLC/winter map, but it's FASTER if you choose the base map and the 'Ducks, Please' duck collection ONLY. [/i]

2. 'QUACKING THE ICE' contains 6 cheevos: 
Off-piste ski, Quacking the ice, Fun-fun-funicular, Hot Tub, Campfire simulator, and the Scoring Challenge.
[i](Well, so I would continue this part willingly, but it's just a review, not a Guide.)[/i]

So... The expected total playtime of base game is about 10 hours, the 2 DLCs another 10-20, and finally 10-20 hours for 100% with much cry because of first mentioned achievement.

I recommend you purchase the game or the pack on sale only. According to my purse they are  ridiculous at full price. 

Besides the above I just can say one more really IMPORTANT thing about the game: 

Splash. A duck. Quack. 
Let the water rocks. 
Much duck, Even more quack.
Take your time. 
Tick-Quack. 
Relax much.
Rock. Quack.

All in all, the game is as described on the store page, so I shouldn't have been surprised by that tidbit. I somehow was though, so I'll leave my original review in case anyone's interested in reading it. [/quote]

It's more of a maybe rather than a no since I got what I, specifically, wanted [i] (achievements and +1 to my perfect games) [/i] but there's very little to the game. Given the connotation that ""Simulator"" games have, you'd think there'd be more to do, but it's quite the opposite. It's actually the purest idler I've ever played. The game certainly has potential, but I doubt the developer will take it any further. I'd suggest getting this when it's on sale like I did.

[b][u][i] What Tickles My Fancy [/i][/u][/b]
Even though I'm not exactly happy with the game, it still has some good qualities.
[list]
    [*] A well-built 3D environment that is, indeed, relaxing.
    [*] Various ducks with some having specialized abilities and sounds.
[/list]

[b][u][i] Got Any Grrripes? [/i][/u][/b]
There not being much to the game leaves me wondering what the game could be...
[list]
    [*] Huge GPU hog. At my highest resolution (2560x1440@164Hz) it's taking up 80%-85% of my GPU. At the lowest resolution (640x480@59Hz) it's taking up 70%-75% of my GPU. And for what?
    [*] Nothing to do. You literally just watch ducks spawn in and float around. With the current Christmas event, you click a present to unwrap the duck, initially, but that's it.
    [*] Only one save at a time with no warning. Managed to reset my progress because I thought I could start a playthrough on the DLC map just to try and speed things up. Ended up adding 4 or so hours to my playtime just because of that, which was slightly upsetting.
    [*] The paid DLCs are required in order to 100% the game. While it's not much money, I've never been a fan of that.
[/list]

[b][u][i] For Achievement Hunters [/i][/u][/b]
In order to 100%, you literally just open the game and do something else in the meantime. This effectively makes the game a screensaver, as many have already described. Now... some achievements are extremely random, so I'll leave these here just in case.
