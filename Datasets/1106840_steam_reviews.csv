I think its really down to the tedious parts that are novel at first when its just a few machines or parts, but when you start really wanting to build a mansion or automate, you quickly just find yourself doing a ton of ferrying runs just to collect parts to build, something like a system for ordering components and having them either delivered or picked up on a pallet would negate much of this.

The Pros:
1. The offspring of Minecraft and Satisfactory. It's exactly what you think.
2. Map is perfectly sized for the gameplay; a rarity in this day and age.
3. A complete, enjoyable experience with tons of room for the memes, before the upcoming DLC.

The Cons:
1. Doesn't have a proper multiplayer.
2. Starting grind is tedious.
3. Quests to see the king require large scale harvesting/collection systems.
4. ""I've only got these two machines for sale, but you can make more of them in Icehelm.""

My Experience:

I started off panning for iron and gold nuggets in my local creek. I then made enough money to buy my first drill and grinder. Proceeded to use this setup to build a conveyor line with twenty drills that all feed into the one grinder. Made millions of hydro coins, then proceeded to help townspeople with their fetch/make quests. Made one man a beautiful gold and sapphire necklace which he promptly threw onto the ground because the sapphire was one weight unit heavier than he wanted. Proceeded to boop him over to my plot of land and buried him alive. Then bought all the available land in the area, and nuked every square corner of it. Finally, I retired on my humble mountain of ~22,000 weight gold bars like Smaug.

My only complaint is how tedious it can be to cross the map just to go shopping, which is even worse if you don't know how much things cost, because then have to make multiple trips, and that's assuming you don't forget to bring the money in the first place. Icehelm's interior is the worst culprit of this. The scale of it is neat design-wise, but the walk in and out of it are nightmarishly long to put it nicely. The walk is at least >1-min long, and that's without even carrying a pallet, which stops you from sprinting. And then at the entrance, the elevator is the bane of my existence. Rather than staying where it last was used, it is always in motion, moving up, waiting a few seconds, moving down, waiting, over and over. The elevator is also really slow, and I might just be an unlucky sonofabitch, but I swear, that elevator, always leaves just when I get there. And then I'm left just standing there. Waiting. For. The. Goddamn. Elevator. All things considered, good game! It can seem a little tedious at first, but as soon as you get even a little bit of automation, it feels very rewarding. Manually purchasing and placing things can be a little tedious occasionally, but it feels more satisfying when you finish things because of it.

The developer recently posted a response to the massive backlash they received for making a predatory DLC that costs 2/3rds the amount of the game. It also is an isolated DLC, essentially being a secondary game. They are being scumbags in t hat, they're forcing you to buy game 1 to play game two. Then, the developers say they're dooing this predatory tactic because they undercharged for Hydroneer, thus; It's our fault and we have to pay the price for their decision making. 

I also pointed out that there's not much to the game. There's a severe lack of game balance. And the developer just keeps adding predatory F2P game mechanics to the game, ie tokens (seperate currency) that just ruins balance more. 

Now, beside this little drama let's give a real review to the game: 

The game is interesting, but has absolutely no direction or goal. The developers were going to add quests/npcs to give it a full story, but the community universally said that was a bad idea. So.... their idea was instead of introduce something else... create a DLC and charge people.

When you make stuff, it's all on a pipe, and as long you have it connected to the pipe you have 'power'. The machines and the whole system can get somewhat complicated but tends to be pretty simple to figure out.

The Energy items (basically items that can be powered by electricity instead of water , requiring a separate connection setup.)

The farming is complete crap, boring, and poorly balanced through-and-through. 

In the game you can experience everything the game has to offer in about 5 hours. They introduce a F2P secondary (and teriary) tokens system. With the tokens, you can change that to 4 hours. It was supposed to extend the play ability, but reduced it. 

They have vehicles that are poorly implemented. The digging vehicle is just absolutely unwieldy. I tried to do level lines and just couldn't do it for the life of me. The ""Discover Ores"" truck is useless, the helmet does a better job and is cheaper/easier to use. There's 4 of the same style truck with just different colors that are muted. The physics on the vehicles are pretty bad. You take any corner and you risk rolling - with the 4x4 you WILL roll, it's not even a question.

They have 'quests' int he game, which are just NPCS that wonder the world and you have to go find them. They tell you to obtian some item of certain weight/value. This is the moment that feels like there's an actual video game, but then... it's all really relaly boring. The fact you ahve to hunt these people down with no real indication .... AND they move. The rewards are totally imbalanced from them as well. 

The mining guild. I can have access to any item within 2 hours. The farming guild, it takes about 4-5 hours to access everything in farming. WHich is a seperate situation from the mining, it has nothing to do with mining and doesn't integrate well with it. So, I don't include this as part of the game, because it's so bad.

And like I said, there's nothing to do in the game. There's no over arching story. There's no friends to socialize with. There's hardly a community of actual players. Most of the time it's people showing off Not factory builds but aesthetic builds. So, even the comunity is middling at best in my eyes. 



I am going to reiterate this: The developer says he doesn't want to be seen as a shady developer. So, what does he do?
Bans all opinions on the forum that aren't just kissing his ass and calls it 'disrespectful'. I got banned for commenting on his comment of ""I don't want to b e seen as a shady developer."" I called him shady for these reasons:
Predatory Token System - without the predatory part so ... it just is a poor system ripped from F2P games and not understanding the point of secondary currency isn't to 'add fun' its to obfuscate the amount of money a person will spend on the game. 
Silencing Different Opinions
Silences Criticism of them and their game (that's not insulting or being desrespectful, showing criticsim of a specific thing the developer was concerned about.) 
They're putting out a DLC that costs 2/3rds of the games' value, blaming the customers for the fact they 'undercharge' for hydroneer... which I disagree with there's NOTHING TO THE GAME - there's 5 plots all of which do the EXACT SAME THING (some go deeper than others) there's literally no NEED to buy a seperate plot - you can experience the entire game from the tutorial area - no lie. 
The DLC t hey're charging 2/3rds for is also going to be an isolated area - aka a SECONDARY GAME - thus you have to bay them for BOTH games in order to own the SECOND game. 

This is a shady developer at this point. ANd I will be making a point to report them for being shady... and when my ban is up I will be sharing these with everyone. I will probably also post this on the reddit page, just so people are aware that the developer IS become super shady.",1707572835,1707572835,False,4,1,0.499135255813598633,0,True,False,False

idk if i should recommend this game or not. 
the biggest problem for me is 
when you place something,
you have to AIM the SHADOW SPOT! 
not the mouse indicator,
which in fact is a weird feeling for me

and oh btw, no inventory at all. and you can only pick one thing at a time.

Carrying 1 item at a time can be overcome by various means, like a pallet or your truck, but it is refreshing to not have any semblance of inventory management in the usual sense like Minecraft or Factorio.  Similar to Astroneer, all your stuff is just laying around in a glorious pile. This adds a sense of realism, and I always get a chuckle when my poor organization makes my base a giant pile of crap.

and there are a lot of pros about the game but a few major cons that I didn't much like (but, they might not bother other people)

Pros:
1) The feel of the game is fun, having to do the different jobs is what sim games are about, and this fits that role brilliantly, especially for the early game, you really start with just the bare basics and salvage a pittance to buy your first drill and things and it feels quite rewarding (though, that does quickly die off, admittedly)

2) Planning your build and how you want to set everything up is very fun, it gets the mind working and it is also really cool seeing your planning come to fruition, and planning is also key because of how long-winded it is to buy and transport the parts you want - But remembering the parts you need, taking pressure into account, planning how things will be sorted into their respective items along the way, adding logics with wires, etc. Having all these options available to consider when building an auto-mining thing is fun, and if you do it all right first time round as you envision it, and it works perfectly, I must admit is very rewarding and feels like a 3D schematic that's come to life - Its awesome

3) Having the different vehicles, different patches of land and higher tiers of drills to aim for is also a nice factor to add to the game as you can try different ideas in different areas and work on better ways to make your build more efficient, while yielding results the whole time - There are also more vehicles than I first thought too, with more being found as options to buy in other towns (some with tokens, others with coins) - It would make hardcore grinders have something to show that really shows they have spent hours on the game

4) The very start might feel like a monotonous grind, but actually, it is quite charming to have to pan for different resources and pick up the individual pieces and pop them in a crucible to melt - Making your first weapon is satisfying too. You can make hundreds of swords or daggers from very minute amounts of metal, but they sell for sell (obviously), but having the freedom to mix and match resources when crafting as well as using different amounts of resources is a good touch to the game and if you wanted an RP kind of game, I would wager that it would be more fun with friends

5) Stockpiling resources and forging weapons to sell is quite a fun mechanic, which is charmingly basic and simple to understand - Its also fun to see the highest value item you can make will be (my current record is 1.7 mil, which would have been more, but i was curious and wanted to know so i built it sooner, instead of waiting longer)

6) The furniture and housing parts are a nice touch to the game, it gives you something else to do and each town has different parts available too, so you can mix and match styles in any way you see fit, then pick one of the plots of land that you have, take all the pieces you have loaded into your truck and start building your own homestead

Cons:
1) After some time, the game does feel quite grindy, once you have a good automated system in place, you are basically golden on the money front - I only have about 4 x Tier 2 drills (which remain inactive most of the time) and I already have over 3 Million Hydrocoins, So, now there isn't much I really *want* to do - The game has other currencies in the form of tokens which are earned for different guilds by completing villager requests (the results of which can be used to buy things to make the respective guild requirements easier, like sprinklers for gardening, etc), but the game by no means requires any of them, so you can forgo the extra effort and pain as the results aren't *that* amazing.
It basically makes it so, the only ""reason"" you need better drills and would want to dig deeper is to get the two better materials, ""Cloutium"" and ""Corestone"" to make T2 and T3 respectively, but you don't *need* them... you can do everything with T1 things, the T2 drills also have a different orientation, so you cannot simply substitute your currently build with the new tier drill, it requires an entire rework of your build, which I thought was pretty sucky, tbh

2) Farming is something that is so SO slow, the plants themselves grown quite well, but the game is linked to a grid system, so that things line up nicely (which isn't the issue), however, when a pipe is connected to a water source and is not connected to anything the other end, it trickles a single drop out repeatedly, this drop can be used to irrigate 1 plant hole (Which, when digging, are NOT bound to the same grid system), So, having to have LOADS of pipes to get a large yield of crops is a nightmare, and while the sprinkler solves this issue (i would imagine), each one is very expensive in tokens and would require hours upon hours of growing a plant, waiting for it to grow, destroying the crop, replanting one, waiting, and so on, just to get enough crops to make 1 soup to get 88 tokens, when a sprinkler costs over 2000... And seeing as the only *real* reward from a large plant harvest (after you dont need tokens for maximising efficiency) is just getting more Hydrocoins, you might as well completely forgo that side of the game and favour the mining

3) While novel at first, having to load up a car with each and every single piece of equipment takes a very long time, and there are pallets which somewhat make this easier (and trucks can hold endless stuff as the pieces merge through one another when in that area), it still takes forever to load up the truck with things, especially with pipes (which you always need loads of) or building pieces - I like the feel of going into a shop, picking up the item and placing in the ""buy zone"" and paying for it, that's a nice touch, but having to pick up, drop, buy, pick up, move to truck, place in truck, and so on, PER ITEM takes an ungodly amount of time

4) I have over 50 drills mining chunks of dirt for processing, and production is great, however, the amount of items that are on the belts (as each lump counts as an item) makes the frames take a serious hit, I have a nice Laptop that can run many games with ease, but the frame rate drops massively to the point where I had to isolate a whole 27 drill segment of my build just to make sure the game ran smoother, which for an autonomy game is annoying

5) Lastly, (and this is just a personal gripe), For some reason, it ALWAYS seems to be night time - You can sleep and make it day time, but night comes around every 15mins, which, in a grind game, (and a game that takes FOREVER to shop en masse for things), isn't much good, because 15mins goes REALLY quickly, without even noticing - But, when night falls, the darkness just makes it next to impossible to see on the land patches, and requires you to sleep (or use an annoying mining helmet for a small circle of light) - Like i said, its a personal gripe, but I've had to resort to shopping in the dark so that by the time i get back it should be light (which it rarely is and still requires a sleep) - I just find it annoying, and as ""Sleep"" and other survival factors aren't actual mechanics, it wouldn't be out of place to maybe put the option to take the day/night cycle off

Overall, though, I would definitely say that the pros outweigh the cons - Just view the game as a casual play and don't look towards the ""End Goal"" and the games is so much more fun - The more you try and aim for something, the further and further away it seems, despite steady progress.
So, i will probably still play the game after this review, and I would certainly recommend it too.
If you use the £1 per hour of play system, i have got about 4x my money's worth from this game (purchased at £12.79)
But, If you aren't happy spending that, when it goes on offer, *then* buy it, because it is a well made game and is very fun",1707095849,1707095849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Graphics of the game is alright no matter what your settings are, how ever i do recommend a DECENT gaming computer if you want to up the ante on your graphics. Its honestly just a game, there's no story line, just make money as FAST as you can in order to upgrade to bigger and better. The grind level is quite a bit to begin with, but once you unlock your first machines that you can buy, it PROGRESSIVELY gets quicker!! The first plot of land is rather small, but there's 5 you can own in the game, so running out of things to do isn't going to be quick. It is easy to learn, but I will recommend to watch a few videos on YouTube to TRULY master the art of Hydroneer! I haven't come across any bugs as of yet, except the true lag even on potato graphics when there's MINERALS..... EVERYWHERE!!!!
I would say the to wait for a sale on steam to buy this game, or if you really want it.. then yea if you have some spare money laying around. 

Few hints..
You can dig sand, and then divide the sand by two by scoop the sand, place it down, then you BASICALLY got unlimited sand/dirt. Just scoop, place on ground, take half, place in bucket, take other half, place BACK ON GROUND and its a full pile again.
Second Hint..
Minerals may be bigger and heavier the lower you go and dig, what the game doesn't tell you!!!!! Is that if you BRING the sand back to the top, ITS THE SAME WEIGHT AND RATIO as the level you started on. Don't bring your sand or dirt to the top to wash, do it as far down as you can to get MAXIMUM mineral weight ratio.",1706531107,1706707483,True,4,1,0.484974563121795654,0,True,False,False

A year (or was it two?) ago, the dev promised multiplayer, which, yes, there technically is multiplayer, but it requires that your friend is either physically beside you or using some sort of remote connection.

The dev is now, instead of delivering what he promised in the first place, making a DLC, which, to be completely fair, adds a lot of content. I can understand wanting some more money from the game, but a DLC that puts large amounts of content behind a paywall is not a good method.

If he instead, y'know, kept his promises, and made some proper progression past the 15th hour, then maybe more people would buy the game, thus resulting in more funds.

I feel, with the current state of things, that the dev cannot be trusted, and even though I, at time of writing, have approx. 120 hours in-game, that I wasted my money.

TL;DR
Dev can't keep his promises, and is focusing on the wrong things


EDIT: 
I have read the new post, but it still does not change my opinion of neither the game or the dev, if you need to make an extra post explaining why you did what you did, then you're clearly doing something wrong.

- You can only carry one object at a time.  Need to run a 100 object length of pipe?  You have to manually grab each piece and place it one at a time.  The only way around some of this is to use something big enough to load items.  Metal bars into pans, pipes into a truck, then carry/drive that container object around.  And items like a conveyor belt wont fit in a pan
- Even your money is physical item, and not a stat, and requires carrying it around into buckets to push buttons to buy stuff with it.
- Expanding is a pain, especially if you want to reuse stuff.  You have to manually take it apart, one by one, then rebuild one by one.
- Starting out is very slow.  Use shovel to dig dirt, put dirt in a pan, get water into pan (with bucket or dump pan in water), use brush on pan, pick ore out of pan, put it somewhere to sell, repeat until you can afford to automate
- Your starting plot can earn enough Hydrocoins in a few hours with 4 digging units to buy nearly everything you could want with Hydrocoins
- Automation units degrade over time, and need repaired with the flimsiest wrenches in the world (single use each!)  Eventually you need water filters to protect any and all drills and grinders, BUT, now the water filters will each break over time, and more often than the working machines!
- You can fish or farm as well now (since I last played), but they're both going to have a lot of manual one by one interactions
- You can't even buy a watering can for farming until you've proven yourself you can grow a plant and feed someone tomato soup.

I feel if you want to play this game like a sane person, and try to do it like a factory game, you're playing it for the wrong reason, as every other well known factory game does a way better of job of this.

This is a game so overtly designed to be as fussy and needlessly slow as possible to stretch out its playtime and it is far too slow to get even remotely going. 

This in itself would not be so bad were it not for the fact that the interface and physics add yet more to the already-frustrating slowness of the gameplay loop - one which becomes tedious rapidly.

That loop seems simple enough: dig four loads of earth... except for no discernible reason these need to first go via a bucket before being put in a pan. This pan then needs submerging in water. Cue furiously scrabbling round after it as it invariably ricochets off the riverbed. Pan wrangled, it's time to brush the dirt out for some meagre nuggets, assuming you can get it to drop on its backside as any real-world pan full of dirt and water would? This one? Upside down, obviously.

The fun doesn't end there. Despite there being both target and drop reticles, these feel oddly imprecise. I was stunned to learn the game [I]wasn't[/I] designed for VR, because it sure as hell feels like it (in all the wrong ways). 

Wait till I tell you that there's no inventory and you can only ever hold one item at a time - of [I]anything[/I]. Lucky enough to not fall asleep with boredom after digging up, panning and filtering twenty nuggets? Enjoy loading them one at a time into your smelter. Sorry, into the crucible that you then have to put into your smelter, because this game likes extra steps. You could try putting them all in a pan and upending it, but half off them will just ding off the sides and bounce off the ground in all directions.

Even as you start to unlock the next gameplay elements of crafting, this is again ridiculously fussy, with conditions needing to be just so and actually against the clock. Even better, when trying to fish ingots out of your furnace, the button for picking them up and [I]picking up the whole damn furnace[/I] is the same.

Have a guess what I spent about 75% of my time doing while trying to aim at a glowing hot ingot in the middle of a similarly-coloured blizzard of particle effects.

This game teases so much promise so early but is absolutely ruined by its poor interface, infuriating physics and deliberately slowed pace. You want to be able to come in of an evening, spend an hour or so getting a gameplay loop going and then get on with your life. This game takes 3 hours to get even remotely started.

But boring and painful after a while. Everything feels like it was designed to stretch out the playtime.

Building is bad and annoying. (No inventory or GUI)
I know it's intended that way, but it makes the game worse to play.

The atmosphere of the world feels kinda soulless and unfinished. That's why I think a dlc is not a great idea.

I also think the game lacks an endgoal. For some it would be breaking the game with piles of gold or earning millions but it just ain't fun the way the game is designed. After buying my second plot, I didn't get the purpose to buy another.

I haven't tried farming but I think it won't be a better experience

1. No rewarding end game goals.
2. No way to seamlessly migrate from your factory on the starting field to the extended one.
Because of these 2 factors together, you don't have a strong motivation to leave your starting land plot to build something big on another plot.

To elaborate (1). What might be a reason for you to build a big factory? More resources, more money - but what you will buy with these resources? To clear quests? It doesn't feel rewarding. To create expensive items? For what? Could building a huge factory be a goal by itself? Might be, but not for anyone.

About (2). You have to deliver every part from the shop to your land plot. Even with wooden pallets, it's a lot of manual labor and feels too grindy. There is a problem with game flow, when you deliver many parts to your plot to understand that you forgot something and you have to return to the shop. Also, imagine placing 100 pipes on a pallet one by one, and it is only one part type.

1 could be fixed by introducing well designed end game goals. For example, some meta-game might be introduced, so you can produce items on a larger scale to make a difference for a whole kingdom.
2nd could be fixed by introducing part orders, when you just write a number how many parts of this type do you need, and they are delivered to the desired plot, for some extra money maybe.

As said earlier, the game still enjoyable to some extent, but because of these 2 factors, I feel that it misses some of its potential.",1706133092,1706133092,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Max, you're not ""scummy"" like you think you are. We know this. It's just that the community feels you're using your resources on the wrong areas. The DLC really comes off as you've spent all the funds on building new features. Most people just want to play this game from their own computers without using Remote Play Together/Parsec.
I cannot stress this enough, most of the people I show this game to, eventually become irritated by the whole split-screen aspect and that's the only thing stopping them from playing with me more often.
And I understand that you need to rebuild the game from the ground up, but that's exactly what I'm suggesting.

I got the game and played it non stop for 2 days. But then I got the point where I was printing money infinitely, albeit slowly, the setup required no maintenance except for the occasional refill of spanners and the next thing would be to make a new setup, next tier of machines for even more profit.

But why? I know these kinds of games are sandbox, set your own goals kind of thing. But as far as I could tell, there was no end-goal. Nothing to truly invest towards to show off your builds.

Factorio has rockets and expanding your factory across an infinite world to increase your rockets/min is the goal, Satisfactory has the space elevator and the Awesome Sink continously counting up your points.

And all of these are resource costing objectives that you always aim for and to be more efficient, get more points, send more rockets you need to expand. But there is no such thing here.

The game is lovely, I like the premise of it. But there is strictly no point to it yet, other than player-defined goals.
You have the quests you get which primarily just give you 2 types of tokens to buy the next tier of machines. But when all that is set up, you just stop playing, or spend the rest of your day perfecting the setups you have. One item at a time, cuz that's the carry limit.

Update: A DLC was announced for the game, which confuses me since I, amongst many others based on the commentsection of the announcement, mistakenly thought the game was in Early Access based on its current state.

I bought the game the day after it released for around 7 euro's. It was a fun game but buggy. I remember losing nuggets and tools through the world floor, items being so bouncy with collision issues that they got catapulted out of the world, never to be found again and more.
The common bugs I found are gone now. The free updates and a dedicated dev team made sure of that. Could there still be bugs? Sure, every game has them. Even AAA games, which have usually more bugs and glitches than indie games.

This game is a really fun game that you can pick up when you feel like it. Casual mining, exploring a world, getting money to improve your setup and build your house or whatever you want. It is a sandbox mining game. 
If you dislike grinding, it is probably not the game for you. So think before you buy. Watch some gameplay video's and read up on the game. I dislike grinding in a lot of games but this one is just fun.

I don't really get why people are getting mad because of a dlc. I own around 1200 games and 2000 dlc's. I've seen okay games getting turd dlc's that are really meant for cash grab. Less polished games with a dev team and publisher behind it that don't care about the players, or the game itself. Hydroneer seems, to me, like they care about the game and players. I sure hope that every person understands that making games costs money and to be able to improve on the game they need income or development can't continue. 

If you don't like the dlc, just don't buy it. Keep in mind, if you read this review and many others, that bad reviews that mention the dlc and EA game, are probably over exaggerated. I'd say, be open minded and look up sources of gameplay and decide yourself. 

I know I will buy the dlc after it comes out. Just so I can enjoy new content for this game and to support the dev's.",1705141023,1705141023,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2023: Still banned for writing a negative review, game still not good

playtime is a lot of afking to avoid the immense grind. Dev didnt want people to get the grind done though, so they made the new tier softlocked behind extremely grindy quests.

a t3 pipe costs ~250 tokens, I get maybe 500 tokens from a quest and its a lot of effort.
now, for any reasonable setup you first need ~50-100 pipes to just reach the location of your drills, then another 50 to wire up a reasonable amount of drills (10-20). only thing you can do is use other pipes on conveyors to conserve tokens.
Aka you need to do 2 dozen quests just to power your drills, not even use any of the ""prospecting"" stuff!

TL;DR: grind, grind and more grind to artifically inflate playtime.


P.S.: now dont say I am whining about ""a little grind"", Ive grinded TWO chars in Borderlands 2 to OP 8 LEGIT, that took HUNDREDS of hours EACH. But know what changed? I am not a teen anymore, I have to WORK and PAY FOR LIVING, the little time I get to play games should not be wasted on GRINDING.

The game is very broken and buggy, it takes 50 hours to set up a mining operation since you can only move one piece at a time but don't bother fixing that right? Just milk everyone for more money. I liked the game and its fun for a while, but it's an awful time sink that doesn't need to be if we just had an inventory. Add content to the base game and sell more copies, stop expecting the playerbase to fund more content that we have to pay for and just make a good game that more people will want to buy. There is no mid-late game at all, it's just (dig down and use tier 1, buy tier 2 and dig lower, buy tier 3 and dig lower) and congrats! That's all she wrote! Farming and fishing are terrible and make no sense, plus the cooking is dumb since everyone only pays in a few coins a piece and need 10,000 for an achievement. All in all the game is just boring and grindy, and all they thought about was milking us for more money and its gross. 
All the hours I have in the game are because you can only move one thing at a time, you try to dive the terrible driving cars to get to the one spot that sells pipes and buy ONE pipe at a time, over and over and over and over again then take those pipes ONE at at time and put it in the back of the car, limp over to where your digging and ONE by ONE you pull them out and set them up. Miss a pipe or two? All the way back to buy what you need and come back. It's awful, so my 100 hours is about 98 hours of buying and moving parts.
If you have alot of ore or bars enjoy your FPS dropping to nothing, a game about mining and what you mine for destroys your FPS if you have too much in one spot or have to move it, but don't fix those things just make paid DLC!
Want to see abuse of the ban system?

Hey folks, I've addressed the points made in this thread as well as others in this new post, please take a look: 
Ya all your doing is justifying milking your playerbase, the game as no endgame at all, farming and fishing are useless but make sure you forget all of that and want more money.

We need better progression early game. We need better ways to transport items, like an inventory system. We need better ways to repair machines.

Instead we're getting an expansion with more features. Which is fine in some ways, but I worry for the game's future if it plans to keep building onto a foundation that needs work.

Intro mining is overly complex, there's no character inventory for anything, not even the 'coins' which are easy to lose in the ground cover if you drop them and they don't fall where you were pointing.. When dropping anything (which aside from coins is always quantity 1) you have to determine/guess where the shadow pointer on the target surface is and many such surfaces do not allow  said pointer to be visible. The only thing I've seen stack thus far is coins. value calculations for quests and sale prices are based on 'weight' but you are unable to determine the weight of an item.. It's just a mess. Creating a base, is even worse.. the grid pattern is weird and will often place things well above ground/surface level. and until you can buy a special tool, you can easily accidentally pickup a piece of your base and be unable to place it back where you picked it up from. For a production/factory/automation game, it is just lousy  3/10. Because the toony graphics are arguably amusing.

I would say any time I feel the desire to play, I do so for maybe 1-2 hours for about a week before I get bored. This game's 'progression' is a bit shallow where it really only offer's the same options for production, but 'faster'. At some point they did add some interesting new items and features, but those are more for 'fun' than they are for expanding the options you have.

My biggest gripe is that this game would be SOOOOOO much better with good multiplayer (I'll explain more in a bit), as this would take away from the weird, awkward loneliness that creeps up as you repetitively do the same thing, as well as make it more interesting with the couple plots of purchasable land. This is probably the biggest miss that keeps me from booting the game back up.

For anyone looking at this game seeing the [Shared/Split Screen Co-op] tag, this game does not have traditional multiplayer. It has local split screen co-op only. You may ask then how you are meant to play with your friends online. Well, the developers rely on Steams 'Share Play' feature. For those who don't know how this works, essentially one of you is actually playing the game on your computer, and another is invited to play the game through a sort of 'shared screen' format. You will see both of your screens, like back when we played the campaign in Halo. You will have to annoyingly configure control setup, meaning if you both with to play Keyboard and Mouse, one of you will need to change all of your keybinds, or you will both be controlling the same character (This means the 'best' way is for one controller player, and one KBM player). And then there is the latency issue. If both players have good internet, aren't too far from one another, and the host has consistent upload speeds, then this is not an issue. However, in almost every case I've experienced where I have tried this with a friend, the connection and lag is too much to enjoy the game.

TLDR:
The game is 'fun'. Technically speaking the gameplay has enough content to warrant it's price point. Personally, I cannot recommend a logistics, sandbox game that does not have complex logistics and/or good multiplayer.",1704910939,1704910939,False,24,0,0.661080539226531982,0,True,False,False

Start of the game has you manually panning for resources for about an hour or two. Alright, a slow start, whatever. Then you get your first automation and you start to set things up and you are earning some decent coin, but you start running into the faffing problems.

You can only carry one item at a time. The game is all about placing pipes, conveyor belts, foundations, etc. A basic sorting build is about 20 items. You have to manually pick them up at a store, load them onto your car one by one, then unload them and place them at the correct space. In something with similar amount of leaning on realism and pipework, that would've been 5 minutes of work. In this, it's a half an hour job. And that's the simplest most basic setup for automation.

Want to move to a new plot and build something bigger? Hope you have hours saved up because you will be manually placing one foundation at a time. Want to dig some nice looking mine with straight walls and floors? Nope, you mine in round-ish clumps, you are basically sculpting with an ice cream scoop. Good thing foundations and wall can cover everything up oh wait that's an hour to just cover up your mess...

Want to do some cool crafting with all the ores you've picked up? Great, you can make a dagger out of the iron, and if you're feeling fancy you'll spit that one bar into two and make an axe. If you are pro, you will split it into three parts and make a sword! It's not much harder, you're not using extra resources, and the result yields you more money so why isn't that some kind of default...

Oh, and hope you don't miss-click and dump a bucket of ore on the floor instead of going into a furnace. If you don't have a magnet wand to pick things up you will spend some good time fixing your mistake one nugget at a time...

- Inventory system - This game needs it badly
- Everything you need is too spread out, and it takes too long to get from place to place
- The vehicles are all kinda jank, which makes the previous point even worse
- The entire game in general is a bit jank honestly. Sometimes you'll need to dig through piles of items to get what you need which is buried underneath
- You should be able to locate villagers on the map

Game is fun but not when u lose all progress

EDIT: Now that online multiplayer isn't being fully made to a normal MP i wouldn't recommend buying the game solo gets somewhat boring fast to bad.

EDIT: Ive now spent a decent time in 2.0 now and am at the same impass i was before the game is decent but i see no reason to keep playing, after 5hrs i had a decent auto-farming going on and the other land plots were going to take way to long to get flat or even decent with a rake.

typically on games that take 60 or more hours from my life typically have really rich plot and characters that always keep me wanting more, or perhaps some addictive gameplay such as a vast set of crafting that requires tedius ingrediants but the results are worth it.

mechanics:
- very interesting strategy to move materials to a sorting area for collection.
- very fun way of gathering gold and buying equipment that you actually have to haul to its destination
- each loction you unlock gives you access to more higher quality and oddly specifc gear

graphics and plot:
- random NPC at garbage place saying ""one mans trash is another mans hot trash"" (the recycler i think)
- 4 or 5 settlements each with an art style , several biomes like ice and forest and ocean front..
- lots of mumbling from NPC (voice acting) honestly i wish more games did this, stardew valley can benefit a lot from even the simplist of grunts (voice acting) which im pretty sure it was from the designers or developers

-You have a cursor, but it doesn't correlate to where you're placing objects; for *that,* you have to refer to your *second* cursor, which is actually a shadow effect and is therefore really hard to see on certain surfaces.
-Your machines break down. A lot. This doesn't add anything fun, it just means you have to buy a single-use(!) wrench and click at them sometimes. It's a time tax, in a genre whose whole appeal is making assembly lines and letting them run without intervention from you.
-In the early game you'll be panning for ores manually. The pan can hold several shovel loads of dirt--but only if you put that dirt in the bucket first and empty the bucket into the pan. If you try to fill the pan with your shovel directly? Then it only holds a single scoop of dirt. *Why.*
-You can only carry one item at a time. So for example, if you want to do some fishing, you can't carry your fishing rod and bucket at the same time; hope you enjoy loading everything you own onto a slow-moving wheelbarrow or vehicle, because that's what you'll be doing in situations like this.
-Likewise, your various currencies exist as objects in the world instead of just being tied to your character. So if you want to run to town and buy a single item, well, hope you brought your vehicle with you, otherwise you'll be leaving your cash at whatever store you were shopping at. And if you end up with multiple piles of coins and want to combine them, you can't do that while the coins are in a cart or pan or whatever; you have to drop the piles on the ground--good luck aiming with that wonky shadow-cursor by the way--and then pick them back up.

On that note, the thing that finally made me give up on this game for now: when items are added to a container, like a vehicle or pan or whatever, they cease being physics objects. There are good reasons for this, it makes hauling large loads of items easier, and I imagine it helps performance a ton. However, it also creates situations like the coin-stacking bit mentioned above--and more frustratingly, it makes using crucibles an absolute pain in the backside. If you accidentally add ores to a crucible when it's not *quite* hot enough, does it auto-melt the nuggets when it gets to the right temperature? Of course not, the nuggets aren't in the physics anymore, so they just sit there in the crucible like they would in a pan. But unlike in a pan, you can't tip the crucible over and empty them out; the only thing you can pour out of a crucible is liquified metal. So if you accidentally drop a whole pan full of nuggets in a crucible that's not at the melting point yet, you now have to pick each of them out one by one and drop them back in the crucible. And because of the ""your cursor matters for picking things up but not for putting them down"" design decision, you have to point at a single nugget, pick it up, then turn like forty-five degrees to the left to drop it into the crucible. Over and over again, potentially dozens of times.

And yeah, sure, you could use a magnet on a stick to pick up all the nuggets at once instead, but that's slow and tedious, not particularly accurate since, again, the actual pile of stuff isn't where your cursor is, and more to the point: instead of using a wonky in-game item to circumvent a frustrating design choice, the frustrating design choice just shouldn't be in the game to begin with.

This is not the fun kind of jank, this is just refusing to take cues from the last thirty years' worth of video games. This game is updated pretty regularly, so maybe some of these frustrating choices will be ironed out eventually and I will probably reinstall in a year to see what's changed, but I really doubt they're going do anything as major as adding an inventory system or changing how cursors work at this stage in development.",1703809561,1703809720,False,59,6,0.554224312305450439,3,True,False,False

I had to drop the bucket in the water for anything of the sort and pick up from there, then I missed filling mud in the pan about 5 times because the crossair aims center but the actions seems to take place in the bottom of the screen.

I come back every now and then and there is a new update which is good and it's nice to see that the developers are working hard on this game and truly care about it but the updates have yet to give a true point and long term goal to the game which severely impacts the immersion and doesn't give you much of a reason to continue playing for more than a month or two. The poly-based art style is good and really matches the game well but is missing aspects which makes the game feel like your playing a simulation instead of a game.

Overall, there are many options and things to do in the game but it lacks detail and a goal so there is much to improve on.

I can't recommend it though, because the pain points are just too many and way too severe.

* Tutorial is helpful, but not enough. There is not any description anywhere on how things work, so you will be spending a lot of time searching internet for answers, and stumble across spoilers.

* While trying to figure out the game, my computer crashes three times. It have never crashed once since I bought it. It's a gaming desktop computer, the type that launches all new triple AAA on high quality, never have to check system requirements. Casing is hot enough to fry eggs. Reduce video settings twice to see if it helps, it still crashes. Removed side panel, running with open casing, and that's the only way the game will run for me. What are you doing with the GPU??? It's an RTX 3080, should be more than enough...

* Gameplay is far from polished and non-fun elements are shoved in your face. You spend more time on these non-fun elements than on any game progression. For example, there is no inventory. You can only carry one item at a time, forcing you to drag a wagon around everywhere. Pulling the wagon reduces your speed, so you will often opt to still run with one item to semi-close locations instead of taking the wagon/vehicle... just to realize to grabbed the wrong thing by mistake, or any other arbitrary reason forces you to run back and forth again to change items. ""Should have just walked slowly with the whole wagon instead"". The ""immersion"" with this design choice is far, far, far, from making up for the non-fun pain that it adds.

* You actually do get a vehicle that you can drive with to locations further away. All fun and convenient until you run out of water the first time (it uses water as fuel), and you realize that the only way for you to refuel it is to WALK all the way back to your base, pick up a bucket, then WALK all the way back to the vehicle again, misclick when pouring the water so you have to WALK to the closest river you can find and fill up the bucket again.

* You could actually just buy a bucket in the closest (still not close) village instead of running all the way back to the base, buckets are cheap. Oh, forgot that there's no inventory and your coins are also back at your base...

* Other than that, driving the vehicle is smooth, other than OH, THE ONLY AVAILABLE MAP IS A SEPARATE IN-GAME ITEM. At least I thought of bringing the map with me. Lucky me, the navigation is now as simple as PARKING YOUR VEHICLE, GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND GO TO THE TRUNK, LOOK AT THE MAP, TRY TO REMEMBER THE TURNS, PUT THE MAP BACK IN THE TRUNK, ENTER THE VEHICLE, DRIVE AGAIN. Next crossroad you see a tower, ""wonder what that is"", LET'S CHECK THE MAP... OH GOD WHY

* All quests I found wanted items of particular weight. Only problem is that there is no scale anywhere, or so it seems. Visiting all villages and all stores, nothing (also get to experience vehicle running out of water far from home, yay), gave up and searched on internet if there is any scale anywhere. Turns out that there is only one store in one particular village (not really walking distance from starting base) that has a scale to sell. All this pain just to figure out how to complete a quest.

* Finally, got the items of correct weight to complete quests. Only problem is that quest givers don't accept the items I bring. Tried four quests with different items in different locations, none worked. Then realized that the scale that I bought had snapped below ground, with the weight display not visible. I was watching the price display, interpreting that as weight. Nice to spend hours trying to figure that out.

* Finally got my drill in place, starting to produce enough materials to craft some more advanced items on the anvil. PAIN. Sometimes works, sometimes not, never know why. Seems I need to put the bars exactly right? Seems like I need to be faster so that the bars are still hot? Seems like some combinations of materials doesn't work? Seems like there is some minimum size of bars? I don't know, there is no feedback, no message, nothing. It just doesn't work and never tell my why. Repeat enough times and it does work. Clueless.

* FINE, I'll just craft simple items that do work on the first try so that I can farm some money for a harvester and extra drill, let me get some production going. Moving back and forth, getting into the flow. Umm... feeling dizzy.... want to puke... am I motion sick? Looking it up online again, apparently there are many reports on motion sickness with this game. Last straw.



I'm five hours into the game, experience is nothing but pain, even though I think the game is fun in the moments that I actually get to play it. It's just that there is pain everywhere and if I am to struggle through the pain to get to the good parts, then I want to do it without motion sickness on top of it all. Plus I am a bit afraid that it will fry my GPU.",1702803399,1702803399,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yeah, the initial premise seems fun, but then... Like, the game lacks content and does so massively: youonly  have 4 metals & 4 gems to mine which are basically all available at the start of the game (it's the ratio that will be improving as you play) to craft 5 types of items (while there's 3 of them which there's no point in crafting, like at all).

Is there really a point going though the quirky & awkward controls and UIX in order to automate the items you can play with from the very start of the game? Personally, for me: no, not at all. I really couldn't find any reason for myself to stay in the game, there's simply no goal or proper progression here like in other crafting & automation games. The ""farming"" part they've added simply adds the width with the same shallow outcome.

Overall, this game could have been good. But it ain't. It ain't at all.
Firstly, it's poorly optimized : when Satisfactory is looking absolutely fantastic and can handle thousand of stuff roaming through your coveyor, Hydroneer just can't and will sometimes stack, without reasons your ressources, making your game crash.

The quest tokens (guild and farm) are absolutely horrible to farm and what they get you is for the biggest part... useless.
Only one vehicle really is optimal, it being the hydrotruck (MK.I and II), the others : useless. Shoutout to quest vehicles (to dig the ground) being the worst of them all.

Farming crop is useless, not fun, long.

Farming ressources is pretty much the same but your machines keeps breaking every 15 minutes, making the ""automatisation"" part your worst nightmare. Best of all ? If you install a mod to get rid of this horrible breaking feature, you won't get any success.

And once you start getting a lot of ressources, there's nothing more to do. It bad. Just, don't.

so in addition to my previous review STILL STANDING I have been banned from this dev's forums for simply replying to a Dev's answer to a question unfavourably to the dev's about ME wasting MY time when I could have been working more productively toward mining the new T3 resource.

I've waited nearly a YEAR & even Valve itself reviewed my now deleted post history I was an overwhelmingly posative helpful comunity member helping people by answering question & the like. Yet this dev tossed all that away over a misunderstanding...

The thing this game lacks, is the WOW factor that keeps you coming back. to clarify, there are things to do, but little reason to do them, once you have an initial set-up the game becomes a money printing machine where your only progression is in the time taken to achieve those things.

The progression in the beginning is quite slow and the manual process gets very tedious very quickly. on the other hand however, once you get fully automated the game again becomes fairly tedious so there is only that bit in the middle where you are ""improving"" your factory that really feels engaging and fun.

The world is big but not too big so you get a range of locations to explore and exploit but you seem to spend an unnecessary amount of time ferrying things to and from your factory which makes the game feel even more tedious.

Not a game breaker for many here but the multiplayer being locked to local only seems weird, any game involving construction is asking to be shared with others, we all want to show our build to someone, so open it up to true online multiplayer functionality to get that experience.

What the game needs, IMO, is purpose. It needs a reason to buy an additional plot of land, such as locally specific resources, a reason to improve the factory, more than just desire, like time constraints on some of the construction requests. a tangible and Incorporated progression system, currently there are three guilds with independent currency which seems disjointed, maybe use a simple reputation system to lock items for progression but segregated commerce doesn't feel like the way it should work. finally, a reason to want to play, after only nearly 50 hours of in game time, i started to run out of things to do, this shouldn't be something gimmicky like another faction with independent coins but something progressive.
this game seems to be an interesting blend of factory and farming sim but in my honest opinion, it needs to decide on what it's long term aim is going to be. 

it is for the reasons above that i cannot with honesty leave a thumbs up, I would not in my experience value this game at the amount it is currently priced at (£12.79 GBP) although it is a fun game, there simply isn't enough to keep me coming back right now, but i hope that this will change with future updates.",1702464502,1702464502,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

This game had potential, Today Jan 5 2022 with the announcement multiplayer will be steam remote play with split screen the game is dead in the water for the following reasons.

1)split screen cutting your view in half while making you watch the 1 other player you can have join you 
2)Steam remote play is janky at best and makes for a poor gaming experience
The next is the most important
3) The dev states they refuse to go to a publisher because they will want to adjust some of the quality of life parts of the game while helping with multiplayer, things that would be appreciated like an inventory system.


Edit 2.0:

after the update game is still janky, physics issues cut in half, but 2 hours of play will bring even the best pc's down to a stutter. 
1. still has memory leaks, 
2.still stupidly janky (lost 2 trucks in under an hour)(Yes i mean lost, as in they flew into space and despawned)
3. made the game more difficult as you can not by machines anymore (must craft drills after the first drill is purchased)
4.Steam remote split screen play (Enough said)
5. Force players to go to the new big forge for any machines, making players haul things half way across the world
6. no proper explanation of ANY of the new features and changes (trust me when you make machines this is important)
7. the new plots are kinda nice but would have preferred systems be corrected over new plots of land.

8. The dev still refuses to use the multiplayer back-end that comes with unreal engine, opting for the inferior  Steam remote play as they could not be bothered giving us decent multiplayer 
or an inventory system due to Dev Ego issues.

While i am 100% behind small dev teams, i play many independent games that all offer multiplayer (some with teams as small as 2 people) while this dev is too set in stone about how it has to be exactly how he wants it.

2.1 Edit

Still broken
added more mechanics so the game can break more
Vehicles are janky like they were back in 1.0
now we have random npc chatter to help make more lag (on a ryzen 5 3600 w/64gb ram and Rx6750)
still no movement on multiplayer, or any real bug squashing.

only saving grace? i can run down the Npc's to take out my frustrations 

Prospecting update:

Who knows, commented on Video for the launch informing another poster about what has happened in a prior video (downsize team/remote play over multiplayer) got banned saying 

""Devs are people too, maybe try to be nice"" 

In their next post claimed they had not downsized but hired more staff, and posts a link to the video where Max states ""Now instead of a team of programmers it will be just me. and speaking to that we have DOWNSIZED our programming team""... but tell people this and you get banned.

This just goes to show you their integrity seeing they still refuse to acknowledge everyone asking for proper multiplayer and choose to ban them for complaining about what they have been given when promised multiplayer when they purchased it.

contacted the dev's by mail did all what they asked, there solution is do not play the game because the game can not handle it. waste off money if you ask me.:steamthumbsdown:

Deleted Cortex deleted the mods deleted the game and reinstalled. Nothing works lagg lagg and now the game is starting to crash for no reason what so ever. I hope they come with a biggggg fix soon before that i will not play this anymore. And i will keep an eye out for anything else they will be making not going to spend money on that either.
This should be a working game and it is not!!!

Dark Wolf 27 aug om 12:23 
Razer said ha ha, no cortex is not the problem and if you already deleted it and tried again i guess that should be answer enough.

Dark Wolf 23 aug om 17:04 
Thx for the respons, really a nice game to play but sadly only to a point the lagg is huge with a big builds.

Did what you asked me to do deleted razer cortex rebooted and started hydroneer, amazing lagg still no results from deleting Cortex.
Going to contact them also and ask if cortex could be the problem.

1. When you leave your dig site and come back, there's a 90% chance your machine got clogged up somehow. It appears to happen consistently when using sorters, but other machines suffer from it as well. It's not something you can build around, as it's simply ""a sorter has a 5% chance to not process the material and leave it in the way"". When this happens to 5 minerals, suddenly nothing is processed. 
2. They slow you down via quests, which give you unique currency instead of money. While this can be a good approach to extend the life of the game, picking up and turning in the quests is miserably slow. When you see a quest that's not worth your time, too bad. It's permanent until you complete it.
3. The biggest limiting factor is how your character can only pick up 1 thing at a time and do 1 thing at a time. Imagine Factorio, where you had to craft all your conveyor belts at 1 location, and then run them over one by one to place them. A pallet helps minimally. This can be fun to start but please make some sort of ""butler"" robot that you can request things to be built and it'll build them. It can cost 1 million dollars. Or 10 million. But something to strive for to ease the manual suffering.",1701321052,1701321052,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

a lot of fun

cheap

Unfortunately, due to the controversy surrounding the banning of JoseFaction from the Hydroneer community, I have to say that this game is losing its spark. The modding community is pretty much dying, and players are liable to be punished by having achievements disabled just for using mods that add depth, fix bugs or add QOL features.

As far as cozy games go, this one just isn't fun anymore. I may reinstall it at some point, if I see some major updates that add depth, or if JoseFaction is allowed to return.

The devs also dont really listen to feedback and just copy paste a premade answer under comments with criticism. 
This Comment From another user represents my view on it perfectly:
Very little info about the items, you'd need to use their wiki, but the wiki asks for help to write articles on every single item, so no help there either.
Basically, devs are too lazy to write documentation. I wonder how messy their project is...

Then regarding the content: there is not much to discover, also there is not really any reason for you to progress after you automated the first drill, I mean... you will always do the same, you get more money, but what would I need the money for anyways? To buy more machines that give me more money and then what, use that money again to buy more machines? It's a boring game loop. There is no endgame content worth the time spent on this game.

I'm not even going to argue regarding the game mechanics, I don't like them much because everything is tedious and feels like grinding. Automated some stuff? cool... you still will have to use the stupid trucks or carts and struggle to place stuff on it to go forth and back between your digging site and shops. Pretty much everything feels like it's just there to stretch your playtime. But again, that's up to personal taste I guess.

If Factorio has a rating of like 95%, then this should get a steam rating of around 75% max.

3 years ago I gave this game a somewhat eh. 
After a bunch of updates its much more polished, but can still be a little ruff around the edges.
I however enjoy it a lot more then previously. 

This is in part due to watching streamers (letsgameitout and a few others) brake the game in funny ways. 

I also took up mining for crystals as a hobby, and this game helps scratch that itch when its too cold to do so. 

While building is semi limited, a number of options have been added in to be able to create not only automated mines or farms, but homes as well. I have not delved into this too much yet as im still trying to get a proper mine up and running, but throughout cottage, greenhouse iron, stone, and other building materials I hope to build a Victorian style mansion fit for a mad scientist. a pipe-mancer if you will. 

It still has issues, and some design mechanics I mildly dislike, but it is a good game.
That said, all items are held (expect hats) so its one item at a time and can be a little bothersome for building larger things. pallets, truck beds, and carts exist to help this, but if you need something in bulk its a lot of lugging things back and forth in one format or another. an inventory, or backpack even if it just holds one item at a time, would be nice. Admittedly however if this is a problem, there is a creative mode that allows item duplication.

T0 to T1 is a good grind but T2 and above can be a bit of a grind. in some cases drills can be placed in areas they cant produce stuff in, with the only real restriction being that T1 drills cant produce corestone no matter the dirt. the advantage to this is that drills do not deplete dirt unlike prospecting yourself, but do still need to be on dirt to work. its pretty easy to get a sorting system set up, but the majority of the things you are going to find are gems, gold, and iron. there are two other metals that you need for crafting, a rare gem, and shards. Shards supposedly bring pressure up when used in specific pipes, but iv yet to see them make that big a difference. higher water pressure equates to more speed, but there seems to be a bit of a curve where its diminished returns at some point where the best option is to over pressure pipes as much as possible to compensate. you can add in tanks and shards,, but pipes do not seem to care about flow direction so connecting multiple sections and back pressuring things seems to work. One more aspect to deal with is fixing stuff, but filtering pipes with 5x filters before the water hits the system prevents degrading of the drills. the filters themselves take damage insted, but it is a little esior then having to run around fixing the drills or harvesters individually, being a lot more useful when connected to a lot of things. most things however like convayer belts do not degrade. Thankfully the different pipe types do not seem to matter, its just about pressure loss, the most significant difference being in the intake pipes of different tires. 

At the point im at automation wise, money is no longer an issue, but to mitigate this there are two other currency you can only get by completing NPC quests... as far as I can tell. Its still been pretty fun, but repairing filters and waiting for rare materials to accumulate can stagnate a bit after a while.",1589054904,1699691168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've given this game a pretty solid crack over the years and unfortunately I can't recommend it at all anymore. I was cautiously optimistic that the game would improve and the developers would polish it into a finished product but my patience is exhausted and my faith is lost. This game is incredibly buggy and this review has been edited multiple times. Some of the bugs mentioned may no longer apply but I'm confident they'll be replaced by new bugs. This has been an ongoing trend for years.

Kind of worse, the developer has been reworking a bunch of mechanics from the ""1.0"" release. The game has changed significantly in some ways since I first picked it up. Which makes this review scarily relevant even after all those years. This is still an EA game, masquerading as a finished product.

[h2]The Good[/h2]
Don't let some of the negative reviews about the core mechanics put you off. This is a [b]fascinating[/b] game that makes some bold design choices. The core limitation of only being able to carry one item at a time is extremely immersive and is executed pretty well. I loved the low-poly visuals, and the world feels beautifully designed. This is a great game to play casually when you've got a lot of time to kill and want a relaxing experience. Throw on some chilled music and enjoy.

[h2]The Bad[/h2]
This game is very rough in places. The sound design is just plain awful but that's the least of its problems. Though I strongly suggest muting the soundtrack unless you want brain damage... A major major issue is the physics. It's hilarious how bad it is. There are plenty of physics collisions which will send things flying into the sky. [i]Drove over that tiny rock a bit too fast? Welcome to the stratosphere. Something on top of that bucket you picked up? Well it's now flying away at terminal velocity.[/i]

Vehicle handling is just generally terrible. This wouldn't be such a major issue if hauling items with vehicles wasn't such a major party of the game. I've got used to saving my game for fear of being stuck in an infinite reset loop which throws me into the air the moment I reset, and lands me somewhere I can't move. It's happened fairly regularly every time I've played this game.

A game breaking issue is that you can build things under the ground. Not ground you can dig mind. This in itself isn't a problem but if you can't see the item anymore you can't pick it up. I once lost a stack of 14,000 coins because I accidentally placed it [b]under[/b] the ground when I meant to put it [b]on[/b] the ground. Now that wasn't a big deal since I bet on this happening and split my six figures worth of coins into lots of stacks. Can you imagine this happening if you didn't? Just lost all of your coins? Too bad. That could seriously have ruined hours of play time...

In my latest play through I managed to break sprinting in under 5 minutes of play. The sprint key just wouldn't work. It required a game restart to fix it. I've had enough... I've come back to this game with renewed optimism so many times, only to be beaten down with completely stupid bugs, that I'd class the relationship as abusive.

Game performance is utterly abysmal for what it is. I've run this game on both my mid range gaming desktop and my high end gaming laptop and... it sucks. The frame rate will regularly drop to single digits for a few seconds at a time. There have been serious memory leaks in the past which required a system restart to resolve. The game's practically conditioned me to not use lamps as it one point they would tank the frame rate too. Graphics memory usage has also been crazy at times...

[h2]The Ugly[/h2]
As my title suggests this game is being falsely advertised. Development is still actively underway with new features and bug fixes being intermittently released. Combine that with the aforementioned issues the game has and it's fairly clear that this is still very much Early Access and not a full release. I'm not sure why the developer didn't label this as Early Access other than to give a false impression that it's more finished than it really is.

I recently built a site up to full-scale automation again. What shocked me the most is how many machines have been removed from the ""1.0"" game, only to be replaced by subtly different ones in ""2.0"". What was the point exactly? Just leave the old machine in the game and make a new one. I think this may have been why some of my Steam cloud saves just disappeared. Presumably they weren't compatible with the new release. I don't know if there's a ""3.0"" planned but I expect that to blat my saves too.

All of the new changes feel forced and stilted. Dirt has invisible tiers now. You get to a point where Tier 1 equipment won't work anymore. Pickaxes and miners will just spark. The dirt doesn't look different mind. You just spark instead of going deeper. Pipes can now hold more than 100% pressure and have pressure caps that aren't given in description texts. Does a pump or pipe going over 100% pressure sound stupid? That's because it is. Change % to a pressure unit and it would suddenly make sense. Use bar, PSI, Pa, or even make up your own... These might sound like nit-picks but I think it's a sign the developer doesn't really care. The tier's are an afterthought to artificially pad game time.

[h2]Bottom Line[/h2]
I didn't request a refund for this game because I thought it was kind of fun, and I suspected I'd come back to it fairly regularly. I had hoped that if the vehicle and building mechanics were fixed, along with the performance issues, then I'd give it a thumbs up. Now though... I regret this decision. 

The developers have had a lot of attention via YouTube. They've had a lot of people pay for their game. Years have gone by and it still feels like an Early Access bug fest that's being regularly reworked. Sure there's more content but the game has bugs and an apathetic developer eating at its core.

Don't buy this game. Unless you are happy to put up with a lot of infuriating bugs and a developer who's clearly out to get one over people.",1601324966,1698413214,False,198,13,0.777311384677886963,20,True,False,False

Over two years have passed and since then there have been a few updates and achievements that I wanted to unlock, which is why I started this game again. Unfortunately, the developers still haven't fixed the blocking resources; the only way to remove them is a button in the pause menu that deletes all unprocessed resources. It's not as bad as it was at the time of my original review, but it still happens regularly.
Since there is no inventory, all items have to be transported by cars (or carts in the early game). But if you put a not particularly large amount of items on the loading area, the game starts to lag when you drive. Buying the items one by one is already a farce, and unfortunately so is transporting them, even if you ignore the physics errors when driving at low FPS.

Another problem is money. As soon as a halfway large setup has been built, money problems no longer exist, you don't know where to put all the resources, since once the setup is in place, only the filters need to be repaired every now and then (or the spanners need to be refilled once the repair has been automated). With the last updates, two other currencies were introduced in addition to the normal money. You only get these through quests, which NPCs give you. I assume that this was to curb this abstruse overflow of money by reducing the amount of money that the player can earn in a certain amount of time, because the quests don't spawn very quickly and only give limited money. Unfortunately, this makes the whole game even slower than it already is, since important items for the farming aspect can only be bought with this new currency. Especially the prices for farming equipment are completely idiotic. A single sprinkler (to water plants) costs almost as much as a vehicle that can harvest and sow plants. Additionally, nothing can be automated to obtain these new currencies except for gathering large amounts of the basic resources. You always have to pick up the quest, create the random item and bring it back to get a marginal amount of money. 

All in all, I can only say that the game is a real pain without mods. Unfortunately, mods lead to Steam Achievements no longer being unlocked, which is why you have to go through the whole thing at least once if you want to get the Achievements. In principle, I would say that the most useful feature in the future would be an inventory system, and I'm not sure I'd bother playing the game again without one. I also stand by my conclusion from the original review: the early game is fun, but the mid to late game is unpolished. Unfortunately, my hopes that this game would be better were not fulfilled, which is why I changed my review from a ""would recommend"" to a ""would not recommend"".

It's not even that the game is bad, but the mechanics break it.

[h1]Old Review (16th Feb 2021 @ 35h)[/h1]
So the first few hours are really fun, from digging by hand to getting the first automated rigs. However, there are a few things that fall apart when your rigs get bigger and the amount of goods you get exceeds some amount.

I just have 35 rams that dig on the surface, all dirt gets processed, the goods get filtered and smelted. All works without a problem until the smelting part. Ores get stuck at the side of the conveyor belts, at the exit of the sorter, the melting plants, the logic smelting plants and even in the funnels. If you do not catch that immediatly thousands of ores will be blocked because of that one stuck ore and any attempt to remove that blockade will either drop your FPS way below 1, crash the game or spread all the ores over the whole island as the physics just 'explode' the ores when touching one of them.
So I am sitting there on the ""South Hope"" field and can not even use all of the 35 rams (which is nothing compared to the size of the field ) as 1 blocked ore can already destroy everything. All of these rams would easily fit on the first field so I do not really see the reason to buy a bigger field except to dig lower and get bigger ores.
Maybe it would already be enough to join the ores like the dirt does at the moment and to not cap the ore size but to do it like the bars which do not grow in size after some point but get heavier. That would reduce the problems caused by the stuck ores (as that would stay 1 ore but bigger and way heavier) and might even reduce lag when handling ores by hand if anything happens. Keep in mind that bigger ores are already a thing when mining deeper so it would only make sense to be able to join smaller ores.
Another point of trouble is the magnet. While it does help a lot collecting all of the ores that flew over the whole island even after dropping all the ores it keeps lagging until i do not hold the magnet in my hand anymore. When I pick it back up the lag returns though. Same thing happens with the world save, after some time the game gets laggy which can be fixed by quiting to the game menu and loading the world again. 
Another thing that annoyed me is that you need to check your filter every now and then which is okay, but in my opinion it happens way too often and with the basic filters the water damages your machines if unfiltered water gets in some machines. Especially since you need five of them in early game but only one powered filter later on. The powered filters stops the water flow if the filter breaks so it gets better in the 'mid' game (there is some automatic repairing logic in late game) but it could be better.
Also the money should be no item that you literally need to carry around. While I understand the reason it just makes everything so much slower, a money system outside of physical items would be way better (but is fairly subjective so I understand if there are people prefering the current money method).
All in all it is a fun game but the mid to late game seems unpolished, the bugs I encountered are game breaking and should not exist in a full release. Maybe the developers thought one would get the better drill fairly early and instead of going on a large scale with small ores one would go smaller scale with big ores in the lower parts of the fields.

Those are the problems I encountered apart from some minor physics shenanigans and apart from those I really enjoyed the game. It is fun and has an awesome setting which kinda reminds me of minecraft in a more realistic and 'advanced' world than minecraft itself. So while this review might sound negative I want to stress that I really enjoyed this game and want to see what happens with it in the future. I would rate it with a 6.5-7.5/10 in its current state but it can clearly get way more than that in the future.",1613436706,1698189870,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

(rly feels bit like a scam)
maybe its because he wanted/needed to earn even more money and said ""hey, lets try if i can port this to console. i never tried that before and i rly like like to. haha""
watching pics and vids from players in discord showed me everyone is kinda building the same big racks of miners without sense because of the game's lacking a real goal to go for and complexity/depth. (there is none!)
only buy, if you want to support the dev in practicing and educating his game-programming-skills.
its started with one operson and a great idea, but after what i saw and read on discord its seems the game wont get much more changes in future and the dev is talking about another ""game"" hes working on. so it looks like a 20$/€ game, but misses so much, it  should cost only 3-5 or so.

Half-Baked fits the game and dev very well i guess... sry tailor,...but not this way....


2 months later: all you gotta do is watch the achievements: 16,1% reached the 1st(!!) achievement and sold something to a shop/earned coins. so more than 4 of 5 players did not even play this game longer than 10-15 minutes! discord also is kinda dead. didnt see the ""dev"" since the last update. tbh - after watching the videos and then playing this ""game"", I just feel scammed.

It isn't dynamic, there's no survival aspect, nothing that adds a sense of urgency to the game. It's well and truly a sandbox game. However, that's not to say that the game lacks anything in any of those departments. There's a sense of realism, albeit not entirely, that Makes the game somewhat charming. There's no fast way to do anything, which I think is wonderful. You're forced to take things slow and be methodical about the processes you use, whether it be manually mining ores and gems to clean and refine, or creating massive foundries to automate the work for you. The lack of an inventory adds to the realism, making it so you can't just load yourself down with countless materials and machinery, expediting a process that doesn't really have an end goal. In short, if you have the patience to just relax and allow yourself to be carried by the pace the game sets for you, this is a wonderfully perfect game to wind down with and just chill for a few hours.

-There's no inventory. You can only manipulate 1 item at a time.
-When buying something you must carry 1 thing at a time out of the shop. Take for example when going to the ice helm, you travel down into the mountain, you buy a conveyer belt, you must carry your gold back to your vehicle, run back, carry the conveyer. I imagine the person who created the inventory system has never played a video game.
-You move insanely slow and running doesn't seem to increase your speed any.
-The construction system is highly flawed. You must build your equipment on different levels however there's no effective grid system, If you watch this game online you see people with tons of stuff, It took them hours just to line up one mining to cleaning system.
 This game is very much overrated trash until its updated to modern day stuff. If you have played factorio or satisfactory especially this isn't the game for you.

Positives:

-Nice graphics and a good color palette.
- Runs well if you stick to basic mining setups.
- Can be fun to begin with building your mining and drilling operation.
- The open world is pleasant, not too big, not too small.
-Good for people who just like to build stuff and see how it works, a sandbox for messing around with no necessary aim, just to build better systems and bases. Those who don't care for the story or any meaningful objectives.
-Better with mods; if you're into modding, then you will be happy to know these improve the base game significantly.

Negatives:

- No inventory; you have to pick up and drag everything around one by one like real life. But unlike real-life backpacks and logical ways to carry tools don't exist for some bizarre reason. You have a useless cart and a tractor that are difficult to load items onto; that's it. This becomes a serious pain in the butt and is a great example of why an inventory is revolutionary to video games. This game mechanic means everything takes 50% longer than it really should, a nice cheap way to inflate the gameplay time. Lugging large drills and machinery around from one corner of the map to the next is just awful.
- Grinding repetitive gameplay.
-Picking up and dropping items is very poor, you have a poor marker displayed where things will land. No logical way to just place an item down gently, all items are thrown like you are controlling an angry Neanderthal man. 
-No proper map or UI; the in-game map is a ridiculous joke.
-Severe lag when you get to mid-game; the game limits what you can build as it cannot handle a few items on conveyor belts without having a nervous breakdown. This makes the game ultimately pointless if you are restricted to small builds but lots of plots and lands to build on that cannot be used.
-No real objectives or goals in the game; your job is just to build and mine and have stacks of money you can't buy anything useful with. You have tasks from citizens to build daggers, swords, or cook foods, etc., that are basic and repetitive, and that's about it; no story, no competition from other miners. Nothing!
-There are only 6 resources: Iron, Gold, cloutmium, corestone, shards, and gen stones. No option to make or manufacture other ore or metals; that's all you get, which is a very small amount compared to other factory games and gets boring fast.
-The playable character seems to find it impossible to put items down, and you have to do a little jump and then press the drop button before he is willing to let go; he constantly makes an 'umm, umm umm' noise to tell you he cannot understand how to let go of an item. This gets very annoying after a while. Perhaps having a playable character that has an IQ below 40 isn't advisable!
-The need to use pipes everywhere becomes a chore; I know it's the base of the game being 'hydroneer,' but it feels unnecessary that every part needs a pipe running through it.
-Limited machines and variety; you have a drill, pipes, grinder, and conveyor belts. You have three tiers of these items, which are a chore to reach.
- The item snapping is very poor; the game should automatically detect which way to place something, but you have to manually rotate each and every piece.
-'Logic,' which was added in later updates, isn't particularly necessary, and you only need to use a fraction of it.
- Poor tools; no proper terraforming options. The pickaxe and shovel, etc., are just awful to use and take huge amounts of time to dig. You can't select terraforming sizes or anything; a huge negative.
- Vehicles are useless; awful controls and diggers and terrain levelling vehicles are frustrating and a waste of time.
- No true automation; things break and need repairing no matter what, even when using logic auto fixers, which need restocking with tool bags (which is a huge pain).
-Farming that has been added to the game is interesting but really just the same as mining and just as irritating.

All in all, I would rate this game a 5.5 out of 10. Mildly interesting, but gameplay gets boring, the mechanics are frustrating, and it has a lot of bugs and lag that ultimately make the game unplayable after mid-game. Probably the worst factory-style game I've played in several years.

A bit confused about how anyone finds this greatly enjoyable, but I guess it has a niche audience, those who prefer grinding and messing around types of games and see poor controls and mechanics as a challenge.

Good game. Starts slow, but once you get the mining and farming going, you can make some crazy cash.
Definitely needs some optimization, though. Objects will destroy your frames.

The DEVs need to come up with a better way of tracking individual ores/fish/gems.  Grab a bucket of ore with a couple hundred ores in it and even a good computer will start acting like a 386 and starting chunking along on the graphics.  I made the mistake of letting the emeralds accumulate for too long.  Dumped them into the gem compressor.  My screen has been frozen for over two hours processing all of the gems.  I have been watching the Task Manager just to be sure that it did not lock up.  Just for reference, I have a 3.7 GHz i9 overclocked to 50 GHz, 32GB of RAM overclocked to 40 GHz, two NVMe drives and an RTX2070 Super, so the system is no slouch.  Highly recommend setting up automation to reduce the item counts as much as possible.  Run ores directly into Smelters, gems directly into gem compressors and chopped vegetables directly into the Cut Veg Stacker.  It is soooo much easier moving around a 2000 weight iron bar than moving around 2000 iron ore.  You have been warned.   :-)

""Hydroneer"" is a delightful sandbox simulation game that allows players to dive headfirst into the world of small-scale mining and entrepreneurial ventures. Developed and published by Foulball Hangover, this game offers a unique and relaxing experience that lets you build your mining empire from the ground up.

The premise of ""Hydroneer"" is relatively simple: you start with a small patch of land, a few basic tools, and a dream of striking it rich in the world of mining. The game's open-world sandbox environment provides you with the freedom to dig, mine, and explore to your heart's content. As you gather resources like gold, gems, and precious metals, you can refine them and turn a profit to expand your operations.

One of the game's most notable features is its impressive physics system, which adds a layer of realism to your mining endeavors. Using various tools and machinery, you can dig, excavate, and transport materials in a way that feels satisfyingly tactile. The sense of progression in ""Hydroneer"" is incredibly rewarding, as you gradually upgrade your equipment and expand your operations to tackle more challenging mining sites.

The game's visual style is charming, with a bright and colorful aesthetic that contrasts nicely with the gritty world of mining. The world is filled with interesting locations to explore, from picturesque valleys to underground caves. The day-night cycle and weather effects also add to the immersion, making each mining expedition feel unique.

While ""Hydroneer"" offers a relaxing and enjoyable experience, it's not without its challenges. Managing resources and optimizing your mining process can be complex, and the game doesn't hold your hand. It encourages experimentation and learning from your mistakes, which can be both rewarding and frustrating at times.

Multiplayer mode is another highlight of ""Hydroneer."" Playing with friends can turn mining into a cooperative and enjoyable experience, as you work together to tackle larger mining operations and share the rewards.

In summary, ""Hydroneer"" is a hidden gem in the world of sandbox simulation games. It offers a refreshing take on the mining genre, combining a relaxing atmosphere with satisfying gameplay mechanics. While it can be a bit daunting for newcomers, the sense of accomplishment and the joy of building your mining empire make it a worthwhile investment of your time. If you have a penchant for entrepreneurship and don't mind getting your hands dirty, ""Hydroneer"" is well worth exploring.

As expected of a game of this type, it's a grindy resource management game that allows you to build creative, yet basic factories which at the late game allows you to fully automate and provides new tools for your mine/farm to make you're job much easier. it doesn't hold your hand and let you explore and learn how to play at your own pace however, here comes the problem, there's no real payoff to your work and while it's fun to build and try to maximize your profits, there's little to no incentives available to do so, especially with the lack of a story or other overarching challenge system. outside of just a lack of incentive, the grind is incredibly real, it provides a real problem as the controls are clunky and you have specific rules you have to follow when transporting materials, even worse you can't carry more than one item, and the physics of the game with an off-center drop marker make it challenging to progress without spending hours just getting materials in and out of buckets with each tiny piece of the ore having to be moved 1 by 1. I would not suggest the game to most people, however those who like the grind and don't need a major pay-off to enjoy themselves, then this game is still a really fun game. in the end, I will have to put a thumbs down, but I have to say, I will likely play more of it waiting for some updates or messing around with workshop items.",1696439727,1696439727,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll say this - the middle and ending to playing this are so bad that you will question your life choices. There are no ""rewards"" - no ""why"" to what you're doing or why you're making money. Why farm and mine? So you can farm and mine more.

Also, a side note - it is incredibly labor intensive to do farming - hours and hours and you'll never unlock an easier way to gain the rewards farming nets you. Don't even start.",1696214162,1696214162,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It starts out slow because all you have is a shovel and bucket but over time it'll speed up and before you know it your able to enjoy a simple farming life while your drills gather minerals for you as you go around and give people what they request from you. There's also something for those of you who like to fish there's a simple fishing mechanic which is easy to grasp. There was a time where the game was rather buggy and we had to find interesting ways to stop ores and gems flying everywhere but now those bugs are gone and the game is a much more peaceful and simpler game but it's still the wonderful mining game i've known and loved playing for the past 3 years. I would suggest for those starting out this game as it is now get a feel for how it is now and if you want try the older versions of the game you'd be surprised by the difference in well everything. If you read this, thank you for taking the time to i appreciate it and if reading what i have to say has encouraged you to at least try Hydroneer then i'm happy because that's one more miner, fisher, gardener or even quest completer than has discovered Hydroneer and the beauty put into it.

This is a survival / crafting / open world game. You dig, you buy + sell, you build. It's exactly the sort of game that I spend most of my time with. However, it is critically flawed: there is no inventory. You can hold just one thing at a time. The developers have provided carts + trucks that you can use to move items in bulk, but they're clumsy and slow. 

The core mechanics of the game are good, but the lack of an inventory system dooms players to wasting a non-trivial portion of their in-game time on tedious / pointless make-work exercises. I _like_ digging + building. I do not like picking up 30 pipe pieces at the store, one at a time, dropping them into a cart, and then unloading them, one at a time, at my dig site. I'm only a few hours in; I've set up a tier-1 auto-digger. I've read online that the time wasted on clumsy handling of items only increases as players progress in the game.

It's a real shame, but the 80% fun of the game is inseparable from a miserable 20% that devolves directly from the lack of an inventory system.

Hydroneer, developed by Foulball Hangover, is a unique and relaxing sandbox game that invites players to immerse themselves in the world of small-scale gold mining. As someone who has spent hours panning for gold and crafting intricate machinery, I'm excited to share my review of this charming indie title.

Gameplay (4.5/5):
Hydroneer's gameplay centers around the art of gold mining, offering a serene and surprisingly addictive experience. You begin as a humble prospector with basic tools like a shovel and a gold pan, but as you dig deeper into the earth and uncover the precious metal, you can expand your operations with increasingly complex machinery.

The game's progression system is well-balanced. It encourages you to start small, learning the ropes of prospecting, before gradually advancing to more efficient and automated methods. The satisfaction of discovering a valuable nugget or a rich deposit of gold is immensely rewarding.

Graphics and Sound (4/5):
Hydroneer adopts a minimalist yet visually pleasing art style. The environments are colorful and serene, with clear water bodies reflecting the surroundings beautifully. The physics-based interactions, such as digging and water flow, are well-executed and add to the immersion.

While the game's sound design is functional, the soothing music and ambient sounds contribute to the relaxing atmosphere. The gentle sound of running water and the hum of your machines create a tranquil backdrop as you work on your mining endeavors.

Crafting and Machinery (4/5):
One of Hydroneer's strengths is the crafting and machinery aspect. As you progress, you can design and build intricate contraptions using a variety of components. From water pumps and sluice boxes to conveyor belts and heavy machinery, the options for customizing your mining operation are extensive. Experimentation is encouraged, and watching your creations come to life is immensely satisfying.

The crafting system is intuitive, with a straightforward interface that allows you to assemble and disassemble components easily. The sense of creativity and problem-solving it offers is a highlight of the game.

Community and Modding (5/5):
Hydroneer benefits from an active and creative modding community. Players have developed a wide range of mods, adding new content, machinery, and even additional gameplay elements. This extends the game's longevity and provides a platform for players to share their creative mining setups.

Conclusion (4.5/5):
Hydroneer is a delightful and relaxing sandbox game that offers a unique take on the world of gold mining.

Same way with anything else, it's so counter-intuitive it hurts. Tutorial is also lacking. The guy who wrote the tutorial is assuming the player that just bought the game has some sense of the game so it's frustrating to try and understand what's going on. Physical money that's tiny and you have to actually carry it around? Why? Yet another thing that just doesn't make sense!! Final part of the tutorial you put down a water pipe and a conveyor belt but sike you can't rotate the pipe or belt to actually fit it to the machine. I know this game could be so great and it's why I'm upset. I've been looking at the game for a while and finally decided to pull the trigger but this dev is playing Rodman-like defense making sure I don't enjoy the game.

Edit response to the developer:

While I appreciate the speedy response I won't be changing my review.  You don't have to hold someone's hand to make the game make sense.  You're taking away basic essential parts of literally every other game in the sake of being ""different."" 

I read every text in the tutorial that I could, sometimes the text changed quickly from task to task so I totally could've missed something.  Multiple times I was looking into the controls menu but couldn't find what I was looking for so I was left pressing random buttons on my keyboard.  Is that not a problem? I've been gaming for 20 years and if I'm having this much of an issue, inside of a tutorial, that's an issue.  I know I'm harping on this one thing, but the whole idea of a beginners guide... is to guide a beginner slowly through each aspect of the game so they can enjoy everything you've worked so hard on, correct?

I realize you're not going to change your entire game because of one review, but the mindset of ""it's fun because it's hard!"" is a sad way to think.  Quality of life can co-exist with difficulty.

Again, I really wanted to enjoy this game and I would love to try it again in the future. I don't leave comments or reviews hardly ever, but felt so strongly about this one that I had to.  I appreciate your effort crafting the game and your quick response to any criticism.",1694525437,1694622354,False,1,0,0.476510077714920044,0,True,False,False

the start grind is fine, the graphics are nice, the way you make your own items later in the forge etc, is fine and the way you approach the landscape and the challenges is also fine. but the UI!    urghhh easily the worst I have seen in a game with this quality. so many frustrations that do not need to be there. that have grown worse as time has gone by because the developer seems to think that a flaw can be fixed by added further tedium! 

problems:
the buying items malarchy;
when you get into buying later on, it literally is a horrible system - placing items on a pad, placing coins in a bucket then buying them, then filling your vehicles is such a chore. why can't i just select what i want - how many i want and then have the chap I am buying them from auto load my vehicle? its cute to throw things around at the beginning but after a while it just annoys me - make a shopping list and just do away with the silly pick up put down pick up put down nonsense. even an upgrade is fine - so what if I have to have to buy an 'order list maker' or a 'load my truck for me' machine - just make it straight forward!

Constantly pressing the wrong control;
Placing items and rotating them is fraught with the constant pressing of the wrong button because there is no in game consistency and you move something that you didn't want to and then it won't go back - yes I know there is a locking hammer - but there's my point entirely. If you want to lock a design down so you don't accidentally move it, you are just putting a plaster on a rash and making it itch more! if the answer is running around hitting everything to stop it being picked up, The problem is, it shouldn't be that simple to pick something up in the first place so close to all the other key or mouse presses. so many construction games have this right, this game however does not.

I can't help but think that an item shaking visually- and then say holding for a couple of seconds to pick it up properly, so you have the realisation when you 'don't want to pick it up' that you can stop holding the key or the mouse to let go, is a better solution than adding more and more plasters every time the game seems to have an irritation that then becomes a major wound. It requires a major fix to the core interface to solve these issues - not more plasters or further tedium.

Making items feels like my hands are made from potatoes!;
the visual chalk on the anvil that's a pain to get your head around, then the fact you need a hammer - but, get the right hammer not the other hammers that do different things! lol its so daft. here is a solution: you go to the anvil, you select what you want from a floating menu. you add your ingredients because the menu tells you what you need, you have them nearby in a vehicle because you brought them already and thats what a vehicle gives you as an advantage over you not having one. You transfer them to the anvil via the menu. you then tick make item and bam - it uses up the ingredients, you get your item placed in the vehicle. So much easier! i'm constantly dropping bars on the floor on the scale or the anvil to eyeline a dot that sometimes is there and sometimes isn't and sometimes is affected by physics and sometimes isn't, arggh frustration. I understand the dev doesn't want a traditional 'inventory' because you can only carry one item, but the vehicles lend themselves to being that very inventory this game so badly needs anyway, nah, I'll just keep balancing things on things that are skinny to make things I then 'run' to the shop with, because loading and unloading a vehicle is so irritating I tend to just avoid it all and walk to a shop. 

Damn, I love the concept of this game and the tier mechanics and even the exploring, so I still recommend it, but I can't help be be frustrated by the 'originally' flawed UI not being fixed over and over by rethinking it somewhat rather than just adding things like a lockdown/unlock hammer, when there are several different hammers already! its almost laughable how the issues are all solved by adding more issues. 

I keep coming back to it - because I want it to be right but the UI literally gives me jaw ache when it frustrates me sooooo much. i don't want to run up and down a street, jumping higher and higher in my truck bed trying to add things that clash with things already in it!. Slap a canvass roof on it and make the contents 'virtual' if it is an issue with bounding boxes. To the game does it really matter if i want to take something from a to b? that it stays fixed awkwardly in the back of a truck and has zero physics? - that i have to bounce myself with space in the truckbed with the annoying 'duh' noise grates me soooo much more! yes its me thats stupid, duh!. if throwing things even added to physics I would tolerate it - but it doesn't, because physics is only there to annoy you sometimes when you drop a water bucket, its not there to be fun, and it doesn't add to the gameplay.  I drive into a bucket at 100mph and my truck stops dead - did i mention the bucket is in the air because I overloaded the truck 10mins earlier because I jumped too high to get it in the back last drop off? If physics was a thing, that items being a thing too makes it fun - imagine pushing the items you bought with the truck into the mine or store you just made?. You can't sadly - so why the physical item in a world where it does nothing but add to the repetitiveness of loading unloading bouncing and dropping. I only need a real item that is unaffected by physics, when I come to build with it. It smells like an original idea that was kept for the wrong reasons and as time has gone on, its a smell that follows you around, actively mocking you.

buy it because at its core it is a brilliant game and a great idea - but please moan about the same things that annoy you, because they will never get fixed unless the developer realises they could do this in a way that is much more fun and much more usable.",1694344062,1694345734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have had 2 saves (that I've put a lot of time into) ruined because I've had mods enabled for another save, so i had to restart a third time if i hoped to get any achievements.

Hydroneer wants to be a mining and exploration game. Except there is effectively nothing to explore worth noting and the mining is rudimentary ""right click-make block disappear"".

Hydroneer wants to be a construction and creative sandbox building game. But the items they give you to work with are bland, limited and have had almost nothing done with or added to them since their initial introduction back in the beta.

Hydroneer wants to be an automation and factory game. But there are no production tiers or choices. Every single setup makes the same production line of drill>harvester>>gem polisher>smelter/gem crusher. There is no variation and almost no thought that goes into it.

Hydroneer wants to be a prospecting game. But the prospecting is bland, rudimentary and monotonous. Money is extremely difficult to acquire early on in the game spending hours panning and prospecting for tidbits of materials. Then, at a specific point of progress you reach a critical mass and get your first automated mining production line set up. Money instantly transforms from being your most hard fought and won commodity into being completely worthless as you begin generating literally millions of coins a minute automatically. Nothing costs anywhere near that much either.

Hydroneer wants to be a farming simulator and an RPG, but it was built off the engine designed for mining and automation with farming being inexorably tied to RPG questing. The process is even more tedious as crops use a separate currency where you have to run to villages who ask for arbitrary recipes with exact amounts of specific vegetables and offer amounts of tokens so small they often don't cover the cost of what they ask for, let alone be worth your effort to fulfil their request.

I'm half expecting the next big update to try and introduce FPS elements. In short, the game doesn't know what it wants to do with itself and none of it is fun. Let this game serve as a cautionary tale. Try to do everything and you will succeed at none of it.",1694184250,1694184250,False,12,4,0.574364066123962402,0,True,False,False

Fishing was great trying to get that best fishing pole. Farming was okay, but was WAAAY more tedious because crops yield so little and the token quests very quickly ramp up to require no many tomatoes and carrots. You hate it because you have to make such a huge farm with no real way to automate it. Sprinkler range sucks so you have to rig a drip system to water plants and with a huge farm being a necessity so is the lag from 1000 drops falling. Having to tear up and replant after each...and...every... harvest is so.... UGH!

Then one day it hits you, farming is actually the best part of the game because it takes soooooo long to max out. You suddenly realize that your mining has been automated for a while and the only thing left to upgrade on it is to get corestone pipes from grinding quests, but what's the point? Your tier 1 and 2 pipes have been mining the whole time you've been fishing and setting up a massive farm. By the time you get back to maxing mining you have literally 1,000,000 kg of bars sitting in your smelter to use on quests. Why do you need faster pipes? So you go back to fishing, only to realize that once you have the max level fishing pole there's nothing else to do. Not to mention the max fishing pole really doesn't make any difference and only took about 30 mins TOPS to aquire. Aside from catching slightly larger fish it does nothing. By this time there's no point to catching larger fish because your mine has already allowed you to sell a 500k gold bar, 50k corestone, 250k emerald necklace and you're sitting on a million+ hydrocoins. Now all that's left is farming and the lag from your drip system makes it unbearable.

In short this game was super fun and absolutely worth the cost. I had such a blast!!! I highly recommend it to people. But it is very bittersweeet. I want to keep playing, I want to unlock new stuff and make a different type of mine, but there's no point. It's like playing a game in creative now and the mechanics of logic are WAAAAAAAAAAY too convoluted to make machines. Seriously YouTube logic setups and see how ridiculous even simple machines are. I saw older videos of content that I wish was still in the game. The wall of items you have to build to unlock the next was nice, make that and let that be the way that you unlock tier 2 and 3 equipment, instead oif just putting it behind a VERY easy to achieve coin cost. Using your resources to upgrade the towns and add new npcs or unlock a progression tier or materials to build with would be great. How about locking the purchase of all the mining areas and forcing people to do one at a time, each with its own unique challenge instead of just a cosmetic difference. Give fishing an actual point, give us fishing quests, require fish for upgrading stuff/nps/towns. 

Again I love the game, absolutely recommend, just be warned once you gets to tier 3 dirt and put down your first mining drill, the game is over.",1693612256,1693612447,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like the new T3 Mining system, and the Token Quest system ramps up nicely the more quests you do - the average quest for me now is an average of about 2000 prospector tokens, but it starts off at a few hundred initially.

The Farming quests/tokens are another story though. I played around with farming 4 or 5 months ago and the same issue exists today. After many rounds of quests, the token reward is still sitting at about 200 tokens per quest (except the one castle quest).

So glad they put in achievements within the game.  Understandably they were hesitant as it is a sandbox at heart, but the achievements guide you through all aspects of the game.  After 100% completing, you will get to experience everything from (almost) the deepest levels of mining, numerous vehicle types and capabilities, NPC interactions, 3 different currencies, all the different mining locations, cooking, and fishing.  Btw, a big hint on the fishing master achievement ... it's all in the rod. ;)

If they ever make a hydroneer 2, things I'd love to see include: all the things in hydroneer 1, lab research and related unlocks, different engine that handles the number of resources generated better (gem compressors and smelters in your conveyor belt line are your best friend!), and deeper NPC interactions.

You start wit a tiny bucket, big bucket and brush.
You get tiny bucket and fill it up with dirt before dropping it into big bucket
throw the tiny bucket into the river until its tiny bucket belly is full of water before dropping it into big bucket
little scrubby scrub and you have got ores
take it over to the local jeweller and drop the bucket on the counter and sell

It's like watching a mining-themed sitcom, complete with hydro-powered machines and primitive tools duking it out for the best gags! Bravo, Max, bravo!

Now, let's dive deep into the game itself. Hydroneer isn't just about digging; it's about digging with style! With a state-of-the-art voxel terrain system, you'll be creating cave networks, quarry pits, and even mud mountains! It's like Bob Ross meets Minecraft in a wild, artistic adventure. Happy little mining machines, everyone!

And hold your prospecting helmets, folks, because this game ain't just about digging mindlessly! Oh no, Hydroneer is a true tycoon-style experience. Build structures, manage hydro pipes, and control pressure like the mining maestro you were always meant to be. Who knew mining could be so sophisticated? adjusts monocle

But wait, there's more! Hydroneer introduces NPC and farming mechanics, turning your mining venture into a thriving community of soup-cooking, jewelry-crafting villagers! Move over, Gordon Ramsay, because we've got miners-turned-chefs in the house!

And let's not forget the latest updates, folks! We now have Ore Veins, making resource hunting more thrilling than ever! I can see it now: miners racing against each other, shovels flying, and a massive gold rush ensues. Hilarity guaranteed!

Oh, and how about that Hydro Mole? No, it's not an underground spy agency, though it might be as sneaky! This versatile digging machine has locked angles for easy navigation, perfect for digging up, down, or even straight into a comedy gold mine!

And hold your pickaxes, there's a mainline quest too! Progress through Bastion Keep, complete a quest for the king, and get a pretty sizable reward! It's like an epic quest wrapped in a humor-infused mining frenzy. Are you laughing yet?

But wait, there's even more! Over 50 Steam Achievements to unlock! Achievements like ""Gold Digger Extraordinaire"" and ""Master of Soup"" will have you ROFL-ing as you conquer the mining world with your wit and charm.

All in all, Hydroneer is an absolute gem of a game! With its active development and Max's vlog antics, it's like a never-ending comedy show that keeps on giving. If you enjoy laughing your way through mining mayhem and hydro-powered hilarity, do yourself a favor and grab Hydroneer now. It's gold, Jerry, gold!",1690745436,1690745436,True,17,1,0.596983253955841064,0,True,False,False

I thought that I'd like it but I guess I was wrong.

Pro:
- You can build machines that do your the job for you
- You can build houses (for whatever reason)

Cons
- Not having an inventory sounds good on paper but makes this tedious busy work
- You are building objects on a grid but the landscape is not grid based which results in shoveling dirt around until something fits
- Money is a level object like everything else which means you have to carry it around to buy stuff (which sounds real) but imagine you can only carry 1 item at a time even money unless you use buckets or something

My main issue with this is the lack of inventory. It makes everything bothersome. Since you can only carry one item in your hands that means you constantly have to drop and pick up items that roll around in the level with physics. You can drop stuff in buckets or on a pallet if the physics decide to play along.
When you want to make a shopping trip you have to put the money in the back of the truck, drive the jelly truck to the shop, put the money in the wood bin, pick up whatever you want to buy from the shelf, drop it on the buy area one by one, push the buy button, pick up the bought items one by one from the buy area onto the back of the jelly truck, pick up the money again, and drive the jelly truck back home. Repeat for unloading and building.

I accept that the dev does not want to use an inventory but I decided that its just not for me then. I wait until there is an inventory either by mod or patch or drop the game entirely",1601362394,1690712347,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
This is a fairly simple game compared to other automation type games like Satisfactory. Makes it easier to pickup and run with. Create a simple design then scale it. 
The addition of farming and fishing elongate the playtime and are enjoyable for a time.
Using Achievements as goals. The game doesn't have a set structure or growth path (could be pro or con based on preference).
A simply good time waster.

Cons:
I'm getting close to 100% achievements and have no use for Tier 3 drills. Maybe this will be addressed in further updates, but a well scaled Tier 2 setup is more than sufficient.
The simplicity can make it seem shallow at times. 5 ores. 4 gems. These all come from the drills and can be sorted using splitters. Even at Tier 1 with 8 spliters you have automated almost the whole mining portion. Tier 2 adds a new ore, which amounts to same basic design but with another splitter. 
Fishing has no automation at all. The fishing pots found what I needed for an upgraded rod or two, but that's it. 
Farming has automation but is prohibitively expense and uses exclusive tokens. 2k for sprinklers, guess I'm drip watering everything. 2.6k for the combine. Will probably be worth it. However, I'm already setup 6 rows of 10, a row for each crop. Not sure it is worth destroying everything for the cool toy.",1690434443,1690434443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- No inventory system. Carry stuff in your hand (singular), or use a cart - that has no space. Luckily, you can clip things into each other...

Goat simulator meets Satisfactory. Crack for the creative OCD autist. 

This game has come a long way in the three years it's been here. I originally gave it a poor review but the devs have seriously improved this to the point where it's downright addictive. 

It takes a special mindset because it's mostly physics based rather than snap and click, even dropping something into a pan requires you to actually aim for the pan or it winds up bouncing on the ground. And there is no inventory, so the world is your playground, there's no ready crafting of tools and storage. You buy the building blocks from storekeeper NPCs. You sell your ""harvest"" be it mineral or plant, buy more equipment to automate it better and fuller.  They added a quest system and some logical unlocks which gives you some direction, though very open ended because, well, you're doing whatever you want. There's plenty of frustration getting things to work the way you want and enough dopamine reward as you progress to make it worthwhile. 

However there's also no health, no fatigue, no hunger, no stats whatsoever. You are constrained by a semi-real physical environment but you aren't going to die, or freeze, or get eaten by bears, or starve. It's just you and a world of resources constrained by game physics. The addiction part is not unlike the infinite clickers that just continue to go up. Except you're building something. Kind of.",1604198558,1690303725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update: After 55 hours of playing Hydroneer, I still cannot stop thinking about, and playing, it! I am brand new to PC gaming. The past 37 years of gaming has been on consoles. You'd think I would be eager to see and play a variety of games on PC, especially genres I could not play on console, but no. I just want to play Hydroneer. I mentioned in the first paragraph that this game can be played mindlessly or intensely, and I think that still holds true. Sometimes I just run about completing villager wants. This doesn't require much thought, so the game is more casual for lack of a better term. Other times I am tinkering with logic and/or working out more efficient ways to mine, farm, automate and produce. To spend hours attempting a build and then see it work is wildly satisfying. Occasionally, a project doesn't work as intended and that is still fun because I get to continue hunting for the solution. There is always a solution (if you think within the confines of the game). Gameplay aside, the game is beautiful and charming. The world isn't large, and it doesn't need to be because you can lose yourself in builds that have small footprints. Additionally, the close proximity to towns is a plus because you will be frequently running to the shops for supplies, tools, and equipment. The building mechanic is pretty good. For the most part I can place items without frustration. The best part of the building mechanic is how everything just seems to line up, which I believe is thanks to the three-dimensional building grid. This is very helpful for a new player of building/automation games such as me. I can put something anywhere within the build area and I know it will connect. It may look ugly, but it will work. Well, I have gone on long enough. If you are considering playing this game, I highly, highly encourage you to do so.

-Having to pick up and carry currency around to drop in buckets to pay for things is quirky but also tedious.
-Not all items in the game can be placed down, some are just dropped from your hand and when dropped they don't fall to the reticle in the middle of the screen, they fall to another reticle that is hard to see unless you edit the graphics settings.
-Not all things can be placed down and it can be difficult to drop them where you want to them to go.
-The day/night cycle is there for ""realism"" but it doesn't actually add or change anything in the game beyond ""its night so its harder to see now""
-The game lighting is not very smooth. If you move away from a lantern you are not facing the lighting will suddenly snap to a darker setting and then if you move closer it will snap back, this is a big jarring to have happen while playing.

I really liked finding ways to perfect my gameplay (going to the store with a cart, filling it up with L-Bend Pipes, purchasing them, Jumping that cart into my truck, filling a second cart with T-Bend pipes, purchasing and Jumping it into the truck, etc.), but that's about the extent of the fun.

The physics are well-realized, but not very realistic and EXTREMELY particular to the Hydroneer universe. The day/night cycle is brutal and the lighting is frankly pretty awful (even with torches/headlamps/etc.) and aggravating.

Overall, I liked learning how to play Hydroneer, but once I was really cruising and raking in the money and guild tokens, I no longer wanted to interact with the janky interface. And that's not true for games like Satisfactory or Hardspace: Shipbreaker.

This game could be fun, but is so, so clunky and unpolished. Every turn, it was like I was fighting with the game to let me play it. Maybe once the game is finished it'll be worth playing, but as-is, it's just frustrating.
 
Some specific issues: There's no inventory. You can hold exactly one item at a time. The map is an item you have to carry with you. Running back and forth to shops takes forever. There's no chest. The game is very resource-intensive. 

Here's the starting gameplay: Pick up your shovel. Dig four scoops into a bucket. Drop the shovel. Pick up the bucket. Walk over to the pan. Try to dump the bucket in the pan. Realize the pointer isn't aimed where you drop things. Get more dirt. Dump dirt in pan. Drop bucket. Pick up pan. Drop pan into river. Pick up pan. Drop pan on ground. Walk over to brush. Pick up brush. Walk over to pan. Click on pan. Drop brush.

Some of the cons I found
1. Your character feels like a plank of wood with a extremely slow walking speed, even sprinting is slow
2. I do not want to carry everything individually, includes money. You seriously keep your money around like an item
3. The world feels void and dead. Like it started as an online game and the player base disappeared
4. The vendors feel so poorly coded, you pick item, place item on table, place coins in basket, and if your coin equals more than item, it's yours. Why not a actual vendor who sells things?
5. The only quests I have come across are making soup bowls. 3 people all asking for soup bowls
6. This game is screaming for some sorta combat
7. The physics are non existent, as long as you get 3/4 wheels on ground you can drive there. I was driving almost straight up cliff walls. Makes the game feel extremely unpolished

I didn't experience a lot of pro's well playing and for me it's pass. This game feels like it needs more time to be fleshed out as a lot of the system in place don't feel refined

Also really watch the videos posted here to sell the game. The videos are cut almost to the point where it shows a game play system, but than the video cuts because you would realise the tediousness off it.

To put it simply, the game is ""Hydroneer"", so you expect mostly mining and crafting, since this is what the game encourages you to do, and what most videos focused on. But the truth is that, in a similar fashion to Slime Rancher, the mining is only a small part of the game that you will quickly automate anyway, meaning that the ""real"" core of the game isn't really the mining but rather expanding your activity in several way (fishing, farming, even cooking), with some really slightly building.

And this is the problem : the progression in the game goes from stupid and mindless to really rewarding. You get to set up automated mining, you get better furnaces to work faster, and so on...
But at the same time, you still have to pick up nuggets after nuggets of ore, individually, because there's no Quality Of Life improvement that improves picking up items and manipulating them. I cannot explain that part really well, but to put it simply, if you played Cooking Simulator, you'll have a hard time getting used to Hydrooner.

Overall, this feel like a game that had little ambition at first, but got bloated with features, no clear roadmap, and quite honestly the translations are below turd.
I was sure this was early access since it suffers from flaws that I saw brought up for The Forest, my biggest surprise was that it isn't, and that it's finished, so so much still feel unpolished, to a point that I'm almost getting angry playing it because I can tell it could be so much better.

Water is widely used and is a very essential resource that you need, it is used to power your machines! Power by water is Hydroneer's main concept after all!
In the beginning, when you progress in mining and make more money, you can automate to make YOUR mining method more efficient, by buying conveyor belts along with other automating tools, like Drills and more! 

Besides automating, base building is an optional part of this game! You can make your way through your factory more efficient, by buying and placing foundations, steps, ramps and more! Speaking of buying, there are various types of markets you can purchase tools, machines, base-building parts, even furniture from, also Jewelers to sell your goods, such as metals you mine, weapons you make in the Anvil(Weapons are only for selling) and jewelry! 

Logic is a very interesting and tricky aspect of this game! Besides automating your factory, you are able to CONTROL your factory with Logic! Switches, Wires, circuits, more advanced machines for higher efficiency,  BOMBS to blast your way through dirt or MINI NUKE to demolish your old base!
Welcome to Hydroneer! What kind of jaw-dropping mining base will you build?

Update-7/12/23 

Hydroneer multiplayer is not at all what it could be, however due to some technical issues, split screen is only available! I am sure that the dev and his team will eventually work a way around this at some point in the future!

The farming update, as well as tasks certainly adds a lot more to do in Hydroneer! I am really loving it!

I give up, uninstalled for good and i never want to hear about this game.

I would love to be able to play but the drop/placement point makes the game unplayable for me, there should an option to disable this, i already saw many people complaining about that but there is no way to fix it even with mods.

You pick up with the blue circle and drop with the black 1, it really doesn't make sense at all.

https://prnt.sc/OTooIfjCF4bU

Would it be so hard to pick up/drop from the same place like every other game.

After playing every game like this it's the first time i see such a weird gameplay feature, even using E to place items becomes a shore.

Mining can be automated, but if you do it the wrong way items will build up and cause serious lag even with a reasonably good computer, farming can't be automated, fishing seems like it can be automated but the sorters don't work properly.  In addition some quests require a certain weight of a single item and there is no way to automate that process.  Many quests request something with a decimal (ex. 3.5 weight) and 3 weight is nearly impossible to find so your only option is to hand sort and weight each item until you find one heavy enough.  If fishing could be automated and weight sorting could be automated this game would be a lot better.  Buying things from stores is also a pain as you have to bring each individual item to a spot to purchase, there is no bulk purchasing option.  Mods have been made to fix most of this but overall it just feels to me like a game only partway done.

According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

his is an early review, which I will update after I have persisted with the game. Initial impressions aren't great but I am hopping it is a grower.

Pros:
* It's an indy game and a lot of effort has been put into the game

Cons:
* Controls and the clunky mechanism to pick up and drop stuff - Someone please tell me that trying to place things into or onto other things isn't some kind of frustrating mini game!
* Dropping money (because you don't have pockets or an inventory) means it will sometimes clip through the floor and be lost forever to the out of bounds gremlins! I have been unlucky and lost two lots of money after moving it out of my pan to find ores at the very beginning of the game, was searching everywhere - I will persist with the game but jeez this is annoying!
* Why do I turn like I'm dragging the cart if I use a controller (but still need a mouse to access settings and menus, that you must use the escape key to escape from because there is no exit menu icon!)
* What does the tutorial actually do that couldn't be done my having pop-ups in the main game - seems redundant and not very helpful tbh
* Runs like a beast with a bad head, I'm guessing the excitement to develop ideas and features has kicked optimization into a corner

I am genuinely hoping that choosing not to refund was a good choice, but I can see this game being battered for refunds in the first few hours if my experience is anything to go by. 

Update - The pros and cons still stand, however using a steam community controller set-up is a must - the controls are still wonky but at least some of the pain is removed. The game definitely gets more engaging once you are building your first set of machines and the rough edges kinda add to the game's charm. This is a fun title to play and helps scratch the factorio [any other resource / builder type game] itch. As a plus I'm also teaching my partner northern English dialect - take a gander!

So why do I think it's not currently worth it?  Well, I had been playing on a save for several days, working diligently on making the forge into an epic base, when all of a sudden Windows crashes.
Computer reboots, and I get the game started back up, and load my save... to find there is nothing there, it's as what was loaded was a brand new save.
While there is a 'backup system', the backup got updated when I went to exit the game, to check the backup, so even that was pointless.

Sure, the existence of a backup system does appear like it was taken into consideration (possibly), but it is impossible to exit the game without using the save buttons in the menu, or force quitting the game, and even then, it may already be too late to use a backup.  Oh, and there isn't multiple backups, there is only 1.

!!! IMPORTANT !!! That being said there are a few things holding this back from being up there with Factorio/Satisfactory/Stardew/etc:

1. Multiplayer coop is splitscreen only. This game would be amazing with friends and seems really strange that this wasnt prioritized over other updates. 
2. Purchasing certain items in mass can only be described as migraine inducing, I dont say this lightly. You should be excited to build your base, it shouldnt be a mundane chore in which loading the truck and unloading is a mess that usually takes longer than actually placing the items where they need to go. 
3. More of a preference but the lack of a tool bar / toolbelt does the game no favors. Having to drop every item on the ground / rack before picking up another item, etc etc gives the game such a sluggish feel to an otherwise fun experience 

The last 2 points are a repellent that does a great job at keeping me from playing this game. I have to really convince myself to put up with the latter in order to enjoy the rest of the game.

A good number of quality of life issues exist in the vanilla game, which are fixed by using the mods available in the steam workshop, some of which were actually created by a Hydroneer dev.

The more I play the more I enjoy this game. The only issue I really have with it is that once you get into automation you quickly have more money than you could ever spend. The economy could definitely use some tweaking, as well as some long term, repeatable goals to keep things interesting once you've got your mine fully automated.

My playtime of over 100 hours is actually 3 play-throughs. Not because I necessarily wanted to start over, I ran out of things to do, but enjoyed the game so much I wanted to start over to give myself goals again.

Only issue I have is that I find the game too easy, usually I can beat the game within 14 hours without leaving the starting plot of Ember Cradle... after you get your first few drills you can pretty much earn 70'000 Hydro coins in about 10-15 mins which is nice but there's not really much intensive to carry on getting the top tier equipment when you can buy everything in the game at that point.

I mean you can set yourself goals to make as much cash as possible but that gets boring in my opinion, I would like to see more industry added to the game with a focus on using your materials to make things like building materials or make complex parts for ships and vehicles etc...

This game have so many quality of life improvements that seems to be overlooked. but it set out to build something and what is expected is 100% there.

Its extremely satisfying finishing a setup and seeing it function. 

Its extremely annoying to see my FPS go to 10 everytime i have to buy more than 10 items of anything. 

So for anyone new, Carts can stack things without collisions after they settle. carts can be placed in the back of your truck. Thats how you purchase and transport things the cheesy way. 

Clear improvements of the game i do not understand does not exist: 
1. Plots having a purchase and delivery station, spawning items without collision on a pallet at your locations (making the pallet remember how many items it has left instead of having to handle 100 individual objects), make the payment of every item 5 times higher to reward players for making something good (and to actually have something to use the millions of coins on)
2. delivery of items is such a pain, make it so people can come pick up their order or something. I want to build not drive around with a soup. 
3. I miss the excavator ... i loved the idea of slowly digging out a plot instead of using the infinete diggers, Even had this cool delivery setup back when it was still in the game. 
4. The anvil ... oh god everyone hate that area, It looks amazing but after you been there once and have to take that damn elevator and transport items you will understand... Quick partial fix, force the elevator to adjust direction to where you are using a trigger. (its always on its way down as your moving around the corner)

But again, in the end its just a chill nice time of a game that rewards you with snowball effects instead of trying to punish you at every corner. which is why ive played it so much and began hunting the achivements.",1687050858,1687050858,True,14,1,0.629330098628997803,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately it causes such severe motion sickness I have no possibility of loving this game.  By the time I threw in the towel and gave up tweaking different settings to see if it made any difference I already had > 2 hours in it, half of which was idle / tabbed out searching for answers, so couldn't refund it or I definitely would have refunded it.  

Now to go hug a bucket for a while until this nausea passes...

UPDATE:  grandmaMax, yes I did all of the above.  I also turned down every detail setting possible and am pushing 120 fps.   I've been able to play longer session with the FOV set very narrow but I'm still rather ill after playing.  I think part of the issue is that it hitches about once a second when moving so it's just not smooth.  I can play 20 minutes, get up and walk away for 10 and come back.  That's about my limit.

I'm changing my recommendation to yes simply because I'm probably a special case + I'm playing in Linux which may be impacting the engine somewhat, but I play a ton of games in linux on this machine that don't have this issue.

Even with the severe frame drops from carrying multiple resources/items at a time, the game is a great experience if you're the type of person who likes to watch numbers go up and work with a tier system with resources and activities. I especially loved the Yorkshire citizens and have expanded my lexicon of slang to annoy my friends with.

My only real complaint is that I wish vegtables grew faster and the cutting mechanics were a bit clearer. I had to run over Louise about six times to get the frustration of wasting 45.5 tomatoes and what I thought was 28 carrots but turned into 26.2 after cutting. Only for her to follow this up by spitting it out and throwing my bowl of scran on the ground like an ungrateful child. This of course happened after the carrots thing had already screwed me up without me realizing it on someone else, and me wasting about 100 pounds of carrots by forgetting to add the tomatoes before putting them into the soup bowl.

All in all though I did enjoy it and I will be purchasing some merch from the store out of appreciation for both the games and the devs sticking to it for this long when a lot of people tend to abandon their games after about a year of release if even that.

Graphics are good, mechanics are interesting. It will take roughly 60 hours causal play to finish king quest and I probably will not play this anymore after that. 

Then why I downvoted? Because in my eyes game have been ruined by very bad decisions. In short time of playing player have enough money to buy basically everything he wants. Which is not bad but there should be introduced more stuff player can spend money on. So intstead of fixing this issue, devs decided to create even more problems by issuing new currencies. And blocked access to new blocks behind quests. I don't know what are they thinking, that from now on every new tier of miners will require new coin type and new quest line? It's terrible decision because instead of adding more sandbox, building, automation elements, they are adding more grind that can't be automated at all. This changed the game from small but good automation game to quest grind fest. And I don't think so players wanted that. I didn't for sure.

On top of that game is not balanced at all. For example, you grind tokens to be able to buy Cropper but when you finally do it, then there is no real need to use it because you don't need more tokens. Sure you could buy greenhouse but there is no real need to have one. Why they simply didn't allowed to buy that Cropper for like 100k creds so you can do quests without so big grind wall is beyond me. 
The prices also feels random because you need to pay 2100 tokens for one sprinkler and 2700 per Cropper? How is that? And if you don't believe me that it's bad, then look at numbers: only 0.3% players managed to grind quests to get Cropper. Which is real shame because it's good machine, that you almost will have no need to use.

Another wierd thing is that some devs are working on mods for the game in their spare time. Why they won't add those items to the game is again, beyond me. Using mods prevents you from getting achievements so I don't want to use them and I expect to have everything in game and not as mods.

Overall I still think that game is promising but I doubt that many things will be fixed which is a shame because this game had a chance to be 10/10 but with it's problems and bad decisions is at most 5/10.

Its even on its lowest setting and is laggy. Explain how a $2.5k PC cant run this on at least 30 FPS? The more annoying things is they dont fix crash bugs, Only little bugs that get you slightly through easier. Its been 2 years.

On top of this, I've never seen such a stable physics based game in my entire life. I'll write this review to be accessible to both Steam tourists and people who've seen hundreds of hours of Hydroneer gameplay on Youtube. 

It's got a steep learning curve with some of the building structure, but once you poke around and explore in the mechanics, it comes naturally. The point of the game really boils down to panning for gold to building monstrous machines that mine resources for you, then min-maxing the efficiency of a machine so it spews out resources like a glittery waterfall. You're also not limited to just mining since in the last half a year, full systems for farming, smithing and fishing have been fully implemented and work like a charm. 

However, you should know before you buy that the developers are very hard-line on their choice to limit automation of machines with the use of machine part breakdowns (for only a few machine parts, but the most essential for automated mining) on grounds that the player should be the most essential tool, and the game can lag something fierce if you overload a bucket with raw resources. 

But, I have a vanilla fix without the use of Steam's Workshop, which disables achievements. They apply at all stages of the game. 

First, lag. Drop resources into auto-smelters and compressors either by hand or with a simple conveyor sorting system. While they are pricey machines at early game, this completely eliminates all lag until very-late game. You can find pretty simple sorting systems on Google and the official Bridgepour wiki that do this for you. 

Second, machine breakdown is a pain in the ass which forces the player to buy and use consumable repair kits to start production again, but Hydroneer has a device called a Spanner Hurling Unit. Point these at your machines and hook it up with logic (electrical) cables. It'll use a consumable spanner to repair the device to full durability. A spanner unit holds 20 consumables. Not enough? Build a conveyor system directly under the Spanner Hurlers and they'll automatically restock from spanner packs rotating on the belt. You'll have to plan this out in advance, but figuring out the weird things in Hydroneer is the core gameplay loop.

- ATV turns over way too easily. It's supposed to be a fast vehicle but unless you're tapping the turn buttons on the keyboard, you're gonna roll over.

- Night cycle last way too long. The day feels 30% sun, 70% night. Yes, I get there are lights and a bed to deal with this, but why not just make it an option? How does a night cycle benefit a player at all besides being a cosmetic feature?

- Picking up stuff with one hand: This annoys me the most. Your character can pick up a huge, bulky machine but can't pick up more than one tomato?

- Starting a garden and trying to water plants is painful. A bucket and pan can only hold 1 instance of water, and said water can only hydrate 1 plant at a time? Why? I wish I would have just done a bunch of T pipes that drips onto plants but I already used my money to buy seeds and plant them in 4x4 pattern.

- I wish quests just had a job board instead of going around, hunting for speech bubbles from villagers, only to find that kind of quest isn't what I want (looking for Farm Tokens, not Guild Tokens).

- The Forge area is unnecessarily large. Yes, it looks cool from an atmosphere perspective, but it's so, so empty. While I appreciate the conveyor belts to transfer items down, I wish I didn't have to go all the way down and realize I needed a cart and then had to carry items 1 by 1 up to the Forge.

- Some prices don't make sense: Like 425 tokens for a wooden palette vs 85 metal pipes at 5ea?

- I really wish my character was taller or could adjust the height of holding the object in my hand. A bunch of items that I wish I could put in the back of my tractor is juuust low enough where I have to jump just to drop the item in the back. Why not have the game automatically account for this?

Ingredients

For the base

150g/5½ oz digestive biscuits (about 10)
75g/2¾oz butter
For the toffee filling
75g/2¾oz butter
75g/2¾oz light muscovado sugar
1 x 397g/14oz full-fat condensed milk (see tip)
1 tsp vanilla extract
For the topping
300ml/10fl oz double cream
3 small just-ripe bananas, sliced
50g/1¾oz dark chocolate, melted or cocoa powder

Method

Line the base of a deep 20cm/8in spring form tin with baking paper.

To make the base, crush the biscuits to fine crumbs and melt the butter over a low heat. Pour into a bowl and mix to combine. Spoon into the base of the tin and press down with the back of a spoon until level. Place in the fridge for 15 minutes.

To make the filling, heat the butter and sugar in a small non-stick saucepan and stir over a low heat until combined. Add the condensed milk and bring to the boil, stirring for 2–3 minutes – do not over-boil or it will become grainy and fudge-like. Add the vanilla and pour into the tin. Place in the fridge for at least 1 hour.

Whip the cream in a bowl until soft peaks form.

Arrange the banana slices in neat rounds on top of the toffee. Spoon or pipe the cream on top and level. Set in the fridge for an hour.

Remove from the tin, and zig zag the melted chocolate over the top or dust with cocoa powder.",1685231500,1685231500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It really clicked for me when I was sorting through a massive pile of ore and realized the benefit of the intentional offset with which you hold things in the game.
When you pick things up, they move to the right side of the screen rather than the middle which you'd expect from most games.

But I picked up a pan, walked over to my pile, and started quickly picking through it grabbing gold chunks and dropping them into the pan one by one. 

And you know what? It felt great. 

Just the simple task operating as you'd expect with an almost lifelike fidelity. It's so simple but also so fun. I look forward to the simplest most rudimentary tasks accomplished through the world rather than menus and widgets. 

There are some allowances in very smart places, like ore dropped in a pan becomes 'Stuck"" to it so if the pan is accidentally flung around, the ore doesn't go flying. Likewise objects dropped in the cart, in the truck or even dropped on a pallet and put into the truck, it all stays together and in some cases can clip through one another. 
This is a place where quality of life matters more than fidelity and it certainly helps.

But sometimes you end up with a huge, frustrating mess. But then you discover there are tools to help with the mess, with preventing it via automation, and a whole nother world opens up. Then you find farming, fishing, and the questing, additional plots, the little towns....

I look with pride at my muddy plot that I finally managed to arrange a shack the size of a spacious outhouse next to a smithing setup and a tool rack. Something so simple but more meaningful than any tier armor set or weapons in most games. My mud hut and hole in the ground are more meaningful than any boss slain and loot gained, because of the painstaking work that felt like it actually was something and meant something.

My only warning is don't let this game prevent you from getting things done in real life. It really scratches that itch of getting things done!",1685021580,1685021580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has come along way from my first review. There are still some glitches here and there but nothing to major. the lag has been reduced by a lot, providing you don't let your raw resources pile up. If you get bored on mining then go farm and if that bothers you go do some fishing and work your way up to the master rod to catch the big fish. my biggest complaint is I cant carry all the different types of money in this game, or a tool backpack.. add this two things and that would be fantastic.


I have played a decent amount in Hydroneer and in the early going i was peeved at my truck getting stuck in the air or the lag fest because of to much gold about. That being said Max has been updating the game and improving and adding and improving and going back a step then improving and here he is adding again (1.6 now) to keep the fun going. I paid 10 dollars for this game and to me its been well worth it. Other may not like this game because of lag at times, random hiccup here and there so before you buy watch a few videos to see if this is the game for you. This game is meant to be a grind at first and you appreciate when you get to start automating your gold mine. keep up the good work and i will support you in your next game endeavor as well. one last note i have got more fun out of this game frustrations and all compared to some triple A titles that cost me 60 bucks.",1610782999,1684877590,True,16,2,0.647847354412078857,0,True,False,False

I really liked the first few hours of the game. You start with a small plot of land, rudimentary equipment and you have to endure through a fidgety process of getting your first few nuggets to sell them. Which is good because it gives you motivation to upgrade. Then you can eventually buy your first drill and bit later even automate the process when your income starts growing. At this point the game starts to focus on scaling and expanding your production. You hit milestones regularly which keep you entertained (carrot on a stick). 

Most of the game mechanics are poorly or not explained at all. On most items you can press a button in-game and it will open the wiki page (which is an awesome feature). Sadly most of the articles are still stubs and you can't get any further information than its in-game description. The game got a big update recently, maybe thats why the wiki is such a mess. I had to get most of my information from youtube videos.

I started the game when quests were already implemented. It was lucky timing, because without those, I would have stopped playing after a few hours already. Once your production is running automatically, you just stand there and wait for it to output the needed materials for the next milestone (another drill, or higher tier equipment). With quests, you have something to do, while your ""factory"" works for you.

Which brings me to the point I totally hated about the game: The item system. You have no inventory, you can only hold one item at a time in your hands (exception is containers which can hold a specific type of items). This makes shopping a tedious nightmare: Take your money stack from your truck, place it in the shop, take one item, place it the ""selling platform"", repeat this for every single item. When you're finished, push the pay button, and take EVERY SINGLE ITEM AGAIN, to put it in your truck. You have to run back and forth so much, it made me furious. I later found out that at most shops you can park your truck partially into the selling zone, so you can put the items directly on it, which prevented me from rage-quitting. I planned a new digsite and had to buy over 100 items, it took ages and was totally not fun. 
Same applies to tools when working: take the shovel, use it, run somewhere, throw the shovel somewhere on the ground, take another tool. Devs please, just give me simple inventory system, let it be a tool belt I can buy and a pouch which holds the different currencies. Its not a unique selling point feature, if it just decreases quality-of-life. When shopping, let me specify how many of that item I want to buy and let me get a stack or just automatically put them in my truck. When unloading the truck the whole process starts again.

Another feature, which makes absolutely no sense and takes a lot of time to get used to, is how items hold are dropped. They are not dropped at the place of your mouse cursor, but somewhere off in your up-right corner of the screen. It displays a faint shadow were your items will be dropped, which is very hard to see most of the time. You frequently drop stuff at the wrong location and you have to pick up every single resource one-by-one (especially placing items on an anvil or a table correctly is a challenge every time). Most of the cases you can use the magnet to fix this mess, but that is also fiddly and not fun.

The steam truck, my lovely steam truck. Its really fun to speed across the map with your Mk. II. Apart from the times, when its not. Every single nook will result in getting you stuck and you have to back up. The streets can be very narrow (or the truck is simply to big). On streets, you will frequently crash into the lamp posts. If you try to build streets or bridges for your truck with building parts, it can easily get stuck on its edges and only deleting those parts can unstuck it. This applies to all vehicles in the game.

Fishing is ok, i guess. It has no influence in game, there are no quests or similar fishing requirements to progress( with one infuriating exception). Early you can earn a bit coins on the side, to boost your income. it becomes inefficient pretty soon (even with the highest tier of fishing rod). [spoiler] I spent two hours fishing for that damn lobster, that you need to complete the last quest to reach the king. To no avail, they were all too small. I quit the game thanks to that damn quest [/spoiler]

Performance can be a problem. You collect 60 minutes worth of crystals in a cauldron, because you dont have auto-smelting yet? Say goodbye to your framerate. You put about 50+ items in the back of your truck while shopping. Goodbye framerate. Game freezes randomly for 1-2 seconds? Oh, autosave. You build a complicated pipe setup (because irrigation upgrade is expensive as hell) to water your crops? The 30 waterdrops hitting the ground will kill your framerate too and the sound effect is annoying as well

Also a new feature added just recently is crop farming. I had no fun at all doing that. The quests for farming (which has an own currency) give way too few coins for the effort and time you have to put in it. The higher tier crops take about 30-45 minutes to grow (or longer, i dont know. I minimized the game and returned after a few episodes on netflix). It literally feels like watching gras grow. Even the harvest machine could not save me from disappointment. It greatly increases your speed at sowing and harvesting, but it does not invalidate the fact, that you have to wait way to long for the crops to grow. The harvesting machine was bumbing around when driving over your crop field which resulting in spilling some of it out your machine. It has a useful output pipe, to put your crops from the machine onto a belt e.g. but somehow it kept ""drifting"" while doing it, so I had to reposition the machine every few seconds to not miss the belt. 

In summary: I was bored enough to play this game for almost 80 hours (which I spent half of the time idling around and wait for my production to finish). It was more a fight against the game mechanics than actually reaching any goals.At least I had no game breaking bugs, just annoying little problems. 

Still: I see potential for being a very fun game. My suggestions for this to become reality:
- a toolbelt for about 3-4 tools
- a pouch for currencies (with no need to take out the coins, buying automatically takes them from there)
- broaden streets, make truck smaller or let it ignore collision an some world objects, to not getting it stuck an every lamp post
- farming quests reward more coins or farming equipment (especially irrigation hook) gets cheaper
- drop items on cursor position
- items can be bought and moved in user-specified sized stacks
- collision-free storage for building parts (my dig sites quickly looked like scrapyards)
- improve quest system ( e.g. show position of quest giver, maybe make it possible to link a quest roll to an item, so I can see on mouseover who wants this item and where should I deliver it
- create a reason to build T3 except for it having better yield
- map should be available at all time without holding it
- replace RNG based lobster quest
- remove steam truck from start equipment. it takes the fun of thriving for it to improve your mobility.",1684624884,1684624884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros,

Cute graphics which are easy on the eye.
Great voice acting which is very relatable being that I am from Frome in Somerset.
A physics engine which is luckily more fun than frustrating.
Easy to learn controls.
Sound design and options are extensive which allow removal of repetitive sound bytes.
Well done achievements which allow coverage of all branches of the content in the game.
Many fun little secrets to discover which can make the grind in this game have some laughs along the way.
A well designed learning curve which allows for several systems which can suit any player.
A positive vibe when it comes to trial and error which is refreshing.
On that note there is an underwritten feeling that you can fail and still learn or have fun.
Some great artistic buildings in the game with more being added frequently.
An extensive and fair amount of items to allow for individuality and creative designs.
A clear yet not forced path for progression.
A great modding community which can adapt the game and remove some frustrations.
An awesome developer who truly loves and cares about this game.

BUT the game is not without some downsides.

Cons,

No actual co-op, this is a massive tragedy and it is such a shame considering how well set up the game is for such a thing.
The dialogue can get repetitive.
There is no major money sink when you start getting into 6 and 7 figures.
Placement in the game can be a little jagged and frustrating sometimes.
Farming and fishing although fun in their own right, just cannot live up in comparison to mining, meaning it is one way or the highway.
I wish more mods were implemented into the game on a more permanent and non achievement removing basis.
There are still some underlying issues hanging around from early access which is understandable due to the limited dev team.
Buying a large amount of items is extremely frustrating and it is a shame you cannot buy things in sets of 5 or 10 or so on.


This is really difficult, I have one major friend that I play games with and recently he has been rather busy which is what made me pick this game up. We tried playing this in the weird Steam co-op mode but it was unplayable in reality, I think the audience for this game would be far higher if it was REAL co-op, I think this is the games biggest downside.

All of the other faults could be overlooked if you were giggling them away with a friend or three.

Even though I 100%'d this game I will keep it installed and come on back to it with major updates.

I just hope it progresses in the same direction that full release is bringing it in.

In short, if you want to play with friends then don't buy it just yet, if you want 100 hours of brain zenning then it is worth every single penny and more, even just to run everyone over and get them stuck in fun places.

There are a number of challenges besides just building an efficient factory, such as optimizing your trips to and from stores, optimizing transporting items (you can only hold 1 object in your hand at a time, but there are vehicles and containers that can hold many.), optimizing excavation of a new dig site, precision driving and aiming can help speed certain processes along (especially washing dirt at the beginning.)

Somethings to note:
Multiplayer is RemotePlay only! Remote play is where Steam streams your display to a friend and you virtually play Splitscreen. I didn't buy the game for multiplayer and haven't tried it, but just be aware of that situation.

I'm only at 20 hours of gameplay right now but it doesn't seem that the progression is very long yet. Hopefully the developer(s?) keep adding tiers (currently only 3) and more goals to reach. Even if they're ludicrous, games like this are always funner with some kind of goal to strive for.

The lack of an inventory means it's very slow, annoying, and painful to build your automation setups. It's not rewarding to play the game efficiently because of this. It's easier to make a basic setup and leave the game running on its own in the background like an idle game until your machines break or you run out of filter fuel, or you just get a mod to not need filtered water.

It is kind of a slow grind in the beginning, or at least it was for me. If you don't have the patience for that, then this game isn't for you. I've played other crafting games that have a slow start (mostly of the survival variety) but this one feels particularly slow and grindy for a while. Admittedly, I got a little bored and frustrated with the progress a few times, made worse by the fact that you can only carry ONE thing at time, and your freaking currency is one of the things you must carry to and from places. And there's multiple currencies. That's my biggest gripe, honestly. But once I got passed all of that and got my first mining operation up and running, it was smooth sailing. The game got so much easier and enjoyable at that point because you can afford things that make your life easier and your operations more efficient. Even carrying multiple items at a time became easier. 

My absolute favorite aspect of the game is the logic cables and machines. There's a lot of really cool things you can do with them to automate your repair, smelting, and compressing processes that I had a fun time trying to figure out. Personally, I found that building a system that worked just the way I wanted it to was more rewarding than the money I was making off my mine. That's the game's biggest strength, in my opinion. Its biggest weakness--despite the fact that being able to hold only one thing at a freaking time was super annoying in the beginning--I would have to say is the game's builder. It's meh. It's not terribly flexible. Everything must snap to a grid at right angles to any of the axis and the way specific build pieces snap to this grid makes the placement of other pieces look a bit weird. Example: walls and wall decorations. If you snap your walls to the interior of the floor gridbox, your wall decorations like sconces will partially clip through, hiding the base of the sconce. This is also true of furniture like beds and tables placed up against the wall; the edges will clip into the wall. Snap the wall to the exterior and you now have a weird lip over your foundation (which can be hidden with other walls or floors or what have you) but also at the top where the roof connects to the wall. Dives. Me. Batty. It's frustrating.

ADHD side note: I found this game to be particularly jarring to my ADHD. First because it was boring and grindy which nearly made we lose interest entirely the day I bought it, and then because the logic system was so engaging and interesting that I hyperfixated on it for days. Just a heads up for fellow ADHDers. This game can be exhausting.",1684190879,1684190879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Buy on sale or in a few years when it's more complete.

The only thing left to do after that is grind money/points for higher tier machines that are just more efficient/effective versions of the earlier ones with no new functionality or variety.

It's more like a Darksouls kind of game... you know... that kind of game that only people play that want to suffer. 

So i will give you the positive(+) things in this game, and the negative(-).

- The Building mechanic in this game is the worst in every single game i have ever seen. 
The controls mainly function with Mouse1 and E. if you press E in the wrong moment prepare to fix your machine for the next 20min because E picks things up without any animation or cooldown or anything. 

Especially awful since E is ""use"" in about every other game on the planet. Here, ""use"" is Mouse1. 


- For a physic simulating game, the physics are nothing more than a joke. 
Things flying all over the map when you look at them wrong happened more often then I cared to count. 


- Your only real ""Goal"" is Money. But Money is useless. After about 10hrs you will have about 100k easy and from there you no longer need any more money. After 17hrs, I am a multimillionaire and don't know what to-do with it. It would take me longer to spend the money then to earn it back. 

- If you need a specific item, good luck finding the right shop for it. Since some items are only sold at some places. This is extremely terrible in your early 5-8hrs of the game. 

- The Icehelm? Or what ever it is called, the place where you craft your Miners and some other things is a literal hell to navigate. You need to drive to it for 2min. Go inside, which takes about 3min, and then go back out for another 3min. The elevator does not even have a button and travels randomly up and down randomly. So be prepared to miss it and wait for another 20sec until it comes back down. 
That's at least 5-7min every single time you need to craft something. And you need to craft something more often than you like. Since that's the only place for the miners and grinders. 

- Optimization is something the devs properly never heard of. If you have a bucket or other container with too many items, your frames are now no longer existent. It drops from 100+ to 5fps whenever you hold the container. This counts for Vehicles too, not only your hands. 

- The sound design is made specifically to torment your ears. I ended up muting the game entirely after about 3hrs. 

- there is no Inventory. You can only hold 1 Item at a time. (why????????????)
Not even your Money is in the Interface... no. Money/coins is an Item that you need to take with you.
Just imagine this with any other game... like? Minecraft, for a lack of a better example.... Imagine you need to drop your Pickaxe to take a single piece of cobblestone with you every time you mine one. 

That's kind of what it feels like, anyway. 

- The Bugs. There are many. Like Cyberpunk2077 on release kind of many. 
Things just flying everywhere, things dropping straight into the ground never to be seen again. 
and don't dare to drive too fast over that rock if you don't want to end up on the moon. 

And so much more.....
Like there is no endgame, no goal, not even a reason to advance your machine... just make an easy automatic machine and go AFK until something breaks. (or just go into creative... why take a game serious when not even the devs do.) 

After I had my things' setup I played it more like an Idle game than a mining game, sit and wait, and every 10min repair everything. Repeat. And you don't even want to make a cool new machine or setup on a new plot because the building system is so trash. There is literally no enjoyment in this. Even though, the premise of the game is good. 

Oh... and have I mentioned that you don't drop things by looking where you want to drop them? Oh no, there is a small circle next to you.... that's where things drop. (Except the shovel, you need to jump to drop it 99% of the time)

This had to be made with the intent to be as unintuitive as possible. No sane person could think of a system like that. 

Well. Now to the good things. 

+ The Graphics and Models look kinda good most of the time. Not RDR2 level, but still better than most games of this kind. That doesn't explain the terrible performance though.

Okay, that outta the way, I feel like the direction this game went isn't really compatible with what it built itself on. Sure, probably way back when you'd still need to do most everything manually the process of (mostly) moving things one by one and making yourself a nice, square house next to your hole would have been deeply satisfying. But as it is currently, I believe the idea is to incentivize us as players to build, and all that jazz, but building is kinda tedious. There's a point while playing where I just switched from risking losing sleep over this game for how engaged I was to just hopping on to tinker for a bit before moving on with my day and that's not of my own free will. I just can't get as invested currently, because outside of finding the things in each dig site there's nothing to do, and I have enough money to just throw tnt at the problem until it goes away. Anything I would do would be for its own sake, but that's not what I want to play it for. I want to have a drive, to have the next thing. 

So yeah, economy REALLY needs a rebalancing because once you automate production it's kinda fucked. I'll still recommend this game, because the 50 hours of figuring it out and the work to get to where I am was fun, and I'm certain once the dev ""discovers"" (this choice of word will never not be funny to me in this context) a physics engine that allows proper co-op it will be a thoroughly enjoyable deal, Kudos on the multi-monitor splitscreen though.

There are a few thing that I'd like to see improve like the reliability of the logic system and more interesting gameplay mechanics/loops.

The farming update that just came out did a great job adding more gameplay that fit in very well with other gameplay but was different enough to make it super fun/interesting.

If you find a bug, you can report it directly to the devs on discord and its normally fixed very quickly. 
Honestly I recommend getting the game now because I think it will end up being worth far more than the current £12 price with the trajectory of improvements being made.
And by supporting small indie studios like this (3 people I think?) you're actively improving the gaming space by giving indies the ability to produce top quality projects, which puts pressure on larger developers to focus on quality as well.

It still is on the fence for me but it's leaned over to positive, they do seem to be making QoL changes still.

**Original Review**
This game is definitely a Meh, it rides on the fence but I lean towards negative because of their updates. I do appreciate that they are releasing new content, at a pretty decent rate. The problem is seeing them releasing new content makes me realize that the annoying things baked into the foundation of the game are there forever.

There is no inventory, you can't even put money in your pocket, you have to carry it around like every other item. There are ways to carry more things like carts and vehicles, but having to physically take your money from the cart and put it in the appropriate bin is annoying. It probably wouldn't be as annoying if money stacked well, but trying to get two different stacks to combine is an act of frustration in itself. Admittedly it is kind of charming at first, but it gets old extremely fast.

There's also a mass amount of jank that probably won't ever be addressed considering they're focused on bringing in new things. Throwing explosives is insanely random, my characters seem to throw it behind himself more often than not, destroying some of my production line. I'm constantly using the Unstuck command because trying to dig in any sort of reasonable pattern is impossible.

There are NPCs now but they are so soulless and bot like I would rather they had none like before. They changed the gameplay loop to now you have to do the sorriest quests from NPCs to get a different currency for higher tier equipment. On the plus side, hitting NPCs with a vehicle is the funnest part of this game, it's also the most rewarding, which probably isn't good.

Any reward I feel from increasing my gains is easily wiped out by realizing the next step is going to be so aggravating just to control everything through, it's not worth it. It's also worth mentioning how much trial and error is required because there is literally no in game explanation. There is a tutorial that gives you the basics, but you hit wall after wall of unexplained problems. It all reads as very amateur.

TLDR; The machinery in game all seems to function well and is rewarding, but the gameplay mechanics are so bad, it makes setting up any machinery a miserable experience.",1681958385,1683245296,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Liked the atmosphere, and the chill vibe. Some interesting automation and logic options.
The game has a lot of potential

Don't let the list below think I did not like the game.
All the other reviews focus on what you can do, but I focus on things that I found lacking:

[spoiler]
Cons:
- There does not seem to be a goal or reason to continue after you have tried out every device,( or I did not reach that stage yet?)
- Core game play seems to be repeating:setup automation for T1 to get T2 mats to get T3 mats.
- Building is... strange, you either snap, or you go certain distance away to place it where you want in 3D. This needs more fine adjustment options
- Bulk buy. you got to move every single item, think 20 blocks,200 pipes etc. 
- You get money real quick and there is nothing to spend it on besides devices/construction.
- I know this is mining game but more decorations/building pieces would be nice.
- Vehicle handling is wonky AF :D 
- The starter vehicle and T2 vehicle ( truck/tractor) trunk is too small, barely fits some of the construction pieces.
- T1 and T2 does not seem to have any differences besides the paint job, but then again it costs peanuts, after 1h you can buy almost every vehicle.
- Some performance issues when there is bunch of chunks in the bucket, or when you put too much items in the trunk cus you decided to build a house and don't want to drive 10x back and forth.
- The magnet tool is very rubbery, and you need to do 120 FOV to see anything it moves.
- There are no tool tips when you aim at stuff, only when you pick it up, which is bad because everything needs to be sourced and brought to your place of construction in cart/truck and if you have too much stuff there: good luck picking the part you want... oh took a wrong part, well just litter it around everywhere.
- When you pick up conveyor belt it picks up pipe too, which is weird and disrupts everything.
- Stuff can only overlap in the truck trunk/cart, so you end up using carts for storage of excess parts and you can only buy 1 roof at a time since those don't overlap on buy counter either( you can buy more if you jump or cheeze more on top each other)
- Left and right conveyor spliter is is swapped? goes right but says left...
- Then there is occasional crashes that lock the desktop and only way was to restart.
- Stairs are 1 block, but walls, doors, roof is 2 squares... so no aligning possible :(
- The sky is very strong in contrast to ground especially in sunset/sunrise, to the point you can not see ground without additional light source (because the dirt is just pitch black at that time). The sky also seems to be a dome, that said its the same in west and east during sunset/sunrise.

1. It is like Satisfactory? Probably, but in small measure. You don't build extra base. don't need a lot of machines for more and more product. So it is more simplify. 
2. Time you spend? It have good value for money. And much better in sale. But I should by ask for more product probably, what can we craft in game.
3. Bugs? Like i was wrote there are some still. But after 2 months big improvement.  (sometime some staff fly, for 33 playtime it is happen to me just 2 time, 

If developer still push updates it is good game. If not, anyway in sale it have good value. IM in more like 35 hours and spend there min. double, probably triple more time,",1682863123,1683224531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, optimization, control precision, and design choices seem pretty bad. And the lack of content. Unless your a masochist, beyond elden ring masochism, I wont recommend this game.

TLDR 
Pro, Its a fun game when working, has nice graphics and flavor. Has some interesting options. 
CON'S shoddy aiming even though your expected to be precise and even when you are precise it may all go horribly wrong, No inventory and can only carry one thing at a time. Impossible to optimize unless they change one of the mechanics of the game, and they won't. Lack of ACTUAL content. If your going to have a mining and crafting game, then you need more then 14 recipes with only 3 usable by you at any 1 time and more then 4 metals, gems, and power crystals to mine. Which you can get all of the resources with your pan shovel and scrub brush. Mining really has only 1 goal. Get a auto mine and smelting setup and then its done. 5 miners, 1 crusher, 5 smelters and some gem sorting. Water pipes, pressure increase and conveyor belts is all you need to get stupid rich and able to make anything. Which most of the time you don't need.
END TLDR

First, optimization. There is none. The game specializes in having tons of tiny chunks of resources laying about. And it can't handle it. They could have made it so that multiple chunks of the same type merge when placed together like the money does. This single action would fix the biggest cause of lag. I left a couple drills running for about 5 minutes. When I got back, the pan had a good amount of resources all ready to go. Until I picked up the pan and got a slide show of 1 frame per 5 seconds. Quality. Later game you can mostly deal with this by using sorters compressors and auto smelters. Can just conveyor belt it all around with no problems, but since the whole point is to start pan mining and to work your way up, that's not a possibility for quite a while. And you will be handling thousands of chunks well before you can stream line it. They did do something with chunks attached to surfaces like pans though. Well, until you pick up the pan. Speaking of the pan, you will mess up at some point and spray hundreds of chunks all over the ground making a huge mess. Which leads to my next point.

Number 2. Precision controls. There are none. Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to have a prosthetic arm thats fully extended at all times forward and to the right and the only way to release the items is from 4 feet up at that exact angle despite where your looking or whether you look up or down? Ever wonder what it would be like to try and place things  carefully with no actual aiming mechanic? Well, you will find out soon. Not to mention, all you get is a small shadow to show where it 'should' go. If your looking at your feet you might see it. Sometimes. Just not what you need precision for. Like pouring a pan of ore into a smelter because you can't see the shadow in the pot. Oh well, 300 gold nuggets spray all over the place as you slightly misjudge and it hits the rim and flies everywhere around you. No big deal. Pick each piece up and try to do the same thing again, with every single piece. 1 AT A TIME. WTF. I suppose there is a 'easier' way. There is a magnet on a stick. Of course, any sudden movements, moving forward, turning, jumping, all of that can cause disaster with your telekinetic floating blob of hate inducing disaster in the making.

Number 3 Design decisions. So the god awful aiming mechanics, the fact that no matter how big or small something is, you can only carry one at a time. Walking simulator whenever you go shopping. Sometimes you can ferry stuff around with a vehicles. Not always. This deep underground forge/store/mining location does not have room for vehicles. The shop is 5 floors... ish from the place you can mine. Even with virtually unlimited money it takes FOREVER to ferry everything from the shop to your work station. To automate 1 miner to a smelter (which would leave you a ton of resources just sitting somewhere, takes well over a hour of walking back and forth. And thats with me walking out the shop, throwing it all over a cliff edge towards my mine. And then jumping over the edge myself so i can start running them all to the next room with my mine and setting everything up. You will do so much pacing back and forth that you will become tired and turn the game off even though you have not physically done any of the walking. Your a blacksmith and miner... and farmer. You create up to 5 items that you can't use. Dagger, axe, sword, ring, and necklace. Those are for missions or money. For yourself, you can make 9 things. Only and they are really only 3 with 3 tiers. Miner, Crusher, and a water pressure increase item. Even though pipes and other items are made out of the different resources, you can't make them. And since you can have unlimited money quick with just the tier 1 items I don't even see the point. Even the late game stuff is just weird ways of doing old things. Often more complicated and less useful in my opinion. Then we have farming and cooking. I have not done much with farming and cooking. Realized it was more busy work and lost interest for now. Dig hole, Plant seed, drop pan in water cause you can't scoop it up. chase it down and go pour the WHOLE PAN OF WATER on 1 plant. Repeat for every plant you want to water. Woo. There may be better tools but they are locked behind special currency that you can only get from farming hundreds of tomatoes because everyone wants a small bowl of tomato soup. Small bowl = small reward. Which means not enough currency to buy stuff unless you grind. 

There is so many design decisions that blemish this game, yet, if they were removed, the game would become start to end maybe a hour if they fixed it. So they left it. Instead of content, the game was built around tedious poor control mechanics. I mean, every NPC says basically 2 lines. 'Ey up lad', and 'I need a bit of scram'. There is a few other phrases but thats the jist of it. There is no survival or fighting mechanics. So it lives on its mining and self made experiences and construction.

Oh... Construction. Every survival game or even other primarily crafting games get construction better. You can't pull items in or push them away when trying to place them. You can't push a button to snap to points, like pipes snapping to the end of other pipes. You cant even choose to raise or lower items. And everything is picked up with the same button. You pick up and drop items with E. Thats for resources dropped on the ground, or if you miss, the floor under them. Until you buy a construction hammer, a tiny misclick can cause massive problems. Remember, you cant raise, lower, recess, pull in or push out the placement of a item. You have to move. Carefully place a block, place other things around it, accidentally click it, and you may never get it back in place.


All that said, I enjoy the game when its not making me go bald. I like calm simple games sometimes. This has a beautiful world, graphics and some great animations and play options. And I know there is more for me to see and do. But, its impossible to look past the MANY flaws. I will continue to play. I have gotten better at the shoddy controls, but every time there is a unexpected resource explosion I like the game a little bit less. I don't recommend the game, because I don't want people to suffer such bad mechanics. Unless your a masochist. Honestly. I get more upset when resources go flying then I do in elden ring after my 20th death to the same boss.",1683136803,1683136803,False,1,0,0,3,True,False,False

update 2:  now the excavator is gone and if you want to dig down to the good ore, grab pickaxe.  hope you have a few extra hours to spend.  oh, theres throwable tnt for 45c. which removes about as much dirt as 5 or 6 swings of the pickaxe. call me when the excavator is back.

REPEAT NUISANCE ENCUMBERMENT AND MESS GENERATOR.
No inventory or tool bar. Uhh?!!! YES! They left you an easily assumed naked one 
arm, one hand mongo who's only word is ""Uhh?"" and nickname is ""lad"" to work with.
He gets stuck on almost every object he interacts with. His AI is non existEnt but 
to make up for it he can pull tons load carts and lift pallets of items that would 
break an industrial forklift but can only carry/interact with one object at a time. 
Supernaturally strong but incredibly dumb. 

TOTAL FAIL.
While you can mine iron, smelt it and craft a very small amount of items, you cannot craft 
tools, pipes, machines etc which I find extra dumb on top of the already dumb options.

TOTAL FAIL.
It's just nuts how many different ways the devs of this game disregards how many other games there are 
that feature mining, machines, conveyor belts, vehicles. Hydroneer is the shameless mong of them all.
The game is utterly broken with the following current persistEnt facts. I literally have no idea 
how it made it past beta/early access stage. Just barge on with the ship the T-Shirts etc with 
the instant NOPE! buggy, messy junk. Terrible game, terrible devs. Total trollface or total fail 
I'm not sure which one, might be both. This game makes a hideous mess of it all on purpose.

EXTREME LAGGY/BROKEN/GLITCHY MINED OBJECTS. THESE ARE NOT RECOGNISED AS BUGS 
BUT PERSISTENTLY MAINTAINED THROUGH THE PATCHES, MANY. 

TOTAL FAIL.
Items (ores, gems, dirt) can merge or pass through each other but at times only randomly it seems.
Only sometimes they are trying to enforce the realism of no-clip collisions and surface interactions.
Items get stuck in sorters then following items start to pile up on stuck item.
Items get stuck on thin air at the end of conveyor belts instead of drop into sorter/pan etc.
Items you are forced to work with? Ores, dirt, gems, shards, tools, machines, conveyor belts, 
pipes, vehicles... they hate you. The devs of this game got carried away with the trollface of 
make the game make a huge mess with glitches bugs and disfunction and leave you to ""try"" and 
tidy it all up. Eventually with just T1 miners I made highly unstable mining array that paid 
about 75K every 10 minutes in gold/iron/gems. What is that... 10x the gold I need with just T1? I
had 12 t1 mining machines in 1 side of ember cradle. I used the handy but dumb t2 pump/boosters bug(?) 
to keep the entire t1 pipes rig at 175 pressure. 

TOTAL FAIL.
Items roll around a bit too much to say the least. They also turn on/off sticky item effect in often annoying 
times such as piles of ores get stuck on thin air thus blocking your crucible and half what you poured in.
How much code time is each item spending thinking about the ground, it's shape, momentum, pitch and gravity?
How often in terms of miliseconds is each item checking for collisions?
How often is a pan of ores updating it's current wieght and value check? On or off scales?
How come 2 x 150 ore pans in hand/on a vehicle dont lag but 1 x 300 ores in a pan lags to hell?
Are items losing the plot too quick to save CPU? Why are some items acting very differently than others 
or just jamming on air, a surface of a machine, on a conveyor stuck then others get stuck on that item.
Mindless lazy dodgers, incompetence, penny pinching or hideously troll faced devs, not sure which? 
Take your pick, might be all of them. The game does not work because it makes a hideous mess with the 
disfunctional glitchy, jamming, sticky, merge then not merge, gravity ect ignoring mined items.

TOTAL FAIL.
Take your dumb magnet on a stick and replace it with an uninstall click. Problem solved.
(It only adds to mess problems causing huge ore explosions and tags all items with 
hardly helpful ""never merge"" status.)
A pan with any large amount of ores in it will be nice compact tidy and the items in it will merge no problem.
It will lag to hell your FPS if the items in pan are over 170(in my instance) when you try to carry or move it. 
With 100s of ores in a pan it all sits tidy, flat, compact. Good! 
If you pick up an ore and drop it back in the pan it sits nice again.
However,... if something happens, like you go to pour the pan into a smelter but it already had ores in it 
and instead of you pouring the pan into the smelter it tips the smelter to make an ingot and then pours the 
100s ores from the pan everywhere. Or you go to pour a mixed ores pan into a manual sorter but had not noticed 
just moments before that 1 of your water purifiers had broken and the water was off, you pour the 100s in and 
... mess. Once you use a magnet on a stick to try pull ores they will no longer merge or sit flat with others 
and always repel collisions. They form a huge ball that's useless. They often drag in other stuff to 
the mess just trying to move said mess around in a compact mining operation with dumb magnet on a stick.

TOTAL FAIL.
No inventory. No backpack, nothing. You WHAT M8!?! This is bizarrely off the normal beaten approved industry/mining game track? 
Guess this dev studio just did not have the time or skill to code an inventory or utility/skillbar ect. 
It is worth mentioning that without toolbar or inventory you will be fiddling around and running about a 
HUGE amount with the expected using ""the nearby ground"" as your storage/work space. Items no-clip through objects and roll around or away too often with said barely ever flat ground.
I fell through the dirt layers in ember cradle a few times onto the bedrock below. No-Clip fail.

GOLD MEDAL FAIL.
The above annoying mechanics completely destroy the game's playability IMO. As part of the above mentioned no inventory thing? You can only carry/use one object at a time...(!!!) Currency is an object. Constantly picking up, moving and dropping items because only carry one item at a time, pick up and drop bucket 15 times because it keeps rolling over and other facepalm generating nuisances as you try to complete objective. Irritating gameplay involving chunky awkward world mechanics, tools and objects with glitchy surface interactions between objects and clumsy object interactions.
Creative mode is the exact same as normal mode only you don't have to pay for items from the shops.
The tutorial is unrealistic, over in minutes but shows the extreme simplicity of the game.
To make the entire game last more than 3 hours they throw a huge amount of hardly enjoyable mess and awkward mechanics in the way.

Hydroneer? IMO It's billions of light years behind Satisfactory/Factorio/Dyson Sphere/NMS/Planet Nomads/Craftopia/Minecraft 
ETC, ETC building and mining games. Played those games for many 1000s hours. This game is utter disfunctional junk. 
Enjoy this awkward, weirdly oblivious game if you get it. 
IMO this one is far too messy and unstable to actually provide the intended 
game play without masses of mess and nuisance in the way.

PS I'm a boss at all Industry behemoth games. This game is far too messy.

You come out with farming and quests but when will you actually listen to your community, not a bunch of Youtubers LMAO Sad company, Sad game, I wish it had gone differently.

Edit: The game has a decent story and is an alright single player game but it can't go without being said it can be a rather quiet and lonely game at times. One of my favorite core features in most survival/mining games is the multiplayer aspect where the team get to work together to accomplish amazing goals. Hydroneer has been lacking in the multiplayer since day one and i can't say i wasn't excited when you released ""multiplayer"". I've been a subscriber on your Youtube channel since like 2020 and have been following the games releases since but i have just been able to tell the lack of care for the current stage in the game. You would really rather add more stuff in the game to do opposed to just taking a few months and getting multiplayer running. I promise you that the day Hydroneer has actual multiplayer it will atleast get a 25% increase in player count if not more. I believed in the game at launch but ever since then my hope for the game has slowly diminished, I truly hope you don't take this to heart Max, as i do respect the game you have created i just think it deserves more love than you are giving it.

The integration of the Steam workshop is a great feature, and the mods created by some talented developers are definitely worth trying out.

I strongly recommend this game due to the exceptional value it offers at its price point, surpassing the quality that is typically expected. Furthermore, the developers have been diligent in adding new features to the game. While there are some aspects where the game feels incomplete, it is best observed through gameplay rather than described. Fortunately, there are excellent creators who have made videos about the game that can help form your opinion.

Although the game could use some improvements, such as adding multiplayer instead of just remote play split-screen, as well as further customization and progression, it is still a fantastic game as it is.",1682824556,1682824679,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once you get over the novelty of the interface you have kind of done and seen everything the game has to offer.  Yes, you *could* then proceed to build some large scale mining or farming operation or whatever but I don't see why you would.  That's kind of the issue here: there doesn't seem to be a reason to *do* anything.  I guess that isn't, in itself, a problem but check the store page: craft weapons?  It feels very deceptive.  It's true, but only in that its a list of ""things that are in the game.""  There are weapons and jewelry in the game, but there isn't say, equipment or combat.  Yes there is farming and cooking fixtures, but again, there isn't anything *else*.  Food, like weapons, is just a thing you can sell.  You might be tempted to think these features lead somewhere, but they do not.

It honestly plays a lot like a first gen VR game where the novelty of using your actual hands is supposed to make you ignore that the game isn't going anywhere.  I think this has some merits, contrary to complaints, as the unique control scheme is kind of what the game has going for it.  Remove that and you have any number of other games on Steam.  Even so, I had to double check Hydroneer wasn't actually in early access because it definitely *feels* unfinished.  For example, there's a little indicator that shows where something will drop but it's like... what everyone will want is to point where they'd like to put something down.  That this game has been out for two years and the best it can offer is an alternative precision mode that doesn't work ... well, I gave it seven hours but I would kind of like that time back.

1: A inventory system.

DEAR GODS you can't even pocket your money?  That is unbelievable and immersion breaking somehow?  Okay so you dont want someone carrying an anvil around in the same slot that a much smaller item would go into on a toolbar, how do we deal with this?
.
..
...
TADA: In Game Backpacks and classifying each object already in game with a size and mass category.  The backpack would only be able to hold so much mass and within that mass, it also would have a size limit.  BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!  Different kinds of backpacks.  Farmers Pack which is meant to hold onto a TON of seeds, harvested crops and the like and possibly even upgradable via quests!  A Market Pack whose entire purpose is to bring raw materials or processed materials to the market.  Lots of Small space to fill up.  Then of course the Hauler Pack which would allow a person to carrying one additional Large item.

""But wait!"" I hear someone cry out ""Thats alot of material to go back and add an extra couple of tags to, the author is clearly working on upgrading the game as it is, get off their back!""  Its really not, but for those of you who don't understand how easy it is to mass add tags to groups of in-game objects, we could go with something else that would add some QoL.

A Purchase Mule at the front of each Plot.  This mule can be an actual donkey, a person or just a cart, but the entire point would be that it has a catelogue of all the things being sold in the game that you have access too, and for a small fee and a tiny bit of time-cooldown, this Mule could let you buy and then deliver objects to the plot you are working on.  This isn't game breaking and could easily be tweaked about, with its own Guild whose quests can be done to upgrade the speed and decrease the delivery cost.

AT THE VERY LEAST THOUGH
If nothing else gets added, if NOTHING else gets added.
PLEASE add a money pouch.  Having to run around with our arms stuck out infront of us holding our money infront of us like some kind  of subway goblin with a pile of Shiny Things they found.  The character wears clothing, it has pockets.  One can be sewn on if need be, its not that hard.  IRL I have crap sewing skills and I could easily make a shit-job-pouch to hold a few coins at least.

*Sigh* and no, stacking a bunch of shit up in a bucket so that it literally stacks and goes static doesn't count as a inventory system.  It counts as a unintended side-effect glitch.  You are not Bethesda,  This isn't a 'quality feature', its a bug.



Now, past the complaining.  The game itself is neat and does everything it sets out to do: Panning for gold, smelt stuff, sell it, use a lego-system to create structures.  Improvements and additional content are constantly being added so its likely this game could mutate far beyond what it currently is.  Perhaps they already have a inventory system in the works but are holding off until other things get updated instead of having to create a system then recreate it for a planned upgrade.  Even if nothing else gets added, its a decent adhd burner though the need to drag objects huge distances can really destroy the appeal for those who like zone into building structures and machines.

""But creative mode!"" Do we really need to cheat for some basic QoL functions? Once you start with creative mode the entire purpose of the game for most would be over.  Thats not a suitable solution.

2. A combat mode?  Random creatures and monsters that will wander in from the Surrounding Wilds.  Could include water-machinery turrets that could fire anything loaded into it, from ore chunks to processed materials and even fully made weapons, belt fed of course with a possibility of the 'ammo' being recoverable.  The creatures would of course drop things upon defeat.  They could just be elementals so they drop ore when defeated and their main goal is to get to the biggest hole on the map, jump in and fill it with a self-destruct dirtbomb, which would let starting gear like the shovel be a semi-effective weapon, against dirt golems at least.  it would provide a reason to make weapons and armor, outside of selling it.",1682764872,1682764872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Things that would be cool to see in the future hopefully would be stuff like a radio that you can buy from a shop or a radio in a store with multiple songs and a function to switch threw them.
 
More side-quests like the fishing rod side-quest.

A wood source such as chopping down plant-able trees with a saw.
 
More structures such as trap doors and more pillars.

Boats you can with mats you can grind for or to be able to buy the boats.

A bigger map and small islands would be cool so then we can build bridges to them and get resources from.

Move-able back on a truck to get the stuff off quicker.

I rate it 7/10 - too addictive and too simple, but it's a fun gold-digging waterpunk game.

In a nutshell:
What this game has  but other games don't – you physically transport currencies, resources and 3-dimensional machines with your flatbed truck from a shop to your quarry. THERE IS NO INVENTORY.
What other games have but this game doesn't: you actually build factories. Here you just build a sorting station and keep adding more drills, pipes and conveyors.

In a game like Satisfactory, expansion requires you to increase raw material production, expanding low-tier refining, mid-tier refining and even high-tier refining, as well as transportation (conveyor belts/pipes/trains/trucks etc) and energy production, and on top of that constructing buildings, but you build with a magical gun.
In this game, expansion requires you to (I'm serious) add miners and water pipes, and connect them to your sorting system with conveyor belts. Energy is free and only requires one pump.

That's the game past the point where you have a sorting system. You can also farm (and you have to in order to finish the quest line).",1681946629,1682594110,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The chunks of ore can lag the game badly. If you have an automated mine they get stuck in the small sorters. then they block the rest from going in and you wind up with hundreds of rocks in a small pile. If you use the maget to dislodge them they literally explode away as each one fights for its own space to exist. Otherwise you have to delete all of them in the menu unless you want to pick them up individually.

The building framework is also cumbersome to deal with. You have to pick up each item (pipe, tool, wall, floor) and put them in the checkout area. After purchase you must pickup them up again and put them in the truck where they can overlap. Moving with 100's of pipes, building pieces, and machines gets laggy. You will need more than a thousand for an automated digsite with buildings. Why not have the parts transferred to the truck like in the dwarven smithy? It means you have to handle every pieces 3-4 times at minimum. I want a way to say ""I want 50 of stright pipes in my truck"" click, 25 elbows, click, 100 floor sections, click. Also make them bundled so the hundred object in the truck dont ALL have to render while driving.

I enjoy playing and building and get frustrated with the tediousness. 4 out of 5

The copy paste messages about the multiplayer is seriously depressing to see. You're telling me you can't even come up with messages that have some degree of emotion in them? Just 'ctrl-c ctrl-v'?

That being said, the excuse for multiplayer is the physics, as if this game is revolutionary in the way the physics function. I'm sorry but saying the game made in Unreal Engine can't have proper co-op because physics is essentially just saying 'Too hard to work around sorry'. As someone else said, solo devs have done better in the same engine with less time for a cheaper price. It's not an engine limitation it's quite literally a skill issue.

I've had fun with it but it feels a little shallow for a 2.0 release. There is only 1 production chain so do yourself a favor and figure out as much as you can by yourself, only get help if you are stuck. Because that 1 production chain is pretty much the entire game.

I see little reason to make mines all over the map, there is no benefit to it. It's faster and easier to make money by making an easily expandable layout and just keep adding on to it. When you figure out how to do it you have beaten the game.

Sure you can play around making cute little houses or try to figure out the terrible logic parts only to create a monstrosity and realize there is almost no benefit to it besides repairing. In the grand scheme of the game everything is priced super cheap so once you have the (semi) automation setup and figure out the mining mechanics there is no more challenge and nothing to work toward. Tier 2 mining and any future tiers will not change that much as the end game is still the same, non-existent.

It's a fine sandbox, if you are into that you will love this game, for the price it's an absolute steal. If you want another Satisfactory keep looking.

I look forward to the planned updates and see promise for a deeper experience.

Farming Update:
The farming mechanic itself is an interesting addition but it feels out of place in a game that was previously just about mining. It can be fun but it's still pretty shallow. Some of the best parts you buy with tokens are useless because by the time you can afford them you want to be done with farming (sprinklers, harvesting vehicle). The NPC's do bring some life to the previously dead world but only a tiny bit. The soup making quests are not fun at all, pure grind.

Tier 3, Prospecting, and Achievements Update:
I started a new game for this to get the full experience. In the end prospecting is completely useless. Ore veins are not useful, just building more drilling machines is way more efficient. I was able to complete all achievements (except farming tokens because the quests are bugged) using only 6 tier 1 drills and 6 tier 2 drills. Letting them run while I did the farming stuff gave me way more than enough coins to buy anything I wanted. There was never a need to make a tier 3 mine.

The quests to get to the king are still just a grind of fetch quests and the reward is only useful if you are a sandbox player.

The updates make it sound like I hate the game but I don't. It's fun and quirky. It's still best for people who really like a sandbox though. Objective based gamers will find it lacking.

To me this feels like an early access game and as the developer is still adding content it's possible it will reach where I feel it is a released product.  The tutorial is okay but I'd prefer some pop up help on various things.  

The beginning game and mid game are almost different games and I almost wish they would find a faster way to get to midgame that didn't have you play another game.  You can pan for resources (tedious with okay rewards) or you can fish (less actions but also less money per item)  In the end you will spend an hour or two as a new player before you can start with midgame content.  This is not a new player friendly game.  

Once you have the game mostly figured out and understand how the majority of ths game works there is a very interesting design here.  This is not the massive factory systems you get in other games.  The 4 minable resources are just as avalible in the tedius early game as in the mid and late game.  You are not going to have to figure out complex mixing and processes to get to better content.  The various stages maily get you resources faster and with less manual processes.  

There is something interesting about not being able to interact with more than 1 thing at a time.  You don't materialize components out of thin air.  You have to go buy the parts, transport them where you want, and then install them one at a time.  This level of tedium is interesting and while it may not be for everyone I think a lot more people will like the automation building a lot more than the tedious panning for minerals or fishing.  

Once you get going you begin to see the limit of the current content.  I'd like to see a bit more to the game,m not just in resources or automation options but also in reasons to get the resources.  Once  you are making your components your only real thing to collect resoruces for is quests so you can get the tokens.  And while that does give you next tier stuff it doesn't really deepend the game play.  Id love to see a system to rebuild areas or install a delivery depot on your lands so you can have someone deliver stuff for you.  A new smelter at T3 or T4 that opened you up to alloys.  Farming and fishing are nice deversions but they don't really deepen the game  play for me.  

In the end for the minimal price this game asks for I really can't complain too much.  I do think the mid and late game mining automation are interesting and something new and fun.  Those two are why I recomend this.  It is my hope that either the developer will continue to deepen this game or consider making a Version 2 based on some of the core features of this one.  It's a good but not a great game.  But it has some really intriguing design choices that belong in a great game.",1682303483,1682303483,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like it, always been a fan of the factory automation games and this is no exception. 
I must however add that there are still a couple of glaring issues with the game mainly the way new material is purchased which you do by dropping EVERY, SINGLE, ITEM one at a time into the buying zone and then load everything into your truck or cart, this is an incredibly tedious process an i have no idea why the devs have not implemented some sort of bulk buy option yet, i can only hope they will add such a feature to the game more sooner then later.

Secondly i had very big issues with the performance, after my mentioned 50 hour run i ran into massive frame rate issues around my main base which progressively got worse the more time passed to the point where i had to restart the game once every hour or run around at 20 frames, im running a 3080 with a 12 core CPU and 32 gigs of ram so it most definitely ain't me, once again i can only hope the devs take the time to sit down and give that game a good thorough optimization, once both of those issues are addressed i will have no complaints left!

If you put too many (~50) items into a bucket, or onto the back of your car, the FPS will drop to ~2. After 50h of gameplay and capturing just one of ~6 available dig sites, the game became unplayable.

[hr][/hr]

The first impression, with no tutorial in the regular game, was rather bad. And then I was told the tutorial is available from the main menu - as a separate scenario where you lose everything you do.

Then I had 20-30 hours of fun, doing things by hand, then building up, automating, and so on.

The lack of any kind of interface is an interesting approach - there is no inventory or any kind of information displayed on the screen, all items are objects that have to be carried around; checking the weight of an iron bar requires putting it on a scale; and so on.

And then came the end game which is again rather poor:
[list]
[*] Big purchases become problematic, as you still have to move items one by one
[*] Very poor logic circuits:
[list]
[*] Logic circuits are non intuitive and have no tutorial whatsoever - e.g. sending signal 0 and not sending a signal at all are two different things.
[*] Despite ~30 different logic blocks, very little can be actually automated (no automation for fishing, picking plants, taking bars/gems from the smelters/compressors, crafting items on the anvil).
[*] Even the simplest circuits take a huge amount of space (and blocks to move).
[*] No modulo operator - have fun building a circuit of ~20 blocks for something that should be possible with just one. 
[/list]
[*] Conveyor belt sorters sometimes glitch and let the wrong items through.
[*] You and your vehicles often get stuck - and using the “unstuck” option often moves you or your vehicle to another stuck position.
[*] Clean up option that removes all loose piles of dirt from the map actually removes them from the sorters as well.
[*] There are two pointers - one for aiming and one for dropping held items, but there are inconsistencies which one is used by the item held - e.g. emptying the bucket will use the dropping pointer, but pouring a soup into a bowl will use the aiming pointer.
[*] Scale has a display on the wrong side - you have to put the item on its left side, but the display is on the right side. Putting the item using the dropping pointer, which is on the right side, therefore you cannot immediately see the weight of the item you just dropped.
[/list]

I am really torn whether to recommend it or not. I did have 30 hours of fun for £12.79, but on the other hand I was expecting more from it. I will be definitely looking forward to the updates.

The start was interesting, short amount of grind to purchasing my first things, meaningful improvements in my operation with almost every item bought. The gameplay also changes from all-manual to mostly automated gradually. Going around the map to find there are more items to find in a bigger town is also nice, I like it that there is motivation to pick where you want to build.

However, this is where the game ended for me. It looks like from here on all I need to do is wait, buy more drills, wait, dig 1 level lower, build the exact same setup with tier 2 and repeat. There are the relics to find, but it seems like a trivial side quest rather than actual content. There is farming and some new machines but ultimately I could basically leave the game running for a day on my tier 1 starter setup and end up with enough money to not make anything else relevant. I'm sure that people with more creativity than me will find arbitrary goals to set and get more out of the game, but for me it severely lacks depth.

Aside from the lack of content, the world feels dead with a few NPCs with very basic quests, nothing really moving aside from myself. The building feels rather clunky and aiming to drop things inside buckets and similar felt similarly annoying.. I understand each piece of dirt and rock has physics but it'd be nice to be able to throw them into a bucket 10cm away rather than just hold in your hand and let go wherever it falls.

I realise that the game never promised to have an objective being a sandbox, but for a sandbox it feels there is very little to do for the price. I got it on a discount, but I couldn't recommend it for more than £5 to be honest at the moment.",1682165253,1682165253,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Extremely open-ended play your way experience.
- Neat mechanics
- Wide variety of gameplay
- Very unique feel
- The jank.

Cons:
- The jank.
- The whole ""carry 1 item at a time"" thing. It's a neat concept, but turns every single goddamn thing into an exercise in patience, especially buying items from a shop that does not have vehicle access. Have fun running from buy pad to drop point 50 times.
- NO MULTIPLAYER. Come on, where's it at?! I've been following this game since launch, and it would be SO much better with up to 4 in some co-op.
- Illogical mechanics sometimes. Want to build your conveyor system this orientation? Sorry, the splitter conveyors only push one way even when spun about, so your entire contraption must be altered because of this.

Final Thoughts:
7/10 exercise in patience. When it works it works BEAUTIFULLY. When it doesn't, it's rage inducing and makes me regret having not refunded it. The lack of being able to do A N Y T H I N G fast is just atrocious. Structures go up slow, they get torn down slow, and when things don't work it's just a huge mess that is slow to clean up.

I'm enjoying the building, and the way the game slowly opens up new options for you as you play. Feels similar in ways to idle incremental games such as evolve, or trimps, but in 3d and with interations.

Worth a buy on sale for sure. Has pretty good controller support, but picking up objects with a joystick (due to the precise control needed), is kind of a hassle.

Appreciate that the dev has continued support for some time. Game would definitely be better with some more polish, and definitely a more obvious tutorial in the primary new game. I played the in-game tutorial, but still had to look up the wiki, and then youtube videos to understand some basic mechanics.

A fairly solid recommend.

The tutorial is so blend it teaches you a little but does not explain how in depth this game really is, be great to have a feature that tells you more of what a item does with examples on what it does like a journal. But other then that the tutorial shows you basically what the game is about.

First game play and what i have noticed so far? Apart from knowing absolutely nothing about this game it was challenge as i didn't know what to do and how to do anything. so starting out is complicated i realised the deeper u dig in the first plot you own the better your outcome was do not dig close to the edges. once you get about 15k you go buy the first plot, then the troubles can start with either lag from overfilling the vehicle or carrying to much in hand. now this is early access and i am sure eventually this will improve so its not game breaking, the auto save feature is a tad annoying as it freezes for a minute at max to save.
anyways back to the whole first plot you buy its big but kind of annoying to level out it can take you 3-6 hours to do this so be prepared to take a long time doing so. then after that i found this really enjoyable and addictive because there is so much to do and explore specially the way you obtain your drills and all that by using the big anvil and buying the blue prints. Which mind you doesn't cost as much as it should in money to obtain the blueprints i think honestly they should be around the 2k mark each at t1. As for others 6k for t2.
but for the plot its excellent and plenty of ways to build and enjoy it with endless possibilities now performance wise not sure how its gonna handle big or medium size builds That's my only issue now is the performance needs improvement and a few things added which i will list below this should be built in game without the need of mods i am hunting achievements so cannot mod at all.

1. Shopping list so you can pre order your items before collecting them or make a list so when u hit that amount in your cart it puts a line through it. which u could possible buy this shopping list from the store or even have a board at the shop where you can add the items to it and once its complete it puts a line through that item.

2. There should be a way to stack more items in the shop or buying items in bulk because loading the vehicle after loading the shop is slow at times but i see why they do it but there should be a way to increase work flow.

3. T shape pipes are very needed as this would add more ways to build and the use of pipes.

4. More land to purchase or a whole new map that will only unlock when beating the original map so the goal of this would be a checklist of things such as owning all plots, completing a certain amount of quests, reaching 2m hydro coins, and 500k quest tokens etc. this would be a challange and worth the grind and i am sure alot would agree with me and for the new map you would start over but with a price hike and new equipment and new ores/bars/gems/fruit etc.

Anyways i have now come to the conclusion that i did not recommend this due to it not meeting my needs but i now do recommend this game as its gonna make a big impact on the mining/automation gaming industry, thank you max and your team for putting all the effort into this game and with the continued updates. hopefully max actually takes the time to read my review be appreciated.",1681738259,1682051780,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

There's a lot of good stuff in there, starting with the attractive premise of a mining simulator sandbox. The graphics are serviceable, setting up an automated mining outfit feels quite satisfying, and there's significant potential for more advanced builds including logic gates for that extra bit of fine control over your operation.

Sadly, almost all of this is locked behind an incredibly tedious grind. This game not only disrespects your time, it actively hates you. Yes, you. And your family, and your dog. Especially your dog. Don't get me wrong, I know that construction and sandbox games tend to have a slow-paced start, and I'm completely fine with that, but [i]Hydroneer[/i] takes it to such a ridiculous extreme that I can no longer tolerate it. A game that's all about automating production shouldn't gate its automation features behind hours and hours of manual grinding. While this can be circumvented for the mining part by playing the fishing minigame (which isn't what I bought this game for), other features like farming have no such recourse. 

Let's stick with the farming example for a rundown on how this game does its best to waste your time in the most agonizing way it can. 
Farming equipment can't be purchased with the game's standard currency, because why should it? That would be way too convenient. No, you need special tokens, which can only be earned by completing farming-related quests, which in turn literally boils down to cooking bowls of soup for the NPCs wandering around the map. To make soup you need to plant and harvest crops, starting with tomatoes. Like all other pieces of equipment (yes, all of them; no exceptions), seeds can only be purchased individually. The packets stack to a limited degree, but you still need to pick up a seed packet, drop it in the purchase area, walk back to the counter, pick up another, drop it on the first, rinse and repeat. Sounds tedious? Oh, you sweet summer child, do I have more bad news for you. 
Now you have your seeds and your starting equipment, the only farming gear you can purchase with standard money. You haul it back to your claim, plant the seeds (individually of course) and water them... individually. You literally have to take your mining pan, fill it with water, pour it on one single aspiring tomato plant, refill the pan and repeat with the next plant. Sucks? You bet it does... and that's just the first round. You need to repeat the whole thing about once a minute until the plant is fully grown. For every. Single. Plant.
Okay. After what feels like an eternity of manual torture, you finally have a bunch of tomatoes. You cook the soup, take it to the quest giver and receive something in the ballpark of 40 tokens. That's just enough to purchase a watering can, which allows you to water an incredible FOUR plants per refill. Certainly a step up from the mining pan, but still mind-numbingly tedious. You want to automate this crap. That's what you bought this game for, after all. You vaguely remember seeing a sprinkler attachment for your water pipes back at the farming shop. You check the price tag and feel your hopes evaporate before your eyes because the damn thing costs a whopping 2,100 tokens. That's about 50 quests' worth of work just to automate the watering of a single small area of your fields, and it does nothing to help you with the harvest, the next seeding, the preparation of the harvest for cooking, the cooking itself, or any other part of the farming system. Isn't this great game design?

I freely admit that farming is the most extreme example of how [i]Hydroneer[/i] actively fights your attempt to have fun, but the rest isn't far behind. And if the game isn't wasting your time for a change, it's making your life difficult in other ways for absolutely no good reason. 
For instance, equipment comes in several tiers of increasing quality, but tools of the same type aren't readily interchangeable. A T1 drill has its power input on its backside near the ground. The T2 drill has it on its left side near the top. So instead of simply removing the old drill and plonking down a better one in its place, you have to tear apart your entire automated production line to accommodate this random BS. Oh, and it also makes it impossible to place T2 drills side by side, making them less efficient overall despite being higher on the tech tree. Again, just one example of many.

I could go on for at least another dozen paragraphs about all the nonsensical stuff in [i]Hydroneer[/i], the incomprehensible design decisions, and the near-psychotic level of contempt the devs seem to have for their customers' time, but I think I've made my point clear by now, so let's wrap it up.

One of the things that makes Hydroneer so enjoyable is crafting  mechanics. 
This attention to detail really helps to immerse the player in the game world, making it feel like they are actually mining for resources.
Hydroneer is the sense of progression it offers. Players start out with very little equipment and must work their way up to more advanced tools and machinery. This gradual progression feels incredibly satisfying, as players see their mining operation grow and become more efficient over time.

In addition to mining and building, Hydroneer also offers a trading system where players can buy and sell resources with other characters in the game world. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay, as players must decide which resources to prioritize and how to best use them to grow their business.

Overall, Hydroneer is a fantastic game that offers a unique and engaging gameplay experience. Its attention to detail, sense of progression, and trading system all make for an incredibly immersive and satisfying experience. If you're a fan of simulation games or just looking for something new and different, then Hydroneer is definitely worth checking out",1681923593,1681923593,True,1,0,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,False

You can only hold one item at a time, a tiny nugget of ore or a giant furnace are effectively the same in that regard.

It may sound like a small issue to complain about but it is incredibly frustrating and adds nothing to the challenge.  It's just a time waster.

You have a circle in the center of the screen to show what you are interacting with however dropping items has another circle to the right of the center which leads to very frustrating moments as intuitively you would think the solid blue circle in the center is what you should focus on rather then the thin outline of a circle off center.

I have seen Hydoneer for a while now but for some reason never added it to my list of similar games.  It wasn't due to the price, which is even at full price is a great deal.  I guess every time I saw it I had other things on my mind.  Well thanks to the most recent deal the game was just under $10.50 USD so I had to finally try it out when I say it on the front page.

So far I only have one session in the game, at just under 3 hours played but I wanted to give my initial thoughts.  First off I installed on my i5-7400, 16 GB RAM, SSD, 1060 GTX which is what I played with at this point, and also my Steam Deck which I will come back and re-review after some time with it played and compare controller vs. KBM play as well at that time.

Cons First:
While I did not have any crashes to desktop, I feel that I need to note that I had at least three minor freezes for upwards of 25-30 seconds that I almost went to task manager to end task.  Each of these times was during an auto-save.  I am not sure why this was as I have the auto-save set for ever 5 minutes and I only had it happen 3 times and nothing major was going on during those three times of note.    

However during general game play I had no lag or other issues.  I am going to have to do a little more research to see if I can replicate and see what the issue is.  I am up to date on my SSD and Nvidiia Drivers so I should be okay there and I haven't had problems with more intensive graphics games.  But like I said, this did not lead to crashed to desktop and resolved after less than 30 seconds.

The only other slightly bothersome issue I have is with the game play it's.  While there is a visual center dot for things like clicking on items to pick them up, press buttons and so forth, this dot / interact button is separate from the button to drop items (I am sorry I forget the actually name of said indicator at the moment).  It defaults to black, which I highly recommend you  seek out under settings and game play and change to white, or a brighter color, I went with the magenta color myself because when you are dropping it's into pans, on the anvil, the cart, a table and so on, this indicator is where the item will fall to.  

If you are like me your brain is pretty trained to expect your focal dot to be where an item will fall, but since it isn't this may throw you for a loop, even more so at night when you will have a hard time seeing the drop point.   However once you change to a brighter color it becomes a lot easier to deal with.  Maybe no one else has fought against this issue, I haven't looked at other reviews or the forums, but I would imagine it is a common problem that people new to the game run into.

Okay, so that's the Cons that I have at this point.  Not bad, both are more annoying than major and the secondary one I mentioned is fairly easy to work around with the color change.  So now let's look at the pros.

Pros:
 1) The game is done in a nice cartoonist art form.  Sorry but for decades I played Warcraft and then World of Warcraft and I like my dwarves to be cartoonish, and they are spot on here.  Technically I don't even know if they are Dwarfs of just strange looking people.  I am going to think of them as Dwarfs since it's a mining game.  I love the art work, it has some great detail, some cell shade landscape looks, and as started cartoon looks.  All in all a very enjoyable look for me verses many of the survival / crafting games I have that go for a very realistic look.  I appreciate it myself.

2) While I am still using tier one gear, I like to gaming flow.  It feels good.  Even before I really even think about automating anything I am already doing so myself with multiple buckets, pails, furnaces and so on.   Coming up with a new way to speed up my processing even with the basic tier one items has been fun.  My next session I should be about ready to move to truly mining down and becoming a Hydroneer but even before that part as it is I could easily spend a couple more hours just maximizing how to increase my output with the bottom line equipment.

3) Other than the few lockups I mentioned during autosaves, I had no other bugs or issues with FPS or studdering.  I experienced zero clipping issues.   All in all the game feels pretty solid.  I would highly recommend it to my friends.  I do not feel my money was wasted in the least purchasing the game.

As of my experiences so far with just under 3 hours I would rate the game a 9/10.   I would have rated it higher but I am not a fan of how there is a second marker for where items are going to drop, maybe if there were different difficulty levels, but to me the only parts that frustrated me were and still are to a small degree that issue..",1681759402,1681759402,True,31,0,0.739084243774414063,10,True,False,False

Inventories in other games can feel too small or unorganized, sometimes lacking the ability to quick deposit or ""grab all""; rather than go through any of that nonsense, this dev team decided not to build an inventory at all. So, you have to pick up items one at a time and place them with yet another bold approach no one asked for: an off-center drop cursor. If that wasn't spicy enough for you they throw another curve ball at you with the currency system: drop money piles on top of each-other (with the aforementioned trash drop cursor) to combine them or smack them with a tool to break them. When you go to buy an item you have to drop your money into a bucket, purchase and re-locate the item then go back for your money later. If you thought they were done with radical ideas there, think again. They took it another step further by using Steam's Remote play for multiplayer, read through other people's reviews for comments on how fun and exciting that is.

Most of the time you can't even see the dot unless you are standing directly on top of it (i.e. the Anvil).  I just can't get into the game because of this.  Also the tutorial is not bad, but needs more detail.  Things like explaining that you have to line up the dot when placing items in a furnace for example.  The placement is mentioned when you pick up an item in the beginning of the tutorial but it is not explained how it should be used.

Sadly, the trailers and the actual game play simply don't match up at all. It drops you in with effectively no tutorial. Curiously, you'll find a button to launch a direct link to the wiki, which I immediately don't see as a good sign--I shouldn't have to leave the game to understand how it works. Pushing that aside though, I read the abysmally small quick-start guide, and got to work. It took awhile for me to notice there were tools provided at the start, so after hunting those down, I began the process of shoveling dirt into a pan, filling that pan with water, brushing the dirt, and getting little chunks of whatever in it. From there, it was sprinting uphill to sell it, to then...have to carry the money physically back, and rinse and repeat (quite literally). Again, there's no in game tutorial--and the quick start guide only covers up till blacksmithing. There's drills on sale, but the in-game description and the constantly yammering NPC next to it says that it's damaged by unfiltered water. Seeing as I don't see any sort of filter available at any of the nearby stores, I refrain from buying it--due to seeing the cost of repair tools being pretty steep. After fiddling with smithing, dumping an obscene amount of ore into making a bar, only for the resulting dagger to only be worth 20 coins, I simply put the game down. It's frustrating in so many little ways, whether it be needing to drop money on top of other stacks to combine it (Why? What does this provide?) to your character making obnoxious grunting noises any time they can't interact with something for one reason or another, to just the complete lack of any kind of explanation as to how to get started beyond the barebones boring basics, I found myself feeling scammed out of my $10. Honestly, this game is nearly 3 years old now--how is it still in a state where the wiki has an in-game button dedicated to opening it, but the wiki isn't even fully filled in?

The game used to be a lot more entertaining but every update adds content while also making that content worse.

In the old days, the goal seemed simple - build a huge row of drills, get an obscene amount of materials, sell those for money.
Only because the dirt under the drill never diminishes and it's pretty easy to run them forever while AFK, money gets worthless real fast and there's nothing more to see.

Minerals now rely on more depth. OK, so move the drills a little lower but no big change there. There are even drills that give better materials that require that depth - it's a little more progression but ultimately just about colour that works the exact same way

OK, so farming comes out. People all over the map demand soup. You need to grow veggies, get the weight right for the ingredients, then run the soup out to them for a new variety of money. Only, cut veggies stack and you can only halve them. You now need to spend a while splitting and combining to try and get the quantities right. Add into this the fact the rewards barely cover the cost of the seeds and since seeds give 1-3 items and each turns back into 1 seed you feel slowed down. Now finally, add onto this finding the NPC on a map you have to stop, pick up, and check, and the distance you're running items out. The distance that would be much easier on the fast vehicle, but that barely fits anything on it.
That's all pretty tedious but the only thing the farming money rewards give is more farming goods (colours of the same mechanic) and a set of (cosmetic) greenhouse parts.

So now prospecting is a thing. Another type of money. It's the same as farming for getting quests > weighing > making > delivery but even worse because your big strip mine doesn't give nice tidy weights to make items to specification. No, you need to halve a huge 60,000 ingot over and over and over to get maybe 50 weight for maybe 80 special mining money.
Automation is going to take doing that several times since a tool to cut to weight needs the currency you're being paid for this time-sink. Oh, and you still need to collect the quests and run the products back out.

Overall, it's just becoming grindier, slower, and less intuitive. The balance in the old version was not good but instead of fixing it, the dev has just made things more punishing instead of more rewarding. You're still working towards the exact same goal of making your life automated and giving up, you're just now doing it with weights around your ankles.
The only thing the new update has added is a fix to a problem it introduces, and a new colour of goods that works in the exact same way.

Oh, and the worst part. Returning players better enjoy creating a new save because if you want achievements you better start over again from scratch.

Go look up Automachef. It's going to give you a much better experience and respect your time a lot more.",1681649007,1681649007,False,4,0,0.542360067367553711,0,True,False,False

Shame that the system is build upon this ""place thing below character at this tiny dot"" mechanci that is cumbersome as shit.

The tutorial would suffice IF AND ONLY IF the game wasn't really janky & mechanics weren't semi-counterintuitive.
The clunky-ness of it all is the main reason I cannot imagine people getting into this other than those who are deadset on making it work.

I tried, I really did. The concept of it all is neat and I love factory style games a shit ton so one that also has to do with an older setting & ""hydroneering"" was awesome to me.

That being said, placing items is a chore. Carrying gold as a singular item into a BUCKET to buy things is so odd. 
Like I get it, some things are not convenient for a reason, but seriously? I can't carry a hammer and have a coin pouch I need to lug these gold coins as my only carryable item?


It seems like the developers had a great idea and many great executions but either laziness or lack of desire to make the game accessible truly turn this into a game that requires more effort and time to enjoy.
I guess that's to be expected of the genre but typically the intro learning phase is FUN. 
Factorio I loved learning the mechanics and seeing if I could do something more efficiently. Here, it's frustrating. 

To the reviews that say it's on the players that they don't understand the items are dropped as a circle on the ground and it's an indicator I ask you this:
why?

Why have this be a core mechanic when it clearly doesn't function intuitively the way players would expect or desire it to?
Rather than excusing a negative aspect of the game as ""players don't get it"" maybe we should ask if so many players don't get it, why is it a core function of the game?",1681585778,1681585778,False,6,0,0.430914938449859619,0,True,False,False

Things I would like to see:
1. A deconstruct key separate from the pick up key. I cannot tell you how many times I have picked up some construction that I have not been able to put down again because it is obstructed by the ore/mineral I was actually trying to pick up.
2. The ability to use two hands for some object. It would be great if I could carry the fishing bucket and the rod.
3. Chutes or attachable buckets/pans. It is a genuine pain trying to pick up all of the little pieces that don't land perfectly in the buckets or pans. About 90% of my key inputs are dedicated to picking up the tiny pieces. This further contributes to the annoyances of deconstructing on accident.

you have to pick up items 1.at.a.time

Reasons I love this game:
- The gameplay loop feels different from other games were you mine resources and craft things out of them. It's mellow, there aren't really goals set for you and as of 2.1 the tutorial consists of mostly self direction and self education, otherwise a *lot* of trial and error. To my understanding, there is a playable tutorial coming in 2.2 which is supposed to launch today. I'm writing this review while I wait for it to drop.
- I like when numbers go up, and this game makes every tier or progression, every new tool or piece of machinery feel special. I enjoy when I have enough ore in a single pan that my framerate drops to zero. Sure, there can be some frustration with it but ultimately it's a game and it's not like you're punished really for the bugs and quirks. You just... keep playing more of the game.
- The game has a lot of different things to do, but nothing forces you or even nudges you in that direction (except for that NPC you end up walking by all the time who could really do with some scran). It's a lot of self-directed exploration


If you're looking for the following, you won't find them here:
-This is not a survival game. There is not hunger or thirst, you don't have to sleep
-This is not an RPG. You don't have skills or levels, the progression is more baked into the materials you find and use.
-The gameplay loop is fun, but it is not efficient. If you're looking for a really clean experience free of bugs or quirks of the physics engine, look somewhere else.",1681484270,1681484270,True,21,1,0.702319502830505371,0,True,False,False

i haven't played a game in a loong time and afterwards thought. That was a waste of time.

Buying and selling things is an absolute chore. Pick up, spin, drop into buying section hundreds of times. buy now pick up, spin drop into your truck, hundreds of times. sweet. now do it a THIRD time unloading it. i got headaches from doing that so much. 

This is worse than minecrafts replay loop. You mine stuff to build and buy things so you can build and mine more things.

This game has everything you could want from a simulation game, and it delivers it all with stunning graphics, smooth gameplay, and an addictive soundtrack.

From the moment you start playing Hydroneer, you'll be immersed in a world filled with possibilities. The game puts you in the role of a gold miner, tasked with exploring the world around you to find valuable resources and build up your mining operation. You'll need to manage your resources carefully, balancing your budget with your desire to expand your business.

One of the best things about Hydroneer is how much freedom you have to explore and create. You can build your own mining operation from scratch, designing everything from the layout of your mine to the equipment you use to extract gold from the ground. The game encourages experimentation and creativity, so you'll never run out of new things to try.

But what really sets Hydroneer apart is its attention to detail. The game's physics engine is incredibly realistic, making mining feel like a genuine physical task. Every tool and piece of machinery has its own unique properties, and learning how to use them effectively is both satisfying and challenging.

Overall, I would highly recommend Hydroneer to anyone who loves simulation games. With its gorgeous graphics, immersive gameplay, and endless possibilities for exploration and creation, this game is a true standout in the genre. Whether you're a seasoned miner or a newcomer to the world of resource management, you're sure to find something to love in Hydroneer.

The game play of Hydroneer is a mix of resource management and puzzle-solving mechanics. Players must build and operate a variety of machines to extract resources from the ground and process them into valuable materials. The game also features a variety of puzzle elements, such as finding hidden treasure and solving riddles to progress. One of the standout features of Hydroneer is its charming and colorful art style, which creates a whimsical and relaxing atmosphere. The game's mechanics are also straightforward and easy to understand, making it accessible to players of all skill levels. Additionally, Hydroneer offers a variety of customization options, allowing players to personalize their mining operations and machines. The game also features a multiplayer mode, allowing players to collaborate with friends and compete against each other. However, Hydroneer can become repetitive and grind, with players performing the same tasks over and over to extract resources. The game can also be short, with the main campaign only lasting a few hours. In conclusion, Hydroneer is a charming and accessible simulation game that offers a relaxing and enjoyable experience. Its charming art style and straightforward mechanics make it accessible to players of all skill levels, while its multiplayer mode and customization options add depth and replay ability. While it can become repetitive and may be short for some players, those looking for a casual and enjoyable mining simulator will find a satisfying experience in Hydroneer.",1680218784,1680218784,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

LOTS of running around for selling resources and buying machinery and piping ( Which better tiers are located a drives away from the first piece of land.) What's starting to discourage me from playing more at the moment is the fact that once you buy your second piece of land and with the knowledge you acquired from the first setup you've made, digging is the longest most arduous task involved out of all of them. You have shovels, pickaxes and explosives which barely scratch the surface for extensive mining. The devs removed the heavy machinery (excavator) since 2.0(may 8 2022), planning on re-adding a 'better' one in the future. It's been 10 months...

After a few hours in, disregarding the clunky controls, it feels like getting into automation of mining just doesn't make sense with no guidance at all. I understand the logic that that conveyor belts need water to be powered, I understand that drills need to be on ground, but trying to piece together these parts with the tools provided just seems frustrating. I had to go back and fish with a pole and traps, just to buy many new pipes or a few more conveyors to make something work and I just gave up. It seemed like I couldn't place conveyors if there wasn't fitting ground or because uncapped pipes fed into them, I honestly don't know.

The game feels like a puzzle to which you don't have the clues or tools to learn how to proceed. I'm not talking about a full on tutorial, but I'm just a guy who doesn't have 40 hours to figure out the exact right placement needed to make a simple conveyor belt up into a grinder.

A mining game that makes Factorio-style promises of automation and engineering, machine maintenance, piping, all the good stuff you wanna see in an industrial sim.

Then you get in and find out you have 1 hand. No toolbelt, ever. No way to place anything besides throwing it on the ground at full force like those old milk challenges. You are told to dig... with a shovel that makes a tiny indent and a bucket... Not quite as glamorous as Factorio or Satisfactory where you are bringing stuff from space with you. Oh and there's only 2 individual machines for sale at the start. You can't even craft. 

If you stick with it, though, the janky charm ramps up very quickly. So far, my favorite part is how drastic the production techniques have evolved as I played. I went from shoveling dirt into a bucket then hand washing it, to a hand-wash production line with like 6 buckets, to having 1 machine that I dump my buckets into, then 2 machines, and I pick up the dirt myself and put it in, and now I just bought a huge load of (EXPENSIVE) conveyer belts. Whereas Factorio is about progressing into more and more complex but fundamentally similar recipe flows, this one seems to be about scaling up into entirely new production processes.  Hydroneer is pretty small scale overall, and most of the game seems to be about trying to process more and more (and then more and more valuable) dirt. 

It's kind of like a job... and the game got MORE fun when I thought of it that way. That's not going to be a game for everyone and I'm not even sure I would PREFER it this way, but it's interesting. 

Overall, that's what Hydroneer is. Interesting. I got it on sale and find it very worth it. New updates are really adding a lot. Cooking is fun diversion and there's a lot of cosmetic building pieces, but it's all expensive. This seems like it could be a basis for a SUPER SUPER good MMO down the line.

Very fun game that starts small and snowballs into a whole mining operation.
There's multiplayer and splitscreen, so you can play with your friend(s)
You can do crops farming if you get bored with mining.
You can do fishing and get better fishing rods as reward for certain rare drops.
Door-dash simulator included.


flaws:

There's a feeling for lack of content, although there's a lot to be done.
Once you get into T2 gear, drills, harvesters you rack up money so fast that after not much farming you sit on millions that you can't do anything with.
It's extremely annoying buying larger quantity of materials you need. You have to click 1 by 1 everything into preferably a cart and you can imagine when you need 500straight pipes and around that amount of conveyor belts.
When you're done with buying you have to struggle through 2-5fps (on very high end machine) to get that to your plot.
There's also fps problems once your mining operation goes bigger.
And never forget to turn off your machines before you save & quit the game.

This is a game that you can really get into. A lot of hidden gems, literally and figuratively.
Plays pretty chill if you want it to be - progress at your own speed.
Or, download some mods to add chaos into your game! (Or just quality of life, haha)
Currently, there's not an ""end goal"", so it doesn't push the same buttons as some other action/roleplaying games.
... but! there are plenty of side-games (Farming, [Redacted], and automation, for example) to keep you occupied with self-defined goals. Oh, actually, with the next update, there's gonna be some Steam achievements, so there will be some goals baked in soon!

Also, the logic (wire/cable/automation) system is janky, but if you have a head for maths/programming you can do some crazy things with it.

However the problem is, that while sure, it CAN be fun in spurts... it's more frustrating than anything.  What's more, it's as if the developer simply doesn't either have a clue how to fix the issues that players have... or has become so invested with his own goal for the end game that he simply ignores the issues.  

The number one issue this game has, is tied to its physics calculations. Which, if you know anything about the game itself, or what it claims to be, is a MAJOR problem. A problem which isn't really being addressed. The developer regularly posts streams about how he's making entirely new sections of the game... and yet never touches on the problems with physics.

It doesn't matter where you look, as a player you will inevitably run into physics issues with this game.  From things you just dropped being thrown off across the map due to the weird physics calculations; to vehicles like the mining truck simply being useless due to an inability to drive up a simple ramp.

Stop and think about that part people. A mining truck CAN NOT drive up a player placed ramp.  Now the truck doesn't just stop and sit there. Oh no, it will suddenly be punted into the air. If you're lucky, it comes back down in a place you can use it. Most of the time though this thing goes flying through the air and leaves you dizzy and frustrated.  All because the developer can't be bothered to go ""oh, you know what, instead of doing this whole new expansion, let's sit down and put some serious time and work into fixing these physics issues."" 

I want to like this game... really I do. However I can't. I've over 100 hours in it, and were it not so frustrating seeing my hard work just get exploded across the map because of some bad physics calculations; I like would have far more.

2.0 Update is out... now where to start.  It's... broken.  There seems to be a bug where, randomly, the game will decide to just completely wipe your save. So all the work you've done, regardless of how many hours you put into the game, just poof, it's like you never touched the thing. Also, all your tools, money, and everything is gone, forcing you to start over and completely forget that save.

Compound that with tools like the 'hand sorter' that either yeets things over the pans you put down, or just decides to lag out and spill everything on the ground,  a curious, if not mind numbingly annoying decision to make players go on a hunt to figure out where the previously easy to find, and equally easy to use stock markets locations,  and an overall inflation of prices of the various better tools... and I'm starting to wonder why I even bother with the game.  Realistically speaking, were it even possible at this point, I'd request a refund, because I really don't want to bother with the headache of dealing with a game that's so buggy, and so very poorly thought out.  Buyer beware.  The game is NOT worth the price that's being asked.

I will say this, remember the mining truck? Well they fixed its ability to go up, or down a ramp.  And by fixed, I mean completely removed it from the game.  Which unless you particularly like using various expensive mining drills, or having to move a load of dirt by hand... makes the game so tedious that it's just not worth bothering with.  It's as if the developers looked at the game and said ""Well we can't fix this, so eh, scrap it.""  They claim to have 'more coming'... but given how they said ""We'll have multiplayer"" and then gave users a janky kind of split screen... something that games stopped doing in the 90's... well I don't hold out much hope of them actually fulfilling their promises.

That's probably what angers me the most.  The developers promise, promise, promise... and never really deliver.  It's like they expect you, the purchaser, to be dumb enough to accept whatever junk they throw at a wall in the hopes that something... anything... sticks.  Sadly, there's a lot of people out there who do just that, which in turn leads to things like that janky, failure of a multi player.  It's not hard to do multiplayer in unity. Other games have done full on multi player, and didn't have to default to split screen.  So what was the difference here?  

In the end, this ""major update"" is little more than ""Added 2 new areas to mine, removed useful mining vehicles,  moved/hid sell points, and jacked the prices on machines up enough to make the grind even worse.""  It's not an update, but little better than a 'content patch'.

Edit 2.

Oh it only gets worse. I mean seriously. The developer can't seem to figure out what he wants to actually do. Now a game that is marketed as a mining game... is delving into FARMING?  Come on Dev, pick something and stick with it!

The more these non-updates come out, that keep changing whatever direction the game is going in, the more I start to think that the game is just some kind of scam aimed at milking users for all the cash he can.  Always changing the direction of the game when popularity starts falling of.

Run, don't walk, RUN from this one as fast as you can. It's not worth it.

Edit:  So, here's a new 'update' to this review. Something you should seriously consider prior to even looking at the game.

Whatever you do, you must only say good things about the game in the discussions... else you'll get banned. Now, sure, I know that banning any dissenting comments, or even users from a Steam Discussion is directly against Valve's own rules for developers.... but based off my own recent experience where I dared answer a question honestly about whether or not the game, in its current state, is even worth buying with an unequivocal no... I have now been banned from the discussions. I do plan on contacting Valve in regards to this behavior though.",1636500432,1677089825,False,5,0,0.536818623542785645,0,True,False,False

This game fits the bill perfectly, with gameplay centered around optimizing your own mine and/or farm, without any particular end goal other than to enjoy the process. 

Initially, the game may feel a bit repetitive, but as you progress, you can automate many of the more tedious tasks, allowing you to focus on the more advanced aspects of the game. I found myself getting lost in the decorating and optimizing of my mine and farm, which added a fun and creative element to the gameplay. As you continue to play, the game becomes more complex and satisfying, with plenty of challenges to keep things interesting.

What really sets this game apart is its welcoming community. In my experience, the community is incredibly supportive and helpful, and I was pleasantly surprised to be able to reach out to one of the developers and hear back in under 48 hours helping me with a game bug, and based on what I read from the patch notes after that, it looks like it may have been addressed. Having played many games over the years, I can confidently say that this community is one of the most helpful and supportive I've encountered.

Overall, if you're looking for a laid-back game to relax and unwind with, this game may be worth checking out. It has a lot of animal crossing appeal, where you are never really done as it wasn’t the point. While it may not be the most adrenaline-inducing game out there, it offers a stress-free experience and a supportive community that can make for a truly enjoyable gaming experience.

After you get mk2 miners there's little progression aside from making your ""factory"" bigger. It feels like minecraft pre 1.16 (nether update); there's huge potential and the possibilities are endless but you are limited to the ""build more bigger"" gameplay loop. There's NO automatic crafting except jewel compression and smelting which functions as a lag reducer masquerading as wealth and utility conversion. The UI is creative and I love the immersion of a physical inventory system but it's not very user friendly or intuitive. Performance is also pretty bad. If you want a factory game with a 3rd dimension and a polished ""feel"" spend twice the price and get Satisfactory.

The performance is bad and has been bad for years. On a new save that I just started, the game drops frames when turning the camera. That alone is enough to not recommend the game. I have a fairly good rig that runs far more intensive games, so I was surprised that this game (which does not look good compared to say, dyson sphere program) still cannot consistently run well. The game is mechanically simpler than minecraft and should not have performance issues on high end hardware.

I appreciate that the developer has put in work to add things like NPC's and more locations and even streamline the code, but when the performance is this bad and basic UI/UX stuff is still missing 2 years down the line, I can't recommend it. 

If the game ever moves away from it's busywork dropping/carrying gameplay and fixes the performance issues I will update the review.

----
Background: I bought this way back and returned recently to find the same asinine ""no inventory"" and ""dropping reticle"" systems never went away. I had gotten fairly far with the automation when I first played the game but there doesn't seem to be any direction from the developer to reduce all the running and dragging you have to do. I thought the game would get better as you play, but it just adds layers of busywork instead of challenges. 

You get vehicles and automation to replace your cart but you are still loading and unloading everything. Vehicles do not remove the busywork of running around delivering things or sloppily dropping things on top of each other instead of having an action to interact with your currently held item. The control scheme is sloppy but the current player-base will defend it because it's ""hardcore"". 

Fans of the game will say the game isn't for you if you suggest any changes so it doesn't look like the developer will ever change these things.",1675575717,1675575717,False,2,0,0.480158746242523193,0,True,False,False

My main issue was the performance, and while it's still not perfect (particularly when picking up a pan with a lot of ore chunks etc in it, which is odd since it shouldn't be calculating physics for them if they're locked to a container) it's a LOT better than it was when I last reviewed.
I still like the whole no inventory thing. It can get a bit tedious carrying things like foundations, and torches that don't want to stay in the cart, but generally it's kinda relaxing organising everything right there in-world. Things lock to containers when their physics settles, so you're not kicking over buckets and having your ore chunks spill all over the place. You WILL find plenty of other ways to spill 100 ore chunks all over the floor and have to pick them all up, though.
Overall there's a few Weird Design Decisions but it works pretty well now. Though I did turn voice off pretty quick because I might scream if I have to hear the word 'scran' again.",1611164514,1675515905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have fun tinkering and enjoy a challenging game where the only challenge is how far you can push your imagination in building and automation, this fits the bill. Has a pretty active mod community. I recommend checking it out for bulk buying and such.
Caveat Emptor - If your'e expecting to hit an ""I"" key and open your inventory (hint-there isn't one) or some backpack that can hold infinite items (hint-there isn't one), you may not want this game. Without mods, it's tedious transporting materials. It's a physical inventory and not a virtual one. Which means you lug each individual piece around with you either 1 at a time on your person or multiples in your vehicle. This is likely why I like the game so much - because you have to touch everything. May not be your cup of tea if that turns you off. 
The game is fun and the gameplay loop is basically ""How much money can I make and how far can I stretch this automation?""

Somewhat fun, yes, especially early on, but it's really frustrating overall.

Main problems:

1) bugs.   

Items disappearing, random freezes, long freezes during saving, and a total slowdown if you try to move too many items (few hundred will do it, eg a pan of resources)

2) tedium

Digging a bloody hole takes ages.  Moving earth takes 10 times more.   Moving items around  is slow.  And you have to re-build every single bit.  The program forgets item orientation, and rotating is not that intuitive either. (it's not even explained!)  Need I go on?  

3) total lack of information

Apart from some very basic youtube tutorial you get nothing.  Unless you consider hieroglyphs helpful.  (We have invented proper writing, why try to communicate with ambiguous images?)  The in-game descriptions of machines, logic pieces, etc are skeletal at best.  It's nearly impossible to figure things out on your own, since they aren't entirely logical - it certainly is very hard without some prior knowledge of some parts at least.   


[b]Summary:[/b]

Unless you are a time millionaire and want to punish yourself, I can't recommend it.  

You're expected to build logic circuits and networks of machines, building takes a significant amount of time due to the lack of proper building tools (eg multi-select), and you'll have to keep running to the shops (slow, you have to pack up 10 items to buy 10, no way to do it on one go!) and re-build things because of the lack of information.  

This combination is unforgivable in my opinion, hence the negative review.  

Alternatively you can copy/build stuff others have already figured out and posted online - but where is the fun in that?

I appreciate the attempt at originality, but it is utterly atrocious.

One might dismiss the tedium of picking up and dropping 4 or 5 different objects to accomplish a basic task like panning for gold so you can get started. That can be said to be a matter of taste. However, when you've got a pan full of hundreds of nuggets, you have no options except insane infuriating ones. Sort them by hand? Will take you an hour. Dump them into a sorting machine? You'll probably miss, and the machine will miss the pans you set up to catch the output. Use a magnet tool to police the mess you just made? It's garbage, won't attract what you want it to, and will attract what you don't want it to. Plus more than a few dozen nuggets will destroy your framerate and make you vastly more likely to miss the toilet bowl. No words can express how rage-inducing it is to see an explosion of nuggets go all over the place because you missed your lay-up.

My advice to the developer would be to abandon this failed attempt at item mechanics, and give the player pockets, at LEAST for resources.

It's very grind-y in the beginning, which I love, but then it's also very easy - almost too easy - to set yourself up with an automated mining place and making big bucks for no real reason. I mean there's nothing to really spend your money on besides expanding your automatic mining ""factory"" but even then it just makes your game lag more than it's worth.

I really do love smelting my ores and weighing them to see how much they're worth - I almost feel compulsive about having to make weapons or jewelry that are worth more than my last! .. but after a while it feels really pointless because it's basically the only thing I do in this game since everything is already running on it's own. I usually end up playing on my phone with this game going in the background on my computer.. and that's not really cool. 

It also needs some readjustments for snapping things to place - some times it feels like I've spent most of my time in this game trying to get my pipes in the right place. It is incredibly frustrating sometimes, especially when you haven't hammered something into place and accidentally pick it up again (lmao)
Collision is also crazy in this game - things will fly and bounce away into nothingness very frequently. 
I'm also experiencing some of the worst lag ever recently - out of nowhere - when I start my machines up. Like it's so bad I can't do anything!
All in all, I will probably come back to see how this game is doing in a near future, and will hopefully be able to leave a more positive comment on here! I very much love the concept of this game and I don't regret spending money on it!
I hate pressing the ""no"" on wheter or not I recommend this game, because I know there are people who have better patience than I do with the things I find negative in the game. I do recommend people to at least try the game out - but for the purpose of my comment I'll tick the ""no"" for now.

Update 2023 
I actually did end up playing this again after a later update and I had a really good time!
I sadly don't have the time to play many games these days but I know I will gladly come back to this game when the time arrives.
I noticed that a lot of the things that made my previous playing experience negative had been tweaked and worked on and I honestly don't have anything negative to say this time!

It's actually quite amazing that this game is built with Unreal ShitForAnEngine and manages to run almost always at 114ish fps.

There are a few bad pracrice coding issues the devs should probably address, like - I'm willing to bet - Tick Aggregation on mining machines (add enough and the frames start to drop, which indicates their on tick event is individualized).

Collisions are shit, that's the engine however. There really isn't all that much a developer can do. Maybe buy and use a different physics engine - like Havok - which sure does cut into the profit margin a wee bit but is much more reliable than anything the Epic team touches...

Overall, the item progression / money acquisition is simple and logical enough that you can just sit there and figure stuff out.

There are some lazy design choices that the devs are peddling as ""wanting people to have to think to build"".
They appear most obvious in the logic nodes proably, where you have >= but not <= (and all you have to do is turn the piece around). One of the not so clear ones is the lack of cross intersections on all pipes.

I haven't even began to peruse the house building items, and there is a ton of them, which makes playing and building fun, as you wait for resources to gather up.

Overall, the game is well worth its money.

Special note, the voxel system for digging is nicer than one would expect. And the tools provided are rather spot on. It's not even close to no man's sky in terms of *fun factor* of terrain manipulation, but if you want to go full dwarve and dig up a copy of moria by pickaxe, this is the game for it XD",1673941893,1673941893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not that it is boring exactly, but the bugs combined with janky controls.Placing buildable items is a nightmare, I somehow managed to place an item under the ground, so I had to dig it up to place it again. Items falling through the ground or flying off into the sky to never see them again, so you can go buy another bucket or another shovel, this is exacerbated by controls, which disallows you to place an item on the ground, you have to drop it, which can cause it to fall somewhere you don't want to, which can cause it to fly away or fall through the ground. Manual handling of individual ores is insanely annoying, as spilling the ores into a crucible may cause it to spill the ores everywhere but the crucible, if the game so decides. Oh and hitting the crucible onto a furnace? I mean, the crucible visibly heats up, if it is in a correct place, that's great! Until you need to spill the melted iron into a mold, and place the crucible back, and now the visibly heating up is useless, because it is heated up already and you can't notice it, so place it back, only to find out later it was not heating and now you have to wait until it heats up again.

I originally played this game when it was fairly new, and I excused this because it was new and decided to wait until I play again, so that they have time to fix these issues.

It is incredibly grindy (especially the first hour), forced to watch YouTube videos to understand the basic mechanics, simple and unbalanced progression system, no goals to work towards, and it is incredibly buggy.

During my short time paying the game I encountered 7 game disrupting bugs that has no place in a game that is past early access:

-Your main truck spazzes out and flies endlessly when it has stuff in the back of it. The reset vehicle button doesn't work as expected.
-I get stuck suspended between terrain and buildings and need to force unstuck myself.
-I dropped money on the ground and it clipped through the floor. Twice. Had to cheat more money in to regain my losses.
-Building placement is janky as hell. Can't place buildings where I think I should be able to, and can place them where I shouldn't (like completely submerged underground).
-Crops stop regrowing after a harvest without any visual indication of that. Had to go to Reddit to figure out they need to be cut down and replanted after a harvest.
-The game drops to single digit FPS when picking up a bucket full of gems.
-Crashed to desktop multiple times randomly, losing unsaved progress.

The new updates have breathed new life into the game. Vehicles now feel 'real', no longer are there weird glitches happening all the time with driving or with loose items, the NPCs add a bit of life to the game (I'd still like to see a lot more personally, but what's there is good). I haven't even gotten to the new farming content yet, which is the first time I've really felt like I've had to come back and revisit the game for a second sitting since I purchased it. It's beginning to morph into a legitimately great game and I'm thrilled for the devs - there's a lot of love being poured into this. The updates aren't _frequent_ but they're consistent, and consistently good.

Overall, I'd say yeah, give it a try. It's a bit different than other titles in the genre but it's a cute little gem nonetheless. Happy to be changing this from a negative to a positive.

---ORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW---

UPDATE:

New major release has a lot of gameplay improvements but is still insanely buggy right now. Review on its way to being positive, but I'm still judging pretty harshly given that this is clearly an early access game billed as a completed game.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Will probably change this to positive at some point, but right now I can't. I had to check the store page to confirm it really wasn't early access, because it sure feels like it. There are the beginnings of a GREAT game here, but a lot of work needs to be put into the polish at this point.

PROS:

- Fun concepts
- Great graphics (not too flashy, very cohesive, good lighting and fun style)
- The voxel handling is mostly okay - digging really feels like you're digging, which is a hard thing to achieve.
- The shopping system is really fun. It feels realistic and satisfying loading up and taking away a haul.
- The early game is actually a lot of fun. I like having to do the work manually and build up to automation. Really makes you appreciate the game and makes the work feel worthwhile. The dig/water/scrub/smelt/craft flow is awesome and rewarding.

CONS

- SLOW. This game is soooo sloooowwwww to progress in. I saved up a bunch of gold before I started building automation - when I had enough to buy the parts, It took me an hour just to build a basic mining rig, and it was NOT a fun experience.
- The balance is very off. Things seem to cost a normal amount, but you have to buy a LOT in order to do anything interesting. The pipe system is fun but the proportions are tiny and cumbersome to work with, and the water pressure part is aggravating due to water being kind of far from any of your rigs.
- The physics are extremely buggy; items fall through the ground _often_, and your truck will randomly fly through the air to another part of the map without notice.
- It's not very clear how some things word - this is arguably a pro as I sometimes find this exciting, but there is no ""affordance"" (UX term) given by many of the items nor the piping systems.
- Item placement is annoying and buggy - you are allowed to place items under the ground, even deeper than the lowest diggable point, which makes no sense. Also, you can place e.g. two pipes in the same spot and it's a tossup how the game will react.
- It's quiet - no music, no people walking around, no voices. Just subtle sound effects (admittedly the ones that are there are quite pleasant to hear - there just aren't many).

SUGGESTIONS TO THE DEV(s):

- Fix the physics. Really. It's really bad. Fearing my stuff is going to fall through the ground is an awful feeling, and getting launched a mile into the air isn't fun either.
- Make straight pipes expandable, even if you raise the price 10x. Having to buy and then load 100 pieces into the truck just to get _anything_ running is tedious and kills any joy I had.
- Not sure if this is technically feasible, but make the entire underground diggable - not just the small plots. Enforce boundaries, sure, but I can see myself hitting the end of the game content and being frustrated.
- Add some music and ambient environment effects. The atmosphere is too quiet.
- Explain what the different trucks do. Why do three different colored trucks exist that are the same price but still more expensive than the default truck, which looks the same?
- The smelting process seems like I'm wasting ores because the bars cap out at a certain point, but there's no indication as to how to make sure.
- Make the drop point position (the green circle) configurable. It's incredibly awkward trying to chance a drop into a bucket or something - I spend maybe 20% of my time picking shit up because the aim was 1 pixel off.",1595601111,1673459926,True,0,0,0.499273777008056641,0,True,False,False

The idea is fine and it's a neat concept that everything is a physical object instead of just an image in an inventory, but that concept is also a problem as it means you have to constantly move tiny little things around.

Starting with the very basic mechanic of dig dirt and put dirt in bucket requires constantly moving the camera from side to side. Once you put dirt in basin and brush the thing, you then again have to move every single nugget one by one, which again means moving the camera all over repeatedly. This constant and repeated need to moving the camera back and forth is nauseating and by itself makes the game unplayable for anyone prone to motion sickness. And it does not help that the drop marker is always somewhere off to the side instead of where you're looking, so you have to look around to figure out where the stuff you drop will end up.

Given the basic mechanics of the game I don't see any simple fix to avoid the motion sickness because it requires changing how it works so you don't have to move the camera as much. Basic things like make stuff drop where the crosshair is pointing and being able to pick up more than 1 thing at a time would go a long way (and make the game a lot more intuitive), but the digging mechanic has to be totally redone for this to be possible.

Essentially, the biggest problem with the way the game works is that it's first person. If it was in third person the mechanics would be far less nauseating, but not any less tedious.",1673375723,1673375723,False,1,0,0.481132060289382935,0,True,False,False

- resources pilling up on conveyors
- resources staying stuck int he air
- crashes when using the magnet
- trucks jumping in the air and staying there (with ALL MY MONEY IN IT).

Gameplay is also very clunky. 
- The lack of inventory makes for really difficult interactions. They want you to drop and pour things, but those movements are just not precise enough. pouring molten metal works fine. I don't know why they don't make all these actions work the same.
- Grabbing & using tools and objects looks like a 1980s game.
- placing pipes is surprisingly difficult, when it's one of the core action of the game. If I point at a pipe with another, it means I want to connect them. I don't understand why they don't take the hint. Instead, you have to move around so that the pipe lands where you want it. It's ridiculous. Just take any other game and placing objects isn't that bad.

I know this is early access, but Early Access should be missing features, not that the core mechanics are broken (as in Satisfactory and Dyson Sphere Program).

Just can't recommend this at this point.

decided to give the game another go, since there'd been a major update and a few patches.
another six hours. in which very little was accomplished, a great deal of time was spent fighting the clunky gameplay, and i've renewed my resolve to not come back to this game anytime soon.

last patch notes tells me vehicles were reworked! but nothing about how. i [b]do[/b] know that vehicle steering is still tied to framerate, against all rationality, so if you have your framerate fixed at 30 fps (which the game lets you do in the settings ui, and there are many rational reasons for a player to choose to do so), steering is misery (and this isn't just the trucks; carts are vehicles too). also controller turning is also tied to framerate. good luck with that if you don't have rock solid fps.

gameflow is still a trainwreck. no inventory, no ability to move things in bulk in any kind of rational manner aside from small pans of tiny objects. need a bunch of building supplies? yeah, tedious manual labor. need to rework your layout? more tedious manual labor. want to get a nice smooth span of dirt? play the rake gambling game, there's no way to get it to work consistently in vanilla (and i couldn't bring myself to start messing around seriously with mods to find out if it can be fixed properly that way).

for that matter i couldn't even bring myself to get as far as doing crops, because i was so miserable just trying to get to basic automation going; i'm now convinced the hand sorters are a malicious trap, since the belt versions aren't much more expensive and are substantially less frustrating. [i]less[/i], mind you. all automation in this game is still misery.

pretty much everything from the previous version of my review still stands (the objectives might be stretched out by farming, maybe, but i didn't get there and i doubt it addresses the fundamental issues), so i've left the rest unaltered.

original may 12, 2022 review:
it's a cute game, with a fairly clear premise, with a dedicated dev team. there's just not enough to it, and there are enough user experience flaws that even at the current sale price ($7 usd) i can't in good conscience recommend it.

content-wise, there's six dig sites, each with different vistas, there's a few shopping areas, and a little bit of explorable territory that has no gameplay impact. unfortunately, unless you are into hunting hidden items, you can easily see most of what the game has to offer without ever crossing into 'tier 2' equipment. after you get through a little of the obligatory hand mining, the tier 1 harvester (you only need one, bought by the starter plot) and some tier 1 drills (you can buy one with the harvester) will easily produce quite a lot of money, and while it will keep you busy for a while buying more automation framework (conveyor belts, pipes, repair tools, better pipes, automation for repair, etc), there hits a point with just tier 1 machinery where you are producing money faster than you can spend it. once you hit this threshold -- i did with just six tier 1 drills in a second digsite -- there is little actual pressure to continue on to tier 2 equipment unless you just really want to see bigger numbers.

to be clear: you don't earn money faster than you can find things you want to buy, but faster than [i]you are capable of actually spending it[/i]. this gets into the user experience flaws: you have to buy things one at a time, moreover, the process for purchasing things is especially laborious due to the dev's choice to avoid anything menu-like. pick up item, put it in purchase area, repeat, until you have as many things as you want to buy (or can fit into the purchase area, if you aren't using a cart), then you put money into the pay bin, hit a button... and then you have to get the stuff back home. usually by loading it into a truck. at which point you have to laboriously unload it, optionally staging it somewhere before you start building things.

there is no way for this to move more quickly. there are no reasonable ways of packaging objects for ease of movement or storage. you cannot buy things in bulk. everything is, by design, exceedingly laborious.

and all of this is without getting into the persistent issues: hydroneer 2.0 did function as an effective rewrite of the game's logic, which greatly improved the physics stability, but there are still a large number of issues with regards to arbitrary framerate issues (in truth [b]simulation rate[/b] issues, but simulation rate and framerate are tragically linked) which result in effectively punishing the player for trying to buy too many things at once. especially since while the game is at a low frame/simulation rate, physics for the vehicles get increasingly dodgy, to the point where they can rapidly become undriveable. while i'd like to think these problems could be solved, the fact the developer didn't think solving these problems warranted more time before shipping the update is unfortunate.

i'll probably check the game out again in the next major update, and maybe i'll flip my recommendation around at that point, but right now i just don't see the game as worth it for most players.

and as for my current playtime of 73.9 hours as of this writing: only 37.1 hours are from the 2.0 update, the previous were from my failed attempts at getting automation going because the pre-2.0 physics were unbearable. it *has* improved markedly. it could improve more. but the game still isn't there just yet.",1652422935,1672649814,False,160,25,0.620226740837097168,23,True,False,False

It does have its ups and its downs, but it is definitely more positive than negative.

It has a steep learning curve in the early game and little more than a YouTube video from the Devs to help guide you. This video (or at least watching another guide to starting from YoutTube) is critical to success as it’s not intuitive!

But getting over that learning curve, you learn some of the many charms of this game!

You have no inventory, so you have to manage everything a little more than you might in most games. You can only pick up one item at a time, so you end up having to put things in a container and carrying that. Or you load up one of the vehicles and move things about that way. This can get a little annoying when doing a big project, but mostly adds to the complexity/problem solving aspect of the game!

Next you have 2 cursors - one for picking up items or using them on things, and another for where you’ll drop items. Again, not intuitive, but once you get used to it, can be used to great effect.

The begins the grind - you start at the beginning of your mining journey panning for resources - dig dirt, wash it, get stuff. This can be painful, but there are strategies to optimise this (YouTube to the rescue again). But basically you do a bunch of panning & earn a bit of money selling your resources to the Jeweller.

Some people then use this money to buy a fishing rod & go fishing - personally I find fishing a bit boring and beyond completing the quests to upgrade to the T8 fishing pole rarely do it - and then only when I’m waiting around for other things. I also find this to be much slower than going back to mining more.

The alternative is, you can use your money to buy some equipment to make things easier - unfortunately, you likely didn’t make lots, so you’re still on the hand panning, but you can make this a lot easier for yourself with the new equipment. Also new equipment will make it easier to get as low as possible - the lower you go in this game the heavier the resources you get from the same action. So, another hand panning session, and possibly a bit of processing (depends how much you got from the first session, if you had enough to buy everything that would be useful) and it’s off to the Jeweller again!

You’re likely to have enough money now (if not it’ll be another panning session for you) to start moving into automation. Then it’s drills (that perpetually dig dirt for you) and harvesters (that do the cleaning for you) and conveyors (to move it all around) and pipes (to power it all).

If you’ve done your research beforehand, even at a leisurely pace, it’ll only really take you an hour to get to this point.

There are more dig sites available to buy for reasonable prices (if you’ve done particularly well with your panning, you’ve probably got enough to go buy one before setting up automation) the starting plot is limited to only a certain depth.

More drills (including the next tier) can be crafted at an old dwarven mine “Icehelm” which is a cool little progression mechanic.

There’s farming as well now! I recommend having made yourself a fair bit of money before diving into farming - it’s totally optional, gets you a different currency, which only buys more farming items - but could probably be started as soon as you have enough money to buy the basic equipment.

Farming is fun - not only do you have to make a farm, you have to find customers who want soup, cook soup to their orders, then deliver it to them. Again, it can feel a little grindy at times, but the progression feels real and purposeful.

There’s a load of vehicles to help with things like moving stuff about, but also more specific things like collecting crops, sowing seed and flattening land.

There are building pieces which can be used to construct buildings and interiors. Some players have made pretty buildings, others have made entire complexes of buildings.

There’s even a logic system to automate the automation further.

There’s a lovely discord community full of friendly and helpful players if you get stuck/need help figuring something out. And a whole community of modders, adding in community requests, the devs don’t feel fit the game.

Yes, there’s problems - the obvious lack of an in game tutorial system. The game occasionally throws a spanner in the works when someone does something not anticipated. Early game/late game needs a bit of a rebalance. The game eventually “runs out of content”. But these are mostly being addressed - there are regular bug fixes whenever something becomes apparent, not just someone derping into ridiculous situations. Things are regularly reviewed to improve them (the game balance is much better than it was). There are regular free major updates adding more content.

The multiplayer (up to 4P) is only streamed split screen at the minute, what’s more, only one person can use mouse and keyboard - everyone else needs to use controllers. This might be a deal breaker for some people. Personally I don’t multiplayer that often, and when I do, it’s tolerable. The devs explain that the tools aren’t available given the mass of objects in a normal hydroneer save - it’d be like your playing a game of pool and on player 1’s screen the black ball goes down the hole, but on player 2’s screen the black ball jumps the cushion and rolls away from the table - you want everything to be the same for both players, else things are gonna get funky real fast!

The game starts using the best settings it can - I’ve got a good pc, but my game turned into a slideshow. Unless you have a serious computing rig (graphics are key to this game) I suggest the first thing you do is reduce the graphics settings.

Couple of things to bear in mind before complaining - This was mostly created by a single dev, and the team is still pretty small. The cost for this game is still really low, given the quality of the game.


SUMMARY

As I said, this game is great. It’s original and quirky - in a good way. It offers progression and development. At the time of writing this, I’ve played 150 hours and I’m far from having experienced everything. Yes I can see content running out, but they are adding more all the time. Also, it’s a sandbox game, there’s more than one way to skin every cat, obviously some are more efficient than others, but figuring out all the variations adds many hours of fun. While not for everyone, I do recommend checking it out and giving it a fair chance to get used to the control system.

Most of my previous grievances have been remedied; whether by update, IDT10T, or PEBKAC realization.
After giving it another go and an update, my only current complaint is the turn speed when using a Steam Controller and PlayTogether multiplayer. I turn so slowly it is like watching a 97 year with a walking cane that gives you a ""fear they'll fall over if they move faster"" jolt every 3-0.5 seconds. That, and I haven't figured out (or looked up the button combos to, since I'm 2nd Player) how to rotate items to set them down and connect, lmao. All my movements via Steam Controller feel clunky. After a few hours' playtime, it ""feels"" like I process dirt to ore/gems at <10% the rate of the host who uses mouse+keyboard. The hardest part of the game is now pointing at and clicking the right thing; the slowest part is moving my POV centerspot. Maybe I need to change my controller profile settings before joining the PlayTogether session??

===Original Review===
The general outline of the game is good, but implementation leaves something to be desired. Methods to make the painfully boring primary loop (shoveling dirt and cleaning it) less painful are punished by making your dirt and effort disappear. Oh, I'm sorry, is there water in your bucket? Watch all of the dirt you just dumped into it disappear from the world! Oh, I'm sorry, did you put dirt directly into the pan instead of filling the bucket first? You can no longer put any dirt into the bucket and get crap items after cleaning it! Oh, I'm sorry, did you dump dirt into the bucket after putting dirt directly into it? Watch it become unusable! Oh, I'm sorry, did you think putting your bucket in the stream would makes things faster? Refer to the first game-induced griefing described earlier.",1671330261,1672210435,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

This game focuses on aesthetic and presentation to the detriment of building. Some people will like that, as everything you build feels impactful, but that feeling is because the game hamstrings you with poor tools for constructing inside a sandbox.

Buying and laying down an object is tedious, because each piece needs to be picked up and placed 3 times. Once when taking a copy to put on the checkout pad, again to load onto truck, and then a 3rd time to place it where you want. Sometimes 4 if you want to unload your stuff from your truck closer to the build site.

The ""sandbox"" label is well deserved, because there aren't much in the way of new resources, items, processes, etc to get. I got there within the few hours of playtime I had.

As for performance, I have 10 second full pauses I can't understand the cause of that happen somewhere on the order of every 20-60mins, very randomly. Game straight up stops all movement/video except audio. There are tiny pauses during saves, but its the full 10 second pauses that are frustrating.

The game's lighting feels overly harsh, with sunset/sunrise lasting too long and providing inadequate light for too long. The light sources that can be bought are mediocre and feel like a waste of money. Sleeping is a weird mechanic that feels misplaced, as the game isn't survival.

Placing objects is hard because snapping to the grid is frustrating, and it won't intelligently snap to parts. Trying to drop something from your hands is hard because your shovel will clip an oversized collision mesh, even though visually it isn't touching anything at all. This then begins a frustrating ""dance"" to figure out where its safe to drop something, all the while the character's annoying grunt sound plays as the only feedback something is wrong.

Voice lines are repeated frequently, and there are few voice lines. Most characters share the same voice lines.

What made me give up, was in realizing I would hate the redesign process. If I designed it wrong, I'd have to individually deconstruct everything. If I wanted to use my stuff elsewhere, I'd have to deconstruct, load, move, and reconstruct one piece at a time. I had just got the machines for self-drilling, harvesting, sorting, and smelting. Would I want to slowly rebuild all of that? Knowing a good chunk of that time would be driving back and forth to the shops, slowly buying items? I kept thinking ""not really...""

After foreseeing that future, I realized other construction games spoiled me with all kinds of tools, items, mechanics, and more that make building and creating fun; this game has none of those tools. Its all about the moment-to-moment feel of individually placing each part and ""living"" in a sandbox with wooden NPCs and destructible terrain in designated sandbox only areas.",1671889027,1671889027,False,1,0,0.490196079015731812,0,True,False,False

The map is interesting to look at, and there are a few things to figure out early on so it takes a while to figure out how bad it is.

Since they removed the Excavator vehicle digging large areas for deeper drilling is hours of hacking with a pick/rake. It's completely ridiculous and ruins things when you start getting later in to the game.

Consider buying this game IF you've played and enjoyed Satisfactory or Factorio AND you've gotten bored with those games AND IF you can get Hydroneer on sale. Even then, you might want to steer clear of this boring time sink.

Hydroneer drops you into the game with no guidance and only a link to a YouTube tutorial that is light on details. The interface is arduous and unnecessarily cumbersome; especially in the early part of the game. You can only pick up one item at a time which makes for gameplay designed to obscure a lack of content with tedious repetition. Imagine spending 15 minutes mining a bucket full of ore only to accidentally left click and dump all 50 tiny ore pieces all over the ground. The first few hours of the game for me were a ""pick up small things"" simulator. There's a magnet available for purchase deeper in the game but this should really be made apparent and available immediately to new players.

The game is fraught with ill conceived design decisions. For example: to mine resources you need both a drill and a harvester that each require an input pipe for water. The drill exhumes the dirt and drops it one block down into the top of the harvester so the ore can be extracted. However, these two pieces of equipment don't fit neatly together which results in the most common setup being a floating drill that players shovel dirt back under to get it to work. The game seems to go out of its way to make things difficult.   Since you can only pick up one thing at a time you'll make thousands of back and forth trips between shops and vehicles to move one pipe segment at a time. 

If you cut all this tedium out of the game you'd have a few hours of content at most and that's when you notice that this game is hollow. The world is hollow, the NPCs are hollow, the progression is hollow, the tech tree is shallow, the crafting is just awful - don't get me started on the stupid anvil and recipes nightmare. There aren't any milestones to work towards or sense of raison d'être.  The only enjoyable and redeeming aspect of this game is the pleasant *THUNK* sound your truck makes when it runs over a villager; but even that wasn't worth the entry fee.",1671588773,1671589604,False,3,0,0.49804455041885376,0,True,False,False

Edit: It has been two years since the game has come out, and it is still receiving a lot of major updates! This game has been so much fun, and there is always new stuff coming out to make it even better!

Edit: Once again, yet another update. And the game now has... FARMING?!?!? Some might wonder why there is farming in a game about prospecting, but I am honestly more in love with the game than I have ever been. Not only can you plant and water crops, harvest and sell them or make them into soup, but you can automate the farming, and there are now npcs! You can make bowls of soup from the crops and give them to npcs that request them. Eventually, maybe there will be more types of quests, and who knows what else will be added to the game!

On previous updates they also added fishing, which is simple but also fun, and of course as with everything else in the game, it can be automated, so you can find unique ways to gather tons of fish!",1589256940,1671331754,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

If your idea of a fun Friday night is watching paint dry while a goat licks the skin off of your feet, then the farming update is definitely going to be your thing. In theory you can automate farming. In practice one sprinkler costs 2100 farming tokens. You can exchange tomatoes for those, so you only have to grow roughly 1400 tomatoes. From stalks that you have to water by hand every 2 minutes. And you'd best water them from the right angle or else the water just bounces right off of them. You can expect to do that for around 30 minutes before one stalk matures and creates between 1-3 tomatoes. That you then cook into a soup, which you deliver to an NPC.

Nothing to do if you automate everything and there is no end goal. Only tutorial you have is a youtube video. You can also build a house, but you wont even need it.

If you have enough coins to buy a land, guess what, you need to either dig minimum 14 blocks to get water in one land plot. There is also a land plot you have to level the shit out of it so that plot can be even close to usable.

The developers put out monthly updates to keep players in the loop as they anticipate update and as far as I can see, every update has done an incredible job at upgrading the players experience and giving the players more reason to come back.

-What this game does-
Currently it is an amazing combination of mining, blacksmithing, fishing, and farming. This game plops you into a wonderful world (Now filled with NPC's from the farming update) and gives you nothing but a brush, two sift pans, a map, and a shovel. Yes that sounds awful, back breaking labor and doing everything manually but this will only happen if you let it as when you start digging away and finally making some money you get to upgrade your muscle powered factory and use the power of water to finally let yourself sit down and relax. May as well pick up fishing to make an extra buck as your hydro powered machines churn away the earth and spit out precious resources.

This game has a great sense or relaxation as you quietly become the richest man in the village. Everything will start slow with you only making a few hundred at a time but it just gets faster and faster as you improve on your automation.

-Tips for new players-
Fish can be cooked and be sold for a higher price rather than raw. There's no indication when the meat is perfectly cooked but the meat will darken as it cooks and if you leave it too long you can burn the meat and ruin your fishes value. I do hope a cooking system can be properly implemented. Maybe something like how Sea of Thieves does it? 

The deeper you dig, the better the resources.

If any pesky NPC's get in your home demanding soup and refusing to leave your property just pause, save and go to menu, and load back in and all should be fixed.

-Current bugs at the time of this review-
[strike]If you happen to be carrying around a cart while looking at an NPC, do not hit the pick up key (Default is E) when looking at them as you will forfeit your cart to the soup loving NPC but your character movement will still act as though you are holding a cart. Thankfully there is a simple fix and that's just: Pause, Save and go to menu, and load back in. Hopefully after that your player should be normal and your cart with its possessions will be next to the NPC.[/strike]

I play a few games like this and this one offers a lot of what the others offer but at a much lower price.  At $10 you just can't go wrong.  The devs are still adding things to the game, not as dlcs or xpacks but just as part of the game for free.  The game start is a little slow at first but it gives you more than one path to make money.  You don't want to dig with a shovel?  Fish!  I found fishing is faster to make that start up money to buy an automated mining operation.  But you can dig and gold pan to get chunks of ore to start out too.  There is no real end game.  The game will pretty much go on forever.  I haven't found a way to die yet so it is just a game to let you build what you want and then watch your creation work.

Edit
The farming stuff is alright but the second currency is lame.  Why am I making a whole new currency to build farming stuff?  Get rid of the second stupid currency.  Because of the second currency I have no intention of farming anymore.  I don't have to farm to stay alive or to buy mining equipment so why do I need to do it?  I will stick to mining and fishing.

While the lack of a UI and simple control scheme is rather charming and totally fine, there are certain things that absolutely leave you scratching your head. With the tutorial video it's actually really easy to pick up, but there has still been countless times I've had to look something up or check the control settings because a tool tip isn't as helpful as one would hope. 

There feels like so much to do in your journey toward truly automating! and while I adore the time spent getting there and there is something really satisfying about doing things by hand, but it still feels like there are massive quality of life options missing. Like why is it that a game that encourages digging big ol holes (and outright requires massive holes in places like Mildew's Aquifer) still have digging be the most tedious and time consuming task possible? There are also no ladders so the only way out of a hole of your own creation is an awkward concrete staircase, or the good ol' ""unstuck"" option in the esc menu. 

Setting items down or watering plants are just a constant fight with the physics engine, and trying to place build items is it's own special battle every time. Especially when the ground I've painstakingly leveled out keeps rising over and over again. It's also a little silly that certain containers will only carry certain items, and anything else will just phase through it. Also water filters are the actual worst, as they break easy, and shut off the water when they do, bringing the entire line to a complete and utter stop. The benefit they provide is VASTLY outweighed by the tedium of running out of repair kits every five seconds because they break CONSTANTLY. Take em off and repair your machines when they break, I promise you it's a time saver. 

And even with all this said... I want to keep playing. It scratches an itch that a lot of those base building/automation games cant quite. Everything is so hands on, it lights up that part of my brain that wants to make mud castles and sort through shiny rocks. The Devs clearly have a lot of love for what they're doing and it shows.

For the price, you can argue there's a lot of game(time, the game loop is pretty simplistic) for the money, but this game feels early access at best, not a second major iteration.

The concept is fun, some of the mechanics leave a lot to be desired, such as the buying system, even with using the cart or truck within the shop. I've heard second hand from the community that the dev is trying to avoid putting any sort of hud in to the game and while this is an understandable desire, it shouldn't be at the detriment of the game. Mods help with some of this and I can only hope they're brought into vanilla at some point. 

The game inspires you to build big, but what ever part of the game it is, can not handle big; with clogs being a main gripe, but also once you get to a certain size, even loading the game becomes a challenge.

I'd love to recommend this game and at the price I almost feel like I should, but with the current state of the game(I never played pre-2.0) this feels more like a beta or early access game.

[edit] v2.1
I put a few more hours into this game and I'm starting to believe this is just another rage game in disguise; like why the hell is my combine harvester drifting away from the belts as I'm emptying it and why do I need to continuously hold down a button to empty? I continue to believe the dev makes bad design choices for the sake of aesthetics, when the control and inventory systems need a massive overhaul. I could go on for much longer about the issues with this game that the dev just turns a blind eye to. This game should be one of those in the relaxing category for awards, but the flaws just make it a blood boiler!",1654345420,1670753405,False,5,0,0.573309183120727539,0,True,False,False

Something I really came to appreciate was how everything in this world must be carried, organized, or processed as an object right in front of you.  There's no inventory slots, no pockets to stuff things into.  So everything you build and every coin you earn comes from something you painstakingly carried around in your hands.  I haven't played another game like this!

Playing before the 2.1 update, I was all alone in a bizarre countryside where local commerce was run by a syndicate of autonomous buckets.  It was then that I learned every lesson on my tiny starting plot, carving and shaping every trench, running to fix broken machines, and watching my wealth grow in proportion to my knowledge and steady technological advancement.  But nothing really told me how to do this and the sense of incremental discovery felt benevolent and playful.

After the 2.1 update, this lonely world became overrun with beautiful, talkative NPCs who fit right in with the character of this world.  I see carrot seeds sitting on the shop bench, and a chef's knife on the table, and a stove for cooking pots.  I know I'll have to earn every drop of that soup myself, and somehow it's a satisfying adventure.

It's a good game with more content coming.  Maybe it will draw you in too.

More features are being implemented pretty regularly, and there are still a lot of pretty bad bugs. I've played early access games that felt more feature complete than this game. All of my gripes with this game would go away if it was just labeled ""early access,"" but they pushed not only the final release, but now they're on 2.1.  I started playing in 2.0, so you'd think it's pretty feature complete, but no, they're still adding/changing things.  Now my 2.0 save wont even load on 2.1, so I have to start over from scratch in a game I played 50+ hours.  That's an oof.  This isn't the first time I've had issues with saves either. About halfway into my last save it just stopped loading and I had to try a whole bunch of things to revert my saves.  It only keeps one previous save state so if your mistake was within the last autosave window, you're still screwed. 

The game still has a long way to go.  It calculates physics for every single object in the world that is in motion. This includes dirt clumps, so once you get a fairly decent mine going, the game just goes at a crawl. Unreal has tricks they could use to lower the physics overhead, but they are focusing on other areas.  This is something that should have been fixed before main release. Imagine if Satisfactory crashed because you built 50 machines? Meanwhile I have satisfactory saves with thousands of machines, but this game sputters with 50-60 machines on a $4000 computer. Yeah, ok. 

This game definitely has promise, but as it sits right now, it's definitely playing like early access. I guess I'll check back in a year or so like I did with No Man's Sky.",1670686326,1670686326,False,9,2,0.531590044498443604,5,True,False,False

Obviously rough around the edges as it is not in it's final release state yet.

Game receives periodic large scale quality of life updates, and the devs are always adding new items/mechanics

In it's current state I would 100% recommend to anyone who enjoys resource focused sandboxes.
For most other players, possibly hold off for future updates simply due to the unfinished nature of the game (some aspects can get a little frustrating if you don't really care to put in the effort).

Edit: Ok, a Dev response deserves more than a short snarky review from me.

I really liked the idea of Hydroneer but the gameplay killed it for me.

The first five minutes of the game I was starting out learning the controls and doing the dig and brush routine when I either stepped on one of the tools and next thing I know I'm going mach 10 for the stars and end up splashing down on the other side of the island.{I know how Jeb feels in KSP now.} I thought the whole thing was hilarious but I had to restart because I had no idea how to get back to the start. (The whole 5 minutes of playtime thing.)

So I restarted and got into the whole dig and scrub thing for the next fifteen minutes or so. It was almost zen like. Then I decided to go sell my pan of sparkling nuggets... And then the new guy moment happened. I emptied the pan. Think it just dropped them nuggets in a neat pile? Nope. Looked like I bazooka barfed nuggets all over the claim. Spent more time picking up nuggets than I spent digging them out. (One of those situations where if it happened to someone else you would laugh your butt off.)

Spent the next sevenish hours randomly repeating variations or combinations of the first two events....  You know it's time to uninstall and call it a day when your left with a twitching eyelid from aggravation.",1670289774,1670372322,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Controls are so annoying and clunky. You can't pick up more than one item, if you want to start out digging you need do extremely tedious ""grab shovel -> dig dirt -> place dirt in bucket"" then its ""drop shovel -> pick up water bucket -> throw it in river so it fills up with water (cause you cant scoop for some reason) -> pick up the water bucket -> throw contents in dirt bucket -> throw away bucket -> grab brush -> use brush on dirt/water bucket -> throw away brush -> grab ore

You see how tedious this is? You also cannot pick up more than one item, so you have to grab one ore at a time instead of just picking up multiple ores in an inventory. Holy cow this game makes watching paint dry more enjoyable.

No direction or guidance from the first second, even in the youtube comments of the tutorial video people are astonished why you need a shovel from X place to start playing.

Maybe it gets a lot better when you can automate stuff later, but damn after 20 minutes of play I have no interest in pursuing something with such ridiculous controls. Oh, and you cant even put down buckets to align on the ground. You just ""drop"" them and 9 out of 10 times it falls on the side so you keep picking up and trying to drop it so it lands on its bottom. And even putting small ores in a bucket goes wrong majority of the times because for some reason the mouse pointer is NOT the area where it's gonna fall, instead you gotta wing it where it might land.

Don't unstuck your car, then unstuck yourself while holding a shovel.  You'll get stuck PERMANANTLY inside your car and you can't drive the car because you're holding a shovel effectively softlocking your game.

It's such a painful task to dig down and set up machined below ground.  You need a ""Magical"" single layer of dirt to mine, you can't just mine off the bedrock for ""God knows why,"" so you're left having to take a shovel and putting a uneven and awful looking layer of dirt to put machines on.  

This game got a lot of hype from some creators but I'm not starting to think they were paid to make a bad product look good...as is the way of capitalism. We continue to get fed nonsense by people willing to take money to do so and end up with unfinished and lackluster products.  As this slowly becomes the mainstream players are forced to lower their standards because none of them are smart enough to band together and make change happen and, not to mention, how they're constantly fed that organizing and making things happen doesn't work (It does, you're just stupid)

Pros: 
- Great foundtation to expand on with game mechanics and ideas (long term)

Cons (General):
- You can dig dirt and place it in the world, but the world doesnt care. Meaning that you can create infinitly long Dirt sausages in the air that ignore Physics in a game where it apears that physics should be relevant... (this is my biggest complain)

- Controlls feel off. You pick up stuff and drop it somewhere to the right. You get a circle to where you gonna drop something but ... why? Why dont you drop stuff in fron of you? I can only assume you need this offset for later but i never reached that point. The offset feels bad.
- With the shovel you can put 4 Dirt into the Bucket or 1 Dirt into the Pan. If you have 4 Dirt in the Bucket u can put this Dirt into the Pan. This is the only way to get 4 Dirts into the Pan. Why ? If you try to put 4 Dirts into the Pan with the Shovel, it wont let you, your limit becomes 1...  why cant i put 4 Dirt with the shovel in the pan ??
- You pick up water with the bucket by throwing it into the water ... this is a minor complain but cmon.
- Driving from the Castle down over the bridge with speed ALWAYS stops your car and bumps it in the air.

Other Cons:
- I can melt Iron and Gold, i can not melt Coins. Why cant i do this? I would love to experiment...
- Water in a bucket on a Furnance stays water.. this is a missed oportunity.",1669550386,1669550386,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

Although truth be told there are so many quality of life problems with this game that I'm tending more towards not recommending. Granted this is a small time dev, so everything with a grain of salt. 

If you think this is primarily a building game (like satisfactory but water power + mining), boy do I have to burst that bubble. This is much more like a simulation of the most inconvenient grocery shopping experience you could have. Imagine this, you're going to the grocery store to pick up your things. Bad news is you can only carry one thing at a time, which means you're carrying your coins into the store to buy. That's right, no coin storage for you! Just lug your pile around and try not to forget it anywhere. 

Next you have to load your items 1 at a time into the pay area. So walking back and forth with each item, just to pay. So 10 trips for 10 items to the checkout. THEN you also have to load your vehicle. So 10 trips just for those items you bought +1 for your money pile. The game does have a pallet you can buy to put items on, but guess what, items can't be gently placed onto the pallet, nor do they like to be stacked onto each other, so you're dealing with one layer high items that tend to bounce, or roll away when you try to place them. It's a huge pain in the butt. 

The best part is that because this is a building game you need A LOT of different parts and pieces. And you'll be spending most of your time packing and unpacking them. The actual building, the mining, the crafting, all of it takes a back seat to the nightmare that it is to get the goods. 

While I haven't played on creative mode, to my knowledge you can just create the parts you need and totally circumvent the hassle, but frankly for me I've always found creative modes to feel like cheating, and it takes the fun out of the game. 

Now you might think, surely the mining is worth it, surely you're actually getting true progressive rewards that pay off and make you feel like you've accomplished something other than wasted your time at the nightmare grocery store. Nope. There are 8 different resources at the time of writing this, and 5 different things you can craft. The only thing that changes with your mining depth is your % of finding them. All of them can be found in the starting claim. There is nothing flashy to discover, no big reward for crafting, no useful crafted items (like repair tools). 

Speaking of repairing, guess what your main purchases will be late game? Repair items. Things break all the time and I think this is meant to be the money sink for the game currently. The huge drawback for this is that it completely prevents true automation. At the same time with how things are set up when you're playing the story/regular mode do you really want to invest the time and tedium into trying to make an semi automated system that you have to babysit? Things like this make me question why have story mode, are we supposed to feel this much pain while playing?

I played over 20 hours trying to squeeze some true fun out of the game, trying to lessen the stress that normal mode brought. I thought that maybe the game would get better, so I progressed until I had one of the better claims, dug to the lowest point, and set up my mining op. Trade off with that was distance to the store, which was already set up to be highly punitive. One thing the game tells you is that if you dig deeper the rewards will be better, which yes technically your % chance of finding the resources increase, but you're not actually getting better rewards. Just more of the same. 

This game adds more stress than relaxation (currently). There isn't a lot to do, there isn't a lot to achieve at all. The game itself is lonely, there are no NPCs, no quests, no life, with the towns literally having lights on but no one home. Waiting for NPCs. 

Overall I have to say things feel unbalanced and very rough and somehow very small. The game forces you to play a certain way by limiting your access to mining equipment (which isn't too difficult to unlock, but it's all very very tedious and time sucking). Maybe I've been spoiled by other crafting/building type games. It's very limiting right now on the building/crafting/exploring/mining, and your main task is literally getting the things to actually build with, in an obtuse manner. And then babysitting your creations. 

After 20+ hours of investment I personally think that some amount of actual accomplishment is warranted, or just a lessening of the pain/stress. Maybe this game will change for the better, right now the core of it needs work. 

If you like Satisfactory you're going to be disappointed, look elsewhere. As the game is currently, I wouldn't buy full price. At the time of posting, it does look like the game is often updated and still getting things improved. Maybe by next year my review will change.

It has nice, intuitive controls, a refreshing take on item management (no inventory) and a fitting, kind-of-cozy art-style. Even the bugs you will encounter add to its charm/personality.


Once the multiplayer update drops, I'm confident I'll buy it for a friend or two just so I can play some more!


UPDATE: I am loving the small QoL updates (and the creative mode). Devs keep you updated, entertained and looking forward to the 2.0 update!

Your objective is to dig for iron, gold, gems, shards and cloutium to turn into jewelry, weapons and other sellables and make money out of it. This money is then spent on buying tools, machinery, vehicles, building materials, etc. to expand your operations.

[h1]Full Review[/h1]

You start off with nothing but a basic shovel, a brush and some pans for dirt and water: the classic gold digging method. You have to constantly shovel dirt in your pan, add water and scrub for the goodies. This is no way to make some good coin! So what do you do? You forge your found iron and gold into a sword and a ring and sell them at the jeweler in town. You bring a visit to the local equipment shop and buy a couple of pipes. You then install these pipes at the river so that you no longer have to scoop water into your pan: you can just put it under a tap. This allows you to scrub for resources much more quickly. 

Let this form of progress set the tone for the game: you constantly expand your operations with new machinery and improved logistics that make your base a little better each time, turning manual labour into machine works, allowing you to focus on more things. The equipment and machinery available is moderately rich in variety, such as automatic drills, conveyor belts, pipe systems, housing items, power and Logic (the game's electronics). Especially the latter, the power and Logic system, albeit simple, has quite an arrangement of powerful options that can both improve your current setup as well as build impressive new setups.

What's interesting about this game is that there's no inventory system. Everything (absolutely everything) has to be carried from A to B manually. Of course, you do have logistic tools to help you out in that such as tractors, pallets and carts, but you still have to load those by hand. This is both a breath of fresh air and a curse. It makes building your base and transporting more items to it feel more rewarding but at a certain point in time, especially when you have serious cash to flash, it can become tedious and feel like wasted time.

On items, because of the nature of the game, collision is an issue. Items that touch the world or other items in a weird way have the tendency to be shot away at high speed, glitch through objects or in other ways disappear. I've had several items fly away and I haven't yet found them back. This is especially frustrating when it happens to a valuable item (small tip: be careful with crafting battleaxes!).

One of the more major shortcomings of this game I find, is the exponential increase in your wealth. You start off incredibly poor, struggling even for basic items and equipment and having to do a lot of manual labour, and then suddenly the switch flips and you're a millionaire with a completely automatic digging, refining, sorting and smelting process to boot. After reaching that point of wealth (which comes sooner than you realize), the motivation to keep improving my base began to wane. You could argue that if you simply like the game, you'd keep building regardless of that, but for me personally I want to feel like what I do is worth it in the form of a reward, e.g. a really expensive piece of machinery or something else to look forward to, to [b]build[/b] towards.

The game's optimization has some issues when it comes to how long the game is running. It normally runs pretty smooth but every half hour till an hour, I find myself reloading the save because the FPS dropped to something like 30-40 FPS while I have a pretty powerful PC (that is with graphics set to low and resource saving to off). It's a mild nuisance.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

For an eight euro game, this is a little gem, good for a couple dozen hours, if not more. The devs are active, their Discord server is helpful, mods are supported and more content is coming, multiplayer included! The game's content/price ratio is very good and the future looks promising. It has some flaws, but they're not game-breaking and will most likely be ironed out in the future.

If you like building games, especially in the style of Factorio and Satisfactory, this game will most likely strike your interests.",1622290040,1669149392,True,41,2,0.790543794631958008,0,True,False,False

Podria decir que me gustaria que hubiera personaje femenino... pero lo van a poner, podria quejarme del cubo de pesca.... pero lo van a poner asi que no hay quejas .

At the time of writing this, there's plans for the ""2.1 Update"" which includes farming, but this I'm writing this from my own playtime experience.

Hydroneer is a novel little time that I got me a few good hours of entertainment, but darn if that novelty doesn't wear off quickly. It didn't take me long to graduate from ""shovel dirt into a bucket and make it wet to get money"" to ""build some machines to pump out resources automatically."" After that, the game feels more like a matter of upkeep, with that sparkling novelty chipping off as you grow your operation.

I made a basic setup with a machine for automatically pulling from the ground, which deposited the dirt into a machine that automatically refined that dirt into ore/gems, which spit it out into a machine that automatically sifted out the gold, and then a machine that automatically sifted out the iron, and deposited them both into their own buckets for smelting. Once I had my little setup operational, I realized that there wasn't a whole lot to be done. I'd used the mechanics to make an automated moneymaking farm and I would reap thousands of coins per hour with little worthwhile to spend it on.

The physics are too unpredictable for this game to feel good about upscaling, like Factorio, and there's not enough depth to the game to make building your fortune worthwhile. You can certainly spend hours getting a system to make you buckets of money much faster... and you can join me in an otherwise-empty world, without anything to spend your money on, and without anything to progress towads.

Like I said, it's got some good bones at it's core, but Hydroneer is desperately lacking depth in every aspect. It feels like a proof of concept rather than a game, but maybe I'm just asking too much from it.",1668029016,1668029016,False,42,1,0.693428575992584229,0,True,False,False

I know there were other items and things to do in the past that have been removed in order to streamline and better the gameplay, but now there's just not much to do once you get your drills setup.  There are a few easter eggs, but not much more in gameplay terms.  It should probably be in early access.  There are more things coming down the pipeline.  Farming and some other things are supposed to be coming later in the year.  Automation is tricky and very limited.  I don't mind the trickiness, I just wish there were more parts I could mess with and try to figure out more interesting things to do.  There are only two tiers of drills at this point, and only five products that you make, that you sell all in the same place, basically.  There's six plots of land to mine, 3 ore types, four gem types, and shards.  It's simple.  I wish there was something bigger that I was working toward.  Something that all the money I started bringing in with the drills would become useful toward.  More things to craft and expand upon.  Once your at tier 2 drills, that's basically the only thing you make, other one of the five products on occasion if you run low on money.

When picking up items and objects you aim with the reticle in the center of the screen but when dropping an item or object you need to aim with the shadow of the object instead.  This makes doing anything in game down right impossible in low light areas or at night time.

Optimisation is decent, graphics are good, physics are a mere suggestion, which makes for some fun interactions with what would usually be an inanimate objects, especially when you get into automation and items decide to stack into a single spot for no reason in particular, simple application of magnet on a stick may reduce framerate a little in this situation.

I'm having fun with it, it's weird not having any kind of inventory and having to keep track of where you left all your tools and many piles of coins. 
My solution was to eventually just leave huge piles of coins at every stores purchase bucket.
As for the tools, I'm starting to just purchase lots of tool racks and lots of tools to just leave everywhere I'm going to use them.

Whilst I absolutely recommend this game, you may want to steer clear if you don't like the grind (and/or don't like to use mods that make things a bit easier and might make it feel like ""cheating"", the ""golden pan"" mod was a good way to get things started a little quicker and remove the early game grinding slog for me).",1666175513,1666175661,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 - Trying to tip stuff from one place to another and watching them scatter everywhere, involves picking things up individually
 - Trying to put stuff by hand in to a crucible and watching them scatter everywhere
 - Trying to pick things up using the magnet on a stick, a tool designed to solve a game problem of stuff scattering everywhere, then trying to drop them into something and watching them scatter everywhere
 - Trying to combine money by dropping them onto each other and watching one of the chunks of money bounce off the other chunk of money and roll down the hill
 - Trying to use the handsorter only to find that the outlets throw the resources at slightly different speeds so there's no easy way of catching them in a pan or crucible, so you end up doing the pick them up individually, or the magnet on a stick
 - The magnet on a stick being better at yanking things out of a container than putting them
 - Dropping stuff onto the anvil to do crafting and watching them bounce off, especially rubies (**** rubies)
 - Watching my funnels being only marginally better at putting materials where they have to be than simply having conveyors or machines launch them, which (as you guessed) involves picking up the material by hand

In addition it's plagued with a number of poor design decisions, beyond the terrible physics, progress is effectively measured using your bank balance, and almost everything in is acquirable by spending money, this leads to an interesting problem that to acquire nearly anything you are presented with 2 choices, build something of scale, spend a lot of time crafting, and therefore fighting with the games wonky systems, or not play the game and let it run in the background. Arguably the most effective way to play the game would be for you buy the tier 1 tools and simply conveyor everything into the back of a cart or truck and then come back 2 days later and sell it at the jewellers, so instead of tackling this poor design decision negative systems, such as the tools breaking exist, which prevents you from just letting the game run by itself, and therefore forcing you to be at the keyboard at all times, because if you're not your whole operation may just shut down.
The resources themselves are also utterly irrelevant beyond their financial value, while the game seems keen to encourage you to dig deeper it gives you not genuine incentive to do so, as the resources themselves don't mean anything except a financial value, so why would you bother, you will be able to buy that next item with every you can acquire from the surface, it may take a little longer, but it's not really a significant difference.

As a whole I really really wanted to love this game, it's exactly the sort of game I usually enjoy, problem is you spend so much time tidying up after the various machines and there isn't really any genuine progression within the game I've firmly bounced off it, which I find a little sad.",1665936338,1665938439,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The world is empty and lifeless - no NPCs, no wildlife, only some seemingly abandoned buildings for the player to interact with. The island to play on is fairly small and limited compared to what you would expect from an open world game. There is no health, no survival mechanics of any kind, I dropped myself from a mountain to see what would happen, and the only thing that happened is I immediately got stuck behind a few boulders. Good thing there is the ""unstuck"" option in the menu.
The main mechanic of the game consists of a minimal interface without any inventory - you can only hold and use one item at a time and all items have to be stored and moved around by dropping them in the game world itself. This means that to fill a bucket with dirt and water and then ""wash"" the contents for valuables you are constantly shifting between items - always dropping something to pick up the next item that you need. While the fact that all items in the game are always physical objects in the game world is an interesting concept, the way it is implemented, only ever being able to hold one item at a time feels too constricting and too much like an annoying gimmick than really adding anything to the game. It's also a bit of an immersion breaker. Humans have two hands, and belts and backpacks are real things.
I'm sorry to say that I lost interest after just 20 minutes. But I see the game is in active development. I might check back later at some point to see if it has become more interesting.",1665695915,1665878488,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

To enjoy the slow, painful grind of the shovel and bucket to slowly get machines to automate... my roommate is worried about me, but he plays LOL so I don't care. but the satisfaction ends at some point.

See, I have to agree that it stops having sense and being rewarding. For me it was the moment of disappointment after of all that time, grind, and resources to set up  2 tier machinery  only to find out it is essentially not worth it. I would have thought that for all that hassle tier 2 machinery would at least break less frequently. And even further I made the mistake of thinking it would be awesome to prepare a new parcel, nuke excavated to the bottom, with enough pipe network to power hundreds of those 2 tier mofos BEFORE testing them... 

The dream of building  a very large factory with 50 miners to automate your richness, is completely shattered when you realize you'd be spending sooooo much time fixing machines getting broken. I didn't have that much of a big factory and I'd have to go grab a cart, buy 20 bags of repairing tools, toss them near the machines and go to other parcel, spend 17 minutes there knowing that in 14 minutes I'd have to go back and repair the machines that were funding the next project and then go away another 14 minutes.

God is just not worth it, I didn't even get to try to build a pretty house or a big castle, I was so frustrated.

Anyways, so far so good, I like the concept, I like the potential it has, I like the enjoyment of pouring 8000 ore of gold into one ring to sell it to the only person that would fit it (your mama) and hipefully the vehicles come back.

It has a very cartoon-like look combined with some realism and detail, kind of like the Borderlands games, or somewhat similar to how Roblox looks in some instances, but on steroids. I also like to think of this game as a very simplified version of Satisfactory too. I am looking forward to the upcoming farming update, but I am mostly excited for the new Gem Compressor machine. The main reason why is because I have noticed that when running the mining equipment for hours at a time and repairing the water filters every 20 minutes or so (I know I can buy logic wrench dispensers and logic durability detectors to remove the need to frequently repair, I just haven't been able to do so yet), gems will over time clog up between the end of the conveyor belt sorter and the edge of the Gem Compressor, greatly restricting and/or completely block the continuous flow of gems. I have dealt with this issue in the past by using the magnet on a stick to drag all the clogged gems into the compressor (My current starter location setup has one compressor for each gem type), however, there is normally so many gems that the game will lag big time for a few seconds when moving all of the freed gems. Not only that, only a portion of the gems make it to the compressor and the rest splash everywhere in all directions. It ends up being a big mess to clean up every time, but it's worth it. I really hope this will be resolved with the new Gem Compressor, but in the meantime I will try adding a straight conveyor between each conveyor sorter and Gem Compressor and metal/tin sheets around each Gem Compressor and see if that helps with my personal issue. I am also hoping that once the Tier 3 Update comes out, there will be a Tier 3 Drill, Harvester, and Tier 3 tools as well at the very least. Last but not least, I have a suggestion for the developers out there that I would like to be at least heard or considered since other players may or may not want this to be a feature in the game as well. If this hasn't been done already, *PLEASE* tweak or add an additional option in multiplayer capability that allows players to have ""true"" cooperative online multiplayer. This means please somehow make it possible for players to play this game with 1 or more friends without being forced to have split screen on both ends and have 1 player only able to use a keyboard and the other player only able to use a controller. It would be *AMAZING* if two or more people could play this game together online, have the whole screen visible for all players, and have more than 1 player able to use a keyboard or controller. When I bought this game, I also bought it for a few of my friends, thinking this would already be implemented since there was a Cooperative Play Icon and Multiplayer Icon on the game's page in the Steam Library. This was not the case when my friends and I tried playing this together. I know that this is wishful thinking, but if this could be a reality by at least Update 2.5 or sooner, that would be awesome. Additional music/more songs in the game would be great as well, but I'm not as worried about that being added or considered.",1665097466,1665110646,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've introduced it to a good few of my friends and they've had varied reactions to it, seemingly based on their temperaments as gamers. Mostly their reactions are positive, but I think their outlook highlights something for me: just like with a lot of things, this game isn't for everyone.
Hydroneer is great to me, because I enjoy slow and very involved progression. It gives me something to focus on and look forward to. In the best way it is something I can get lost in and enjoy being a part of. You place every component that is a part of your mining equipment and every wall or floor that is a part of your base. If you're not playing in creative mode then you will also be saving up money you've earned to buy those pieces as well. 
Sometimes the 'survival' mode can be a little tedious, but that is why I reached a point of pride and accomplishment in that mode and then moved to a creative world to enjoy the building aspect even more.
I don't usually write reviews for games. However, I feel compelled to do it in this case, because I feel there is something great here. I think the team behind this game is doing an excellent job and they are really involved and care for this. It deserves to be recognized.

Positives:
* core game loop is fun / concept is good
* coop
* relatively bug free

Questionable:
Theme - it's ok but not used well. Why arn't i dwarven? I could easily have some goals for setting up a new dwarven underground mining town, checkpoints/achievements based on how big it is or something. 

Start of game:
* could really use an in game tutorial

getting the hang of it:
* quite good, construction components, game functions well

mid:
* the game has a 'tier 2' that is functionally the same as tier 1.. doesnt serve much purpose except to be more expensive, this doesnt matter though, because you earn so much from the previous level that the cost of all items is irrelevant (poorly balanced progression)

* progressing to a second plot is unneccessary because you already have all the money you need

* money has no purpose except for purchasing more machines and vanity items

* a lot of the game is spent fetching items from stores. the whole game is physical, so not sure how this will get fixed. (carrying money around is even a pain)

* digging becomes a chore since there's only hand tools or explosives, no real progression here that works nicely

Motivation and Drive:
* the game runs dry quickly because there's no purpose. you're not doing missions, your not trying to get money for some purpose etc etc. Until this is changed, i don't see it being considered a good construction game.",1663470638,1664930040,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I’ve played complex games, complicated games, simple games, difficult games, and everything in between.

Hydroneer is vague and pointless. And I’ve played Minecraft. 

The developer had the great humor to put one of your starting tools not with the others, leaving you stuck scratching your head until you get lucky and stumble across it or watch the ‘tutorial’ - a YouTube video. Not even a few popup boxes and in-game arrows, no, you’re just sent to YouTube.

After that, you are given no more information beyond vague and unhelpful item descriptions. Figuring out how things work isn’t overly difficult, just tedious.

Speaking of tedious, let’s talk about gameplay. Grab the shovel and dig a chunk of dirt, put it in the pan. Drop the shovel and pick up the pan. Put the pan in the water- actually drop it, not use it, or you will dump out the dirt. Pick up the brush, use the brush on the pan. Drop the brush, pick up whatever nugget you got out of the pan, put it in either the bucket or the wagon. Repeat about 150 times to get the chance to figure out how to assemble the automation machines.

And what are you doing all this for? Nothing. There is no goal. With Factorio, you’re trying to leave. With Satisfactory, you’re trying to complete the tiers. Dyson Sphere Project has you trying to build the ritual Dyson Sphere. Hydroneer has no goal. Do work, get paid, do more work.

Maybe in 5 years it will be worth the time to play it. Not right now.",1664821086,1664821086,False,1,0,0.453320920467376709,0,True,False,False

The ""no ui"" approach to the design is a bit quircky but the end result is that it feels like a port of a VR title and it generally makes simple tasks kinda tedious once the initial novelty has worn off.

The main objective of the game is to mine materials out of the ground and sell them to buy equipment to mine more materials. The trouble is that after the initial hurdle of earning eanough money for the 2 machines you need to automated mining you very quickly end up in a situation where there isnt really anything more to work toward. Basic automation very quickly gives you eanough cash flow to buy whatever you want, but there really isnt any next goal to work toward other than just building more miners to get more money to... well hoard in a corner somewhere i suppose.",1664702097,1664702097,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is great! That 6.2 hours is from my first session alone. It takes a lot to keep me entertained for that time. At it's present form it's very good. There is a LOT missing and it shows, but you're not penalized for it in game. Everything that's available can be used and I've seen no slow down in play because of what it's lacking at this point. 

It's a very empty world with an eerie feel to it because you feel the isolation when in the town areas. Most of the city areas are unusable and don't have anything to interact with at present however everything you need at the moment is available at the starting area. 

The fishing is also clunky as hell. Casting is pretty cool but the bobber dipping for a bit is clunkish and reeling in is just an instant click. there's no fight to it, no reel animation. It just a click and the rod flicks then a fish drops in front of you.

With all that being said, I highly recommend this game. For $10 you're definitely not getting hurt. In it's present form I wouldn't pay any more than $15 if the price raises at any point however I'd assume if the price increases then there's probably a good update.

The gameplay is about learning to understand the wonky controls and physics, the basic loop of both panning and crafting materials, and why fishing is for some reason ludicrously better on rate than doing any of that (seriously, it's wild how much more you can make fishing versus engaging the game where its at).  I held off on the fishing because, well, that's boring as hell, did not wiki, and found the economy and discovery of the game to be slow but tolerable.

After you get in the hang of the repetitive motions of Hydroneers manual labor you can start scraping by enough money to start making things.  The things are all for making things less annoying.  Lights and camp beds so you can start to get a handle on how long and unpleasant the nights are, pickaxes to make digging less miserable, granite blocks to undo the mess you made digging, and water pipes so you don't have to toss your bucket into the river, crafting items to make your cart rides less frequent as you improve the quality per density of your pile of items.   Eventually you will have enough quality advantages to make enough money to start purchasing automation through water piping and, assumably, end your troubles so you can start having a little fun exploring the post game.

But here's the thing: there is no such thing as total automation.  Products can only get to the ore stage off of treadmills and still have to be manually smelted into their end state amulets or swords (or, more likely, sold in a messy pile of unfinished ore).  Machines break without filtered water, and water filters break over time (rapidly, from what i've seen) for no reason other than that they're water filters.  Which means that regardless of what you do, you will have to load carts full of material to sell to the merchants to purchase disposable tool bags to manually repair machines that you assembled to stop from having to do a job.  And that's a job.

I feel like the end goal of automation games in general is to get to a state where you can stop working on one thing and start playing around with another, until there's nothing left or you feel inclined to walk away.  In this game, the end state is that you have enough money that you don't have to pay attention to the awful machines you've built and can let them fall to ruin around you until you run out of money again.  That's not a good feel.  

Hydroneer feels *different*, which I applaud in any game, but it also feels tedious and unrewarding.  At a glance I'd say it needs faster loops, more engagement with the automation, and more balanced and varied routes to wealth.  There's a lot of repetitive action here for no good reason, and while solving some of the games obtuseness is a reasonable puzzle, it's not a strong enough experience that I'd give it a full recommend.",1664235218,1664235218,False,34,6,0.573560893535614014,0,True,False,False

From Not Recommended to Recommended.
There's been a lot of updates and patches and fixes. They are on top of it :-) and that has made it to a really good game in a short period.

Pro: For the price it is it's worth it. But:
Buying and transporting items is way too elaborate.
The main issue I have is that you cannot setup a clean system; boulders and bits will go all over the place and it'll become a lagfest.
Funnels they clog up or dont dampen horizontal movement of small objects enough to make sure they cleanly go into the next item in the cell below. For example a funnel above a pulverizer.
Still lacking in content as well.
Some items don't pass water through in the direction needed so you'll end up setting up elaborate turns and twists (buying and transporting more items which is not really fun - see first line).",1603790681,1664199447,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Similar to Satisfactory your end goal is to mostly if not fully automate the process, but unlike Satisfactory you aim isn't to produce more and more advanced machinery. Instead you are aiming to gather Gold, Iron, and various Gems to refine and sell to eventually own the entire mining community and be able to build what ever you please. Of course you are not limited to this goal and can instead go on side tangents for your own amusement. For a good example of this I suggest looking up Lets Game It Out on Youtube and watching his video gameplay's as he does many things, but mining is rarely one of them.

I've bought/invested in a bunch of smaller indie games over the years and Hydroneer is by far one of the most fun and technically best investment I made. The dedication Max and many of the active members of the community to make this game truly an amazing gaming experience is really inspiring.  It is definitely not easy to make an enjoyable experience when there's no obvious inventory mechanic in the game, however, Max being the ingenuitive developer he is has shown us that it is possible to spin what would otherwise be seen as annoying from a game-design perspective into a pretty simple (and even relaxing) system.

Honestly, I cannot wait to see what amazing stuff Max, the community developpers/contributors, as well as the modding community have in store for this game in the future!

Id like to share my thoughts on it.. 

the game is amazing, sometimes, some things can be a bit wonky but ultimately im having an amazing time playing. It was slow at first to start off with a shovel pan and a bucket, but as you start to grow and get into automation, you start to understand more. once you have more money , then you start to see the games true potential. 

i havent had issues with lag , or bugs

looks clean and runs smoothly, and my favorite part is to watch all the ores be separated by smelters and sorters

pros: there is workshop content.

the game is updates alot, and he keeps adding fun things to the game.

you have to make your machines in ICEHEIM now and cant survive solely on money alone.

the trucks are  a GODSEND, OMG, if you have alot of materials to travel with, use the truck. youll thank me later.

CONS; repairing drills and everything else that breaks is a real drag and causes issues. an easy fix for this is to go to the workshop and turn off durability damage and the game is 10x more fun and gives you more time to explore and let your machines run and make money, but it renders the toolbox useless (whatever, they are cool looking paperweights) XD

another con: the truck gets STUCK under lightposts, i would raise the street lanterns a bit so the truck doesnt get stuck.

you will spend a good portion of the time building and planning, make sure there is water near you and happy mining!

-Getting stuck on/in the stupidest of things (really small holes, and even my bucket). And when I mean 'stuck', it froze my controls. Can't even jump.
-The 'goofy' physics engine, when dropping items like buckets. I lost count how many times the bucket didn't want to drop on its bottom (even when the terrain was level).
-No ingame tutorial, which is quite shocking for an Early Access game. Didn't expect to be dropped in and have to figure things out on my own.
-When filling up the small bucket and if I accidentally dug again, the game won't allow me to drop the shovel. Had to go up to the river for the game to finally let me drop it.

But it also has what I feel is a more in-depth mining mechanic, as well as the ability to almost fully automate the mining and processing aspect.
Start out small, filling buckets with dirt and washing them out with the pan and brush to obtain lumps of iron, gold, gems and power shards (more on those later). Sell the ores and gems for coins which you can use to buy better equipment. Such as a forge, crucible and ingot cast to melt the ores down into bars which are easier to manage. Or invest in a grindstone to cut and polish your gems, increasing their value. Or combine it all with an anvil and hammer, creating weapons and jewelry to sell.
Once you get tired of manually digging all the dirt, start investing in drills, processors and semi-automated crucibles. All powered by water. But be careful, if you don't filter the water, it will damage the machines quickly. Is the machinery going too slow? Not enough water pressure? That's where the power shards come in. Use them to power pressure tanks to keep your water pressure high.
There are also several tiers of mining machines, each tier being faster and more efficient. Once you have completely mined out the first area, you can even buy other mining locations to increase your profits.
Bored of mining? Go buy a fishing rod and fish any of the multiple streams or even the main river. If you catch special fish, you can even obtain higher tier fishing rods.
Even though it's a relatively small indie developer (The initial game was made by one guy), they are constantly updating and adding new content. Highly recommended, 10/10 iron pipes.

Progression based factory games have always been a love of mine since before they were even a genre (to my knowledge first thing that comes close is minecraft redstone automations).

What starts off as a tedious manual operation quickly evolves into large scale production facilities which can and will bog a computer down when done inefficiently. It has some optimization problems, especially when carting around large quantities of building materials in a truck but the game is still relatively new and devs are obviously very actively working towards making the game better all the time.

Where things fall off for me (and this is my problem, less about game design) is my ability to figure out how the logic circuits work. I've tried on several occasions to figure it out but I just can't get a timer/stop start function to work with it. Like i said though , this is way more to due with my ability to understand the system in place and less about the games options to make it happen. I know that it's possible because I've seen videos proving it but I am just not smart (or familiar) enough to figure out how to do it myself.

Either way I hope they expand the logic system options to make them more ... umm, stupid person friendly :P But I'll still play it again when tier 3 equipment is eventually unlocked too. I would love it if the multi-player wasn't a split screen, I don't know if that's always going to be like that or if it's just a stop-gap until true multi-player is added. I hope it's the ladder since there are people I'd love to play this with but they won't because it's not how they want to play.

The concept is great, the idea of having no internal inventory is an interesting concept and while it can be tedious it makes for an interesting game mechanic to work around in my opinion. I say that but I'm also hoping for some kind of delivery system to get added for tier 3 as an endgame system.",1663362198,1663362198,True,7,0,0.608507633209228516,0,True,False,False

- I go back to the main menu, see a tutorial button, and click it; a youtube video opens in my browser. Thankfully I have a second monitor to notice it. Watch the first minute or so to figure out any shred of context possible.
- Finally find the shovel and bumble around with my controller for a bit until I figure out the controls. I start putting dirt in the cart, thinking that's what it's for. Watch more of the tutorial, realize it goes in bucket. Try putting multiple dirt piles in bucket, can't do that. Eventually I figure out the process going back and fourth.
- After about 25 minutes I get a bunch of ore and gems and such, in the most tedious back and fourth process of dropping and picking up items possible. I thankfully noticed a map and try to orient myself, and go to somewhere that I guess is a shop according to the map? (if there were any signs or markers I didn't see any) I see a bucket in front of a building on the ground with a big sign a few feet over it that says SELL in big capital letters with a bright red button under it. It's getting dark out (""why is there a daynight cycle?""), but I can just barely see the gems I picked up. I put them in the bucket on the ground. I repeatedly press X on the button. Nothing happens. I look at the video again. Apparently I was supposed to put them in my OWN bucket on the TABLE a few feet next to the sign that is over the bucket on the ground.
- I run all the way back, pick up my bucket, and move the ore into my own bucket on the table. The sign has a little # indicator that changes to 65. I press X repeatedly on my controller on the red button. Still nothing happens. I try clicking my mouse. It works. I wonder for a moment, try one more ore piece, and try my right trigger. It works. Every other interaction so far had used the X button, but now suddenly I use the right trigger?
That was the point I quit the game. Saw the top comment on Youtube asking for in-game tutorials rather than a video, saw some top recent reviews also mentioning confusion, and realized that the rest of the game was probably going to be the same ongoing struggle to figure out how to do anything.

In UX/HCC terms, minimalism does not mean having little to no UI elements with little to no guidance for the player. It means putting the least cognitive/memory load on the user so that they can figure things out as swiftly and painlessly as possible. Slapping a video on Youtube that assumes default keyboard controls so you can have a ""minimalist"" UI and drop the player into a random world with no context or anything definitely favors the former rather than the latter. For example, when Satisfactory drops you into the world (literally), a voice gives you some basic tutorial-esque ""objectives. You don't necessarily have to do them right away, as they are moreso to teach you the main mechanics. As you progress, they go away. (Also, hovering over interactable objects shows the buttons you need to press, 100% of the time) It's not too hand-holdy, but it still gives you context to your surroundings and introduces you to the basic game loop and game progression, and leaves you to discover more advanced mechanics on your own.
If this game really rethought its onboarding process and had more helpful tooltips (i.e. ones that explained item usage in better detail with the player's set input for it and was in proximity to the item rather than shoved in a small text box in the lower left corner), I'd consider it again. But as is, I just do not have the time nor patience to sift through guides and videos to learn basic mechanics. I apologize for how lengthy this is but I felt context is key here. I'm sure there's probably a mechanically sound game in here, especially if you learn well from and have time for player guides and videos.

There are sound reasons why builder games like this have inventories, concise UIs, aim to reduce idle cycles. Hydroneer has none of these. I had to carry a lot of stuff back and forth because of the lack of inventory and the challenges of operating the vehicles (when I don't clip against a fence or a goddamn lamppost).

My high point came when I decided to dig a pipe to an underwater aquifer, and the fact it took several days and the end result was a shitty flow of pressure shows that there are reasons consolations are made for a lot of games like this. We have no lift stations to maximize pressure, the process involves the worst excesses of constant traversal, and I stopped having fun long ago.

Also, the environment is pretty samey. See, a lot of the areas in the map are copy pasted, whole ridges, forests, so its kind of confusing. I think this game is giving me a legitimate panic attack.

Solid pass.

But I feel the game isn't finished yet. Stuff that is in place works well, but it really misses a tutorial where it tells you how to do some basic things (fueling the car, selling items, digging (I spent hours with a shovel just to find out the pickaxe is so much more effective without having to move dirt around!!) tier 1/2 items and what the difference is, safes for items without there being anyone to steal it, etc). Part of the fun was just roaming around and figuring this stuff though. The world is empty and feels empty, you're there by yourself and alone, some random stores and homes, but nobody there.

Then some bugs. Most prominent: Resources can get stuck. Especially when the ""dirt to resource"" - machine breaks down. Dirt piles up in front of it and gets stuck. If you don't pay attention this builds up, turning the FPS to a crawl. Using the magnet on a stick on this pile gets it loose, but the game will freeze for a while. Anyhow, this happens too wit gold/iron, seems to randomly get stuck (splitter belt -> funnel). The ""remove all unprocessed resources"" button fixes this too, but it just seems wasteful, especially early game.
And then later game (20+ hours) it turns out there is nothing to dig tier 3, so don't waste time nuking the place like I did...

Looking past these few things, it is an amazing game that got me hooked just like satisfactory and factorio were able to do.  What I like better than satisfactory is that it is so simple, just a few machines that do it all, nothing complicated. Simply dig, smelt, sell, buy more stuff to dig and build more.

I like the look of the game, the artstyle fits perfectly and I like the ""low poly"" look, though the only gripe I have in regards to that is the terrain, it's too smooth.

And I like how there is a natural flow of progression; panning for nuggets then smelting/refining them for more value, then automating the mining before eventually automating everything with enough time spent at each ""stage"", at least at this stage of the game. (note: I think power shards should be slightly rarer)

I do have some suggestions in regards to pacing in some areas.
1. The amount of power shards needed in pressure tanks should increase depending on how far from the pump it is, maybe with the minimum value being bigger than one.

2. Thee cost of each miner and harvester you get should increase to avoid making it exponentially easier to get more after the first forging.
2.1 Maybe as an alternative, or as well as, the forge itself could have an ""efficiency"" modifier starting at 100%, decreasing each forge.
To top this number back up you would have to provide resources to the forge itself, not a set value maybe, but what you need could depend on how far from 100%, with each repair increasing thee cost by a percentage, maybe an extra 10% per repair. (Example, the first repair would need 100% resources, say 10 iron for 10%, then after 10 repairs the cost is 200%, so 20 iron for 10% etc etc)

3. As I said above, to me there seems to bee a natural progression, so maybe the game progression could be centered around that?
I'm thinking you only have the castle and jewellers next to Ember Cradle at first and fund/unlock smelting/cutting there.
Then the shop down the hill opens (after funding someone who wants your help setting up shop, maybe with both money and materials) and you have access to *some* of what you can currently get at first. (maybe have a hand operated waterpump and hand filter?)

4. Power shards are only useful once you got machinery, so maybe you have to find a way to research the properties of power shards to unlock items that use them. (and maybe more items should use them, maybe as a sort of fuel?)

5. I think weight should play a bigger part in how you handle and carry items. IE 
I do have suggestions for thee controls as well.
1. The pick up/put down actions should be a short press of thee E key.
2. Using items should be changed to have a long press of the left mouse button, (this includes entering/exiting the use of all vehicles)
3. Buckets and pans should have an alt action: Right click should scoop water or items up
4. Ditch the tank controls of handcarts, please.",1662559848,1662559848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pro:
 - Nice Devs! Thanks Grandma Max for this game!
 - Good Pricing and no ****** microtransactions (and all the other stuff straight from marketing-hell)
 - Good Update-Behaviour with really well-written updates - not only new stuff, but also improving old Stuff and refactoring Code for better performance
 - easy building-system
 - Workshop with mods!

Con:
 - you can easily get a small Mining-Operation which gets you a million Hydrocoins or more in less than half an hour - after that, you can buy everything
 - Tier2-Drills are worthless at the current state - you can easily build a huge Tier1-Drill-Operation which is 10 times cheaper and has a higher Coins-for-Value-Ratio - so it's not worth upgrading
 - Difference between different Mining-Spots doesn't feel great - you build a small Mining-Sorting-Rig in your first, wait a bit and sell just the bars for enough money to buy the biggest and priciest spot on the map

Expect absolutely no help from no one. Save from a (self-named) ""Short-video tutorial"", you have no NPCs, no signs, no in-game helpers. I get that this is supposed to keep the immersion, but note to the developers: a barely-better-than-minecraft-graphic-set is NOT immersive. It's FRUSTRATING. 

Grind. A lot.
 Every action in this game requires a ton of repeating, boring, non intuitive, barely controllable-moves.
You first order of the game is to sell stuff, so you can upgrade your material. How? 
First: Search for the shovel. It's THERE, next to the lamppost, outside your view. Found it? Great. 
Follow these steps:
Pick it up (press E). Dig (click), face the bucket (mouse), drop in the bucket (click),  face the dirt (mouse), repeat. Three times. 
Now, pick the bucket (E. not click), empty it's contents in the pan (click). Oh, did you miss that? Is it because the pointer that marks where it drops is different from the mouse marker? Too bad. Pick the dirt up, place it (click) in the pan. You remembered to fill it with water before all that, right? 

... RIght, After you did all that, and went to the unmarked town, and found out it had no signs of the JEWELRY you were supposed to sell your two ores to (yeah, three buckets for two ores. Horray), go to the next town, and sell your hard, back breaking work for... 34 units of currency. Which gives you  enough money to... nothing, really. Carry on.

To summarize: Controls are non intuitive, the grinding is repetitive and exhausting.",1662168262,1662168262,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

A lot of the other indie games like this feel like they are running on the same engine, with the same awkward issues. This game really feels more at home in its engine, like things work well.

Something about placement just seems much more smooth than other 3D building games. A big part of that is that the game is much closer to doing placement correctly than most. The only non frustrating way to place objects in 3D is for them to float at a fixed distance from the player, and to be able to adjust that distance by scrolling as you are placing. This game at least does the first part instead of the common, and incredibly painful to use, snap to ground.

One of my favourite bits is the lack of inventory. It feels sort of awkward at first, but having to stack stuff to move it around never stops being amusing. Plus the way containers have sticky surfaces that pick up objects in contact with them just feels really smooth. In general moving items around feels like a game, rather than a chore.

Also it is incredible how much less frustrating it is to build things when you can do a bit of terraforming. Like in satisfactory I would build huge ugly platforms in the sky so that my buildings didn't clip into the ground all the time.

[h1]Suggestions[/h1]

The game does have some cons though, it is a bit unfinished feeling and there are some fairly big problems, especially with the in game economy, that may frustrate you for a bit.
[list]
  [*] Being able to stack materials into bars infinitely trivialises factory design. I can just separate the resources into their own smelters and then just sit around and wait for them to build up. If the bars had a max size I would have to build something much more complex and interesting to handle them.
  [*] The game doesn't have great money sinks. Once you have 10 or so level one drills going you are going to struggle to spend money faster than you are making it. However you will still be struggling to get enough materials for the level 2 drills. For example the land plots could all be 10-100x their current prices without issue.
  [*] The currently available upgrades could be more significant. It is disappointing that the level 2 pickaxe isn't even better, it can just dig deeper. Similarly the level 2 drills don't seem to produce enough more stuff to justify the expense(and don't produce any new resources).
  [*] The stock market isn't worth the effort if I'm only going to get 15% more. I would say that a 50% gain is probably the floor for what I would drive around in search of.
  [*] The player character could move faster. Given that there is already a mechanic where when moving more items you generally move slower, increasing sprint speed a bunch would have few balance consequences and make the game more enjoyable.
  [*] Non-diggable terrain could be more obvious. Right now it is very visually similar to the level one terrain so it is easy to not notice until it is too late.
  [*] The magnet on a stick would be much less frustrating to use if it behaved more like a real magnet and attraction dropped off with 1/d^2 like a real magnet. Currently when I try to use it to fix clogs it makes a mess of the surrounding area. Hopefully such a change would mean that at the point where moving too quickly causes items to be dropped, they would still be on screen rather than trailing a bit outside of it.
  [*] The roof on the conveyor shop is infuriating when I'm trying to stack items for purchase. As if you jump you can't drop items because they are clipped through the roof.
  [*] Falling through the grate next to the masterwork anvil feels like a bug.
  [*] With the way the cars handle being able to drift with the handbrake would be a lot of fun. Already every once in a while I manage to bounce in a sharp turn and it loses traction and does a sort of drift and it feels great.

Mining can get REAAAAAALLLLLY slow after a while and after about 2 days I just ended up modding the game. 

Suggestions:

1. add some NPC's even if they don't do much... seeing the whole world empty just feels wrong with this kind of aesthetic. But maybe that's just me.

2. shrink the size of the car or add a new vehicle in general, I can't tell you how many times I've driven that thing off the bridge or just slammed into anything that's just barely close to the paths and gotten stuck cause of it.

3. Reduce the rarity of the cloutium... sheesh its so slow getting that ore. 

4. put a tutorial, so many things I had to look up because it's not explained at all, like refilling the car's water tank.

5. more things to craft.. rinse and repeat comes QUICK. 

6. be able to purchase more than one item at a time.

7. Oh and please just make a wallet for your money so you don't have to carry it.. everywhere.. It's so silly and pointless.

Here's the basic initial loop for getting resources:
1) Press 'E' to pick up the shovel
2) Left-click on dirt to fill the shovel
3) Left-click on the bucket to fill 1/4 of the bucket
4) Repeat 4 times to fill the bucket
5) Press 'E' to drop the shovel
6) Press 'E' to pick up the bucket
7) Carefully position the bucket over the pan
8) Left-click to dump the bucket into the pan
9) Press 'E' to drop the bucket
10) Press 'E' to grab the brush
11) Left-click on the pan to clean the dirt

You now have a few pieces of iron, gold, or a shard.

You can only carry one item, because there's no inventory system.
To move multiple items you have to pick each one up separately, and plunk it in a pan. 

So to earn ~300 units of money, you have to repeat that whole tedious process a number of times.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But, it gets better. You're only able to do that after a figuring out awkward interactions that aren't explained. For example...

To put water in a pan, you fill a bucket. To fill a bucket you don't click on the water with the bucket, you have to physically submerge the bucket by throwing it in, or submerge yourself while holding it. And then you don't click on the pan with the bucket of water, you have to pour the water in. 

But then when filling a bucket with dirt, you click on the dirt with the shovel to fill the shovel, then click on the bucket to fill the bucket with dirt. You don't pour it in. But then you do pour the bucket of dirt into the pan.

So, initially, you're constantly confusing the controls because similar actions require different input, and it's never explained, and doesn't make much sense anyway.

Most of your initial time is adjusting to a control scheme that seems to have been defined to purposefully defy modern control schemes that were developed by years of figuring out what made the most sense.  

As you do it, you have to constantly strafe and turn to look around and make minor adjustments and find small dropped things or re-mine or re-water, and it even started to make me physically sick because it's so unnecessarily repetitive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, stop and think ""Why did I just read all that? It's so dumb.""
It is. It is dumb. It's poorly designed. And just...not fun. It's so bad it's hard to explain. And your motivation in the game is not ""Hey, this is fun!"", it's ""Ugh, I hope I can make this less awful.""

For a small development team, this is a great effort. It will need a bunch of work before it is ready. This should have been early access. I will check again in a year if the developer has not abandoned it.

Updated review

I put another 10 hours into the game, which has improved dramatically. Unfortunately, this game is not for me. I would recommend this game for the idea of it if you can get past how tedious the building and interface are, how difficult the game is to navigate, and the little in-game help.

It feels rough around the edges, but can be quite immersive and relaxing. You start out with a shovel and a pan, then move up to building an automated system all running on hydro power. It's worth trying if you like those kinds of games, although you'll need to be a bit forgiving. It's a very slow start and there's no inventory system, including for money - which means you have to pick up and move everything by hand, and you can't carry your money and the thing you just bought at the same time. If you do put a few hours into it, it's satisfying to see automation coming together, but there's no end game.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Relaxing background music
- Satisfying mining, once you get the hang of it
- Landscaping system
- Robust 3D building system (minus the bug mentioned below)
- Conveyor/automated mining systems
- The minimalist interface is annoying, but it is immersive and unusual

[b]Cons[/b]
- Going to town to buy things is tedious. Especially given that you have to pick up each item drop it in the cart, pay for it, pick it up, drop it in the truck, drive home, pick it up, carry the item and place them all individually.
- I was hoping to discover that there were multiple kinds of ores (other than just iron and gold), or new things you could create and sell. Unfortunately it looks like everything you find in the first digging area is everything in the game. New shops don't open, no new items to build.
- I really get the feeling that it should be made for VR - it would be perfect with the whole ""no inventory"" system and simplistic art style. Unfortunately not.
- Even once I got flat concrete surfaces, items often fall over instead of standing upright when you drop them
- No in-game tutorial or intro. There's a 3 minute video - but other than that you're entirely on your own
- No achievements, which might have given some goals for what to do
- It's kinda weird that everything in the game looks medieval, but you start with a modern day diesel truck. It would have been better to stick with just the wooden cart
- The towns feel really empty with no people in them. Buildings are closed. Who am I selling this stuff to? Even if there were just NPC models that didn't talk, it'd help make it feel more alive
- No inventory system at all. It's a nice idea in principle, and it does add a sense of immersion, but it becomes annoying really quickly. For example, you have no pockets so you have to carry your coin stack in your hands. You also can't pick up more than one object at a time.
- I built a water pipe system, and no water came out the end. I removed and re-built each piece one by one, then it worked. Makes me think the underlying systems are rather buggy",1620759208,1661266043,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The general gameplay revolves around mining ore and gems and selling the result to the local jeweler. You do this by shoveling dirt from a land plot into a bucket, emptying the bucket into a washing pan and then adding water to the washing pan so you can brush the ore free from dirt.
The deeper you dig, the more valuable the result you get. There are mutliple types of ores you can find, basic iron ore which is the most common, gold ore, which is precious and worth a lot of money, energy shards, which can be used to power machines and several types of gems that are extremely valuable but also rare. There is also cloutium, which is more worth than gold but a lot more rare and is also used for some crafting recipes.

There is no limit on how much ore you can collect but eventually your framerate will suffer if you fill your pan too much. A common trait of the pan (and most items that serve as inventory space) is that objects ""stick"" to it unless you empty it with a command, which means you don't have to fear that your ressources fly out, even if the pan or the bucket would turn over. This is especially helpful since there is no traditional inventory in the game, so you cannot shove the ore in your pocket or something like that. 
The game aims for a more immersive type of gameplay, no inventory and all objetcs in the game interact directly with the game world. This makes the game somewhat fiddly to play, you have to pick up items one at a time, sort your ore by hand and cannot hold more than one object at the time. Once you get used to it, you won't mind it however.
Since all the objects are interactable inside the game world as they are, you can use buckets and pans or literally anything you find as makeshift containers. Some items are designed to work as inventory and allow you to put infinite amounts of stuff into them. 
After selling a good amount of ore at the jeweler you can use the money (which, again, you have to pick up manually, no pockets for that either) to buy additional equipment. A good investment early is to buy a furnace, a crucible and a mold. With these three items you can start smelting your ore and create ingots which are worth more money and on a plus side, also easier to carry.
There is no limit how much ore you can smelt into a single bar and the more ore you use, the bigger the ingot you get. The value of an iron bar is usally that of the used ore plus a bonus. 
But instead of selling your bars you can also craft them into equipment, which is worth even more money. But for that you need to buy an anvil and a forge hammer.
Step by step you build up a basic equipment and create more expensive products for selling. From gold and gems you can create expensive jewelry. Gems come in different tiers and differ in value with onyx being the most expensive.

At some point you want to invest into automated mining because that constant digging and brushing takes too much time and is not much fun in the long run. This is where machines come into play. You can buy harvesters, convesers and drills. Drills dig out dirt for you, harvesters convert dirt into resources while conveyours are simply used to transport stuff between those two. You can also buy sorters that will sort your resources for you.
With a good automated setup you can soon roll in money. However, if you want to get really deep into automating, you have to craft those machines yourself. You get only a limited selection of what you can buy, the best stuff is aviable at Helheim, a big underground forge. There you can use your iron bars for crafting more machines and if you use cloutium, you get really good equipment.

One thing I didn't mention before is how power works in this game. The name ""Hydroneer"" was chosen for a reason, the game uses a water based power system. To use machines you need to build a pump and then connect the pump with pipes to your machines. Every machine in this game needs water and even your car uses water as fuel. You can further boost power with energy shards or smelt those into bars for even more power output.

Besides mining there is also fishing and the developers announced they will also introduce farming to the game at some point. The main gameplay will however always be the mining and it clearly is the best part of the game.",1660846945,1660846945,True,34,1,0.779804527759552002,0,True,False,False

When I first started playing this game I was impressed by the mechanics and how picking up and dropping things was really unique and pretty flawless in comparison to other games with similar abilities (like skyrim for example, oof).

It felt like a pretty straight forward game: mine to sell to buy to mine more to sell more to buy more and repeat. That seemed relaxing and enjoyable to play. The setting sun and having to use external light sources to see at night was about the only real struggle or danger the game possessed. It was a game I could see myself getting hyper focused on and lost on for hours. I liked the simplicity...

And then I realized that simplicity was in fact boring and machines can make more money more quickly than I can without actually losing dirt. And that lead me down a rabbit hole of trying to do the best too quickly and thanks to Reddit and some YouTuber I was able to come up with a pretty elaborate design on the first dig site within a week of playing this game.

However learning that came with the realization how terrible this game can actually be and what more struggles lied ahead. That wouldn't be such a downfall if it was just *learning* how the game and each item in the game works. I mean, that's the fun part! Instead it was ""how to avoid this bug and that glitch and why tf is my game lagging all of a sudden??"" *Exasperated sigh*

That's not fun. Trying to avoid bugs and glitches and telling the game to delete every resource/dirt block to avoid lagging is stressful and not that intriguing. While also wondering why some setups work, exactly how the description says, and some don't even if it makes sense to. Even Reddit is dumbfounded at some of the contraptions that work and don't work. Some things work in ways you'd think they wouldn't or shouldn't work. It's complicated for a pretty simple game. Too many things in a movable item, like a pan, bucket, the wagon, or truck, makes the game lag too and the truck freak out when you try to drive it.

However, I gotta give this game some points. Its a cheap game made by a very small team of six people- like that's impressive. And to run as smooth as it does, even with all the bugs... it's a hard game not to like. I just wish they would fix some things and add some items that are better than their precursor (like better water filters). And maybe add an interactive tutorial instead of a guy in a youtube video? That'd be nice. Also the remove all raw resources and dirt blocks have helped me tremendously on more than a couple occasions. So at least they're aware of that problem.

As much as this game annoys the ever living shit outta me, I don't hate this game and would still give it a recommendation. I think I got my $10 worth of play out of it and would probably definitely continue making elaborate designs if these bugs were fixed.",1659671138,1660809959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's an ingenious distillation of simulated economics, writ grassroots in value per ounce rather than count and tho the machines serve a very singular purpose, getting a fully-optimized build running glitch-free does hit you with that jolt of serotonin that can only come from that perfect illusion of having done some manual videogame labor [i]right[/i], with your own two unblemished nerd hands.

But straight dope, there's nothing here beyond that. Virtually zilch. You mine the ores, you make the weps, you sell the weps, you make the coin, you buy the parts and you buff your machines so you can AAAAYYYYYYYY mine more ores. For why? Who knows! You can check out the surrounding map, (and what a charmingly alt-medieval aesthetic it is!) but it's not randomized so exploration is very limited, there's no NPCs and all the buildings are empty - so no quests/jobs/missions for you to see to. And if it were just the typically Early Access concession of participating in a slowly evolving something while enjoying what content there is in a developing state, that'd be fine. But Hydroneer is literally all just the base tech, sitting beneath a tantalizing promise of one hell of a clever sandbox game and nothing more (that and this game is no longer in EA.) The motivation wall is a mother of a revelation and when you hit it, it hits like $10 worth of wind just got knocked out of ya.

Catch 22: Clearly, you want to support a dev and see a promising idea come to fruition, but if you wanna know how much content is there to be found, well, now you know. Even against other long-gestating sandbox stuff like Scrap Mechanic, Volcanoids, etc. Hydroneer is really friggin bare.

Also, if a pan is on top of another pan, it will fly, so that is how i got flung across the entire map by picking up a pan. This last one takes the whole wedding cake.

-Tons of freedom in automation, from logic components to simple conveyors. 

-Multi-tier progression, going from Manual mining --> Tier 1 drills --> Tier 2 drills, each requiring different setups. 

-The textures fit the gameplay nicely, the textures don't try to be overly realistic.

-It's relaxing, setting up your own mining factory is nice.

What sucks about the game: 
-The item placing system is extremely inconsistent, sometimes you can place stuff inside walls, other times a speck of dirt is blocking you from placing.

When I came back to the store page to write the review, I totally forgot how cheap Hydroneer actually is, for the content you get I would be happy to pay more than twice that!

I have had so much fun in Hydroneer, there's already a hundred different ways to play the game and the Devs add updates very regularly! The crafting and mining is incredibly satisfying, the world is beautiful and the Fishing is so much fun too! Not to mention you can use your profits to build your own house, or huge automated machines!

I can easily say this game can be played by every type of player, no matter what you like to do. Love mining and making lots of profit? Absolutely. Love building huge and complicated machines? Or houses where you can display that huge shark you caught? You really have no limits in this game. They're even adding farming!

The Devs are absolutely amazing people too, they really interact with their community (If you haven't seen the bridge made out of a million fish in Hydroneer on youtube, you really should!) and they listen too: they recently added an update filled with user suggestions, and add them to their own updates too! We'll soon have more character customisation options (for us ladies) which i'm very excited about! 

Technical performance: I have a pretty old computer and it still runs like a dream (GTX 960, 16GB RAM, Intel Core i5-4690K CPU @ 3.50GHz, 4 Core) . if you start having issues with frames after amassing a mountain of iron and gold, you can easily smelt them, squish gems together and they retain their combined value. Very well put together! Driving can be a bit chaotic, but they make it super easy to reset the vehicle and the chaos is a part of the fun, for me! You won't lose anything in the trucks no matter how badly you drive!

Lastly, I really want to thank Foulball Hangover for making such a wonderful game and a flourishing community! <3",1659954021,1659954021,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love it !!!
I was kinda ready for all down-sides of it ....mostly

Today i tried it for the first time ...V 2.0 i guess ...
There are so many issues with the game - seems that the maker has no idea what he's doing ! or not able to fix it coz it ...""might"" relate to the framework he used ...do not know 
because issues from previous version persist in the v2 !
Especially - item placement !!  or release  

I'm still at the first steps of the game - there are lots of bugs i saw in videos ....- which i'm still have to face !

in anyway - game is very entertaining !!!!
I would still  suggest it for other to play ...but only people with nerves comparable to the Chuck Norris
or these who gets paid for doing that

It's a quite good factory building game where you mine through dirt for metals and gems to make weapons and jevlery for sale.
That's the shortest jist of it. It isn't like Factorio or Mindustry, your only goal in Hydroneer is making things for sale and optimizing your factory-mine for peak excavation.

But, there are a few buts that might break it for you:
1. game has excidingly slow start. At first you are doing everything manualy and since game allows you to only hold one item and you do not have an inventory the first metal extraction will be just you shoveling dirt into a bucket and then putting it in another bucket to sift through it for goodies. 
This plain and simple means that your start before you have even the smallest automation will take an hour (if you are not using mods to skip this part)
2. the previously mentioned one held item limit. Yes, there are items that allow you  to bypass the limit- like carts, trucks and a wooden pallet- but most of these items slow your movement, obscure your view and are overall quite large objects making them hard to put down if you are working underground.
3. Underground- the deeper you go the better the resources, but the digging system without mods is tidious and usually requires long polishing of the cave you made before you can put the machinery down, and even then it tends to happen that machinery is too big for a cave you dug up.
4 The system for building is still quite buggy- the collisions for objects you place down, like pipes and machinery, is a really annoying process if you missed even a smidge of dirt or you are too close to where you place the object. Sometimes the collissions even detect your character, especially if you wear a mining helmet
5. The machinery tends to get excidingly convoluted due to ""One operation per part"" rule the game is based on. This means that you will have long pipes, convoluted cables and huge assemblies even if you strive for perfection and optimization

The game iteslf seems to still be in development, even outside of the early access, and it indeed came the long way, but it still has  a way to go with more of the glaring issues- mainly the collission system and the tidiousness of starting",1659620255,1659620255,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
