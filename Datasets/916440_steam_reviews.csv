After 60 hours, i think its safe to say this is hands down one of the BEST city builders of all time.

The Good
1. Its optimized so it can run on most pc's
2. LOADS of content and lots of things to keep track of
3. Looks beautiful and can even beautify islands
4. Easy to learn and to understand
5. Can be incredibly difficult as well as incredibly easy 
6. Can play multiplayer with a friend and even go to war with them for fun
7. Can command a navel fleet and dominate the entire world 
8. Can buy dlc to increase the amount of content but i promise you lol you wont need it right away

After 4 hours of playing, I AM BOOOOOOORED. Its just staring at a screen waiting for your eco to balance while wading through lag and repeated escort and fetch quests. The ""Exploration to the new world"" is super boring and just a ton of ""WhAt Do YOu Do?!"". Dude Id play a point and click adventure if I wanted to point and click to find out what happens next. I want to see what's happening, explore and find new islands. It takes so long to do anything I have no idea if I'm just doing it wrong or if the game is just trying to simulate a slog because I cannot for the life of me find out what I'm supposed to do next. I repeatedly place the same building down to stabilize my eco because it only makes 1 every friggin blue moon with no means to upgrade or make the production faster than occasional fetch quests that I have no intention or want to do. If you're going to make missions and quests heavily effect your relationships with NPCs, please for the love of god make them actually FUN!!!!

I do not like having to place repeated buildings to get my economy to build quickly. I want to upgrade or add modules to existing buildings and expand an actual industrial zone, not just ""Hee hoo another brick factory go here""

When you get to ""The New World"" its basically just more resource points, nothing else. You can't even build half the tech you unlock by going there, in the new world. Its ridiculous lmfao. How is this game so popular? Its so limited and so expensive for modern day. Why aren't we looking for new features in games anymore? Why are we just ""okay"" with the same thing released over and over again with a new coat of paint. Its just beyond me I guess.

Only way to get military power: Build more ships, ships however are LAGGY and the more you have in one spot the laggier it is. Makes it near impossible to keep up with enemies as you're again, fighting and balancing lag and fun vs. actually winning and surviving.

Other than that, the game is super fun to play and has a lot of thought put into it. But I can't support an expensive, buggy, and laggy game for its price, with the amount of DLC it has.

The premise of the game has largely stayed the same: You start on an island and build a city, build supply chains, fulfill the citizens needs and then upgrade the residences to reveal more needs. Not all the islands have all the required resources so eventually you have to expand to another island. If that sounds repetitive then... well it can be. Then again, there is a LOT more going on:

Anno 1800 is beautiful, stunningly so. Zoomed out you see lush forests, glistening water and big mountains. Zoomed in you can see an incredible amount of detail, to the point where you can actually see your population at work and walking around. There's even a first person view that let you see the detail up close. The only criticism I have is the grid to which everything has to built - this does make everything look a tad less convincing.

The gameplay is largely as described above. Anno 1800 is a city builder/ supply chain simulator/ real time strategy game. The RTS element focuses exclusively on naval combat. Combat isn't something that the series has ever done amazingly well but it's adequate. But to even get to that part, you have to build ships and while simple sailing ships aren't that complicated, getting to the late game Battle Cruiser is a different story entirely, let alone the airships that you get with one of the DLCs but more on that later. To get that far, you not only have to get the most out of the resources in the region but also other regions... which you first have to discover.

Needless to say, the game does get pretty complex. To make it somewhat easier, there is a campaign mode that acts as something of a tutorial and has a reasonable story to go with it. It doesn't really go far enough though and leaves the player in a open-ended sandbox type game with only the basics having been explained. What makes up for this a little is the flexibility in starting a new game: You can play a creative game (a god-mode type thing) and a sandbox game. The sandbox is totally customizeable - you can choose difficulty level, how many AI competitors (including zero AI), how difficult they are, how large the islands are etc. Then there's also scenarios which change some of the game-rules and rewards you with unique items that you can use in regular games, some of which are just cosmetic while others can be a huge bonus. The UI is another thing that the tutorial could do a little better at. The UI itself is great but the game is complex and understanding the UI and how it can help should have been given more importance.

With all that complexity, it's certainly legitimate to ask if you should consider making it even more so by adding DLCs, particularly given the price. The way you are introduced to the content in a new game is gradual. Some have new regions and much like the second region included in the base game, you have to make an expedition to get new areas (these are basically small text-based adventures) and you get to decide when to do so. I have all of them aside from the cosmetic ones and that was right for me, if you're unsure then they are occasionally on sale with a good discount. If you are going to get just one, the Sunken Treasures DLC might be the best as it gives you a new region with a HUGE island, albeit with no new resources.

While it has its flaws, Anno 1800 is great if you want to sink your teeth into a complex city builder with loads of content. If you're prepared to learn as you play or to look at the odd You Tube tutorial, you'll have a game that will keep you going for dozen of hours. If that's not what you're looking for in a video game or if combat is a big factor then it's perhaps not the game for you.",1708461790,1708461790,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After giving my review a day or two of thought, I've changed my mind and wanted to recommend Anno 1800. While there are some things that I find tedious/annoying, there is a ton of content here, even with only the basic game. While I do find the $59.99 price tag a bit too high, the game is a steal when it's on sale for $15. 

Considering I've already logged 170 hours in the game, it's already paid for itself many times over. The campaign was just long enough to have me approaching the late social class tiers, but there was still a lot for me to accomplish. I started a new run after campaign, having learned a bit more mechanics and whatnot in the campaign mode. 

The new world music is awesome, there is a certain level of quality and care in this game that makes it appealing. The graphics are pretty, and the sound (such as the individual building crating a particular product, like iron, or the ships of the line in combat) is immersive. I'm 40 years old, I've played tons of video games and one thing that I'm particularly critical over in a game is the music, and this music does not disappoint. 

I was initially bitter over the pricing of the DLCs, and in some ways I do agree with another poster here that said that ""buying the entire game"" (i.e., all DLCs) is over $200 USD. But, as previously mentioned, there is a TON of content here, I've barely scratched the surface of the New World Rising DLC and there is so much more that it's hard for me to complain. I want to buy all the cosmetic packs too.

I hope they put these items on sale more frequently, because I want to buy them all (or almost all), but it's hard for me to fork out $200 all at once on DLCs.

Some things that I dislike:

- The Ubisoft launcher/software that you've probably already read people complaining about. It's not a huge deal for me, but yeah, I don't like it and I also do not feel that it's necessary.
- Really long epileptic seizure warning during start up (maybe due to my hardware?)
- Game can feel very grindy/monotonous at times. I've found the best solution here is to just step away from the game for a while. It's like Minecraft to me in that regard, once I tire of the simple things, I know it's time to step away from the game for a while, then when I come back, I find I enjoy the simple things again.
- The AI can get quite annoying buying up your property. My advice is to save up enough money to start buying their islands. Once you take most of the map, you can finish off their last remaining islands. And if you buy portions of their islands, this will assist in preventing them from continuing to buy up your islands.
- Too much emphasis on propaganda/or lack thereof. I like the newspaper mechanic, but it's too powerful. One ship engagement (even if you win it) can raise your entire map level of riots. It's a fun mechanic/idea, but I think it plays too large of a part, especially when using propaganda affects the happiness of your residents: this can make a huge difference in investor and engineer classes affecting your population/income.

My advice to new players: your first goal should be to get your economy into a positive income output. I know that sounds like a no-brainer, but it's quite easy to get carried away in building, population, and upgrades without fully understanding the economy. Even if it's not a huge amount of positive income, having enough to prevent your economy from trickling down is enough to take additional time to explore, start building alliances/relationships with adversaries, and begin understanding how everything is inter-related. 

I'm happy that I've returned and re-written this review, because I do feel that this is a great game.",1708272545,1708444913,True,0,0,0.555772781372070313,0,True,False,False

My only option is to buy all DLC separately in addition to the base game for a whopping $135 total while people who never bought the base game get everything for $60.

And to add insult to injury, the individual DLC ARE on sale on Ubisoft's store, which is not an option if you bought the base game on Steam.

Ubisoft has lost their minds.

[EDIT]: 5/12/23 Ubisoft, you finally have DLC and ""Year 4 Complete Edition"" on sale yet I STILL can't buy ""Year 4 Complete Edition"" and the individual DLCs even at sale price come out to $53, making my total cost $120 while anybody who doesn't own it gets everything for $53.

Never buying another Ubisoft game.

I pre-ordered this game which allowed me to get it on Steam before it was an Epic exclusive. 2 yeas later Ubisoft saw the error of their ways and put it on Steam. Poop to Ubisoft for making this an exclusive in the first place. 

The tl;dr version of this review? Get it. If you're at all interested in this genre (city building & supply chain management), this is the pinnacle of it.

[u]Summary [/u]
Anno is a city building series based on creating cities across islands and producing goods in increasingly-complex supply chains. You provide these goods to your citizens to upgrade their housing to the next level, which then opens the door for bigger, more complex supply chains. Unlike many games of this type, the houses don't devolve if the goods run out. However, fewer citizens will live in those houses and become increasingly irate until you meet their needs again.

It's a city builder that require the player to spin a lot of plates. Beyond just the basics of the supply chain management, you have trade routes, competitors, pirates, quests, city beautification, fires, riots and other mechanics. There's never a dull moment here and it's not the type of city builder you can just run in the background and it'll do its thing (aka City Skylines). This requires active participation by the player. 

A typical challenge might go like this:
-I need more Level 2 workers
-Hmmm...need more clothing to upgrade the Level 1 houses.
-Need to build two sheep farms 
-Need to build a tailor
-Oh, that overloaded the warehouse. Need another one.
-With those new industries, I now need more level 1 workers
-Build level 1 homes
-Those homes are too far away from the city center so I need to upgrade the roads
-With those new homes, I'm running out of food and need more fish
-Oh wait, there's a fire
-Pirates are firing on my trade ship, need to get some protection over there
-There's a new quest, let me get a ship to the right spot in the map
-There's an expedition, let me get a ship prepared for that
-What was I doing again???

It's amazingly fun when it's working and it really does work in 1800. The chains are fun, the goods are somewhat interesting and as you can tell there's a constant stream of distractions - quests, story, newspaper articles, exploration, ship combat (with various different types of ships), colonizing other islands, going to the New World (which is a whole new region with all new supply chains) - to break up any monotony with balancing your happy little island. I've been playing the Anno series since 1404 and this surpasses even that beloved title. The Anno titles have always been a bit divisive and if you didn't like past versions you won't like this one. But if you thought 2205 or 2070 was simply ""meh"" you probably need to look at this one closely because the time period simply fits the game mechanics so much better. With this series, the past works much better than the futuristic versions. This game really does feel like you're progressing through the industrial age and it makes a wonderful time period to experience. Going from simple farming and clothing manufacturing to full blown advanced weaponry, railroads and building steam carriages makes you feel like you're always making progress.

Another great thing is this game has a lot of play options. You could play the campaigns (which I'm finally working through), various scenarios or a sandbox. You can choose if there are AI characters to play with/against, pirates or whether you're just on your own. I actually suggest turning off the AI competitors while learning to play and just focus on getting the supply chain management down. Then start turning on the AI to focus more on concepts like diplomacy and trade.  

Graphically, this game is pure eye-candy. This series has always been known for great graphics and this doesn't disappoint. From the birds-eye view to the street-level view, it's just a great game to look at. The detail is amazing and the color pallet and art style (unlike Anno 2070) really shine here. It's bright, cheerful and just a wonder to behold. The music is also fantastic. There's nothing overt here like the Civ IV Baba Yetu theme that won a Grammy but it's well done period-piece music that sets the theme. It's gentle most of the time but ramps up when there's a fire or a battle. The voice acting is not great, not bad but it's not much of a factor either. 
 
Of course, there are always warts. There's also excessive NPC banter, especially when spamming alliance offers. Sometimes I'd just like to be left alone with my creation. Ship combat is very sluggish and it's not very tactical. Whoever is first with the most wins and it's difficult to escape a losing battle. It's a bit of a system hog as well but it runs well enough on my aging mid-level PC (2070 SUPER) that most people won't have a problem.

It also contains UbiSoft Connect but that has worked pretty seamlessly after some initial release issues. The biggest downside to me? It's the UbiSoft Grand Gallery, which is where you can buy some items for your game. Many of these are cosmetic and not a big deal but some of these are real game-changers, like a resource (Bruno Ironbright) that you can put into a trade union near some factories that will fundamentally alter the way you play your game. These items are hidden behind Golden Tickets, which are obtained via scenarios. To get enough of these tickets, you'd have to grind through scenarios. No thank you. Luckily, there's a mod that bypasses these tickets so you can buy these items and incorporate them in your game. 

[u]DLC[/u]
Regarding the DLC, there's a lot. I recommend that you don't buy much of it at all when you start. Season 1 is fine because it adds in some easy mechanics (Botanical), a new big island to play with and an Arctic region if you want to go there. But as for the rest? Wait. This game is quite complicated with a lot of different mechanics and strategies. You won't need any new mechanics for a while. If you get into the game and really enjoy it then get the DLC at that point. It goes on sale often enough it's not an issue.

[u]Conclusion[/u]
This is truly a great game. It'll be one of the most complicated city builders that you'll ever play (Soviet Workers is more complex) and it'll have you spinning plates at all times. But it's a ton of fun and it's a must buy for those interested in the genre.",1555468263,1708032545,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

If I wanted to do research I would go back to college become a computer programmer and make a better game. Like many civ/city building games there are flaws that are un-resolvable which result in defeat. In Anno 1800 one example is the circle of needing workers to provide the materials that make farmers happy so that you can make them into workers. So if you have a worker shortage you need to promote farmers to workers (which makes no sense to begin with). The problem is that your farmers need ALL of their desires met before you can promote them to workers. Now if the farmers desire soap you need workers to make the soap to give to the farmers, but you have a shortage of workers so you are not producing soap. You need a full workforce to produce more workforce. If you hit an imbalance and are short on workforce you are just done. Like the many games that have workers that will not produce food when they get hungry so they starve.

The AI cheats.  Its as simple as that.  How it is even possible that the AI can get away with certain things while developing islands that you the gamer cannot?  Just review an island after purchasing all of its shares and you'll be shocked at what you find.

Ubisoft Blue Byte has crafted a gem that not only pays homage to the past but also sets a new standard for the Anno series.

The first thing that strikes players is the game's visual splendor. The attention to detail in recreating the architectural wonders of the 19th century is awe-inspiring. From the bustling cities to the lush countryside, every frame is a testament to the developers' commitment to creating a visually stunning and immersive world.

The gameplay in Anno 1800 strikes a perfect balance between accessibility and complexity. The city-building mechanics are intuitive, allowing players to quickly establish flourishing cities. Yet, as your society progresses through various eras, the depth of the gameplay emerges, presenting challenges that require thoughtful planning and resource management.

The production chain mechanics, where each product has its own supply chain, add a layer of realism and complexity to the economic simulation. Balancing the needs of your citizens, managing trade routes, and optimizing production chains become a satisfying puzzle that keeps you engaged for hours.

Diplomacy and trade play a crucial role in Anno 1800. Establishing alliances, engaging in trade agreements, and navigating the political landscape add a strategic layer to the game. The dynamic nature of the world, with AI opponents vying for dominance, creates a living and evolving environment.

The soundtrack deserves special mention, as it beautifully complements the game's atmosphere, enhancing the historical immersion. The sound of a bustling city, the creaking of ships, and the orchestral score all contribute to the game's sense of time and place.

Anno 1800's continuous support with expansions and updates demonstrates the developers' commitment to the player community. Each expansion brings new challenges, features, and content, ensuring that the game remains fresh and exciting long after the initial release.

While the game is a triumph, some players may find the learning curve a bit steep, especially for newcomers to the Anno series. However, the robust tutorial system and the active community provide ample resources for players to master the intricacies of city planning and management.

In conclusion, Anno 1800 is a stellar addition to the city-building genre, successfully marrying historical accuracy with engaging gameplay. Its blend of accessibility, complexity, and attention to detail make it a must-play for fans of city-building games. Ubisoft Blue Byte has not just recreated an era; they've crafted a timeless experience that will keep players enthralled for years to come.",1706889096,1706889096,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Some DLC mechanics feel very necessary such as bright harvest, docklands, seeds of change. Most dlcs add a lot of content and boosts that you may want earlier in the game however starting with all of them at once may feel overwhelming. I played the base game and added them in piecemeal but now that im playing with all of them on i cant imagine not. Some DLC mechanics feel very necessary. I would not recommend playing without these from the get go especially Season 3. My biggest complaint is how necessary docklands is, yet despite paying for the privilege moving the main dockland building is total ass.

UPDATE: I can no longer load any saved games, the game is therefore unplayable. I tried clearing old saves, reinstalling the game, launching through ubisoft, disabling ubisof overlay, moving the save file folder around, clearing shaders, switching between dx11 and 12, reloading ubisoft connect. I am about to rebuild my computer in a few updates and will be very disappointed if the issue still persists.

ISSUE SOLVED!  I hope this helps someone out there: I began loading older saves, there seemed to be blocks of unstable saves that would crash when selected eventually i found the latest working save by process of elimnation. I lost 3-5 hours progress and probably spent that much time troubleshooting on the assumption that every save was corrupt. Im a little salty but it turns out i was mostly wasting my own time, if i liked the game less then it would be an issue.

Dlcs are a bit of an hit and miss, some are good and add new interesting features and maps, others a bit less.
Strongly dislike the fact that it still uses DRM bloatware like Denuvo and needs an Ubisoft connect account and client to work, needs to be always connected even on single player, an other very controversial thing in my opinion.

I even pushed through the absolute annoyance that is Denuvo because it's so good I insist on paying.

Pretty steep learning curve at the very first, Campaign Mode helps a little to understand basic mechanic but it teaches all the wrong lesson in actual strat every Anno 1800 players are familiar with.
(e.g. postponing on producing steel until your balance is healthy, selling stuff to neutral AI, etc)
You have to read/watch guides if you want to be actually decent at the game. If you're the type who hate looking up things, this might not be an enjoyable experience for you.

Game is absolutely gorgeous and well-polished, I wish I can just relax and watch my people walking around. There's always something to do though.
The team knows the fanbase very well; they put a non-intrusive warning every two hours to remind you to take a break and stuff. Very helpful for people with time-blindness, who coincidentally are also the people who would play this kind of game extensively. (Yall my on-the-spectrum friends, I see you)

Pro List-
    * The game is super pretty for its genre.  I catch myself just watching the production factories.
    * Addicting game play.  Get lost for hours maximizing spacing and population limits

    * No issues with crashes or any type of quality control issues

Con List - 
    * Have some strong Google-Fu.  No much in terms of instructions on what your doing sometimes.
    * Stopping time is a hard pause.  You can speed up and slow, but not hard pause to build or make massive changes to your builds.

I love city builders and this one is in what historically a favorite time period for me. Some people decry the lack of robust warfare in the game, I how ever prefer it being back seat to the empire building aspect.

    And you rarely see a podcast going through the campaign - which is one of the nicest tutorials for any game I have played. Yes some of it is on the corny side but over all a good story intro to the game, especially if you are new to Anno games. 

    They have had several good DLC releases and I have bought all of them and the cosmetic packs. Folks have favorites in the DLC choices and a little reading or video watching will let you know if any one of them is something you would like as an add on. I like this game enough that if they kept putting out content for another 5 years I would keep buying them. But I love the time period so will always love to see it keep going.

    Is it a perfect game, no but they have the bugs worked out and it runs smoothly on most fairly up to date machines. The biggest issue I have found comes with less than 16 gigs of ram if you play for hours in a row and or have a lot of mods running. I am a big fan of mods that give you different visual options and there are a lot of good ones out there. And now that a modding hub is right there in the main screen when you start the game - it doesn't get any easier. And the mods can really help make the game a visual treat and tweak game play if you have issues with some aspects. The game is on sale here on Steam often any more as its been out for some time now and worth giving it a try if you have not at this point.

    I am retired and have a LOT of time to game and now have over 4ooo hours into this game and recommend it to anyone who has interest in the 1800 era, or just enjoys city builders.",1705078756,1705078756,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even on easy start campaign I find myself hemorrhaging money to the point that I am more stressed about correcting supply chain balance on multiple islands and trading between them then I am on an average work day. I play Civ a lot, and while I know it is different, the stress of managing just one city in Anno at the start of the game is higher than late game Civ empire with 100+ units. 

I have restarted 3 times and got further each time until I inevitable reach a point where the people want more things but can't produce them. I finally got to settling a new island and out of nowhere I'm losing so much money I can't recoup it. Its also crazy that on the increased help option for the campaign it doesn't explain most of the basic concepts so you crawl around in the dark until you figure it out too late to save the city. Crazy feedback loop if you get it even a bit off and suddenly you just want to stop playing.

Also the Ubisoft Connect launcher is complete ass. It asks me to log in EVERY SINGLE TIME even when I have it set to remember me. Avoid this game just for the launcher.

Expected something like the Stronghold games or even Command and Conquer...military strategy mixed with economy building.  Instead, I got something far closer to Ceasar 3...a deeply (overly?) complicated city builder with a tiny bit of combat thrown in so they aren't just another Sim City.  This reminded me a lot of the Ceasar games, but just made for modern times.  If you like city builders like Sim City, Ceasar, etc., you'll love this game.  If you don't like them, (I normally don't), you may want to pass on this.  Still, it's the best I've played in this category and I have had fun playing it, despite not really liking this genre all that much.

*Updated Section Below*

There are three issues I have with this game that tip the scale into the negative...one is the most major issue.  From least offensive to most egregious: First, there are an insane number of DLCs that need to be purchased separately and it feels like a greedy money grab.  Second, they require you to install another launcher app to launch the program, which also requires you to create an account with ubisoft.  Why?  I have no idea, but it's ridiculous.  Finally...and the main reason this otherwise incredible game cannot be recommended...the loading screen is simply a warning about epilepsy and takes FOREVER to load the main game.  

At first, the screen only took 30 seconds or so.  Now, I wait for 10-15 minutes with no progress bar to tell me if the game has frozen or not before it finally loads.  Yesterday, I actually watched an entire episode of the The Big Bang Theory while waiting on that screen and made it a few minutes into the next episode before the game loaded.  The longer I've played the game, the worse that loading screen got.  I have 16gb of RAM.  I have an i7.  I have 1.2TB of free harddrive space.  My video card is 6gb of VRAM.  I should not have these issues...yet this game (and only this game) gets stuck on the epilepsy warning screen for so long that I refuse to even open the game anymore.  If I could get a refund, I would.  As it is now, this game is simply unplayable anymore.",1702763872,1704918742,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

[h1] Pros [/h1]

Characters: The game has an amazing campaign with characters who are voiced beautifully, believable, and perfectly represented in the time period they are supposed to be in. 

Introduction/Campaign: The Campaign is fun and very easy to understand as it holds your hand as much as you'd like or as little as you need. After completing a certain arc or act and progressing far enough into the campaign the game swaps over to Sandbox mode where you'll be spending the rest of your time building up your village and insuring that everyone is happy.

Events/Diplomacy: Another great feature and installment. There are multiple events that can range from your civilians to other rulers/players. You are able to set trade routes and establish defense pacts to keep others from attacking you.

Graphics/Animation: This game looks amazing, not only does it look fantastic but there is attention to detail. Each House, Farm, Fire station, Pub, and little civilian walking around town has their own unique trail and bit of clothing. While it doesn't have the Tropico naming or distinguish feature you'll almost never see the same civilian more than a handful of times.

Mod Support: I haven't used this feature so I can't talk much about it, but a quick browse showed there is a lot of mods and the community is still very active so loads of things to check into if you want to try a different styled game.

Management/Skill: The game can become very hard very quickly if you overbuild or extort your workers too much. But overall it's a slow climb and easy to understand. You are able to manage your workers to produce more items or less which helps with happiness, you are able to make farmers into workers and upgrade the workers so that you are able to manage money and production of other things. I haven't played much with the boats but there's also Navel management required.

[h2] CONS [/h2]

Okay, as fantastic as this game is there is some stuff I have to point out. Fortunately or unfortunately the things I have to mention have nothing to do with the game itself, but with the shady practices done by Ubisoft themselves.

Money/Management: Okay the only reason why this is a CON aswell a PRO is because of how easy it is to fall in debt with the game providing you a very simplistic graph on how  your economy is doing. Personally I've seen this tab be performed better in other games and it felt far too simplistic in this game and for this type of game.

DLC: There is far too many DLC and each are over priced with adding little to nothing but cosmetics. Some have added Scenario's which do add gameplay or unlocks but to see this many DLC it makes me wonder what I'd be missing out on or anyone who didn't bother getting it. 

Uplay/Offline Mode: You are unable to play in offline mode and your dlc will not be recognized. 

That's all I have to say. As for score.  [h3] GAMEPLAY 10/10  STORY 10/10  [/h3] [b] THIS IS A MUST BUY [/b]",1704420678,1704420678,True,3,0,0.523333311080932617,0,True,False,False

I have been an avid gamer for years, but I've never come across a strategy game quite like this one. It's safe to say that this game has redefined the entire genre and set a new standard for excellence. In my eyes, it's nothing short of the best game ever made.

From the moment I started playing, I was completely captivated by the depth of strategy and complexity this game offers. The game-play mechanics are not only intuitive but also incredibly well thought out, making it accessible for newcomers while providing a challenging experience for seasoned strategy enthusiasts. It's a game that manages to strike the perfect balance between accessibility and depth.

One of the game's standout features is its intricate world-building and lore. The attention to detail in creating a rich and immersive universe is truly commendable. Every faction, every unit, and every building feels like a part of a meticulously crafted tapestry. The game's narrative is engrossing, and it's easy to get lost in the lore while developing your own story within this fantastical world using multiple islands and using different ships.

What truly sets this game apart, though, is its tactical depth. The strategy involved in managing resources, diplomacy, and warfare is simply unmatched. Every decision you make has far-reaching consequences, and the dynamic nature of the game ensures that every play-through is a unique experience. Whether you're forging alliances, waging epic battles, or engaging in intricate political maneuvering, the choices you make matter.

The graphics are insane – I felt like I was living in the industrial age with all the hustle and bustle. The game isn't just eye candy though; it's got this perfect mix of being challenging but not too complicated.

I loved how it throws you into the nitty-gritty of managing resources, trade routes, and making diplomatic moves. And when they added the New World into the mix, managing multiple islands became a wild ride! It keeps you hooked because every decision you make has consequences that ripple through your city.

What really sets Anno 1800 apart is how it sticks to history. It's not just a game; it's a history lesson! The buildings, the tech – everything screams industrial revolution. And the music! It's like the game has its own emotional soundtrack that fits perfectly with the ups and downs of building your empire.

And guess what? It's not just a solo gig; you can team up or go head-to-head with friends online. The multiplayer adds a whole new dimension to the game.

the game runs off production chains, you place a building, it gets resources, or make resources into something, continue chain with different buildings until you get the final product, which usually goes to the upper class citizens, with stuff lower in the chain going to the lower classes.

the game is mainly about building houses, and keeping the people happy by fulfilling their needs and wants, needs would be stuff like clothes, market buildings nearby for food, ect, and wants would be for stuff like pubs and chocolate. if you dont fulfil needs, you lose alot of money, population and eventually lose the game, if you dont fulfil wants, the people wont be happy, and your progress will be very slow

there are different tiers of citizens with progressively more needs and wants the higher their class, for example, farmers need markets, fish, and clothes, and want schnapps and pubs, whereas engineers require like 25 things including electricity, working railways, and a whole lot more, not to mention you still need the lower tiers of population to work certain jobs, you wont find an engineer in a farm

overall, takes some getting use to, definitely recommend looking up industry area designs and housing block designs, might take some effort to find ones that let you customise a bit so your not just copying the same designs with no decoration.",1703979321,1703979321,True,1,0,0.516129016876220703,0,True,False,False

Throughout my playthrough of Anno 1800. All i ever care about is Ditchwater (the starting island), which I later renamed to Augustgrad after the campaign is finished. I only developed La isla (the first colony island you get) until I can extract its oil so that I can send it to Augustgrad, because meagre oil available in the old world is not enough. 

Once oil from La Isla is not enough, I started developing Prosperity (another island in the new world) which I haven't even touched at all for some time, just so that I can send more oil to the old world. And then I started needing so much more rubber, so I started sending steam engines to the new world so that I can farm those rubber faster. Then those damn investors wanted cigarrettes, so I had to send even more steam engines to farm those even more faster. 

Eventually, La isla and Prosperity alone is not enough as my ambitions reached Trelawney and later the arctic. So I colonized Manola (a large empty island in the new world) and developed it to be my factory island on the new world. Chocolates, cigarettes, rubber gums, ethanols, mezcals, hot sauce, coffees. Everything is produced there, and none of them are given to the locals. All of it goes to Augustgrad. I even started the Aluminium production chain only to built everything on the old world so that i can satisfy their lettering needs.

I kept telling to myself that I'll eventually make the new world prosper as soon the supply to the old world is stabilized... but it never did... the people always wanted more... there's always something lacking somewhere that lowered the number of digits on my income. I don't like that... so I kept expanding, scrubbing wealth, exploiting the land.

And yet... like Dostoevsky once said. If the people are bereft of any problems, any troubles in their life. If all they have to do in life is to eat cakes, sing, write poems, do arts, and enjoy their blissful life. They will take it upon themselves to create problems out of thin air. thin air. out of sheer ingratitude just so that they will have their way. I have given everything to my people, yet they are never satisfied. I have eliminated all of my competitions (except Qing, I couldn't do that to her) and yet, they are not satisfied. 

They all live in their palaces of glass and steel, looking down from the heavens that were so unreachable just decades ago. And yet, they are not satisfied. I haven't touched Enbessa yet (the in lore Northern Africa). I am one button away from finishing the expedition and unlocking the region. But I know what will eventually happen to the people of that land to. They will be the foundations upon which the glass palaces of my old world will be built on. They will want more. They always want more. They want everything there is to ever want. They will desire everything until there's nothing else to desire. What happens after that? What happens after you've eaten all the cakes you could ever eat? drank all the drinks you could ever drink? What happens after you've written all the poems, seen all the arts. What happens when you have all there is to desire, and yet, you still desire for more?

A surprisingly deep city builder with tons of supply chain problemsolving. 

Graphics and Atmosphere:
Visually stunning, Anno 1800 transports players to the dawn of the industrial age with meticulously crafted landscapes and highly detailed buildings, Immersing players in the charming ambiance of the 19th century. The day-night cycle and dynamic weather further enhance the game's visual appeal.

City-Building and Management:
Anno 1800 excels in providing a deep and engaging city-building experience. The game's intricate economy system challenges players to balance production chains, trade routes, and the needs of their growing population. The satisfaction derived from successfully optimizing your city's layout and resources is immensely rewarding.

Historical Authenticity:
One of the standout features of Anno 1800 is its commitment to historical authenticity. From the architecture to the technological advancements, the game meticulously recreates the era. Though this isn't merely a historically accurate game. The aesthetics get steampunky relatively quick, but not in a disbelievable way. It's obvious that the devs worked with concepts of ""what could have been"" as a substitute to various designs (some of the vehicles are clearly steampunk)

Strategic Depth:
Anno 1800 is not merely a city-builder. The base game offers the Old World & the New World as two worlds you play simultaneously, managing supply lines & trade between your islands in both. With DLC, the amount of unique sessions (Enbesa, an African colony inspired session & the Arctic) expands, offering for even more trade & supply line management.

Minor Drawbacks:
It's not without a few minor drawbacks. Some players might find the learning curve steep initially, especially for newcomers to the franchise. Additionally, the game's system requirements may be demanding for older hardware. (As most strategy games, the more RAM, the merrier. an SSD is recommended)

Conclusion: A fantastic city-builder worth the full price even now. Though, I do recommend buying the game on sale, as it goes for pretty low prices quite often. And I absolutely recommend the DLCs, atleast the Season Passes 1-4. Cosmetics DLCs are up to you.",1703720673,1703720759,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

DONT! You will have a headache, you will probably curse all day long, and you will probably give in, and once again either make a new account or reset your password-again!

Doesn't really tell you all what you have to pay attention to. The upgrades are very fluid, you cannot ever know exactly how much that you have of people/products because they will come and go, which just makes it hard to manage things. Trade routes are weird and setting up trades with npcs is. The way the fog of war clears is jarring and paired with the way you move around the map from location to location as creator makes it hard to see everything. The menus aren't great. They really need an economy tab where I can view all my locations for a particular product.  The biggest thing though, is that I will just randomly be defeated? and the game will take me back to the title screen for seemingly no reason. There is virtually no indications that this kind of thing is happening. I didn't get all my shares bought up. I had a bunch of stuff going on. I had trade routes and had completed all my missions that had timers except the one I just picked up, and from what I could tell I was doing great, but I'd get defeated. And it doesn't even tell you why you got defeated, just that you are... blank screen with a button that takes you to the title? Like wtf? And npcs will just randomly decide they do or don't like you anymore? There needs to be a way to control this more. Also, other leaders don't like my propaganda....its propaganda, why do they even know I'm using it? Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of propaganda? Just needs to be majorly cleaned up. For the way you move around the board and how many different places your fleet can be it is absolutely LUDICROUS to me that there is no proper pause. You can 'slow down' but its really not enough for proper planning, especially when you can potentially buy up the whole map, but you can't ever pause anything to get a full scope of what you are doing? This game leaves me wanting terribly. 
The game is cute and i like how it looks but play Frostpunk or Going Medieval or something if you don't want to deal with awkward and unexpected 'Defeats,' confusing vague instructions, and horribly disorganized menus.",1703382712,1703382712,False,3,0,0.540389955043792725,0,True,False,False

It took about 3 tries to beat the campaign on Normal without going broke.  I did read some of the guides in order to plan my islands better.
In general don't overbuild and you can run a profit at least on your main island and then use trade and 'favors' with the NPCs to make money.
I realize this game has been out there for a while and there is a lot of DLC, not sure where to go next.  Either push on with the campaign (as a sandbox?) or start again with a sandbox.  I found flipping between the old and new worlds a bit annoying or distracting as some of the RTS combat requires your full attention to win.
Pirates can be challenging but also annoying.  You can turn them off in a sanbox game.
'Blueprint' or planning mode is your friend.  It allows you to allocate space for future builds without paying for them.   I tend to run on half-speed as it prevents me from accidentally going too far into the red.

Pros:
City building
'Historical Units' and progression
Challenging economy
Pirates and bad guys
Building fleets

Cons:
Takes a long time to load and get running
If you have a large town, some of the 'find the ..."" quests get too involved
You can't plan if the game is paused
Flipping back and forth from the New to the old world

Issue 1: Denuvo
I don't think I need to say much more here. Denuvo objectively hinders game performance in return for not stopping piracy whatsoever.

Issue 2: Uplay
Or connect or whatever they call it these days. Again, the only actual function of this is to make pirated copies function and perform better than legitimate copies.
If you play this game without buying it, you get to avoid:
Logging in to your Ubisoft account repeatedly
Loading a launcher that doesn't always work, especially hindering on SteamDeck
Instantly losing your game progress because your Internet cut out
Uplay Offline mode still requires semi-regular log in and Internet connection for literally no reason whatsoever.

seriously guys I would spend more money on this if you would put some real time and effort into the extended content. Charge more money for it, go back to the days of 2070 where you released actual expansions.

All in all I was hyped for this game for years. Long time Anno fan, love the setting of this and the gameplay is (mostly) improved on previous installments.

It's not completely fair to judge the game based on that, but it was annoying that I had to uninstall a few things to get this on. Speaking of annoying, the cockney accents fall into that category.

I like mostly everything about this game. If you get this game make sure to buy the season packs 1,2,3, and 4. The cosmetic stuff i passed on. You build residents, and you build factories, you build more residents and you build more factories, Every factory is specific to what it does, and i love the complex. Just wish this game was better optimized for CPU. I have the Amd 7950x3d and it should be working but this game is only allowed for 1 core when i have total of 16, Feel like when you have 500k-1M pop, it would run much better with Multicore optimization. Just hope they improve this in the next Anno, cause i will be 100% sure to get it.

Downsides/Comparisons:

I've played anno 2070 before this. It's cheaper, has a MUCH longer campaign, runs better, has a much cooler multiplayer experience (asynchronous competitions are cool).

Both games have third party launchers (yay, twice the DRM to cause problems or screw you in 10 years!), and high priced DLC, there is no way at all I can recommend this series at full price. If you want to experience it, wait until it's 75% off again like it was when I got it. (20 CAD). Same goes for the DLC.


Mixed: 
Since the new content partly takes the form of new maps, which play at the same time as your other map, your attention has to be in many places at once. You have items which can only be farmed in each respective map, which forces trade between maps. This is nice, and adds content and replayability, however it makes the game very hard to juggle this many trade routes and combat. Fighting enemy ships in 4 different maps at the same time is incredibly difficult, especially with the AI units being fairly smart in being able to retreat from fights.

Multiple maps at once may also be the reason that the game starts running into optimization problems late game.

Upside: 
It still gives the addicting Anno gameplay, I will have many more hours after this review, due to the amount of content that this game has. With all of the DLC, there are a LOT of items to create, and a lot of people to meet. The general population in your worlds can have some of their happiness and needs ""replaced"" with some of these new items. This makes me realize that every run is going to be unique, based on which resources I happen to be able to keep and fight for. For example, if it's not possible for me to obtain chocolate, I will be able to travel to a different map and help by using a different resource from a different DLC.

The game has a lot of polish. Production numbers are mostly easy to compare, the building feels better than in 2070. Being able to move buildings instead of destroy, find the menu, and rebuild is very good.

Mod support built in to the main menu is very good. Adding mods is very simple.

One of the things I would find to make the trading better would be if there is a checkbox in the production pages, to estimate how many items would be transferred to the other island's productivity page.

Maybe the modding community has similar ideas, or I can try to create that kind of idea myself.

Anyways, hope the review helps",1701146314,1702145041,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

As others have mentioned there's the Ubisoft launcher and Cloud saves that takes forever to load. Another issue is that the base game isn't really that big. One must spend way more money on DLCs that seem could rather have been added to the game as updates instead. 

Bought this game on sale for about 15$ and don't really regret buying it. Yet I feel I didn't buy the entire game and even on sale all the DLCs and the main game would have cost the same as full price for a proper game.

After a while it can get fairly difficult to manage so be prepared to struggle some. I believe i made to the point where there isn't anything to do other than try to destroy all the AI players. It also seems like there's more to the game though because i see items in my inventory that i can't seem to get access to. Must be some other ""World"" than the old world and the new world. I dunno. It would be good also to have a little more info. Some overview info on what you need to do to advance other than what your Sister or Friend tell you. I played it for many many hours/days and did enjoy it truly. I would suggest to the developers to make it possible to automate things easier and make trade routes easier to manage. Sometimes you spend way too much time trying to figure out better ways to ship things to your islands when a person should be enjoying spending time playing around with the pirates. There are ways to make thing easier by not giving your people what the want but i don't feel that's a good way to have a strong economy. Anyway, if you like building and managing games this would definitely be one to play. Just be prepared to have a little frustration at times.
EDIT: So I did find more info on here in Steam. Seems like I would need to buy more downloads to continue on the path. Also found out that i should have Hammered Beryl early in the game to gain more control of things. Well, I guess a restart is in order then....",1701939633,1701941256,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's the first game i found where you can do relaxed city building in multiplayer. It works fast and good.
The only things that could be better is some ui changes some controls feel a bit clumpsy.
Also sometimes ships are just stupid. More options to decide their route would be nice. It always takes the shortest route instead of the safest.

This is my own opinion.. The game is fine for those of who love the DLC-Madness this game have turned into....
But even tho I have 60+ hours in this game. I feel this game has missed out on so much. im sure some find it amazing to explore 4+ new interrely pointless worlds

 it had potential to become so much fun with line battles, cannons and more! Its the 1800s for christ sake!! 
and before all the fanbois yell at me: [spoiler] BUT ITS ANNO! ITS NOT MEANT FOR COMBAT?! [/spoiler]

Oh really?! Look at the old games- 1503 - 1701 - 1401 and say that again! Heck even 2070 have better combat then 1800
And another small thing that makes my Pi'ss boil is in Anno 1800 there is Female Admirals ON EVERY SHIP!?! Dafüq!? No woman where allowed on ships doing the 1800s! certainly not in the:  Queen Elisabeth: Her Mastrity Queen's Royal  Navy!

This is a game about controlling supply chains and balancing productions and logistic organization.

The game is overwhelming at first, I don't think you should start with any of the DLCs until you get a good handle on the endless number of mechanics. While there are countless mechanics, the core gameplay is straight forward and not terribly difficult to get ahold of.

Anno 1800 is more micromanagement than I want in a game.  I like the Tropico series, so I thought this might be similar, and it sort of is, but it's a lot more involved.

Sadly the campaign doesn't explain a lot of the basics (like happiness = taxation), and a made some big mistakes early on that I struggled to undo.  I thought I was finally getting the hang of things, but then the game introduced juggling multiple islands and map regions along with ship battles at the same time.

And it got me hooked. I've played it for hours and hours and came back to it over the years. Same with Anno 1404 later on. I was quite disappointed with the newer parts of the Anno-series (in which I never got into), so I was very reluctant regarding Anno 1800. In the end, I bought it on sale with the season passes and I do not regret it at all. 
It manages to have the charm of older Anno games while being way more complex and offering a lot more possibilities than its predecessors. The basics are the same to the other parts of the series, but the biggest change for me was the fact that now all citizens need to [b]work[/b]! I was used to having all my production chains separated from my citizens living their high life without working. Now they are the ones keeping the industry going. As being used to especially Anno 1701 I quickly let my farmers become workers only to realize that I need farmers for my - well farms. So after promoting everyone I had to demote a few to keep my economy running. This function made more problems, when I realized that I now had to have a settlement on every island instead of only having farms and factories. So in the end instead of having one city to grow I ended up with quite a few. And then there was the new world. A completely new map with completely different product chains and housings. The latter I knew from Anno 1404 but there everything took place on the same map. Now playing with the DLCs I still sometimes struggle with not getting lost on what to do. On the other hand - it never gets boring because there is always at least one settlement unhappy.
Apart from that I also like the feature attractiveness and the income you can generate from tourists is awesome. Keeping me out of the red too often. My secret aim is having every available animal at least once in my already far too big zoo.
The newspaper function is fine. Depending on the headlines you can get benefits or disadvantages which has some influence, but it gets a little repetitive over time (always the same stuff going on, ay?)

The biggest issue I have with this game is the campaign, which - at least in my eyes - is weak in comparison to the ones of 1701 and 1404 (I can only compare it to those two because I haven't played the other parts long enough or not at all). What I liked is that the chapters are more connected, they kinda blend into each other. So the situation (location of buildings, number of inhabitants etc.) at the end of each chapter is the same in the following one. The story in itself wasn't that bad, but the tasks were. [spoiler] I was especially disappointed with the last chapter. It didn't feel like the ending at all. The final boss, those admittedly creepy cultists where far too easy to defeat. I was preparing a huge fleet expecting an intense fight, but coincidentally I passed the enemy's fleet too close and all except one ship were following me right into my island's defence zone. That was incredibly stupid on part of the AI. And extremly anticlimatic. Apart from that there was literally nothing going on during this chapter. One little rescue mission which was fine and then endlessly repetitive ""find the arsonists"" quests. It felt like the developers just wanted to finish the campaign asap to focus on different things. [/spoiler]. But I appreciate the possibility of continuing with your settlement after the campaign is finished.

In the end some of the side quests, missions, expeditions are the same or of the same style but I'm okay with that for they are not mandatory. I just love the seemingly endless possibilities of the sandbox mode (I really recommend buying at least some DLCs) and just living my best life as gouvernor of my little islands and nourish and cherish them so that they'll grow and help me become rich. That's what it is about, isn't it?

Oh - I almost forgot to mention the blueprint feature, which is an awesome tool for planning your city. Like the possibility to move existing buildings to other places (for a certain prize depending on the selected difficulty mode).

- NPCs keep telling me useless things
- Tutorial popups frequently appear and cover things I am trying to interact with

One of the standout features of Anno 1800 is the sheer level of detail present in every aspect of the game. From the intricate architecture and period-specific designs of the buildings to the lush and vibrant landscapes, every element is meticulously crafted to immerse players in the world of the 19th century. The attention to detail extends to the city streets, where pedestrians hustle and bustle, carriages traverse the roads, and ships majestically sail through the waterways. Exploring the various environments feels like stepping into a living, breathing world.

What sets Anno 1800 apart from its predecessors is the studio's commitment to listening to the passionate Anno community. Blue Byte took the time to study player feedback and implemented changes that greatly enhance the gameplay experience. The result is a game that strikes a balance between accessibility and challenge, catering to both newcomers and seasoned veterans of the series. The developers have refined the game's mechanics, ensuring that players have more power and control over their city-building endeavors while still facing formidable challenges that test their strategic prowess. Also, the game empowers players with a wide array of tools and options to create truly beautiful and unique cities. The expansive building catalog offers an impressive selection of structures and decorations, allowing players to tailor their cities to their own personal vision. Whether it's constructing grand Victorian-style mansions or meticulously planned industrial districts, the level of customization is truly awe-inspiring.

However, Anno 1800 doesn't let players rest on their laurels. The game presents a series of challenges and obstacles that must be overcome to achieve success. From managing the delicate balance of resources and workforce to navigating complex trade routes and diplomatic relations, the game keeps players engaged and on their toes. The strategic depth and complexity ensure that every decision has consequences, making each playthrough a rewarding and thought-provoking experience.",1700647334,1700647334,True,4,0,0.551752209663391113,4,True,False,False

If  you like  being  able  to  develop your  own  systems/economy/military this  is the game  for  you.  The supply chain management is challenging  but not ridiculous and  many of the  aspects can  be automated.  I  have played numerous Anno1800 games,  but  I  have  paused  my current  one  by  not delivering the ships  to  the queen in order to halt the story line.  This has  allowed me to develop  several  islands  in the old world so  that I can support my colonies in the new  world when  I get there. It is great that the story line has not forcefully injected itself.

Onto  the  bad stuff

Ubisoft  connect  is  hot garbage.
It is impossible to play the  game  without connecting to  ubi  soft as it is extremely invasive. I  usually have to make  4 attempts to get the game  to  start due to ubi soft connect issues.  Once  the game  is running it  is flawless.  I will  generalize and  say  most players do  not care about whatever ubisoft connect does and  simply  want  to  play the game. I  am  capable of buying  expansions  or  DLCs  on  my  own  and  see no  reason  to  have  to  connect  with ubisoft.  

My final  gripe  is the  problem  with  influence.  I  think that maybe ""influence"" may be  lost in  translation  as no influence should be needed to build something  when  money,  material and a talented work force are plentiful.  When  the US Navy orders a new air craft carrier whether the president  is liked or is influential  is pointless.  Influence should be  used to  push  a work force to work  harder, or build something in  which  resources, funds  or a qualified workforce are highly  lacking.  I  currently have 43.8 million  dollars  but I cannot build a commuter peer because of influence. I'm sorry, with over 100 tons of windows, bricks,  steel,  wood  a  millions  of dollars  being  held back by  ""influence"" nearly  ruins  the  game.  I  have completed  many quests  and sunk  many pirates but  none have given  me more influence.  I am currently at a population of 40K and only have 20 influence.  Why does a gun  tower cost influence?  If  anything, the initiative to  protect my  islands should  increase  my  influence  among my  people.",1696863618,1699917249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

SimCity trifft auf weitere Strategie-Elemente. Micromanagement für Hardcore-Spieler, sei es der Platz auf den Inseln, Versorgungsketten, Geld, Up- und Downgraden von Siedlern und nicht zuletzt das ärgerliche Suchen, warum irgendwo ein Mangel herrscht, bei voller Gegenwehr durch die Benutzeroberfläche. Fügen wir eine völlig belanglose und langweile Kampagne hinzu, deren Protagnisten hochgradig stören, nervig und unfähig sind, bis hin zu den Antagonisten, die nicht begriffen haben, dass der größte Antagonist des Spiels, dass Spiel selbst ist.

Wer Spaß an Micromanagement, was seinem Namen hier Ehre macht, hat, für den könnte es etwas sein. Wer eine Simulation mit etwas Aktion erwartet, ist hier falsch.

Update nach weiteren 12 Stunden:
Multiplayer ist unsinnig, da ein Bestandteil des Spiels der Zeitraffer ist und dieser im Multiplayer nicht vorhanden ist. Ab 3 Inseln ist es ein beständiges Hopping und hoffentlich kommt kein Ereignis dazwischen.

Weiterhin fällt auf, sofern man heute das Spiel von gestern aufmacht, fragt man sich, was an der komplexen Ökonomie hatte man gestern im Sinn und verbringt Minuten damit, sich erneut eine Übersicht zu schaffen. Dies ist immer noch der größte Kritikpunkt: ÜBERSICHT! Sollte grundsätzlich wesentlich besser implementiert werden, wird vermutlich nicht mehr passieren.

SimCity meets further strategy elements. Micromanagement for hardcore gamers, be it the space on the islands, supply chains, money, upgrading and downgrading of settlers and, last but not least, the annoying search to find out why there is a shortage somewhere with full resistance from the user interface. Let's add a completely irrelevant and boring campaign, whose protagonists are highly annoying and incompetent, right down to the antagonists who don't
realized that the biggest antagonist of the game is the game itself.

Who enjoy micromanagement, which lives up to its name here, then this could be for you.If you're expecting a simulation with some action, you're in the wrong place.

Update
after another 12 hours:

Multiplayer is nonsensical, as a component of the game is the time lapse and this is not available in multiplayer. From 3 islands it is a constant hopping and hopefully no event comes in between.

Furthermore
it is noticeable that if you open yesterday's game today, you ask yourself what of the complex economy you had in mind yesterday and spend minutes to get an overview again. This is still the biggest point of criticism: OVERVIEW! Should basically be implemented much better probably won't happen anymore.

One is the MOD BROWSER not working (v.17.2.1263634). I had to search the web to find a way to have mods without it by using the IModYouAnno thanks to instructions given by someone (Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/anno1800/comments/17k6lo5/for_anyone_having_trouble_running_anno_1800_mods/).
It's a shame because it is such a good thing to have that kind of feature. That being said, the game has a lot of items to choose from and mods are not necessary from the start. For those who are not mods addicts, this game offers a lot already.
Such a pity that nothing was done for the sound problem. LESS THAN 100h playing and the sound is getting weird - No solution found online and nothing but problems reports - 
But, 
 I find the game really gorgeous and very interesting with a lot of different things to do and many ways to play. 
This is such a beautiful game! From the loading screen to the maps. Even the character we can choose to play with are very nice.
The water (sea/rivers) and randomly generated maps are absolutely awesome. I had been waiting for a long time to find a game as beautiful as 
Cities XXL with its most realistic sea, its beautiful foam, beautiful rivers, beautiful trees and beautiful maps.
I'm very glad to have found this game - magnificent maps,
Everything is really great, really detailed and well animated. All the needed tools are there, efficient and easy to use.
I play mostly for aesthetic rather than management. I like to build freely.
This game has a sandbox mode but also a creative mode that is 
really made for people like me. A friend of mine already got it, and he assured me it was a game for me...
I recommend this game to anyone who likes to build but also wants to have different things to do
(management, expeditions/quests/trade/diplomacy or war, etc.) 
Many and many hours in perspective.
There even is a FIRST PERSON MODE!!! If the animated characters/Sims are not that great being seen so close, it doesn't matter, the quality of the textures is sufficient for me to enjoy this mode. Some day, someone  will create a mod to change that...
 
For the rest, it seems that everything runs smoothly.  Now that I know this game, I have a great deal of difficulty to return to Cities Skylines 
because the water in CS is so ugly and the game is so demanding for my pc.

So congratulations to the creators.",1699668238,1699897529,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I did spend a fortune on this game, but to me it turns out to be not as good as rated.
It is beautiful, no question and who loves to play around with buildings will have a long time to do so, if you invest a lot of money in all add ons, but honestly that is it, there is no sea fights, no nice scenarios. The campaign is ok, but once you played that through you can only go to sandbox, because the scenarios seem to be a pain.

I know Anno was never easy, but even if you put this one to easy, you can't get even through the first scenario and I saw YouTubers had the same problem. Because I was wondering if it is just me.
I was playing this now 3 times through the sandbox and that is fun, the only fun I would say. If you buy all other maps it is pretty much fun even, but you need to pay for every  ....
The earlier Anno games were nicer in my opinion. So if you are new to this series you should be very happy with this game. If you loved the retro Anno games you'll probably go out with a meh feeling like me just because of this huge price ripp off.

More promissed than kept in my opinion. The narrator on the african map jells into your ears constantly, the arctic map lets you bring tons of coal or your people die. I really don't know if I'd call this fun. I did not want to play those maps again.
Say I am picky, yeah that might be true, but Anno was really once one of my most favourite games and I can't help than to think they are on their way to ruin this game experience. The last one I did not buy at all after the two before were annoying. This one is better, no question, but it still leaves you with a stange nostalgic feeling like the new The Guild game, were you say in the end: I want to play the old ones again, because they did not reach their level, except graphicwise.

Maybe it's the aesthetic? Maybe it's just the genuinely good gameplay/city building that sucks you in and suddenly HOURS have passed without your knowing.

This game FEELS like something that was released between 2000-2005, and I mean that in the best way. It simply has spirit. There is something here that makes me feel like I'm playing Black & White, or Sim Theme Park/World. Something that I could lose an entire night's sleep over and still be wide awake the very next day at school waiting impatiently to be back at home playing. There's just something very comfortable about Anno 1800. Every little detail has been meticulously crafted by an art/design team that just clearly loves their creation, and wants to watch it grow.

Long:
I had the pleasure of playing this game for free for two days. Not nearly enough for a good overall impression as I did almost everything wrong, but I was instantly hooked after that and I bought it on sale. One of my best purchases I might add. Very good price/quality/content (bought it for 75%off) It almost seems like a decked out love child between Age of Empires and Settlers, with a sprinkle of Sim City and a lovely historical accents. It is mentioned in the campaign that this games aid for new players or players unfamiliar with Anno is a bit too simple. I watched an quick explanation vid on Youtube and it gave me more than enough understanding of the game to start of a bit better, the campaign really pushes large expense buildings on you very early on in the game and if you follow that without enough revenue, you will go bankrupt in the first hours of playing.

And it just won't pick up even though your ship is on top of it. After Google, I learnt you need to select the ship, and then right click. So a sequence of clicking is expected, and there may be a delay (ship needs to ship to the location) the players need to wait, yet they don't tell you anything in game. I needed to Google / YouTube everything. Btw I still don't know how to go to my ship with a mouse only, and you need to select the ship to pick up etc. 

And the game doesn't even play well in windows mode - to move your view span window, it's much easier when it's full screen. So I need to switch out to Google. And of course it didn't tell you that the time will not pause in the game when you open a dialog or switch out (and I still don't know the real answer but on reddit people said pop up won't stop the timer), or what a timer means. Does it start the timer only after you click phase 1, or not? No it doesn't tell you and I need to miss some timed quests to learn. Why do you have to frustrate your players? I hate failures in a game. I'm a platinum pursuer when I played PlayStation games. If I missed something, I'd restart the entire game.

Review:

🎩🏭🚢 The Dawn of a New Era in My Social Life's Dusk

Let me tell you a tale of a game so grand,
That it sprawls across virtual land and sea.
It’s called Anno 1800, and by my hand,
It’s a masterclass in economy.

You start with a ship and a dream to unfold,
A city to build, a new world to command.
The year is 1800, we're bold,
With a top hat on head and a blueprint in hand.

🌍 World-Building Extravaganza:

Your isle is bare, but not for long,
For you’ll soon turn it into a buzzing throng.
With houses and factories, oh what glee!
Until the pollution makes no one able to see.

The residents have needs, ever so growing,
From fish and clothes to ale all flowing.
Meet their demands, and they'll caper,
Ignore them, and they'll snatch up the newspaper.

⚙️ Economy, Thy Name is Complexity:

It’s a puzzle, a dance, a delicate ruse,
With supply chains that might just light your fuse.
From farmers to workers, from artisans to more,
Your brain will be buzzing, never a bore.

Trade routes, diplomacy, expeditions afar,
You'll juggle them all like a circus star.
And just when you think you've got it all down,
Here comes a rival, ready to steal your crown.

🤖 Automation Nation:

The joy of Anno is in the orchestration,
Of a city that runs on full automation.
With a click and a drag, a route is set,
And your ships sail off without breaking a sweat.

The beauty, the detail, it’s almost surreal,
As your city grows under the great Ferris wheel.
And then it hits you, it's 2 AM,
But just one more trade route, you defend.

🎭 A Cast of Characters:

AI players, with personalities galore,
Will charm you, cheat you, and sometimes bore.
But the quests they bring, and their scheming ways,
Add a zest to your city-planning days.

There's even a zoo and a museum to build,
With artifacts and beasts, your city is gilded.
Culture, you see, is not left to chance,
Even in this industrial expanse.

🔊 Soundscapes and Sea Shanties:

Oh, and the music, it deserves its praise,
For it hums and it haunts through all your days.
The sound of the waves, the seagulls' cries,
Compose an ambiance that money can't buy.

💻 A Performance to Applaud:

But let’s not forget, this game runs deep,
Your CPU and GPU won’t get much sleep.
It’s a demanding affair, make no mistake,
But for such grandeur, it’s a fair stake.

📜 In Conclusion:

Anno 1800, it’s a historian’s delight,
A time machine that takes you to industrial might.
It’s a city builder, a strategist's dream,
A time sink, a brain tickler, a seamstress's seam.

So I tip my hat to you, dear Anno, you gem,
For the hours you’ve stolen, I can’t condemn.
It’s a five-star trip to the past, no doubt,
Now if you’ll excuse me, my city’s calling out!",1699175295,1699175295,True,5,0,0.539448559284210205,0,True,False,False

First and foremost, the game offers a variety of options that allow players with different disabilities to enjoy the experience fully. The ability to customize keybindings (especially for camera movement) is a godsend, as it enables players to set up controls that suit their individual needs. This flexibility is crucial for those of us who may have limited dexterity or mobility with mouse controls, as it ensures we can play the game comfortably and without frustration.

The inclusion of options for large subtitles, increased camera distance, and camera sensitivity adjustments in Anno 1800 further exemplifies the game's dedication to accessibility.

Large subtitles are a simple yet incredibly effective feature for players with visual impairments, ensuring that dialogue and important information are easily readable. It's a small change with a significant impact, and it's a testament to the developers' commitment to making sure everyone can enjoy the game's narrative without struggle.

The ability to adjust the camera distance is a game-changer for players who may have difficulties focusing on intricate details or need a broader view of the in-game world. Being able to customize the camera sensitivity is equally vital, as it empowers players to fine-tune their control over the game environment. These options provide an exceptional level of control and personalization that can greatly enhance the gaming experience for disabled players and anyone who prefers a more tailored playstyle.",1699121486,1699121486,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was shocked as this was not over the coarse of a day or two but one sitting and the time flew by playing this game. That too me alone shows how fun it is that the time completely flew by. This game is very similar to ""Kingdoms and Castles"" mixed with ""City Skylines"". The differences are in City skylines you are focused more on the layout of certain districts in certain areas, electricity and plumbing. This game is based in the 1800s, you did not have electricity or plumbing. In kingdoms and castles you focus more on your defenses against vikings and then your population. Although in this game there are defenses involved, I have not made it very far into the defenses and so far that is more of a late game development as in Kingdoms and Castles it is more of an entire game and more early game. It is more important in that game. I feel this is more in depth than Kingdoms in Castles similar to how in depth City Skylines is. If you liked either of those games and/or is/are fascinated with the industrial revolution or games set in that era and like city building or management/tycoon type games then this is definitely the game for you.

* Nice graphics and story. If you pause on a building you can listen to the associated worker ramble in their unique voices and perspectives; I love to listen to the farmers, and the especially amusing workers rant (e.g. ""...they can take their shiny little spoon, and SHOVE it!"") LOL
* Original content design, some pleasing gameplay mechanics
* Plays flawlessly on my computer, which is a budget gaming system I built in Nov 2022 including:

 	OS: Windows 11

CONS:

* It's hard! Really hard! I love city-builder games, but this one makes my brain hurt!

After the first 20 hours everything I did began to unravel and I didn't like it. Eventually I was drawn back into it, and moving more cautiously, I completed the tutorial campaign and learned enough to triumph militarily in sandbox play at normal difficulty level. Wondering what I had missed, the next time I avoided a military victory and just played for progression, finding that it gets much harder with each new progression. I've just begun to use engineers and I'm getting simple achievement awards that have so far been awarded to less than 10% of players, and there is at least one more untried progression left (investors) with presumably much fewer awards won. I take that to mean most players have given up by this point, finding it too difficult. I keep finding myself overwhelmed by the complexity at this point, increasingly needing to take a break with less and less accomplished, but I keep coming back.

If you love city-builders and you love a deeply complex sandbox game, I'd gamble that you're going to really appreciate this one. If you're out for something easy-going, uh... (shrug)",1693860879,1698899327,True,0,0,0.5378151535987854,0,True,False,False

Developed by Ubisoft, this game has truly stood the test of time, thanks to continuous support and the addition of exciting new content.

The visuals in Anno 1800 are nothing short of stunning, and the gameplay is incredibly engaging. You'll lose track of time as you delve into the intricacies of managing your burgeoning city. Seeing the series return to Steam is a delight, making it more accessible than ever. The only piece that needs to be added to complete this gaming experience is the addition of achievements, which would undoubtedly add an extra layer of enjoyment.

However, it's essential to acknowledge that some players might have reservations due to Ubisoft's reputation as a publisher. Yet, if you can overlook that, Anno 1800 is a true gem that offers a complex and expansive city-building experience. It's a game you can't help but fall in love with, mainly when you invest a few hours to explore its depths.

Anno 1800 is the most extensive and complex entry in the Anno series, offering hours of entertainment for those who appreciate city-building games. While Ubisoft's involvement might give some pause, the game's content and gameplay make it well worth the investment.

If you're a fan of city management and logistics games, Anno 1800 is a must-play title, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.",1698819104,1698819104,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

It requires two separate launchers,  the Steam game client and the Ubisoft game client called Ubisoft Connect. When you click “Play” on the Steam client, it passes an evoke command to the Ubisoft Connect which launches the game for you and not Steam.  The game will not even start if the Ubisoft Connect isn’t running.  To play  Anno 1800, Ubisoft runs Ubisoft Connect,  5 separate Web-Connect processes, Denuvo Anti-Tamper, and VM Protect DRM software in the background, and requires both a third-party EULA and a 3rd-party  Ubisoft Account.  Ubisoft Connect is like Steam with regards to its functionality and appears to collect similar game data as Steam does tracking your game progress, etc., however after you close the game down and shut down the Steam client, the Ubisoft Connect and its 5 web-connect processes still run in the background collecting data on who knows what and the only way to shut them down is to manually terminate them one at a time within the Windows Task Manager. Steam is just an intermediary here. In addition to this, when I played the game in offline mode, it only permitted me to be offline for about 10 days maximum until it demanded me to go online for no other reason other but for sync my data with the Ubisoft Connect game servers. If you do not go online, the game won’t start at all but is as dead as a brick.   Only after you connect online again will  Ubisoft Connect permit you to play the game. This is not written anywhere that could see before I bought the game. I’ve played other games offline that I bought on Steam for 10+ months in the past, but it appears that Anno 1800 has no 100% offline mode at all. This makes me believe that it's Ubisoft’s brute-force way of forcing us to share our data with them.
I submitted a support ticket to Ubisoft asking them why the Ubisoft client and its processes were running in the background after the game was terminated and the Steam client shut down, and after the 3rd week on the 22nd day, they still have not responded. I then received a generic message from them stating that Ubisoft had not heard back from me and asked if I wanted to close the ticket. I replied on the ticket that I still needed their response to my initial inquiry and later that day I received the same response again stating that they did not hear from me and asked if I wanted to close the ticket again. Their customer service system appears to be designed to delay, defer, and deny helping customers and it appears to be 100% bot-driven because the ticket had no customer service rep name assigned to it. Sorry folks, there are no live human beings overseeing customer support needs but there sure are real people available and ready to help you hand over your hard-earned money for another game purchase. Ubisoft Customer Support service is horrendous at best and by far it is one of the worst experiences I have ever had from a game developer hands down. I will never buy another game from them …. period.
As for Anno 1800, it was very fun and enjoyable most of the time, however after a while I noticed that the game uses various mechanics to divert your attention from managing citizens in an increasing manner through using constant distractions and incident interruptions which evolve into very large time sinks … like 90 minutes or greater of side-tracking from in-game events of:   The AI … “Captain – Captain we need your immediate attention now!!! ”…. then “A fire has erupted in your city”, then a bit later “An explosion has occurred in one of your factories"", then several messages of ...“Your ships are being attacked by pirates”, then several  AI characters in-game asked me to help them on time-sensitive missions and I declined because I was already fixing 5 problems and managing things on the fiancé screen such as supply chains at the current time ...then I get another “Your citizens are rioting in the streets”, then one of the Artisans chimes with an aggravated snarky tone of voice stating that he’s moving out. I then checked why he was moving out and it was because he wanted more rum supplied even though he was well supplied at about 70% of rum on his lifestyle need meter, then on and on the craziness went. The game continually harasses you by generating increasing and repetitive problems even though I had more than enough countermeasures like firehouses, police stations, harbor defenses, etc. So now you get the picture of what the Devs designed in the game as being “fun”?  
After I resolved the plethora of problems, I completely forgot what I was originally working on 90+ minutes beforehand. After another 4+ hours went by the game told me that I needed to take a break and stretch my legs, etc. so I decided to take a permanent break instead. LOL. I don’t mind a few interruptions, however, the increasingly repetitive occurrences of these and other events combined developed in me higher degrees of diminished enjoyment and it ultimately caused me to believe that the game is designed with tedium in mind instead of enjoyment. This caused me to feel burnout and I lost both zeal and desire to play it because my time invested felt unrewarded. 
I tried to like Anno 1800 and get as much out of it as possible, however as I racked more playing hours, I realized that the game is designed to restrict you from having the ability to take a minute to think at all because there is NO ACTIVE PAUSE MODE in the game at all.   Anno 1800 is extremely repetitious. It forces you to rebuild the same settlements on different islands but they look different and have different needs, however, if you build one house of each citizen tier in the game, you have seen them all. I like the blueprint methodology; however, it doesn’t work well because islands are shaped differently and many do not have appropriate land space to accommodate your blueprint designs.
The reason why I finally put the game down besides what I stated above is that there is a problem within the finance data where I discovered that citizen lifestyle needs (demand) aren’t included in the overall population demand calculation even after 6 hours of playing later in the day. This causes overall demand (consumption) to be understated when looking at the specific citizen tier and also overstates the supply thus they aren’t in true equilibrium per the fiancé screen data.  This caused me to make manual notes outside of the game to keep track of specific production rates for specific goods with the affected citizen classes with notes of my rationale for each. This game was released in 2019 and it's still not fixed. The devs should’ve corrected it in the first place. 
What this game comes down to is how well you manage your cities to generate the highest rate of coins per minute at the lowest total maintenance cost.  If you do not have 100% accurate finance data you’re automatically exposed to have weaknesses in fiduciary management which the game A.I. takes advantage of very well. The finance screen is not perfect and I get it, however, it annoyed me that it hasn’t been fixed since the game was released. I had well over 7,500 people at various levels under my management therefore I needed accurate data... period. That isn’t a lot to ask for. 
--- TL: DR ---

- Too many different worlds combined into one playthrough. You need different kinds of goods from each continent. I think there's ""too much"" to do, so this can be a drawback if you're not ready to invest some real hours into the game.

- The Ubisoft launcher: There is a lot of fuss about Ubisoft's third-party launcher. It hasn't caused any trouble for me and is nothing to be concerned about. However, for some players, it might cause some problems (e.g., game crashing).

- You need all of the content DLCs to play, or at least that is my opinion. I bought the Anno Year 4 Complete Edition when it was -50% off. I've found it very useful for gameplay.

Add to that some long, complex production chains and a few AI players to compete against yourself all in real time and you've got an ANNO game. Perhaps the most important thing to know about this series is that you can PAUSE the game but you can't do anything while it is paused.

If you're completely new to the ANNO franchise, I guess you could start here as it's the very best one and it has some excellent tools to help you to manage the economy of all your islands. However, if you want to dip your toe in and see if managing such a big game in real time is to your taste without splurging out a lot of cash, ANNO 1404 is the 2nd best in the series and simpler to manage. This one comes with quite a list of DLC but don't worry about any of them at the moment as you won't need any of them for a while.

if you're new to ANNO, you should play the campaign once. It takes about 14 hours to complete the campaign once you've figured out how to manage your economies and set up trade routes between the old and new worlds. The campaign serves as a tutorial but it leaves you a lot to figure out so you should learn to use the statistics pages and consult them frequently. here you can find how much of any product your island needs (the blue bar) and the amount that your island is producing  (the green bar). Use these to tell at a glance whether you need to build more production buildings  ar see how much of a surplus you're producing. Once you're accustomed to looking at these, you'll feel much more comfortable managing the supply chains on several islands.

Learn to set up passive trading at your ports so that your production buildings are not idle because your warehouses are full. Learn to set up trade routes between your islands so that you don't need to produce everything everywhere.

And that's the base game campaign. You don't need ANY DLC to enjoy this. In fact, it's better not to have any of it as you will get quests to do things and you might end up makinbg your game far too complicated to manage. You also won't need to manage any more than artisans to win it. In fact, it finishes quite early compared to a full game. Then you can move onto your first sandbox game and again, you don't need any DLC here. The campaign is quite frenetic at times and the sandbox is more relaxed by comparison. You take on quests when you have the time to deal with them and perhaps play on SLOW until you're comfortable managing the pace.

Once you feel comfortable managing the base game, then you can start to think about adding the new regions. But that's already about another 30+ hours anyway, probably a lot more as it's quite a lot to manage and you'll likely restart a couple of times before you're happy. The game is a long one and your cities can grow very large as the game progresses. By this time, you should have learned how to move existing structures around and manage the limited space on your island more effectively.

Much of the DLC serves to flesh out the late game anyway and the good news is that when you buy a new DLC, you will be asked if you want to activate it in your current playthrough - this is a one-time offer so if you say 'no'. you'll need to start a new game to use the DLC content.",1695543588,1695543588,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is what matters though and if you filter out all those anti-Ubisoft reviews (and I'm sure they're all justified just based on Ubi's track record), you'd be left with an Overwhelmingly Positively reviewed game and I think that's what the game itself deserves. 

I never got into the whole Anno series, so this was my first proper contact with it and I feel like I've been missing out. The whole naval system with the technology progression and even the personalities of your opponents gripped me right from the start and now that I've finished the campaign, I'm happily continuing to play the same save, because I love how everything progresses and I really enjoy taking care of multiple colonies and trading between them and commiting war crimes and improving my population's productivity with propaganda and showing pirates that two can play the pillaging game.

The one gripe I have with the resource trading system is how ships are a bit dumb sometimes and they will pass by a hostile island and get shredded to pieces by cannons and I couldn't find any way to modify the trading route trajectory to avoid enemies. It sounds like a minor issue, but it really makes trading in late game very difficult. I don't really like how no matter how big your island is, you will eventually run out of space, which forces you into getting resources from other islands and worlds and then you run into that whole dumb straight routes issue all over again. I would also like the diplomacy to be a little bit more lenient, because Fatty McFatpants will just always hate my guts no matter how many doubloons I shove down her cleavage, but that's not a major issue, I love covering my hands in flapsweat.

The game is also gorgeous. From what I've seen of the rest of the series, this is nothing new for Anno as all the other games looked fantastic for their respective ages. That is if we discount that weird bloom phase the gaming industry went through around 2005, when our screens looked like they had vaseline smeared all over them.

Anyway, great game, can't wait to explore the rest of this series, starting with 2070, which I need to de-bloom first.",1695133367,1695133367,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the other hand it's never too much content to overwhelm you. All production chains are nicely illustrated and the game gives all the detail about a production chains performance.

I have decided to switch to not recommend. Of course your experience will vary depending on what your looking for
I found after 13 hours, there was WAYY too much management for me between all the islands, the supplies and trading required between each one, and how necessary expantion is. I really found myself asking, cant i just focus on my one main island?
I would love to be able to turn off the second map you get and have to utilize.

It's an intricate tapestry of economic management, architectural finesse, and geopolitical maneuvering. That said, it isn't perfect, and a couple of minor drawbacks stop it from reaching celestial heights.

🏗️ Building Mechanics

The building mechanics are a joy. There's an almost tactile satisfaction in seeing your fledgling village transform into a sprawling metropolis. The game brilliantly interweaves complexity and user-friendliness, making every zoning decision feel meaningful yet not overwhelmingly intricate.

🗺️ World & Exploration

The immersive world of ANNO 1800 steals the show. The islands are beautifully designed, with each possessing its unique flora, fauna, and resources. However, this leads to my first gripe: island RNG can sometimes be a bit frustrating, especially for newcomers. But then again, it adds to the replay value, as no two games are ever the same!

💡 Strategy & Decision Making

Here's where the game shines the brightest. The choices you make ripple through your empire in ways both subtle and profound. Be prepared to face the consequences of your actions, whether you choose to be a conservationist or an industrial powerhouse.

🎨 Graphics & Aesthetics

From the detailed edifices to the sparkling sea, everything looks vibrant and inviting. The soundtrack deserves special mention for perfectly capturing the zeitgeist of the 19th-century industrial era. A minor issue, though, is that the UI can sometimes feel a bit clunky, especially when managing complex trade routes. But, this is something you'll get used to over time.

🤝 Multiplayer

Multiplayer is engaging and fun but be warned: the game's pacing isn't for everyone. If you're in for a quick match, you might be disappointed. ANNO 1800 is a marathon, not a sprint, which to me is more of a feature than a bug.

👍 The Community & Mods

Before I wrap up, I want to give a shout-out to the fantastic community and the mod support that keeps the game fresh.

📝 Conclusion

ANNO 1800 is a masterclass in how city-building and strategy can be perfectly blended into a single, compelling experience. It does have minor issues like unpredictable island RNG and a somewhat clunky UI, but these are dwarfed by its many virtues.

Favorite Feature: The dynamic economy that keeps you on your toes.
Least Favorite: The somewhat RNG-dependent island generation.

If you're a fan of strategy games or city builders—or if you're new and intrigued—do yourself a favor and give ANNO 1800 a spin. Trust me, you'll find yourself saying ""just one more turn"" more often than you'd like to admit!",1693056713,1693056713,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great OST, great additions to the classic Anno's gameplay formula, the opponent and neutral NPCs are all extremely charming and have great dialogue, the game's artists and animators went the extra mile to make the cities and its buildings feel lived in, thanks to a ton of unique animations and assets for things the player will rarely look at for more than a few seconds.

Some downsides though, the music might be good but the music player isn't, sticking to repetition of specific tracks despite there being a huge variety of music that only gets unlocked at certain stages for no good reason. The UI could use some work, I don't mind multiplying my Supply and Demand by the Docklands time tables but it's a bit of a time waster that this isn't automated. DLC is generally nice but the Anarchist DLC feels pretty tacked on and is entirely pointless. Opponent NPCs don't have consistent trade offers either, so creating trade routes with them is very unreliable and pointless, making their presence in a sandbox run kinda pointless unless you want to shoot at other ships.

- [strike]Add Steam Achievements. Ubisoft could add achievements easily, they already exist for the Ubisoft launcher.[/strike] EDIT: Steam Achievements were added.

- Better and more stable cloud synchronisation with Ubisoft Connect. Sometimes it doesn't work well which is pretty annoying when you can't start anno just because of the ubisoft launcher (a PC restart often helps with this issue but sometimes you need to wait a while until the ubisoft cloud connection works). You also need the ubisoft launcher to play this game, can't play with Steam only. It's a bit annoying but nothing new with Ubisoft games, at least the game is available on Steam.

Another thing I like about Anno 1800 is its trading system. In the game, you can trade with other countries to get the resources you need. Trading can be very challenging, because you have to compete with other countries to get scarce resources.

Overall, I really like Anno 1800. The game is a very interesting and challenging city-building simulation game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes city-building simulation games, strategy, and economics.

Anno is a great city builder game with sooo many details.
You manage many islands instead of one huge city or you can 
manage just some big ones all up to you along with many other 
possibilities you can do along with ship stuff like trading ect.
Anno 1800 also has multiplayer up to 16 people! (4 players per team)

The GUI doesn't live up to aaaaaaalllllll the work that has to be doooooone to maintain / expand those islands, supply chains, worker's happiness, trades, diplomacy, etc.... This game is multi-tasking on steroids, AGGRAVATED by poor GUI.

- You often have to load a full screen report in order to properly assess mismatches in supply/demand of goods.
- You must rely on an inefficient menu to influence worker happiness (via work conditions), which is a key gameplay element.
- The main HUD *should* have a customizable overlay that allows you to track a lot of different metrics, but no.
- There is no MODS in the GUI category.

Getting better at this game means knowing what ENDLESS STREAM OF TASKS you have to go through to be as efficient as your knowledge allows... But once you realize that you'll always be stuck with that shitty GUI... well, in my case, I stopped playing.

Anno 1800 rockt den PC und ist dabei wie ein gut gereifter Wein – es wird immer besser! Die Entwickler haben sich selbst übertroffen und erschufen mit den unzähligen DLCs ein Meisterwerk an Simulation. Die Mischung aus Stadtmanagement, Ressourcenwahn und kleinteiliger Selbstoptimierung ist süchtig machend. Wenn sich die Freunde schon fragen, ob man eine ""Schlafstörung"" hat, keine Sorge: ""Nur einen Moment noch, nur das eine noch eben fertig bauen"". Anno 1800 ist definitiv ein historisch-geniales Meisterwerk! Ich sags ja nur selten, aber: Danke Ubisoft.",1691066721,1691101034,True,7,0,0.499526679515838623,3,True,False,False

In terms of the actual game, then in my opinion it is very good.  Sure the requirement to buy more and more DLC is always annoying, but strip the game back to it's core, plus one or two additions and it's very enjoyable.

I'm halfway through the campaign and am basing my assessment on the campaign only.  Nice balance of challenge/progression and a nice story.

So far I believe the game is worth it's money just based on this.  Anything extra would be a bonus.

Maybe I was spoiled growing up with games, Warcraft 1,2 and 3. Strong story elements that pulled you into the narrative to complete the objectives given and slowly yet surely add more complex elements into the game and have it story based during this time.
For example:
Start with footmen then story comes by with the new element of archer class, Elves are trapped by orcs so rescue elves to get the Elf lumber mill to produce next tier units.
Games in this generation are like:
Here is a story, its half baked like the creators of it. No actually thought process into game development just rise up and ya enjoy nothingness mindset seems to be the going rate for games.
Games like the Last of Us are so incredibly rare, deep story enriching atmosphere and adaptation of tiers in equipment each tier serving a purpose of the new challenge given in the story.
What does this have to do with Anno?
Anno is built very much on the former mindset, half baked concept and thousands of gamers being stoned most likely themselves saying 'dude this is so cool' no man its not, everything in the game is neither thought provoking or indepth, and completely shallow.

[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]
If you like any real-time city builder, do yourself a favor, forget this was published by Ubisoft, and buy Anno 1800. It's probably one of the best out there and it has so much content that you'll probably get bored before seeing it all. 

👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]
+Amazing attention to detail
+Relaxing and complex building mechanics
+Cool soundtrack

👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]
-Will get overwhelmed with how much content it has
-Campaign is mostly a big tutorial

[h1]Story[/h1]
There isn't much to talk about here, the campaign is pretty much a big introduction to game mechanics and after it ends you continue on the same map(s) which was a pretty good idea. 

As for the story of the campaign, you get invited by your sister to come home, due to some problems with your father, you arrive, things happen, and now you have an island to take care of and deal with your uncle being an asshole. 

Not much else can be said about it, you obviously won't play Anno for the writing or the characters, but they did try to make a decent story so I'll have to rate it accordingly. 

Story rating: 6/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Anno 1800 is a city builder that focuses a lot on the economy, and your citizens among other things. If you're not a fan of the combat in RTS games, then you can play this game safely as you can avoid combat 90% of the time by either game settings or allying with the AI or pirates in the game. If you do wish to have combat, it's all at sea and it only starts halfway in the game when you can afford to build them. 

Anno 1800 when it comes to gameplay it can be very relaxing and time-consuming while also overwhelming you as your city, economy, and people grow. It's not just a simple, build your buildings and that is it. Each house grows in its inhabitants and they all have needs that you must fulfill in order for that specific house to keep growing. Once it has reached a certain point they can get upgraded to the next level of citizenship. That, in turn, means, you lose the previous type of workers and you have to keep building more and more, and as your city grows, so do the needs. It's a constant battle to maintain demands while also having a positive income, mostly because every manufacturing building has costs that drop your income significantly. These costs are money and worker-wise. You can't just spam sheep farmers if you do not have enough farm-level citizens or enough income. 

It only gets better from there or worse depending on your view, as your city evolves the game then opens up with shipbuilding and capturing other islands. You'll have to then build a lot of ships to gather resources that are not available on your main island and move them from your secondary islands. Ships also cost income, and you'll also have to take care of the people on the other island as well. And just when you finally managed to have a positive and on-rails economy, the game opens up even more through expeditions where you have to build a ship, fill it up with resources and start a voyage to unknown lands. Once you reach these lands, such as the Arctic, you're going to have to build a settlement there as well which has its own unique mechanics and buildings. Congratulations, now you have to deal with even more cities. 

Anno 1800 does offer you the chance to play with friends either by controlling the same city or you can be two players as allies. You can probably spend 100 hours alone playing the game and reaching the point of nothing else to do, which may get boring for some due to the amount of content. 


Gameplay rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Audio design wise it's pretty great. Every building, every part of your city as it grows has its own unique sounds, the more your scroll down the more you hear your people roaming the city, going to work, dorks barking, etc. 

The soundtrack is pretty good as well, each region has its own unique set of songs that fit perfectly well with the atmosphere. As for the voice acting, it's okay, nothing really out of the ordinary, not good but not bad either. 

Audio rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
Tech-wise I'm in awe of how much detail Anno 1800 has. The game is a technical marvel, every building has its own unique look, actual people roam the city as it grows, they go to their jobs, etc. Texture detail, atmosphere, water details, everything is absolutely top-notch. 

That being said, all these amazing details come at a cost as the game is very demanding in hardware. A shame it never got updated with DLSS because Ubisoft won't allow them to due to its partnership with AMD. It has FSR, but it's the 1.0 version which is a blurry pos. 

As for bugs and other problems, the game is surprisingly free of them. 

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 9/10

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you want a fantastic city-builder that focuses a lot on its citizens and economy with tons of hours of content then there's no reason not to play Anno 1800. Visually the game is one, if not the best-looking RTS ever made.

The production chains work well and are varied. They also intertwine with the other continents that you are playing on really well, so that you have to manage them across long routes and with appropriate escorts.
It leaves many options in optimizing and minmaxing all the resources. You get buildings that give aura boost in a radius to specific building types depending on the items you put in there. That in turn, forces you to think about how you optimize these auras for maximum efficiency. Or you can import and export resources to make money or shortcut some production chains.
One negative part for me was that, since I bought the game with all the DLCs, you get at some point way too many islands to manage. If you want to play efficiently, without looking up guides, you will have to constantly switch between continents as to not bottleneck your progress. This makes for more varied gameplay and a lot more content, but sometimes feels like a chore when you would rather focus on one, maybe two, continents.

I definitely recommend this game, but only without the DLCs. The DLCs themselves are really good, but the game is worth its money even without them. Once you're confident in the main game, you should branch out and get the DLCs",1690232236,1690232236,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly, i was bored of Cities Skylines and various games like these, but stumbling across this on the sale, i literally cannot put it down. 

GRAPHICS - 9/10 (understandable considering the type of game but was surprised with the level of detail) 
GAMEPLAY - 10/10 (honestly, theres so much to do and manage and so many ways to progress, literally the world is your oyster with this game, can tough it out and really fight to ""git gud"" or you can slow everything right down and play is your spare time for hours and make things aesthetic) 

Havent had a single bug happen to me on this game yet, i know there was a bug regarding ubisoft signing you out every time you load the game but this has never happened to me. 

The characters pop up every now and then with some hilarious one liners which do make you chuckle...

A few points:
-This is a strategy city-building sim a la Frostpunk with mini-games and storytelling similar to Crusader Kings III. If you're looking for something like Cities Skylines, this isn't for you. 
-Base game has more than enough content to make the $60+ price tag worth it, and I won't hesitate to buy DLC as I continue to play. (So, value for money is excellent.)
-There is a sandbox mode, but I haven't tried it yet, so I can't comment on it. 
-The learning curve it steep. The lowest difficulty option on campaign mode is ""normal,"" and even with the game selected to give me more help, mechanics aren't necessarily straight-forward.

The art style is charming and the sound atmospheric. It really feels like you've stepped back in time to be a captain of industry trying to develop your own island to take on a corrupt uncle and the challenges of its old Victorian day.

Unfortunately the controls are a little hard to pick up at first and its lack of a save scumming feature often means that one mistake usually means a catastrophic cascade failure that renders the art and atmosphere moot because if you actually want to win you are going to be going over spread sheets and planning optimization calculations instead enjoying the game.

While somewhat narrative driven, the fact that there seems to be only one strategy acceptable (play tall and slowly) means that its less a game and more like filling out a form.

Got it for 75% discount and even then it feels like a rip off.

It was probably pretty good for its time but now the lack of flexibility, and slow, meandering play style left me wondering why I didn't just take up gardening instead,

When there was only season 1, this was not as bad as it is now. Its a clusterfuck of multitasking.

In the end, the game is pretty easy and forgiving even in higher difficulty settings. You have enough time to manage everything, it just feels like you are chasing your own tail. Also, I was already experienced with the base game before having all the DLCs active. For a new player this might be very daunting at first.

It should be pointed out, that there are - a lot - of settings one can choose to fit their own playstyle, so having a lot of stuff to do is not necessarily a bad thing. You are free to deactivate every DLC and basically go into sandbox/creative mode if you want to.

Having only played the first season back in the days, I like a lot of their recent additions.
- You now have stamps to copy and paste your building layouts (think of Blueprints in Factorio)
- there is a sandbox/creative mode now
- you can now move multiple buildings at once
- completely reworked and better construction menu
- completely reworked a lot of summary and information screens
- a lot of (better) info tooltips and new notifications
- lifestyle needs
- production statistics are now crystal clear
[...]

The list of additions is huge.
There is a ton of new items and balancing changes as well.

The base game was already very good and everything I wanted from a new Anno game. Still, they try to improve it in every area. Pricing is absolutely fair, considering that you can get the visionary edition with all the season updates for around 50$.

This is how a game should be supported.

The problem I quickly ran into is that as a city builder, the games feel very limited. Only certain islands are large enough to support an actual city and like a lot of people have pointed out on YT, crown falls is really your only option but it also forces you into basically the same city everyone else makes. 

The ""adventure"" part of the game where you go on quests to find items is a cool idea but got old fast. For the first few quests I did, I read every part and took time to make the right decisions, but eventually, I just clicked through and was still able to achieve all the same outcomes.

Just big MEH.

The curve of learning is: you can veeeery easily put up a large settlement, and the actual end game tweaks are the ""difficult"" part.

The quests seemed stupid, like do I look like i want to do puzzles? No, I bought an Anno -game

True Anno experience is you sitting on your sweaty butt staring at the lumberjack walking into the woods, so that the wheelbarrow person can haul it to your storage yard, so that you can finally build the 5th building in your crappy settlement, and after decades of hard work, you actually have a QUARRY, etc. Instead of, this, whatever this is, a bad 3D graphics show of something wet and cold; it's like a bad handshake, you just want it to end and go wash your hands.

Since the start of the series its always been about relaxing, chill and fun gameplay. Build to your hearts desire, trade, explore and do so much more.

Anno 1800 is a wonderful return to the old school settings that the series was known for back in the day, before the futuristic ones. I still liked the ones in the future, but something about these Anno games in the older settings that is so much better to me atleast.

First off this new offering is the best in the series since 1404 (Dawn of Discovery), wonderful gameplay, gorgeous graphics, fantastic expansion packs and years later, the game runs great to, this is a must buy for any fan of PC gaming or City Builders.

One of the best PC games of the last 10 years in my opinion and one that I keep coming back to every 6 months or so to play more of. I am glad they brought it back on Steam to!

Relaxing music, chill gameplay, a very high fun factor and some of the best replayability of any game around. In between other big releases you will come back to this game to enjoy its relaxing gameplay.

This series for me is all about the Sandbox mode, super fun in solo play and also great fun with a friend to. Whatever way you want to play Anno 1800, you will be rewarded with one of the best PC games of all time. 

I can't wait to see what these devs do next, they literally are the only reason I buy anything  published by Ubisoft these days.

Best city builder and imo best strategy series around and still at the top of its game with this latest entry.

Just make sure you keep an eye on the clock with this game and series, time will fly by as you are building and trading, it really pulls you in well with its gameplay and immersion!",1688409292,1688409465,True,29,0,0.751169323921203613,0,True,False,False

so far i'm not a fan. the beginning quest forced me to blow up fish (which sorry i wasn't really into and wasn't expecting in a city-builder wtf) and there was absolutely no tutorial despite my tutorial setting being on. embarrassingly and frustratingly i had to look up online how to even play, like what to press and everything!! i couldn't even move my boat or pick up the damn fish at the beginning. why does something so simple and basic have to be so frustrating? it is not intuitive in any way!! also, the story feels meh and worst of all, there is no active pause in this game unlike pretty much every city builder. wanna pause and assess what's needed and do some building before some other shit happens? nope, can't do that here. nope, pausing here does not pause time, it pauses the actual game :-(

you have three speed options: slow, normal and fast. slow and fast are barely different from normal. 
also, maybe i'm wrong here, but it seems too that the little people populating your city are just decorative unlike in games such as Frostpunk (highly recommended), Banished or even Surviving Mars (which is also meh)--not a deal breaker for me, but if those games could do it...
going to the control settings and seeing everything there actually made me mad. it's like, dudes....too much! too overwhelming!
this is all really unfortunate because the graphics are lovely.

if you're looking for a more relaxing city builder to play, try pretty much anything other than this (and surviving mars)
i bought it on sale so i'll keep it and maybe attempt to get into it later, but for now this game kiiiinda fvcking sucks. 

 will update if i give this a more thorough go.

also, is this supposed to be 1800? looks more like late 1800s, especially the clothing is way off! more like Anno 1890. really, this game should have just been called Anno 1900, and i'm really not sure why it's not.",1688305510,1688399248,False,2,1,0.533073961734771729,0,True,False,False

This is the first Anno game I've tried, and it's a nice blend of city building and resource chains, with a dash of competition and conflict thrown in.  The campaign has a decent story and does a great job walking a new player through a good portion of the base game progression.  When creating a game you have a lot of control over the aggressiveness of the AIs.  Dial it up if you want lots of competition, or select easy opponents and disable the pirates if you just want to chill and build your islands.

The various gameplay DLC packs add a lot of new elements (new regions, resources, buildings, etc).  None of them feel essential to me, but quite a few are nice to have, and I can see how they would add a lot of variety in future replays.  These DLC packs are grouped in sets of three as season passes.  Roughly speaking, if you want two of the three, then the corresponding season pass gives you the third pack for free.  Similarly, if you want three of the four season passes, then you should consider buying the Complete Edition instead of the base game.

Ubisoft Connect is trash.  It needs to connect back to Ubisoft servers before it will run the game, which seems to fail about half the time.  Even when it works perfectly it adds about 20 seconds to starting the game.  It adds no value that I can see.  I don't care about syncing my achievements or finding other players online (and if I did, then Steam has already solved those problems in a much less intrusive manner).

However I still don't really trust Ubisoft. This game requires uPlay and an internet connection for singleplayer, I still need some kind of Ubisoft account to just play the game despite buying it with a Steam account. I guess I should just be grateful that Ubisoft allowed Steam achievements.

It felt so unrealistic. Why not the on the inhabited continent? It is the Old World, right? Then why are we aren't in Europe (map-wise)? For uninhabited islands, there is the New World. - Also don't like that all the islands look the same.
Another thing I didn't like from the start are the Campaign character creation - you can only choose from avatars who are already existing characters in the Campaign - at some point, you will meet your own doppelganger.
I also don't like the main concept of 'production chains', how they work in the game - I don't know, I feel that they should work differently.
The reason I give up the game now eventually is a kind of income bug. I didn't have this problem in my first Campaign but I started a new one, and no matter how well I prosper (always in the black), many times I suddenly lose huge amounts of money, I mean, about 80 % of my whole budget. I also noticed that some quests, when I successfully finished them, didn't pay me the promised 4400 golds, but substracted from me - the reward is a negative income, not positive. You give up all the hard work on an economy when you notice that some bug instantly substracts your profit.",1687705500,1687705500,False,3,0,0.485172957181930542,0,True,False,False

Pros:
1. The campaign is pretty smooth, makes sense, and encourages an appropirate progression in the game.

2. For a city builders the graphics are fantastic and I really enjoy watching my citizens interact with things I place, such as parks and amusements. 

3. The import / export system is very well thought out and makes the establishment of more advanced cities possible. 

4. The colonies part can be a little stressful at first because often your competitors expand quicker than you do, but thats an easily fixable problem with a few battleships.

5. The economy is very well done and balances well!

6. The workshop is absolutely fantastic! 

cons:

1. The African expansion is dumb, obnoxious, and I would avoid it if I could. Usually I just skip the quest line and just build a few colonies for resources without building any worthwhile city. 

2. The special quests are challenging, but its dumb how worthless the rewards are..... 

3. There is a a bit of racial / environmentalist wokism that is a bit nauseating, but isnt to overwhelming.  

Conclusion:


As a whole this game is fun but challenging. This may be one of the best city builder games ive played and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys city builder games.",1679426051,1686244597,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are also many more options than i thought they'd be in terms of things to build and the sea battles are awesome! Thoroughly recommend it if you like city building games.

Edit: The link between Ubisoft Connect and Steam is dodgy AF and causes the game to constantly fail to synchronise. If this happens, it is likely because Ubisoft has logged itself out without telling you, click on the logout button then log back in and sometimes it is ok, if not then kill Steam and Ubisoft in the task manager or just restart your PC. Lesson learned, never buy games made by Ubisoft through Steam",1673261705,1684918661,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Story is alright, campaign mode does a good job teaching the basic game-play mechanics. Victorian era visual design is really well done from agriculture up to steam ships/electricity and stuff.

- Economics aren't too complex but detailed enough that you still need to pay attention.

- Fun to replay and do different city layouts if you're in to efficiency design and stuff.

- Naval fleet battles are fun to play.  

- Haven't explored multiplayer or any DLC yet, but will soon.  Having 20+ DLC packs priced $5-$15 each is a little disappointing IMO, but I suppose some players like having more small choices for extra content to choose... Too each their own.

I dont see how one can publish things like that as a final version. It should not be bought. Also without DLC the game is not much more than Anno1701. And the DLC are pretty expensive. This is a very bad move. In my opinion the game should be somewhat complete on release.

[9/10] The best ANNO game in the series I have played thus far. They did a really good job with this one.

FUN TO PLAY
[9/10] The game can be as relaxed or as fast paced as you want. One moment you're planting flowers in a village, and the next you're making decisions that affect how a naval expedition will turn out.  Or perhaps you're revising the newspaper with 'alternative facts' to distract your populace, while you wage war on a competitor.  All of the different layers of the game keep it interesting and fresh.

INTUITIVE INTERFACE & MECHANICS
[8/9] At this point, Anno's interface has become pretty polished, and players know what to expect. It can be a lot for new players, but there are many enhancements to please advanced players.

MUSIC & SOUND
[8/9] Sound effects are high quality and very well done.  Soundtrack is enjoyable, but would like there to be more music tracks for less repetition.  Most dialogues have voice lines, which is always a plus.

VISUALLY APPEALING
[10/9] Beautiful and colorful, the art appropriately captures the period's sense of wonder and hope for a brighter future.

IMMERSION
[8/9] It's a real treat to zoom into your city -- the sights and sounds of a rural village, an industrial district, a bustling city, all make the world feel vibrant and alive.  Most other games don't have this level of detail. After all the hard work that you put into the game, it's nice to just sit back and revel in what you've created.",1684812200,1684812200,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I played this game a lot before it came to Steam and I've thoroughly enjoyed learning about and interacting with all the mechanics of the game.

[hr][/hr]

Anno is a unique city building game in that it offers more than just raw city building. There are elements of military strategy, exploration, and story/quest lines that set this game apart from other genres. Ubisoft does a really good job at combining all these complex systems into one cohesive and immersive experience. 

In all the games of Anno 1800 I've played, the AI generally keeps pace with you and the difficulty settings you have them on. They may surpass your technology level, for example, but other aspects of their empire are usually behind to keep the balance. I enjoyed that as it provided a casual learning experience for me. If I wanted to focus on exploration for a while, I could do that without the fearing that I'm wasting time while the AI surpasses me.

There were a couple of things I didn't like about the AI, though. The first is that they don't really need resources or the same amount of land as you need in order to progress. While you're finding yourself building bustling cities on your supporting islands to support your main island, the AI only needs a few houses or a single supply chain to support their entire empire. This is probably an optimization choice by Ubisoft, and since most of the competitive warfare usually happens in the water anyways, they may have saw it as unnecessary to render complex cities for each island. In that regard, it makes sense, on the other hand...

It was a bit annoying when I found myself spending hours to overcome a logistical challenge only to find the AI is 4 levels ahead of me with 1/10 the footprint. I felt like, no matter what I did or how fast I did it, the AI would always be right there with me. I could try to create complex logistic networks to keep my industries going or even go on the offense and blockade an AI's ports, but it doesn't matter since they don't follow the same rules as you. Their difficulty setting is the ultimate factor for how they keep pace, not your actions in the game.

I often found myself running into a cliff before I could progress my cities to later stages. I still haven't overcome that even after perfectly optimizing my supply chains and city layouts. I either run out of room, have no way to acquire more of a certain resource, or get demotivated when I have to build another massive city on another island just so I can get one more resource into my supply chain.

There are many different continents, cultures, and topographies to play in which adds a lot of variety in a single play through. On the other hand, having to manage logistics between continents gets very cumbersome after you've done it once or twice. In mid-late game, it starts to eat up most of your time.

The visuals for the game are really good. With all the regions to play in, I often found myself just enjoying the views of my city islands. There's also a really cool mini-game where you can run around your city in first-person. It provides a unique way to experience your cities from the street level.

Overall this is a very enjoyable game if you like complexity and variety. Though the game play loop of having to create yet another island city to support your ever-growing logistics network does get stale after a while, it's very well balanced to allow you to play however you want and at whatever pace you desire.",1684522360,1684522375,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

One of my favorite games of the past few years, and the kind of game that I start up at 10am on a weekend morning and play through until 2... in the morning.

You start off with a tiny island settlement with farmers and eventually end up with a world-spanning economic powerhouse. Without DLC, you’re playing on two maps each with a unique tech tree, and with all the main DLC, you’re playing five maps at the same time, four of which are unique, and one that is destined to be your capital region, with the same tech and residents as the starting zone.

It’s really difficult to encapsulate the game without going off on long tangents, but if you’ve never played an Anno game before, the base game is way more than enough content to keep you occupied for hours. If you end up staying up late for a few weekends in a row, wait for a major sale and grab all the DLC at once to suddenly enter absolute city-building bliss.

Anno is about trade, constructing goods to fulfill the needs of your residents, island expansion, a lot of boats, and a bit of military fighting if you’re up for it. Anno gives you a ton of options to customize your game, and it’s worth spending some time tuning the settings to what you enjoy because a single save on Anno 1800 can end up lasting hundreds of hours.

Also this is assuming you can look passed the whole Ubisoft connect thing ( i know, we all hate it, but if you can just kinda pretend it isn't there, you're in for a good time)

The good:
Lovely soundtrack.
Looks great.
Runs smoothly.
can be a really relaxing experience ( vs easier AI or no AI) 
Starts of slow, but the more islands and regions you build the more complex it becomes.
can play co-op with a friend and build up the same islands together which is nice. 
can be as challenging or as chilled as you like (based on difficulty and number of AI)
Stamps are now in the game which is nice (basically you can create templates which greatly increase the speed at which you can place down a design for infrastructure)

The Bad: 
Combat is really not amazing, and seems to be a bit of an after thought, the AI build so many defences that you would need a large fleet to take them out and that is going to take a loooong time before you can get there. Plus as soon as you or an AI declares war, your trade network just gets obliterated as they pass by enemy islands on their merry (and doomed) way. So for me at least that kind of forces the buy them out route, but good that this is at least an option i guess.

The balancing of resources using the in game statistics although not terrible is not the most informative, using some basic maths the closest you're going to get to figuring out how much you need to send/import to different islands is an educated guess. 

The campaign isn't the best as the story is kinda meh, but you don't play it for the story really.



Overall: if you like tropico/cities skylines type games, you will most likely love this.
Edit:
I would possibly recommend playing the base game first both to see how you like it without spending too much, and not to overwhelm yourself with content. if you like the base game start introducing season packs as suits you.",1683835934,1683836132,True,30,0,0.724123358726501465,0,True,False,False

I was very impressed with the complexity of some of the DLC quests, although I unwittingly failed a few which made me sad. 

Making trade routes and making them efficient is very fun. 

Perhaps my main complaint is the repetition of missions and repetition of expeditions. It is also very time-consuming to unlock all the different items you'd want. It's tough to retain interest once you get into the tens of thousands of population and have most of the final things unlocked, but thankfully there are achievements.

I am really happy that people will finally be able to enjoy this game on their preferred storefront. I don't care much about EGS Exclusives anymore but man I really do hate Ubisoft for pulling this stunt and in-general but at least I can enjoy Anno. 

I do think Ubisoft is doing a really horrible job with their PC Community by dividing it into exclusive deals which shouldn't, even though I don't have a problem with games being on Epic as long as they're on Steam, so everybody can enjoy. I pre-ordered the game because I know it's good and it has potential of being a good Anno game. I saw gameplay a few months back and I really wanted to enjoy it, so I am. But I feel like I don't even wanna buy another Ubisoft game on PC EVER AGAIN because of how $hitt_y their practices are. I do recommend this game but just buy it on Uplay, I also hope it will get re-release on Steam in the future but as of now people have to suffer. I pre-ordered the game back in February 7th, and it was like a few weeks before they announced it was gonna be an Epic Games Store exclusive and IT WAS DURING THE LAST SECOND LIKE WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? DONT BECOME LIKE METRO EXODUS

The game actually redeems itself from previous Anno titles such as 2205 (Which was a mess) but anyway 1800 brings something new and is actually a bit more superior, colonizing other worlds is an option, bringing the industrial revolution is a big role in this game. It's a bit more in-depth from previous other titles, and more user-friendly for newcomers of the Anno series. The only thing I kinda wish is to establish laws in your colony or colonies and have it a bit political which could give it immersion.


Anyway like I said, I recommend the game.

I have tried many times to start playing Anno, but always got stuck. Finally, I bought the latest 1800 version with all the DLCs and got immersed in a couple of days of gameplay. I thought it would be similar to Caesar or Pharaoh, where you just have to try to maximize the building space to fit everything and make it work, like playing Tetris, but it's actually complex and interesting. Moreover, I've already lost the campaign twice due to a lack of money. It's cool when a game challenges you at the level of economics, which is rare nowadays. I don't regret the money spent, as the game has a lot of content, everything is beautiful, polished, well-made, and complex. The only downside is the high pace of the game, similar to Europa Universalis if you know what I mean, when you stand up after 8 hours of playing and can't even comprehend where you are, but fortunately, this side effect is not too pronounced here.

Foreword: The Devs are excellent but the publisher is not. Glad to see it coming back to a proper storefront but it's still hobbled by the UbiConnect launcher which is unstable at the best of times. 

Anno 1800 is an excellent return to form for the team behind the Anno series. It's taken all the prior features and breakthroughs into one robust title. With 4 years of development there is a literal tonne of content here, so much to wrap your head around and plenty to tinker with.  

The main premise of the game is the closing days of the Age of Sail and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution to what is the  early 20th century. You can make some amazing cities, with plenty of decorations to spice up your layouts. Not to mention the plethora of mods that will also enhance your game.

You have multiple sessions (maps) you can expand to and each has their own unique populations who have their own needs/luxuries and production lines. There is inter-regional trade (for example you need rum early on from the New World which satisfies a luxury for an Old World population tier) 

Scenarios have made a come back with Season 3~4, There's cosmetic items you can unlock through scenarios and a golden ticket system, which recently got an overhaul. You can do exhibitions in the main game's monument to get more tickets. 

The multiplayer is also quite robust, and fun with friends (if you can line up the sessions for it) 

I would consider this the best Anno, setting the standard for future titles in the series to come.",1671433884,1682563158,True,3,0,0.563364684581756592,0,True,False,False

She played it for a while and liked it until Ubi Connect started giving her issues and she found herself unable to launch the game at all. Eventually she got so frustrated with it that she gave it her only negative review on this platform and gave up on it. 

It seemed like a cool game to me though, so well aware of the risk of disappointment I picked up the complete edition the next time it was on sale. As of now (April 2023) I have put in nearly 100 hours over the course of more than a month and have not once encountered a failure to launch or other game breaking bug. I want to emphasize that we have nearly identical systems (11th gen I7+RTX 3060 laptop) and have the same internet connection. I can think of three possible reasons for the difference in our experiences:

1: Ubi has fixed their platform between the winter and now. 

2: My wife never uninstalled McAfail anti-anti-malware and this is causing issues. 

3: I have never tried to interfere with Ubi connect's launch or update processes and always allowed them to finish before shutting down my system or launching something else. I can only speak for myself here though. 

I have not been able to convince her to give this game another chance. Which is sad because it's great, especially with the expansions included in the complete edition. When it is on sale for €50 or your local equivalent you are getting a ton of content for what you are paying. 

Yes, the fact that Ubi connect is necessary to launch the game is still a bit crap and yes, it does punish paying customers for buying the game without preventing piracy. But also, I am quite sure the decisions of Ubisoft's management are not the fault of the nice people in Mainz who made this game. I am sure this has been as much a source of frustration for them as anyone. And, to the credit of the poor souls whose job it is to work on the portal, that seems to be working for the moment. So I would say, if it looks interesting to you, give this game a chance.

I have all the DLC for Anno 1800 and have been playing this game for 2 1/2 months (723 hours). It's a very annoying game and I feel it's poorly designed. Lots of repetition and it gets boring pretty fast. You'll never have enough production buildings especially if you're aiming for half a mil population like me (currently at 300k and higher in all 5 of my saved games). It only took me about a week to max out my money and complete everything the entire game had to offer. So I started using Mods to add more stuff to the game and to help with beauty building, the mods have made the game 10x better. I really started to enjoy it, the game without mods just really sucks and vanilla. But every week it seems like the game auto updates and breaks my mods. So I have to keep updating each mod. I miss the days when I just bought the game and played it and no updates. I'm so tired of the updates. I've only been playing for like 2 months and I feel like I have seen like 10 updates (one every week, it feels like). I turned my auto update off in settings and it still updates for some reason. Update Update Update. I'm not even sure what the updates are doing or adding to the game, because I already have all the DLC and my game was working perfectly fine before all the updates. I had no problem with crashes or anything. I haven't played in like a month and I went to go play today and once again there was an update and now my mods were broken. It gave me a mini heart attack, so I'm done playing and probably won't go back to it, because I worked really hard on my city and without my beauty mods, it ruined half my beauty building cities. Luckily all the mods I use are new and most of them have updated their mods since, but I'm tired of constantly redownloading the mods and fixing the game after every update. I thought I'd be able to play this game for years, I put a lot of work in beauty building one of my cities, but I realize if it keeps updating like this I'm wasting my time. I will lose all my hard work with every update and it's just not worth it IMO.

First off , Ubisoft connect . This part is terrible , and I'm always being asked to log on the internet to play the game . There is always something going on with the launcher , and I'm always having to do a workaround just to play the game .

It would be nice if we didn't have to use the Ubisoft Launcher . The game is great . I was happy to put in a lot of hours . But there are times when I can't launch the game because of the launcher , which is having trouble to connect to its own website .

Another problem to list . You cannot overwrite the savegame files . It would be nice if you have the option to do that . 

One other problem that I faced . You cannot send the airships on expedition . The airships can't even fight ground targets . You can however , just bomb them . It would've been nice if my airships can take on ground and air targets .

For ships on the other hand . There are ships like the monitor that can take on airships . Sadly that's about it . The monitor's use is rather limited .

Now for some positive comments . The game is great . I bought this game to play in sandbox mode , and just lay down parks and buildings to admire . Most of the time , I'm zoomed in the cities that I've built , just so I could watch my citizens go about their business .

The music is also great . I'll give the soundtrack five stars , since it was like listening to Enya .

All in all , this game gets a four out of five stars from me . Four stars for the great gameplay and good soundtrack . Minus one star for the crappy Ubisoft launcher , which I often have trouble with when launching the game .",1681926225,1681926225,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It follows a compelling story that takes you through the ups and downs of building your city, managing resources, and dealing with the challenges of the time period.

From the bustling city streets to the sprawling countryside, every aspect of the game is visually appealing.

The visuals and music are really well done, giving a strong 19th century vibe and allowing for good imersion in a game where there is a solid narrative, but it is not the main focus.

The UI is really solid and well organized, giving you the date you need to manage your island's production and trade route. However, there is a clear lack of city-screen overlay so sometimes it gets hard to find the right buildings and construct a well-organized city.

First off, I have been lucky enough to not have to deal with this game not loading or having problems with Ubisoft Connect, and thus cannot comment on that like many other negative reviews have pointed out. Hopefully this issue gets addressed for those it is affecting.

As much as the DLC policy reminds me of a Paradox game, and is absolutely greedy, this is peak Anno city building strategy. So much more depth in production supply chains, distribution and management of goods, residential tiers, building upgrades and so much more; EVERYTHING has been looked at and redone. providing a great experience for new and old Anno players alike. Every mechanic and game-play element has been meticulous refined over the years, and every new DLC adds many more layers to an already deep game. Probably the best game Ubisoft has developed and published in ages, which is sadly not saying much with how formulaic all of their major AAA franchises have gotten. However, due to how expensive the game is I would recommend to pick this up on-sale and would recommend getting the Year 4 Complete Edition. Overall, Anno 1800 is at its peak in the series, delivering an amazingly addictive game-play loop that keeps one hooked, and could easily hold ones attention for 1000's of hours. Thus, Anno 1800 gets a 10/10 from me and is a damn fine game I wish more people played. Highly recommeded.",1670835974,1681750802,True,1,0,0.51086956262588501,0,True,False,False

I've tried so many others: Stellaris, Civ 5 or 6, and some others, but the UI was always cramped with what felt like unnecessary stuff or nothing that was explained. Anno 1800 does an amazing job on letting you know what everything does and it's laid out so well, even my simple brain can make sense of it. 

speaking again on lots to do, I tried the campaign, got like two thousand euros or dollars or whatever the currency is left. was also my first time. decided to watch some YouTube videos on beginner tips and hopped into sandbox mode. it skips the campaign and generates an island for you to do your own thing. you get the AI's once you find them, quests, and loads to build and manage. then there's also Scenarios you can play, and if you want, back to the campaign once you're competent enough. 

it's also funny how the game is like, ""you've been playing for 2 hours, want some coffee?"" or ""4 hours? dude, go touch grass."" it's awesome. 

absolutely recommend this game if you want a resource management, city builder game with a friendly UI and loads to do with a decent learning curve. worth $60? I don't think so, kinda pricey, especially since I purchased it on sale for, like, $20 on the Steam Spring Sale. use isthereanydeal.com to see if it's on sale on other sites.",1681693564,1681693564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My Steam game library reflects mostly military simulations and strategy games, so Anno 1800 is a bit of a departure from those genres for me. Still, it's actually refreshing to not be blowing stuff up for a while. 

So yeah, building bridges instead of blowing 'em down. It's fun. Who knew?

Now you can play in Creative mode as well as Campaign and Sandbox. I've done the Campaign and it's OK, a bit tedious at times, but good learning ground. Creative mode? If you only want to build stuff and admire the views, go for it. There's no challenge at all, and I found myself ""drifting off"" playing in Creative mode. I've found my stride in Sandbox mode. Now, when I say, ""found my stride,"" it wasn't a stride recently. In fact, it was a wretched crawl, a slog through going bankrupt again and again.

Watch YouTube videos - they are your friend. Especially the ones on ""beginners"" and ""economy,"" The game requires balance, and If you take your eye off the ""checkbook balance,"" you are going to experience a sinking feeling, as you plow maddeningly towards game play bankruptcy. On the upside, once you've ""crashed into the wall"" enough times like I have, getting the economy balance is quite gratifying.

If you love resource acquisition, empire building, trading, and in depth supply chain management with a heavy dose of geopolitics and naval and air warfare, then you're a very specific type of player like myself, and this game will light your brain on fire such that time melts away and your personal relationships start to suffer.. but I digress; I've played Civilization and Cities: Skylines for 1000's of hours and I've spent a lot of time on the Port Royal series which I never felt really got there for me. This game is the answer to an ultimate trader game. It's Port Royal on steroids with many of the mechanics of of Civ & Cities as well. I'm approaching 300 hrs of play time on this and have realized I've only just begun to scratch the surface. My only critique would be the glaring absence of all water and waste life support systems.. ie no fresh water source/pumps/pipes/sewer/garbage removal. All other infrastructure is represented and the devs probably ran out of time and could have spent another year installing those systems, so I understand and would love to see a ""Utilities DLC"". Speaking of, foot the extra money for all the DLC's. They're great and expand the game 5 fold. Other DLC's I'd love to see and would buy are expanded map size, and a better diplomacy platform; it's rather vanilla. Otherwise, I'd give it 6 stars if I could!

[list]
[*] Ubisoft, you must download it, you must register in, you must have internet for play even in offline
[*] if you want play with friends you MUST add they into Ubisoft friends, because steam invite doesn`t work in this game  
[*] lobby if worst one that i even see in games, can`t see list of created games, low amount options that can be change
[*] game have achievements, but it`s not connected into steam
[*] trade routes is main way for get money, but information about them is really scarce, you can sell/buy more that 10 resources from one harbor, but message contain info just about that something traded in this harbor, haven`t info how many items sell/buy haven`t info about what income or outcome of this trade, you even can`t see how many times resource was traded in general by trade route 
[*] in balance not showed income/outcome from trade routes, most of times i have income from minus 1000 to plus 400, but my money grow and grow and i have 400k+ money when write this and even not understand what trade give me more money sell every time 100+ work clothes or 9-10 gold ore because i can`t see it anywhere 
[*] DLC, too many too expensive after read description of them start thinking that original game is just demo version compare to all content 
[*] New World is great, but it`s added too many things to manage and keep in mind 
[*] not clear Win condition, after 11 hours+ session i still not understand what should i do for win this game. I just try do all that my people wants  
[/list]

pros:
[list]
[*] good campaign, show most needed things step by step, really fast according to usual game in multiplayer 
[*] good builder/city manager while you not get 7th+ island when you need more and more resources & space for people
[*] good performance optimization, lags only on main menu while ubisoft synk

Starts out deceptively simple - coming from Banished, Patron and Surviving Mars, I thought the systems were overly simplistic and I almost refunded the game. Let me tell you that the apparent 'simplicity' is a ruse. OK, placement of your houses with respect to workplaces doesn't matter and resources do kind of magic their way into the pockets of your people, unlike the games mentioned before. But the complexity comes from the sheer volume of production chains, the needs of your tiered citizens and the dependencies of islands and even regions upon each other. Logistical nightmare and I love it!

What a great decision it was! I only played Campaign for two or so weeks, but I am now totally hooked on it and probably addicted. Just can’t stop playing it. This game is beautifully designed and looks great on my 27” 5K monitor. Of course, I had a hard time at the beginning, had to learn so much. It wasn’t easy, I must admit. I am still learning a lot every day, the game is very complicated, but not impossible to figure out. One thing which I would really love to have is the manual in the shape of the book. With nice pictures and diagrams and all features explained. Personally, I would even pay for it $100. Available help on-line is not really up to par. I am only at Artisan level and have islands in 4 worlds. Almost went bankrupt at the beginning when Beryl declared war on me. But I have survived (so far) and I am doing great financially, but she gets more and more annoyed with me. I did not even started the war, as far as I know.
One thing which bothers me a lot. After playing for some time, I want to stop for a break, so I put game in Pause, but the problem is that my Graphics card, Radeon 6900 XT, still work at full power blasting warm air in the room even though nothing is happening on a frozen screen. Why is that? I know I can completely exit the game but when I come back, I don’t want to wait for the game to load again. It would be so much better to have the computer in idle mode during the Pause in game.
Another thing is with buying islands from your AI opponent. It costs a lot of money to buy all shares, then even more to Takeover the island. But, even worse, after that everything on the island is destroyed to zero. That I don’t understand. 
Otherwise, I really enjoy playing the game for hours despite my other better half complaints. 
Congratulations to Ubisoft for excellent work done on developing this game!!!

Edit. Con l'aiuto degli sviluppatori, ho risolto il problema, ma comunque credo che, i giochi vadano testati decisamente meglio e non solo da Ubisoft, ormai è un mal comune, che mi sta facendo allontanare dall'acquisto di giochi.

Edit 2. Ho appena avuto problemi con la meccanica dell'influenza, non capisco come uno sviluppatore possa pensare UNA CAVOLATA COSì GRANDE, impazzisco all'idea che un gioco così, possa essere influenzato da tale meccanica, se l'avessi saputo prima, non avrei assolutamente comprato il gioco. 

Very nice game itself, too bad it not only crashes, but also freezes the entire PC, making it not only unplayable, but is also causing problems for the PC. By now I buy few games and those few also have problems.... ended up stopping playing. HOW DISGUSTING!! Save your money and your PC, don't buy it.

Edit. With the help of the developers, I solved the problem, but I still believe that the games should be tested much better and not only by Ubisoft, it's now a common ailment, which is making me move away from buying games.

I have perfectly good internet service (I'm posting this review, right?),  and I can play other Steam titles, but I can't play Anno 1800, because Ubisoft Connect has failed to ""synchronize your achievements"". What on Earth? Why would I want that? Even if I did, why on Earth would I want that so bad that I would be prohibited from playing my software until my ""achievements"" were synced? Do you think we care more about ""synced achievements"" than the game itself? Of course not. It's so plainly a money grab, to collect valuable information on players, that the actual money you pay for the game is just a small part of Ubisoft's business model. It's fine if some players want this; let them choose to enroll in a faux social network that's just a walled garden for this one company's video games. Go nuts, have fun! But don't prevent everyone else from using the thing they've bought, just because your servers are having trouble (or even if the player's computer is at fault--why prevent them from using their software, which is downloaded on their SSD, because their ISP is on the fritz or whatever?). I can't play it on a plane? When I don't have wifi? On the road, at a cabin, at a beach, on an airgapped machine? Your positing is that I, the user, NEED this achievement service, which I didn't ask for, to launch a piece of software that takes up dozens of GB of space on my computer? Cool business model! I know I'm in the minority here--it's a fun game, after all, and loads of people love it. But man... this bodes poorly for the future. Always renting software, subscribing, even if you'd prefer to just buy it and never talk to the company again. It sucks!

I like a lots of city builder game, and Anno 1800 tbh is very beautifully done. You can do whatever you want to your city as long as you creative enough. The mods unfortunately need to be manually choose and copy from website but it has lots of choices. The only downside of this game is the ubisoft launcher itself.

Essentially it's called Anno1800 but in essence it's roughly covering progression of most modern nations from around 1720-1890, basic agriculture villages with farming up to modern industrial cities like London, Manchester and Glasgow. 

The clever bit is that you're basically playing a numbers simulation with some of the most incredible graphics I've seen on strategy/city sim in years. I love how you can zoom right in and actually watch the little people going about their busines at work, home, down the pub, transporting things. 

You need to ensure you don't over produce items, you keep supply/demand chains running smoothly, not too much or too little and that over time you make a shed load of cash doing it so you can buy more and more nice things for your towns and cities. Being a Brit myself it's like redoing my school history lessons on the industrial revolution all over again but without a teacher droning on about ""Spinning Gertrudes"" and crop rotations theory!

I've also go my wife into Anno1800 and we've spent the last 4 nights working in co-op on shared team building up civilization, 3-4 hours a night just constantly organising and running the systems, it's really got us talking in game while we play and outside. 

One piece of advice if you're having trouble getting the hang of the game, go to the Anno1800 unofficial wiki and lookup the layouts, they have some superb and extremely efficient layouts for the various industries that means you don't waste space or money and get maximum output from people and places.

If city sims are your thing and you love playing numbers based games with some really cute graphics, get it as it's worth it. Don't bother with the DLCs, you will have more than enough for the first 50+ hours without having any need for more cosmetics or missions.",1680672999,1680672999,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

These backstabbers just can't help themselves.

Even the so-called 'sandbox' mode, where you're supposed to be able to 'freely explore' the world on your own, they can't stop piling on the stress factors, adding needs upon wants, and demands for things too far down the road to even contemplate.

Ubisoft is the center of the universe for anyone with a cruel sense of humor, but are too weak and cowardly to inflict it personally, unless it might be to some poor, cowed spouse.

Always pushing you, to make you fail, the game engine is simply not capable of just letting someone play freely, without an ever increasing amount of harassment and violence.

Ubisoft is lying about any form of 'free play' or 'sandbox' mode.

The game is out to kill you and destroy everything you try and build, in every mode and level that exists.

Beware! If you are not using the latest windows 10, you may NOT be able to load your saved game. I'm using windows 7. My 40+ hours work on my city is gone.

I changed it to positive for two reasons. 1) The developed responded to my review very quickly. Despite the method he/she suggested did not work, it was really nice to have some ""real human"" customer service personal step in. 2) I found some old saves were able to load, despite that approximately 10 or more the most recent saves were not. So I lost ""only"" a few hours of progress (I saved frequently). That wasn't too bad.

The game premise is fantastic as are the graphics, though I prefer ""turn-based"" strategy games I am no stranger to real-time gaming, but I think there should be a way to pause and still schedule your builds.  I find the game mostly frustrating.  I'm sure it is because I do not understand the dynamics well enough, but it should be more intuitive and easier to catch on as to what is required.
All of your saved games are on Ubisoft's cloud storage which has both pros and cons.  Thankfully, I have had no problems with the launcher since downloading the latest from Ubisoft.  Prior to that, the game would not run.

Its very pretty with lovely biomes and graphics. Its an excellent city and resource manager sim and when it does quests it does them relatively well, I thoroughly enjoyed the Enbesa story for example. Sure there's a bit of uneccessary to'ing and fro'ing but fun nevertheless. The game excels in the early stages the most in my opinion. It has some rather stupid design choices - which can be got round using mods thankfully - one of my main bugbears was the idea that the entirety of the african world sat in darkness until we imported cotton, from the new world, to enbesa for wicks for candles - how daft is that??? Flax or reeds or probably 50 other commodities would have formed wicks for candles from the earliest times in every society, bees were everwhere except land under perma frost. Very silly make-work choice (there's a few of them) that still has the capacity to make me grind my teeth in frustration.Some things still baffle me on the entire Anno series, why can't we have apple/pear orchards in our Old world and Trelawny colonies from the get go? Every farm and a lot of village houses in western Europe had a few apple/pear trees, made into cider/perry almost as a cottage industry and brandys' produced locally (Calvados in France for example) and cooked in recipes in all social classes, depending on which country you lived in. Yet these ubiquitous trees don't appear until very late game (in a recipe for apple pie for a restaurant dish in the tourism dlc).Where the game begins to fail in my opinion is the tourism and high life DLC's both of which have ridiculously over complicated production chains. The tourism DLC involving recipes for restaurants necessitating setting up production chains in other biomes and importing the resultant product (or just using the docklands) but which then require micro management in the end building in your chosen capital city, you can't just open all the recipes and tell em to rotate through and just get on with it - no! you have to go into the building and change the recipe manually which is micro management on a ridiculous level - apparently our restaurant/cafe/bar managers and chefs are cretins. The high life DLC is just grind for grinds sake, again the silly recipes things for department stores and furniture stores etc having to be shipped in and built on site and again the stupid micro management. But the worst is that most of your carefully designed and beautiful city has to be wrecked by 75 skyscrapers that look erm flimsy to say the least just to build a specific tower. Of course once said tower was built I promptly removed the majority of the skyscrapers this is supposed to be the 19th century not early 20th and that number made my otherwise beautiful city turn very fuggly - this sort of thing is what leads to cheat mods (understandably) but a bit of better balance and less silly micro management requirements would have sorted the issue. Ubisoft Blue Byte needs to understand that more is not necessarily better.My other problem, and its not really a problem per se as much as a disconnect is in the New World. It simply doesn't gel with the rest of the game. We can have perfume and electric scooters, hydro-electric dams, football stadiums and cinemas but only there, and alongside pirates? Whilst back in the old world our Engineers are still demanding Penny Farthings (a fad which only lasted a few years before normal bicycles took over in the popular imagination). Apparently that DLC is in a different time period?  Football doesn't exist in the old world or Trelawny (nothwithstanding that the game was universal by the late 19th century). If we have hydro electric dams in the New World why on earth don't we have them in Crown Falls? - an ideal site for such a thing. Cinema began in Europe (France in 1895) - Hollywood may argue but that's the facts, so why is it in the New World but not in Trelawny? The type of scooters our Artistas are using are from 1947, Conversely the New World has beautiful beaches and sights but no tourism. I don't understand why one part of this game is apparently some 100 years or so later than the rest and totally not integrated (time line Great Eastern was launched in 1858 when Queen Victoria was 21 years old. Lambretta launched its Model A in 1947).  I find this disconnect jarring and annoying in equal measure. So to end.  In spite of my issues I recommend the game, especially if you get it on sale. But I would also suggest not bothering with the Tourism DLC and especially not the High Life DLC unless you really don't mind ridiculous levels of make work, micro management and grind.",1678395029,1679768718,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the foundation, Anno 1800 IS a resource/economy management and NOT really a city-building game like Cities: Skyline or SimCity, while yes you can build gigantic mega cities, it is not the main aspect of the game so don't expect it to be focused on building your cities.  Instead, the core aspect of Anno 1800 is making a giant economic empire where you build industries with complex production chain to satisfy your citizen so they level up the higher tier and you unlock many new things to build. You start on a big/medium sized island depending on your start setting with only starting resources and fertilities available on your island like iron, grains and potatoes, eventually you reach tier 2 and tier 3 where you need so you need resources or fertilities that your starting island don't have so you have to expand your empire by colonizing an uninhabited island and go to the completely different region off the map on the new world with new resources like cotton and also completely different population tier with their own needs, you can also taking over other NPC island by purchasing all their shares or go on war and taking their island by force. The thing is, the NPCs are doing the same and they want your island too, so prepare to make defensive cannons and train warships so you can fend off enemy invasion.The game will start getting even more complex the more you play because now you have multiple island on different regions to manage and higher citizen tier which need even more complex goods to make, and you just realized how many hours you just lost playing this game.   Mods are not really necessary but it is absolutely recommended because mods add a LOT of amazing stuff like the mod ""Spice It Up"" adds A LOT of QoL improvement and new stuff like ability to construct cities above the water or ""Combat Overhaul"" mod where you and the NPCs can construct new powerful ships and the NPCs are now a lot more competent as an AI where they build more ships and defenses so prepare to get your ass kicked and now the combat aspect of the game is actually fun as an avid RTS gamer.Playing with just the base game is ok but i recommend you to wait for the sale and buy the Year 4 Complete Edition because you get ALL the GAMEPLAY/NON COSMETIC DLC which add A LOT of content to the game like new regions on arctic and africa, skyscrapper, airships, palace, research institute, etc.   The game is also run surprisingly decent on my somewhat old laptop, i got 60 fps with medium-high setting on my i7 7700HQ, GTX 1050 Ti, 12 GB of RAM on early game, but the FPS will absolutely tank to around 30/40, 20 if you look at big cities to render when you reach the end game where you have A LOT of big cities and A LOT of ships/airships, but it was to be expected with my system.  The only downside of the game is that you HAVE TO USE UBISOFT CONNECT, so far thankfully i didn't get serious problem, only once or twice but it is gone after restarting my laptop, note that many people have reported their inability to launch the game so beware of that.   If not for the ubisoft connect problem i would give the game a perfect score but for now this game is:   9/10",1679761591,1679761903,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have plans to do several different playthroughs now that I know a little better how to play the game. I would say that this is a qualified recommendation. If you have played one of the other Anno games and enjoyed them I think that you would probably like this version of an Anno game more than the other Anno games.Anno games are very complex games that have a steep learning curve. So many of the critical mechanics of the game are hidden from you. Also the game likes to spring surprises on you that you will be totally unprepared for and will result in your losing much of your wealth, cities, ships, etc. You can select a save an hour or two before the surprise was sprung so you can totally alter all of your plans to prepare for the 'surprise' that you now know is coming. I just got obliterated by enemy attacks that essentially came with very little warning so I will have to roll back my game and try, try, try again. I was not surprised when this happened in Anno 1800 as I have played two other Anno games and they did the same thing. It seems to be in the dna of the devs to do this to their players. The upside to this is that when you know what is coming and prepare from the start of the game for it there is a real satisfaction to kicking the crap out of the game. So in effect play through the game as best you can to discover all of the 'surprises' the game holds, then start a new game with a master plan to beat the crap out of the game. Alternatively you could watch a YouTuber do a playthrough of the game so you can learn from them how to beat the game. There are also lots of really good tutorials on how to have a successful economy so that you don't go broke as there are hidden mechanics in the game that will wreck your economy and cause you to lose the game from going bankrupt.On more positive stuff about the game, it is beautiful. The voice acting is very top notch (are you reading this Bethesda?) and for me the story line in the campaign I would rate a solid B, OK but not stellar. The music is unintrusive and pleasant, at least to my 71 year old ears. Unless you have money to burn wait for a sale. (I paid 75% off) Watch a walkthrough on YouTube to get an idea of how the game goes. I know some people are adamant about not 'spoiling' the experience by watching a playthough before they play the game.

Anno 1800 is a solid game with lots of depth & mechanics especially if you have all DLCs. however it's very difficult for a beginner. I've been playing city builders & strategy games my whole life, i thought that Anno 1800 will be easy... this game is more like Factorio than Tropico games. you got production chains you have to build & manage. You can't build everything in one island, so, you have to set up trade routes between islands as you expand. You assign one of your ships and tell it to go haul stuff back & forth. If you wanna move to a new island you can't magically have a ""shared inventory"" between all of your islands, you basically start from the bottom once you settle on a new island, well unless you set up trade routes & move materials between islands. 

There are many categories of population that you have to satisfy, whenever you satisfy a population's needs you can upgrade to the next tier of population which will unlock new production chains, things will get increasingly expensive (not just money wise, but resources wise as well) so the bigger you grow the more of everything you'll need, if your lower tier production chains are not robust enough, the higher tier production chains will suffer and so on. The bigger the population the bigger the problems. I can write more but all i can say is that this game requires a lot of micro management which i don't like.

I was dead wrong. 

This is NOT a city builder. For one, there are no curve roads. All late game cities look somewhat similar, just endless grids. And, on top of that, there is no concept of 'traffic'. You can basically stuff so many buildings on one tiny dirt road and it will be just fine. And third, you cannot build a mega city. Your biggest city will be a tiny island which holds very limited amount of people. Sure there are 500+ plus islands that you can build on and the combined population can be over a million or something, but if you want to build just one big city that has everything? Sorry, not possible. 

Being a big civ/strategy fan, I also expected some good combat elements. Again, I was disappointed. The game has no land combat. You build ships and airships, bomb the hell out of your foe's harbor, then the whole island is magically flattened. I find that very unsatisfying. It almost feels like the game HAS TO have some sort of combat system so the devs chose the simplest way out.  

What is this game really about then?
You fulfill the needs of your citizens from different tiers, then you unlock new buildings and you place them. If you don't have certain resources, go settle on another island and build the production chain there and ship it back. Once the needs are fulfilled, you unlock some new things and repeat. 

This is a math game. You have to constantly calculate numbers. I'm not exaggerating when I said 'constantly'. There are so many things you need to do math for. To a point, it's tedious and not fun any more. 

If you want to play a true city builder/simulation game, go play cities skylines or simcity 4. This is not it;
If you want to play a strategy/building game, go play civ5 (it's better than 6 imo), this is not it either. 

But if you enjoy constantly calculating, managing resources/production chain/logistics, you probably will love this game.

A full decade of developing games like these and testing the market to see what works and we still cant get UI scaling in the options. If you're going to have a UI that constantly interrupts the flow of your game, at least give us the option to scale it to a size that isn't like a mobile game developer green lit the design. Having to click the same annoying element that takes up 1/8th of the screen every time a quest is mentioned is a bit much.

The keybindings are questionable but luckily some things can be rebound. Granted you have to pick through a wall of unsorted nondescript bindings mid game because that's the only way to know what it does. Which leaves for more very choppy story telling where voice lines get interrupted and abruptly canceled because of menu navigation.

More on the story without spoiling anything, its either weakly translated or there wasnt a very compelling story to be told to begin with. Which is more of the same from the anno series where they basically take the art of story telling and use it as a door stop. Even if it was translated, its very cliche and not really gripping or exciting.

I'm sure ill run into more problems as i play but ill just make a note now that the asset team and gameplay designers did do a great job.

Nice graphics, but not exceptional nowadays. Good music, voice acted dialogues.

Cons
Limited camera zoom, abrupt camera movements. Repetitive and boring patterns of roads and buildings. No tutorial, very limited tooltips or information about how things work.

Very expensive, basic game costs 59,99 eur and all DLC packs 308,72 eur.

Your park your car in the parking lot, go the snack bar, a smiling teenager sells you popcorn, the place smells good, ticket guy guides you to your seat. Then it's the movie, the critic moment. Is it good? Is it bad? Is it average? It's all about the movie right? You don't really think about the experience up to the movie... it's all about the movie.

Now imagine Ubisoft made a movie and honestly it's a great movie, but they also decided they can upgrade the ride to get there. So you take your car to the movie theatre... but instead of a parking lot you have the park it in a pile of feces, then you have to walk through the feces-lot to the snack tent made of paper where a ""retired"" reddit mod sells you overboiled brocoli while telling you society is the reason he doesn't have a girlfriend. You then go to the ticket guy who is having a panic attack and slaps you across the face screaming ""FIND YOUR OWN GODDAM SEAT"". After you find your seat, which is a rock covered with dried pigeon shit, you can finally enjoy the movie.

The movie is great, but you still go home unhappy.

No kidding, the game actually warns you to go make a sandwich or check in on your family at 2-hour intervals up to 12 hours, of which I have heard more times than I care to admit.

As I noted, it's like a streamlined version of the aforementioned classics: Make and break alliances with AI or other players through schmoozing and intimidation; trade with them or steal from them in a reasonably dynamic market all while battling them with 19th century ships while simultaneously trying to build and evolve multiple cities, colonies and outposts to guard and supply your investments. All this while trying to cater to the needs and whims of your citizens who are more than eager to abandon you should you not provide then with the right flavor of berry trifle or the wrong shade of motorbike.

In addition to this metagame, there are numerous minigames for various rewards, usually  ""specialist"" npcs who assist you in various ways like altering production rates or allowing you to use poop to make dynamite instead of chemicals. Best of all, you can even jump into 1st person mode to solve these minigames (""have you seen the pack of dogs eating my chickens?"" or ""hey can you photograph the two guys pummeling each other behind church?"") and therefore wander the streets of your cities as if you were really a citizen there, before zooming back out to watch your  sailing ships pounding the docks of that nagging bitch who declared war on you just because you didn't ship her tea in a timely manner.

Oh yes, and even when you finally crush your enemies and have in fact seen them driven before you, there's still a half-dozen pre-written scenarios to lament over which create permanent rewards for you in the base game if you actually beat them.

And take pity on the poor console owners of this game who do not have access to the DLC yet or even the very active modding community on Nexus. Revel in your PC superiority...and don't forget to buy a few more [strike]slaves[/strike]  prisoners with jobs from the Wormways Prison!

""I am extremely frustrated with Ubisoft's launcher. It is by far one of the worst gaming clients I have ever had the displeasure of using. Every time I try to launch a game it takes forever to boot up, and more often than not, it crashes or freezes, forcing me to restart the whole process. The user interface is confusing, and it's difficult to navigate through the menus to find what you're looking for. Moreover, sometimes it won't even let me log in, and I am forced to reset my password several times before being able to access my account. Ubisoft clearly has not invested enough time or resources in improving their launcher, and it's only causing their loyal customers to suffer.

The main gameplay revolves around resource management and production, as players must build and maintain various industries to make their city prosper and grow.

As a fictional game, Anno 1800 also reflects the historical context of European expansion and colonialism during this period. The game's mechanisms and systems provide an opportunity to glimpse into the exploitative nature of colonialism and the economic and political relationships of the era.

The game's trade and diplomacy system reflects the geopolitical relationships between European powers and their colonies. Players can establish trade routes, engage in diplomatic activities, form alliances, and even battle other players or AI opponents, reflecting the economic and political strategies of European colonialism in competition for resources and territorial control.

Furthermore, the game's population mechanism also reflects the social classes that existed during this era. Players must meet the needs of different citizen classes, from workers to nobles, by providing food, clothing, and other goods, reflecting the phenomenon of colonialism strengthening and consolidating social classes by exploiting labor and resources from the colonies. For example, I once created a labor island in the game, where I made workers work overtime and built numerous police stations to prevent riots.

Despite its important historical context, Anno 1800 successfully balances gameplay with historical background. The city-building aspect of the game is done remarkably well, offering various building and structural options. The resource management and production mechanisms are also well-designed, allowing players to optimize their city's output and expand their influence.

It's worth noting, however, that while Anno 1800 provides valuable insights into the exploitative nature of colonialism, it is not without potential drawbacks or limitations in its representation of history. For example, the game's portrayal of certain aspects of colonialism may not be entirely accurate or nuanced, and I personally feel that the game's focus on economic and political power struggles may not adequately critique the impact of colonialism on human lives and cultures.

I was going to far, it's just a game, a must-play game for both city-building enthusiasts and history buffs!

The graphics are pretty nice in this game.
The animations and voices are fantasic.
Lots of information on the internet if you have questions... and you will have them.

The expeditions(campaign) are pretty neat, reading the dialog choices you can make, and seeing the results.
The ability to influence your towns peoples attitudes via the newspaper is pretty neat.
The length of time it takes just to do the campaign is long and engaging.

Cons:
Your people are super needy.
Newly settled places don't seem to thrive, and i can't figure out why.
You need to watch hours of youtube videos to figure out how to design a perfect city.
The cost of the expansions are pretty high, but 'a few' add some nice things..
I didn't notice when you send an expedition, if the ship is empty it'll have almost no moral, and each spot you travel takes moral.. so you need to have high moral. (stock the ship with anything, even 50 / 50 / 50 lumber.)

The trade mechanics however aren't in any way realistic. It's rather a goods distribution system. Trade with competitors require special rights which will cost a multitude of whatever you could possibly hope to obtain. 
Money is such an afterthought that sales/buy prices aren't even displayed on the trade screen, but just quantities. The relevant data is all there of course in some sub-menu. But as you can probably guess, prices have nothing to do with supply and demand.
As a matter of fact, coal, soap and potatos are bought in infinite quantities and therefore any trade balance doesn't matter anyways.

The most atrocious crime is the stock system. Do you think it's enough to hold the majority shares of an island to take it over? Not at all. You need to buy 100% of the island and only then can you attempt a 'take over'. Which will cost you roughly the same again that it cost you to buy every single share of that companys island. 
Then it's possible for competitors to buy shares from your islands without you even selling them. Then you have to 'pay' the person who bought the shares even if your island is in the red and doesn't even make money.
It's a bit as if a 5 year old heard about the stock market from a remorseful socialist and tried to implement their own version. It has nothing to do with reality, but probably can be best described as a 'debt forced upon you'.
Oh, did I forget to mention? When you actually do the 'takeover', all buildings on that island disappear and you're just left with an empty island and a port? With all its complexity the game just doesn't take itself seriously and does whatever.

The game itself revolves around goods distribution like you're some communist ruler. You have to micromanage everything, I'm not joking. it's not optional, micromanagement *is* the game.
It's a good case study on to why central goods distribution is a bad system. And there is always a subconcious reminder in your head that tells you: if these islands were allowed to barter with each other on their own, I wouldn't need to set up every quantity, everywhere to a specific amount. In truth, if you can manage to find the time to just supply a single city properly, you're doing it right.

Now is coal, soap and potatos going to be your only source of income? Well almost, but not quite. Trading anything else doesn't really make sense but you get money from citizens. And the good news is: They pay you no matter if they are employed or not. Yes, in fact, you will want to base your economy on plenty of unemployed citizens. Do they open their own shops, do their own things? Not really. There wouldn't be any space on the island anyways to conduct business outside the company. They just live on your island and probably import money from their cousins of whereever. Really it's not entirely clear why this game even has money as a ressource. It could get rid of it, and nothing would be lost to the gameplay. It's all (private) state economy anyways.

In any case, that's my review. Enjoy.",1679053663,1679053663,False,3,0,0.467653602361679077,1,True,False,False

First, this is one of the most beautiful games I've played. It is sheer joy visually and I recommend zooming in to look at the detail as you expand your cities. I particularly like to see the wake as the ships move, Superb!
Second, I play on the ""don't hurt me"" easiest mode because I really need to do that to learn as much as possible without too many distractions. As a beginner there is a lot to take in and you will make mistakes. If you make mistakes, which is making things more difficult playing the game, then erase and start again. At the start you need income, or you will face bankruptcy. Do the quests. Good sellers to get money are potatoes at the start, next soap, next plantain in the New World, along with cannon imported from the Old World. Keep a supply line of cotton going to the Old World so you can sell fur coats. By that time you should have all the money you need.
Third, the economy and balancing supply and demand is the biggest challenge in the game. It can be frustrating. 

If you are the type of player who has little patience, then this is not the game for you.

Fourth, check your supply lines regularly. What seemed essential when you got that ship to move wood may be just going to and fro for no purpose or gain.
Fifth,  leave space as you build and choose your siting carefully. This is a big frustration for me at the moment and I'll give you an example so you are forewarned, because Ubisoft don't!
It is time for me to install electricity. There is plenty of oil in the New World, so I built what I needed only to find I could neither install Electricity in the New World, nor transport the oil to the Old World. Okay, lesson learned.  So I look for oil in the Old World, which is one island and the one I was trying to keep attractive for visitors. Great! I build what I need, after a lot of correcting mistakes, to get a power station up and working. Now I could install the shipbuilding, so I could get tankers built.  No! I found not only does it need electricity, it needs to be in the actual harbor, not where the oil terminal is based.  That means I will have to rip out a sizable amount of infrastructure to get a power station with a rail link to connect the shipyard to build tankers! No warning in-game at all until you see the icon floating above the shipyard. Getting the picture?
Sixth, don't be too ambitious. There is a temptation to grab as many islands as you can. Which is prudent to get raw materials, but developing them to get that missing raw material can be a headache. It might be better to trade. At times there can just be to many balls in the air for a juggler to catch! This is another lesson learned.
Seventh, watch your influence count. I have had to juggle things around a lot to get sufficient means to do what I need to do. This is certainly important when you build a zoo and museum. Another lesson learned. Now I have to find out how to accumulate the influence I need. More on that later!

Think ahead! Watch You Tube videos to get an idea what you are letting yourself in for.
The game is a non stop challenge and I'm glad a reminder comes up to get a cup of coffee. It is an absorbing game which easily passes the time. Good luck!",1677529939,1678975382,True,682,5,0.967066645622253418,7,True,False,False

Briefly, Anno: it's a city builder with production chains. Get sausages by building 2 pig farms and 1 butcher; Builders who have their need for sausages fulfilled can be upgraded to Artisans, which have more tax income and can work in different buildings enabling you to build new production chains to unlock new classes of citizens. Cities are built on islands and different islands have different resources / farm fertilities, so you need to trade between them. So on and so forth.

I'd say it's in the same realm as automation games like Factorio but with much less min-max, short production chains, and very little stress about placement of production buildings. It also has a city builder side and has the typical stuff there, where you have to place service buildings (which you're supplying using your production chains) so their auras overlap with houses and such.

There's also overlap with RTSs. There is combat. You can build ships and attack other players / AI. Unfortunately this side is kind of awful. There's no RPS, no particular thoughtfulness, you either spam units/turrets or you buy special super powered items and units from the NPCs, and then spam units/turrets. Everyone has the same sort of units aside from the pirates. The AI diplomacy is boring in general, and that extends to war.

Compared to other Anno games, this is the most Anno. There's a lot to do. The DLC adds even more. A single game can take quite a while before you've hit the end of the ""tech tree"". And there's different regions to play with (the DLC adding even more), most of which have their own completely separate progression. That's whole extra maps that you get to / have to play simultaneously . Some goods can only be produced in some regions, some production chains require goods from multiple regions, so you'll be balancing a lot of things.

If you're new and you buy the DLC, [b]do not[/b] do any expeditions that unlock ""New Regions"" except for the Campaign one that unlocks the New World (""Finding Isabel Sarmento""). New regions are [i]very overwhelming[/i] when you're just starting, and you'll be unlocking them for the AI as well so they may scoop the islands while you're not paying attention.

Performance is pretty bad. Game looks nice though. Lots of reviews complaining about Ubisoft Connect but it's never given me any trouble.

Overall? Pretty satisfying. AI and war/diplomacy is bad, fighting the city builder is more fun than fighting enemies. Everything else is good and fun and scratches the automation / management game itch without being super min-maxy.

Taking aside that you need the infamous Ubisoft Connect launcher to play the game, I haven't had any issues with the game or the launcher itself. Anno 1800 is quite challenging (base game) and there is a lot to do that can be overwhelming sometimes, but, that doesn't take away the satisfaction of playing it and overcoming the difficult situations one as a player creates for themselves. 

As a player of Cities Skylines is a surprise that this game exceeds several of the aspects that made Cities Skylines stand out. The city and resources management is a top priority always and the more you advance in the game the more you need to manage all your resources in each and all your settlements. 

The only thing I can point out to be a little inconvenient is the fact that there is no active pause button, there is no time to plan your city and arrange your buildings that if it's not done early in the game the available space to build or place a service building will become a problem, Also there is no way to rethink choices and once something is done is done for good, be it an upgrade of a building of any sort or a decision wrongly taken, the game auto save keeps everything most of the time saved until after a decision is made and there is no way to go back from that.

Finish the main game campaign in expert difficulty in least 30 hours , i have fun with this game like the anno 2205.

i tried 3 restart to achieve this
and the 1st i lost because out of money, newly understand the game and 2nd i lost because the island i want not available because enemy settled on it.

what did i do i win in third game?
[spoiler]I found the soap and coal is very valuable item to sell. i focus my pops to produce it and sold to npc island
next once i got my iron and weapon production i build my armada. launch invasion to the 2 enemy npc main island. and focus owning the the shares until the end. my main income is from share income. after that i focus only on main quest [/spoiler]

got profile level 26. too bad the neutral npc base was destroyed in the main quest , read some thread and forum, it can't be repair and forever destroyed they say. i'm going to restart new game again , and continue to do dlc stuff.

2nd comment 11/march/23
I Finish ""The better Anarchist"" achievement. this achieve was a very challenging one.
what did i do
[spoiler] i set the map very small , large island , all visible, large capital , trader fleet. less resource. disable dlc except the anarchist.
first i settle all the island, try to make Dr. Hugo not settle more island. sell lots of potato until 50k. next develop your next island to sell soap. also you can sell small boats too then buy island shares of dr. hugo and win.
Island management. always watch the news propaganda. make sure no sad/riot increase news always change it to other news. don't use it always try to use other news because people will get angry more if repeatedly the same. if they riot , try to make them happy by make them work less in the production just rebuild after they done rioting and return normal production.
as the achievement require don't use police ,luxury good and public service that can make them happy.(pub bar, church , theater and so on.) . you can use lifestyle needs too. [/spoiler]

My first impression is that this game is an all around improvement on the Tropico franchise.  Anno 1800 is simpler where it should be, and has layers of complexity where it is fun to dive deeper.  For example, instead of keeping track of each citizen like Tropico does, Anno just keeps track of the island population and workforce.  This fixes the annoyance of waiting months for someone to walk across the island before being productive at work like Tropico, and makes it easier to have population centers further from production or industry areas.  The game is much deeper in other aspects, like when it comes to building ships, trading, and exploring new areas.  Instead of a ship materializing from the edge of the map that handles all trade like Tropico, Anno puts all of the other factions on the map with you. The player can load up goods, go sailing, and then trade manually, you can wait for them to come to you to buy goods that you have marked for sale, or you can establish trade routes between your own island or NPC’s islands.  Each of these NPCs also manages their own island and fleet just like you, so you aren’t alone in the world.

The atmosphere and soundtrack are also done very well.

These are just a few of the things I really liked.  Overall it is two thumbs up from me.

It's a really good game and fun if you like city builders, the anno series as a whole is pretty good and a lot of their games are dated these days but I like the aesthetic and its a new game with pretty graphics!

Few things I would change is the controls, they are very different from other games even in the city builder type genre and i almost accidentally create a warehouse about 100 times per play.

However, as you progress further and further into the game, you'll quickly realize that expanding your empire starts to become very tedious, and eventually not fun at all. There is no automation in this game. Every single island requires micromanagement, so if you're short on resources of one island, you have to manually either increase production, or ship it from another island. But once you have around 10+ islands to manage, you lose track of what you need to do very quickly. On top of that, if you do end up going to war it just adds to the micromanagement requirement by a lot, cause you need to constantly produce ships and defend all your islands, even though you need to focus on other things instead. 

Look, the game is very fun on peaceful and if you only stick to about 3-4 islands maximum, but that's it. The whole concept of expanding your empire is not possible, unless you want to have extremely tedious and annoying gameplay. There are no views to show you which islands carry a surplus of goods or shortages, you have to go to each island manually. 

For 23 hours into this game, I feel like I already got my money's worth when I bought it on sale for $15. But don't pay full price.

Anno 1800 has really detailed controls and so much data and customization options for that data. I love information, graphs and charts that are very useful, switching between a quasi-first-person view and isometric, micromanagement and the ability to set and forget (just set it right!), a great and slightly unfamiliar sense of humor that can be quite dry and amusing at times, AI personalities that don't feel inert - after 75 hours I can see that this new edition holds a great deal of meaningful challenges.
   Anno is one of the best franchises I have played. I am a huge fan of simulation games like Civilization, Sim City, Medieval Dynasty. The real-time game with no controls in pause can be disorienting and upsetting for a long-time resident of Sid Meiers' worlds; the advantages and delight that result when you give in to that flow are something that the turn-based simulations can't quite emulate.

I saw other reviews mention it, but something so horrific should only exist in horror movies. I don't even care how good the game is (I do plan on playing more), I don't recommend this because of how bad the Ubisoft launcher is. There's absolutely no reason for it. The only reason I even bought this game is because I somehow already had Ubisoft on my PC and an account for some reason that I can't recall. Getting logged in back on the account I had made was such a hassle, the settings in app are horrendous. Seriously Ubisoft, what are you doing.

*UPDATE*

After going through the whole reset my password fiasco and being able to play for 4 hours yesterday, the Ubisoft launcher is trying to connect to an email address I never gave it, and won't let me play the game anymore. 

*UPDATE 2*

Still playing the game, and it's very fun. More problems with the Ubisoft launcher (of course), so I would never recommend any game that requires it.
Options in the launcher include ""minmize launcher to system tray when you hit the close button"", even when unchecked, it still minimizes and doesn't close.
It took 3 or 4 times of me launching it, then having to log out of an account it automatically put me in, that didn't include my game, before it actually started just logging in on my actual account.
Another setting that turns off cloud saving (if i ever lose this computer ill just cut my losses with ubisoft), but still saves to the cloud when unchecked. The settings seem completely meaningless because they still do the thing even when you say not to.

I've played Cities: Skylines, previous Anno titles, Banished, Settlement Survival, Against the Storm, and just about every other you can think of. This one just does it for me. Getting it on sale is a KILLER deal with the amount of content this game has in just it's base form. I was able to get all of the DLC Season Passes here on Steam with the base game for around $70, and I can tell you it is absolutely worth every cent.

I see a lot of people complaining about the Ubisoft launcher, and yeah, while it's annoying, it in no way detracts from the experience for me. It installed, booted up, no issues. It maybe took an additional 2-3 minutes, and that's it. People complaining about this to the degree that they are are just looking for something to fuss about.

The campaign is actually great at teaching you how to play seamlessly, and it will convert to Sandbox mode after you've finished. The ""story"" is good enough to keep you interested and understand why you are building a city, and the quality of life features the game boasts over other games in the genre (such as showing complete production chains in the build menu) is fantastic.

I've sunk in 20 hours, and I'm still only on the Workers tier, with a balance of +2000. If you ever want to get a quick overview of production chains and their output efficiencies, just check out the wiki. The game tells you, but if you're not great with quick headmaths like me, the wiki will just tell you without any confusion.

Add in a first person mode, quests, fantastic music and ambience, beautiful graphics, day/night cycles and dynamic weather, this game is a must-buy for any fans of the city building genre. I haven't even started any of the DLC features, and I am finding myself excited to load up and lose hours each day during my downtime.

It's an amazing city builder and if you're into these types of games I highly recommend it.

I absolutely love that Ubisoft's Blue Byte is back at the helm doing their thing and it shows in all the details. I'm honestly holding on to the hope that Anno will one day visit the SteamPunk era and show it some love. Anno 1800 ALMOST got there but not quite. I've played a ridiculous amount of hours in 2070 and 2205 and love the setups for those games as well. You can never really go wrong in sci-fi. Besides wanting a full on SteamPunk Anno game I'd love to see Ubi do a complete underwater game as well. The DLC for 2070 was on point and wanted to see more of it. Shame they haven't yet.

As you progress through the game, you'll have to manage a variety of different resources, including food, goods, and workers. This can be challenging at times, especially as your city grows and your needs become more complex. You'll have to make tough decisions about how to allocate your resources and which buildings to construct in order to keep your city running smoothly.

In addition to managing your own city, you'll also have the opportunity to trade with other players. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the game, as you'll have to decide which goods to produce and trade in order to maximize your profits.

The gameplay logic is fine. Trade fleets are interesting. Building/city layout is on par with other square based map games. The resource management loop is ok. Aesthetics are where this game does its best; it really shows where the majority of the budget went. The music, sounds, textures and models are amazing. It's amazing they could hire so many good artists and not one good writer. 

Thematically the game is a dumpster fire. This game is far from representative of the 1800s. It's more like a fairy tale of what a sheltered idealist who has never experienced any of the traumas of the cruel world or in justices of society would hope the industrial revolution looked like; when in reality it was much bleaker, darker, and cynical. In short the the story reads like 'something really small happened to me personally so now I am going to start a social revolution that will shape the world.' It has all the fervor of Social Liberalism without any representation of the practices, policies or evils that prompted Social Liberalism form. Monarchism, Religious Perversion, Patriarchism, Aristocracy, Capitalism, Corruption, Monopolys, Corporatism, Imperialism, Colonialism, etc.. seem to all be unified into a single evil character with a long, thin twirly snake-oil salesman mustache. The biggest issues of the time like Slavery, Racism, Misogyny and Universal suffrage are not even touched on. The things that forced people to finally unify and stick up for themselves after centuries of oppression and suppression are glossed over. If these big issues were properly represented as a central villain, then I could better get into the role of a Social Revolutionary fighting for an island of Ideals and liberty. Instead I have a poorly written Uncle whose biggest fault is being an asshole to his family. This plot would better serve a game about group familial therapy. This game massively misses the mark when it comes to appreciating Social Revolution.

Island colony building games are fun; Anno 2070 and the Tropico series have more than proved that, however this doesn't shine above other Island Colony management games. It's better to play the game in sandbox mode then experience the awful story. I got this on a massive discount with it's DLCs, and for that price point, its fine.

Pretty fascinating setup and I want to know more right away.

So, you and your sister take off for an uncharted island where you'll build up small fishing and trading post into a massive city and eventually, empire.

Make note it is probably the best city builder/exploitation game published to date.
The subsequent DLC  releases have enhanced gaming depth and graphic beauty.
This game is totally unique. It centers upon a European style Industrial Age.
Excellent choices of DLCs will enhance your play. They provide further
true additional mechanics, with aspects of the Industrial Age and city depth.
Some are only cosmetic for lights, plants, skins, city ambiance. Most open new worlds,
provide extraordinary additional mechanics greatly improving your use of land
coupled with previous game features.

I recommend those city builders among us jump into researching the game with
DLCs that are available on Steam. Make your purchases now on sale in Steam.
In April, Ubisoft will begin an exclusivity agreement with an organization not favored
in the gaming community.

Pleasant city building as an in-depth learning experience awaits.

After some 2-3 hours of playing I found myself with a start of a city on an island, and the cash going -700. Now is that 700 loss per day? Per hour? Well there is no telling, and oh there isn't even some year displayed anywhere to see in which era you are. Maybe it was 1801, maybe 1900... Who knows who cares, my money ran out. Would have loved to know if it is possible to raise the tax rate, but didn't see anything to do that. Who knows it might be one of those 1000 knobs.

Some reading said that I had not enough jobs. But hey, at some places a symbol hung over telling me ""not enough workers"". So maybe too much farmers and too little workers? Who knows... So you think that upgrading the farm houses would maybe create more workers, but trying to says ""no promotion available"". Well fine nobody needs to promote but why not upgrade?

A game as complicated in terms of micromanagement needs a good tutorial, needs some or some really good video's of someone explaining the game... So you can copy that and ""win"". You just don't get good feedback. And to find out what's what, it would help if one could pause the game to look around... But you cannot pause the game, if you do it gets into some blank mode with no possible actions.

Last but not least, games like this are perfectly fine with graphics as good as Civ3 or so, but I see my 5700 waste 125 watts with the fan on full even if I minimize settings and I'm looking at a rock.

My guess is that there used to be a good predecessor of this game, and that people who played that for hundreds of hours understand how this one works, and enjoy it.

My twelf year old son also plays this game. He has no experience with this kind of games but through the sandbox mode, the campaign and the difficulty settings that are possible even he has learned very quickly how to play the game quite well.

That is an average of more than 12 hours a day! You can make your own jugement from that. The game is addictive as hell! I should mention that I have all the expansions, wich makes the game even more interesting. All expansions are giving so much content. Maybe the ""High life"" expansions with the skyscrapers is an overkill considering all the planing you have to do when upgrading/not upgrading some skyscrapers, but let this be one of the few cons of the game. 

Graphic is good. You can see many base models from previous Anno games, like the artic from Anno 2205. What I realy like are those waterfalls! You can just stand there and enjoy watching them and listening to the sound of nature. 

Music is good. Many base tracks from Anno 1404 (best soundtracks imo since Anno 1602!). You can fall asleep sometimes (belive me I did). Good job here. 

Gameplay very similar to previouse Anno games. The production chain is insane! There are soooo many goods that you need to produce. I love it. In previous Anno games I think they didnt want to have big production chains. Maybe they thought it would be to complicated. But now they made that step and it is insane! I like it. Now with this ""Icebreaker"" I hope to see in future some production chains where I can build in addition to the ""normal"" temperate/Ice/Thundra  island stuff like from Deep See expansion Anno 2070 and Anno 2205 Space/Orbit/Moon goods. That would be a wicked production chain. Would love to see that. 

Usability/UX: Even if you disable ""tips"" (select less guidance), there are too many advices on the screen. Some tips block view of some icons and that was a bit ""anno-ying"" (lol, had to make this joke xD). So, there is room for improvement, dear UX/UI experts. Dont just be ""Pixel-Schieber"" (UI)! Please consider UX too. We are not in the stoneage anymore. 

In total, this is a realy good game and now my expectations for the next Anno are sky high. Dont disapoint me please! I could now write even more, but that would make this review very long and if you are still reading I congratulate you for reaching it here. I had/have a great time playing this game and would recommend the game to you in the hopes that you too enjoy it as much as I did (maybe even more).

Fun and addicting, great for multiplayer co-op. You can have multiple people building things and contributing to the same resource pool. This is really great fun and I have to say there is a LOT to do, without other players helping to manage the empire I would feel totally overwhelmed with the amount of tasks. Even with other players it's still overwhelming, but in a good way. 

The game is not super intuitive so there are a lot of things you will learn by trial and error or by looking it up. At the start you will have no clue what you are doing - and that's fine. It's really low pressure, build at your own pace sort of thing. You will probably want to restart a couple times after you've learned the game a bit more.

Now for the bad, Ubisoft Connect. It's like a dollar store version of Steam where they showcase their many games shamelessly as matter of course every time you launch. Ubisoft Connect is buggy and often doesn't function properly. My group has constant problems with connecting to Ubisoft Connect, often it will show someone as offline even though it tells them they are online. Often the option to invite a friend doesn't show for inexplicable reasons, and the program is very slow to load. Restarting the Connect program is usually the way to get things working again, sometimes multiple restarts are needed. Lately a new bug appeared where I have to launch the program as Administrator in order for it to work.

[b]**Steam invites do not work**[/b] This is obviously by design since every indie game has no problem implementing them. You are forced to interact with the shoddy Ubisoft Connect program, including adding your friends to a special Ubisoft Friends list before you can play with them.

That's most of the bad stuff, other than the game is $80 with $400 worth of DLC. I wish I would have bought some of the season passes while they were on sale. I will be keeping a watch for a future sale because as good as the game is, it still doesn't justify the price tag in my mind.

Oh, and finally, the political alignment of the devs is obvious as they gleefully take pot shots at their political opposites through various dialogues. It's not a lot, but it's annoying when it happens and doesn't belong in a game like this.",1674704373,1674704373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're willing to join me on a not so insignificant journey, I'm going to share why I, a fan of the entire franchise, have come to terms with this latest installment of a franchise I love, but don't want to play.

Firstly, is it more than a bit dirty what Ubisoft did? I don't know why they took the game off of steam years ago only to bring it back, but whatever the reason, I use steam for a reason. It is the most convenient game distribution platform for me and to take Anno 1800 off of that convenient platform just shoots themselves in the foot, since fewer people will see and play it.

That said, why don't I recommend this game?

You can't see me, but I'm literally mad at this product. Not ""grah everthing bad now"" mad. Not even ""it's not what I want"" mad...actually it's almost the opposite. It's too much of a good thing.

Before I expand on that I want you to imagine a shooter. If you're a gamer you've probably touched a shooter at some point, so just imagine a game that has a thousand different guns. Not the modern shooter looter thing where ""this AR-15 wooks wike a Unicown!!1!"" or ""sweet, this +5 blasterine guardian's rifle improves my movement stat by advantage 4""... or whatever. 

Imagine Call of Duty, but with 200 different assault rifles. Imagine Battlefield, but with literally 300 different shotguns...it sounds insane right? At some point you just want to find what works and get to the shooting, right? Well, that's how I feel about this Anno installment...let me explain.

I always loved that Anno was a city builder, but that it used production chains instead of services or population management. I provide fish and lumber and then my people go about their lives allowing me to achieve my goal on the map, whether it is to get 5000 executives or to make a million credits in trade income...whatever!

With Anno 1800, though, I can't even start a new game without feeling dread, as if there are chains around my neck. Why? Suffice to say, there is TOO much to produce. In fact, this is the first Anno I've played that actually has higher population tiers forget about ""lesser"" goods. That's how much stuff there is to produce. This somewhat funnily results in my investors not actually requiring food and instead surviving on a diet of coffee, energized light bulbs and perscription eyewear, apparently.

If you have THAT MUCH in your game to produce...maybe step back and tone it down? I say this because of a ""feedback loop."" Those investors? They make money and influence to support you...but you'll spend some of that on new islands and new production to support those investors. Also the new ships to ship goods to those investors...

Likewise, those investors remove workforce, so you'll need to promote artists to engineers, and then workers to artists and so on to cover the workforce both from before as well as for the new construction...and then THEY all need to be supplied with goods. AND. REPEAT.

If that sounds appealing, well, hey I'm not stopping you. Go for it! I, however, want to be done at some point and get on with my actual real life. Instead I constantly feel enslaved to these fictional people and their constant demands where, in previous games, I used to feel empowered as their provider.

This goes even further with the DLCs as, on paper they sound neat. They sound fun. In practice, though, all I ever really get is just new stuff that I...the master of the Trading Company or Guild or Union or whatever we are, need to provide. 

Bright harvest? Yay, I can turbocharge animal farms! Oh, wait, that one module needs a road connection? It can't just use the main building for incoming grain? Okay...

The Passage? Whee, new region! Neat story...for two hours...after which its just a snow covered colony to provide fur, gold and natural gas. These ""explorers"" have no other purpose but to make more stuff for me to ship? Oh...

I could go on about every DLC and, yes, on paper they are neat. Yet, they always devolve into excuses to make more stuff and ship that stuff so I can make more stuff and get more investors to colonize more islands so I can make more stuff and...my head actually hurts, right now.

What would I like? Well, maybe I'd care about research and exploration if we'd get some neat quality of life improvements! Yeah, how awesome would it be if I could make power lines! That way I can have a power plant in a remote area near the oil instead of smack dab in the middle of my city with it's clunky rail line choking up my island!

Or maybe we could, FINALLY, have A.I. players that don't cheat? This was a 2019 release? C'mon Ubisoft, I know you can do it...

Before anyone points out the ""scenarios"" I tried two of them and they were kind of garbage. Eden Burning stood out as it has a neat concept but cutely avoids telling me things until it is more than just inconvenient. Oh, that fish farm that will literally solve all of your problems and needs one resource, well we're going to tell you how to get that resource only when it's too late for you to do anything. Tee hee, guess you have to start all over...isn't that challenging, hurr hurr hurr!!!

I could keep going, but I think my point is made. I wanted to like this game, but I don't really feel challenged. Challenge isn't rewarded with more challenge, that should be something I choose to take on when I'm ready. I never feel like I'm working towards a goal except to make yet more stuff to ship around. 

Put simply, my difference in opinion among the Anno installments is that while managing 15 or so islands is okay, micromanaging 150+ is asinine and, frankly, insulting.

I have run through the campaign, which turns into free play after a few quest goals, but after a crash my save of about 40 hours is saying I need Botanica DLC to load it. I never had any DLC, so why should it now need one? Lol, or UbiScam?

Further edit -  30+ hours into the next game, occasional crashes again, and the autosave now is for a different empty world! Thankfully I had a fairly recent manual save.

Further edit - second open world is now crashing, loads a blank world. [FFS]

Pros on this edition:
- Pretty
- Expeditions
- Can play without the DLC - edit - actually ot looks like you can't always...
- can move around whole chunks of buildings
- blueprint mode
- to improve your residences, you only need to meet the Needs, there are also Happiness benefits, and other Lifestyle resources you can provide for further ""free"" benefits. 

Cons:
- repeated crashes, saves no longer working. Makes it unplayable. 
- Plenty of expensive DLC
- specific resource supply/demand data is not available. You can work it out roughly with some effort, but every time your population goes up more than a bit you have to refactor loads of things.
- therefore it can be very very micro-management
- while you can move and rotate sections of town, fields are a bit of a nuisance to replan if you need to e.g. lay a route across part of it.
- annoyingly large number of epic sperm whales found for the zoo, but other set animals very elusive!",1673544895,1674297570,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do not recommend because how Ubisoft publish its season pass. No discount on Steam, even harder to locate in store. Their own storefront has it constantly on sale.

Game itself is a time killer. However it is very discouraging to pick up again after a while or do micromanagement after long playtime. 

I hope one day Ubisoft could come back to this platform, like Sony, Xbox and EA.

I do have very limited free time so spending $60 for this is the max I would consider paying for another city builder but I'm satisfied.  I probably should have just bought the gold edition for nearly the same enjoyment given my situation but they got me paying a bit extra to have all of it but for some cosmetic dlc.

update: i'm now 50+ hours into playing and unfortunately have lost interest faster than expected.  I'm still playing here and there but its not a big priority.  if you really enjoy city builders or you've got a big budget for games then i'd say its still worth paying $60 for everything, but for me it cost too much for the entertainment I get.

TL:DR at the bottom.

Now, yes I do own all the expansions on Uplay, and a friend gifted me the Steam version and ALL of my expansions have carried over, though not my save files. I'm also not in the slightest bothered by Uplay, I've never had an issue with it, but that could be luck of the draw?

Anno 1800, for me at least, is just extremely peaceful. Build a city (or many) in the vague 1800's era, starting from farmers living in wooden huts eating fish eventually to the high society living in skyscrappers, taking walks through zoos with animals acquired by you on the different missions. You'll manage supply chains to different islands and different regions! All the while having to deal with your opponents fighting for the same resource rich islands.

Though personally I play with all the AI on the easiest setting (they ask if they can settle islands, their generally just slow in progression, and sometimes give you random money) for a peaceful time. All the settings are pretty customizable as well.

My few issues with the game would be the different areas. I believe in Anno 1404, the diffrent regions were just part of the same map, but in different locations, in 1800 however, they are different maps all together. So with the expansions you're going to be jumping between the Arctic, The old Wold, Africa, Crown Falls and the new world. Because each area has it's own missions and resources it has. While it's a lot of variety, I can see it being VERY frantic on higher settings.

I also don't think combat/war is all that great. It's there, it's serviceable but previous Anno Games have done it better. But as a peaceful player... that's okay.

And lastly, and weirdly I'm sure, some of the music is just annoying? Specifically the trouble/alert music. So much so that there's an option to turn off that music specifically in the settings.

TL;DR: I adore Anno 1800. It has issues with multiple regions, some annoying music at times, and combat woes, but all in all, it's my absolute favorite game in the genre and I highly recommend it. I've not had any issues with Uplay but others have so... idk.",1673194188,1673194188,True,1,0,0.529411792755126953,0,True,False,False

Anno 1800 is still absolutely fantastic. Since they've finally said they're done releasing DLC for the game, I hope the next Anno game they release is a true successor to this one. With the DLC, this feels like a real masterpiece. They did add some annoying mechanics, like in the Arctic, but the Arctic is a smaller region that really just exists so you can get gas (which isn't a bad thing). However, they have made the game quite a bit more fun and helped remove some of the RNG of rolling for specialists (Enbesan Scholars). 

You definitely are CPU bottlenecked in the late game with a 9700k. Upgrading to a 13700k greatly helped with overall performance. So if you've got an older rig, you might need to turn down population density settings.

Original Review:
Disregarding the game being an Epic store (and Uplay) exclusive, this is the best Anno game that has been released in the last decade. Changing between regions is seamless, the regions don't have annoying mechanics like 2205 (heat, building under the asteroid shields, etc), and it doesn't feel like you can run through the entire game too quickly (like 2205). 

With a 9700k, 32GB of RAM, and a 3080  the game runs flawlessly at 1440p, at least until you get bigger cities and speed up the game. This seems to be more of a CPU limitation though, GPU usage is always fairly low even with very high settings.

Overall, it's pretty good and I'd recommend it if you enjoy Anno games.",1555520214,1673193723,True,2,0,0.507452249526977539,0,True,False,False

If we are going to have such a stupid tax system, that will penalize you for your population, then I want a sales tax, a property tax, trade tax, my hospitals need to have a fee for services, tickets given out by the police, there needs to be more income based options with advantages and disadvantages for each one.

Edit: I believe there must have been a bug in relation to my income on the first game I played. In my first game, whenever I built a building, my income would swing into the negative, then back to positive after 10 - 15 seconds, instead of just taking out the funds through my available cash. 

In my second game the income is no longer drastically affected by me creating new buildings, the income does change in relation to what I have built, but no longer has the wild swings that the first one had, making the game much more playable and less stressful.

Royal Taxes are still a pain and dreadfully slow down the game, there is not a point to the taxes other than them just being there, sucking your gold. If the developers wanted to make a way to keep you from just building a single class and raking all the money from them, they could have tied unemployment and it causing low moral or happiness.

But then you will

And it feels like you've conquered the world

Only for the NEXT production chain to unlock...

Even worse - the production chain you set up two or three levels ago has now outstripped it's supply vs. demand and, oh fuck, you're now 2000+ in the hole because your engineers don't have enough toilet paper and are having to use the mail they're supposed to be generating to wipe both ways xD

The combat - what little there is, there's no land combat - is a joke and an annoyance and, even at higher difficulties, it's trivially easy to soothe your way into the NPC characters good graces

Even the pirates

Like, once you know what you're doing, I highly advise upping the difficulty - because the bonuses and benefits you get at normal make the game way too boring slash easy - while the smaller budget and constant tug of war between poverty and enough profit will spur you onwards to build more chains even when you don't want to

And at least seventy percent of the DLC is superfluous - with the remaining ten percent being good fun and the final twenty percent feeling like the game is unplayable WITHOUT IT

Looking at YOU haciendas...

But there's nothing else like it - there's nothing that feels quite the same or decorates quite the same despite being so heavily tied to a grid system with no angles or curves (almost like the limitations of the game spurs you onwards to be more creative) or has so many interacting systems that don't just interact - but interlock to the point that you'll be wanting to download mods to make them interlock even more

I bought the ""complete collection"" on sale for $60, which includes everything except the cosmetic stuff. The value so far has been incredible.

A lot has been said about this game already. I will just sum things up by saying the Anno 1800 overall is relatively accessible and lets you play how you want. Just be warned, the mid-game can get stressful once you unlock the different regions. While jumping between regions is instant on my PC, trying to manage it all gets a little hectic and little supply problem can quickly snowball into going bankrupt. Once you get the basics set up and stable, things start to feel more enjoyable and you can enjoy the game again

In my 70 hours (and counting) of play, I have restarted about 10 times. Each restart I get further into the game and build more efficient supply chains. 

While you might want to ""figuring it out on your own,"" I do recommend checking out videos and guides online and am learning that there are many very important mechanics that you might be overlooking.

The only issue I have with the Ubisoft launcher is that is logs out after 2 hours and will not ""remember my PC"" and keeps requiring my to receive a code on my phone. It also doesn't want to sync my saves to the cloud.

It's great to see the game back on Steam, and though Ubisoft's launcher is still needed, The game is still worth the added hassle.

I would highly recommend all the season passes, as the content added into the game is often game changing in many ways. From new worlds to find, new buildings and production lines, and a bunch of QOL additions to older content. 
Silo's for farms, Which heavily increase production while lower the amount of space need. Tractors to once again double your farms output. 
Anyone who has played any Anno game knows space is limited.

My only con for the game, is there isn't factions anymore. One thing I loved about Anno 2070 is the different factions, adding a bit of uniqueness.

The campaign, which definitely could have been finished much sooner but I took my time, is an okay enough story that hits all cliche moments you would expect in family drama that has a mysterious death. The game itself is great for those looking for city management and building. One of my favorite features is the fact that everything was easily movable so when I was learning the game I could always move things around when I understood how things worked. I was always stopping to reorganize my islands and make sure they looked their best while also functioning properly. There will be a learning curve for those new to these types of strategy/city building games(small tips in game and no real tutorial) but if you played games like AoE, Ceasar, Zeus or Stronghold then its not too difficult to understand what needs to be done.

IMO, diplomacy is lacking in the game. If I were to compare to a game like Civ then this game falls short. It was easy for me to manipulate and get my way 100% of the time which made the campaign run smoothly in terms of wars and trades. I am interested in seeing how they do on a more difficult mode but on normal they were far too easy. All my focus was on the bad guy in the story and I ignored pretty much everyone else and gave them an occasional compliment to keep them off my back and from taking up too many islands. Trading was not explained well in game so I had to figure out myself how to set up routes but it was not all too difficult to understand.

The game ran smoothly for me with no issues. I think there might be a bug with expeditions not identifying Items properly and inserting them in the Goods slots which was an issue when I needed space in my ships but it wasn't game breaking and I still was able to finish these runs.
Speaking on Expeditions, for me they were quite fun to read. I liked making sure I was prepared for a trip and making choices in the story to see what happens or what I could find. It felt a little like a DnD experience.

[b]Overall[/b], I recommend the game! I cant wait to continue playing and seeing what more I can do. Every-time I thought I was nearing the end of my city building a whole new tab would unlock or another world would become available to dominate.

Does the 'tutorial' explain how to make money? [i]Also no.[/i]
Does the 'tutorial' explain how to determine the effective range of your buildings? [i]hahaha. no.[/i]
Does any of that strike anyone else as important information for a city builder game? [i](Hint: yes)[/i]

Once you get past the point of needing a tutorial, you might find that you have multiple islands, and some of those islands may specialise in producing certain things. And other islands might need those things. So...
Can you automate the exchange of goods between your own islands? [i]YES![/i]
Can you automate those exchanges so that they maintain resources at each island at a certain level? [i]Also yes![/i] But only by setting expected stock levels at each of those islands, hoping that AI ships show up and purchase or sell those items, and then losing that money because you're selling and then re-buying the same goods.
...Can you automate those exchanges using your own ships? [i]You can![/i] You can create instructions for your ships to collect a certain amount of an item (0-50 in one slot) from an island and then drop off that slot's items to another island. But you have no control over the minimum stock to be left, what to do with excess stock (except throw it overboard, if you'd like), how many slots will be used if you have excess of an item (the ship will just keep collecting the item, even if it's already got a full stack), or even how long the route should take (meaning you cannot meaningfully calculate production rates for resources - despite all of your buildings having explicit timeframes for production).
Which is to say: ...Can you automate those exchanges using your own ships? [i]Nyet. Negatory. Nuh-uh. No sirree fucking bob.[/i] But you can manually send a ship each time you want a resource on one island to get to another island, and that process is more painful than urethral surgery as performed by someone who has only ever watched a game of Operation!(TM). 
Which brings us to the UI. The default keybindings are crap - you will probably want to setup WASD so that you can move the camera around because its the year 2023 now (HAPPY FKN NY!) and apparently no one playtested the game and noticed that scrolling with mouse + the up-down arrows is just utterly awful - a lesson I thought we had learned in 2001. 
And the building interface! This is my favourite part of the game, because it reminded me that, if I ever wanted to get into game development, I can definitely do better than actual paid developers. Utility buttons - like relocate and demolish - are tiny - which isn't a big deal but, like, why? 
The default layout for buildings themselves is by 'progress' - so by worker type essentially. Thankfully the base roads and the key building the warehouse are present in every 'progress' tab, so that you have easy access to them... wait, what's that? It's only in the farmer tab? But what if I'm laying out my weapons factory district? I need to switch between them? There is one of those tiny buttons to select for road placement instead but you might not notice it until your 12th hour in because again, tiny, even to reasonable eyesight. It also doesn't solve the warehouse problem.
Heads-up, if you reach the artisan stage, one of your advisors will tell you about collecting sand to turn into glass. You might close this tip window but your advisor CANNOT. WILL NOT. BE STOPPED. COLLECT SAND. which feels like a really stupid bug except that it has survived to the 4-year complete edition.
There's other stuff with the UI - the construction grid is pretty hard-to-read, there's no easy way to tell the size of a building without hovering a blueprint over the grid, and there are some special ornament buildings that require a special resource - namely, it needs the special ornament building - and the game communicates this to you with a smaller version of the image of the building you are trying to build and I would suggest that this is perhaps unhelpful as far as tooltips go. 
Also, it's weird that I cannot pause the game and plan out anything - even the slowest passage of time is still fast enough as to interrupt city building. 
You can't direct your ships to attack other ships unless they are in close range of each other. If you receive a quest to destroy a ship, you will need to send your ships on an intercept course, and then ask them to pursue if they ever get in range of the target. 
Speaking of quests, the characters you interact with are not interesting. They basically have a funny accent and then yell a single word at you over and over again (QUEEN! DUTY! ISLANDS! etc.) - characterisation nailed!
________________________________________________________________
[b]TL;DR[/b]
Even with the 4-year complete edition, the game feels incomplete and in an early-access-feature-bloat-march. There is no tutorial (the campaign is actively useless in explaining the key mechanics). The key concepts are not intuitive to a new beginner and are not explained in any way. The UI is a chore to use. Effective automation is practically unattainable - locked behind either relying on your AI opponents, who will show up at random, or by constantly, manually, revisiting each ship and trade route to make sure that your schooner hasn't loaded up 100 tonnes of schnapps despite the route only ever requiring 50.

If you're looking for a similar game, I would recommend drilling the part of your brain out that remembers how Tetris works and then playing Tetris. I think there's a lot of words already said about how the game is essentially Tetris (fill in all the squares) but I think Tetris (and innumerable other games) are better at explaining their key concepts and the how-to-play information than Anno 1800.

 - Very pretty. Lots of cool little details everywhere
 - UI is pretty smooth, all things considered. Theres a nice smooth learning curve ->
 - Both in UI but also Mechanics. 
 - tons upon tons of things to do.

Do yourself a favor and buy the Complete Edition that comes with all the season passes.  It's not well described on Steam.  If I could, I would refund everything I bought and buy the Complete Edition and then the Cosmetic Pack Bundle.  If you google Anno 1800 and look at it on the Ubisoft Store, there is a nice chart that tells you what you are getting with each edition.  Something SEVERELY lacking on the steam store.  Good job Ubisoft though, now if I decide I want the other DLCs I have to spent even more money to get the same thing.  

The game itself is enjoyable and very pretty.  It's a city builder without all the complicated crap most other city builders seem to have.  The equation for income/expenses is pretty straight forward.  Though, I would say it took a little bit to figure out.

Anno is a great city builder where you also micromanage manufacturing chains in different time periods and has a campaing guiding you through, alongside with a sandbox mode, but it is plagued by one of the worst publishers you could ask for.
So come grab this former exclusive that was removed from steam during preorders, its four season passes and tons of DLC priced as if it was brand new and not a 3 year old game that they decided to double dip just now; it includes the requirement to use Uplay regardless on where you're buying it and has the only DRM known to harm performance despite being useless.

Lots of attention to detail, gorgeous graphics, compelling play, fairly low difficulty curve that builds to a very busy managing multiple settlements at once playstyle.

High quality game, great for some laid back city building with trade, piracy, and knifing your competitors.

A steal at sale price.

A lot of the DLC is also very worthwhile if you like the game style. Adds new regions, new goods chains, new requirements, massively increases the breadth of things to fiddle with.

A lot of the negative reviews here are not for the game itself, but its troubled history of bouncing between game services - Steam and Ubisoft, and not having DLC on sale for those that originally bought the game.

I own nearly every DLC (not sure if any are missing, since ubiconnect does not do a good job of listing DLC / activations)  I aquired most of them through steam (year / seasion passed) and the rest when they were on sale on the Ubisoft platform before they returned to steam.

I've played both vanilla and modded versions of this game and the only negative I can think of is the lack of custom islands on the modded version, something to do with how those assets are embedded, and the vanilla lack of industrialization of base goods at later stages of the game, becomes spamming of the base buildings in a none aesthetic way... but modding solves this issue.

Railroads were lauded by reviewers are hyped before release, this is a under utilize feature that could have been a way to for more advanced logistics but its really just the only way to transport a specific good (oil) from the source to the production buildings or port in vanilla.

The campaign is a solid start that takes you though a story of two siblings and there quest to clear there family name, which then merges into the open sandbox game.  A unique building and starting island (never saw it repeated on my playthough's in sandbox) is available if you play the story.  Many islands are repeated by there are many variations which helps negate this if you end up with two of the same in a map. 

You can go with optimal layouts but this game is so pretty I prefer the less efficent, 10x10 for more realistic looking cities even mixing in production buildings that would be better off near the raw sources. 

Love the AI's, each with there own backstory that takes a while to discover and how they play with each other, too bad you can only have 3 of them [not modded].  For those that played 2205 only, this game returns to the classical approach of Anno with several opponents all taking islands you may need leaving you with a few options to evict them if you are, rich, or strong enough.  Play with one star AI's if you are having trouble, they will ask you first before settling, the other AI's use timers and priorities to settle new islands and after enough play-throughs you'll see the patterns.

I am disapointed that there won't eventually be a sequal since 1+8+0+0 = 9 and all Anno titles years add to 9...  Hoping there will be a year 5 set of DLC's

The cross-island and multi-map (Old and New World, etc.) gameplay is the only thing I would warn people about that believe they know what to expect from games like these.  I have found it a bit more difficult to manage resources across maps than when I play other city building games.

The way the population class is setup, in my opinion can negatively effect how you can build your city.  You are required to make either quest, trades or deals with the other in game npc's otherwise you get negative ratings from them and they eventually declare war on you.  Financial management is a problem,  by the time you establish enough goods to comfortably trade, the other players have already acquired the same goods.  As you try to upgrade your population from farmer, to workforce to artisan, you have to maintain the same amount of farmers in order to work your fields and you need workers to maintain your factories.

cant zoom out far

zoos and museums are pointless uses far far too much influence 
ships seem far too limited slot wise making expos silly your for ever throwing stuff over board
cant take over islands without influence ive just opened up region number 5 and having no influence means im stuck dead trying to destroy stuff to get more influence !!! ffs
the lack of an active pause is also a big big miss any kind of war with even an ai on so many maps all at once its utterly stupid im struggling with 3 maps ive since picked up 2 more sadly given its now 4 years old i cant see it getting added
story line is really really short its only a couple of hours tops might aswell have not bothered

But into the review

First I must admit that it was a game that right away sucked me in for first several hours, it was a game that amazed me with the amount of things you can do. 

In my opinion, if you are a city builders and/or Anno series fan, I would really recommend you to buy this game because:

-  it has a ton of fun mechanics
- soundtrack is lovely 
- gameplay is pretty satisfying 
- graphics are beautiful. 
- I found no major bugs and I experienced no crashes
- well balanced difficulty levels

but to not leave only praises I found some issues:
- Gameplay is repetitive and got me bored after one game 
- tutorial tips really do not explain the game mechanics, they just tell you what you need to do to advance into new era
- Pirates are annoying af
- Diplomacy is broken

Overall, to me this game is an unpolished gem of the genre, but as I said earlier it has some issues.

Also, why does the game tease you with the possibility of building bridges when it absolutely cannot be done?  I tried everything.  You simply can't drag a road over a small river in hopes that the game will realize that you want to build a bridge over that river.  Shouldn't a dirt road be able to accomplish this?  A paved road isn't any better.  Is there a patch available to fix this silliness?  It doesn't matter how much timber you have, bridges cannot be built.  4 hours in and the numerous game design flaws are readily apparent.

Five minutes later after writing this review, a wooden bridge magically appeared out of thin air exactly where it needed to be.  SMH.  

Here's a bit of a review I left on Youtube just a moment ago after 10 hours or so of play:

Laying down a bridge for the first time in this game is probably the most frustrating ordeal I have ever had to deal with in my life.  It was clear I did everything correctly: my sawmill was functioning properly, I had more than enough cash, and plenty of workers to chop trees and transport them to the sawmill where they were turned into planks.  My warehouse was taking forever to make wooden planks and there was no indication that all I needed to do was be patient.  Why the hell didn't the game give me some indication of how long it would take?  I think it takes about 40 wooden boards to build a bridge but the game buried that info in a small tool-tip panel that was easy to overlook.  Ridiculous. 

Then later in the campaign, I was tasked with building a sailing shipyard but the game never identified the correct button that opened a panel that contained the build option for sailing shipyards.  It was hidden behind a harbor button.  Harbors and shipyards are two very distinct structures in real life.  Most all other tasks that I needed to accomplish previously in the campaign highlighted exactly where to click so as to eliminate any possible frustration the player might have trying to locate the item.  Seriously, what gives Blue Byte?!?  Don't you guys have any common sense when it comes to game design?  Apparently not.  

And don't get me started on the cringe dialogue with the overacted voice acting.  OMG!  The dialogue is so overdone and overacted.  Who writes such garbage?  Clearly the writers of this game were trying too hard to impress with their attempt to capture the way in which people used to speak in the early 1800's.  And that dude Aardvark or whatever his name is; never have I encountered such a pretentious and arrogant douchebag in a game before.  And there is no option to have this fool executed on the spot for being so insufferable.  JESUS FUCKING TITS that dude is more obnoxious than a millennial -- and that's saying something if you know anything about toxic millennials, and they are all toxic.

This is a classic example of why graphics don't make a video game - the graphics in this game are spectacular, but the story and the game play is seriously lacking.

Why am I still playing this game?  Because it looks great and it gives me a fair approximation of what life was like in the 1800's.  I'm a concept artist for film and TV and this game gives me a lot of great ideas for camera shot placement and landscape illustrations for the time.  I can also change the time of day for nighttime lighting ideas.  I like that the game gives me enough camera control so I can look out towards the horizon for cityscape designs and such.  FYI, this game is a godsend for scene artists that need ideas for establishing shots in film.  

Bottom line:  the game is gorgeous, German game designers can't design games and should resign quietly from the industry in familiar German shame.  Just look at their language; probably one of the most convoluted and unnecessarily complicated and bloated languages in all of human history.  Whatever happened to excellent German engineering -- is that some kind of myth because I thought German's were superior designers?  

My score to this point is 6.5 on a 10 point scale mostly because the game looks so good and has such a great soundtrack.  AI in this game is retarded.  The campaign mode does a terrible job of explaining the mechanics of play.  Ubisoft's involvement brings the game down several notches with their DRM bs.  Ship combat sucks.  There's no land combat as far as I can tell and the game does a terrible job of introducing new players to the series.",1670899114,1671423329,False,7,2,0.437474310398101807,0,True,False,False

I might not have huge amount of hours played in this version, but had a chance to play a bit in the past in beta and later on during ""free"" weekend/days/hours. I am not an expert, but I do have to say few things I find problematic in this Anno game.

Let's go a bit back to older Anno games. Original Anno came out in 90s, was one of the first games I bought/got from someone and I was around 10 years old. Played that games for a really long time, until I had no idea why I was losing money all the time. First Anno was good game, but really hard. Sequels followed original Anno mechanics, but devs took their lessons and fixed few issues and balanced gameplay. 2nd and 3rd games were also fun and hard. Each game had some good and bad points, so as a fan, you were mostly happy about the changes. Then Anno 1404 came out and revolutionised whole franchise and till this day it is still considered masterpiece by many. 2070 used mostly mechanics from Anno 1404 and expanded with future story and design, allowing you to play as three different factions, different type of style/buildings. It was a good choice and even with few issues, it was almost a perfect game.

Now, Anno 2205 and the fall. Till this day I do still have zero idea what devs were thinking allowing so many strange changes to Anno game. They had people who said ""hey, this game is perfect. Just follow similar ideas/mechanics and expand."", but sadly, devs went into worst possible way. Yet, they did release 2205 and I have zero idea what that game even is.

However, 1800 received huge amount of mechanics and ideas directly from Anno 2205 and those mechanics still suck. I didn't had issues with graphic designs, nor music, since original Anno. Gameplay is almost the same, you have ship or already port and you build, mostly. Then you fight, colonise more and push till you are done. But my main issue with Anno 1800 is simply with core mechanics and changes brought from 2205. Bigger fields, terrible design UI, notifications, whole camera system and much more. It's almost as if instead of staying with simple designs, you made it complex, but to the point of confusion. After those many hours, I do still have problems navigating building menus, hardly understand why I need to upgrade x amount of building, so my production won't be halted, but then I have too many workers, not enough farmers, need to build more houses, but where? It's a chaotic game, where even a person with years of experience playing rts/city builders has issues with understanding what's going on. 

Anno 1800 is very confusing game, it's very complex and sadly, not a good game.

I am sure if Anno 1800 was my first Anno, I would love it, but since I am a person who played every Anno game, this is a huge fail. Not to mention issues with going exclusive to Epic/Ubi stores, waiting couple years to come back to steam, just to see its fall. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I dislike anything new, it's more that game isn't that good. Other part that's pretty much negative in my own eyes are DLC's and following live service type of a game. Yes, it will give you some money. Yes, more likely, additional people will buy them, but at the same time, you should focus on making a good game, not a game that will sell. Many devs have forgotten that if you make a good game, one without horrible mechanics and systems like for example Diablo Immortal, then people will buy it even on day. Look at Elden Ring, a solid game with small issues at the beginning and sold more then 10+mln copies.

Make a good game, Anno 1800 is ok-ish game and I do wish devs only positives in the future. And if you are reading this, let's meet up when next Anno game is going to be released. Hope it will be as good as 1404 or 2070.",1671402348,1671402348,False,3,0,0.526259362697601318,1,True,False,False

The Game despite of huge size more than 40 GB size, even bigger than Cities, The game really can run well at Low and Old Spec CPU, mine is i5 2500k with 12GB RAM and 1GB GT 720 GPU with Low Settings, No even Lag and much faster loading than v9.2, i guess the game has cache inside the 80 GB file size so the performance is really flawless than i played like Cities or ETS2 with minor to medium lag

So the Positive is
The Game runs well with old and low specs, minimum 3Ghz quad core for no lagging
DLCs are already inside the game files, just need license to open it
The graphics have no problem with Nvidia
12GB RAM with Dual Channel config is enough, no need page caching
Features Building and Item kinds is complete and challenging, no other building games like this (yeah maybe you need trainer (?) even you use trainer, it is only just one step easier, but others still challenging)
The requirements and optional needs to upgrade is simple
Modding available and not really impact the performance
Music Background really catchy and enchanting than other games

But the Negative is
Still has some bug even new bug than old version
You still need Ubi account to use it, Yes despite you bought from here, the games also must be paired to Ubi Connect, but the pairing is instant process
Download size is Huge around 42 GB, can take 15 hours for unstable download speed with max speed 17 Mbps, just wait really patiently
The game is not for low speed processor below 2Ghz, but if you had GPU with 2GB VRAM, it can run with some minor lag

The conclusion is:
This is the game that you will really like, you can set up the options like you want, if you just want peacefully building without any factions you can choose it, the performance is the best after all optimized well for low and old specs, 3Ghz CPU and 1GB mid high GPU plus 10+ GB RAM will do it, modding? yes you may need it but not so impact to performance since you may not need custom building right? the entire inside game is already complete",1671382059,1671382059,True,2,0,0.487804889678955078,0,True,False,False

If you are into colony sims/management, this is an excellent pickup. I usually only buy games when they're on deep sale (meaning <$20) so I was hesitant to buy the base and all dlcs right out the gate. Went for it and got the complete edition on sale (67%) for $60, and I think it's worth it. 

Pros:
-Rewarding gameplay loop. Involves managing many, many resources across different islands and regions. Lots of ratio management, similar to something like Satisfactory.
-Content goes DEEP. Relative to other colony management games, this one has the depth that I have been craving for a long time. Many tiers to unlock. After 40 hours, I am still unlocking things on my main playthrough.
-Beautiful. This game's graphics are quite good relative to other colony management games. If your computer can handle it (see memory issue), you can get some really amazing shots, which the game encourages through one type of the events.
-MUSIC. The music in this game is top tier. Really ties the ambience together. The kind of music that I get the urge to pull up on youtube even when I'm not playing.

Cons:
-I hesitate to put this in the cons, because a lot of times it feels pretty good. But sometimes the UI can feel very clunky. Particularly around trading, which is an enormous part of the game. This could be a user error issue, but even if it is, that means it's not an intuitive system.

Do not buy this game right now.  It took me hours to figure out how to get it to run, and I'm not at all confident I could do it again if I close the game.

Their broken launcher. 

Workarounds: Reinstall uplay, validate game files via steam, turn off achievement synchronization via steam settings and uplay settings.  Open everything (steam, uplay, anno.exe) as admin.  When it says the sync failed, press skip.  If it doesn't work, restart pc and start again. Did this several times and somehow it launched.

But you know what? I did it because this is the best Anno in the series, I have hundred of hours on this game and only fond memories of it.
If there is one city builder I would urge you to play and adore (or one Anno game) it's this one, this game is awesome and I will play it many hundred hours more.
I don't care about the drama surrounding the game or the money you have to spend on it, I'm damn glad they supported this game for 4 years worth of content and still going strong (although I don't think they can cram another year, it's already starting to feel like too much? I can't imagine adding more stuff).
I like this game a lot and I like all of the dlc from Year 1, 2, 3 and 4 (there's 3 each year).
Not all of them are great, but I would say each one of them adds something you either use consistently or it's a good one off adventure.
I'm missing a few minor cosmetic ones, but other than that, yeah, it's a great and relaxing game with hundreds of hours of content to enjoy.

I'm obviously biased and you probably have to try it out for yourself, if you've never played an Anno game it's like a city builder with hints of Factorio in a sense that you're setting up the industry and goods your people will consume, which in turn will give you money.
Practically the loop is like this: You start on your first Island (you can colonize more) and using the money you have, you build your first houses and services.
With your workforce set up, you start to build your basic industry and get to manufacturing building materials or goods that your population will consume.
The people living your city will pay you money for the services they use and the goods they consume and after a while you can upgrade these people to workers, which will require more (or different) goods but will also unlock new buildings where they are used. It's a tricky balance especially deciding when to upgrade your population and how many of them.
If you've never played an Anno game however, play this one, I've played a few of them and this is my favourite by far.
There's also mods on the nexus to tailor the experience to you, Spice it up is a good place to start.

That said, if you want to burn money, get the Complete Edition, I know it's a lot of money, even with 50% discount it's 60 Euros, but trust me, it's 4 season passes and they're all at least good, not all are perfect but they're worth it in my opinion.

Anno 1800 is a lovely game, you can tell the studio poured their soul into this one, easily on of the best in the franchise. It's expansive and at the same time very approachable, because it give you every tool you need to be succesfull. Later in the review I give a small overview of the main DLCs but I want to say that, while they are mostly good and they make the game better, they are not essential, the base game stands very well on its own.

[h1] The Core Review [/h1]

You beging the game with a humble outpost in a humble island and a ship and work your way through the fast technological progress of the victorian era and expand your empire to all the continents of the world (there are 4 with all the dlcs), with production chains getting more and more complex, and sometimes requiring  products from other continents, so you will also need to build an extensive trade network, that in turn will require you to build defensive fleets to escort the trading ships and then eventually take out the pirates and maybe some of the competition.
Speaking of competition, you face up to 3 AI (or human players) besides the pirate factions. The game is very customizable, you can choose the characters that you face, and their difficulty, or just turn them off completely. Once in the game you can choose to go against them and conquer their island with your navy or by buying their shares and take over that way. You can also work with them, become trade partners and allies even.
One thing I don't like about this game is the combat, it's mostly a headbut contest of your navies (and airforce if you have that dlc) against static island defences, it's just not fun tbh.

[h1] DLC Mini Guide and Review [/h1]
Now that most of the base is covered I will try and give you a quick rundown of the dlc:

[b][u] Season 1: [/u][/b]
[list]
[*]Sunken Treasure: This one is great, you get a huge island in a new continent, Cape Trelawny, to play with and you get a boat that can gather junk to transform into great items. 
[*]Botanica: This one is less impactful, you get a botanical garden that works as a museum or zoo, giving more attraction to your city.
[*]The Passage: With this one you unlock a new continent, the artic, a pretty unforgiving region, but you can get some gas in there to build gas powered power plants, it also used to be the only way to get airships, but that's no longer the case.
[/list]

[b][u] Season 2: [/u][/b]
[list]
[*]Seat of Power: You get a new palace building to boost the economy of one of your islands and a Local Department (a micro palace) for the rest, with a limited boost range.
[*]Bright Harvest: Ah, now this is the best dlc and one that I'd consider close to essential, it gives you silos to boost the production rate of animal farms and later tractors to boost the farms, making them take less space in the island, that is not so much of a problem in Trelawny but it could get pretty bad in the Old and New World.
[*]Land of Lions: I'm kinda conflicted with this one, it's quite a hefty piece of content, it adds the 4th and last continent of the game: Enbesa, based on Ethiopia, It looks and plays great, with unique water management mechanics for the farms, it also gives you the Reaserch Institute, it can allow the production of some New World products in the Old World and changing the fertilities of the island (and even more, but those two are the main ones I use). However, it's very story heavy, it's a great story but it's out of place in a game where you could be handling many different fires while having to follow a guy around that wants to tell you how great the ancient walls of the are.
[/list]

[b][u] Season 3: [/u][/b]
[list]
[*]Docklands: A simple DLC, adds a new dock where you trade with a special NPC for rare goods, it's great for complementig production.
[*]Tourist Season: A fun and also smaller dlc, you get a new population, the tourists with their own mechanics (like restaurants that reduce good consumption in a radius) and unique needs to be fulfilled. You also get a new monument: The Iron Tower (yes, an Eifel Tower copy).
[*]The High Life: Adds Skyscrapers to the game, an update for the investors and engineers that increase the density of the city while adding shopping malls (that work like restaurants) and some new production chains. It also adds a new monument: Skyline Tower that acts a huge investor residence (and also looks cool).
[/list]

[b][u] Season 4: [/u][/b]
[list]
[*]Seeds of Change: This whole season is focused on the New World, in this one you get the Hacienda, remember I mentioned space problems in this continent? This is the first solution, a city within a city that has smaller and also unique farms.
[*]Empire of the Skies: This one pretty much makes the artic redundant, as you get to build bigger and better air ships, adding air combat into the game too. It also allows population sharing between the islands in the New World thank god.
[*]New World RIsing: The final big expansion DLC, it's the cherry on top of a great season of dlc, it adds more islands in the New World and, in particular, Manola, the Crown Falls of the continent, giving you A LOT of space to work with, it also adds a new population tier to the New World and monument, the stadium.

Core Game is focus intensive resource management industrial revolution based city builder. Most of game focuses around trade and supply chains over multiple islands and regions. Combat is limited to Naval and Airship warfare on a mostly simplistic basis. Core game has a steep learning curve and takes easily dozens of hours to master. Visually beautiful but system resource intensive, will eat most systems with less than 16Gb of RAM late game.

Absolute garbage launcher, though. Even through Steam, you'll still need Ubisoft Disconnect, and to be signed in to it.

You can hack you way around this by always using ""offline mode"", but then saves won't sync unless you re-enable online mode temporarily, which in turn of course requires the launcher to restart for 20 seconds or so.

I bought it unaware of the defiantly sleazy tactics [*apparently] used by Ubisoft before (and now after) they decided they could sell their title elsewhere, then when THAT didn't work, shamelessly return to Steam WHILE [*apparently, as seen in dozens and dozens of User Reviews you can read yourself] breaching the promise of providing DLC content to people who pre-ordered the game on *this* platform before Ubisoft decided they could do better for themselves on their own [*terrible] platform and the [*not as terrible, but still pretty terrible] infamous Epic Store. how embarrassing. 

no, this isn't about that, this is about my experiences attempting to simply run the game I purchased yesterday. first it wouldn't launch at all. then after reading on a third-party website to try and open the .exe as admin, the game TRIED to launch after first opening Ubisoft Connect [*ugh], which promptly demanded a key password I did not have. I checked in the [*remember, QUITE terrible] Ubisoft launcher, where it had no idea I'd bought the title among the other handful of games the cursed thing DID admit I owned. 

THE SOLUTION TO THIS I GRATEFULLY RECEIVED FROM A STEAM USER WHOSE HANDLE I CAN'T REMEMBER: I HAD TO LAUNCH BOTH STEAM *and* UBISOFT CONNECT AS ADMINISTRATOR, *then* RUN THE GAME, WHICH DID FINALLY WORK. 

but before I came back to it, I gave up for a  few hours, totally furious and in awe of just how awful this company really IS. it's a meme in itself that Ubisoft's The Worst, but time and again it just proves itself true. it's totally true. I have no idea why. counting this disaster, I've now four clear and irreparably-damaging experiences of anger, frustration and even rage with Ubisoft products (not to mention Ubisoft practices, which have become by now legendary.)

there's being incompetent and then there's Ubisoft, who seem to act both incompetently, cynically socially-pandering AND aggressively anti-consumer, which is the worst triptych look a AAA video game company can have.

Shame on U, Ubisoft. you may OWN brands we love, but they're not yours. you can't ruin them, despite your very best efforts. the talented developers deserve SO MUCH BETTER than you're clearly willing to provide in this decade.

I couldn't explain why, but i just couldn't stop staring at the little town with the sunset in the background and the music playing while i also heard the sea and some birds chirping. 

Long story short, went back to steam, refunded the standard edition, and went straight to buy the year 4 complete edition. This special it was, and i can feel already that i will be playing for a long time.

HOWEVER Anno 1800 is its only saving grace. Along with the other anno entries. Not because i'm a city builder fan (i like many genres of games) but because the game offers a solid experience with a fascinating game play loop that can keep you entertained for hours.

The Steam RE-release has been a bit shaky with not being able to launch the game. But after a day or two i am able to play it again. Negative reviews i'm seeing is mostly around that, and people not being able to find the DLC's at a discount or something? 
LET ME SAY THIS. I've bought DLCs on both a mix of Ubisoft store AND Steam store (while it was off steams market) and i've had NO ISSUES WITH THE GAMEs ADDONS. I got season pass 1 to 4 and i've been pretty overwhelmed with content in each season.

With that out the way, its time for a well constructed and insightful review...

If you like city builders with resource management, multiple different build orders to experiment with, procedural generated maps.... You will enjoy this game.
Ubisoft bad, Anno devs still passionate - it shows.

Thats the review.

Developers need to not just 'make a game' and assume that gamers will understand their logic. They need to make a game assuming that the gamer understands 'NOTHING'. It is a simple concept us programmers in the real world understand and the good ones use.
So back to ANNO 1800 - started ok and got to 'You need to make 4 sails'... How?.. no clues, no instructions - nothing... This where the developers screw up. There is no logic. They 'know' what I have in my inventory when the 'Message' pops up... so why don't they just say 'You need to do X/Y/Z' .. Spent 3 hours messing about trying to find out how to make a SAIL.. My Logic says 'I need to get the knitting factory (that I have) to make sails... or need more poxy knitting factories... Gave up in the end. Deleted game.
In FACTORIO every part you need is clearly defined as to 'HOW YOU MAKE IT' - 'WHAT STUFF YOU NEED' - 'HOW LONG IT TAKES'.. etc etc.. 
We all love to play games online, but if we spend half the gaming time in forums / Wiki / Google trying to work out how to make an illogical coders BRAIN from a BANANA then it's no fun.
Applications I build are built to specification from the client, but HALF of the development goes into 'blind user testing' to actually understand what an end user is 'doing' and how they interpret what is supposed to be happening with what they are doing, which may not be what the client thinks they should be doing based on their specification of the application. 
All pure logic and developers need to put themselves in the mind of old gits like me that don't understand that 'To Make a Sail' I need to do.... what was it now...?? I forgot... 'Google it?'... bollocks... Made a cheese sandwich and launched another Sat elite in FACTORIO.

This game intends to merge all previous Anno games to bring the ultimate building simulator experience. It is very refreshing to see they've abandoned some of the things they did on Anno 2205 since that game was like cyanide. The fact they removed multiplayer and made it a solo contest shows the derailment of Anno's true core. Now that we are back on track, we can finally appreciate the franchise for what it is. We can engage in majestic naval combat, set up our trade routes, and explore new continents/areas, bringing an enriching experience to the table.

 I know the DLCs were shamelessly created to get more money, but at least they should more honest about it instead of doing things incognito. If the game is going to be shadowed, why not remove it completely and give us a refund so we can all go to UPlay?

I'm loving the game, and I was a screaming fanboy with absurdly high expectations ever since I first saw promotional artwork.

We all know that ubisoft is a scummy company, but one thing is clear: Anno 1800 is an amazing game! I played all Anno games from 1701 on and this one is the best so far and its not even close. I also see a lot of people complain about the DLC prices, but clearly none of them actually played the DLC. IMO ALL of the DLCs are well worth their money. The expansions add literally entire new worlds to the game, tons and tons of content, including more production chains, more regions, more population and so on... I would pay double for the content DLCs and it would still be worth the money. You can spend 50 hrs in a continous game and still have not yet unlocked all the content, there is so much.

Concluding let me say this: Don't give this game a bad review because of ubisoft dumb stuff. After all it is not possible for most studios to publish a game on their own. The team behind Anno has shown time and time again that they love their games and put a boat load of work into them, even pushing updates for Anno 2070 and Anno 1404 to keep them playable years after release. Stop crying about a missing discount when there is tons of games that sell insanely expensive DLC with no content.

In short:
The last update really screwed over a lot of people, especially those who are using mods (myself included) - its sad that something like this happens when there is a huge company behind it, but well.. here we are...

All in all the game is great fun and the difficulty scaling is almost perfect. Early game is classical anno gameplay but later down the road it scales up until it feels something like cookie clicker - you are never done optimizing things. The fun only goes up when playing with a good friend and managing your empire.

Personal Opinion:
Buy now (since it is on sale) but wait some time until mods are updated. The game truly shines with all the mods available. Also pls Ubisoft consider adding workshop support!",1670693048,1670693048,True,2,0,0.525417327880859375,0,True,False,False

A massive scale (especially with the Add-Ons, which I recommend wholeheartedly), a good amount of complexity without being intimidating, fun features, great graphics, and simply a whole lot of stuff to enjoy in Singleplayer and Multiplayer makes this an essential game if you even have the slightest interest in the genre. There is a campaign with a story and there are custom game setups, multiplayer modes and scenarios  - more than enough to keep you engaged for a long, long time! Building an empire in a never-ending singleplayer sandbox game is my jam and I can easily play this for hundreds of hours! 

The blueprint mode is one of the best Quality of Life features they ever implemented in the series (I wish you could save blueprints/layouts, that would be amazing!) and the economy and the different regions make the game exciting every time you play it. 

You need to provide your people with food, drink and shelter. Produce beer and bread and schnapps and wine and cigars and sewing machines and rum and coats and so much more. Keep them happy with churches, theatres, hospitals, schools or a botanical garden, amongst other things. You can settle in the ""Old World"" (basically Europe), the ""New World"" (Carribean), the ""Land of the Lions"" (Africa) and the Antarctic. You can build on a massive island in ""Cape Trelawney"" and construct a mega city. You can have tourists visit your version of the ""Eiffel Tower"", host the World Fair and build yourself a huge palace, right next to your big zoo or museum. You can send your ships on expeditions to find rare animals or relics, you can dive for treasure, fly with airships, build a train network or a bus network and even a mail network, you can build haciendas and artistic cities or a massive warfleet! Drill for oil or plant peppers and wheat or hunt some animals for fur. And don't forget to build a fire station! Build an economic super empire or simply conquer the world by force. Find your playstyle and enjoy! 

Anno 1800 is the best Anno they ever made, it is one of the best city-builders ever made and probably one of the best games ever to come out of Germany! I hear that the Ubisoft Launcher (fuck those fucking launchers) causes trouble for some people but I luckily enough never encountered any issues.

Anno 1800 remains an excellent city builder , has good graphics , and a challenging gameplay. You may indeed struggle quite a bit in order to actually master the game's mechanics , invest your starting money efficently and increase goods productions in order to come on top. But you may also want to have nice , relaxing momment , dedicated purely to city building whithout worrying about potential threats such as pirates or IA Players , which is possible , by deactivating them. The game does allow you to play on your terms.

Quite a lot of DLC were published over the last few years , adding contents , from simple cosmetics packs to enhance your city's appeal , to new lands , goods , way of producing , and challenge , having all four Season Pass , i do enjoy most of them.

As for Ubisoft, and what they have pulled with their return to Steam, they have accomplished at least two things for certain. 

1) I will never preorder another Ubisoft game, regardless of platform or game/series
2) I will never buy another game through UbiConnect again, so they had better plan on staying on Steam now, because I stopped buying games off of EGS almost two years ago due to their horrendous customer service and I won't be back there either.

I am like many others have preordered on Steam to avoid using Epic store. Furthermore I didnt preorder from Ubisoft directly either because they need to see how greedy and unfair their practices are having a direct result on their sales. I'd rather let Steam get a cut than give them ALL the money because they want to hold awesome games hostage on other stores. No matter how hard you try EXCLUSIVITY on PC is not going to work in the long run. You can take epic's fortnite cash as much as you want but if you keep removing games from Steam you will keep losing consumers left and right.

I am not even sure all people are gonna see this review lol. It seems like its only those who preordered it can see this page on Steam. Anyway the game is really good and I was waiting for the next Anno and was not dissapointed .

Anno 1800 is one of the greatest strategy games of all time. This comes from someone who has put buckets of time into almost every major RTS franchise. The game strikes a perfect balance on resource and people management, and has an incredible amount of depth while still being easy to get into.

As a content creator for Anno specifically (and some other things sometimes), I can say with confidence that this game is worth considering for all fans of strategy. The devs are great, the community is great, and the game is downright fantastic.

For DLC recommendations I would buy the season passes if they are cheaper or just the DLC contained in those passes, the rest is cosmetic trash.",1670538230,1670538284,True,215,17,0.878351330757141113,0,True,False,False

Edit (8 Dec, 2022): I think Anno 1800 is the best Anno yet and I think it is simply one of the best city builders.
 
The graphics are gorgeous, there is a lot of replay-ability (even without the DLCs and even more if you buy one or more of the DLCs), I think the production chains are well thought out and balanced as well as easy to learn but sometimes hard to master, especially because if you build too much buildings you will not be able to have a positive balance of your finances for very long.
 
The pirates are very annoying at times, but you can turn them off if you want to. The interactions with the NPCs are ok, but could be more interesting, sometimes they are even annoying, for example when the Captain asks you every 5 minutes if you want to launch an expedition. 
 
The maps are of good size even though sometimes I wish there was an option to have even bigger maps. I really like that you don't just build in the ""Old World"" but at some point also start expanding in the ""New World '' which then has its own production chains, some of which produce goods you need for production chains in the old world.
 
I like the concept of oil and electricity even though it can be very unpleasant to add the train tracks to an existing city if you haven't planned for it at the start and need to move a lot of buildings around, but it is well worth it, electricity increases the production output of buildings by a lot and oil helps a lot getting more out of less fields by using machines to harvest.
 
If you are a new player and get one of the deals that come up these days, where you get the base game and all DLCs for less than the game cost when it first got released, then I recommend you first play a match without the DLCs turned on. Then repeat this and add some DLCs until you have them all turned on. I recommend this because the base game alone has a lot to learn on its own and much more with the DLCs turned on, so if you have your first playthrough with all DLCs turned on it might be too much.",1594388582,1670538230,True,2,0,0.52449566125869751,0,True,False,False

A game that's all about production chains, trade routes and city planning; where you have a lot of stuff going on at the same time, and even AI opponents, but the game is still relaxing and follows the player pace.

You can spend hours focusing on solving one specific issue or improving a specific chain, and after finishing this you have a long selection of other tasks to attend to. You always have something to do, but you can do it at your own pace. That's what I liked about Anno 1701 and Anno 1404, and it's executed even better here.

Many of the new ideas that were tried on Anno 2205 - the most ""different"" game in the series - have been tweaked and improved, and feel much more polished here, feeling like they belong. A few of them were discarded (like the battle maps and the teletransporting goods).

The atmosphere on this game is pretty good, and the first-person mode (Ctrl+Shift+R by default) is a fun way to see your town come to life; I think every city building game needs a feature like this. The music is great, as are the sound effects. The voice acting can get repetitive, though, as you'll hear the same phrases quite often after playing for a while. The day/night cycle is also really neat, though you'll probably find yourself skipping the night-mode while building.

If you're new to Anno, the lack of an active pause might feel weird for the genre, and might seem contrary to what I mentioned earlier about the game respecting the player pace. But the game is slow-paced enough that you'll soon notice that you can take a long time to react to something and it's alright. Though it would certainly be a good addition.

[b]December 2022 - Update:[/b] After four years of fantastic DLCs and post-launch support, I can safely say that I consider Anno 1800 to be the best city-building game out there today.

 Anno 1800 continues the series' long tradition of city-building/economy planning games, and places you in the middle of a Victorian-inspired world to make a thriving trade empire. 

Micromanagement of economic chains is very deep, down to the layout of crop fields and employment of specialists and bonuses to boost production, but keeping things balanced and raking in profits will take great attention to detail. 
Meeting the needs of your population will gradually get more complicated, going from farmers to workers, workers to Artisans, and so on mirroring the real-world industrial revolution. as the game progresses, competition over limited resources and prime islands for colonization will lead you into conflict with other charter companies,, and it will be up to you to decide if trade or war(or even a hostile takeover of company assets) will work best.

the only major downside is that The late game can get repetitive, but DLCs add a lot of variety to ways you can play once you've taken a foothold.

The only problem is I played too much beta games that I do not have the feeling to play it again when it is released. :(

It has terrific music, graphics as well as playability

The season 1 DLCs were great with a lot of new stuff.
Season 2 is also very interesing ( The land of the lion isn't released yet). 

There is one thing I don't like. You can recruit specialists at NPC stations. But if you want a specific character you have to role the random button as long as the specialist is offered. It would be much better if you could buy all specialists whenever you want. (maybe by treble/quadruple the price)

+ Endless
+ easy to learn, hard to master
+ Graphics
+ Support

Update:
Anno 1800 is the best anno of all time. The seasons are very good. They add a lot of new stuff. The devs are in a regular contact to the community, so they develope what most of the players want and need.

Also the mod compatibility is very nice. What the devs didnt do, you can add as a mod.

As a game, it is excellent. I left a bad review before, as it was ridden with bugs and unpolished mechanics. Is one of those games that survive from selling expensiveish DLC, but I can credit that they usually add new cool features (so pe, each region has its own quirks and mechanics so how you play the game in each region is going to be different).

Music is good, visuals are gorgeous, and if you like Victorian stile you will find yourself staring at the buildings, ships and people on the street all the time. It is also stable (played 12 hours straight, no crashes) and it is optimized. I used a business class laptop from 2016, and sure it got hot as hell and had to play on low settings, but it worked and the movement and animations played smooth.

The expedition mechanics are super cool and it feels a little bit like you are on one of Joules' s Verne adventures (or similar adventure novels from the XIX century).

Another thing I appreciated is how early XIX century the game looks when you start, and how ""near XX century"" it looks by the end of the game. It really feels like you progressed and advanced a lot trough the era.

This is a real good game. If you like other anno games you' ll probably really enjoy this!",1555587445,1657792831,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What you do in the game: Start with a boat and some resources. Settle land. Farmers want stuff. You give them what they want. Oh well now they want more stuff. Get bricks, sausages, and other resources going. Give to Workers. Workers happy. But now they want to be more creative. Boom, the cycle goes on and its addicting.

What you feel while playing: Dopamine hits when you grow your population. Increase income. Explore new regions. Go on Expeditions! Acquire specialists to improve industries. Set up trades to satisfy exotic necessities. Discover animals, botany, artifacts for your zoo, flower garden, and museum! Upgrade to steam powered machines. Build a railroad! Have festivals, publish newspapers, invite tourists to your beatiful settlement. Minimize and consolidate for efficiency; Maximize profits! Be diplomatic, or be a tyrant with a magnificent fleet. Fulfill quests, barter with merchants!

All this while having moments of frustration, sorrow from disasters or losing a trade ship to pirates, overwhelming management issues on your islands, etc. But DAMN is this the most exquisitely crafted city builder/management game ever.

Play this with a friend for dozens of hours of fun on one session. Only to begin another after 30 to 80 hours. Never stop grooming your settlements. There's also mods!

This review, considering the game is unpurchasable right now, is just here so that people lurking my account or looking through my reviews are aware that getting Epic games freebies and purchasing games through their platforms is supporting exclusivity deals for PC and supporting a sub par game store platform which doesn't allow user-made reviews by default and allows devs to toggle off reviews at any time which is not consumer-friendly at all.

I know that Steam having a quasi monopoly on game distribution isn't ideal either but Epic games approach isn't really helping either. Convince your users with a superior platform and your publishers with better deals, not with exclusivity deals.

Edit: Over 100 hours in the game. Still love it, the production chain management is great. The game has a slow build up so even if you're new to the series it is easy to learn. 

As the game progresses you expand to new islands and regions which are different maps. You can jump between any map instantly with zero load. It can be very fun to setup supply chains, trade routes/deals and mix in some light naval combat, but still require tactics such as positions, item upgrades, and diplomacy. 

There is great end game content which greatly expands if you get any of the DLC. The DLC is primarily 3 seasons each with 3 DLC packs. Most of the packs offer great content but some are stronger than others and some such as much of season one is highly recommended. 

My main issue is starting new games is a bit slow after you played a few times with the first hour of gameplay even as high speed. Which is worse in multiplayer since you can't fast-forward.",1591823325,1637019679,True,2,0,0.524245679378509521,0,True,False,False

If it weren't for one thing: The Coop that's still missing. I've been waiting since release for this but it just ain't coming. keeps being postponed for other DLCs i'm absolutely not interested in. And to put the iceing on the cake, i've even heard that they're going to offer it as a paid DLC which would be the breaking point for me at least...

To be fair to the game itself though: The looks, the mechanics, the progression system, everything is just amazing. 
I just want to be able to enjoy the game with my buddies which unfortunately still isn't possible at this point. 

Which is, why i'm not able to recommend this game even though it's an amazing single player experience.

You do need patience to play this.  Unlike other strategy games, I felt the urgency to rush to beat the AI opponents, but unless you're playing with extreme difficulty settings and hard AI, you can be more passive and casual to build up an evolving economy and empire.

I feel weird rewriting my review for this game, seeing as how you can't even buy Anno 1800 on Steam anymore.  However, I feel it is fair to do so as my initial negative review is outdated. I first wrote my review after playing 275 hours.  I'm up to 701 hours since then.

I initially gave this game a bad review because the game at its release was riddled with SO MANY bugs.  Which was a shame because at its core there was a great, fun game there.  I had so much fun when the game worked properly.  It's just that the bugs would completely ruin your experience.

But credit must be given to Blue Byte and all the tech support people, as those bugs have been cleaned up (at least those initial ones that plagued me and others).  It took time, and it got frustrating sometimes waiting for certain bugs to finally be fixed, but the game was never abandoned.  It was constantly patched to the point where the game is now everything it was supposed to be.  

The aesthetics of the 1800s is beautiful, the mechanics sharp and easy to learn, the game play satisfying.  If this ever comes back on Steam, I would highly recommend it for anyone who likes City Builders, Tycoon Games, or generally appreciates the 1800s era.",1565633839,1628348747,True,0,0,0.621349871158599854,9,True,False,False

They took what was an already great game at release and have since then put out an insane amount of DLC content that really adds so much to this game. We are currently deep into ""Season 3"" of their DLC compilation and still have a big pack on the way this year. If you have every enjoyed an Anno game before or just like strategy/economy/builder games in general then you owe it to yourself to try this. 

The only downside ofcourse is that this game looks like it will not be coming to Steam anytime soon or ever. It has been years now since release and the developers have pretty much stated that it wont be happening. People like me are able to play and review it here because we pre-ordered it back in the day and those preorders were honored even after Ubi made the deal with Epic. Now, I would suggest that you just buy this game directly from the Ubisoft store and bypass Epic store completely. There is 0 reason to buy it there as you will still need to use the Ubi launcher on top of Epic if you get it through them. Also, I would hate to support Epic and their practices.

All in all, this game has an ungodly amount of content, depth, and replay value especially if you get all the DLC that has come out thus far and is still to be released.

Set in the industrial age, this game has an amazing atmosphere, beautiful music, great gameplay and gorgeous graphics.. all these add to a wonderful experience in the city-building, resource management and simulation genre.

You can play this game in single player and multiplayer mode (coop, vs or anything in between.. meaning, you can have a trade-deal, but actually despise each other.. mutual benefits, you know.)

Anno 1800 gives you the option to start a campaign with an interesting enough story where you set out to colonize new islands and the New World. It teaches you the ropes in the first missions and guides you towards a wonderful and radiating city in the industrial era of humanity.

Besides the campaign, you have sandbox mode (where you'll spend most of your time). You can adjust many options before starting the game. From cosmetics (which character/colour you'll be, ship designs (if unlocked) and more) to game events (how many disasters happen, quest frequency, ...) to AI opponents (other civilizations, pirates, traders, ..). It really lets you decide how you want to play. Do you want to rush your way to victory or enjoy building your thriving society? Every time you build your colony, it'll be different. From starting locations to available resources, it all adds up to an amazing replayability.

At the time I'm writing this review, there are quite some DLC's available. All add fun and new content and are worth the money, imo. Sadly, Anno 1800 is not available on Steam anymore; hopefully it'll return in the near future so it can reach more people.

My closing comments: a brilliant successor to Anno 1404 (yes, I don't count Anno 2070 and Anno 2205 to my list; I didn't like the futuristic setting) and if you love city-building games, this'll be a worthy addition to your game collection.

Excellent ANNO styled city builder, engaging, and sucks you in. Fans will enjoy getting this!

[b]What it does really good:[/b]
Everything ANNO does, it does better. It provides a much deeper gameplay experience when compared to other ANNO games in the franchise.

[b]What it does bad:[/b]
Some non-sensical NPC banter here and there from the AI. May frustrate some, or be entertaining to others. Meh...

[b]Who does the game cater to:[/b]
Gamers, ofcourse. Naturally, ANNO fans will love this.

[b]Better than competitors:[/b]
Maybe. It is an improvement on the previous ANNO games, except maybe ANNO 1404, but lets just say I like being nostalgic. But in all seriousness, ANNO 1800 is as close as you can get to that feeling with an updated engine.

I was never interested in any other game modes then sandbox mode, so I'll focus on this part of the game.

Opposed to Anno 1404, the game has expanded it's features of building to a more realistic setting, meaning you now need actual workforce in different classes to produce materials and goods. Although this adds another dimension to the game, I'm not sure I like it as much as Anno 1404. Since this also means that on each island you need to produce, you need workforce and these people also have demands. This adds a lot of challenge and complexity to the game.

Meaning you now need to send out ships to those production islands, because they contain workforce with needs too.

Although I like the more graphical detail and various new production facilities. At the moment, I'm missing those grand Cathedrals that replace all functionality of everything that is necessary to keep your people happy. Meaning that you need to consider additional space while building villages for things such as a pub, hospital, university, museum etc.

At this moment I still prefer 1404 above 1800. Maybe I need to give it a little more time.

Otherwise hey it's a shiny and content-rich anno game (build production chains on islands to support ever-demaning tiers of population, optimize islands and trade between islands/regions to create a more complex logistic chain in the service of your population). Combat is somehow worse than 2205, which is impressive, story is non-existent. But the music is calming and the graphics are nice and if you want a good anno sandbox game and you're done with 2205 hey this is a pretty cool return to the very very cartoonified history of the anno series. 

Live-servicifed since 2/4 of regions are locked behind DLCs. And just so, much, content. There's a newspaper to manage, expeditions to undertake, random booster items to min-max, a slightly obnoxious trade interface to wrangle, and just a ton of random quests to move ships from point a to point b while you're waiting to stockpile things. No radio towers at least, I guess.

This is Anno and Anno is a good game.

Sadly, Ubisoft removed the game from stream. Which made buying DLC's a pain in the ass. You have to find the link to every single DLC. luckily this game has an AMAZING community that shared the link to every DLC in one place!

If Ubisoft decides to get their ♥♥♥♥ together, I will turn this thumb down to a thumb UP!

So I just finally cracked and bought the DLC for this..I was apprehensive to as DLC these days feels like a huge risk..been burned too many times by over confident publishers abusing the DLC concept but as they are currently on sale I thought it was time I tried. Oh boy was it a good move. I Opted for the Season Pass 1 and Agriculture add ons as they seemed the most useful and least cosmetically driven. The content you get is impressively well integrated, can highly reccomend checking them out when you can. Once again, this game is an impressive feat of RTS bliss but you already knew that. 

Fuck Ubisoft with on so many levels but especially for removing this game from steam in such a sneaky and shifty way. Pricks.

/edit

Can people stop thumbing this game down for ubisoft's awful exclusivity manoeuvre? These reviews don't reflect the content of the game whatsoever and are detrimental.
Been really excited for Anno 1800 since it was announced and I gotta say it lived up to expectations.
The scale of this game is really astonishing, if you ever played the Settlers or Age Of Empires and reached a point where the game stops as there nothing to do; this game never feels like it reaches that..not for a very long time anyway..and I mean a very long time.
Its a true pity that the publisher has pulled this off steam, there's no good reason to do so and they should feel as stupid as they've made themselves look with that decision. the diplomacy, tech tree and progression here feels so fluid but still challenging as the focus is much more around economy rather that military like Age Of Empires, making for a much more strategic long term game. If you love the feeling of The Settlers but wished it went on for real world hours/days, this is the game for you.

Pros: Massive scale, satisfying progression and emphasis on economics/diplomacy. Beautiful graphics and soundtrack/sound design. 

Cons: Pig headed publishers neglecting the greater audience's experience in a pathetic effort to gain better analytics through Epic Store and their own in house distribution service. Terrible move, ubi.",1555614097,1598988605,True,7,1,0.553978979587554932,0,True,False,False

This game is amazing!  Its beautiful in not only the art but the small details.  First person view is amazing and you can actually walk through your cities.  Supply chains are complex and challenging in the beginning but become easy as your empire grows.  Naval combat is spread sheet driven head to head.  You can augment your ships with slotables and strategize better.  That detail is nice.

However, it's the best Anno game, and therefore also one of my personal favorite games.  It lacked a few important features at launch that required some monotonous micromanagement (or frustration), but nearly all of those shortcomings have since been addressed/solved, and it's really just an excellent game.
