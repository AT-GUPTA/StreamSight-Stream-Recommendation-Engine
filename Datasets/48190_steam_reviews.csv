""Assassin's Creed Brotherhood"" is an action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and released in 2010. Serving as the direct sequel to ""Assassin's Creed II,"" the game continues the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze as he confronts the Templar threat in Renaissance-era Rome. Here's a review highlighting the positives and negatives of ""Assassin's Creed Brotherhood"":

Positives:

1. **Expanded Gameplay Mechanics**: ""Brotherhood"" introduces several new gameplay mechanics and features, building upon the foundation established in its predecessor. The addition of the Brotherhood system allows players to recruit and train fellow Assassins, who can assist in combat, perform stealth missions, and aid in the defense of key locations.

2. **Rich and Detailed Setting**: Set in the vibrant and sprawling city of Rome during the Renaissance, ""Brotherhood"" offers a meticulously crafted open-world environment filled with historical landmarks, bustling streets, and hidden secrets. The city comes alive with its diverse districts, architectural marvels, and dynamic day-night cycle, creating an immersive and atmospheric backdrop for Ezio's adventures.

3. **Engaging Multiplayer Mode**: ""Brotherhood"" introduces a groundbreaking multiplayer mode that challenges players to outwit and outmaneuver each other in competitive matches. With a variety of game modes, character classes, and customization options, the multiplayer mode offers a unique and addictive experience that complements the single-player campaign.

4. **Compelling Storyline and Characters**: The narrative of ""Brotherhood"" is rich in intrigue, betrayal, and political maneuvering, as Ezio seeks to liberate Rome from the grip of the Templars and uncover the secrets of the ancient order. The game features a diverse cast of characters, each with their own motivations and agendas, adding depth and complexity to the storyline.

Negatives:

1. **Repetitive Mission Structure**: While ""Brotherhood"" offers a variety of missions and objectives, some players may find the mission structure to be somewhat repetitive, particularly in the side quests and optional activities. Many missions follow a formulaic pattern of infiltration, assassination, or escort, leading to a sense of monotony over time.

2. **Technical Issues and Performance**: Like its predecessors, ""Brotherhood"" is not without its technical issues, including occasional framerate drops, graphical glitches, and AI inconsistencies. While these issues are relatively minor, they can detract from the overall immersion and polish of the game.

3. **Limited Innovation**: While ""Brotherhood"" improves upon many aspects of its predecessor, some players may feel that the game lacks significant innovation or evolution in terms of gameplay mechanics and storytelling. The core gameplay loop remains largely unchanged from previous entries, with incremental improvements rather than groundbreaking innovations.

4. **Pacing Issues**: Some players may feel that the pacing of ""Brotherhood"" is uneven, with certain story segments and missions dragging on longer than necessary. The game's open-world structure allows for freedom and exploration, but it can also lead to pacing issues and a lack of narrative momentum at times.

In conclusion, ""Assassin's Creed Brotherhood"" builds upon the strengths of its predecessor while introducing new gameplay mechanics, a richly detailed setting, and a compelling multiplayer mode. Despite its occasional technical issues and pacing issues, the game offers a captivating and immersive experience that will appeal to fans of the series and newcomers alike. With its engaging storyline, dynamic gameplay, and memorable characters, ""Brotherhood"" stands as a worthy addition to the ""Assassin's Creed"" franchise.",1708243365,1708243365,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Introduction:
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood marks a pivotal moment in the acclaimed franchise, expanding upon the foundations laid by its predecessors while introducing new gameplay mechanics and a captivating narrative. As an avid fan of the Assassin's Creed series, I found myself enthralled by the immersive world of Renaissance Italy and the thrilling adventures of Ezio Auditore da Firenze. In this review, I'll highlight the strengths of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood while acknowledging a few minor shortcomings.

Seamless Integration of Story and Gameplay:
One of the standout features of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is its seamless integration of story and gameplay. The narrative picks up directly after the events of Assassin's Creed II, with Ezio embarking on a quest for vengeance against the nefarious Templar order. The stakes are higher than ever as Ezio navigates the political intrigue of Rome, recruits allies to his cause, and expands the influence of the Assassin Brotherhood. The story unfolds organically through a combination of main missions, side quests, and optional objectives, keeping players engaged and invested in the outcome.

Dynamic Open-World Exploration:
Rome serves as the sprawling playground for Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, offering a vibrant and immersive open-world environment to explore. From the bustling streets of the city center to the sprawling countryside and ancient ruins, every corner of Rome is teeming with life and historical detail. The parkour mechanics are as fluid and intuitive as ever, allowing players to effortlessly navigate the urban landscape with grace and precision. Whether scaling towering landmarks or blending seamlessly into crowds, the sense of freedom and immersion is unparalleled.

Strategic Depth and Resource Management:
In Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, players are tasked with rebuilding and managing the Assassin Brotherhood's headquarters, the Monteriggioni villa. This introduces a layer of strategic depth to the gameplay, as players must recruit and train new assassins, assign them missions, and upgrade the villa's defenses. Managing resources and maintaining the loyalty of your recruits adds a compelling strategic element to the experience, enhancing the sense of immersion and investment in the Brotherhood's cause.

Minor Drawbacks:
While Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood excels in many areas, it's not without its minor drawbacks. Some players may find certain missions or objectives to be repetitive, particularly during the later stages of the game. Additionally, occasional technical issues such as glitches or frame rate drops may detract from the overall experience, though these are relatively minor and infrequent.

Conclusion:
Overall, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a worthy addition to the Assassin's Creed series, offering a compelling blend of story-driven gameplay, open-world exploration, and strategic depth. With its immersive setting and its engaging narrative, it's a must-play for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. Despite a few minor drawbacks, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of the Assassin's Creed series and the creativity of its developers.

Note: I write this as a review of the single-player experience. I am not sure if the multiplayer is even accessible still. However, I do remember playing it when the game launched on PS3 and found it enjoyable for its time.",1688333898,1708102085,True,0,0,0.480769246816635132,0,True,False,False

The gameplay, whilst on **some** corners more polished, feels alot more clunkier and glitchy than 2.

[*]First you'll need an Ubisoft Connect account with the client application downloaded and installed. Ubisoft has yet to figure out that people don't want to jump through these hoops.
[*]Attempt to launch the game through Steam. It should open Ubisoft Connect and if all goes well, you'll have the ""Activate a Key"" window open. This is a good time to swear as loudly as possible because you have no idea what the heck it's talking about. Then again swearing throughout this entire process is both reasonable and highly recommended.
[*]To get the key, right-click the game in the Steam launcher, select manage, and get the ""CD Key"" from there.
[*]Copy and paste the key into the ""Activate a Key"" window. The game should activate through Ubisoft Connect, despite the fact that you purchased the right to play the game through Steam and most Steam games don't require you to do anywhere near this many gymnastics to play them.

With the addition of the crossbow and the poison dart the stealth is much better and easier than in AC2. The combat introduces Chain-Assassinations so most of the time combat is pretty easy, it only gets a bit harder if there are about 10-15 enemies surrounding you which doesnt happen that often. Still, it looks & feels great + it really gices you that feeling of being an unstoppable master assassin. All in All the gameplay is fantastic but to be honest, the story isn't that great (especially compared to AC2). It's definitely not horrible though.

Just like in the Second game you can upgrade a city to make money (Monterrigioni / Rome). To do that, you unfortunately don't really do that much except renovating stores around the map. They hid good Armor & Weapons behind Quests that are really annoying to complete (you have to collect multiple rare items for each one), I wasn't able to finish a single one of those before the end of the game. What I like most about this game is the Brotherhood itself. You can rescue NPC's and recruit them into the Brotherhood. At the start they only get a hidden blade but once you send them on missions the'll gain experience and you can level their Armor and Weaponry up. You can also use your recruits for stealth and combat. Just watch the games CGI Trailer on YouTube, it explains that mecanic really well.

I'd say 15 bucks is way too cheap. If you haven't played this, buy the first two games for 10 bucks each, play them, and THEN get this one.",1706375222,1706375222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Graphics are obviously outdated, but i don't mind.
-Gameplay wise, the game was really well designed however, the camera always locked on target and running from combat was sometimes challenge in an of itself :D But combat was well designed, if you learn to counter, disarm etc.. it becomes very satisfying.
-Side missions, this was hit and miss, DLC missions, Leonardo, past mission, templar and armour missions were fun. Faction missions were less enjoyable imo and assassination contracts were meh. Keep in mind this is my personal opinion.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the sequel to AC 2 is just like its compelling predecessor. Even though I originally planned to play it in 2015, I recently finished the game and achieved a perfect 100% synchronization, including all side quests and collectibles.

The visually immersive graphics still hold up well for its time, delivering a captivating and engaging experience. The gameplay is very good, much like its prequel, finding the right mix between being sneaky and engaging in intense fights. The game's creative design introduces important elements and playstyles that later became standard in the series.

In short, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood has a very good story, level design, and gameplay.

This time around i'll give it a 7/10 (taking the mod i found in account, otherwise it's a pass for me and the removal of achievements which is automatically a negative review).

I played Assassin's Creed Revelations through and finished Assassin's Creed before I came back to this game. Graphics are starting to be tolerable since this game in the series.

Now missions can be completed incorrectly too, but I had a lot more fun doing missions without caring about the correct way to achieve full synchronization. There are unnecessary forced camera movements and target lock is not a lock at all, if you touch your mouse and there are multiple enemies in sight. Some of the climbing sequences were tedious and boring. The blend mechanism has been made useful sometimes and combat has been made more challenging. Once again, the modern-day part of the story and the apple might as well have been dropped entirely.

Brotherhood is the closest game to Grand Theft Auto with horses that I have tried. I like that any horse can be stolen and ridden on it.",1705478047,1705478047,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Released in 2010, this installment builds upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, Assassin's Creed II. Here's a detailed review highlighting the pros and cons of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

Pros:

Compelling Narrative: Brotherhood seamlessly picks up where Assassin's Creed II left off, delivering a rich and immersive storyline. The game's plot is full of twists and turns, exploring Ezio Auditore da Firenze's quest for vengeance and the overarching conflict between the Assassins and the Templars.

Historical Accuracy: As with previous entries in the series, Brotherhood excels in recreating historical settings. The detailed recreation of Rome during the Renaissance period provides players with an authentic experience, immersing them in the art, architecture, and political intrigue of the time.

Expanded Gameplay: Brotherhood introduces the innovative Brotherhood system, allowing players to recruit and train fellow Assassins. This adds a strategic layer to the gameplay, as these recruits can be assigned various missions and provide valuable assistance during intense battles.

Stunning Visuals: The game's visuals are a testament to the capabilities of the Anvil engine. Rome is beautifully rendered, and the attention to detail in character design and animations enhances the overall gaming experience. Climbing the city's iconic structures provides breathtaking panoramic views.

Fluid Combat System: Building upon the success of Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood refines the combat system, offering a more fluid and intuitive experience. The addition of new weapons and the ability to dual-wield further diversifies the combat options, making each encounter feel dynamic.

Multiplayer Innovation: Assassin's Creed Brotherhood stands out as one of the first games in the series to introduce a multiplayer mode. The innovative online component allows players to experience the thrill of the hunt in a unique and competitive environment.

Cons:

Repetitive Mission Structure: While the game boasts a vast and open-world environment, some players may find the mission structure repetitive. The tasks assigned to players, such as liberating territories and assassinating targets, can become formulaic over time.

Occasional Glitches: Like many open-world games, Brotherhood is not without its share of occasional glitches and technical hiccups. While most are minor and do not significantly impact the overall experience, they can be a source of frustration for some players.

Steep Learning Curve for Newcomers: For those unfamiliar with the Assassin's Creed series, Brotherhood may present a steep learning curve due to its complex narrative and intricate gameplay mechanics. While the game attempts to provide context, newcomers might feel somewhat overwhelmed.

In conclusion, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood successfully builds upon the strengths of its predecessor, delivering a captivating narrative, improved gameplay mechanics, and an engaging multiplayer experience. Despite some minor shortcomings, the game remains a standout title in the Assassin's Creed series, offering a satisfying blend of historical exploration and stealthy action.",1704864849,1704864849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played this when it came out and remember thinking the gameplay was pretty good but the story was bad. To sum it up :

The good
- Only one city to explore, so it feels a lot more polished
- Controls feel a bit better than previous games
- Armor does not break as often
- Rome is a pretty nice setting for the game

The bad
- Ezio's story barely progresses, same thing for Desmond's.
- The antagonist is boring. We know nothing about him and are supposed to care?
- Armor breaking system is still present
- Feels like the devs put less attention to detail in this one. In one of the end scenes, the power (conveniently) goes out, but the lights are still on. In another scene, Ezio jokingly says he's from Montreal, which was founded some 140 years after the events of this game (ironic from a studio based in that very city).
- The main story is like 12 hours long. It honestly could've been a DLC.

The ""why?""
- They added the ability to buy stores and invest money (???) just in case you're both a fan of AC and Monopoly, but since the game is so short this really is a useless feature.

And for the worst offence, I'm pretty sure they rushed the ending to this game. After the seventh sequence (out of nine), the story skips to a month later and you have to play through a gimmicky fight. Then it skips another month and you play through another version of the same gimmicky fight. Then it skips three months and it's another version of the same fight. Then it skips like three years and now you're in the middle of a battle between two identical factions (but one's yellow). When you finally fight the main antagonist, you have to play through the same quick-time event (yuck) FOUR TIMES. And it's the exact same scene every time. 

Seriously just skip it. I wanted to play it to make sure I didn't miss anything story-wise but nothing happened. In fact, here's a summary : [spoiler] Rodrigo Borgia dies, Desmond finds the apple, and the dead gods possess him and make him stab Lucy [/spoiler] There, you know everything!",1704606040,1704606040,False,2,1,0.482748746871948242,0,True,False,False

Hell, even graphically, it still looks really nice, especially given how this game was designed for the potatoes that are the Xbox 360 and PS3!

Pros:
- Great story and writing
- Improved gameplay
- More side-activities and content
- Improved K&M controls
- Fantastic soundtrack!
- Rome is a great open-world

A Brotherhood Reborn ✨

Assassin's Creed® Brotherhood picks up where Assassin's Creed® II left off, with Ezio Auditore da Firenze at the helm of a newly revitalized Assassin Brotherhood. Ezio must unite the Order, train new recruits, and wage war against the Templars, who are growing stronger under the leadership of Rodrigo Borgia.

The Brotherhood's Arsenal 🗺️

Assassin's Creed® Brotherhood introduces the concept of the Brotherhood's arsenal, which allows Ezio to recruit and train new assassins to assist him in his missions. These recruits can be sent on missions to gather resources, assassinate targets, and defend Brotherhood strongholds.

Building and Upgrading Strongholds 🏰

Assassin's Creed® Brotherhood features a new mechanic where Ezio can build and upgrade Brotherhood strongholds. These strongholds serve as bases of operations for the Brotherhood, and they can be upgraded to provide new resources and facilities.

A Vast and Diverse World 🌆

Assassin's Creed® Brotherhood expands on the open-world of Assassin's Creed® II, adding new areas to explore and features to discover. Players can travel to Rome, a bustling city full of secrets and challenges, and explore the surrounding countryside.

Overall Impression: A Brotherhood United 🏆

Assassin's Creed® Brotherhood is a superb sequel that builds upon the foundations of Assassin's Creed® II, offering a deeper and more engaging experience. The introduction of the Brotherhood system, the new stronghold mechanic, and the expanded open world make Assassin's Creed® Brotherhood a must-play for fans of the franchise.

Pros:

Brotherhood reborn
Brotherhood's arsenal
Building and upgrading strongholds
Vast and diverse world

Cons:

Fewer new gameplay mechanics
Some repetitive side quests

Set right after the events of Assassin's Creed II you continue the journeys of both Desmond and Ezio Auditore.
In modern day you play as Desmond who after barely escaping from Abstergo, yet again, has to establish a base in Monteriggioni in order to discover where his ancestor, Ezio, hid the Apple of Eden.
Through the Animus you relieve the memories of and play as Ezio Auditore, who after escaping from Rome has to return once more to exact revenge on the Borgia who besieged Monteriggioni.


[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]Good graphics. Massively improved from the previous game.
[*]Good story.
[*]Combat is more fluid than the previous game.
[*]Addition of an assassin recruitment and leveling system which can help you in missions.
[*]Another great soundtrack by Jesper Kyd.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]Poor optimization. Specially noticeable in in-doors missions where the game stutters quite a lot.
[*]The addition of optional objectives in missions. I hate them. They restrict gameplay and some of them are so stupid that you have to play the missions twice so you can complete the optional objective and get all the collectibles.
[*]A few bugs here and there such as having to lock the game at 60fps because some missions might break, like the Flying Machine 2.0.
[*]Still has clunky camera angles which might cause you to fall to your death.
[*]Too many collectibles yet again but at least you can buy maps for the collectibles after collecting a certain amount of flags.
[*]Later glyph puzzles are still quite hard to understand.
[*]No cloud save for some reason.
[*]Ubisoft Connect is trash. Keeps asking me every f*cking time for my password and logging me off from the launcher constantly even though it's a TRUSTED DEVICE! (Can be circumvented by adding ""-playoffline"" to the launch options. It won't change a thing since Ubisoft took down the multiplayer servers, dlc and rewards down, thanks Ubisoft!)
[*]Ubisoft taking away DLCs from the people who bought it even the SINGLEPLAYER ones.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a great game that improves on many aspects of the previous game BUT I cannot recommend this game because of Ubisoft's sh*tbag tactics, they STOLE WHAT I PAID FOR!!! Ubisoft is a scumbag company that will take away whatever you pay for, they didn't even bother including the rewards and the DLC for everyone because that's too much effort for them.
I love this game but F*CK UBISOFT!!!

Full sync on every mission, all achievements, full rank in every guild, every item collected, every shop quest done. I've done everything. So, I can say with full certainty that this is the worst AC game i've every played. Out of AC1, AC2, (both of which i wasn't a fan of), AC3, AC black flag, AC syndicate, AC origins, AC Odyssey, this has been my least favourite. I understand that many disagree, which is fine. This is just my opinion.
My issues are with Ezio and the story itself. Ezio has no flaws, no imperfections. Yes, he's a brat at the start of the game, but that doesn't impact how his character operates in the story. It doesn't put him at any disadvantage whatsoever. Throughout the story, his main development has been getting older, because he's already flawless throughout the game. He makes no mistakes, he is loved by nearly everyone, even random npc's on the street (which puts a plot hole in the fact his last recorded moment was at the start of AC 2), and everything he does, even as a child, is perfect, despite a lack of training. This game does very little to challenge or disrupt Ezio's perfection. Every challenge, no matter how hard, is always done with no casualties or issues. He is gifted, promoted and loved greatly that i'm sure he'd ascend to godhood and the fans wouldn't question it as much as other games. He seriously has the worst character development out of any character i've seen in AC.

The plot is a generic revenge story. The villain is a generic ""i want to take over the world (italy)"" type villain. We're constantly preached about how scary and horrid he is, but we're never shown that. This is the same with Ezio, lots of 'Tell' not 'Show'. The start of the game is the only incentive that gives Ezio a hatred to Cesare. Then it's completely left behind. The main focus is put on Cesare's desire for Italy, completely forgetting about his deeds in the start. It's inconsistent, sloppy, rushed, poor writing. 

The mechanics are fine, nothing special to be honest. At the time i can imagine them to be great, but not by today's standard. I've seen many argue that the Ezio trilogy parkour is the best, most realistic. I don't know why, they seem delusional to me. It's janky, inconsistent and not that fun to be honest. 
There is a lot introduced which is great, but quickly overwhelms the already small size of the game. There is so much to do, but no real reason to do any of it. 

I only liked the caterina missions, which featured Ezio throughout his relationship with Caterina. This was the only time i liked his character, as it showed him making mistakes, not being perfect with every move, and it shows him suffering and adding to his character. Too bad the emotional romance aspects are greatly devalued by the fact that Ezio, during these periods, is constantly flirting and seeking any other breathing woman. 
I did enjoy managing the assassin recruits as well, the only part that didn't fill me with frustration.

In total, i hated this game and im glad it's over. 3/10",1701842141,1703421880,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

Oh boy, the triology is incredible!

Assassin's Creed Revelations
I'll start with this game as it was my favourite of them all. Ezio is much older now. Ubisoft does a really good job here of making the character noticeably wiser and more thoughtful. The game is set in Constantinople. And WOW! The city is awesome! It is - in my opinion - by far the most beautiful city in the triology with all the colours and details, and is even remarkable today. You walk through the city and find it simply beautiful. At the same time, all the missions, like the ones from Brotherhood, e.g. taking towers, are always interwoven with little stories. This makes everything seem more alive and contributes wonderfully to the overall atmosphere. The whole story is wonderfully written and comes to a good end. It is with a heavy heart that you finish the last game of the triology.

Assassin's Creed 2
The story of Ezio begins here. The story and the game world are very lovingly designed. There are some moments in this game that have certainly gone down in gaming history, especially because of the grandiose music. After the first Assassin's Creed, I would never have thought that they could make a good game without Altair as the main character. AC 2 clearly showed me that it's possible!

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
I know I'm bound to be crucified by some because of this. It's not ""worse"" than the others. It takes many points from AC2 and spins them further. And it does it very well! But as the games are getting on in years now, I think people play them mainly for the story. And that's where AC2 and AC Revelations are clearly ahead in my opinion.

I love Ubisoft for this series of games! I would so much like to see a proper remaster or remake of the trilogy. With new graphics or and the new mechanics of the newer AC games.

Don't shy away from the age. These games are absolutely worth playing and have a memorable story that will stay with you for a long time. One of the best in the gaming industry.",1703282115,1703282115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It’s probably not the most enjoyable, but it does represent the series and the experience it set out to give the player. It’s a little depressing that this is the best AC game, not because brotherhood sucks, but because it had so much potential that was never taken advantage of.
The combat is the best in the series, countering to instantly kill. Chaining kill after kill is still one of the most satisfying combat systems in gaming. The game understands this and utilizes it by throwing waves of enemies at you.
The story is great, if a little thematically inconsistent with how it treats revenge, but Ezio’s antics are still fun so who cares. The world is a downgrade from ACII, but is still rich in diversity and landmarks. 
Parkour is also the best in the series, which again is depressing given how flawed it is. Parkour is very stop and go without too many parkour puzzle sections to lessen that sting, but you still need to give it some thought.

The graphics are miles better than ACII's, the controls are slightly tighter, the new mechanics all around (namely the fighting mechanics and city renovation things) make the game a lot more enjoyable, and provides hours of gameplay outside of the main campaign (which is quite a bit shorter in this game)

Locations - Outside the animus 
The game tries to return to the idea of the first game where you have a certain freedom to go out and read emails and talk to the characters Lucy, Shaw and Rebeca. Desmond will also be able to walk around the village of Monteriggioni for a while (where he will be hiding for the duration of the game) in search of certain optional hidden artifacts from Ezio's past. 

Locations - inside the animus
The game will focus solely on the confines of Rome and its infamous corruptive possession. Some areas in particular will be available in certain submissions and in the last sequence of the game. 

Tiberina Island Shelter - inside the animus
At one point in the game Ezio will be taken to the place where the brotherhood of assassins and their respective collectibles will remain. Unlike in the second game, purchases such as paintings and weapons will do nothing to improve the monetary value of the place.
On the island there are paint, sewing, medicine and weapons stores that have special items for Ezio's equipment. These items can only be unlocked by obtaining certain items. They can be found by robbing certain thieves on the run, thieves who tend to appear at night in dominated locations and also in certain missions, the wolves of Romulus and in chests surrounded by Rome and in the submissions of Da Vinci and the temples of Romulus. *Certain items can only be obtained from certain chests in Rome and the temples of Romulus. 

Brotherhood of Assassins - the idealistic revolution of assassins created by Ezio and carried on for millions of years to come, will be given the opportunity to recruit 12 assassins in total and upgrade their rank and skills. Some assassins will only be unlocked once you destroy certain Borgia towers. They will be upgraded in certain separate missions found in the pigeon houses and the shelter on Tiber Island. These missions are endless and it's important to carry them out if you are one hundred percent sure that you will be able to achieve your recognition status. Failure to do so could result in the death of the respective mission killers. There will be a bar in Ezio's top left corner that will allow you to call them at certain vital times to kill or distract guards. The better the rank and skill upgrades, the more life and strength the assassins will have to help you. 

Freedom for Rome - inside the animus
The self-centered and authoritarian Borgia Templar family command the entire siege of Rome. During the time that Ezio was never present, this command left the entire territory plagued by misery and ruin for the population. Maquieval steps in and pushes us to invest in all the areas that have been demolished in order to renovate them and gain real investment for Rome. 
In order for these investments to take place, towers commanded by Borgia soldiers must be destroyed so that the respective territories can be unlocked for purchase. 
With each renovation or purchase of a particular estate taken over by the Borgia, you will increase your money in the deposit bank to withdraw later. 
When the stores are unlocked, you will have the option of investing (depending on the degree of possibility) in them to obtain certain items that are vital for acquiring certain equipment for Ezio in the stores on Tiberina Island. 

Collectibles - inside the animus 
*Feathers - the familiar feathers from the old game, this time reduced to no more than 10 to be found and with the proper money in hand Ezio can get the map from the art store to make them visible to be found;
*Borgia flags - as well as the feathers, there will be a map to buy in the art store to make the 101 flags around Rome visible. Bear in mind that some of the flags will be available in the temples of Romulus and in these areas there will be no map to make them visible; 
*Chests - another marked for the purchase of a map, there are a total of 144 chests around Rome with the appearance of those that are not visible in submissions from Leonardo's machines or the tombs of Romulus but these do not add up to the total collected;
*Glyphs - the famous glyphs also return in the areas of Rome with 16 to be found to unlock a small puzzle until you find the second truth, but they are not visible on the map or for purchase; 
*Keys of Romulus - to unlock the lunar garment of the wolf of Romulus, 6 keys will have to be found in the 6 temples of Romulus, which will be visible on the map as soon as certain renovations are carried out or not;

Submissions and synchronizations - inside the animus - apparently the spin off Discovery started the idea that was carried over to the rest of the games, synchronizations are the optional idea of what Ezio actually accomplished at the time in each mission and which will be marked before carrying out each mission in order to reach 100% of each. Reaching a certain number of synchronizations will unlock certain items that will be available in the menu inventory. 
Some submissions will be unlocked as the story progresses or other submissions are completed.
*Thieves, courtesans and mercenaries - when you reform the territory of the thieves, courtesans and mercenaries, a certain number of submissions will be available for you to complete; 
* Copernicus - the famous astronomer and his ideas have not escaped the gaze of the Templars and it will be up to Ezio to save him in certain available submissions; 
*Christina - the scars of time have taken the marks of Ezio's DNA and in certain places there will be a way to remember them;
*Templar agents - the citizens will be lodged and crying out to be rid of certain Templar individuals; 
* Assassinations - assassination submissions will once again return in the pigeon cages;  
* Templar locations - certain regions can be unlocked by reforming certain locations where Ezio can enter to loot treasure;
* Temples of Romulus - if he wants to acquire the wolf costume, Ezio will have to delve into the dreaded depths of the homes of Romulus to acquire his keys, some of which will only be available after a certain renovation.
*Leonardo's weapons - at a certain point in the game Leonardo da Vinci  implores us to destroy certain weapons of war that he has created for the Templars and which could become cruel weaponry in the wrong hands. 

Guild actions and animus training - inside the animus 
The assassins, mercenaries, courtesans and thieves'guilds will have a blackboard with the option of completing certain Ezio actions to receive a special item at the end. 
The animus training will be available in the pause menu and will be divided into battle, quest and race modes with various mini missions to be completed in the estimated time to receive the appropriate gold, bronze or silver insignia. 

Atmosphere and composition - the dark life of Rome is felt at certain points and riding or climbing near the Colosseum becomes even more captivating. Jesper Kyd again does not fail and Echoes of the Roman in Ruins remains for me as a memory in this remarkable reminder.

Multiplayer - just as the name and marketing suggest, the game that abysmally smoked out the single player ideology of the Assassins Creed saga for a distribution of human ants running around in search of points. 

Conclusion - Assassins Creed Brotherhood tends to be one of the saga's tightrope walkers. Despite reducing the exploration rate of the previous games, its story continues to be marked by the notoriety of the narrative and its atmospheric vividness.

*Note: ubisoft ended up disconnecting certain dlc's from the game that contained very good submissions such as Leonardo's disappearance and even though I had already obtained and played these submissions before in my bookstore, they have been removed.",1702082321,1702135413,True,88,2,0.877635300159454346,0,True,False,False

I slammed my Xbox controller right into my balls because of something and probably got cancelled by my neighbour from all the cursing I did after the fact. The mission was a timed race which took place on rooftops with guards that can knock you off and screw up the whole thing - that along with the not so perfect parkour (sometimes you'll just slide off the edge - not often but it happens - it's just weird, and then sometimes your guy will jump anywhere other than you where you want him to go). Those issues affect the entire game of course, not just the race but I'm just saying, there should be a warning for this game; May cause ball pain.

On a more positive note; the parkour is pretty fluid most of the time.

There's some annoying enemies which can run faster than you and when they attack, you end up almost tripping over which looks dumb and not very, 'yo guys I'm an epic badass assassino'. The guards on horses are also annoying. Combat is a bit scuffed - enemies can attack must faster and can attack you when you're locked into an 'execution' animation. Some enemies you can disarm, some you can't. Some enemies keep blocking until you break their guard. But it just seems that no matter what, they're invulnerable to disarms, being grabbed and so on. The lock on will sometimes go off when you kill an enemy even though there are other enemies and then you don't notice and start swinging your sword into thin air... To knock the guard off his horse, you have to lock on and you'll [i] eventually [/i] enter into a stance which will do the thing but until then it's just silly. You can always just shoot him but sometimes you want to do something else, right? Or maybe I just missed something.

On a more positive note; the combat can be pretty epic when you chain kill enemies and some start running away in fear. Every weapon has different kill animations and everything from just slicing and dicing with the sword, disarming and bludgeoning enemies with their own weapons, impaling them with their own spears, beating them to death with your fists or using your various allies is just so much fun. There's lots of variety there.

One of my most favourite things to do is to poison guards and watch them dance about or kill a guard on a rooftop and throw the body onto the street and watch people look around like, whodunnit? Or knocking/throwing guards or people from rooftops, over edges, into hay piles or into water. Or just beating up random people. There's so much you can do. 

The location (Rome) is fucking awesome and the soundtrack... Chef's kiss. The world building is amazing. It feels alive. You could just roam around the city (by foot or by horse) for hours and feel like you're there. Lots of NPCs walking around, doing stuff along with the ambience and scenery - simply phenomenal. 

There's a ton of missions to do - a good amount of main quests but also a ton of side content. My 30+ hours is from just doing all of that and I haven't even bothered much with the other stuff like collectables. So if you're a completionist, you're looking at plenty more hours. I recommend doing the side stuff at every opportunity since it's all about weakening the enemy through assassination contracts and other assignments - it all ties together nicely. The end battle is pretty epic and even more if you put in the time to [i] liberate [/i] Rome by doing all the good shit the game gives you to do, levelling up your assassin recruits, sending them on missions, etc.

Now there are a few missions which are pure trash and could make or break you (more likely the latter) which involve piloting some shitty Da Vinci contraptions. There's also a lot of time limits in missions and the game encourages you to complete missions [i] their [/i] way - e.g. don't kill any enemies. Annoying but not absolutely necessary unless you're a completionist - doing some will unlock other side content though so you do have to play along a little bit. Still annoying and dumb - just let me play the fucking game! They also like to fail randomly for reasons. There's also certain mission where you're forced to remain undetected or else you fail the mission. 

I had a few random crashes - can't say I fixed them but they occurred while working on the Borgia towers and/or using the assassin signal. There was also one right at the end which almost prevented me from completing the game; 'Shaun, get the van'... Crash. If you experience this, try running the game in compatibility mode for Windows 7. That's what worked for me. There's also a few other recommended things I wrote down and that is capping the FPS to 60 (but that causes gross stutter), adding -playoffline in the game settings on Steam and setting v-sync to on or off in-game (not sure they did anything but worth messing around with if you run into any crashes or other issues).

Lastly, another annoying thing is that sometimes you have to log in to your Ubisoft account to access the game but not every time. It's still annoying though obviously but 'tis life.

I can't comment on the multiplayer at the moment but I'm pretty sure it's dead. RIP.  

There's a few mods you can get. I highly recommend this one; 

https://www.nexusmods.com/assassinscreedbrotherhood/mods/145/

I also recommend using the WeMod trainer if you want some more chill in your game and a bit more fun. Unlimited Health, money, ammo, Assassin Signal and more. It's pretty cool spamming that assassin signal while walking menacingly up the street towards your target/destination! 

Maybe there's a bit of nostalgia involved but yeah, I definitely recommend the game still even though it pissed me off a lot of times. It's a classic and everything from the graphics to the combat holds up well. The soundtrack and world building will certainly carry this one into eternity though - it ages like a fine wine. 😌",1701906721,1701907256,True,1,2,0.5,0,True,False,False

This time you will primarily be visiting ancient Rome, furthering Ezio's struggles against the Borgias. The gameplay remains mostly the same with some additions here and there to spice things up.[/i]

[b]Facts[/b]
[list]
[*] Focused on one city (Rome) instead of multiple locations.
[*] Introduces hired assassins for summoning on the spot.
[*] Further builds on the renovations and factions from 2.
[*] Reintroduces the vigilantes.
[*] More condensed gameplay than part 2.
[/list]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*] Story remains strong and captivating.
[*] Rome is an amazing city.
[*] Side content is expanded, but still enjoyable.
[*] The Borgias are interesting antagonists.
[*] Expands on the Templar Lairs with Romulus Lairs.
[*] The Da Vinci DLC / side content is quite fun.
[/list]
[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*] Still far too easy.
[*] Renovation income with hired assassins is basically god mode.
[*] Side content might already be too much for some.
[*] Parkour still clunky.
[*] Modern day stuff still not interesting.
[*] Introduces optional sync objectives in main missions. Dislike.
[*] Tied to Ubisoft's launcher.

Yes. Although it's basically Assassin's Creed 2b it still retains the good story and gameplay elements from that game. It's more of the same, but the original it derives most of its content from was one of the best in the series.",1701031812,1701036183,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is great for those who can't get enough of AC2. This isn’t simply a game... it’s a piece of art. Everything about it was almost perfect. It felt like a novel that's played instead of read. It effectively built upon all the gameplay mechanics from AC2 and added fun additions.

Starts with Ezio, who is one of the best protagonists in gaming history, at his best. Ezio is at his peak and those f**king robes show it. His relationship with the side characters are a joy to watch. The story was great and tied in well with the modern day story. The villains are great and it has a hell of an opening.

 Cesare is, in my opinion, still the best main antagonist of the entire series. I loved training assassins and calling them to take out people.  Really emphasized the being the leader position the game places you in. Rome is gorgeous and the soundtrack is perfection.

The combat was so much fun and satisfying. Pulling off the crazy kill streaks was always satisfying. The side plot of rebuilding the brotherhood was great. Being able to call in aide from assassins, as well as sending them in missions made you feel like you were actually part of a brotherhood. All of the side missions felt as if they served the main story, so it never felt tedious. Rebuilding Rome gave a nice sense of accomplishment.

While there may be random games in the series that do individual things better than brotherhood, I think it’s the only game that does all aspects (from combat, to stealth, to parkour, to story to setting, etc.) with such finesse. Back then, Ubisoft actually properly built upon an existing concept…

So should you buy anything Ezio related in
2023? It's never too late to fit Ezio's life into yours… Brotherhood along with the other games will always be worth it, even 10 years from now... it's a masterpiece.

[quote=Leonardo Da Vinci]“Our life is built by the deaths of others.”[/quote]

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Today I'm sharing with you my review of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the direct sequel to Assassin's Creed II, with the character Ezio Auditore da Firenze.

[b]This evaluation is quite short due to the fact that between 2 and brotherhood, the changes are minor, it is mainly the continuation of the story.[/b]

[h1] Assassin's Creed Brotherhood [/h1]
[list]
[*]A new episode following [b]Assassin's Creed II[/b], barely a year after the previous one, same universe with the addition of a multiplayer mode. We pick up exactly where the second opus left off. We become a master assassin and we must do the same to the Templars by recruiting new recruits who will be trained to join the Brotherhood of Assassins. This opus takes place in the city of Rome, a fairly large city that we must rebuild, it offers various activities, more or less repetitive.

[*]I will not talk about the story of the game to avoid spoiling future players, however this sequel completes the story of the second game well. In my opinion the ending of the game is a bit disappointing.
[/list]
[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
[list]
[*]Gameplay enriched with new elements and missions. The combat system is much faster and more enjoyable with the possibility of chaining together enemies super quickly without taking damage with a little training. There are various missions, and secondary mission objectives to add a little challenge.
[/list]
[h1] Graphism [/h1]
[list]
[*]A real graphic effort, especially Rome, which is a wealthy city, the graphics engine begins to run out of steam when we look at the engine of recent games, a lot of clipping and frequent slowdown even if the game retains an unmistakable charm and aesthetic
[/list]
[h1] OST [/h1]
[list]
[*]I find some quality musical themes, which perfectly accompanies the original dubbing, the post-sync is often disastrous.
[/list]
[h1] Do I recommend the game to you? [/h1]

We could fear that this episode would be the recycling of an already exploited universe, however Assassin's Creed Brotherhood remains a good sequel to the second episode. Ezio takes on greater responsibility in being master of the assassins and he takes advantage of these new abilities in Rome, which is filled with countless diverse activities.

[b]Note:[/b] Multiplayer mode no longer available, servers are offline. ⚠️

I enjoyed it because, like previous AC games, it feels good to play. Running, climbing, hidden blading people, that is still awesome. Rome was incredibly well done, too. It is the first city in an AC game I've been to IRL, and I was so very impressed. I would see a building and go ""oh of course I'm there so there should be this and that nearby"" and THERE WAS. And all the details could be compared to my own pictures. Really, really impressive. The storyline from the modern part of the game was also very interesting, there were lots of things to do and I loved the characters interactions.

That said. The storyline from the past wasn't just bland, it was uninteresting and meaningless, with cardboard and/or forgettable characters. There were SO. MANY. SIDEQUESTS. ALL THE TIME. It can be well done, but here they barely had relevance, they were such a distraction from the main story that sometimes I forgot what I was supposed to be doing or who were the characters involved. Some parts of the map were arbitrarily blocked depending on story progression, which feels very, very bad in a game known for freedom of movement. And let's not forget the game-breaking bugs. Several, one of them preventing game completion. (Fortunately, playing such an old game means that solutions are all over the internet.) One such bug is in the DLC, making it unplayable, so thanks for nothing.
(And Ezio is still as annoying as in AC II.)

I'd say only play Brotherhood if you're interested in the history of AC games, or want to know what happens in the Ezio trilogy.",1699205291,1699205291,False,1,0,0.458748072385787964,0,True,False,False

Good game, only annoying bits are:
- The flying mission as the controls have no consistency and are unwieldy.

Brotherhood feels like a natural extension to Ezio's story, the mechanics are more or less the same, but you get a few sweet upgrades weapon- and allywise, and it works. With this new arsenal at your disposal it really feels like you're suddenly playing as a master of the Assassin Order.
As for Rome - wonderful. Kinda disappointed that actually buying landmarks doesn't really do much for you in gameplay, but just running around, climbing those... Never knew I wanted to spend so much time atop the aqueducts and the Colosseum, yet here we are.

It's particularly frustrating that even those who have previously purchased the content can no longer access it. While it is understandable for multiplayer servers to get taken down after a while, it is unacceptable to revoke access to singleplayer content already bought by the players. A black spot on Ubisoft's already dirty image. Worst of all, it sets a concerning precedent for other games in the future, causing players to worry about losing access to content they have legitimately acquired.

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a remarkable addition to the series, building on the foundation laid by its predecessor, Assassin's Creed II. While some may view it as an expansion, the game's upgrades and new gameplay elements make it a worthy standalone experience. The story takes a different direction, offering a more mature Ezio who truly embodies the role of an assassin. Personal preferences may vary, but both narratives hold their own charm.

One standout aspect of the game is the progression in Desmond's present-day storyline, which adds depth and excitement to the overall experience.

Gameplay remains consistent with its predecessor, but the improvements are evident. The introduction of assistance from fellow assassins adds an impressive and visually appealing dimension to combat, though it might make battles feel a bit easier. The crossbow also serves as a powerful tool, potentially making stealth and combat too simplistic when combined with the help of assassins.

Parkour and movement mechanics retain the greatness of Assassin's Creed II, allowing players to navigate the beautifully designed environment of Rome with ease.

However, the overwhelming feeling when opening the map is a notable downside. Instead of a gradual progression, players are bombarded with information from the start, which could deter some from immersing themselves fully in the game.

The inclusion of flags is a nostalgic nice touch, but the new feature of buying and upgrading buildings feels somewhat out of place. While it aligns with the storyline and the concept of Ezio restoring Rome, it lacks a clear purpose beyond providing a sense of progression.

The multiplayer component is no longer relevant due to the shutdown of the servers. Additionally, some technical issues with the gamepad inputs prevented a proper evaluation of the multiplayer experience.

For achievement hunters: one substantial disappointment is the lack of Steam achievements despite the game featuring a big list of them (53). It's unfortunate that players who earn these achievements won't be able to showcase them on the Steam platform. They can be seen only in the in-game options menu. I can show my achievements progression only by [url=https://imgur.com/gallery/8pgveXl]screenshots[/url], on [url=https://backloggery.com/games.php?user=ciocolici&search=Assassin%27s+Creed%3A+Brotherhood&console=&status=&unplayed=&rating=&region=&own=0&alpha=1]Backloggery[/url], or written by myself on my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/]Steam profile[/url]. If you choose to do everything there is to be done in the game, you will end up with only a handful of achievements missing, which are not that challenging, in my opinion. But, of course, doing everything that's optional in an Assassin's Creed game is a challenge and time-consuming feat itself. So keep that in mind.

Overall, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a commendable addition to the franchise, offering a great follow-up with improved gameplay and an engaging continuation of Ezio's storyline.",1512868089,1696190138,True,4,0,0.581749081611633301,1,True,False,False

For what I like, earning money is far better in pacing than the last game where you were making dough hand over fist. The assassin call mechanic is fun, and I liked training new guys to get me out of a pinch. I appreciate not having to leave the animus at all once you're in it, and it feels nice to buy up shops and new stuff. Fighting is more nuanced and you no longer have to dodge to win against heavily armored opponents because Ezio has discovered the art of kicking. Overall, it furthers Ezio's story and is still fun when it works, 'when' being the key word.

What I don't like? For starters, many missions are unplayable on anything outside of a 60hz refresh rate, including the very last story mission which is obviously very frustrating. Not only that, but the very first mission is something that you can fail easily over and over again because you are not experienced with the new mechanics and there is a small sliver of time between the win and fail states.

The camera outside of freeroam (which happens almost anytime you play a side mission inside a structure) is terrible. Jumping is, at times, less relative to Ezio and more perspective based, meaning you have to change which direction you're pushing all of a sudden without warning, causing you to lose time and health.

Voice syncing is a problem in most AC games, but lines will often not play at all until someone is done speaking and then is immediately cut off by another character's lines. It's not the most well written game in the world, but I do like hearing what's going on so I'd recommend turning on subs.

A.I. and win conditions seem to act arbitrarily; in essence: it's not consistent. Killing some guards during a ""do not alert guards"" mission is fine, but sometimes killing another guard in the exact same way will desync Desmond and force you to start from the last checkpoint. It's not a fun experience when you're rethinking shooting a bow at someone for fear that you might have to restart a large chunk of a hard level.

Lastly and leastly, signing in to Uplay is terrible. Any company that can't format their games to steam really loses any respect that I have for them.

tl;dr: Play it if it's on sale and only if you want to further Ezio's story, but other than small character details, you really aren't missing much jumping from this game to Revelations.",1695977674,1695977674,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really fun game. Parkour is for the most part really great, and exploring Rome's pretty cool. Combat is fun too, but I can't exactly call it a good system. Basically, if you kill an enemy, you go into this sort of ""kill streak"" mode, which allows you to literally one hit kill everybody around you with zero opposition. Big armored dude? Annihilated. Guy who's supposedly a member of the Pope's elite guard? Dead immediately. And even if you can't kill an enemy (as in, they block every single one of your attacks), you either A: one hit kill them with a counter, B: one hit kill them with a hidden blade counter (also works in the previous two games, because what's game balance?), or C: use a kick move that immediately breaks their guard and allows you to three hit kill them with no resistance. I get you want your protagonist to be strong, and that he has ancient alien blood in him or whatever, but making every single enemy a complete pushover doesn't exactly make for a good system. You barely have to try. Literally the only people who change things up are the horse guys (who you one hit kill with your gun), and the final boss who can't be one hit killed. Also, you only get the one city here, Rome (It does work for the whole ""revolution"" plot they're trying to tell, tho). Some missions take you to other cities briefly, but they aren't free roam locations, and you don't really explore them: you just do your quest, and then unless you replay the mission, you never go back. 

This entry's new addition is the ""assassin recruits"", basically your own personal army in a way. You find someone getting attacked, save them, then you can have them fight guards for you while you go do an objective or whatever. Personally I never really used them much, but you can unlock an arrow storm ability that kills basically everyone instantly so you don't have to bother with stealth, so that's pretty neato. You upgrade them by sending them on missions across the world and to other cities, gameplay wise all you do is click on some options and if they're strong enough, they come back with more xp to level themselves up. Riveting gameplay.

Story wise, it's pretty cool to simulate retaking Rome from the Borgia family, and there's some great characters here, but I think the main villain, Cesare, was pretty crap. You see him like 3 times before the finale of the game, and all he really does is go back to Rome, talk to his family, and then immediately leave to go campaigning.  Yes, I know the historical Cesare did in fact spend a lot of time going around killing cities, but my question is, why not just have Rodrigo be the villain again instead of someone who's barely even in the same area code as you half the time? From what I've read, the pope was super supportive of his son's rampage across the country, and repeatedly robbed his cardinals and straight up dismissed their wills in order to fund war campaigns. Yet here, he's all ""don't conquer Italy, I didn't agree to this, you're stupid and ruining everything!"" I know you can have different interpretations and all, but if you're gonna go for historical accuracy, maybe try to make them a little bit accurate to their real life selves? Personally would've been way more satisfying to assassinate the pope, and then see how the Borgia's power completely evaporates with his loss rather than have him die because his son's a crybaby. (Also, Juan Borgia did not fund Cesare, he was actually the initial commander of the Papal forces until he got offed mysteriously (And yes, I know there were two Juans in universe, and the ""Younger"" is the actual historical one. There was no Juan ""the Elder"". Still inaccurate). Praise Ubi for removing the crossbow from AC1 all you like, won't change the fact that they were never really good at historical accuracy.)

I know I'm being pretty negative, but I did genuinely have a great time here. Running around stabbing guys, while way too easy in my opinion, is really fun, and a lot of the missions were really great. The assassin recruits were also pretty neat, even if I never really used them much in my playthrough, and building up your organization's strength while simultaneously tearing down the Borgia's whole entire grasp on the city is super cool. Ezio was still a wonderful protagonist, and while I think the villains were a bit of a letdown, there's some great characters here throughout. If you like AC or want a casual action game to play through, definitely pick this up.

I have fond memories playing it back in my Xbox days, running around rebuilding Rome and playing in the weirdly engaging multiplayer that was introduced. This is also the first game that had controller support on steam. Anyway, I finished the second game and so moved on to the next in the series. 

Brotherhood is a direct sequel to AC2, picking up directly where the last one ended in the vault under Rome. Rodrigo Borgia, the leader of the Templars you left alive at the end of the last game, is now Pope and is largely concerned with the burden of rule and it’s Cesare, his son, who is royally fucking over the city for personal gain. Seeking to destroy the Assassins, he lays siege to Monteriggioni, destroying the city and forcing it’s populace to flee, whereupon Ezio travels to Rome to finish what he started.

Meanwhile, Desmond and gang are searching for answers to the revelation at the end of the last game, that there was a civilization that existed before humans that were wiped out by a solar flare and that the earth is about due to experience that disaster again. There’s a bit more reason to leave the animus this time too as they’ve set up shop in the vault below modern Monteriggioni and Desmond can get out and explore the town a bit, along with the occasional free-running section.

An effort has been made to streamline combat a little. Now when you impale someone on your sword, your next attack will guarantee a kill, so chaining together an unbroken kill combo is child’s play and you can easily slice your way through throngs of enemies. The health pips above their head will now also flash when they’re about to attack making countering killing them a lot easier. This does, of course, break the games difficulty over your knee but the combat in the last two games was so obnoxious I have to count it as a positive.

Rather than the three or four self-contained cities to explore, there’s just one big, sprawling map of Rome and its surroundings, and I like this as it removes those tedious level transitions when moving between sandboxes and makes it feel more like one big cohesive world. There are Templar strongholds that can be captured by killing their commander and burning down their imposing towers. Doing so allows you to buy the shops in that region which gives you something else to spend all that money on while also increasing your hourly income.

Missions now have an optional objective to complete which range from insultingly easy to wall-head-buttingly infuriating. I like this because it usually involves using a piece of equipment or game feature I would otherwise have just let rot and it makes the levels replayable if you’re shooting for 100% completion.
One particular feature I love is the ability to form your own Assassin’s Bureau, recruiting desperate vigilantes off the streets and enrolling them in your 10-step murder program. They can be sent off on off-screen missions around the world, levelling them up and bringing you back rewards, or you can set them on guards as a distraction or just for laughs. I remember being weirdly engaged with my little family I built the first time round. Once they hit max level, you can assign them to guard any Templar strongholds you’ve converted to your cause.

Thought I’d take a peek at the multiplayer too to see if it still runs. Surprisingly, the servers are still operating and there’re people still playing it. I’d have expected something like this to be dead by now but it was less than ten seconds before I was loaded into a lobby. First thing to note was my controller settings were fucked. I had to rebind everything and I couldn’t use my triggers for some reason.

The multiplayer is essentially one big game of hide and seek. It’s a very good way of incorporating the Assassin’s Creed gameplay into a multiplayer setting. You choose a character and the map is then filled with clones of yours and other characters. You have to blend in with the population and use hiding spots to go undiscovered long enough to assassinate your target (another player), deducting which clone is the real one while other players are doing the same to you, gaining more points if you do it stealthily or with a florish. It’s chaotic and hectic and possibly not what you want if you’re coming back after a long absence from it. I’d recommend the team games for new players as they’re much more straight forward. You’re either hiding or seeking, not having to do both at the same time, which I found for a much more enjoyable experience. There is a little bit of a balance issue regarding high-tier perks but it’s a pioneering multiplayer style so there’s bound to be teething troubles.

Brotherhood was where Assassin’s Creed found its stride and could possibly be blamed for the masses that were churned out after it, but I enjoyed playing and there were plenty of things to like about it. The story was going through the motions a bit but the sandbox made up for it I feel. So it’s a thumbs up from me.",1693779530,1693779530,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★☆

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood continues the gripping narrative of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, picking up right where its predecessor left off and delivering an engaging and seamless evolution of the franchise. Released in 2010, the game builds upon the foundation of Assassin's Creed 2 and introduces exciting new gameplay elements, making it a worthy addition to the Assassin's Creed series.

The storyline in Brotherhood is a compelling continuation of Ezio's journey as he travels to Rome to confront the Templars and establish a Brotherhood of Assassins. The narrative explores themes of leadership, loyalty, and sacrifice, further developing Ezio's character while introducing new allies and formidable enemies. The addition of a modern-day narrative thread featuring Desmond Miles adds depth and connectivity to the overarching plot.

The city of Rome serves as a sprawling open-world playground, filled with activities, side missions, and secrets to discover. The sense of freedom and exploration is further enhanced by the ability to recruit and train fellow Assassins, creating a sense of camaraderie and empowerment. The strategic gameplay element of sending recruited Assassins on missions around the world adds a new layer of complexity and depth to the experience.

The core gameplay mechanics remain solid, with Ezio's parkour abilities and fluid combat system refined from the previous installment. The addition of the ""Brotherhood"" mechanic, allowing players to call upon their recruited Assassins for assistance during missions, makes for thrilling and dynamic gameplay moments. Witnessing a coordinated attack by your Brotherhood against unsuspecting enemies adds a satisfying sense of power and mastery.

Brotherhood retains the stunning visual design and attention to historical detail seen in Assassin's Creed 2, with the city of Rome beautifully realized and brought to life. The architecture, landmarks, and bustling streets create an immersive experience that captures the essence of Renaissance-era Italy.

The game's presentation is complemented by a captivating soundtrack that sets the tone for the story and gameplay. The evocative music enhances the emotional impact of key moments, creating an unforgettable gaming experience.

Despite its strengths, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood can feel like more of an expansion than a completely standalone title, as it closely follows the formula of its predecessor. Additionally, some players may find certain side missions or activities to be slightly repetitive over time.

In conclusion, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood delivers a satisfying and immersive continuation of Ezio Auditore's story while introducing innovative gameplay mechanics that enrich the Assassin's Creed experience. The bond forged with Ezio and his Brotherhood of Assassins, coupled with the impressive setting of Renaissance Rome, makes this installment a standout entry in the series.

If you're a fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise or historical action-adventure games, Brotherhood is a must-play. Its seamless combination of narrative depth, refined gameplay, and a compelling open-world will keep you hooked on the journey through the shadows of history.",1691351161,1691489068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is awesome and it’s really good for the time that it came out. Ezio is the best assassin from the entire franchise and he really stands out from all the others. The gameplay is very fun and simple and the graphics are ok. The story was very nice and entertaining but I want to say the pros and cons.
Pros: The villain is the best from the entire franchise and I don’t know why they don’t write anymore so evil and interesting characters in the other games. In addition the story is very easy and understandable to follow.
Cons: I felt that the characters and Ezio dont have so much chemistry like the previous one, maybe because is the second from the trilogy. Also I thought that the main story will be longer, I don’t know why but I think that they could do much more with the villain and the main character relationship in order the story to be longer and more emotional. 

Overall its very good game and if you like assassins creed it’s a must. Moreover I played it on my steam deck and it runs fantastic, I don’t know why it’s not verified.

Developed by Ubisoft, this third installment in the Assassin's Creed series takes everything you loved about the previous games and elevates it to a whole new level, like climbing the Colosseum in a single bound. So, don your stylish assassin's robes, synchronize your viewpoints, and let's dive into the captivating world of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

Continuation of Ezio's Journey:
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood picks up right where Assassin's Creed II left off, following the journey of the charismatic Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Our charming Italian assassin is on a mission to restore peace to Rome and liberate its citizens from the iron grip of the corrupt Templars.

Ezio's growth as a character is as impressive as his stealthy assassinations. He's like that friend who always has a witty comeback, and you can't help but admire his charm and determination.

Build Your Brotherhood:
One of the most exciting features of Brotherhood is the ability to recruit and train your own band of assassins. It's like Ezio decided to start his own exclusive club for stealthy killers. You'll feel like a proud mentor as you send your assassins on daring missions across Europe, like a strategic game of chess.

Building a brotherhood of skilled assassins is as fulfilling as unlocking the secrets of a hidden codex. Plus, having a team of deadly allies at your disposal makes you feel as unstoppable as an eagle soaring through the sky.

Rome, the Eternal City:
In Brotherhood, you'll explore the grandeur of Renaissance Rome, where every street corner holds a hidden treasure or a secret to uncover. The historical city is meticulously recreated, like a beautifully crafted time machine.

The city's bustling streets, towering landmarks, and hidden catacombs make Rome a captivating playground for your stealthy escapades. Whether you're leaping across rooftops or blending into a bustling crowd, the city's vibrant atmosphere envelops you like a warm Italian embrace.

Strategic Conquest:
One of the most engaging aspects of Brotherhood is the strategic conquest of Rome. As you liberate districts from the Templars' grip, you'll witness the city come alive with newfound energy, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

Managing the economic, political, and cultural aspects of the city feels like you're Ezio's personal advisor, guiding the fate of Rome with a deft hand. It's a rewarding experience that's as satisfying as solving a challenging puzzle.

Multiplayer Mayhem:
Ah, the multiplayer – a thrilling addition to the Assassin's Creed series that's as unexpected as a hidden blade from behind. In Brotherhood, you'll put your assassin skills to the test in tense and exhilarating multiplayer matches.

Stalking your targets, blending into crowds, and performing a perfectly timed assassination is like being a master of disguise. The multiplayer mayhem adds a layer of depth to the game that's as exciting as a secret society meeting.

A Well-Crafted Tale:
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood offers a gripping narrative that weaves the present-day struggles of Desmond Miles with the historical journey of Ezio. The seamless blend of the past and present is like an intricate tapestry that draws you deeper into the conspiracy.

The story is filled with shocking twists and turns, like a rollercoaster ride of emotions. You'll feel as invested in the modern-day conflict as you are in Ezio's mission, making the game a truly immersive experience.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a worthy continuation of Ezio's epic journey, offering a thrilling blend of historical exploration, strategic gameplay, and engaging storytelling. Leading your own brotherhood of assassins is as satisfying as unlocking the secrets of an ancient artifact.

So, if you're ready to embrace the life of an assassin, explore the grandeur of Renaissance Rome, and build your own brotherhood of deadly allies, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is waiting to take you on a memorable adventure. Remember, in the world of assassins and Templar conspiracies, you'll find a story that's as captivating as a Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece.",1690309920,1690309920,True,5,0,0.578947365283966064,0,True,False,False

The mechanic that Ezio is able to recruit new assassin's and use these in fights was a welcome experience. I feel that the game is significantly better than Assassin's Creed 1, such that the mechanics are alright, and the graphics are fine (definitely for the time it was released). This game had the feel of an AC game as I had experienced it before, but with some baby flaws. 

If you would like to jump into Assassin's Creed from the very start, this game would provide a fine beginning.

After having played Odyssey and Valhalla, I wanted to jump into the story line of the Assassin's Creed universe for a while now. Even though my friends advised against playing AC 1 and 2, I stubbornly started playing AC 1, without success. This game however proved a great kick-start into a chronological playthrough of most AC games (hopefully).

It was not as good as my friend promised it to be, but I think that might be because gaming experiences are better when games have been played at a young age. Still absolutely a recommendation for anyone trying to replay or start playing the assassin's creed franchise in current times.

Overall a great game and a great experience.",1690072763,1690073878,True,1,0,0.506134986877441406,0,True,False,False

And then it asked me for an activation key. And I didn't buy an activation key on Steam or Ubisoft, I bought the game via the Steam application, not via some key. So there is no key.
I de-installed the game, re-installed the game, and tried again. I de-installed Ubisoft and tried again. I de-installed the game and re-installed the game, and tried again. I re-installed Ubisoft, and tried again.
Nothing works. Either I want my money back, or I want Steam to fix this. Other AC games work on Steam, or work via Ubisoft. This is the only game that asks for a key. The only one.

After actually playing, I have noticed some disturbing things:
Quality. This game has the same quality as Prince of Persia 3D. It looks as late 90's/early 2000's, and when it comes to the controls, they have made some horrifying decisions. The way Ezio climbs a wall, the way he runs. W is forward, Shift is run. Space is climb and go over objects, and you only use one button for Eagle view. But this game has thrown everything out the window. And you cannot adapt all keys, especially the ones you want.
Gameplay. Ruined by how you run and climb, and ones you have to man the cannon for real, you cannot win. I already lost most of my time and life on climbing a wall that could only be climbed at the ladder, because when in an inferno/siege, you cannot climb the wall itself. Meanwhile, my Ezio, or whatever the young fellows name is, keeps climbing, and pushing back so he basically jumps off the wall, into the inferno or the edge of where you are suppose to be, into the white sheet that keeps you from going back.
Once you are on the wall, most of the defense on the wall is already broken, and even if you can move the cannon left and right quickly, you still are not able to aim quick enough to destroy all cannons. And unlike with Red Dead Redemption, you cannot skip to the end of the story sequence, because this is Assassin's pooping Creed!

This is the worst game I have ever played, because it looks 20 years old, and doesn't let you set controls to the buttons you want to set them to, because there is only a small set of buttons you can change. And you are forced to shoot cannons until your defenses are broken, and you can do it all over again.",1689252607,1689427496,False,4,0,0.560000002384185791,1,True,False,False

Story wise it's a fantastic addition to Ezio's story, the modern day story suffers it's first misstep seemingly stemming from ""Kristen Bell wanted more royalties"" and as a response Ubisoft decided to rewrite the story to deal with that.

As for the game itself, I’d consider Brotherhood to be a further improvement to the Assassin’s Creed franchise, even though the improvement gap is smaller than between the first and second games. It adds just enough new systems to make it enjoyable, though it does feel more like an expansion pack to AC2 than an entirely new game.

The main changes compared to its predecessor are the new techniques in combat, assassin recruits, optional mission requirements, and the (now defunct) multiplayer. Yes, the first two systems do make the game much, much easier than the last, though it’s not much of a loss considering how the combat before can get repetitive. In the end, it feels like it streamlines things a bit. As for optional mission requirements, they do add some replayability, though they also further limit the freedom of tackling missions that the previous games had, while sometimes also being frustrating.

If you liked AC2, you’re probably going to like Brotherhood. While it plays more like an expansion pack to AC2 than a full-blown sequel, its improvements and refinements make it an easy recommendation nonetheless.",1624926907,1687342373,True,2,0,0.534161508083343506,0,True,False,False

AC: Brotherhood was that one innovation we get once in a while that had everything we've ever wanted. The stealth mechanics were natural, refined to its best. Your arsenal was wide, with guns, poison blade, etc. Your armor selection also comes with a wide variety. And one the best factors in the game is how you, an assassin, becomes a millionaire by renovating banks and shops all across Italy. 

The story of Ezio and Desmond gets fleshed out even more in the game. Each character was memorable, not dull like before. Even after finishing the game, I still wondered if there was more to the story, to Ezio of this time. Sure there is AC: Revelation, but it was not what I expected. 

It is a 10/10 for me. From the amount of missions, world exploration to the story telling, AC: B did a fantastic job. It is a must buy if you truly want to experience the Assassins' Creed franchise.",1686556989,1686556989,True,6,1,0.593488752841949463,0,True,False,False

I'd still say that's pretty accurate, but that's not a bad thing at all! The gameplay, combat, parkour, and story all still feel fun to play through, and Rome is a fun city to explore with lots of fun quests to go on. However, I definitely have a few gripes. The first is pretty minor, that being that there are ""shop quests"" requiring you to bring specific items to a shopkeeper to unlock a new item, the problem being that these items generate randomly, making them damn hard to find. I played the 60ish hours and did 100% completion and still didn't even get close to completing most of these quests. My second gripe is the bugs. Overall, the game isn't too buggy, but there are a handful of genuinely gamebreaking bugs that make missions completely unplayable unless you change your settings (cutscenes won't trigger or your controls won't work). Lastly but definitely not least, the 100% synchronization requirements for some missions are just plain cruel. In particular, any mission that requires you not take damage as a bonus requirement is pure evil and awful design. For god's sake, some of leonardo's invention missions, which are otherwise very fun missions, require you to play through about 10 minutes of gameplay to get to the last segment, where if you take damage you have to restart the ENTIRE mission and play through the same areas over and over until you finally manage to successfully complete it. If you could restart a particular section, it would cut down on so much time and frustration. Alas, it's still a fun game and I would recommend it, just maybe don't be a completionist like me.",1685659039,1685659039,True,9,0,0.62795943021774292,0,True,False,False

I was planning on rating it higher but the ending really brought it down a notch. So after replaying now the first 3 AC games (1, 2 and this), Brotherhood is definitely the best out of the bunch. The graphics seemed to get a major upgrade from the first 2, and actually looks somewhat alright now. Still doesn't fully hold up anymore but 1 and 2 were just hard to look at currently. The gameplay is also at its best, felt the most fluid out of all of them so far and had a solid mix of the stealth gameplay along with the more action packed stuff. 

They also do a great job of moving the ""real"" world story forward which I always appreciate. Overall it's a great game and a worth addition to the series as a whole. So why not higher? Well the whole game ran smoothly for the most part, no real issues whatsoever and everything seemed good...until the end. The ending of the game has some absolutely game breaking issues. One where you actually can't proceed to the ending (relatively easy fix, either turn on vsync or drop the framrate down to 60fps, but even if it's easy this still shouldn't happen), and there were also portions where my character would literally blink in and out of existence during a climbing portion, or T pose, or would just become invisible entirely (while the framerate was dropping well below 60). I'm not sure what the deal is with the end and why it's so poorly optimized/so many bugs there and nowhere else but it definitely put a damper on an otherwise great experience

Beyond that, the game mostly takes place in Rome, the city is built with a lot of love and feels awesome, but the world definitely feels a bit more confined because it is only in one place. Cant really say that's a good or a bad thing, I think that'll be more down to personal preference.

Overall 100% worthy entry into the AC series and it's a definite recommend if you've liked 1 and 2. Sadly the bugs toward the end really left a poor taste though",1684675352,1684675352,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As far as the story comes , its definitely short , like i think its only about ezio around 5 years but ac 2 had ezio with 20 years approx span of his life. Ac 2 has better story ngl, but the rest i give to brotherhood. The killing animations and variety of weapons and the multikill is too gud if perfected.

One of my major problems was the parcour. It is great but sometimes too clumsy, like in the first game. Sometimes it works perfectly and sometimes you will jump to the left while aiming your camera right.

But my biggest problem was the characters. The actions of the heroes in particular. The ideology presented in the first games is put into hard practice here and there can be no denial that it is fanatical spread of chaos through terrorism. Hiding behind the mask of ""fighting for the people"" you work with thieves, steal people's money yourself, beat up or kill many innocent because they are in your way, sometimes using them as a distraction or living shield. In the previous games this was somewhat hidden behind conspiracies and character drama. Here it is clearly visible. What's more, since Ezio is not constantly meeting new people anymore and he is interacting with his family and friends more, his true character becomes more apparent. It turns out he is a cheeky and also a rude brute with no remorse.

The dialogues are weak to the point of being ridiculous sometimes. Every time a character is about to express a strong emotion, they instead spat expository information. So the characters come out either as shallow or robotic. To the point that the villains, who are as evil as a comic book super-villain can get, feel more human than the heroes.

Yet the gameplay is still good enough, the world looks amazing and even the story has it's moments. The villains for example.",1556217192,1683489435,True,6,2,0.522485136985778809,0,True,False,False

Summary:
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is an action-adventure video game that was released in 2010, developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the third game in the main Assassin's Creed series and is a direct sequel to Assassin's Creed II.

The game follows the story of Desmond Miles, a modern-day descendant of a long line of Assassins. In the game, Desmond uses the Animus, a device that allows him to relive the memories of his ancestors. In this case, he relives the memories of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an Italian nobleman and master assassin who lived during the Renaissance period.

The game takes place in Rome, Italy, and follows Ezio as he works to rebuild the Assassin Brotherhood and take down the Borgia family, a powerful and corrupt family that has taken control of the city. Along the way, Ezio allies himself with other historical figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Caterina Sforza.

The gameplay features a mix of free-running, stealth, and combat. Players can explore the open-world environment of Rome, climb buildings, and use various tools and weapons to assassinate targets. The game also introduces a new multiplayer mode, where players can take on the role of various characters and compete against each other in various game modes.

Overall, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a highly acclaimed game that builds on the strengths of its predecessor and adds new features and gameplay mechanics. It is praised for its open-world design, engaging story, and varied gameplay.

I do still love Brotherhood, the settings, and some over all improvements. It's fun, satisfying, but i just don't think it quite stands up to the last game for me. It's by no means bad, but a lot of the game feels wasted.

[h1]Story[/h1]
[list]
   [*]Desmond, really had my interest in this one, but the story itself doesn't really move much, the focus is on Ezio outside of some enjoyable moments.
   [*]Ezio starts off directly from the previous game. The whole intro is a phenomenal experience, and really pulls you back in after the previous title.
   [*]The story isn't as strong as AC2, it's still good but there was no real sense of urgency and it felt rushed in a lot of areas. 
   [*]The main villain is a cartoon character, and a lot of the side characters are just far less interesting then what we had in the last game, Except for Leonardo of course.
[/list]
[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
[b]Movement[/b]
[list]
    [*]Parkour is pretty much the same as the previous game.
    [*]You can ride horses pretty much everywhere and whistle for them, which is a nice, especially because of the more open portions of the map. 
    [*]Vehicles make a return, and i'd still rather completely avoid them.
[/list]
[b]Combat[/b] 
[list]
    [*]Open combat again, is pretty similar to the last while feeling more refined.
    [*]Executions are just straight up a joy to watch, they don't take up much time either.
    [*]You have the option of calling in recruits to help you during a fight, or calling in arrow storm to just wipe out everyone in the area, and it's so damn awesome to witness.
[/list]
[b]Stealth[/b]
[list]
    [*]Works the same as the last game, really not much to say about it.
[/list]
[b]Questing/side content[/b]
[list]
    [*]Good variety in missions, along with the option of the full synchronization challenges for missions. Which will have you doing a bit extra to get that 100%
    [*]Romulus dens have to be my favourite missions in the game, following the crypts we got in the last game. They are grander and have you on a treasure hunt, with a nice reward at the end. 
   [*]You get to actually run around as Desmond a bit in the modern day. While it's a small part it's still pretty fun, being able to use the skills he's learnt from Ezio.
   [*]Being able to rebuild your villa is in it's upgraded from, with the task of renovating Rome. If you invest some time into it, by mid game you should be rolling in money. 
   [*]Assassin recruitment system, has you saving random citizens that will then join the brotherhood. Each recruit all have there own level and gear that can be upgraded the more experience they earn. Which they earn by either, sending them off on missions or calling them into combat.
   [*]Feathers make a return, thankfully there is only 10 of them, as well as glyphs. Borgia flags are your big one being  101 of them on the map, which some are missable through missions. You can also complete your collection of weapon and armour, which i find to be much more enjoyable.
[/list]
[b]Difficulty[/b] 
[list]
    [*]While not particularly hard, the game has it's moments when you can be overwhelmed, but it provides all the tools you need.
[/list]
[b]Length[/b] 
[list]
    [*]It takes 20 or so hours to complete everything in the game, the story, a lot less if you just rush it.
[/list]

[h1]Visuals, Audio, and Performance.[/h1] 
[b]Visuals[/b]
[list]
    [*]Looking very similar to the previous game, which makes sense considering the time frame in releases. It does however have small improvements over the faces, shadows, clothing and armour having finer details, especially on main characters.
    [*]Rome while being a fantastic setting just looked boring and dull for me most of the time, especially by the end of the game. It just seems to lack any flavour, and is easily forgettable aside from the major landmarks.
    [*]Render distance is still painfully short and can make some npc's look terrifying or hilarious before coming into view.
[/list]
[b]Audio[/b]
[list]
    [*]Voice acting per usual is solid and really brings the characters to life.
    [*]The soundtrack just didn't hit for me like it did in the last game even with the hard similarity, aside from a few notable pieces that popped up through the game, for the most part it wasn't boring but it was overused and repetitive. Still very enjoyable. 
[/list]
[b]Performance and Bugs.[/b]
[list]
    [*]If you can run the last, you will mostly likely be fine with this one.
    [*] Some major stuttering or low fps can be fixed by setting the game to 60hz and turning vsync on, which is odd.

There are also gameplay improvements, such as additional side missions. What I like is that full synchronization, i.e., 100%, is much easier because the DLCs are not buggy like in Assassin's Creed 2. The protagonist is excellent, and we might even say  that he is in his best(in terms of battle iq along mobility/agility) and strongest form he ever was. The only potential gripe I have is with the ""Da Vinci War Machine"" quest line, as they were clunky af and poorly optimized. but other than that, it's an excellent game that I recommend.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood continua ( de maneira mediocre ) a história de Ezio Auditore da Firenze após os acontecimentos de Assassin's Creed II. Ezio, acompanhado de seu tio Mario, deixam a cidade de Roma após a luta com Rodrigo Borgia rumo a Monteriggioni. Porém, agora terão que lidar com o resto da família Borgia que são igualmente, se não pior que o próprio Espanhol ( César, Lucrezia & Cia ).Nesse título vivencíamos a trajetoria de Ezio na cidade de Roma ( agora bem mais ampla que a breve apresentação no título anterior ) que está sobre o domínio da família Borgia. César é um vilão bem meia boca parecendo mais um bebê chorão inconsequente do que um grandioso mestre templário de verdade, bem broxante...

Sinceramente, o enredo de jogo por parte do Ezio é completamente jogado e não parece ser bem desenvolvido. O jogo claramente tem a cara de UMA GRANDE DLC do que um jogo de verdade. Ezio parece ( após anos sendo um assassino ) perdido em meio aos acontecimentos e é constantemente questionado pelos próprios integrantes do Credo. O que realmente salva em relação ao enredo é o desenvolvimento da trama de Desmond Miles em busca do artefato. Até mesmo a luta final é tão medíocre e decepcionante que chega a dar sono, muito ruinzinha...Ezio também está incrívelmente mais chato e rabugento nesse título, sendo um babaca até com a própria irmã...tipo? As missões são OK, para quem jogou o título anterior não há muito com o que sem impressionar com esse, com um destaque para as missões de tumbas e as Máquinas de Guerra de Leonardo da Vinci ( tirando aquela NOJEIRA da missão Máquina Voadora 2.0 QUE É UM LIXO GIGANTESCO, MAU DESENVOLVIDA E COM MECÂNICA E CONTROLES NOJENTOS DE TÃO RUINS, é um pavor voar naquela coisa, e o 100% de sync..boa sorte. Pois haja a santa paciência ). Também continuamos a descobrir um pouco mais do mistério sobre o que aconteceu com o Subject 16 ( desvendando os enigmas espalhados pelo mapa, no mesmo esquema que o jogo anterior ) com direito até um trecho jogável legalzinho ( é recomendado finalizar antes da campanha principal para um melhor fluxo na história ). Vemos também uns trechos do passado de Ezio com seu interesse romântico Cristina durante os acontecimentos do jogo anterior, em formato de flashback.

O jogo contava com multiplayer ( um dos fatores de maior elogio para as notas de jogo ), PORÉM COMO A UBISOFT É UMA EMPRESA FALIDA, DESLIGARAM OS SERVIDORES DO MULTIPLAYER E DAS DLC's. Sem contar que a missão da DLC do Leonardo Da Vinci é COMPLETAMENTE BUGADA ( nem joguei de desgosto, e não tem fix para consertar esse problema, então fdc ).

E FDC VOCÊ QUE PAGOU PELAS DLCS - ATT, UBISOFT <3

Alguns adicionais na jogabilidade merecem destaque também. Durante a missões temos os obejtivos opcionais a serem completados para o 100% de sync. Como no título anterior temos um sistema de economia no qual podemos investir/reformar os estabelecimentos na cidade para garantirmos uma renda recorrente  ao decorrer do tempo, como também, reformar monumentos históricos da cidade como o próprio Coliseu e, pontos de fast travel ( que você AINDA VAI PRECISAR IR ATÉ UM DELES NO MAPA PARA USAR ). O lado ruim disso é que agora temos que FAZER O DOBRO para termos praticamente o mesmo montante de renda que tínhamos no jogo anterior, então o jogo em si, não é maior, só tem mais encheção de linguiça. Agora temos as Torres Borgia, as quais temos que matar o capitão responsável antes que ele fuja para termos a possibilidade de reformar a cidade e seus estabelicimentos. Podemos recrutar integrantes para Irmandade ( uma bela adição para a jogabilidade, porém deixa o combate do jogo 53435432 mais fácil e não muito desafiador ), realizando missões espalhadas pelo mapa, enviá-los em missões em diferentes cidades ( gerando level para upar o nível de assassino dos mesmos ). Algum idiota teve A BRILHANTE IDÉIA de colocar uma PORCARIA de um sistema de treino do Animus no qual podemos tirar três tipos de medalhas: bronze, prata e ouro ( não conta para o 100% de sync ), cara completamente patético e desnecessário, TERRÍVEL para quem gosta de completar tudo. Acho que foi a mesma pessoa que criou aquelas porcarias de desafios de facções, os quais você tem que fazer diversos mini objetivos de gameplay para completar (  nem lembro se ganhamos alguma coisa depois de completar, de tão chatos que são ).

Em suma, vários aspectos do jogo são apenas um CTRL C + CTRL V ( temos uma missão de levar um báu enquanto disfarçado de guarda que é MUITO CARA DE PAU, copiada do Assassin's Creed II, 0 esforço criativo ) do sucesso do jogo anterior ( com algumas pontuais adições na mecânica interessantes, de fato ) aliado a uma GIGANTESCA ENROLAÇÃO no lado da história do Ezio e a trama só fica realmente interessante quando desvendamos mais mistérios e reviravoltas na jornada de seu descente Desmond Miles. Na minha opinião, só vale a compra para aqueles interessados REALMENTE na franquia de Assassin's Creed.",1682735528,1682735528,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You barely get any background for them or why they're a part of their order, whether it be for power or ideology. Most of the targets you kill just because they have connections to the Borgia. The only meaningful bad guy in this game is Cesare, who, up until the very end, you only see trying to fuck Rodrigo Borgia's daughter. Ezio basically doesn't like him just because he's a Templar (they don't say how or why), and because he killed Uncle Mario. So yea, kinda underwhelming cast of villains.

Moving on, one thing that upset me when I was young, and still upsets me to this day is the fact that the entire game takes place in Rome. There are 2 other areas, but you can only visit both once during the story, then never again because they get shut off. Unlike Assassin's Creed 1 or 2, you can't go to different areas with different environments and enemies. And this game takes place over the course of 8 years, too. 

What redeems this game, though, is the mechanics. Rebuilding Rome and rebuilding the brotherhood. Creating a monopoly on every single shop to earn thousands every 20 minutes. Then, you don't even have to kill half the guards you fight because of arrow storm by calling your assassin's. It's kinda badass.

Not to mention the combat, but it's honestly way too easy. In all these old AC games you could counter a majority of enemies, but in this game particularly onward, you can chain your executions and take out many enemies in 1 shot. Plus, you can kick harder enemies.

Ezio's story himself in this series didn't held my attention too much but the story's overall is well-executed. The story still continues in Italy's greatest city, Rome. Many places that player can explore, especially The Colosseum. This time, some things changed, including building management & side missions.

Building management in this game is about renovate the city of Rome. In order to renovate the buildings, player needs to destroy enemy's tower. FYI, tips to earn money more faster is by renovate the buildings. The side mission isn't that interesting for me, such as finding Scrolls of Romulus & destroying war machines. Also, sometimes I had issues countering an enemy while fighting.

Brotherhood also contain Glyphs inside the game, same like AC2. But the difference is there are few puzzles that they added & if there's a red eye icon by certain places on the database, it means there's a glyph around there.

New feature that I liked from the Brotherhood is player can recruit an assassin by saving the citizen from the enemy. Then, player can call assassins for help or do a contract mission to them. When an assassin reaches the maximum level, player can do a ceremony scene that promotes the assassin to a real assassin, just like Ezio joined the Assassin in AC2.[hr][/hr]Assassin's Creed

It's so big you need to fast travel through sewers and by horseback, otherwise the game would probably take 100 hours to complete.

There's a lot of good changes to the AC formula, and a few annoying ones (like changing some of the controls on Xbox controller, requiring you to re-calibrate your muscle memory for 5-10 hours of gameplay before you stop accidentally murdering innocents). 

The main story is again the strong point, with very little fluff content, even compared to AC2. Combat is vastly improved, along with the ability to cheese big fights by calling on your assassins to wipe out everyone in sight. 

Framerate isn't locked to 60FPS like AC2 was, but running at higher framerates will make Brotherhood stuttery due to its age and graphic API. If you're playing with a controller, just lock FPS to 60 and its fine.

Overall AC Brotherhood is the best yet in the franchise, and takes just as long to complete as AC2, making it more than just an expansion. The Ezio story and the people involved are more fleshed out, especially your enemies who really embrace their insanity and lust for power. The writers don't hold back in this one.

The reintroduction of characters, locations and mechanics didn't feel forced at all, and every sequence fit perfectly into the story. The beginning of this game is a direct continuation from the last scene in AC II. Shops aren't provided to you from the beginning. You take down Borgia Towers as you renovate art merchant, blacksmith, doctor and tailor shops, tunnel entrances, and purchase landmarks. Every mission, every renovation, and every assassination is a step towards a common goal; to take back Rome. 

I appreciate this game letting us explore Rome and the Vatican as we didn't get much of a chance to in the previous game. You can now ride horses through Rome, as well as steal other peoples' horses. 

Rome in AC:Brotherhood, much alike AC I, is more hostile in comparison to the cities in AC II. The fitting soundtrack reflects this with its intense and chilling background music. As beautiful as Rome is, it is the only city you can explore in this game. This felt like a slight downgrade from the multiple uniquely gorgeous cities in AC II. 

Combat, missions, and gameplay as a whole were refined. Dialogue is brilliant both in Renaissance Italy and in the present. The back and forth banter between Desmond, Lucy, Rebecca and Shaun felt very natural. So did Ezio and Claudia's quarrel. Cutscenes were more intense.[spoiler]You get to explore Monteriggioni and the Colosseum as both Ezio and Desmond.[/spoiler]The introduction of the brotherhood, and the ability to recruit saved citizens to become assassins, filled the hole that made saving citizens in the first AC game boring. 

Every Lair of Romulus is unique and requires a different skill to clear. The Da Vinci Disappearance was also fun to play through. Overall, good additions. 

We see characters develop. Ezio becomes more mentally and emotionally mature.[spoiler]We finally get to see Claudia inducted into the Assassin Order.[/spoiler]Even Rodrigo looks like he's being more cautious, more aware, and in comparison to Cesare, his character development is much clearer.[spoiler]The Cristina missions show a romance that could never truly blossom and its impact on Ezio as a character.[/spoiler]While he is the cool superhero figure that is the protagonist of this game, he's also a human, one that has been through a lot. All of the traumatic events Ezio experienced shaped him into what he is today, and this game makes sure we're reminded of that fact. 

Just when you think you're done with this game, there's more. This game lets you set your own goals, which I really like. Even after you've completed the story, you can collect flags, feathers, armour, weapons, and paintings as well as finish the Cristina missions, destroy Leonardo's machines, clear the Lairs of Romulus and rebuild Rome. This game is filled with content and fits into its compact setting of Rome. Compact, but not overcrowded. 

Loved this game just as much as AC II.

It was released in 2010 and continues the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, who is now the leader of the Brotherhood of Assassins.

The game takes place in Renaissance-era Rome, and the player takes on the role of Ezio, who must rebuild the Brotherhood and fight against the powerful Borgia family, who have taken control of the city. The game's story is engaging and well-written, with a mix of historical events and fictional elements that create an immersive experience.

One of the standout features of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the ability to recruit and train other Assassins, who can then be sent on missions to gain experience and improve their skills. This adds a layer of strategy to the game, as players must carefully manage their resources and decide which Assassins to send on which missions.

The gameplay mechanics of the game are similar to previous Assassin's Creed games, with a mix of stealth, parkour, and combat. However, the combat system has been improved, with more options and moves available to the player, making it more satisfying and engaging.

The game's open-world design is impressive, with a detailed and historically accurate recreation of Rome. The city is filled with side missions and activities, such as races and courier missions, which provide additional content and rewards for the player.

Overall, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a highly enjoyable and engaging game that improves upon the mechanics of the previous games in the series. With its engaging storyline, well-designed gameplay, and immersive open-world, it's a must-play for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike.",1679894255,1679894255,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

This game feels like waste your time simulator. The combat is fine but that is literally all you do! Everything else is just following and climbing towers. The climbing is fun but it feels so much less important than in the first game. And when you do climb its almost always super telegraphed where to go. The reason it was so fun in the original was because it was a puzzle you had to solve, but here it is just a garden path. The most baffling thing to me about these games is there is literally no stealth system. There are crowds you are supposed to hide in but the only time you need to hide is when you are in a restricted area and there are often no people there!!! Other than that there is literally no way to hide from guards in some missions and the levels are typically designed so wide open that you don't even have any cover to hide behind. The only way to complete missions without being detected is to just kill everyone with a throwing knife. I have always heard that the story in the Ezio trilogy was great and the main reason to play these games. And when it actually gets to the fucking point it is pretty good. Nothing remarkable but entertaining. The issue is its buried under so much nonsense and busywork that when the story does come I am so tired of the bullshit It is hard to care anymore.

Recruit system was a great addition but sending them on quests and leveling them was meaningless since they're OP from the start. The biggest problem about this game IMO are the endless sequences of tailing/escort/chase/follow missions paired with platformer styled missions with pre-determined routes which restrict the player's choice and feel cheap AF. Despite all its flaws, Brotherhood is a great game considering it came out in 2010, and most of its features became the standard for the future AC releases (At least until Unity).

The addition of assassins that you could use to take down enemies from afar was a game-changer and added a whole new level of strategy to the gameplay.

While the storyline and characters were still strong, I found myself wishing for more variety in the missions. The gameplay started to feel repetitive after a while, with too many missions involving tailing or eavesdropping. Additionally, the open-world of Rome didn't feel as alive and immersive as I would have liked, with less interactive elements compared to the previous installment, Assassin's Creed II.

However, the game made up for these shortcomings with its fantastic combat system, which was greatly improved from the previous game. The ability to chain together kills and use the environment to your advantage made for some truly satisfying gameplay moments. The graphics and sound design were also top-notch, bringing the city of Rome to life with stunning detail and atmospheric music.

Overall, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood was a great addition to the series, building upon the strengths of its predecessors while introducing new gameplay elements. While there were some flaws, the addition of the assassin recruits made up for it, and I would highly recommend it to fans of the franchise or anyone looking for an immersive open-world action game.

0) close the game if it is running
1) Go in your game save folder (it should be C:\Users\""user""\Saved Games\Assassin's creed brotherhood)\SAVES, once you open the SAVES you will see the file ""OPTIONS"" and click on it to delete it, or if you want, cut it and paste it somewhere else as backup, which is completely unnecessary, so just delete it, no need for it
2) download the Collector's friend of mine OPTIONS file from this link: https://mega.nz/file/IgUxHBqC#8uycDrD_91_41m9pTmVEBIYYninBoEVsjSokPxm6ovk:%20(https://mega.nz/file/IgUxHBqC#8uycDrD_91_41m9pTmVEBIYYninBoEVsjSokPxm6ovk)
3) put the downloaded OPTIONS file in the folder of the old one before
4) start the game and enjoy, but before:
*Disclaimer* Delete all of your save files inside the game from the scratch and start the new game with new save file (name), you will get all pre-order skins, all Deluxe and Collector's content and every single DLC since 2012, but sadly you cannot invest and go in multiplayer, like I said, Ubisoft has shut the servers forever down. Even when you Link Ubisoft Connection account, multiplayer will be gone forever no matter what, but you will still have all single player dlc, campaigns and skins. Enjoy game Assassins.

TOP 3 FUN THINGS TO DO:
⭐️Climbing buildings.
⭐️Assassinating enemies.
⭐️Calling Assassins to your aid.

THE UNIQUES:
💎Beautiful map layout of Rome.
💎In depth character designs.

PLAYER GAMING REQUIREMENTS:
💼Rome.
💼Parkour.
💼Action.

VERDICT:
This title is certainly a step up to the previous AC, even though this game feels like a huge DLC to Assassins Creed II. I still feel satisfied with the purchase I made, considering this game is only £12.50 which is a bargain for what the game gives you. If you're a die hard AC fan and playing for memories/story then this is a must pick up game to add to your collection, following Ezio and Desmond in their in depth story.
Total Score = 95/100.

Assassins Creed franchise.

GAMEPLAY:
It is the third major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and a direct sequel to 2009's Assassin's Creed II. The plot follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire the same but through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The main story takes place immediately after the plot of Assassin's Creed II, featuring Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in 16th century Italy and his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family.

Continuing my revisiting of the Assassin's Creed franchise, here comes AC: Brotherhood! Having previously played this game on the PS3 when it launched back in 2010, I can say it was a fun revisit! Gameplay speaking, this Assassin's Creed ""2.5"" adds more mechanics for playability, you can recruit assassins to join the Assassins' cause.

Brotherhood continues the trilogy story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze and now focus solely on Rome. The city is big, really big to explore. Although, even if it is quite big, I much preferred the different locations in AC2 than ""only being in Rome"". There is a tons of collectibles in this game... too many for my taste. 101 Borgia Flags does unlock you the Borgia Cape, which sets the notoriety permanently at none. Same effects occurs if you completely rebuild Rome with renovations, you unlock the Auditore Cape. I had the Auditore Cape on my PlayStation 3 playthrough and it was satisfactory to go on a rampage without being chased by guards all the time. But you're more than likely to unlock that cape quite late in the game which makes it almost pointless.


[h1]POSITIVES:[/h1]
[b]+Strong narrative, both in the present with Desmond Miles and in the Animus, Ezio Auditore da Firenze.
+Graphically improved compared to AC2 albeit contains visual glitches at times.
+Soundtrack is excellent and again, composed by Jesper Kyd.
+Same as AC2, the voice acting is solid.
+Improved combat system.
+More weapons and you can now carry heavy weapons.
+Recruiting and using assassins on targets.
+Multiplayer ain't my forté in the AC franchise, but it is very original nonetheless.
+Ability to replay missions.
+High replay value.[/b]


[h1]NEGATIVES:[/h1]
[b]-Uplay DRM.
-Horrendous WASD keyboard + mouse scheme. Play this game with a gamepad! (I played Brotherhood with the Xbox One controller and it worked without any issues).
-AC: Brotherhood feels like a big filler and not a proper sequel or expansion.
-Silly timer on pretty much every assassination missions. Very irritating!
-Some stupid requirements during missions like to not be seen or it causes desynchronisation.
-Draw distance in this game seems broken at times, especially when you see guards appearing right in front of you, i.e.
-Rome pretty much looks like the same anywhere you go in Italy.
-Steep learning curve for the Multiplayer mode.
-The cliffhanger ending is very irritating.
-Too many collectibles... however, once seen in Eagle Vision, it sticks on your map for later acquisition.
-Annoying ""Full synchronisation"" on missions / side-missions that don't do anything except unlock Trophies (PS3) or Achievements.[/b]


[h1]OVERALL:[/h1]
[b]Brotherhood ain't perfect for sure. But if you loved previous AC games, you'll enjoy this game very much. If you're a newcomer in the AC franchise, you could love this game a lot as well but you're gonna feel lost in the story. My best advice, you better play the previous games or at least, get informed by reading / watching wikia and videos online or you're gonna feel completely off the track!

This game adds a few great mechanics which is always welcomed. Although, I felt this game to be more of a filler than a sequel / expansion. It is a good filler that is well paced... right until the very end scene which leaves you in a cliffhanger![/b]


[h1]RECOMMENDATION:[/h1]
[b]Yes, I highly recommend this game for anyone loving this playstyle. The story is very interesting and you feel quite engaged with it as much as the past and the future events. My favorite AC game so far is still AC2 but Brotherhood continues on the same premise so you won't feel lost when playing it.[/b]

The parkour is dumbed down. The combat is dumbed down. Controlling the cannons in the beginning is dumb. Ezio is made dumb by not killing the last guy of 2 and then giving the Apple to the Uncle. Used to could press Feet to Enter (SpaceBar, right there!), but now have to break fluid motion and reach across to press Enter to Enter.

They fixed AC1 with AC2, then broke AC2 with Brotherhood.

After 16 more hours of play time, would I like to revise my review? Yes. Game is more than dumb. It's special. The wolf man psynch challenges, any timed or undetected challenges, dumb. The auto-resheathing of the sword, dumb (also did it in 2, but I thought the devs would've learned it's dumb by their 3rd game).

Great concept, terrible end product... so far.

The gameplay was essentially identical to AC 2, which was kind of disappointing. There were a lot of improvements, but there were only a couple new features (namely the crossbow [which was a welcome addition], the ability to recruit and summon assassins, and the INCREDIBLY fun Leonardo's War Machines). Rome was lovely to explore, but it was too similar to AC 2's landscape/vibe to feel like a separate game, as it wasn't fresh enough. Just my opinion.

The story/characters were, however, very refreshing. Machiavelli and Leonardo were my favorites, of course, but seeing Claudia mature alongside Ezio was also quite lovely. Wasn't really a fan of Cristina's story, as I'm never a fan of courting when in wedlock, but that was really the only story bit that bothered me.

- the end of the main story felt almost a little sudden and rushed? I'm used to AC games giving some clear warning that you're about to go into the final mission, but didn't see that here
- I love going for extra goals and stuff, but some of the full sync requirements felt kind of opposed to still giving enough leeway to make your playthrough your own. In particular, the Romulus missions that required you to finish in a time limit; I like exploring and had to choose between exploring as much as I like, or trying to rush through to finish in the time limit (and for at least a couple of those, the time limit is a stretch to hit, especially if you get screwed over by the parkour)

Everyone was excited that you are able to recruit, train, and summon assassins to kill for you from afar or assist you in battle. Indeed, this was the best improvement to the game and I think made it a lot more fun. Alas, afaik this is still the only AC game where such a system exists and, sadly, is the first high point of the series. (edit: this system exists in AC3 but it's terrible)

I would write more about this game but it's literally just AC2 taking place in one large city that mostly looks the same instead of 3-4 medium-sized ones that are each unique. Well, that and the aforementioned Brotherhood which is the namesake.

In general I like the game, both gameplay and story. I love I after all these years I can replay the game in 4k@120hz. The graphics looks really nice, even slightly better than in AC2. I'm quite sure the main story is shorter than in AC2.

 The assassinations and climbing is somehow worse than in AC2 were I think they nailed it. There's so many times in this games I accidentally/error jump of walls or bunny jump in the streets which I didn't have a problem with in AC2. I can't pinpoint how/why this is. The city is built with wider streets to accommodate traveling around with horse, making the traversal of jumping from building to building worse. The building layout was more fun in in AC2. The horse isn't even very fast, just faster. The teleportation tunnels is a nice addition, but having it being a list instead of pressing up/down/right/left on the map was a mistake. It's tedious to go through the list. The sound dissapears sometimes if I alt+tab out of the game.

I liked upgrading my city in AC2. The buy-every-shop separately gimmick in ACB is a horrendously boring grind next to it, even tough it on paper seems very similar. 

I wouldn't spend any time buying all the places, collect the flags or doing any of the mercenary-, brothel-, assassin-, Templar agent, or thief guild quests. The prizes for the quests are next to useless. A couple of the brothel-quests is a bit fun tough story wise. The upgrading assassins just felt like work, and wasn't any fun except for the first time one rank to assassin and they get initiated into the order. Going to manage the assassins every 20min makes the boring stuff even worse. I would recommend the Brutus/Rommulus quest even though they hint to an interesting backstory which we don't get to see anything of except through light exposition without any deeper discussion around it.

Taking down the Borgia towers was fun after sequence 5ish (after Leonardo makes you upgrades) when I had more life, medicine and bolt space. I would wait to do any side-hustle grinds until then. Some of the captains had an annoying habit of running away or not dying until everyone around was killed. It seems as I could circumvent the no-dying part by assassinating them, but I had to go inn twice so I first could learn were they are.

Upgrading the capacity for crossbow bolt and medicine is clutch. Leonardos glove which let you jump up walls almost never came to use as the game isn't designed around it. It would have been nice if all the towers had a extra route/shortcut you could take by using the glove. The double hidden blade is nice when it comes to use but the game doesn't seem to be designed for it in the same way as in AC2 and didn't feel like the nice upgrade in comparison (which i find boing). When fighting you can chain together kills by pressing x/square a single time and wait for the animation to finish and it'l kill the next person in line. If you mash anymore buttons it won't chain it. Think Batman games. The game explains it ones in the corner of the screen and sadly doesn't force you to learn or use it. Using smoke bombs and then assassinating the nearby enemies is a nice trick. Grabing enemies with lower health let's you kill them immediately and let you go through a lot of enemies super fast.

To finish sequence 9 and encounter Chesare Borgia one last time I turned V-sync on, resolution to 1080 in the game and through nvidia control panel and TV, before turning the game on and off. I'm not sure if it would have been enough with V-sync and then turn on and off. Before I did the last checkpoint just dissapeared and the cut-scene wouldn't start.",1672928301,1672939688,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, the way that the game was design in order to unlock all missions is extremely waste of time for players. The graphic of the game is great even though it is a 10 years old game. The world design is really good, with historical places to visit and enjoy around. The story continues to the story from ACII with the main character now fully in Rome. There is some improvement on control compare to ACII, but the camera lock and clunky non respond button input for a game that required precision is still very horrible. The extra requirement for each mission (e.g, lose no health, time limit, specified weapon kill only) + the clunky control + bad lock camera = Disaster. The game itself will only from 10-15 hrs to finished everything but you will keep seeing yourself going back the memory sequence of the game in order to get 100% sync for each memory sequence. If you can't get at least 75% of the DNA sync at  the end, then you will miss out some cutscene and contents that I think necessary for some players who just want to enjoy the game story. It feels like a DLC for ACII but Ubisoft make the game longer by design it this way. Now I understand why players back in 2012-2015 era hated the yearly Assassin Creed so much. The rush in design and lackluster of gameplay hurt the franchise. If you are a busy adult with work. I would not recommend this game for you, Cost me nearly 32 hours of hair pulling to get all the contents.

I always heard good things about it but I thought it was [i]really[/i] mediocre.

Just one big map instead of multiple like in AC2, what means you always see the same 2 colors throughout the entire game.

Gameplay additions are pretty good. At least the one they added. 
Summoning assassins is a fun mechanic and is also very useful.
That's about it already I think.

Navigating menus is still sluggish and even fast travel doesn't feel ""fast"" because you have to press B on a small little thingy on the map, [i]then[/i] wait through an animation, [i]then[/i] select your destination in a poorly designed UI, [i]then[/i] sit through a loading screen and [i]then[/i] you are at your destination.
Just annoying, used the fast travel about 5 times in my playthrough.
The other option is by horse. I don't like the horse.

It feels good to finally be able to fix this review. For a long time I have had to give it a negative rating because it just didn't work... not because the game was broken, but because Ubisoft weren't issuing keys.

Well, that's now fixed, so I can once again head to Rome at the end of the 1400's and relive this game... and what a game it is.

I can't recommend this enough. The AC story is brilliant, and Ezio's part in that tale is the best. AC4 might have a better engine, and tooling around pirating for the lulz is great, but Ezio is the hero we needed.

The story is surprisingly deep, and Ezio's growth is truly well done. What was teased in AC2 is realised in AC:B (and perfected in AC:Revelations).

Ezio becomes an adult, cleaning up and putting aside the messy parts of his early life and growing into the mentor the Assassins have needed for so long, and paving the way for him to finally complete his task in Revelations.

This is the series' Empire Strikes Back. It's not perfect, but what is? There are cheesy parts, and jokes that miss, but thee is so much fun to be had. There is easily 40 hours of good quality content here. There are climbing puzzles, underground labyrinths to explore, races to run, and a pile of challenges to pursue. Or you can just run around Rome causing mayhem.

Give yourself the best Christmas present you can get and buy the Ezio Trilogy and binge it this holiday season. You get to see Ezio's tragic start, triumphant middle and happy end. If you can only do two, skip AC2: while the story is amazing the engine is very dated and combat flows the least well and offers the least challenge.

I can understand of course that they kept things mainly in Rome because there was a lot that they put into it, yet somehow i'd still kinda wished to have traveled to the other cities like in assassins creed II, but you gotta be happy with what you get.

if they were to add this brotherhood system to Assassins Creed mirage i think it would honestly improve the game to quite some extent.

They added real, 3 dimensional female characters, and allowed you to experience tons of cool side-plots with the different factions and people, and it was really immersive and refreshing, despite being made with the same main characters as in the previous game!
That said. This was also one of the most frustrating assassins creed games I've played so far, because of a few things. First there's the unending collectibles that you just can't get to unless you replay every damn memory at least once. First to 100% it, then to get the collectibles you had to leave behind because you were trying to get through an entire 'dungeon' in 8 minutes. There were so many flags and feathers and treasure boxes, and no real need for the feathers anymore but i guess it was just a callback?
Then there's the occasional glitching where stuff just doesn't show up where it's supposed to or the character jumps the exact opposite direction they're meant to. I had to redo things so many times because the game Took Control of my Camera and then had me jumping sideways off cliffs because it wouldn't register the direction I was pointing the character. I spent ages mashing the shift button because ezio just CLUNG to everything while I was trying to run from guards and then wouldn't LET Go and DROP.
Then there's the fact that 100%, or at least getting to 75% total synch actually AFfects your Plot. You have to reach 75% in order to unlock all the memories of catrina and get some pretty important insight into Ezio's character and past.
But. That means. You have to reach full synch. A LOT. Which brings me to my biggest overarching problem with the mechanics of this game.
Checkpoints that mean nothing.
In order to full synch you get the extra objectives, but if you fail one of those objectives, then go back to your last checkpoint because you died or because you want to try again, the objective is STILL FAILED. You have to start the ENTIRE MEMORY OVER AGAIN. All the cutscenes, all the unskippable animations, all the characters rambling, all the RUNning Across the ENTIRE CITY to get to your target before it even starts. Following someone for five minutes over rooftops is fine the first time. Even the second time. The fifth time, because a guard keeps glitching and won't let your target continue along their walking path? The tenth time because you can't get through a specific section midway into the memory without getting detected?
It's enough to bring you to tears. I gave up the moment I knew I would hit 75%, and just stopped trying to bother with the full synch at all. I've got 52 hours in this game, and I'm not willing to spend another 52 trying to complete it.

Actually, with that in mind. Another frustation was the absolute lack of warning that I had reached the point of no return. I was in the middle of finishing up assassins missions when i started a memory and abruptly realized I couldn't return to rome to finish what I'd been working on. I couldn't get the last of subject 16's puzzles or complete the faction challenges or buy the last landmark i needed in the whole map. I was at 89% synch.
And then when the game finished, I STILL couldn't go back, it just kept resetting the last memory with desmond and I coudn't access my DNA to replay any others.
I was so disappointed that I didn't get any warning, and that in order to try and 100% i would have to start from SCratch.

ANyway. I do highly recommend this game for the extensive plot and lore concepts, and its integral part in the storyline of the assassins creed games. Just don't be too hard on yourself if you can't 100% the memories, and make sure you finish as MUCH of the game as you can while you go, and don't do any memories that involve leaving rome until you're sure you've gotten all the collectibles/achievements you wanted.",1671826338,1671826338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2]Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Review[/h2]

Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is an open-world brawler with stealth mechanics. It’s a sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2 and was released by Ubisoft in 2010. For the old school fanatics of the AC games it’s considered one of if not the best game from the classic format. This game improves quite a bit on some mechanics from the previous one.

For those who have played and liked AC 2, and don’t want to read the rest of this review, it is safe to say that you will love AC Brotherhood. For the rest of you: AC Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio and Desmond right after the ending of AC 2 so I highly advise you to go back and play that game, because the characters and the story of both games are closely connected.


[h1] Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it: [/h1]

[list]
[*][b]What is it exactly that you do in the game?[/b]

You are a skilled assassin that hunts down Templars in order to liberate early 1500’s Rome from their iron fist. Like all AC games you parkour, steal, extort, eavesdrop and spy your way to victory in a huge map with a lot of side activities.

[*][b] Will it make my eyes bleed?[/b]

It's a little bit rough. For a 2010 game it’s “fine”, not great or bad, just “fine”. Early 2010’s Ubisoft games suffer from characters with weird uncanny eyes. The buildings look way too blocky for my liking but the environment overall still looks great. The only graphical thing that I really dislike about this game is how bad the draw distance is. It was ok for their time, but it’s too distracting for today standards. Overall it's a little bit dated, but again, it’s just “fine”.

[*][b]Does it have a good story?[/b]

As for the modern times plot: is complicated... if you are experiencing this franchise for the first time you will find this part of the game interesting, even great! But once you start recontextualizing the events that happen during this game with the “new” lore, you will be depressed.

As for the early 1500’s plot; it’s fine. Ezio is charming as ever, the support characters are fine and every antagonist but Cesare Borgia is bland or criminally underused. What happens in the story of the game is interesting, but it has a lot of filler, especially in early game.

[*][b]Does it have a good soundtrack?[/b]

Yes, Jesper Kyd's score for the AC games is always great, it gets you in the mood and enhances the gameplay. This game has my favorite OST of all the old AC games.

[*][b]Does it have replay value?[/b]

Not much, there are challenges and some secrets, but the plot and the gameplay is always the same.

[*][b]Does it run well?[/b]

Yes, it has some minor bugs and glitches, but nothing game breaking. My only complaint is that I had several issues with the uplay servers. I’m not sure if it’s because the AC brotherhood servers are down or I have a weird issue with my PC, but the mini-game of investing in stores is server dependent and I could not find a way to make it work. Why is this important? Because it helps with the grind to unlock better equipment.

[*][b]Is it fun?[/b]

Yes, but you have to be ok with the jankiness: the parkour is janky, the combat system is janky and the stealth is janky.
[/list]


[h1] So what is Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood?[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood continues the story of both Desmond Miles and Ezio Auditore in a parallel world where there is a secret war of Templars against assassins. There isn’t much to say about what little Desmond does without spoiling you. For the most part you play as Ezio who fights against the Templars in Rome during the 15th century, in order to liberate them and put a stop to the plans of global domination of Cesare Borgia.

Like most Ubisoft open world games, you are the most skilled badass that ever lived and who is as poor as a church mouse. But fortunately, you know the only 2 skills that can get you all the way to the top of the food chain: How to climb tall towers (to unlock parts of the map) and the lack of a moral compass. So you steal and loot everything that is not nailed to the floor, including but not limited to take money from poor.

AC Brotherhood was a huge step forward for the franchise, Ubisoft improved on almost everything from AC2. I particularly want to highlight how much they improved the combat system. You still have to attack, parry and counter enemies, but now everything feels more fluid and brutal. The kill animations are amazingly satisfactory to watch, let me share [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFJDDJgyekw] this video [/url] to you to make my point more clear. The combat system is so fun! Besides this, they improved the parkour and they added more ways to kill your enemies without getting your hands dirty. This was the first time the AC games made you feel like the leader of the Assassins, thanks to the Brotherhood mechanic, which lets you recruit and invoke assassins.

The thing that I like the most about AC games is that you can virtually travel to places and times that were relevant for human history, and that you meet all kinds of interesting, and sometimes eccentric, historical figures, like Leonardo DaVinci. AC brotherhood from that point is a game worth playing, the actual story about the Borgas, specifically Rodrigo and Cesare Borgia is terrifying and interesting.

One more thing before we move to the next part of this review. Since it’s an old game, the multiplayer and online features are mostly dead, because the servers went down a while ago. Be mindful of it in case you want to pick up this game for that. I personally think that the main attraction of the AC is the single-player aspect, but to each their own.

If you encounter the same problems as I did, I suggest you find a guide to loot the chests around the world, so as to complete the quests for certain items. Trust me, a guide will save you a few headaches.


[h1] Things that I like about this game:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Exploring is fun but it can get repetitive. The treasure chests are rewarding, but they are not interesting at all.

[*]The setting is amazing! Roma during the reign of the Pope Alexander VI, is a kickass premise.

[*]The map is huge and full of activities.

[*]The combat system is really fun.

[*]The OST is brilliant.

[*]Some of the endgame activities are fun and unique.

[h1] Things that I dislike about this game:[/h1]

[list]
[*]What you do is not that interesting (not to be confused with “why you do it”). Following NPCs that are slower than you is never fun.

[*]In this game every single loading screen is a white screen. Even though I was prepared with my sunglasses, knowing that the AC games are infamous for spamming white loading screens, I still found them annoying.

[/list]


[h1] Is this game worth my hard earned money?[/h1]

AC brotherhood is fun, it feels dated, especially with how bad the draw distance is, and how the mission structure is presented to the player. But it’s still an interesting but simple game with a fun story that newcomers will surely enjoy. If you are interested in playing what a lot of AC fans call “the best AC ever”, buy it for cheap.

Rating: 7/10

Rather than evolving the formula like AC2 did, Brotherhood refines many existing gameplay elements and adds brand new systems; the most notable one being the ability to recruit citizens and turn them into assassins that fight for the cause. Also, another great addition are the new 100% sync requirements that provide a much needed increase in challenge.

Ezio's character continues to develop; he is now portrayed as a much more experienced and mature individual. He has become a powerful and unstoppable assassin who is ready to put an end to the Borgias, and the game does a great job at setting this final stage. The modern day side of the story is handled really well, too. Desmond and the crew do not detract from the experience at all.

PROS:
- combat is decent

CONS:
- terrible controls
- terrible camera
- uninteresting story
- only one location: Rome

Decent Combat, uninteresting story compared to Guard Slaughter Simulator 2 as well as only Rome as a location.

The music and atmosphere is nice though.

Unfortunately the game has terrible and I mean TERRIBLE controls. Want to jump there? No, you didn't. Want to kill your target? No, kill this civilian instead. Thanks, I hate it. 
This happens so much that it stops you enjoying the game where it really shines. Add some dumb 100% sync challenges to the game on top of the TERRIBLE controls and you have a recipe for complete frustration.

In addition to that the camera likes to take control away from you, missing your jumps and dying.

Guard Slaughter Simulator has never been a particularly good stealth game (actually pretty bad tbh) so it makes sense that they leaned into the combat in modern releases.

Despite all this, when everything works it's actually quite fun which is the only reason I recommend it.",1670348148,1670354934,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

Randomly getting desynced all the time too. And at no point in any of this do I learn anything more about the aforementioned betrayal, neither does the plot fit into the game so far, so I'm beginning to think that these are two missions I should not have access to yet, glitched into one.

When comparing the previous game with this one, there were many welcomed and memorable additions worth mentioning such as: 


Recruiting Citizens to Broaden Your Brotherhood - Besides helping you in combat, you also have the option to upgrade their equipment, and provide them combat experience. With enough time, you will be able to unlock a ceremony for each assassin as they become master assassins. 

New Tools to Play With - The crossbow was a nice addition to provide the players alternative ways to take down their enemies, though it also enabled some missions to be ""cheesed"" by sniping away enemies from long range without any real consequences besides the finite ammo pool. 

Plentiful of fun side-activities - A return to AC2's catacombs wasn't enough for Ubisoft with this instalment, as it's full of side content that vary from reclaiming parts of the fallen city by taking down Borgia Towers to Ezio controlling a fcking tank. You will always have something to do in this game if you get bored of the main arc.


For the its setting, the city of Rome was a blast to traverse, and while it was beautiful, you cannot be compared it with the iconic Firezene, mainly due to the lack of colours that were present and the little river divisions also provided another way to roam the city. Some may also argue that it was a shame only having one city. However, this enabled Ubisoft to detail the city to a greater extend, which turned out to be in our favour as there is little space that felt empty throughout the whole game.

As the name suggests,

the game is focused on broadening and strengthening your fellow assassins and retake what the influence of Borgia took from you. And from my review you can already guess that they had done a fantastic job of achieving just that. The ending will only make you more intrigued and you will desire to jump directly into Revelations.

But the result ended up being pretty great, so it's hard for me to criticize that line of thought too harshly. Despite suffering from a bit of creative bankruptcy, and a plot that kind of ends where it begins, Brotherhood is still extremely enjoyable to play.

The narrative is weaker than AC2, and the final act feels [i]extremely[/i] rushed (I suspect development crunched hard toward the end), but the same old supporting cast is as charming as ever, it's rewarding to watch a wiser and more mature Ezio ascend through the brotherhood, and the new primary antagonist is just so arrogant and vile and perfect, it's hard not to relish clashing with him.

The major mechanical addition in this title is the assassin recruitment system, which I actually found to be extremely enjoyable. Finding NPCs in need, recruiting them to the Order of Assassins, sending them on missions to gain experience, and finally having a little graduation ceremony, feels way more rewarding than is has any right to be. I really enjoyed the little bit of roleplay you get to engage in when selecting which assassins to send on certain missions, inventing little headcanon backstories, and summoning these companions in the midst of heated battle. This is a great system that really makes the game worth taking a look at, and summoning a legion of assassins to kill enemies around you while you just walk toward your target will never not feel incredibly cool.

It ties in nicely with the premise of the game, too: Ezio no longer feels like a brash young lone wolf fighting for revenge. He has disciples now, the European Order of Assassins is flourishing into a golden age under his guiding hand, and you really feel that in combat when you're surrounded by allies you've trained yourself. This is a really excellently realized marriage of theme with gameplay mechanic, and the devs deserve a lot of praise for it.

Important caveat for the PC version of this game, there are some pretty major known technical issues that Ubisoft never bothered to address, specifically with regards to a higher framerate causing issues and crashes. There's an anti-artillery minigame early on that is nearly impossible to win unless you cap the framerate a bit lower, and a cutscene near the end of the game will fail to trigger at high framerates as well.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is an amazing sequel to Assassin's Creed 2. It takes what was previously established in the first two games and builds on it in terms of lore, combat and side content. It is an incredible game which will always be special to me as I played it countless times throughout my childhood. Naturally because of the nostalgia that I get when I play this game, some of my opinions may be biased.

[b]Story[/b]
Once again you play as the master assassin Ezio Auditore and are tasked with assassinating one of the most powerful men in all of Italy. Set in the city of Rome, you must gather your allies and take back the city from this tyrant's rule. Bit by bit you work to reclaim Rome in a variety of ways, both during the main story and also in the side content. The main story is incredible however in my personal opinion it isn't quite as good as that of the previous two games mainly because it feels slightly more predictable, so there isn't the same element of mystery that there was in the other two games. With that being said, the modern day aspect of this game is definitely a huge improvement from the other 2 games and is probably the best in the whole franchise. 

[b]Side Content[/b]
The biggest improvement in this game is definitely the side content as it not only kept some of what was added in Assassin's Creed 2 but also improved some aspects and introduced some completely new things. The side missions in this game are great, some are quite basic like the courtesan or thief missions, however you also have some truly great missions like the war machine missions and the tomb missions which include some breathtaking set pieces. Finally, the settlement system has been greatly improved since Assassin's Creed 2 and has a lot more depth with more things to renovate and also includes towers which you must take down in order to carry out said renovations. This also gives this system more meaning than just a way to make money as it truly feels as though you are removing the enemies influence and control over the city. But what is really unique about all of this side content is that it all feels as if it helps further Ezio's goal to rid Rome of the enemies influence which in turn just gives it all more depth and meaning overall. 

[b]Brotherhood System[/b]
Another thing which is really unique and fun about this game is the assassin recruitment system which allows you to recruit citizens into the assassin brotherhood to join your fight. After recruiting some assassins you can then call upon them to help you assassinate targets, help in fights or you can even send them on missions across Europe. As you do all of those things, you can level up your recruits, watch as they develop their skills and flourish into a master assassin. I love this feature because it is really in depth and truly makes you feel as if you are raising an army of assassins to help in your fight to free the city. In my opinion, this paired with the side content is truly what makes this game stand out from the two games before it as you constantly feel like there is something to do and work towards.

[b]Combat[/b]
The combat in this game is really similar to Assassin's Creed 2 with similar weapons and abilities such as dodge, counter, sidestep ect. However, this game implements execution streaks which basically mean once you kill one enemy, you can kill the next with one hit. But if you get hit then the execution streak ends. In my opinion, this is a huge improvement on the combat system of Assassin's Creed 2 as it allows for some crazy satisfying moments where you can wipe out massive groups of enemies in seconds. Some other small changes they added was the ability to kick enemies to break their defence and the ability to use the hidden gun and throwing knives whilst using other weapons such as the sword and dagger, both of these are helpful additions.

[b]Parkour[/b]
The parkour system in this game works pretty much the exact same as it did in Assassin's Creed 2, which is completely fine as it was a masterpiece already. It allows you to climb most buildings and has the same wall eject abilities which appeared in the previous two games. Just like in Assassin's Creed 2, the parkour system can be very fun and incredibly satisfying because it gives the player so much control that they can do whatever they want. However, I have one slight complaint in that I feel like for the more expert parkour techniques, the map doesn't quite do the parkour system justice as much as the two previous games have. But that's just me being picky as the game still offers a lot of fun and unique ways to use it, especially in the tomb missions which I mentioned before.

[b]Music/Atmosphere[/b]
Just like the two games which came before it, the music and atmosphere of this game is incredible. Even though I have played through it countless times, it gives me chills every time I hear Ezio's Family (the song) play at the title screen. The general soundtrack you hear when exploring is also great too and even has different pieces of music which play in when you enter different parts of the map which also helps set the tone and atmosphere. This combined with the hubbub of the citizens and the heralds shouting at the top of their lungs, truly make the city of Rome feel alive and lived in.

[b]How It Holds Up[/b]
With all that being said, it is now time to talk about the state of the game. Now, personally in my experience my game run relatively well with only a few stutters and frame drops here and there. But overall nothing too bad and seeing as the game is almost 12 years old, (as of me making this) I was able to look past it. However, one thing which did annoy me quite a bit was that two of the missions are completely bugged. One mission being a side mission but the other being the final mission. Luckily the bugs were both really easy to fix. Nevertheless, it was still enough to break immersion and disrupt my experience. Due to this I would recommend playing the game at a maximum of 60hz with V-Sync turned on as this was the fix to both of these bugs. 

With that negative part out of the way, the game visually is a step up from Assassin's Creed 2. The overall graphics are much better with a lot more detail in character models and the environment. This game doesn't suffer from the same washy colour problem as Assassin's Creed 2 because the colours stand out much more and are more vibrant. Now, obviously the visuals aren't up to par with today's standards. However, I feel like this game still holds up really well for its age.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
In conclusion, although it has some minor problems, I still think Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is an amazing game which is definitely worth getting. Everything about this game is special and you won't know how good it truly is until you try it for yourself. So, go on! Buy the game already and enjoy the breathtaking experience which is Assassin's Creed Brotherhood!",1668022893,1668545420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a lot of running around, repetition, and predictability, but the story and large map is good enough to keep you engaged and interested, and doesn't feel particularly boring to play through. Fast travel and horse travel significantly helps reduce the amount of time you have to spend moving around.

The game as a whole feels somewhat easy and you can ignore a lot of the optional mechanics in the game like buying upgrades, investing, assassin contracts, and so on since they don't particularly affect the main story. Unfortunately, the requirements to fully synchronize certain missions is incredibly unbalanced, meaning that certain missions will be too long or too tedious to fully synchronize and are just not worth the trouble to bother with.

Overall, I'm giving the game an 8/10 mainly because of the story and how the game isn't a chore to play. In some instances I do quit to stop for the night because I get bored of errand running, but you're not supposed to speed run this game anyway. The game might realistically sport a 7/10, but keeping in mind that it was released in 2011, since games were more primitive back then, I loosened up my expectations a bit.

I think my only real disappointment with the game is probably with The Truth. It was amazing in AC2 because you could actually watch an interesting cutscene, but that wasn't in this game.

It innovates very little and follows diligently the path set in its predecessor. The little changes made ultimately make very little difference overall. On the other hand, it is a very enjoyable formula, and still is quite fun to play, so I cannot blame them. I would recommend you to Assassin's Creed 2 it first before you play this game, and maybe even Assassin's Creed 1 to get the full context.

The framing narrative is of Desmond Miles, who follows the memories of his ancestor, Ezio Auditore, through a virtual gaming device, to uncover information about magic artifacts set behind by a precursor alien civilisation. The main part of the game is spent playing the memories inside the 'Animus'.

As such, the game is mainly set in 16th century Rome, and once again you need to uncover conspiracies by a nefarious group aspiring to world domination and assassinate their leaders. Pretty standard stuff. Rome is fantastic place to explore, and full of pretty buildings. Ancient ruins from the Classical Era are abundant and form a part of the narrative. Both the crowded streets of Rome and the climable rooftops were fun to navigate through. It was also fun to compare to how the places were in real life, as I have actually visited Rome before and seen all the major sights.

Combat is still quite unbalanced, tedious and simple, and is made even easier by the fact that now you can kill several enemies by a combo attack. Adding to the frustration is how forced perspective and locking to enemies are very annoying during a group battle, and fighting on a horse or against a enemy on horseback is quite buggy and unintuive. Combat definitely is not a strength of the AC franchise. Later on different mechanics, such as assassin signalling, smoke bombs, crossbows and poison darts add some variety for available methods in combat, but unfortunately they end up making the game even easier.

Some memories now also have special requirements to reach 100% synchronisation score, which will unlock some special memories. While some of the sync challenges are fun and require creative thinking, oftentimes it is tedious chore. During my first playthrough, the requirements also spoil out what will happen during the memory, before you even play it.",1659914329,1666880889,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Fantastic progression of Ezio's story with a massive expansion in an already wide variety of mechanics present in AC2, the presence of the brotherhood and NPC interactions in this game are far more fleshed out and add a surprising depth to the game. The story is once again deeply engaging, and the game has no shortage of massive set pieces and explosions. The horse mechanics are also fluid and fun.

The bad:
Horse driving can sometimes be buggy when on rough terrain, some plot points feel slightly useless in this game and lead to nothing.

Bottom Line:
When discussing the AC games, most people would place brotherhood in their top 3. It was a well-made compelling experience with memorable character development arcs. Also most of the bugs in AC2 were dealt with in this game.

[b]Comment:[/b]
We continue our adventure with Ezio. While AC2 felt like a huge step from AC1, in this case the changes are not that big. Ubisoft left the basics from what made AC2 great and added a whole bunch of extra stuff. This time it is just one city - Rome, that is divided into 4 districts. Still present is a really good storyline where Ezio is already established but builds up his brotherhood of assassins. The game is still fun and has lots of side missions to keep you occupied for hours. However, some types become a bit repetitive and the 100% requirements for many missions are just plain annoying. But I guess this is to counteract the fact that once you have you assassins that you can call upon the game goes into easy mode. So the only real challenge comes from the artificial requirements of the 100% completion system. The combat is the same as in AC2. Main assassinations are again great and fun, each playing out a bit differently to mix things up a bit. This time we see more of the Desmond timeline of which I am a fan. Some flaws are funky camera placement in some cases and sometimes weird AI. I would complain about uPlay but you all know what playing Ubisoft games is like. You simply need a uPlay account. Otherwise the game itself is awesome and while slightly worse than AC2 it still is worth your money. Recommended!

Pros:
1. Ezio is the lead. 'Nuf said.
2. The weapons improved significantly from AC II.
3. It's a really fun game to waste time in considering how many collectables and stuff there are.
4. The plot for the most part is quite intriguing and some missions are insanely epic.
5. It's very stable-I think it only crashed twice in the flying machine mission on my pc.

Cons:
1. The game expects you to play a certain way- and if you don't you won't get 100% completion (I literally finished the main plot and was below 50%)
2. There's a lot of collectibles (can be annoying) and the stuff going on in the background can take a bit of time to figure out.

48190,123519219,76561199043643467,0,5,3579,0,3009,1696129250,"  This is easily the best Assassins creed game. I've put hours of my time into about every Assassins creed game, and this one is by far the best. The story is set in Rome and takes place right after Assassins creed 2. You work in this game as Ezio, to destroy the Borgias and liberate Rome from their clutches. This improved on everything in Assassins creed 2, making itself the best in the series. The world is expansive, and the gameplay is immaculate. Throughout the game you're able to build a brotherhood by recruiting assassins and slowly upgrading them. You can call upon them at any time to assassinate enemies. The world itself is really alive, and the city is really fun to explore. While this game only has one city compared to assassins creed 2 which had a Florence, Venice, and a couple of small areas I'm between, it makes up for all of the content that's been packed in. There're really and I mean really fun side missions. Especially the ones with Leonardo where you have to go destroy blueprints for his machines. The stealth in this game is so creative. You have a gun on your wrist, throwing knives, a crossbow, and poison darts. These gadgets allow you to express yourself through creativity when doing stealth missions. The combat itself though is easy and quite smooth. I do feel like the fighting systems in these games should be a bit more difficult, they should also feel smooth and quick. After countering one enemy and killing them, Ezio is given the ability to freely eliminate another enemy. The weapon variety in this game is massive and allows you to hold heavy weapons now. If you pick up an enemies heavy weapon, you have the ability to throw it and get a ranged kill on another enemy. Such weapons include spears, big swords, and axes. As for what Ezio wears, you can dye your clothes and cape in this game and you can get some quite appealing colors that allow for some player expression. They offer some special armor in this game which is the Armor of Brutus which I would suggest doing some research on because once you get it, you can't take it off. It's not the most appealing piece of clothing but that's subjective. I feel like a leveling system doesn't really fit Assassins creed that well, it makes the player feel restricted and could possible shy them away from the game from the start. That's why in this game, to ""level up"" you buy and obtain new equipment. Whether it be through armor, weapons, gadgets, or recruited assassins, this game does it very well. While many people are starting to argue now that Unity has the best parkour of all the games, I begin to disagree as it was the Ezio games that had the most impressive system. Unity has really smooth animations while also keeping a decent amount of controls you must press in the game which make it feel satisfying. But when you compare it to a game like brotherhood, your capabilities are exponentially higher. This game allows you to side eject and have more control over your movement. How many times in Unity has Arno start running in a direction that you didn't have him run in, or just waited a couple seconds for him to actually climb something. Assassins creed brotherhood allows you to press a button, and has and instant action. I can see why many people would be turned off by the parkour though, sometimes Ezio jumps in a direction you didn't expect him to jump, but that's what you told him to do through your controls. That means the parkour system is a bit more difficult, but that's the fun of it. The city designs require you to stay relatively focused when traversing them as apposed to Unity. Unity takes away a lot of actions but because they slapped some smooth parkour, it looks good. If the Ezio games had these modern animations with superfluous actions in them, it'd be praised. But because Ezio does the basic movements it's not as appreciated. There're many characters in this game, and each and everyone of them feel like real people. The voice actors do a good job of making people feel alive. With a lot of games, you always feel like skipping cut scenes, but I find myself hooked by them. Many of the cut scenes are high quality and a lot of the jokes are funny. Ultimately, Assassins creed brotherhoood is the best assassins creed game, and I believe it's worth your time and money. It's expansive with it's world and allows for player expression and creativity through gameplay and customization.

Let it be known that Ubisoft was going to REMOVE access to GAMES (not just DLC) that people had already paid for:

https://i.imgur.com/DOWz9ed.png

At one point, these games were also de-listed from the store, and no longer available for purchase. This was done after they went on sale during the Steam summer sale.

Now Ubisoft has backtracked (probably due to negative PR) and will only be ""decommissioning online services"" for these old titles. This effectively means no more multiplayer, and no DLC (unless you've already activated it and tied it to your Uplay account).

https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/gameplay/article/decommissioning-of-online-services-for-older-ubisoft-games-october-2022-update/000102396

Even though the online services have been shut down, they *still* ask you to sign up for a ""Ubisoft Connect"" account, and log in to Ubisoft's servers. However, launching the game with ""-playoffline"" bypassed that requirement.

Due to Ubisoft and their terrible practices, I cannot recommend this game or any other Ubisoft title, nor will I purchase future Ubisoft products.

Ubisoft, if you want to shut down online services for old games, fine, but remove your crappy DRM as well. Between this fiasco, and that Ubisoft dev trying to criticize Elden Ring (which is better than anything Ubisoft ever put out) I am done with Ubisoft.

Find others to join the creed to help you defeat the Templars and save Italy.

I enjoyed my experience playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. There were some flaws/bugs that I encountered; however, it was still a playable and enjoyable experience. The crossbow and other gadgets are great additions to the arsenal of the master assassin. Play this game, not only for the fun experience, but because it's Ezio Auditore, truly one of the best assassins.

The controls, as with the Assassin's Creed 2 are garbage. You are a millimeter away from a wall and you want to run to the road, nope up the wall with you (change the wall with well/haystack and it's the same).
I hated the tailing missions, they are purposely long and tedious. I speed up the game speed and you can see there how it walks in circles some times. Also the ""catch the enemy"" missions are also boring and samey. It's always the same, if you fall a little bit behind they wait for you.
Why not make a simpler, more realistic, because I don't believe a 70 old cardinal can outrun me, it's simply stupid.

Also the main story missions are really short and spreeeead really apart and you are forced to do tedious side missions that are all the same tail, steal or kill. How innovative.

Also the ending of the first game in the trilogy was so stupid I was more critical this time. Not killing the pope? Couldn't they make a more believable scenario in which Cesare attacks you, because he wants to avenge his father's death?
Plotwise the it's ok, but some parts are like a preeschooler would write them.

Edit: Also there are a loot of bugs/glitches. Like you can't fly if you don't have V-Sync enabled and locked to 60fps, wtf???

EDIT2:  During my playtime in Revelation's I found out that in the Brotherhood if you synced at least 75% the last Cristina mission appeares <spoiler> in which she dies</spoiler>.

Whether they have to buy it, or if you update the base game to automatically include all the DLC. If you take that route, make sure it still counts as DLC and is listed as such on steam and/or in game, so people can verify they got the DLC.

They never even clarify what ""activating it"" means. What does this mean? Are you referring to redeeming any codes I might have? Do you mean, download the game AND dlc? Start the game? Make sure that it is listed in your DLC section under properties in your library? What do you mean by ""activating"" it? Even being upper-moderate tech savvy I have no definitive conclusion what you mean by this, only guesses. You don't tell me exactly what to do to ""activate it,"" even though that is an incredibly commonplace practice. You don't provide pictures and a guide, let alone a brief description of the process.
It boggles my mind how you are legally able to do this, but also how you can give such absolutely useless instructions to those who want to keep what they have already purchased. 

As for the Ubisoft connect rewards, put them into the base game. Simply update the game to automatically include them. No connection required, you can then leave the game forever, unless you cause another issue of course. If you're going to abandon your products, do it right. 

OG Review:
Leaving this review here to remind myself to look for the DLC when I get around to playing the game.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the direct continuation of the second game of this beloved series. Ezio returns in his strongest form, to rebuild and lead his Creed into a dangerous war across beautiful 16th century Rome. Featuring yet another solid narrative, further gameplay enhancements and the same beloved protagonist. This is true Assassin's Creed in its most dominant form, the series might have gotten bigger after that, but I reckon it never got better.

[b]Positives:[/b]
+ A solid continuation of the previous game's narrative. Story is once again centered around the Borgia family, with new and returning characters involved. Brotherhood closes the Borgia story and it does so in a satisfying way, simultaneously advancing the story of Desmond to interesting levels.
+ Gameplay is pushed even further. Featuring the Assassin recruits system, which allows Ezio to command his followers in battle. The game also features new weapons and further improved combat system. Optional mission objectives were also added here, allowing players to repeat missions in order to get 100% synchronization.
+ Rome remains the best Assassin's Creed setting to date, in my opinion. This was the first game to feature a single city as its map and it really allowed for much more attention to detail. The city feels alive and interesting, with distinctive neighborhoods and people. The rebuilding system from the previous game also returns here, allowing Rome to reach its full potential once completely rebuilt.
+ A lot of interesting side content - One of the main issues with Assassin's Creed II was the lack of interesting side content. Ubisoft learned their lesson and made the optional activities in Brotherhood one of the strongest in the whole series. Leonardo's War Machines are peak side missions, but there are also the memories of Cristina, faction assignements and Templar Agents.
+ Just like its predecessor, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood features a stellar soundtrack composed by Jesper Kyd.
+ The armor upgrading system and economy also return here, for the most part they remain the same as in the previous installment.
+ Assassin Recruits are easily one of the best aspects of the whole series. As official mentor of the Creed, Ezio can send his allies to do his job. You can order one of your recruits to assassinate a key target without ever having to get your hands dirty. It is really satisfying!

[b]Negatives:[/b]
- Memory corridors with dying templars are still not satisfying enough. They are improved a little bit compared to the second game, but still lack the long meaningful dialogues we had in the original.
- Parkour is basically identical to the previous installment of the series. That is definitely not a ""bad"" thing, but I wish we saw further improvements in this one.

[b]Overall:[/b]
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the peak of Assassin's Creed due to its combination of different solid aspects. It does not feature the single best story of the franchise, that still goes to the second game. Its gameplay is also rivaled by some of the other games, but what this one has over the rest is decent quality in all aspects. None of the newer games managed to find the balance between these things and always felt short in some key areas. It is precisely why to this day, Brotherhood remains the best game of the franchise for me. I give it a solid [b]9/10[/b] and recommend everyone to try it out.

The game looks noticeably much better than AC2 and the combat is much more fun, if at the expense of difficulty. There is also a monstrous amount of content compared to the previous game. You have: puzzle minigames, guild challenges, a bunch of unique side missions, a virtual training time trial thing where you can challenge your parkour and combat skills, a whole economy system, a multiplayer mode, and so much more.

There were also a few additions that I felt were just to check some boxes and added no value to the game, such as the sometimes infuriating optional mission objectives that are required to get 100% sync. I also did notice that this game ran a lot worse than AC2, with stuttering framerates and pretty bad pop-in (be sure to cap your game at 60fps because it kind of breaks if you go above). There is also this very strange 'vignette' that takes up the upper third of your screen and is quite noticeable in darker areas. 

Shame though that Ubisoft is pulling all online functionality (including access to DLCs) on October 1st. Inexcusable behaviour that makes them the laughing stock of the gaming industry at the moment. This game will still be enjoyable after that (thus the positive review) but keep in mind that you'll be missing out on some content come October 1st.",1657952333,1663973062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is well paced but not perfect, I certainly think that while its nice that Ezio is proactive instead of being lead around it would have been good if the other members and his sister towards the end had more of an impact, i would have liked to see them in the climax making a difference, the last chapter turns into dynasty warriors of you being the only character doing anything.

The worst part for me for the arc with the french general, it just started and ended very quickly and it just seemed a bit random and not very serious. Compare the invasion at the start of the game to that, one has cannons blowing up walls with people panicking while the other has a couple dozen soldiers it doesnt feel like a war or skirmish and you got random common people just walking around normally during it.

Control wise its a bit annoying, there are times where you get stuck on walls next to areas you should be able to climb, combat feeels sluggish at times but then feels buttery smooth when you get a both of finisher animations combos going. Other annoying parts are gunners on horses, you can easily get stun locked by two gunners on horses so regardless of how many potions you have they can kill you annoyingly so. Having four states for walking speed is ridiculous and im glad later games removed it. 

Optimisation is a bit weird, this will only use one core so you better bet your single core performance is good or it might stutter, my Ryzen 7 3700x is great but this still dipped to 40fps every now and then at 4k. 

All that aside though this game looks surprisingly good for a PS3/xbox360 title. Aside from low res shadows and no real time timing this could be confused for a modern AA release. 

To conclude this game holds up and is still fun to play, parts with frustrate you but its still fun, the historic story is engaging I dont really care about the real world stuff though.",1662576421,1662576421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

90% of missions (main ,sides and other assignment) are time bound.yes compared to AC2 this game has improved features, game play,story and good rpg touch with great background musics but this time bound thing hampers overall gaming experience.this game is good but sadly i could not experience it fully...the environment ,the background music during missions.....no ....all i have to focus is on the tik tik time counter.

It wouldn't be like that if this game didn't exist to make them forget about just how bad AC 2 really is. The only things that are slightly worse about this game compared to the first 2 is that AC 1 is arguably slightly harder, AC 1 arguably has slightly better combat, AC 2 has arguably slightly better movement, AC 2 has more historical areas and events, and the open world is so big it takes away from the great story. I can't express to you how much I loved this game when it imersed me into its story and world. However, the issue is that much of the time, this is hurt by the open world. The open world concepts are decent and by far the best up till this point if you are looking purely at their content.

Some say AC2 is better that AC:B but I cant judge because I cant take any more of this bs game mechanics. The game is amazing for its story, characters and phenomenal music but besides that it feels like trash. 

Maybe its because I'm playing with a mouse and keyboard that the game feels like it has absolutely fckall decent movement flow but that doesn't explain the constant lag to look in the direction I want the btch to look. The combat is bland, climbing buildings feels more like a hassle that making me feel more than if I was just walking on the ground and I always make mistakes in the game because of bs gaming mechanics. I accept that this is an old game but ffs this is not what I wanted when I spent my money on this game.

Now keep in mind, Im not talking about this game alone, I am speaking about the whole Ezio collection from AC2 to AC:B and AC:R, I'm just to fckn lazy to make comments on all three games (or maybe I did for AC2 last year. I needed to take a year break before deciding to come back to this game). I finished AC2 hoping that the mechanics were gonna improve the next game but hell no it didn't. They just added a new one use elevator system in the game and made using the map more difficult. 

Sorry if you feel this comment was a waste of time reading but I need to address these issues hoping to change other peoples minds about buying the games that Ubisoft clearly doesn't give a rats ass about anymore. I'm just fckn pissed.

The best Assassin's Creed game In my opinion. 2 reasons which are the story and Ezio.
Of course, the first Assassin's Creed is great, the story and all but the world is not like the one in the second and Brotherhood.

I'd suggest you get this game if you like historical games, the gameplay is great, the story is amazing, the characters are superb.

By the way, I've spent more than 100 hours on this game outside of steam, I've play from scratch many times.

Edit 2022: As of now, Ubisoft wants to go full illegal, worthless and a***ole.
They will remove the online element and the access to the DLCs, removing online is one thing but the access to the DLCs we paid for? That's illegal, no matter what an EULA says, it cannot go above the laws, and for this, Ubisoft should go bankrupt and to never be seen again, it's nothing new though, Ubisoft has been a cancer for a long time now so i doubt that anything will happen to them even though they are evil and worthless but that's just how it is, in a good World where common sense and goodwill would exist, Ubisoft wouldn't.
Simply do not pay for their stuff, it's not even worth for free at this point.
If Ubisoft does such thing, it will passes, but they will go after you if you get their stuff for free, that's a company that you should simply not encourage at all, let them die.

Yes, I am a console peasant who doesn't like playing these type of games without a controller. There are more of us out here than many of the computer ubermenschen want to admit. We can play this Assassin Creed game without having to learn a new set of controls. 

There's more here to praise than just the controller support. Along with the usual Assassin Creed parkour, period accuracy, and combat you are given the option to send out your own assassins to carry out side missions while you deal with the main one. A great feature that allows you to train and equip them. Also you can buy and upgrade parts of the city, like in Assassin Creed 2.

Unfortunately Ubisoft insists on the present-day Animus story. And it takes a while before the game opens up. Which means you get to watch a movie instead of play a game. I liked the game enough to finish it on the Play Station 3. I know there is some sort of ridiculous story involving Assassins and Templars, but I don't remember if it is good. Most of the Assassin Creed stories seem stupid to me. One of the better Assassin games.

You have probably heard that Ubisoft will shut down the DLC for some older games like Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood, which is a great game. Not just the multiplayer mode will be shut down, but singleplayer story DLC as well!! I have paid for this, but they take it away?? I have never heard such a thing before. Normally, even if a game is delisted and not for sale anymore, buyers keep their games and DLC they bought. The DLC is an important part of this game, without it’s incomplete. Ubisoft doesn’t care about game preservation, they are greedy and anti-customer. It's unfair to customers and to the people who developed these games.

Understand this: No matter how big and popular a game is now, Ubisoft will take it offline at some point in the future. Their games have an expiration date. Then you have an incomplete game or no game at all anymore, although you paid for it. Don’t bother to buy the newest Assassin’s Creed, Splinter Cell or whatever, because it will be gone. What’s the point of investing your time and money into something, which will be taken away from you?

Ubisoft decided to crank up the mechanics of the game, continue the amazing story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze and add some goodies along the way with more new challenges!.

Still, I'll be honest... It took me a couple of hours to get into the game due to the fact I felt it slow, but my best advice is keep playing it! After those first few hours the game grows to an absolute great living world with quests and whatnot!

The game being this old obviously suffers from two smaller system related issues. One is the controller, so if you're using an XBox Controller it will leave you at defaul, which gets quite easy to catch after a few tries and then the screen stutter, which can be solved and there's a few solutions out there on how to solve it and keep the game running smootly.

Overall, a great game and a MUST to experience for all players that want to play the AC saga or do the whole marathon, like I'm doing!

At the time couldn't imagine they'd be able to do any better again but they absolutely did. Much like how 2 was a direct upgrade in every way from the previous one so was brotherhood. The ability to recruit, call in, and level up assassins is the coolest/most fun feature they've ever added to an Assassins Creed game. Finally feels like you're actually apart of an assassin group/guild and not just doing everything yourself all the time. The story itself is the best as well, the outfit is the best looking, the combat the smoothest (adding the ability to chain together kills is amazing), seeing Ezio during his most influential years on the brotherhood(basically rebuilding it) too is great, and the out of animus scenes for the first time in the series were fun and actually had true gameplay(not just searching a room for clues or running around a warehouse).

[list]
	[*]Great game with an amazing story! Both still hold up so many years later.
	[*]Cool little details, such as how in the prologue (and I think the Cristina missions?) the game imports your money from your AC2 save, and during combat the crowds react to execution moves and such.
	[*]Enemies are more likely to drop bullets now so guns are much more widespread.
	[*]Grab Break, Guard Break (if you could call the kick attack that) and Vigilantes (who have now been upgraded to trash-talk any guards nearby) were brought back from AC1 - the Save Citizen missions were even brought back too (though you unlock them through story progression) with the ability to recruit the citizens.
	[*]Cool new profit system that makes you a lot of money (more than Monteriggioni). It introduces a store investment system that makes investments more riskier depending on how many other players have invested in the store (though I imagine the servers for this have been long shut down, or that only a few souls play this game anymore as every store shows as being low risk for me).
	[*]With the new economy comes a lot of things (renovated storefronts, expensive landmarks, tunnel entrances, etc) to buy to keep you from building up insane amounts of money like in AC2.
	[*]The Assassins recruitment that you unlock in the story is really cool.
	[*]Checkpoints are a lot better now, though for completionists it kinda doesn't matter since if you fail the additional objective and you want to complete it you have to restart the entire mission.
	[*]Good soundtrack, though in my opinion it isn't as good as AC2's.
	[*]Assassin arrow storm is a lifesaver on some of the BS stealth missions.
	[*]I don't think the game ever tells you this (or if it was in any of the prequels), but you can 'charge' up the throwing knives to hit multiple targets at once. This is super useful as it also one-shots most enemies that can survive more than 1 throwing knife.
	
[/list]

[h2]The Bad:[/h2]
[list]
	[*]Devs never even thought of a 'restart from checkpoint' option.
	[*][spoiler]Mario's death made me die inside.[/spoiler]
	[*]Combat is made even easier than the prequel, as enemies drop a useful items such as medicine more frequently.
	[*]Pistol firing takes a bit of getting used to, in AC2 you could fire it as quick as you wanted (with an accuracy penalty if you fired before the shot was fully lined up); however in AC: Brotherhood it feels like you HAVE to wait for the shot to be lined up, in addition to a second or two, before the game actually lets you fire - this makes quick shots on enemies hard sometimes.
	[*]Horses can't jump down from 3 foot ledges.	
	[*]*Beats up doctor* SYNCHRONISATION FAILED: DO NOT KILL DOCTOR	
	[*]Some stealth missions are made artificially harder by having some enemies hidden from the minimap, what's the point of the minimap then?
	[*]Game likes to auto-switch your weapons during combat to screw you over, such as switching to the hidden blade when trying to shoot a charging guard on a horse (I once even had the game switch to the hidden blade during a fist fight with a guy I pickpocketed).
	[*]Enemies can do an annoying split-second sprint attack that I don't think Ezio can perform.
	[*]You have to memorise which bodies you have looted because if you try to loot one that has been looted already the game makes you pick it up and drop it again which gets super annoying.
	[*]Got to the end of the mission where you have to kill a guy - instead of killing the target, the game makes me kill some RANDOM CIVILIAN who I wasn't even looking at, game proceeds to fail the addition objective (only kill the gunmen) and makes me do the mission again. I actually despise this game sometimes.
	[*]Game takes away your money accumulated and gives you your notoriety back when you restart a memory, but doesnt give you your assassin signals back? Thanks game.
	[*]Funny how in the trailer for the first game (and I think AC2 and this game) it showed the protagonist escaping a chase by blending with civilians, yet you can't even do it in this game.
	[*]Hiding spots are straight up useless during chases, its feels like wherever you hide an enemy is programmed to search it eventually before they stop looking for you.
	[*]There's one super cancer mission where you have to chase a courtesan and only kill the ambassador she leads you to. Sound easy right? Nope, during the chase the game will pretty much take control, making you climb up walls you weren't even looking at, and killing the ambassador alone is another story: if you simply try to shoot him, the game while switch lock on to a different enemy to throw you off and try to get you to fail, and if you poison him 9 times out of 10 the game will switch the hidden blade, do an execution move on him, and automatically chain execute a nearby enemy to try to make you fail.
	[*]How the hell can you not block/counter a spear attack with a heavy axe.
	[*]Enemies on horseback are immune to throwing knives, hopefully this is a bug and Ubi didn't actually think this was a good idea. Also you can't knock them off the horse by damaging it, despite the fact they can do it to you.
	[*]The detection bar is pointless, as in some missions enemies just can instantly detect you before it even fills.
	[*]Ezio never killed civilians... except when the game made him do so when he wasn't even aiming for them (it feels like the game prioritises civilians when it comes to double assassinations).
    [*]Just like AC2, crowd blending is a bit broken at times as when you need it most it never works, and guards can just disable it when it does.
    [*]Annoying contextual camera in some linear parkour situations that causes Ezio to jump where you aren't even aiming.
	[*]The game disables your running jump ability during some chases to allow enemies that block your path to hit you - annoying artificial difficulty.
	[*]The 8 minute speedrun extra objectives for the Romulus Lairs are annoying since you don't get time to explore.
[/list]

[h2]The IDK:[/h2]
[list]
	[*]The useful quickstep feature was relegated to double-tapping WASD, I personally found this clunky to use at the start but got used to it.
	[*]For some reason the Borgia Captains feel to be more prone to fleeing than the armoured mook soldiers.
	[*]The pistol can be used for long-range stealth kills, you just have to lock on to an enemy, walk about 10m-15m away from them and shoot them. For some reason, locking on to an enemy increases the pistol's effective range than if you were to aim at them manually and fire it without, and enemies will not react to you shooting if you are far enough away.
	[*]Not really an issue for me, but buying paintings is pretty useless now as you don't get extra income from them. You can still read about them in the headquarters though which is good.
	[*]The new chain execution move is cool, but the game literally	chain executes enemies with no input from the player, usually this isn't an issue but when you're trying to kill specific enemies (or avoid killing more than 1 enemy in a crowd) this is annoying.
	[*]The 'French' soldiers speak Italian (except for their scripted dialogue in story missions) and are just blue reskins of the Borgia guards.

A great successor to the previous AC game (AC2) and I can not wait to finish Ezio's story in the next game (AC Revelations)

Gameplay - AC2 but better. You do the same generic stuff of run around, kill ppl involved in the story yada yada, but they made it a bit more.. easy? Now you can basically chain kill which completely negates every single fight you are in. Just counter, 1 shot a guard and then one shot everyone who dares look you funny. They changed the viewpoint system by adding Borgia Generals (Basically now viewpoints are guarded by bad guys) and you can pretty much ignore them and just do the viewpoint, or if you are like me, just straight up destroy them. On top of that, you gotta Open shops else, no blacksmith, no medicine, no tailor, and most importantly, NO FAST TRAVEL. So, if you are pretty much in need of these things, you have to destroy the Borgia General thing and yea now you can open stuff up. The grind is much much much less than AC2, I found myself not even chasing thieves after like 2 hours into the game coz the game will give you enough money to pretty much steam roll through the game. They added horse riding, and well, that's kinda fun? I never used the horse that much. Finally, the best thing, the Assassin's. You can call in Assassin's to do the dirty work for you. You wanna kill Borgia General? Get in range, call Assassin, PEW - DEAD. The game was way shorter, almost half the length of AC2, so, I'm kinda disappointed in the length? But hey, the story was nice :) 

Graphics - AC2 but better graphics - So much better graphics. Don't worry, it will work with the minimum specs, I got it working before on an i3 system with no graphics card so - it's not bad :)

Music - Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooothing

The world - Smaller than AC2 tbh, you hardly had much, maybe like 2 places? Roma and the end game area.. The entire time all you do is roam around in Roma. Don't get me wrong, its detailed as hell. I already explained about the world in the Gameplay section soooooo, check that out :)

Difficulty - 1/10 Difficulty - OK SO, I am basically triggered at myself for even dying in this game because of how EASY THIS GAME IS! LIKE LITERALLY, I died again, only 4 times.. No cap. Here is how I died:

1 - Died coz guard shot me with a crossbow which made me fall down
2 - Died coz guard shot me with a crossbow and I didn't have medicine halfway into the mission
3 - Died coz of jumping off the building 
4 - Died coz of jumping off the building

That is how I died 4 times in this game. Tbh, Now that they added a chain execution streak, you can pretty much destroy an entire army (like in AC Revelations Trailer XD) if you just counter when someone attacks you. Trust me when I say this, Do NOT grind and spend more than 5k on a sword - you won't need it. The only time I used swords was at the end or when guards came on horsebacks. That's it - 99% of the time, I used my blade and it melted the entire army. Trust me, you won't ever find this game hard unless you don't know how to counter when being smacked by large groups of enemies. So they technically made it easier coz of the execution streak. (P.S IT IS FUN AS CRAP!)

Bugs - Ok so here is my bug report - In sequence 9, there is a bug where (No spoilers) Story Dude just stands still on a castle. Yea, just stands still and doesn't move, and guards just keep coming. You can not damage him, and can't progress. If you are reading this review, here is a fix. Open settings, Toggle OFF Vsync (if it is turned ON) and turn it back ON again. Next, return to main menu and continue the story. Bug Fixed. That was the only bug in the game.

AI - I absolutely was not a fan of the AI in this game but whatever, old game yada yada. Tailing mission - sounds simple - THE GUY I'M TAILING, BUMPS INTO A CROWD OF 3 PPL AND TURNS AROUND AND COMES TOWARDS ME. LIKE BRO! IM COMING FROM LIKE 50 MTRS AWAY RUNNING AT YOU! DAFUQ YOU WANT ME TO DO? RUN AWAY? AND FOR SOME REASON, I GET INSTANTLY SPOTTED COZ OF THIS STUPIDITY. For some reason, If i kill the guy who Detects me once the blade goes through him and he dies, I automatically fail the mission coz everyone knows where I am? Like what kind of logic is this Ubisoft? EXPLAIN? Oh, when I basically send 4 assassin's to kill 3 guards, I get detected? AFTER THEY DIE? LIKE BRO? WHAT?

Worth the price - ABSOLUTELY - GET THIS GAME - If you are tight on a budget, you'll be surprised how good of a game it is for the price, maybe wait for sale if money is an issue, but otherwise, pretty solid game for your money. ALSO - SCREW YOU UBISOFT FOR REMOVING DLC PAST SEPTEMBER!

Final Verdict - 8.5/10 - GREAT 

BUY BUY BUY ABSOLUTELY WORTH A BUY! EZIO TRILOGY IS WORTH PLAYING ATLEAST 1 TIME :)

Bear in mind that there's been nine Assassin's Creed titles to follow this one, not to mention that these first few games were a big stepping stone on which many open world developers would build and elaborate on. Later Assassin's Creed games would further elaborate on the climbing mechanics, the Batman Arkham games have a simply superior combat system, and in the case of Brotherhood, the assassin followers you acquire can be compared to Talion's orc followers in the recent Middle-Earth games. No single system in this game can be pointed out as being better than any other game in the market, but I still found it to be fun.

PRESENTATION:

Overall, this game looks pretty similar to the previous entry, which is to say it looks perfectly fine, although you can expect loads of pop-in no matter what machine you're running. I don't pretend to have the best performing computer out there, but it's been twelve years, the fault of this goes squarely to the developers. This can be especially noticeable when you notice a poorly rendered human face, which looks both terrifying and hilarious.

Another thing to mention is the overall variety of the map itself. While the developers do plenty with the location they are given, (Rome is, after all, one of the most important cities in human history, so it's no surprise that there are plenty of interesting landmarks) I can't help but miss the variety of the multiple cities of AC II, where you could visit Florence, Venice, and Forli, among other locations. As a function of the narrative, I preferred to go on a vast quest not just in a single city, but across large swaths of the Italian countryside.

GAMEPLAY:

To start, the combat is super easy. You just have to wait to counter an enemy, and once you have done that, you can just spam the attack button and watch as virtually all of your enemies fall nearly instantly. If you're in trouble, you can use a smoke bomb, or instantly heal by using medicine with the tap of a key. There's next to no threat of death in this game, so if you happen to get desynchronized, expect it to be from accidental leaps to your doom or failed mission objectives, particularly of the frustrating instant-fail stealth kind. 

Speaking of which, the stealth is also pretty underdeveloped by today's standards. The amount of options when approaching a stealth scenario pales in comparison to more recent entries. There's no ability to whistle to attract guards, take cover, hide in bushes, use sleep darts, and most of the ranged tools in your disposal become irrelevant with the introduction of the crossbow and the arrow storm.

The saving grace of a game that I feel is pretty dated is the climbing. While it is definitely slower and less fluid compared to newer games, what is missing from said newer games is a parkour system designed to make the player think about how to get to a destination. In the first four AC games, you can't simply hold the climb button, go towards the direction you want to, and expect to get there just as fast compared to if you used all of the tools in your disposal to free run more deliberately. For example, the wall eject, side eject, leap of faith, and the tackle may seem only relevant to the more scripted parts of the game at first, but a skilled player can use all of these tools in order to get from point A to B much faster. It's also worth mentioning that you can call a horse to make traversal even faster, but the free running in this game was so much fun that I would only call a horse in time-trial missions or in the countryside, where there was no place to climb.

The assassins you recruit during the runtime are a great addition to the gameplay. You recruit them while they are fighting Borgia troops, and in order to upgrade them, you must send them on missions all across Europe at the cost of them being temporarily unavailable. While the meta-game of assigning recruits on these missions is pretty brain-dead, it's the reward of them returning, leveling up, and becoming even more powerful recruits in stealth and combat that makes this system fulfilling. There is a catch, however. Remember the courtesans, thieves, and mercenaries from AC II, that you could hire to do various things for you? In this game, they are made so irrelevant by your fellow assassins that they may as well not even exist.

MISSIONS:

Outside of the main campaign, the only missions I would strongly recommend would be the Cult of Romulus tombs, the Leonardo missions, and the rare Cristina missions. All of the Cult of Romulus missions, Cristina Missions, and most of the Leonardo missions will take you to a brand new location. Beyond that, missions are pretty cookie cutter. Expect a lot of trailing missions, missions where you must locate your objective, as well as a handful of other mission types. In particular, some sequences in this game with a lot of potential are bogged down by boring mission objectives. Take sequence 5 in the main story for example. The overall objective is to assassinate a banker, which sounds exciting, but here's the rundown for each mission:

Mission 1: Escort mission, where your escort is occasionally attacked by guards
Mission 2: Tailing mission, which ends with infiltrating the Pantheon
Mission 3: Basically an escort mission, where you travel slower than usual
Mission 4: An assassination, where you tail and kill your target
Mission 5: A cutscene

Notice how there are only 2 parts which sound like fun, being mission 4, and the part in mission 2 where you infiltrate the Pantheon. This is what you can expect out of most sequences in this game, and it makes me wonder why they can't just cut some of the more tedious stuff out. It would make this game a lot more exciting, and the pacing a lot more brisk by comparison. 

In terms of the side content, the Cult of Romulus missions play out much like the tombs in the previous game, but with a bit less variety in the locations. Despite this, they're still plenty of fun, and I would recommend playing through all of them. Secondly, the Leonardo missions are arguably the highlight for me. These (and the Cristina missions) are the only side content where you are actually outside the city of Rome, and they feel fresh as a result. For these missions, you must destroy design blueprints and take one of Leonardo's inventions out for a spin. While many of these missions have gotten flak for the terrible handling of some of these machines, I actually found them quite fun to use for the 5-10 minutes in which they are included, if only because they shake up the gameplay.

Approach the rest of the game sparingly, as you will quickly discover and become bored by the copy-paste nature of a lot of the side content, including the Courtesan and Copernico missions.

EXTRA NOTES:
The lower ratings as of late are a result of the multiplayer, multiplayer DLC, and single player DLC being inaccessible starting this September 1st. I never play multiplayer in these games, neither did I bother with the single player DLC, but keep that in mind when you see a lower score than what it may have been before the news broke.

OVERALL:
There were some other things I would like go into detail here, such as the plot and characters, and the means by which you can acquire certain gadgets and upgrades, but unfortunately I just discovered while writing this review that Steam has a word limit, so in short, I would recommend this game, just bear in mind that when you play it, it is quite similar to AC II, and it has all of the open-world tropes that many people are sick of by now. I think it's worth the 20 dollar asking price today, but it's not in the upper pantheon of Assassin's Creed games that are recommendable to anyone who plays video games. You should play AC II first, be engaged in the story of Ezio Auditore, and not be completely burnt out by open-world games in order to enjoy this game like me.

In general in my opinion Ezio & Altair stories are the best for the Assassin's Creed. 

[b] This game deserved more love [/b] 

Ubisoft launched the ""Ezio Collection"" for PlayStation 4, Xbox and Nintendo Switch. They never gave an opportunity for those with a PC to experience the complete collection in one buy. 

They could have updated this version of the game too, still they didn't think it was worth an effort. 

[b] Online Features & DLC's [/b]

This is mostly the negative part along with the point mentioned up on the review. 

As many people know, Ubisoft are turning off some servers, that I believe they act as for a DRM Protection for some of the DLC's and even for some games like ""Assassin's Creed III: Liberation HD"", so since those servers are going offline, people won't be able to touch those anymore starting on September 2022..

It's very unfair for them to do this, since people have bought the content. In some cases, why not make the DLC's free for everyone and just remove the DRM in some-way? There are ways to achieve solutions to the problems they are causing, they just don't care about it, if they did they wouldn't be selling this editions yet, since they're doing that so they can grab more money, before the content is gone forever.



This is why my review has to be negative even for a game that I played a lot in multiple platforms and I even repeated it. I love this game that much, but I can't leave a positive review for a company that doesn't really care about their players. 


I hope there is a way to still stop Ubisoft of doing this. I hope there's a way to turn around things, I suppose we just gotta scream at them together, if something different is to happen, since this is very ""anti-consumer"".

90/100 but thumbs down.  To use an analogy, the food is great, but the restaurant and service is appalling and arrogant, so I'm NOT recommending you give Ubisoft your money.

-20 minutes of unskippable credits if you want to carry on with the open world side after completing the story missions.  

Would you recommend a restaurant that insisted you listen to a 20 minute lecture on who chopped the carrots, who the CFO is, and who cleans the toilets, before you can have your coffee or dessert?  I'm really not interested in who did the Danish localisation of the game, because I didn't play in Danish.

-The Ubisoft Connect launcher forces you to re-enter your password every time you play, and will not remember your password even when you tell it to.  If you already have Ubisoft Connect running *and logged in* before you launch the game from Steam, it simply opens a second session of Ubisoft Connect and asks you for your password (and won't remember it when you tick ""remember my password"").

Would you recommend a restaurant that stopped you and made you show your ID every time you came back from the bathroom to your table?  A restaurant that said ""don't worry, I'll remember you next time"", but then just did the same thing over, and over, again?

-Ubisoft Support is rubbish.  Ubisoft Support told me that “passwords are required to be re-entered for security reasons, and this cannot be bypassed” (see https://steamcommunity.com/app/48190/discussions/1/3201492475340063656/).  But in fact I read some community guides here on Steam, and by running Ubisoft Connect in offline mode, and setting Ubisoft Connect to run as administrator, it now remembers the password, and re-entering it every time *can* be bypassed.

Would you recommend a restaurant where the waiter told you they don’t have your favourite beer or wine and there’s nothing they can do about it, but you found out later, *from the other restaurant patrons*, that the restaurant does in fact have your favourite beer or wine, and it’s very simple to get it?

-Ubisoft Connect is rubbish and Ubisoft Connect error messages are just factually incorrect.  Straight after finishing Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood, I wanted to play the next game in the Assassin’s Creed II trilogy: Assassin’s Creed Revelations.  I bought Assassin’s Creed Revelations at the same time as I bought Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood: some 17 months ago in July 2020.  I tried to launch Assassin’s Creed Revelations from Steam, and got the following error message “Ubisoft Connect         License processing   Dear PseudoNymNZ,  We have received your key for Assassin’s Creed Revelations, however, due to database maintenance it will take a little while to process your license.  We will send you a notification as soon as the key registration has been processed.    You don’t need to do anything else in the meantime – your game will automatically be ready to play as soon as the registration has gone through. ”   

-Ubisoft got my money 17 months ago, why didn’t they activate my licence when they got my money?  My Steam account and Ubisoft account are linked (in fact, the error message from Ubisoft Connect is even personalised to include my Steam id name).

Would you recommend a restaurant that took your booking, and your payment well in advance, for the Mother’s Day buffet extravaganza, and then when you got there, they had made no record of your payment or reservation, and refused to admit you or serve you?

-13 hours later I tried again, and got the exact same error message.  So much for “a little while to process your license”.

Would you recommend a restaurant that told you your food will be here “in a little while”, but 13 hours later the food had still not arrived?  

-I began to suspect that this was a very long time for a database to be down for maintenance.  On a hunch I decided to try changing Ubisoft Connect from offline mode, to online, and tried again.  This time it activated and launched just fine.

What sort of programmers cannot tell the difference between a client side setting (lots of people would change the client side setting from online to offline and back again all the time), and a server side issue (server not responding)?

Would you recommend a restaurant that totally misunderstands the root cause of an issue, and communicates an incorrect message, eg a restaurant that told you “the gas stoves are temporarily not working because we are swapping out the empty gas bottle in the basement –  you don’t need to do anything, your steak will be here in a little while” instead of the true cause eg “our liquor licence only allows us to serve food and beverages at outdoor tables up until 9pm, we need you to relocate to an inside table before we can bring you your food and beverages, or your food is never going to be served”? 

-Thankfully, the free market has a really effective way of punishing businesses who provide a rubbish service to their customers: less sales, and ultimately if bad enough, the business failing.  

-BTW the game itself is great: a really addictive open world game with heaps to do, it has a nicer, slightly brighter colour palette than Assassin’s Creed II, and Brotherhood minimises the (very jarring) swapping in and out of the animus in-game.  There are a few frustrating insta-fail stealth sections, but the combat difficulty is good, allowing you plenty of time to use a vial of medicine to avoid dying. 

- To Ubisoft, no matter how incredible your product or service is, your customers won’t be willing to endure subpar treatment to receive it.  Have a read of eg https://rockcontent.com/blog/bad-customer-service/",1639171557,1657531860,False,12,6,0.51016002893447876,1,True,False,False

The second Ezio story set after Assassins Creed II, the story takes place in Rome. Graphics are a major improvement over ACII, and the controls are a little better to use. I did get some stutter in places but overall it was smooth gameplay.

Some criticisms - Too much focus on side missions, achievements and challenges that the main story gets lost and diluted and hard to follow along. Lots of collecting flags, collecting feathers, collecting treasure chests, races, beat up events, assassination contracts, trailing targets, tombs and crypts, added along with 100% sync challenges, makes the whole game feel a bit of a collectable achievement hunting marathon, rather than the main story being the focus.

I also felt the game didn't have the same atmosphere and character as the previous 2 games, and exploring Rome wasn't as much fun with there being so much area to cover and so many things to do all at once.

But overall, I still enjoyed it, lots and lots to do, and if you liked the previous instalments then this will be right up your street.

It takes everything that made AC2 great, builds and improves upon it and smoothens up its rougher edges.

It therefore pains me that I feel obligated to write a negative review (well, ""review"") for this game simply because of the atrocious behaviour demonstrated by its developer/publisher. As you may have noticed in other reviews or elsewhere, Ubisoft will cancel online support for this game (and several others) as of September 2022. While such step is eventually to be expected with regard to older games, in the case of Brotherhood and other titles, this cancellation will come not only at the usual cost of loss of multiplayer features, but will also mean the loss of access to single-player DLC content, i.e. content that shouldn´t be subject to online connectivity in the first place.

Mind you that in the case of Brotherhood, the said DLCs do not merely comprise of a few cosmetics that people may not even use, but include major gameplay and story content rich in lore and often set in unique locations, such as The Da Vinci Disappearance and the Teplar lairs. Not only will thus future buyers be unable to purchase this content, but, what´s worse, current owners will lose access to it, the very product they had paid money for. In addition to the scammy approach towards players, this decision also demonstrates a disturbing lack of effort on Ubisoft´s part to preserve these games in their complete form for the future. 

The sensible step for Ubisoft (or any publisher really) in such situation would be to remove whatever DRM requirement there might be present for the content in question and make the DLCs permanently part of the base game; or release the games completely DRM-free. As of now however, there are no such signs and it seems that Ubisoft simply does not care about its older games and their players.

If you are as appalled and angered as I am by this behaviour on Ubisoft´s part (and believe me, I am majorly pi**ed off about this), please, do not stay silent. Express your discontent in any way you can and see fit. Write a negative/condemning review, file a complaint with Ubisoft´s support, or - if you have a noticeable presence on social media - make a video/stream on the matter.

[b]UPDATE[/b]  I suspect that Ubisoft shut down the servers mostly for AC: Brotherhood's multiplayer, since they release the Ezio trilogy (which doesn't have ANY multiplayer whatsoever), so go to AC3 or AC4's multiplayer there's a bit of life there.

[b]ANOTHER UPDATE:[/b] Ubisoft will be dropping this game's multiplayer and DLC support on September.

so far, i'm enjoying the game.

edit:  i just finished the campaign and the last chapter felt out of place and kinda confusing story-wise. Yeah, im aware its supposed to be a trilogy, but i'm not talking about ezio and desmond's overall story, i was referring to the antagonist's death.  So anti-climatic.  Gave me the same feeling when i finished starwars kotor2.  It has a great start, but got disappointing in the end.

""The part of second series after Assassin's Creed 2 which depicts Ezio's adventures to avenge his revenge on the Borgia family. Still the same as Assassin's Creed 2 and there are no striking differences in terms of gameplay except for the Assassins Contract system which allows you to create Assassins Brotherhood in Rome, but for the rest such as changes and terms of weapons that you can see in a slightly polished version.

While the story is still ok and this time even Desmond get's something to do, the issues overshadow everything.
Performance is horrid - so many lagspikes in scene transitions. Low and high graphics settings, both have these problems.
UI controls have now changed when compared to AC2 - can't scroll texts using KB, have to use arrows in menus, enter is now needed for ""ok"" and backspace for ""back"" - used to be space and shift.
On the map, can't click on map markers to scroll the map there, have to drag it using mouse but there's a responsivness issue there. Overall the whole UI/Menus left a very bad taste - just why couldn't they reuse what they had in AC2?

The continuation of the story is great in various parts, but is generally lacking when compared to that of AC2's. The unfolding story of Abstergo's history and the comparison between Abstergo and the modern worlds major powers is really great. This information found through the hidden glyphs left by subject 16 are some of the best parts of this game. If only the developers put as much effort into the base game as they did with these :/ For me, the game's enjoyment peaked at both the very beginning and end, whilst generally falling short with only a few patches of great story-gameplay throughout the middle. This resulted from a storyline being hindered by the incredibly monotonous side quests, as well as some of the main quests. You can only do so many fetch and grab, and tail this person for 10 minutes missions before you become completely disengaged from the game.

The amount of glitches and general issues with the game is bad. First thing is the Mouse Acceleration, it's atrocious and the only way to offset it is by setting your X/Y sensitivity to 10 which leads to a bunch of other problems. Second is mission issues, such as the cannon mission at the very start of the game. I had to turn vsync off and cap my fps to 60 to be able to complete it (don't ask me why). Thirdly I wasted an hour of my time trying to access the Collosseum Glyph which ended with me wanting to punch in my monitor. Also as a bonus, why was there no continuation of the creepy yet amazing AC glyphs featuring the Adam and Eve videos of them escaping with the Apple of Eden. Such a missed opportunity. 

I have a strong feeling that this game was intended for console and was then ported over to PC with zero regard for game quality or functionality. Also screw Ubisoft and EA with their awful UPLAY/Origins launchers, I shouldn't have to re-enter my password everytime I want to play this game and I also shouldn't have to use your shitty launcher. The only reason you created these tragic launchers is because you want more money in your wallets at the disregard of player satisfaction and enjoyment for your games. 

In conclusion, despite leaving a negative review if you've played AC2, enjoyed the story and wish to carry it on, then I'd recommend buying Brotherhood on sale. The graphics and the world itself are more vibrant which is great, and the audio specifically the sound effects and voice acting (especially Cesare's) are much better than AC2's. Just stick with the main story line and don't bother with any of the side quests (apart from Christina's side quests they're actually good) and you'll likely enjoy yourself - 7.5/10",1647477319,1656327803,False,4,1,0.475079536437988281,0,True,False,False

1. The game has some very interesting additions that distinguish it from the last entry
2. Not much difference in the graphics department, still pretty good even for today
3. Gameplay is pretty good
4. Only one city to explore but you'll find out that it's enough 
5. Ezio is still great and more experienced as a person
6. Still good writing, intriguing story, deep characters
7.  The missions and side missions are more varied
8. Music is still great

Cons
1. Weird and annoying camera angles at some point when climbing are still there
2. Hidden blade assassination animations where a bit worse than ACII, at least in my version
3. Full sychronization is a bitch. When losing and re-loading from a previous checkpoint the full synchronization options should reset too, instead they remain ""failed"" unless you abort memory and start all-over again. 
4. Be wary that you cannot skip the end credits. If you want to free-roam, you'll have to wait for the end credits to end, and they need 20+ minutes. Did not noticed that in the previous game.
5. Annoying cut-scene skipping controls. You have to press Esc and then choose ""Skip cinematic""
6. Combat is still very simplistic, not challenging at all and you have very little control of how your player battles
7. Since gameplay is more of the same, the little annoying frustrating things came to be a lot more annoying than in AC II. For example 
a.) not a lot of consistency in stealth missions, in terms of when people are able to detect you. Also people detect you in situations that seem illogical 
b.) the timer when you follow someone it's not very logical. You should at least have the chance to search for the person you follow a bit more if you lose it.
c.)  Sometimes the character responds differently than you want it to and makes everything more frustrating, especially when there is stealth or timers involved
7.) Some glitches in my version, such as the enemy going and staying inside a memory area that I'm not synchronized with.


Summary
The pros out-weigh the cons quality-wise. Reason being, the graphics, characters, setting and story is great and the gameplay is good enough even if its not perfect. 
The flaws are somehow logical because this game attempts to be a bit more complex than the previous, so because of its additions I think it's at least on par with the previous game. Many people choose either this game or ACII as the best of the whole series.",1648306368,1653498589,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I know I didn't. But here I am. On one side are the Templars, better known these days as Abstergo Industries. They're in the business of control. Politics. Economics. Technology. They won't stop until every single one of us serves them. Literally. Fighting against them are the Assassins. A group dedicated to safeguarding humanity's free will. I was born into the Brotherhood. A couple of weeks ago the Templars found me. They took me prisoner. Strapped me into a machine they'd built and put me to work. It's called an Animus. And it's where I spend most of my time. Exploring the memories of my ancestors, discovering entire lives locked deep inside my DNA. First, I revisited the life of Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad, an Assassin from the Crusades. The Templars wanted the location of something known as a Piece of Eden. An ancient artefact capable of bending people to their will. Once the Templars had what they were looking for, they decided my usefulness had come to an end. But Lucy saved me. Lucy. When things were at their worst, she revealed herself to be an Assassin and helped me escape. I was hoping that would be the end of my misadventures. But we were just getting started. Back into another Animus I went. Now I'm reliving the memories of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, my ancestor from the Renaissance, searching for a path forward. Through the Bleeding Effect, I'm becoming an Assassin in more than just name. It will come in handy, as the Templars prepare to enslave us all. They've found us. They've crashed our hideout and we're fleeing the scene, looking for a place to hide. Only there isn't any and time is running short. My name is Desmond Miles and this is my story.""

If you enjoyed AC2, you're going to love AC: Brotherhood. The story picks up exactly where the previous game left off, as is tradition, both in the present day story and inside the Animus simulation with Ezio, and things start to get serious. After a fight with Abstergo, Desmond, Lucy, Rebecca and Shaun pack up and leave to what they deem the safest possible hideout where no one would think / dare to look. Modern day Monteriggioni, previously the Italian Assassin headquarters where Ezio lived and trained with his uncle in AC2. A modest Masyaf, if you will, which these days serves as a sort of tourist location in real life. 

It's a race against time. To find the Apple of Eden before Abstergo does and takes control of the world, and figure out a way to save the world from the Dec. 21st, 2012 solar flare catastrophe. So after some present day conversations, parkour sequences and general banter, back into the Animus you go to explore the life of Ezio once again. The historical part of the game expands greatly on the mechanics of AC2, in every way. 

The combat is super smooth with a new counter-kill mechanic, the tools and gadgets are more satisfying than ever including parachutes, and Ezio genuinely feels like a powerhouse. A true power fantasy! 

The game is called Brotherhood because Ezio starts to realise just how desperate the Templars are and the lengths they will go to in order to achieve their goals, so Ezio begins recruiting an army of Assassins for the liberation of Rome, where the entire game takes place this time. The Assassins can be sent on missions which earns them XP and gives you rewards. They can be called in the middle of battle or to quietly dispatch a group of targets for you, leaving you unnoticed. The way the game's story is structured, it's almost as if AC: Brotherhood was supposed to be an end DLC for AC2, which would have made AC2 a gigantic, single game. But of course, it's its own game, and that's good because it vastly improved upon everything AC2 did. 

You meet many familiar faces from the previous game during your travels, and the side content is better than ever, especially the War Machines missions. Ezio is a little older, wiser and because of that, deadlier than ever. The plan is to eliminate the Borgia family for good, especially madman military commander Cesare Borgia, who wants the Apple of Eden for himself. With the help of thieves, mercenaries, courtesans, Niccolò Machiavelli, Bartolomeo d'Alviano, La Volpe, Caterina Sforza, Leonardo da Vinci and even Ezio's mother and sister, who now joins the cause, Ezio will become not only Master Assassin, but Mentor of the Brotherhood in Roma. Well deserved! ;)

And let me just say... the soundtrack is absolutely kickass! Jesper Kyd did it again :)

The epic story ends with the Borgia threat over and Ezio leaving the Apple of Eden where none may find it. Except Desmond, far in the future, as foretold by the First Civilisation. Ezio being only the messenger across time. So Desmond and crew go to the Colosseum in Rome, where the POE is hidden as seen in the Animus, to retrieve it. And retrieve it they do, after speaking with the First Civ and hearing more of their philosophical ways... Let's just say the game ends on a big cliffhanger that no one expected, as Desmond loses control of himself for a few seconds after acquiring the Apple. 

Which is the perfect setup for the next game.",1652483963,1652484145,True,6,0,0.569912135601043701,0,True,False,False

Same is true for game mechanics and style. We have an action game packed with unlocks and linear progress. Optional side quests and challanges that rewards players with better equipment, more health, utility and such. We follow the story of war between Assassins and Templars, some Extinction Level Threat and shrouded predecessors with mystery motives also available for spicing up the game. Played at 2022, finished with full sync, all secrets, flags, etc. 

++ Story: Although hidden behind many optional text, paintings, secret quests and many location info, it is good. Not too deep but ties with real world, real people, conspiracies makes it believable. Criticism about world order, religions, politics are weaved well into the game and makes you wonder while you poison people or thrust spears into their eyes. Philosophy in action. 

-+ Controls: Still playing with keyboard&mouse and although it's my third game, there are still moments Ezio does not go where I want. Very annoying camera/button shifting in special dungeons is still there but not very common. I know I have a way up in case I fall but, still  cazzo. 
 
++ Gameplay: Combat is again fun and  have more options. Poison / Crossbow and your Assasins are over-powered. If you are after %100 Sync, extra challenges are quite good most of the time, and quite annoying rest of the time. That over powered stuff mentioned, balances out that annoyance so they are OK. Animations are nice to watch, when you chain your skills and use everything at your arsenal it is quite fun to take large odds. Explore every wepon, its special attack and its counters. Watch guards kill each other with poison, grab hammers and bash some skulls, order some mercenaries to beat soldiers, mingle with courtesans while bloodshed going on. 

A new feature added in AC:Brotherhood is your own Assasins Guild. You can call them to help or send them to missions. Missions grant you items and money. Though money is -again- not an issue. If you just upgrade the city and level up your assassins beforehand (side quests first kind of play) they will make many hard mission easy, many %100 sync piece of cake. Use them. Level 10 assassino paying respects to dead (to whom it just killed) is fun to watch. 

You can still kill everyone and got forgotten by killing the witness or removing posters. Secrets, flags, guild challanges all reward you with meaningful items. They also provide context, lore and more action so i suggest a full playthrough like i did. So it's better of the same. 

++Technical: Aside from some levels having problems with high refresh rate, no bugs or crashes happened. Change processor affinity after you launch the game (disable cpu 0 -press ok - reenable all) , drop refresh to 60Hz on some missions or just all the time and you are good to go. 21:9 works, you can add antialiasing etc if your system is powerful from your video driver.

Эта игра - загадка, триллер, хоррор, мистика в эталонной обертке. Невозможно описать эту игру одним словом, есть лишь довод - это невероятный проект!

Я как перфекционист и любитель минимализма выделю в первую очередь дизайн, антураж, графику игры. Это экстаз для глаз! Перевернутые комнаты, офисные лабиринты, двойные миры, глубокие пещеры, все это придано в мистическом тихом минимализме, этот мир как отдельное искусство. Вы можете играться с источниками света(поглощать тьму), разрушать все окружение, с помощью телекинеза швырять все вокруг, окружение ваш друг и ваш враг, если не учесть физику, то можно задеть и себя. В графическом исполнении эту игру можно отнести к рассвету нового поколения, с включенной трассировкой лучей погружение куда глубже, отражение в игре играет огромную роль, это не просто роскошь, но и изюминка дополненного геймплея, вы побываете в зеркальном лабиринте.

Геймплей игры истекает из названия, полный контроль над своим телом и разумом, кинематографичная боевая система и психологическое безумие всего окружения, но при всем этом могуществе вам не дадут спокойно стоять на месте и швырять все вокруг, игра крайне энергична, каждая схватка как новый ход в сочетании видов разброса оружия и применения сил.

Можно еще выделить саундтреки сводящие мурашки по коже, настольжи по комнатным играм, где в каждой комнате скрыты свои секреты и тайны, здесь много потайных комнат, секретов, лора. Сюжет хоть и желает лучшего, но чтоб вникнуть в происходящее вам надо будет читать записки, смотреть документации.

It's accurate depiction of the time period is set in, the fun combat, and enticing story make for a wonderful, compelling experience. 

I personally had high hopes for the game, eagerly buying it on a sale, and I even caught myself tapping my foot with impatience waiting for it to download. I simply could not wait to leap into this amazing, immersive world.

The usual thoughts filled the back of my head, but I pushed them aside. I knew things were going to be different. I just had a feeling that for once, I would be able to kick back, and enjoy a wonderful story-driven game.

After it downloaded, I quickly set up Uplay, the ubisoft application required to play this game. After doing this, I started the game up, got familiar with the characters, and sat down to play the first segment of the game.

The loading screens in this game place your character into a white abyss, which makes sense, as part of the story is that you are re-living memories, and the white abyss is the supercomputer initialising the synthetic world around you.

Nothing usually happens in these screens. You're able to walk around, swing your sword, and that's usually about all you can do before the game loads. Now, having a SSD installed in my computer, I wasn't expecting to be loading for very long.

But for some strange reason, the game would not loading, leaving me trapped in this endless void. Bored, I stared into the white abyss, seeing if I could make out anything. It was there I saw him once again, stalking me like some sort of hungry phantom.

I Immediately pressed Alt-F4, and the game closed. I was safe. I had beaten him. I had beaten the monkey. Finally.

That was what I was thinking till the game re-opened itself, and I watched in complete silence and fear as I was fucked by a monkey. All I had done by closing the game was give him a free opportunity to grab me. I made it easy for him. I am ashamed.

I can't even load into games anymore. I cannot even reach the gameplay segment before he shows up. I need help. He needs to be stopped. Is anybody reading these? Is anyone even listening? Please help me. He'll return shortly.

* Awesome game overall.
* Good storyline. The Desmond storyline progresses little but dramatically. The Ezio storyline is awesome.
* Beautiful graphics for the time, but a somewhat short draw distance compared to current games.
* Somewhat buggy, camera angles sometimes a bit annoying when controlling with mouse, game hangs after Alt-Tabbing.
* The stealth part is much lighter than games like Hitman. For 100% you sometimes need no kills with no detection and never more than a combination of no detection and one other requirement.

Tips for players
* Take your time to read new database entries about buildings and people; they're quite amusing
* Do a bit of virtual training to improve your parkour and fighting skills. It's well worth it.
* If you've played previous AC games: you're now able to get maps of all collectibles.
* Buy as much shops as you can and eventually your income will spiral
* If you go for 100% sync and you;'re stuck at the tank mission: : at the end of the mission, drive through the border behind the doors. The two other tanks can't shoot you.

I'm not sure whether this one is better than its predecessor or not. In some ways it continues to improve upon the formula set by the previous two entries. Combat is fun, animations are stylish. New mechanics like the brotherhood itself are really fun to mess around with. Missions feel more unique, offering a larger variety of things to do. The story feels like a good follow up to ACII, for the most part. 

That said, for everything I like more in Brotherhood, there is also something I like less. Combat is too easy. Slicing through enemies like a badass is definitely entertaining, especially with the updated finisher animations, however it does begin to get old. The fact that every enemy can be killed in one attack means that you don't feel the need to buy new weapons, which is a shame since this was quite fun in ACII. The parkour also feels more clunky again here too. I'm not sure what it is, since it seems mostly the same, but something is just wrong. It feels like the hitboxes are slightly off, and this causes Ezio to grab the wrong things every so often. 

Though the biggest offender for me is by far the story. While formulaic, it is solid for the first two acts of the game. Even most the third act at that. But the ending fumbles so bad. No spoilers, but some plotlines begin to feel unnecessary. Some reveals are unsatisfying. And to top it all off, just as you get to what feels like the end- the game strings you along a line of very short quests that feel like filler and break the flow completely. The ending in the present day storyline is also laughably bad. 

Now I do hope this doesn't sound too negative, because I do like a lot of the game apart from this. There's just not too much to bring up regarding it since it is mostly polished versions of features already present in ACII. 

I'll give AC:B an 8/10. If I was judging it on improvements alone, It would certainly rank higher than ACII, but I also have to take into account the downsides. This evens the two games out, so I have to give them the same score.",1649541217,1649541217,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay of brotherhood is way better than the second game as the combat is fast and you can do kill streak, the inventory is much faster to pull up and you can also now put shortcuts.

Later in the game you can recruit, call and send your assassins to missions.

As you liberate the city of Rome, you renovate buildings to improve your income the same as how you did in the previous game as well, you can also provide investments to other shops as they can give you more money and when you invest the same shop, you are rewarded with trade items.

The story, the characters, it's a direct continuation. Well, actually I like AC 1 as well, but as far as story you need to play 2 before Brotherhood.

But that said, all the additions to the game (recruits, having Assassin's you can call upon, etc) are great. Pretty much a straight upgrade from 2 in that respect.
On the downside, you only get 1 city to explore, Rome, as opposed to the multiple cities of the previous two games in the series. But this is actually less of a downside than one might expect, because Rome is a really great city. It's big enough without ever being too big, and the large ""countryside"" area breaks up what could have been a too-samey map.

It's a fun game. If you've played 2 and enjoyed it, this is kind of more of the same, but done very well. I look forward to continuing the series.

My time is a bit inflated by having to pause and deal with things IRL, so I'd knock a couple hours off. But I also achieved a pretty high completion, without collecting all 101 of the collectable flags, or getting all the treasures (though I got over half of the flags adn over 75% of the treasures).",1648811378,1648811378,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I particularly enjoy the economic aspects of the game, removing Borgia influence, opening up shops, etc. The parkour (I prefer the French spelling parcours, but what can you do?) opportunities, especially the Romulus and Templar opportunities are very entertaining and - the first time through at least - sometimes positively bewildering. It isn't always obvious where to start any particular stage of the route. Occasionally it gets difficult using PC and mouse because you have to jump at an angle and can't always turn in the right direction, but there are no problems that are unsolvable even on PC.

One of the best parts of the game is building up a group of assassins (and being able to call on them to help on most missions too). Unfortunately, Ubisoft has never, in all its subsequent games, used this mechanic again. The nearest to it is Valhalla, when you have access to the ship's crew for certain things and support from an army and other NPCs in various missions.

There are things I don't like though:

1. The men with the boxes. Unless you walk with the shift button down, these guys will make a beeline for you, bump into you, and drop their boxes and everyone will be 'appalled', and any nearby soldiers are prepared to kill you for it. This was even worse in AC 2.

2. The minstrels/troubadours (I hesitate to call them musicians as none of them seem either able to sing or play the lute) stand in your way and sing at you. I have had as many as four on many occasions. I just run when I see them. Another hangover from AC 2. Mildly amusing the first time, they become irritating after a while.

3. Cardinals crossing the bridge to the Vatican area. The bridge is guarded. You can cross safely by crossing with a group. The number of groups that seem to walk halfway across the bridge and turn round halfway is quite astonishing and utterly unrealistic. No-one would do that. Ever.

4. The blacksmiths are very rude and frequently make scathing comments. It seems to be all of them. Only visit a blacksmith when you require ammunition, require new equipment, or a repair - unless, of course, you enjoy being pointlessly insulted. I would like to say that it was unrealistic for a shopkeeper to do that, but having experienced it in the real world too many times, it clearly isn't.",1647459651,1647459651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story felt bland the graphics were great the game play just felt to easy the characters just looked overly depressing and the only good part I could say was near the ending but I'm just really lost overall I give the game a 3/10 just wish It was a little longer and the story didn't feel to blandish.

My scores for this game
Story : 10/10
The continuation of the story is AC II and it starts very well from where we left off. It was very enjoyable and great both in the present and in the time of desmond.
Graphics : 9/10
The game graphics were good and had more improvements than the previous version, but still the shadows were the same as the previous version.
Musics & Sound : 10/10
Again, Ezio spoke in an Italian accent, which was a problem for him and he had a lot of good songs. One of the songs was less than the previous version, but it was exaggerated.
Details : 10/10
The texture of the city of Rome was one of the details and beauties of the game that was carefully designed.
Game Play : 10/10
If you are looking for a real assassin creed, be sure to play this game.
Variety : 10/10
Winning more sub-missions and being more versatile and even non-repetitive was great, more than any of Leonardo's inventions that added to the variety of the game.
Characterization : 10/10
In this version that I bought, Leonardo had good clothes and appearance, and also the appearance of people is better than AC II.
Optimization : 9/10
The game was very good, only this ubisoft connect that one of my friends was online, I was eating a log and the problem was completely from the launcher.
Multiplayer : 7/10 
I tried to connect to the online part of the game, which asked me to uplay, which should remind ubisoft that there is no uplay 🤦 In short, I connected with a general problem and saw that there is no player.
Bugs : It had a lot of game bugs, especially in one or two parts, I went underground and it was awful.  And I checked that these bugs have not been seen by most of my friends, and in further investigation, I found out that the altair dress given to me by the deluxe edition has bugs.
Note : need connect ubisoftconnect.
Description : After the end of AC II, when it was finished in a bad place, I immediately bought and downloaded AC BH, and when I started the game, I was very happy until the part where the castle was attacked and the game started, and until I finished the game, I was very upset and  Again, the story of the game ended in a bad place and I quickly downloaded AC REVLATION, which is a very good experience to continue, thanks ubisoft.

Don't be discouraged by the frustratingly pointless, cinematic-heavy introduction, because everything after that is compelling. I couldn't stay mad at the game for long, not after nimbly scaling Rome's famous Coliseum and flicking my blade into the necks of three hapless gunmen, all entirely undetected. Brotherhood's massive and complex open world is an engrossing, blood-soaked playground.

Brotherhood picks up where Assassin's Creed II left off, with late-fifteenth-century master assassin Ezio having just defeated a sickeningly corrupt pope. He returns home safely, but is inexplicably surprised the next day when the pope's son interrupts his awkwardly animated sex scene with an army. Cue the awful cannons!

After a tedious segment outside of the Animus (a sci-fi device through which the series' true protagonist relives his assassin ancestors' memories), Ezio travels to Rome to dislodge the tyrannical establishment. It's here that the open-world game starts for real, and the plot congeals.

As in AC2, the story progresses through a series of Ezio's memories. The missions are varied sequences of stealth, combat, and story-driving dialog, and even the seemingly garden-variety escort missions are well done. It's hard to be bored while leaping across rooftops with knives.

The free-running and combat do take effort to master. Early in the game I was tasked with chasing down and tackling a pickpocket, so I sprinted into a crowd, fell over, jumped into a pile of hay, and stuck my hidden blade through the throat of a woman carrying her groceries. The more I played, though, the more impressive (and less unintentionally amusing) my acrobatics became. They'd have been a little more impressive, though, without the game's few irksome graphical glitches, like pop-ins that once warped a hostile guard directly in front of me while I was being sneaky.

Aside from the story missions, Brotherhood builds on AC2's huge list of optional things to do: violently taking over enemy territory, recruiting and managing ally assassins, investing in property. I got happily lost in its time-sink vortex for hours, and more hours still were spent amusing myself by free-running through Rome and beating up guards for no reason. The single-player offers at least 15 hours of quality assassinatin'.

I am 69.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1645169435,1645169435,True,43,10,0.629567742347717285,0,True,False,False

yea the story is nothing near as AC1-2, in fact you can watch the ending on youtube and go for next game.
for gameplay, it's double variety/elements compared to 2 which had triple more from first game in the series,
so yea, it's a game completely FILLED with gameplay mechanisms that can amuse you for over 100 hours if you're willing.

Brotherhood comes very challenging game at 100% completion
harder than any other ac game at least by my playthrough
Assassins creed 3 may seem a lot harder than this but there is adequate checkpoints in ac3
in brotherhood missions like tank and bomber and a little bunch of other quests
make your head explode so that's why is hardest

There is not much to the story in this part
fuckin ubisoft made short 9 sequence plot
and it's very short like a big dlc but a lot of side missions and first 100% sync in missions which some of them of course not without bugs and obvious stupidity like tank hard as shit and bomber and etc of more bullshit
although many good things like assassin recruits, rebuilding rome
better graphics, lighter fight system, difficulty comes with other objectives now
so with fight you can relax it's easy and recruits can take over for ya
i would so much like to say what this is the best ac game but i can't
clearly plot came out of lazy ubi writer's ass
it's not bad it's just very short and very lazy when it come to the end
and obviously game plot with 9 sequence it's ridiculous to call it a full game
that's why there is so many side missions collectables,100% sync
endless rebuilding so you can stay and play it as legit full game
but it's not it's good but this sucks but it's not so bad
for example ac rogue way a lot worse by quality than this one
brotherhood one of my favorites and i've done it 100% 3 times
full achievements challenges shit and all
and at 100% gameplay it's really rewarding and i like this game not like any other ac game
and i recommend play this only take a few tips don't rush it to the 100%
it can be very rage sometimes
and when you start playing it and get to rome atmosphere in this may seem not friendly and boring cause you will need to buy a handful of stupid ass shops and rebuild, buy, adapt to the new harsh environment made by ubisoft so you can rebuild yourself from zero after nicest calm florence, destroyed monteriggioni and death of uncle mario
but this will get better and tiring at the same time
just get through with it don't try complete all at the same time
get one thing at the time and avoid rage from unluck of getting 100% sync
and don't sell your ""trade objects"" you may need it for the shop quests
My opinion this game made not only for the plot
But at 100% gameplay only so if you didn't get very far you just don't get it
Play unity or some shit lol

Don't forget assassins creed titles should be played in chronological order only
If you playing it other way i have a bad news for you

Very good improvement upon the second installment, combat is fluid, and kill chain is perfect addition.
Soundtracks very nice, along with recycled ones, but nothing that is new is much memorable. Story is SUPERB!

PC version here has some game breaking bugs that were not fixed, along with Leonardos war machines. Fly machine in particular. A had to install FPS capper app because 100% synchronization was impossible for that mission. I couldn't turn the machine left or right. Very frustrating, but if you cap it at 60 FPS it is doable. One bug has really disappointed me, I could not face the main villain on the walls, because he was stucked at perpetual combat with NPC's and I could move through them like ghost, had to restart the game (Which I did fairly often in my playthough)
This game has not left me with emotional impact as AC2 did, but it is still very good, and must but IMO.

8.5/10

Now, I know the Synchronization Challenges are Optional, but how they are put into action, a lot of them I failed because it asks too much of one person.  

Stay undetected missions, I did not enjoy these, very frustrating with several guards all over the place.  I failed multiple times because I would just get caught without warning, or the detection meter would cheat and get me caught on purpose.

Now the reason I could not finish is because I was towards the end of the game, now I had bought cheap armor and 3 pieces broke, leaving me with little health.  I had the apple of eden, but it drains your health so fast, and you have to kill a lot of guards with it, but having little health, I would just be stuck regaining more health, but I could not finish because one guard got out of bounds through the barrier, and he was stuck running in place.

First time i played it was on a fat ps3 on a really bad tv ( i think it only outputted 480p ) and i enjoyed every minuted of this game.

They really outdid themselves with how they portrayed the characters and made Ezio even more likable. There are so many memorable moments in this game it's worth taking it slow.

I really didn't like that they only had Roma as a playable map, but it was bigger than the maps from the previous game so i guess it was worth it but got boring fast.

I liked that there were the same or more weapons than the first game, the armor upgrades were ok just like the first Ezio game. What i didn't like was the 'end game' brutus armor. It was weaker than the maximum upgrade normal armor and it looked really bad. They really missed the mark with this one.

The first thing you will notice about ACB is the very clear leap in graphics from AC2. Honestly its astounding to jump from AC2 to ACB and look how much they improved in the graphics/visuals department.

Next, the openworld of ACB imo is much better than AC2. AC2's standouts were undoubtedly Venice and Florence but all the other places like Forli and Tuscana were pretty unimpressive and underwhelming to me atleast. ACB's Rome is gorgeous, beautifully designed and the surrounding countryside area is also very well detailed(unlike AC2's countryside). ACB's openworld is also filled with much better sidequests to do than what was available in AC2. The sidequests are clearly a standout feature of ACB unlike AC2's super generic sidequests. 

The ost is just as good as AC2 and quite similar as well. The music fits really well with the environments and tracks like 'City of Rome' does wonders for the immersion.

The gameplay is undoubtedly an improvement from AC2. The combat is much smoother, stylish and cool to look at. The game makes Ezio feel like a completely unstoppable ninja badass and you can command your own assassins to attack/assassinate targets or enemies. There is also chain kills that contributes to making the combat look super stylish and Ezio a killing machine. However, all this comes at the expense of making the game extremely easy. Imo, the gratification of the cool as shit combat animations and the power fantasy of being a master ninja/assassin outweighs the demerits of the easy combat. The game simply knows how to create the perfect power fantasy of being an assassin god and is very good at it.

The story so far is kinda similar to AC2 but that doesn't make it not entertaining. The feeling of trying to liberate an important historical city like Rome from cunts like the Borgias is pretty satisfying. The villains so far haven't been complex or anything but all told the story is entertaining.

In conclusion, definitely recommend this game.",1641707161,1641707161,True,7,0,0.598812222480773926,0,True,False,False

Given this ones entirely base in Rome was a bit of a let down as there was hardly any travelling. 
It does give some answers to missing parts in AC2's story though.
I found all shops being closed to begin with somewhat out of place, no real reason all shops are closed.
The Romulus stuff in place of the seals for Altiar's armour, 0 story to it, It was just a thing that was there to fill time.
Graphically same as AC2, a tad better if anything
The ongoing story was kind of meh and nothing really happened, couple of guys died a couple needed to die and in between was sort of fill in.

Its an OK game but nothing to boast about. However if playing for the Ezio trilogy (arguably the best story) absolutely worth it.

At this point I have not finished revelations yet, We shall see how this trilogy ties off yet.

The upsides:
- The combat was exciting and extremely satisfying.
- Graphics hold up decently well considering the game was made more than a decade ago.
- You can continue to play the game and upgrade your town even after the main story line is over (the world is full of side quests and things to buy)
- The voice acting was also really good and they even included bits of the Italian language into there which was a nice touch.

The downsides:
- Absolute garbage controls and UI for PC. Its so obvious that the game was made for console but they could have at least put in SOME effort for the PC port. If you aren't used to the AC genre, then you're going to have a tough time getting used to the controls.
- The game does this thing where it makes it seem like you have a bunch of different ways to complete a quest but in reality, there is only 1 true way to reach your objective (making the game very linear). A super generic example of this is like climbing a tower. There are a bunch of windows and ledges you can latch onto, but there is only ever 1 proper way to fully reach the top (I wont go into details for missions since that would be spoiler territory). Very few missions give proper freedom to the player in how to complete it. If you can look past this, the gameplay is still fun.

But thats honestly the only real downsides. 

TLDR;
I really liked the game. Pick it up when it goes on sale & live your best assassin life.

The combat is similar to previous titles but with improved offensive options and new gadgets just make the game more fun. One new mechanic that involves rebuilding and upgrading your own army of Assassins to recruit for the brotherhood is one of the most satisfying aspects of the game. Just wait until you get to try it out. All of these new additions to the game design make for improved stealth and other gameplay elements. Instead of multiple cities with large expanses of land in between like AC1 and 2, now the game takes place mainly in one huge city with its own countryside. This made exploring the world a true pleasure, and the visuals, which look better than any previous title in the series, make the environments and the characters dwelling in them really pop. The economic system from the second title returns with minor improvements to accessibility. More ranged options helped a ton in stealth sequences. Side missions feel more thought-out and better designed, and some feature solid story sequences. The main story of the game itself is presented more cinematically and dramatically, however overall I didn't think the story was as engaging or mysterious as the second game. The villain is much bette I think and overall the story that's there is solid and well-told, if not as mind-blowing as AC2. Modern day segments have improved slightly over AC2 as well. There is more interesting dialogue and some major story beats in these palate cleansers. Of course you'd still rather be in the animus with all your cool upgrades and gadgets. Ultimately, if you enjoyed Assassin's Creed II, you will very likely appreciate this game even more for its improvements in nearly all aspects of the design.

Technically the third in the Assassin's Creed series, this expands even more the realm of the assassin including forming and recruiting for an assassin guild (single player mode). If you love stealing from the poor, you should probably be a politician, if you love murdering guards and politicians, you should probably be locked behind bars, if you love doing both then this game is for you.

Tell you what, If you want an Assassin's Creed game that engages you not only by its story, but more then it is for you. It gives you the utmost experience at a place like Rome and rule it against all odds as a renowned master assassin with your brotherhood. Now let me share my thoughts about it in very few options.


[i]10.0/10.0, Never fails to make me wander around the Colosseum[/i]


[h1]Story[/h1]
Certainly, it continues to explore the further life of a charismatic, master assassin, Ezio Auditore alongside bringing new characters and opportunities. By what I mean to say is, I had a league of my own, a brotherhood that brought an exact image of how a creed establishes and develops. With all that, I had a stacked quest to overcome and that is where I found the story quite engaging. Every bit of it went up to took its place perfectly and set the narrative of the whole story beautifully.


[h1]Visuals and more[/h1]
Visuals are good and decent as it was developed an almost decade ago. You will get what you're expecting. In addition to that, the characters, facial, movement animations are quite smooth and delivering. Also, I spent some moments at Pantheon and Colosseum, they were my place to explore and take a breath as they were seemingly beautiful.


[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
Definitely, this has some of the fascinating background scores like Echoes of Roman Ruins. Makes you feel like you've gone back to the ages of Romans. Besides, all the other scores are perfect as well, proper enough to suit the theme and set the tone.


[h1]Performance and Issues[/h1]
I happen to use a very low-end configuration for a while now. But since it hardly demands more than I can give it, so I usually get kind of smooth, playable performance at a moderate setting. As for the other issues, I haven't encountered any crashes or anything else, so it's all good enough to me.


So, that is it to say for now, but it's indescribable to say how special it is to me. Even after an almost decade, I had the same enthusiasm while completely every bit of it.",1638360703,1638365148,True,2,0,0.540636062622070313,0,True,False,False

Don't sell these items, or you'll be running around trying to find some g-dang Buddhist Prayer Beads and Tomatoes for like an hour, just to unlock some dumb crap at whichever dumb vendor... Once you get to Ch. 8 or 9, where you're going after Cesare and Rodrigo, then you can sell all the junk...

Easily the most annoying AC game in the series so far, and the Rome setting and storyline kinda drags on and gets a bit boring after a while... But there are some things that make up for it; like being able to call in a horde of Assassins to wreck the guard who thought he was hot shit enough to shove you for getting too close....

The combat rules are completely different now; to block incoming attacks, you gotta have a heavy weapon. Otherwise, you can deflect small swords and daggers, but the dudes with anything heavier (maces, war hammers, axes, longswords, spears, polearms, basically 2/3 of the guards you'll face), will just hack you to bits.

The armor doesn't start unlocking until well into the game (I think Ch. 5 or 6), and then most of it unlocks right away... Dunno why, but they stick you with a small amount of junk armor for like half the game, then it feels like the devs finally remembered that better armor exists and needs to be unlocked. It really sucks when your entire pack of followers are better armed/armored than you are....

And I've completely given up on chasing theives and Borgia boys; unless they come waltzing up bumping right into my horse or myself to the point where I just smash the ""tackle"" button, it's totally not worth it to chase them; Ezio is totally going to throw himself off the building in a largely random direction, screwing your chase up completely.... This also happens a lot in quests where you have to chase down the target; DON'T lock onto them, or you're destined to throw yourself in random directions....

And speaking of which, the platforming in certain areas (especially Lair of Romulus levels) is made artificially more difficult by the use of locking the camera angles at stupid angles... I wish I could smack upside the head whoever thought that was a good idea, because it's frustrating as hell when your character leaps to his death because the camera angle is off and there's no way to move it.

Worth it for the storyline continuation from AC2, but if you're doing a quick playthrough, it might be prudent just to make all the assumptions about the storyline and then skip ahead to AC:Rev...",1637759345,1637759345,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS
- Graphics have been refined further, scenery look mostly same especially on areas that are similar (genereic buildings, countryside) with ACII. 
- Jesper Kyd's soundtrack. Loved it. 
- Horses are more nimble and you can mow through crowds without falling over and angering guards. For some reason you can also buy stables which are not part of economics. Don't know why, as you can whistle your horse to fetch you like Batmobile in Arkham Knight. 
- Economics have been made more detailed, but still just delay on making Ezio superrich and florines trivial. There are still treasure collectibles but why would you want to spend time with time with collecting few hundred coins when you have hundred thousand in your purse. 
- Most of collectibles are on treasure maps, even feathers. Thank God there are just ten feathers. 
- More combat options - Crossbow and parachutes for times when you can't just bothered to close in stabbing or find haystack to jump in. 
- Kill Streaks and calling in your recruits when you don't want to spend time with mooks or just messing with guard who is stabbing at haystack to find out if anyone is hiding there and seeing how assassin jumps out of there and slaughters whole squad. Never gets old. 
- Templar lairs forced perspectives are not that bad as they were in ACII. Don't like them but can live with them. At least don't have to guess so much what button makes Ezio jump to which direction anymore. No timed switches either. Good riddance to them. 

CONS
- Very little interaction with Ezio's family and even less with recruited assassins, having just couple comments comments. Would've wanted to have Ezio teaching them at least some basics on couple missions. 
- Shops have few quests which are just bringing them set of more or less randomly generated trade items, which could've lived without as well as whole trade item idea. There is also chance to invest to shops, which I believed was some kind of online feature which is now closed, being just way to get more trade items. 
- Missions have additional goals for Full Sync making 100% completion even more tedious. Most of them are manageable, but now and then comes up total gamestopper in form of time limit, or no hits requirement on later stage of long mission. In some cases, desyncin won't save you and you'd need to start anew. You can miss several of them without missing content though. 
- Even though you can send recruits to missions from London to Calicut they feel just pointless idle rpg type exp generators. There are missions which  have arc and more description but even they seem to repeat. Would've wanted to see if your missions even make difference. 
- Around this time Ubisoft started to go nuts with plot and you'd need to follow different medias to get whole picture of the plot.

The story vice the game is a bit boring, as the story feels a bit forced and rushed, but the highlight of the game; is how Ubisoft improved upon its predecessor with the introduction of new features.

The other thing I liked very much; was the fact that looting in this game is much more practical; I barely visited the smith for ammunitions and always got what I needed by looting the dead NPC's.

The one thing; I was disappointed about was that the game now only focuses on a single city rather than having us travel to various cities like in the previous games. The other thing, as I stated before was that the storyline feels a bit forced and makes you think like the developers just wanted to complete the game as quickly as possible.

All in all, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a great game, and you should consider buying it if you like to play Ezio Auditore a bit more.",1637426201,1637426493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Instead of spreading the game out over multiple maps, ACBH opts for a single map in the form of a recreation of Rome at the turn of the 16th century, and works out incredibly well. The city/landscapes look excellent and period appropriate, with many accurate representations of ancient and Renaissance era structures for which Rome is famous. Even the interior locations, especially the churches, are a sight to behold. Fast travel is facilitated  through unlockable travel points and horseback riding, making getting where you need to go mostly hassle free. There's less overall area to explore in comparison to AC2, but what's here is very dense with things to see and do.

- ACBH provides the player with tons of varying side activities to engage in. These include expanding your influence by burning down Borgia towers, exploring parkour puzzles in tombs and temples, foot races, assassination challenges, purchasing shops and landmarks, collectible hunting, and the list goes on. Not only is there always something to do, but the rewards for completing them always feel like you're making progress no matter how short your play session is. This is where most of the fun is and you'll end up wanting to 100% the game even if you initially hadn't intended to do so.

- Combat has been further altered to be even faster and flashier with the addition of quick executions after an initial kill. Enemies now use ranged weaponry more frequently, making encounters with mixed units a more tactical affair than simply waiting to counterattack. You'll be switching weapons and moving around a lot more often than you did in AC2.

- Though a bit under cooked, the system involving recruiting and utilizing your own group of assassins is a very welcome addition. It's incredibly satisfying to have a target in your sights from 50 yards away, snapping your fingers, and seeing your assassins appear in a puff of smoke to go in for the kill like your own personal ninja death squad. The global economic system is also a nice touch, though it too is underutilized.


The Bad:

- The main missions and storyline are completely forgettable. The tale of Ezio's rise to becoming leader of the Assassins is a surprisingly dull one, with no real twists, revenge once again being the motivating factor, and another mustache twirler being the only villain of any real importance. Almost nothing of consequence happens until the very end and that occurs in the present day storyline, one that has become so sci-fi silly that you probably don't care about it anymore. If you were to ignore all of the side content and bonus objectives, you could easily complete the main missions in 8-10 hours, really hammering home that the real game here is achieving 100% completion.

- The story of Abstergo during the 1900s, told through the glyph puzzles, comes off as commie gobbledygook written by Starbucks Marxists. The Templars/Abstergo are irredeemably evil Scooby Doo villains who constantly say their goal is to protect humanity, but sound like hand wringing Draculas whenever they do. Naturally, they invented Capitalism as a means to enslave the world and the only reason Communist nations failed is because Abstergo sabotaged them. Now the hip, young, altruistic socialists known as the Assassins must stop them. This is not an exaggeration, as the final glyph puzzle clearly shows the Assassins backing Maoist anti-Capitalism demonstrations. I have no problem with political messaging in games when it's not done in a way that's making it painfully clear that the author is leading you to think in a certain way. ACBH's writers do this with all the subtlety of a howling gorilla hurtling down the side of a hill. Seriously childish stuff here.

- The controls remain virtually untouched from AC2, meaning free running can still feel sticky, unpredictable, and overly exacting at times. This typically becomes apparent in sections where time is of the essence. Not having the left analogue stick perfectly centered in the direction you want to go in can lead you jumping off to your death, not landing a jump smoothly, or running up a wall completely in the opposite direction. This often can lead to failed objectives and potentially having to restart entire missions. Most moments of frustration I had during my playthrough can be attributed to this. It's also worth noting that the controls for DaVinci's war machines are complete dogsh*t. Have fun completing the flying machine mission...

- There's now an option in the menu to restart missions instead of just aborting them... But you can't restart from checkpoints, so it still sucks. Completely restarting missions often means having to redo tedious traversal sections and sitting through cutscenes that are still unskippable for some godforsaken reason. You may be thinking, “I'll just suicide or fail the mission objective to desync.” You can and it will start you from the checkpoint... But if you fail the bonus objective for any reason, you don't get a second chance. You have to restart the whole thing. This is exceedingly punitive and accomplishes nothing except wasting the player's time. Challenge should mostly be a test of one's skills, not patience.


Overall:

ACBH is essentially a massive expansion pack for AC2. There's tons to do, tons to see, and a large map to do it all in. However, all the improvements and gameplay additions can only be considered incrementally better at best. If you weren't impressed with the story presented in AC2, you're not going to be interested at all in the further adventures of Ezio/Desmond.

But what the game does offer is dozens of hours of the great core gameplay present in its predecessor, but arguably done even better. If you've recently played AC2 and just couldn't get enough of it, this one is for you. If you're not all that keen on seeing what happens to Ezio and are looking for more of a step forward when it comes to gameplay, you'll most likely be better served with AC3 or better yet, Black Flag. Still, I do give ACBH a thumbs up. At a discounted price, this title packs in a lot of value.",1637094963,1637094963,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Taking place in a single city this time around, Rome, it expands the world outside the city walls as well, to include countless ruins that still stand today that dot the area and plenty of collectibles to find, relaxingly less so than the previous games. Since direct sequel plenty of familiar faces make a return, some more than the others, and offer more in the way of story, character development and progression. From stumbling into the Assassin role in previous game, Ezio grows up a lot during his stay in Rome, becoming a Master at the end, a deserving title for someone that's done so much. The present day parts of the game reveal more of the Isu story, more so at the end, as well as ending the game on an exciting cliffhanger.
A new addition to the franchise is the recruits system, men and women Ezio can help and train to eventually become full fledged Assassins themselves, aiding him from the shadows and making quick work of the enemies in his path.
The game offers 2 DLCs. The Copernicus Conspiracy is not unlike the main game's missions to tail and assassinate, whereas The Da Vinci Disappearance offers a bit more variety. It expands on Ezio's friendship with Leonardo, introduces Leonardo's partner and confidant and involves Pythagoras, even if only by name, and for someone that's played Odyssey it will more than a little sound familiar to the story.
Even though big upgrade from the previous title, the game does suffer from awkward camera angles and fixed movements that are at times more detrimental than helpful due to expanded combat system. The horse also receives a downgrade in speed, which is a shame since there's a lot of area outside the city walls to
traverse and running faster than the horse makes the trusted companion obsolete, safe for few collectibles and challenges where the horse is a must. Few missions also suffer by the lack of checkpoints that are few and far between, making replaying certain parts of them for 100% sync a bit harsh.

With that said, there is enough to keep Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood fresh throughout it's runtime from unique jumping dungeons to a plethora of mission types.  Although Brotherhood doesn't provide the ultimate expansive world like later installments, for it's time ACB is definitely an achievement, ushering in the age of open world games that I love so much. 

I've heard these games were 'remastered' but they're only available on Uplay.  With that said I can only judge the original version of the game, bugs and all.  Technically, it functions just fine but the OG AC jank rears it's head in the climbing (shooting of in random directions or thousands of feet in the air.)  As well as some questionable design choices in the armor progression.

The story in AC Brotherhood picks up where the previous game left off, and on the whole, it's funny and entertaining throughout.  I've had more than a few laughs throughout Brotherhood's runtime, modern day and historical setting included.

TL;DR AC Brotherhood is solid, and for any fan of the franchise is a must own.  If you haven't played an AC game, this one could very well be a good starting point to get introduced to the franchise.  In 2021, the graphics are solid and the gameplay is good enough to not be rage-inducing jank like AC Unity and Black Flag.",1636071462,1636071462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ohh man. Where to start?

It runs through the Ubisoft Connect launcher, and when they update the launcher, it'll occasionally break Brotherhood's ability to launch. It does come with an installer for a 2011 version of the Ubisoft Launcher, (UPlay) but if you want to use the old launcher, you can't be hooked up to the internet. Otherwise the launcher will update to the current version and break again.

The game is also the only entry in the Assassin's Creed games available on Steam that doesn't have Cloud saves through Ubisoft.

It also has 'partial controller support.' Which really means everything but the triggers of an Xbox or PSN controller work just fine. You can restore full functionality by downloading controller emulation software and mapping your controller. I use x360ce. It's as simple as downloading the software, putting it in your Brotherhood folder, (Assassin's Creed 1, 2, and Revelations had the same problem and the same fix. Dead Rising 2 and OTR also have the same issue.) and configuring the software.

Brotherhood also doesn't like to create a saves folder. You'll need to go to :c/users/*username*/ubisoft/assassinscreedbrotherhood and create a saves folder for the game to save properly.

Graphics are great, soundwork and voiceovers are as good as always for the series, the fighting has been improved and you can really use heavy weapons now, etc. I would love it except for one thing that ruins everything: the controls. [/h1]

Granted, this problem has been there in all AC-games, but with all the new moves and abilities in Brotherhood, as well as the stricter requirements on most missions, it is many times more glaring than it was before. Most of the time Ezio does the exact oppsite of what you feel you are telling him to, and with the mouse and keyboard, which I prefer, there is a huge problem with the camera being locked when you are jumping, preventing you from getting the direction right for the next jump, as well as idiotic button configuration. Who decided to make the buttons for grabbing and letting go of walls the same? And who thought it was a good idea to press E to activate tunnels for purchase, but Shift to activate them for use?

After all this - i switched to a wired XBOX 360 Gamepad.

I'm not exaggerating if I tell you that 9 out of 10 times I get hit or fail a mission, it's because of some bug or control issue. Let me give you an example:

I'm playing a mission where I have to kill a group of guards without being noticed. I decide to climb onto a pillar and drop down on them, killing them with the dual hidden blade. For some reason Ezio decides to only hit one of them, because of a tiny fault in my aiming, which is impossible to see, and the other guy immediately sees me. Mission failed, start over.

This time I try to shoot a lone guard. For some reason the camera suddenly changes to view behind Ezio, the shot fires in the wrong direction even though the guard was highlighted, and the noise alerts him. Mission failed, start over.

This time I try to walk up behind two guards and stab them. Again Ezio decides to kill only one, despite being exactly in the middle of them, and again I am spotted. Mission failed, start over.

And this happens over and over and over again in every single mission. This game COULD have been great. Instead it's an exercise in angry hair removal because some things doesn't work as intended. Some quests are buggy, the final mission in sequence 9 can't even be started with more than 60 fps (I had to lock it there) yadda yadda.

Atleast the Game was enjoyable but controls and bugs are a huge con here. 7/10 for me but the story is actually pretty good. It was fun, despite its issues.

I'm talking about this Bug (SPOILER ALERT):

When I replayed it recently i definitely enjoyed it more than I remember especially since you return to the briefly visited Rome. This time around however Ezio's status as a master assassin finally comes centerfold since as the subtitle implies you lead the brotherhood and train new assassins that will help you in reclaiming Rome. And it's genuinely a fun system especially when it comes to inducting them as a master assassin. Reclaiming Rome is also another fun thing since it feels like a heavily expanded Villa from the previous game with its own little caveats that make things interesting. This game also has a nice little jaw dropper of an ending one little warning with this game is for a game from 2011 you will have technical issues due to optimization so do be aware of that when you do jump in. But all in all I highly recommend Ezio's second chapter for anyone new to the series.,1634279884,1634279884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Assassins Creed Brotherhood is amazing. Combat that's wayy too easy but makes you feel badass, stealth thats pretty fun once you get the hang of it, parkour that feels great, and an atmosphere thats simply outmatched. The story follows Ezio Auditore, straight off the start of Assassins Creed II, and arguably the best video game protagonist. He needs to rebuild the Italian Assassin Brotherhood so he can fight back against Cesare Borgia, the Pope's nephew. While the story itself isn't too memorable, Ezio Auditore is written perfectly and has an amazing VA, and same goes for Cesare Borgia. Their final fight was amazing, however I won't go too into it. 
Overall, if you have played Assassins Creed II, which I highly recommend if you haven't, I definetley recommend checking out this game

Then there comes the actual missions. And this is where the devs really F'd this game.

Stupidest, stupidest, STUPIDEST way of notifying a player, even more stupid to think its fun for the player. AC2 felt rewarding to get it all done, this already feels like a GD chore and I cannot bring myself to 100% this, because life is too short and the objectives too ridiculous.

""Dont be detected"" immediately (and I'm talking immediately) detected. ""Get to the end in 8 minutes) oops, Ezio decided he wanted to just jump off the wall and reverse the last 3 minutes. ""Keep a kill streak of 5 guards"" attack one guard and Ezio jumps off the horse, stabs the target, the animation takes forever for him to get up, target lost, mission failed. I should be having fun, not fighting the game.....

God this game annoys me. And due to that constant annoyance. Breaks immersion so necessarily.

I was shocked during my replay of Brotherhood, as I remember it being one of my favorites in the series, yet I enjoyed it the least out of these first three I've replayed over the past month. While it's by no means bad, it just never stands toe-to-toe with Assassin's Creed II, let alone surpasses it.

If the multiplayer was still in service, I'd be giving this an enthusiastic recommendation, but unfortunately, it has been discontinued. As it stands, it's easily the most buggy AC game I've replayed so far, with enemies popping into the world literally less than a foot ahead of you, levers, platforms, railings, and other such platforming tools outright refusing to work, and just a general technical mess mar the experience tremendously.

Fortunately, it makes sense. Brotherhood is a continuation of Ezio Auditore’s story of Assassin’s Creed II and it will be a few more years before we will officially see Assassin’s Creed III anyway. So first; Brotherhood:

In this game Ezio starts rebuilding the Assassin order, with a few twists and turns along the way, as expected.
Gameplay is largely the same with a few noteworthy additions. Mainly the ability to recruit and train assassins and send them out on little quests (which will be automated; you won’t accompanying any of them) to gather items. 
Combat has also been upgraded with the throwing of weapons, along with some tweaks to make fights flow a bit more.
And, of course, the multiplayer which was left out just a couple of games later. With Assassin’s Creed originally being a single player game focus was, again, later shifted into improving and expanding the single player portion of the game. While the multiplayer can be incredibly tense (it plays more like an advanced game of hide and seek, but with kills) and works very well, the choice to focus on single player was the right thing to do in my opinion as that’s what people were looking for.
There are more tweaks and additions, but these are mostly very small or aren’t used that often and therefore won’t be mentioned right now.
With every Assassin’s Creed getting larger and larger more bugs and glitches are also continually introduced. They’re quite limited here - at least, I didn’t notice many when I first played it - but it’s something to be expected.
The controls themselves are excellent (having played them all with a controller) but scaling buildings can sometimes be frustrating with some accidental and unfortunate jumps.

From here on out - until Assassin’s Creed III - the graphics will only be slightly upgraded. This one has more detailed and accurate faces, for example. Buildings and environments are still as detailed and beautiful as ever, as the NPCs have more variety in their outfits (and activities).
Using the same voice actors for Ezio and a few other recurring characters makes the voice acting quality feel consistent and of high quality, and music fits the theme of the game and important moments quite well.

I personally had more fun with this Assassin’s Creed than I did with part II, but that’s maybe because this feel game felt a little more complete; something we will notice with each new game in the series.
Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is an excellent game. Ubisoft has really outdone itself by constantly improving and adding new features to these game, and it will reach a critical point with Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag.

Now for the review

The second game in Ezios trilogy offers an extended look into the life of the rennisance based assassin with more characters and former returning characters from the prior game. The plot is the continued extension of Borgia control this time being over the central power of italy, Rome or Roma.

(i say this abruptly not to ruin the storyline)

as for gameplay the vastly improved yet easier combat system makes for exciting killstreaks and finnishing blows to the enemies and templars faced in the game. the addition of the assassins brotherhood and guild makes for a reliable and supportive brotherhood when facing the papal army and delinquents who seek to get in the way of ezios goal

the game also introduces the use of the piece of eden which makes for very interesting combat

now to what i dislike. The story seems quite brimmed if the guild missions are evaded, and the completionist levels sometimes prove very tedious (reffering to the war machines mission with the tank) and some of the time based missions including ones where health loss is restricted if not permitted.

Other than this a brilliant addition to ezios trilogy and the extension on desmonds modern journey against the modern abstergo templars including more about the secretive and interesting Isu species.

9/10 in my opinion as the story of AC2 will always be better to me ;) but i know this is a fan favourite

Framerate being uncapped is probably the best improvement over AC2, and the city of Rome and the tombs of Romulus are even better than the Assasin tombs and multiple cities of Florence, Venice, Forli of the previous. The only step down for me is the story unfortunately. While AC2 had a tight, revenge-propelled story that was elevated even more by the incredible villain of Rodrigo Borgia, the story here does take a step down as Cesare is not nearly as menacing or even interesting as his father was in the last game. The only motive for stopping Cesare is simply the fact that he kills Mario at the beginning of the game and steals the Apple of Eden. Whereas Rodrigo was cold, calculating, mysterious and always seemed to have multiple conspiracies and plans running through the multiple different cities of AC2, Cesare is simply a hot-headed asshole who desires power and really has no depth to his character the way Rodrigo did.

Besides that, basically same game.
I'm 4 hours into the game by the time this review was made. Too early to make a review? Maybe, but there's a reason.
While the story and gameplay in general are still very interesting, I can't accept the way it's designed.
Areas got tightly locked, but legends are still shown on the map. I'm the type who wants to open all chests, go to all towers, doing all the side content first, then I proceed with main quests later and I absolutely can't do it in this game.
Plus the ""100% synchronization"" gimmick. The initial intention of this might be to make the game somehow more challenging, but this is also terrible. It encouraged you do exactly to have 100% sync to unlock stuff behind, therefore limit your creativity and your open-world experience.
And you still can't unequip your armors. Terrible all-round.
Summary, terrible game design lead to unenjoyable experiences. Not recommened.

EDIT: After 9 more hours into the game, my statement still stays. Unenjoyable.
As you play more, you'll meet your nemesis: Fixed camera angle with messed up direction.
I was in the lair, it requires me to finish it in 8 mins for 100% sync. Inside it also has alot of chests and flags. How the hell am I supposed to do all of it in one-shot? Well pretty much clear that they don't want you to do it, and I REALLY, REALLY hate this forceful mechanic.

AC 2's port was really rough and unoptimized. Luckily, most of the problems with AC 2's port are fixed in this one. The v-sync framerate cap is no longer at 59 instead of 60, so there's a lot less stuttering. The game also recognizes the Xbox Controller properly so now I can play the game with a controller without having to either download a controller emulator or scroll through community configs. There still is some mouse acceleration that can't be disabled, but I haven't checked to see if it's better or worse than AC 2's, which was really aggressive. The only problem I can think of that is still in this port was the CPU usage. If you have a quad core or above, the game will start using way more CPU power than needed, causing huge amounts of stuttering. If you go into task manager or process lasso, you can change the affinity in the ""details"" tab on task manager, or just the application icon in process lasso. Disabling CPU 0 basically eliminates stuttering, or at least reduces it by a ton. There is one new issue, and that's if you're at the very edge of Rome and look off into the distance, say towards the Coliseum, then FPS will drop by a ton. It doesn't really happen if you're towards the center of Rome, which is nice. Now onto the actually game and not the PC port. The parkour is a lot more fun in this, especially since Rome is much bigger than any of the areas in AC 2. There's also more control with the parkour than before. It feels way more responsive than 2. The graphics have been seriously upgraded since AC 2. Draw distance for shadows, buildings, grass, and people have been increased greatly. Shadows now have a soft edge to them unlike AC 2's very sharp, low res shadows. Texture quality is much higher, and ambient occlusion is much higher quality than before. Just about everything graphics wise looks better in this than before. I wish Ubisoft tried to stick to something close to this. Now they just make the same open world RPG each year.

Assassin's Creed franchise is one of most famous videogame series now but I also need to mention here the fact that the early Assassin's Creed games are really important for my generation. I was still in school when original Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed II with its both stand-alone expansions were getting released. Well, the final game about Ezio's story, Revelations, was released shortly after I finished school. So, apart of my personal story related to those amazing games, I want to say that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is so well-done experience and you absolutely shall play it after finishing Assassin's Creed II. Ezio is a very charismatic and beloved character indeed and if we see him just in the beginning of his story in the Assassin's Creed II, here in Brotherhood he is truly experienced warrior and adult man. But besides of that he is also leader of Assassins Brotherhood and this very interesting aspect of the game, which makes it so cool. Now you can hire new members into brotherhood and even use them in combat. Pressing ""T"" key will summon assassins who will fight for you at any time and in any place. And while there are many missions with the same tasks like in previous game, this gameplay mechanics makes completing them so fun once again. Not even mentioning that you will truly feel yourself a leader of the Brotherhood!",1629897722,1629897869,True,19,0,0.708604872226715088,2,True,False,False

Because it, and the main character Ezio, embodies what the Creed of Assassin's is meant to be; the struggle against forces which aim to control humanity. In AC II: Brotherhood, you struggle against the Borgia family, which is an oppressive force in Rome which has corrupted both the city and the church. You see Ezio's struggle with following the creed and fighting for the liberty of his fellow people, as well as hunting down criminals and people who make their living by making other people's lives worse. In all games following this, with the exception of perhaps III to some extent. no thought is given to the creed and underlying message of the Assassins. Ezio holds the creed highly, and all assassin's recruited does too, while assassin's in later games only seem to be either just ""a thing that exists"" or a violent personality cult (such as in rougue). You also get to actively rebuild Rome, rebuilding shops, aqueducts, stables and such which has fallen into disrepair following the oppression of the Borgia, and also delve deep into the mysteries of the city.

It's a common narrative that Assassin's Creed II was a poster child of a sequel; one which ran with the concepts of the original, and more fully realised its potential. Brotherhood manages to do this a second time in spectacular fashion; harnessing the characters we grew to love from AC II, expanding the variety of side activities, and introducing additional interesting gameplay loops.

I was surprised when I realised the entire game took place in a single city, Rome, seeing as the previous and many of the later games contain several cities/locations to traverse. However, it soon became clear that this wasn't an issue; the Rome depicted here is large and contains sufficiently varied districts to not feel samey. In fact, this is the world I spent the most time in up until this point (39 hrs compared to 17 hrs and 28 hrs in AC 1 and AC II respectively), and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.

The story holds up compared to AC II, and sees Ezio systematically disassemble the Borgia family by hidden blade, whilst he reaches a new stage in his life where he is looked up to by his Assassin initiates. This brings me to the Brotherhood recruitment system, which is new for this entry, and allows the deployment of Assassins to help Ezio out in stealth or combat. This opens the door for more strategy than before, and adds variety to the stealth/combat loop, which is welcome. The power you feel when calling in a crossbow airstrike is immense!

Events in Renaissance Rome tie into the sci-fi and modern day elements in a way that excited me as a fan of that side of the series, but is not so intrusive as to put off people who are only in it for the historical tales. Graphically, Brotherhood looks a chunk better than AC II, namely since there's less pop-in which helps avoid the break in immersion. Also there's a (perhaps intense) ambient occlusion implementation which gives it depth and makes it look a more modern game, while helping it look a bump up from AC II.

In all, this game still holds up and offers a more dense 'Classic' Assassin's Creed experience than its predecessors, carrying the momentum of quality from AC II in terms of narrative and gameplay, whilst bringing its own new spin.",1597525845,1628910059,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

The first Sequence was so SO cool, loved the set piece!. But after that first sequence the game really slows down for a few sequences which I wasn't a huge fan of, but the game really picks up once they introduce most/all of its mechanics. That's where I had the most fun in the game. Oh! And the OST.... GOD TIER! I could even say it's MORE God Tier than AC 2's God Tier OST. It's just so damn GOOD!! IMO the beginning of the story really didn't grasp me as much as AC 2 did (That shit got my attention almost instantly!). There were also some small plot points where I didn't fully agree with, but not big enough to be a massive complaint. Also, Brotherhood is a little shorter than AC 2 by just a couple of sequences, so take that as you will. I don't know if anyone else had this problem. but for me the render distance most of the time was pretty ass, I would just be walking and people are just start to pop in, and textures would pop in and out. A problem I did not have with AC 2. Overall, I had lots of fun, it's a very very good game. Even though I still enjoyed AC 2 much more than Brotherhood, it did add and change some of the gameplay/mechanics where at times I like a LOT more than some of AC 2's mechanics.

So yes, I'm a fan of Assassin's Creed franchise (the older franchises) and the Ezio Trilogy definitely mean something for me in terms of its story. So if you like the story of Assassin's Creed 2, you might as well purchase the rest of Ezio's stories too.

As for the combat system, I would say it has improvements compare to the previous one. The combo kill is just too OP. With a little bit of reflex training, you are basically an one man army. So is this good or bad? I'll say it depends on your personal preference regarding the elements of a game (it's good for me as long as it looks damn cool).

The sound design though, the only thing I feel less satisfying is the pistol firing sound. I don't know why they change it into something like firecracker.

As for the level design, I guess this is where they started to make things more 'challenging'. They've added full synchronization criteria for every level/mission. I would say it is frustrating sometimes (probably because I'm noob idk). But if you don't care too much about getting 100% completion, it's fine, you can come back and retry the levels anytime. 

And the map, the infamous map. There are so many things on the map in this series. Treasure locations, collectibles, missions and side missions, shops, and landmarks. Fortunately, you can filter/set display of the icons on the map which I would highly recommend doing that.

Last but not least, some miscellaneous I wish to comment such as the 'parkour' element. Not sure if it is my fault or what, I feel like its easier to fall from the ledge in Brotherhood compare to AC 2. It can get really frustrating when you are chasing a target or completing a race. But like I said, you'll get used to it, just retry the level ;)

More weapons, massively improved combat flow. New armour sets, more unlocks an expanded investment system. Run your own guild.

If you wanted more from Assassin's Creed 2 this game is perfect for you.


The combat has been massively overhauled, better tutorials, more weapons and the ability to chain executions along with brutal execution animations make the combat feel way better. It flows much faster and freer now, though it's not particularly challenging. 

The map is beautiful, Rome really does have a unique feel. Some areas are quite ""modern"" others are just ancient ruins full of squatters. There's dense city streets, small villages and wide open plains. Seriously the map has more verity and detail in one city than games like GTA 5 do in an entire American state! 

Being able to ride your horse everywhere in the map also makes travelling a lot more fun, though I question the fast travel system because it feels really redundant. 

Also the construction and investment mechanics from 2 have been vastly expanded, instead of renovating one tiny village all of Rome is your project. Its great, you can open new shops restore famous monuments and all kinds of stuff. And just like in 2 as you buy and change things the map will evolve, new paths open up new NPCs will spawn and the whole area becomes a lot cleaner looking. It also ties really well into the inevitable Ubisoft tower climbing mechanic, I feel like I'm actually going after the Borgia towers for a reason. And like I'm being rewarded for it.

Building your own guild is also fun, recruits can go on behind the scenes missions in other towns (something I've always loved) or you can keep them on hand to summon, either to kill enemies in stealth or join you in a fight. It's a bit over powered but I still enjoy it.

The story is where Assass Brotherhood starts to fall down. 
Ezio's character arch, the most interesting aspect of 2 is basically done. There is no real want for revenge (Beyond Ezio arbitrarily not killing Rodrigo Borgia at the end of the last game) or any motivation. The villains are so much less personal now. Also Ezio starts becoming a historically inaccurate Marry Sue. Despite being in his forties he is faster and stronger than people in their twenties, he suffers no major set backs from being shot off a roof top at the start of the game, and women all want to bang him and numerous historical figures consider him the perfect man. (He literally inspires all of Machiavelli's philosophy and writing.)

There's also one absolutely fucking atrocious scene. During a flashback Ezio meets his old love Christina, who tells him her fiance is about to be killed. Ezio saves the man and then forces himself on Christina, kissing her against her will even though he knows she's going to be married. 
He then does it again later when the pair meet in another flashback, but this time he tricks Christina into thinking he's actually her husband!

Thats outright sexual assault! Nearly fucking rape! It's disgusting and irredeemable, it basically ruins Ezio's entire character retroactively by turning him into a creepy sex pest. 

It gets even more fucked up when you remember an earlier flashback where Ezio saves Christina from another creep whose trying to pull the exact same stunt on her. 
Were the writers just not thinking during these flashbacks? I mean what the fuck!

If you can ignore Ezio's character being outright assassinated by the writers, then the gameplay is solid definitely more of what Assassins Creed 2 already proved as good. But I personally just can't shake how gross those scenes made me feel.",1626562452,1626562452,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thus, there isn’t that much difference concerning most of the game’s aspects compared to its predecessor. The two probably most important qualities received a major change though; story and gameplay, exactly the two which made Assassin’s Creed II such a good game. Also, this marks the first time Assassin’s Creed turned towards AAA titles as we know them today, adding stuff like additional objectives, achievements, and the mandatory multiplayer of course.

Graphics: Looking only slightly sharper than Assassin’s Creed II, this game looks a surprising lot better, thanks to brighter colors and further view. Although still looking pale compared to a modern game’s color palette, this is the Assassin’s Creed to start the development towards said palette. Not all of the graphics criticism from Assassin’s Creed II is gone though, as the optimization still manages to amaze me with occasional frame-drops, needless to say, that this shouldn’t occur in a game that’s nearly a decade old by now.

Sound: The biggest change in terms of sound is the more spectacular OST, something you’re likely to notice downright in the main menu. This results in way more fitting background music during missions as well as in between them compared to the darker music of Assassin’s Creed II. Voice acting still doesn’t deliver any source of complain.

Atmosphere: Now rather carrying itself than being carried by the story compared to Assassin’s Creed II and also receiving better support by graphics and sound alike, the atmosphere is a lot more consistent than in its predecessors.

Story: This is where it actually lost quality; the story’s still good, but can’t quite compare to Assassin’s Creed II, despite a lot of similar ideas being used. Some missions also kinda feel like filler and thanks to the larger in-game world and the amounts of side quests within that world, more time passes before you move on to the next story mission. Quality of character interaction also suffered, characters which were important in Assassin’s Creed II now hardly get much screentime, meanwhile, antagonists are pretty much being recycled.

Balance: If Ezio’s balance was like that of his second game, he wouldn’t be an assassin. It would be shorter to list the things which work than to name those which don’t. First off, money is rather a nuisance than an aspect of gameplay anymore, thanks to a system that allows you to receive money from stores after you liberated them, halfway through the game I pretty much had enough money to buy everything purchasable. Combat seemingly has become more complex now, as you, as well as your enemies, have several more new moves at their disposal, but you’ll quickly notice that it’s even less challenging than ever before. Instead of overpowered counterattacks, you get killstreaks now, enabling you to one-click-kill some dozen enemies in a row, no matter their strength, without much of a hassle. And concerning the “stealth” part of gameplay; you get an auto-aiming, one-hit-killing crossbow with up to 25 shots, and by one-hit-killing, I mean killing even heavily armored enemies one-shot. The keyboard controls are just as awful as in Assassin’s Creed II.

Gameplay: The parkour system is pretty much the same as in Assassin’s Creed II as well; the mission design did get some more variety though. Overall, this game plays more like a modern-day open-world game compared to its predecessors.

Whether you’ll like this game or not is a question of priorities; someone who values an interesting story or challenging combat-/stealth system most won’t be too happy with this game compared to other Assassin’s Creed titles, someone who prefers a classical open-world game, values every aspect of a game equally and likes the setting should be fine though.",1554149327,1626281526,True,3,0,0.568345367908477783,0,True,False,False

Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is the third installment in a third-person stealth franchise that uses historical drama to tell its narrative. The gameplay consists of sneaking, platforming and combat within an open-world setting. It’s in many ways identical to AC2, including its many problems. The economy is still present and easily exploited, this time with fewer paintings but more notable architectural marks to be bought.

The story follows directly after the previous game AC2. Ezio is forced to flee to Rome, and the game makes use of a more small-scale plot within the borders of the city. Graphically it looks almost identical as well and the nicely vibrant colors-scheme remains.

Most of the notable characters are reoccurring people from AC2, and the one who’s new to this era and most notable is probably Cesare Borgia.
In his time he was accused of the murder of close adversaries and having an incestous relationship with his sister. In the game this is treated as fact. While ruthless, many of these accusations were mainly spread by his enemies, like the Sforza. A rival family who was most likely just as heinous as the Borgia. 

Ezio seems to have grown in his leading capabilities, with this comes the introduction of recruiting and upgrading your own assassins to the order. You can deploy them with you in combat or send them on missions to gain various rewards.

Brotherhood’s quest structure consists of Main Quests that further the story, as well as Side Quests, Contract Missions and item collecting. Like most of the games in the series the reward for collecting said items is seldomly worth the trouble.
I’ve often heard that Brotherhood is somehow a shorter game with less filler than its predecessor. I have to question this however, as there were always a ton of repetitive and spread out tasks that were constantly filling up the map. The game took me far longer to complete and it felt like a lot of this “content” could have been cut out and it would have made the pacing of the game much better. 

The Deluxe Edition includes a DLC storyline involving Leonardo DaVinci’s disappearance. It’s an engaging and short plot with a change in scenery and includes a wide arrange of vehicle gameplay. You get to meet Salaì, one of DaVinci’s disciples and alleged lovers. I recollect Ezio implying he knows of this affair and that he approves of it, something that makes Leonardo fluster a bit. It was a nice addition for sure and it felt like it contributed to the chemistry between the two. 

Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is often portrayed as one of the best in the series, and if this is true I’m afraid of what’s to come. This game reeks of what plagues this franchise to begin with. Tedious trailing missions, pacing issues, boring combat, useless collectibles, copypasted side activities and an overall lackluster narrative. 
Despite all of this, there’s fun to be had in short bursts. It’s like the game is edging the player and promising it will get good soon, only to abruptly end your enjoyment a few seconds later.",1626144536,1626144536,False,4,0,0.542988240718841553,0,True,False,False

There were so many technical issues that prevented me from enjoying the game, not to mention the absolutely egregious amounts of ""tail so-and-so without being detected"" missions. There are also more than a few ""follow so-and-so"" missions, and when the player's base walk speed is faster than the NPC's walk speed, you have constantly walk and then stop and then walk and then stop and then walk and then stop and then walk and then stop and then walk and then stop and then walk and then stop and then walk and then stop and then walk and then stop and then walk and then stop and then walk and then stop and then walk and then stop. WHAT is the POINT of having FOLLOW missions if your BASE SPEED doesn't match the NPC?????!?!? It's so frustrating!

Not to mention it took me 40 minutes to get the cutscene that precedes the final fight to activate; I had to change my refresh rate and turn off vsync and then run the game from the game files as an administrator. So dumb. 

Overall, the story and concept of this game is absolutely fantastic, and if the gameplay itself were better, I would easily award it a 8/10.

However, the game is so horribly unpolished and unbalanced that I cannot look past it.

6/10.

Brotherhood has removed that entirely in favor of making you do everything with the mouse, who's cursor is unbelievably finnicky and almost ""sticky"" (you'll see what I mean when you play the game), or you have to move with WASD and select with enter and exit with backspace.

Rather than re-hash a lot of similar feelings for Assassin's Creed Brotherhood I figured I would be a bit more concise with the good and the bad. However, I can definitely say this game is worth playing if you are on the fence of purchasing!

The good? Property/wealth management of buildings in Rome, recruiting a ""Brotherhood"" of assassins, some fun (but familiar) combat, and the exploration of the region for the game.

The bad? No major innovation on combat from game-to-game, graphics don't hold up as well a decade later, some of the quests/missions can be a tad shallow, and some minor technical issues with the PC port.

Like I mentioned above, definitely worth playing especially if you are knocking out the Ezio trilogy but beware of some of the minor issues!",1624403679,1624403679,True,7,0,0.58190840482711792,0,True,False,False

There are some improvements though. Voice acting is far better and doesn’t sound cringy anymore. The graphics are much smoother and don’t look as soapy as before. Characters models and backgrounds have become pretty at last. The new assassins recruit system is rather neat, sending your fellow assassins to missions and calling them in to a fight looks and is effective in a conflict with big groups of guards and just makes you feel like a badass assassin leader. The city economic system is okay, it is quite the same as it was in previous game, but little wider and complex. Music is still good, and the story is okay.

Now, the bad sides. There are a lot of situations when instead of just showing you a cutsene, the developers make you follow some NPC, who is giving you some brifieng/lore/not-related gameworld info. Classic stupid mechanic straight from the 90-00-s that is absolutely not fun. It is extremely tedious, especially the fact, that their walking speed is faster than yours and slower then your running speed. The combat have become much more dynamic and fast-flowing, with the implementation of fast executions, but it is still pretty repetitive and too simple. The interface for most of the side activities, like the city economics or assassin recruits missions is awful and unconventional. The other problem is new gimmick – 100% syncronisation side-missions which unlocks the true story ending, but requires you to complete the missions in the way the developers want you to. But why should I? Where is the freedom of a choice? Why shouldn’t I play the game like I want to?

The multiplayer mode is great by the way, had some fun playing it at release. As for now - i highly doubt, you will ever find a full lobby of players.

All in all, it is an okay game, for its initial release at least. I mean, it is not terrible or something it just may not deserve your time. But if you’re looking for a relaxing almost 0-brain activity open world game to play after a work while sipping on a glass of beer – this is definitely your choice.",1606497224,1624385594,True,9,0,0.607667744159698486,0,True,False,False

After playing 1 and 2, I really appreciate the graphics of this game. They really are extremely decent for a game this age. The game mechanics are very nice and I feel like a lot has gotten smoother as compared to the second AC game.

Where I would say the story of AC brotherhood is not as strong as AC2 (mostly due to this game focusing less on Ezio himself and more on the brotherhood in general), I would have to also mention that the ability to signal other assassins to come to your aid is a great feature. A feature purely unique to this game, as far as I know (haven't reached the other games yet. Revelations is next.).

All in all, I would say this is a great game and what's even better is that it still belongs to the row of AC games that are still true to the main mechanics. Whereas AC 2 mostly had collectibles after the main story was done, this installment would probably be the first I would play until I have completed it fully. Side missions are available, and rebuilding Roma and collecting way fewer items actually make me want to finish it entirely. This is also the first game where I enjoyed the music a lot. The enging, where I think AC 2 was more shocking, still left me confused and wanting more.

The main problem on PC is there's several major game breaking bugs that revolve around vsync not being enabled (Flying machine mission and Pax Romana mission) and these both involve enabling vsync but also probably enforcing its use through your graphics card control panel in windows, which is awkward and annoying.

You combine the good portions of those two games and add in some extra stuff such as the Assassin recruits, liberation and such and you have a good blend of what this game really is. Although the MAIN story mode is shorter than AC 2, the side missions totally make up for it. 

Some tips I'd love to offer:
Farming money in this game is not really a big of a deal as once you unlock the thief guild ability (pickpocketing), you get to generate money on the go! Also recruit new assassins and keep sending them to do the lower difficulty missions in the contracts so they level up faster after you call them for help. Invest a lot whenever possible so you have enough money to at least renovate a shop or a landmark so they generate money when you withdraw from the banks. Also try to complete all the Lairs of Romulus missions and loot every single chest you find in the levels. Many will give you florins as usual but some of the chests contain rare trade items necessary for you to unlock certain things in the shop quests. Combat is really easy in this game while navigation can be a challenge at times, you can easily complete all the virtual training missions and get an outfit by getting all gold.

I've played this game when it first came out and its a blast to still play this and AC 2 all over again and is a must play.",1623624578,1623624578,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay hasn't really improved from ACII, but the graphics have slightly and running, jumping and climbing through Rome during the Renaissance feels awesome.
The story isn't as good as in ACII, but definitely not bad and it involves some funny twists with characters you might remember from the predecessor. Speaking of which, it does make sense playing ACII first because Brotherhood is a direct continuation of it and if you don't know the previous story, a lot of things won't make sense and you will have a hard time getting to know the characters, because their introduction is rather lacluster, as might be expected from a game that today would be a DLC.

My biggest critique is the part were you rebuild the city - it's not necessary to complete the game, but it makes things easier as you unlock quick travel possibilities and increase your income to buy better armor and weapons. 
It's a nice and immersive feature, but quickly devolves into a repetitive quest of finding the next bank or smith spot, running there, spending the 1000-ish gold of repairing the shop and waiting for the animation to finish. It does give the game a nice touch and fits well into the scenario, but it doesn't become interesting.

The second entry into what we know now as the Ezio Trilogy. Will it be another sucky sequel? Or spiritual successor? Lets get into it.

[h1] [b] The Good [/b] [/h1]

[*] [b] The Story [/b]

- Brotherhood boasts an interesting, yet shorter story than its predecessor. Without any spoilers, revenge yet again sets Ezio down the assassin's path, but this time he has no one to watch his back. He is in a new city and must make new connections while also watching his back against the oppressing Borgia. Definitely a fun time, as well as more interesting that I thought at first glance.

[*] [b] The Graphics [/b]

- Brotherhood also came in sporting some new looks! The original art style is kept around but it is now more polished, vibrant, and colorful. I mean no offense but come on, AC and AC2 weren't exactly much more than various shades of brown, so I appreciate the new look.

[*] [b] The Setting [/b]

- Finally an AC game with a famous and recognizable setting. In case you didn't see pictures of read the game description, AC Brotherhood is set within the city of Rome. No, not the boring version from AC2, this new really cool one with all of the ancient Roman ruins and undergrounds. I love history and I feel this is where the AC games made their turn into more historical settings. 

[*] [b] Gameplay Improvements [/b]

- A very general point. Fighting has some improvements, so does free-running and climbing. New climbing styles and techniques. Many new mechanics. Horses are not as clanky and dangerous as they were in AC2.  Just a bunch of nice little touch-ups from AC2.

[*] [b] The Restorations [/b]

- Anyone who has read my reviews before knows that I am a sucker for both single-player base-building and/or restoring broken and dingy areas in games. Brotherhood has both. You have an assassin's base which you can upgrade, decorate, and care for. You can also purchase shops throughout Rome, and once you have the money to do so, you can begin restoring and rebuilding the ancient ruins such as aqueducts and famous landmarks.

[h1] [b] The Bad [/b] [/h1]

[*] [b] The Combat [/b]

- Although I can say there are improvements to the combat in AC Brotherhood, generally I feel as if there was most disappointment than anything for it. New mechanics attempt to make it cooler and more fluid but instead force you into executions, prevent proper blocking, and force repetitive chains to kill enemies. I preferred the combat in AC2.

[h1] [b] The Ugly [/b]

[*] [b] The Glitches and Issues [/b]

- AC Brotherhood has quite a few issues. Starting off recently, an entire DLC disappeared and wouldn't trigger. Other times in-game, enemies or targets do not properly spawn. Quests do not always properly toggle. All of these together can lead to some frustration.

[h1] [b] Overall [/b] [/h1]

AC Brotherhood is what should of been a DLC to me. It is short, fun, and interesting to place. That being said, it does not always improve on everything and can tend to be a bit glitchy. Overall it is definitely a fun game, and any fan of the AC series should play it. Maybe get it on sale though.",1620391271,1620391271,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story of Ezio continues and deepens, the gameplay feels more fluid, the areas are bigger and easier to explore, the side quests feel more relevant.

New animations, added kill-streaking so you could smoothly free-flow in combat sort of like Batman Arkham style which is really a lot of fun.  They also made the combat a little harder by making Ezio take more damage per hit and not just being able to automatically counter everybody regardless of weapon type. 

Another pro is that this game adds even better mysteries to the narrative with the Followers of Romulus as well as the other Tombs like in the DLC The Da Vinci Disappearance. They just did such a nice job with the narrative in this game, making it fun, exciting, and mysterious at the same time while maintaining and respecting canon for the series. 

This game, like AC2, will take around 20-40 hours depending on how much of the side content you do. It takes me around 38-40 hours to play and do about 99% of the content. 

Some negatives are mainly that some of the final mission combat is poor as you have a specific ""weapon"" (don't want to spoil anything) that makes the combat and running around really clunky, but I will say the very final combat engagement between Ezio and Cesare Borgia is really well-done. 

Another small pet peeve would be that some of the cinematics and memory sequences are not very well designed in terms of how they fit together. For example when you complete Sequence 7 it gives you an automatic cutscene that shows Ezio being promoted and essentially heading off to complete the final mission...which would be all well and good if it was the only thing left, but the player will always have a ton more side content that they didn't finish at that point so it just doesn't flow narratively well, there. Same with the Da Vinci Disappearance DLC package - you should play it after the main game ends, but it actually fits BEFORE the final fight with Cesare, so things are just kind of out of order at times which disrupts storyflow a little bit, but overall, these are minor things. 

Overall rating: 9.8 / 10 - Very Strongly Recommended

This is an excellent game that I'd highly recommend. This game was made back when Ubisoft was still a good company and developer and really tried to make good games for their customers. Nowadays not so much. This is also one of the ""real"" Assassin's Creed games, unlike the later entries of 2017 and newer that are just open world combat games that copy Witcher 3 with a good bit of feminism injected into the narrative and the Assassin's Creed logo slapped on the cover.",1614220370,1620092763,True,15,0,0.698474109172821045,0,True,False,False

Play time: 15-20 hours

Story: 12/12
There are so many things to love about this story. Like the last game, the characters are all very enjoyable. Brotherhood has one of the best villains out of any other AC game, and having to rebuild the brotherhood while recruiting your own assassins is a blast. It's a shame this feature only exists in Brotherhood (and Revelation). 

Setting: 7/12
The streets of Rome are great fun to explore. The viewpoints have a sort of parkour puzzle that you have to complete in order to reach the top which makes it a lot more intricate than other games. 

Combat: 5/12
Brotherhood's combat can be very fun, there are lots of enemy ranks and you have to watch out for many things such as halberd attacks and being shot at. You also have a multitude of tools at your disposal and the finishing animations can be delightfully brutal. The ability to have assassins  come to your aide in battle can make fights seem like a battle.

Missions and side activities: 10/12
This easily has the best side missions out of any other Assassins Creed game. The adventures with Leonardo and his prototypes are a ton of fun and help diversify the game. You also get actual rewards for completing side activities such as upgrading your villa and finding the keys to unlock the legendary assassin gear. 


Assassin: 10/10
Ezio is easily the best assassin of them all: He has character, and it's a delight to watch each cutscene unfold. He also has a great character arch over the trilogy, unlike most of the other assassins.

Overall rank: 12/12
Though a relatively short experience, it doesn't try to overstay its welcome like a lot of the later Assassins Creed games. It has the least repetition and some of the most memorable missions overall. It improved the formula in Assassins Creed 2 in almost every single way and is overall a fantastic experience.",1620087123,1620087173,True,6,0,0.564023911952972412,0,True,False,False

As a successor to Assassin's Creed 2 this game had a lot to live up to and I think it does a good job at continuing the greatness of its predecessor while also adding new elements that liven up the experience. But it doesn't add nearly as much to the series as 2 did.

Gameplay

It's not too different from 2 but does add a new combat system which makes it a lot easier and I think slightly worse as it reduces the difficulty and therefore the tension of most fights. Still fun though. There are more gadgets courtesy of Leonardo to play with which are fun if a little unbelievable. I think this game is where the series started to veer off into over-the-topness which doesn't ruin the experience but does make it a little harder to get fully invested in. Still some cool set pieces though.

I never really got into the multiplayer but I did play it a few times and it was okay I guess, not really my thing though. I appreciate the effort but I think it would have been better spent on the main story.

Story and Art Design

This game picks up after the amazing ending of 2 and continues to ramp up the tension around finding pieces of eden and figuring out more about the coming apocalypse and the plans of abstergo, all of which I love. It also continues the brilliant character arc of Ezio as he enters into a position of leadership within the brotherhood. There isn't that much progression with him as a character in this game but I do like that this is his peak in terms of skill and authority, which does kind of back up the easy combat.

In terms of art design I think this game has less to offer than 2 and it just feels somehow more rough around the edges, less refined than 2 was, which makes sense given its shorter development time. That said it's still a cool looking game and benefits greatly from the brilliance of the game before it.

Conclusion

Solid game. 7/10.",1619762380,1619762380,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat and free-running are both notably smoother in comparison. Assassin recruits were a great addition to the series. Rome somewhere in the middle of the pack across all the cities we've seen in these games.

Upon replaying it now 10 years after release, it's pretty disappointing to see how buggy this game is; I'm writing this review now as the climax of the game is bugging out beyond allowing me to progress through the mission. Semi-regular CTDs, Ezio turning invisible, etc...

The story is also very bare-bones compared to AC2 and Revelations, and you can see the 'Ubisoft-ification' of things beginning to take form as the proverbial pool becomes ever-wider and evermore-shallow. Maybe it felt more impressive when it came out, but now ""we need to remove the bad guy's control by sabotaging all his resources and lieutenants"" plot feels like nothing.

The story feels a lot more connected than AC2 and I'd say it's overall better than AC2's story. The gameplay is pretty much the same as AC2, and the dungeons also don't have the annoying timed sequences. One interesting change they did was that instead of all the shops being available from the start, you have to buy the shops which then increase your bank revenue. I thought this was a good solution to the large amounts of money you'd get in AC2 with nothing to spend it on.

What I wasn't too into were some tower mechanics. There are certain towers that are being controlled by guards and you have to assassinate 1 specific person and then you can climb up the tower and destroy it, freeing up Borgia influence (allowing you to buy shops in that area). It felt a little annoying to me honestly, but I suppose some people would like it.

Another thing that felt weird was that the game took place in only one city and had a big open world. It was interesting, but because of the way it was designed you can ride horses around the more open spaces but you can also ride horses in the streets. To be honest, it made the world feel a little small but not too bad.

Overall though, this game is fun. There's a new ""Brotherhood"" mechanic where you can recruit assassins and send them on missions. You can also call those assassins to help you in your missions, which was really cool. It does have some flaws but I'd say they're really not that bad, and the story and overall AC gameplay made this enjoyable.",1617734207,1617734207,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is really a title designed for fans of Assassin’s Creed II, as it’s a continuation of that story, but the reality is that people who finished that game want something new – or that at least represents a clear step forward. Brotherhood doesn’t deliver that. The game doesn’t advance the wider narrative very far, the new mechanics don’t really add a great deal and the mission designs rarely explore new gameplay possibilities.

But thas doesn't mean you can't enjoy what new has been given.

The story wasn't as gripping as Assassin's Creed 2 for me, but I liked all of the new features. The assassin recruits and city renovations were something I spent a good bit of time on getting to 100%. I also really enjoyed the Da Vinci invention missions, the various machines you got to play with were always something to look forward to. One of my favorite parts was the Cristina missions, to the point that I grinded out some of the side quests to get above 75% completion before starting sequence 8 so I could finish them. The voicemail messages in the glyphs were a nice touch and I enjoyed the conspiracies found in them more this time around. When it comes to the DLC, I really enjoyed the Da Vinci Disappearance but I didn't care much for Copernicus Conspiracy,

All in all, if you care about Ezio and/or Desmond and want to see how their stories continue, grab yourself this game and have fun!",1617433421,1617433546,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

========PART B========
One of the best Assassin's Creed games ever made. 
The controls still pose a problem. The game has a built-in Mouse Acceleration which eliminates precise movement of my mouse movement. 
This game has another big problem which causes many bugs in the story (The reason why i didn't mention this in the first section is that you can avoid it fairly easy - and stupidly) but it has a really easy fix, just enable V-Sync...
Big Open-World with many things to keep you occupied for quite a while.
Great story, great voice acting and awesome villain.
If you have to play an Assassin's Creed game, this is the one i'd recommend.

(The game offers easily around 20-30 hours of playtime, if you decide to do most-to-every little mission. I have so little hours cause this isn't my first time playing this game. As a matter of fact, this is my 4th time playing :D)

Automatically fixed camera angles in combination with direction controls related to camera direction lead to unpredictable character's response to pressing movement control keys. And this is even worsened by contextual keybinding where pressing same key leads to different actions depending on context. Simply speaking, you never exactly know what your character will do when you press a button. The templairs lair under the aqueduct (from deluxe edition) is almost unpassable just due to weird camera angles (i didn't have the patience to go on after 10 or so deaths from jumping in unpredictable direction).
Other less annoying issues:
-plenty of bugs (character stucks with no reason or shakes uncontrollably, so that you have to leave animus or quit the game; custom outfits override the mission-related outfits, so you still wear it in missions where you're supposed to be disguised wearing enemy outfits; Da Vinci's bomber is uncontrollable unless you set FPS limit to 48 and turn on V-sync)
-controls in puzzles are very weird sometimes (like using End button for instance) and you can't reassign it to your liking
-when camera isn't fixed it rotates uncontrollably sometimes

Overall it's same game as AC2, just on different map, with all AC2's pros and contras, but in AC2 i didn't had so much trouble with controls and didn't encounter such bugs. The main difference from AC2, which even reflected in the title, is the ability to hire and train your own assasins's guild. It might sound cool but de-facto it's just a primitive management minigame plus ability to call your assasins to help you in battle (which is a bit OP).

1. Short, loosely linked, main storyline which ended abruptly with almost no twists. Some part of story doesn't make any common sense. I.e. Cesare killing his father the pope.. like what did he expect to happen if he f*ckin kill his only source of power? The game designer make it dramatic enough, but not if it makes sense at all.
Right after it, most main memories can't even be rejected. You have to accept all the missions, which makes the game runs very fast. Also they did Rodrigo Borgia dirty; that man did literally nothing in the storyline.

2. A very unethical 18 minutes long end credit. Personally I always hated credit. I understand that people involved in the game require recognitions, but that recognition comes in form of the money we paid for the game, not by forcing we - the customers - to wait in front of our PC helplessly for 18 minutes of nothingness. What makes it irritating is that the credit can be made in two columns and in faster pace, but frankly, it is not.

3. Many gameplay outside the Animus (that is, playing Desmond and not Ezio) have minimum to no clue/command of what to do at all. I.e. when exploring Colloseum or when Desmond holds the apple.",1616843666,1616843666,False,0,0,0.466439157724380493,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is like AC2 but a lot more fun. Chaining kills together makes combat new and the brutal finishers and use of ranged weapons really make combat entertaining. Unfortunately, it is the targets in Brotherhood that I find to be severely lacking. The exceptions to this are the characters Cesare, Lucrezia, and Rodrigo. Every target on the banner or cover art are unmemorable and boring with missions like regular Assassination Contracts.  Brotherhood also has a short story compared to others and has a lot of side quests, things to collect and rebuild through the game which can get tedious. 

This game is the first to introduce secondary objectives during memory sequences which can be completed on the first try most of the time.

During my playthrough on PC I experienced two issues worth noting. There is an FPS drop at random times. This did not impact my gameplay, so I played through the entire game without feeling a need to resolve them. The other issue I experienced was in the War Machine mission Flying Machine 2.0. In this mission the bomber would freeze in midair and not turn, making it impossible to finish the mission. To fix the turning I had to adjust my resolution to 60Hz. However, I was still experiencing the bomber freeze mid air making me an easy target. I concluded that the bomber would freeze if I went too high. The solution then is simple, fly below the ceiling. With that plan and my new monitor resolution, I had no issues completing the mission for 100% synch.
Overall, the gameplay makes for an incredibly fun game, but the story is a great support to AC2 instead of its own great story.",1616562119,1616562119,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

Assassins' Creed Brotherhood is the sequel and second installment of the Ezio Trilogy. First things first, one of aspects this game improves from the last game is the combat. The combat is an early version of the free flow style combat and one of the main fun factors of the games. After defeating an enemy, you can immediately chain the killing to another enemy if uninterrupted. Some enemies are weak or immune to the weapons Ezio is using so you have to think more then just going brrr.

The story for me is felt shorter than the last game, but this is mainly because the last game took place at many locations, but Brotherhood only takes place in Rome. Although short, the world is huge and fun to explore. Ubisoft is really a master when it comes to world design and Rome in Brotherhood is one of the ones that are craftly well done and I never got bored of venturing it.

The main villain which is based on the historical, real-life Ceaser Borigia, is one of the best villains in AC. The actor really gave it it all. Ezio the main character is an experienced assassin and more mature than the last game. Also the modern day stuff is equally good as the main one. This is the good ol days where the modern portion of the game is good and not how it is now. 

Sidequests are the same like the last one, chores to do if you wanna do, mainly if you one some more activities. But there are some extra missions which I discovered lately after finishing the main story which explores some more of Ezio's past in the last game. These missions really gives some more depth to the character and I really hope its not optional knowing that it really gives some flavour to Ezio's journey.

Overall, I'm reviewing this as a sequel and not a standalone since thats the reason why I'm playing it. But for those who just play games for brrrr disregarding the past games will have fun in this title. The world and combat is one of the best if not the best in the Assassins Crred franchise.

If you like the older Assassin's Creed games this is one of the best, with minimal bugs/polishing issues that are VERY common in later games. Story is kinda meh because it's the middle of a trilogy and doesn't resolve the main conflict (although the end setpiece is pretty cool). Performance was solid, graphics are dated but look very nice in the city/night areas, and voice acting is top notch. Parkour is okay, classic AC (Ezio will frustrate very often), combat is VERY basic but isn't always a breeze. Too many trailing missions in the second half of the game and not enough assassinations would be my main complaint.

AC: Brotherhood is an incredible game for AC standards and has all the positives of AC2, with some improvements. Rome is truly one of the most beautiful settings in the history of videogames and I loved to immerse myslf within it. The characters, the villains... they were all endearing and interesting and after many months I still remember them very well.

Also this has one of the better AC DLCs

As is a given in AC2, there were some bugs and FPS drops (on a gaming computer that can run Arkham Knight on ultra lmao), but usually nothing a quick restart wouldn't fix.

So what did I mean when I said I don't really get the hype, since I have been so positive so far? Well, to many, this is THE Assassin's Creed game. The best one, the top of the notch, the peak of the series. I didn't really feel that. This game is basically just a copycat of AC2 with a slightly smoother gameplay and more features (which sounds good on paper but felt cheap to me), but I felt like that magic from 2 was slightly lost. To me, the beginning on Ezio's story is still the better title.

Put graphics on max.
Cap it at 60fps to avoid weird shit from happening.

Random crashing every now and then but not frequent at all in my 45 hours it probably happened 4 times and I lost little to no progress.

 This game is essentially AC 2 but more polished with new features, if you liked that one you'll probably like this one, most of what was in that game is also here for the most part. This game can get a bit repetitive but that can be said for most assassin's creed games. The story and characters are written fairly well, nothing you can't poke holes in, but good enough to get you invested. The combat is really easy in this game, but at least it's not tedious like in AC 2. The stealth is kinda bear bones, but it gets the job done for the most part. The parkour in this game is pretty good if a tad slow, it can still be satisfying to climb tall buildings with it though. As a whole the gameplay is a bit slow paced, that's not a bad thing but it might bore some.

As you may have noticed you can crank all the graphics to the max with this game. When it is fully cranked it is the remastered version on console basically. You save all your stuff from AC 2 and then you lose all of it so don't get your hopes up. There is special armor you can unlock with 6 keys at the end from the lairs. The armor doesn't play as big of a role at the end like AC 2 but is still really cool and the lairs are fun to figure out. You can't see the last one till sequence 8. Recruiting assassins is an amazing feature and I enjoyed using it. The missions are fairly straight forward. I only encountered one bug and that was climbing the second siege tower at the very end of the game. Don't worry this is a common bug. All I had to do was exit the game. Go back in and climb the second siege tower again. When you walk down the path once you climb the siege tower do not run. It should then be alright. I am really enjoying the Assassins Creed series and I totally recommend this game. I got it on sale and it was a great deal for sure. It took me the total 16ish hours to beat the main story and do all the lairs however time may vary depending on the individual. There is plenty of side missions to do as well once you finish the game. Quick warning the credits at the end are 18 minutes so if you want to wait to the end you should probably find something to do while the credits role. Hope you all have fun and hopefully this was helpful.,1612066722,1612066859,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story continues Ezio's quest for revenge over his family's murders at the hands of a certain someone (the pope), which leads him into some rather trepid waters. Luckily for him, in this game he CAN swim. The story continues pretty much on from the exact moment the last game ended, so the two games should really be looked as one story told over three games (AC 2, AC: Brotherhood, and AC: Revelations). Part 2 of Ezio's saga delivers, but (depending on who you ask) - it never manages to live up to the freshness and originality of its predecessor. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Even though it utilizes the good old ""protagonist finally hits his objective but then loses everything having to restart"" cliché I personally think it manages to pull it off convincingly so it doesn't bother me too much. 
It expanded on the ""upgrading shops"" mechanic introduced in the previous installment by expanding the number of shops available.
It also introduced a completely new mechanic in which you can recruit citizens and evolve them into full fledged assassins allowing you to build your own Brotherhood and even call for help in a fight leading to some incredible fighting sequences.
The main drawback I found with this game was the city. Not the design but the fact that you're always in Rome. There's no Firenze, no Venice. It's always Rome, although the city is amazing and the Coloseum especially looks fantastic.

----------------

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood continues from where you left off in the previous instalment, and introduces many new gameplay aspects to virtually the same game. Towers, guilds and various UI improvements make this game truly different to its predecessors. However, story elements seem rushed and often misplaced, allowing for it to ruin the main overall experience of the game.
The first 6 chapters are fairly boring, with the only standout being the first, where the villain is introduced. After that you go to Rome... and build a brotherhood. This lasts until chapter 7 when the game finally gets interesting and enjoyable, with clearly the majority of the story intended for the end.
Graphics are surprisingly good and the controls do not feel sluggish, and this time Ubisoft went out of their way to actually make a PC version, not a console port like the last two.
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood gets a 6/10.

这一代和2代是《刺客信条》系列很好的开始。我主张想体验全套《刺客信条》的玩家跳过1代，直接从2代上手，若想了解剧情1代可以云通关。因为1代剧情实在是做得太单调。2代的解谜很大程度上奠定了AC系列的价值观，远比1代要丰满。而此代的解谜则是以裂缝的方式继承了下来。后面几作由于基础已经奠定便没有这种历史全局的梳理了。
主剧情丰满且易懂，“兄弟会”的设定也是很经典。本作还引入了完全同步的新设定，为想完美体验《刺客信条》的玩家提高了难度。不过恶名昭著的一点是育碧异想天开搞了个本地存档。我这么长的完美游戏时间有一部分是因为之前打到一半的存档没了，又重头打了一遍。好在育碧之后不这么干了。
最后说一下几个完美游戏比较难且留给我较深印象的点吧。我也是翻了一些攻略，在此分享给大家：

达·芬奇的坦克：这个绝对是最痛苦的。要单纯说难度可能没有轰炸机炸掉信使那里难，可是轰炸机没打到直接失去同步重新开始打信使的小目标，而坦克无伤是完美同步条件，无法读取临近截点，只能从堡垒潜入从头再来，太考验人耐性了！心得是敏捷的走位比打炮更重要，因为无论是炮台还是移动靶坦克，你的射速是远远超过他们的。在他们的准星对准之前一定要快躲，注意前面坦克撞山是不费血的。等我打了有十来次终于完美同步的时候，心砰砰跳！

虚拟训练：说来可能有点丢人，我100%完美同步之后虚拟训练跑酷第一关都过不去……原来我受到了一个误导。在从高台平稳降落到桥洞里的时候，自由奔跑应该是右键+W而不按空格，只在起跳的时候按一下空格。诀窍是把他想像成从高台上直接下落，只不过距离要更超前。当然为了节约时间可以先按空格冲刺一段再松开自由奔跑，再按一下空格起跳。起跳位置必须卡准，要不然会有空气墙bug。不过全虚拟训练金牌后的奖励套装真是够难看的，好像是XCOM里的外星侵略者；

25米高台跳水：我也有一个误区，以为要跳伞，爬了半天圣天使堡发现完成不了（爬圣天使堡另有一个成就）。只要在刺客据点顶处的鸟瞰点找准时机按W+右键+空格即可，这时候会提示空格表示dive；

用弩箭杀死20个岗哨守卫不被发现：我原来以为是哨塔队长，其实不是，探完全图后也没有这样的记忆。解决方法是读取序列3·2，即清掉佣兵总部旁边的哨塔的任务。用袖剑杀死队长后招募附近的一队妓女，让他们引诱原地不动的小兵，这时候直接拿弩箭杀他也不会有读条。不过我之前把附近的小队设成了佣兵，虽然也可以完成任务不触发读条，但他们会和我抢经验……

Strong-arm，即用烟雾弹、长枪和重武器10m之外砸中守卫：这个我也不知道怎么弄，试了很多次后很幸运地完成了……长枪还老也刺不中/砸中路人……看攻略说有一种重武器可能会有bug，换一种重武器即可。",1610888247,1610892605,True,6,4,0.542460024356842041,1,True,False,False

AC: Brotherhood felt better than AC2 at the beggining of the game, and at the end it still feels like it. If you're starting out AC franchise, start either AC2 or AC1. ACB or ACR are follow ups of AC2.

PROS:

+ Combat wise, it just got a lot better, you can now chain kills while coutering aswell and it feels good;
+ Most notably improvement is the controls, finnaly I can jump to where I intended to and not randomly falling to my death to a place I didn't want even want to jump to;
+ Story started off good, eventually mid term got boring restoring your powers once again and eventually it ended up well;
+ You can now recruit Assassins, send them on missions while they level up, get stronger, rewarding you money and items;
+ Flag and Feather Maps make it so much easier, though only knew about this later on as I was avoiding picking up collectibles and leaving it to after I beated the game;
+ More weapons and ways to kill your enemies;
+ Cool outfits such as ""Raiden"";
+ Sidequests and collectibles got more rewarding again.

CONS: 

- Gettings Full Sync on some quests is so frustating, and they don't even give you a checkpoing on it, sometimes you have to restart the whole memory so further back it's annoying, aside it's removing you the option to play the game whatever way you want it because it will feel you're missing out on stuff if you don't full sync;
- Multiplayer doesn't work for me, getting kicked out by anti-cheat; EDIT: It works when you google punkbuster and install the program, at least on ACR worked, can't confirm for ACB but should be the same;
- Riding a horse through the map feels slower than the previous game;
- Tailing or following people is just utterly boring, not to mention if something goes wrong or you fail full sync, you have to go through it again, tedious process;
- The horse doesn't jump small terrains or over stuff at all, aside from a few fences;
- Unskipable credits at the end of the game, seriously lol;
- Unskipable cutscenes;
- PC port doesn't have the achievements, though it shows up when you earn them, you can't check them.

FINAL VERDICT

Full sync removes the overral fun of the game, gameplay is improved and it's fun, story-wise is still recommended.",1545774554,1610765537,True,3,0,0.53071671724319458,0,True,False,False

Just when we thought it couldn’t get any better…

Some key points that this game offers:

1.	Massive New Open World
2.	Incredible beauty
3.	Recruit Assassin’s
4.	New Gameplay Mechanics
5.	New Weapons and Gear

Gameplay & Controls:

The controls for the game have been updated slightly to offer us new and improved handling of Ezio. However, it was done in such a way that there is no confusion or difficulty adjusting to the new scheme. Ezio still handles just as beautifully as before, smooth and on point, whether you are chasing down an escaping target, or preying on a soon to be assassinated target! The experience isn’t just amazing it is new and enhanced.

We have some new weapons that have joined our arsenal. Poison, a one handed crossbow along with a variety of new weapons and gear that can be acquired throughout the game. Numerous additional side quests and extra activities have also been added to the game to enhance the experience.

Work closer together with your allies than ever before as you help them build up their guilds by doing unique quests for them. Shops can be bought and reopened all over Rome as you take down Borgia's influence. These shops then can be used to buy and equip you with numerous gear as you unlock them. Some shops also offer quests that will reward you with unique weapons or gear pieces upon completion. 

As an added extra, you can rebuild certain sections of Rome as well. This enhances the experience drastically and increases the beauty that is the AC Brotherhood. You literally take Rome back one block at a time from the Borgia. The journey is truly incredible.

The trailer took us by surprise when we saw Ezio taking on the Borgias singlehandedly and when things looked dire, we saw that he was not alone… Recruit and train your own assassins this time around. As Borgia's influence is taken down you will unlock recruiting missions. Train these Assassins and as they go up in rank, so do their prowess… Never struggle alone again with them at your side!

The story is bigger and the threat greater than ever before! The new mechanics and new gear open up so many possibilities to get to your target and take them down. 

Graphics:

A massive step up from ACII. ACII was beautiful do not get me wrong, but Brotherhood received some nifty improvements. Textures are cleared and the lighting has also been improved. Building architecture is another marvel with every building looking fantastic. 

The day and night cycles are just as beautifully implemented with the shadow rendering doing an amazing job again this time around. Character modelling is simply amazing. There are so many faces, so many appearances and they all look unique down to the last dress.

Cinematics are an absolute blast to experience. Very art like and the colour variations are great.

Sounds:

Nothing makes a Legendary sequel even more so than a masterfully crafted soundtrack. That is what we have here! Every tune enhances every aspect of the game tenfold… Whether you are in the heat of battle fighting for your life, or stealthily stalking your prey, the soundtrack will bring the experience to life tenfold!

Background sounds do just as much by bringing all the little things to life and utterly making this an unforgettable experience. Voice over artists did an impeccable job bringing their characters to life with some amazing voice over work and the scripts were created just as beautifully.

Replayability:

Brotherhood is the first game that offers us multiplayer. There are eight different game modes to try out. We have Wanted, Alliance, Manhunt, Chest Capture, Advanced Wanted, Advanced Alliance, Escort, and Assassinate. Multiplayer also comes with its own levelling system that will get you new perks and abilities as you level up.

The singleplayer campaign itself also offers a lot of replay value. There is a lot of additional activities to partake in; From side quests to rebuilding Rome and collecting treasures and other trinkets. This alone will keep you occupied for a few days.

MGR Gaming’s Conclusions:
Spoilers Ahead:

AC2 blew us out of the water by being an insanely great sequel to an already great game. Here comes Brotherhood and it does just that again. Ubisoft did something great with these games, and just like myself, many of us simply can’t get enough of these games.

The new mechanics and weapons are great! That crossbow really is a game changer that quickly helps you even the odds, then there are those recruits of yours. They take the entire game and enhance the potential and outcome immensely. Every hunt or quest that allows for them, is so much more unique with new methods to go about completing your mission. This new addition is an absolute marvel.

The story line is just as mysterious yet still so captivating and alluring… One thing that they made sure of is that every little aspect of Brotherhood will be a step up from ACII, they did this rather perfectly…

Multiplayer is a neat add on if you are keen to take on other Assassins. There is an abundance of game modes to try out and it comes with its own levelling system too. There is more, but I suggest you get this marvel and try it out for yourself.

Brotherhood continues the Story of Ezio Auditore, an Italian with well-earned title of a master Assassin, set in a new city Roma.
-
It is without a doubt that Ezio's character charms are still very much present in this sequel. Brotherhood's story is a continuation, but also a self-contained one. So if you haven't played AC2 but want to play Brotherhood now, I'd say you can go ahead, you'll still have a good time. But it better to get familiarized with the characters from AC2 because they're making their returns in this one.
There are a lot of interesting missions in Brotherhood, full with wacky-unexpected objectives and segments.
-
As for gameplay, Brotherhood plays like 2 but with some quality of life changes.
The biggest change is combat, you can now chain your killing move on to the next enemies, meaning if you get the counter timing right, fights can end in seconds. Still, the clunkiness of old AC combat still persist here, and running away from enemies is a valid option for an assassin.
As the name suggest, Brotherhood features a new feature that lets you recruit new assassins, train them, and call them to help in a variety of supports.
Old features make their returns too, such as social blending and hiring different factions to help you. Double assassinations and climb leap return, but as upgrades that you buy later on in the game.
-
As for the world and openworld checklist, Brotherhood strikes a good balance. You don't have to collect certain collectibles (unlike in AC2) to complete the story. Despite that, openworld activities have enough variations in them to keep them interesting as you grdually explore and open up the map. The spaces in Roma were well utilized too. There are some open spaces for you to ride horses and nothing else, but most of the time you're doing missiosn in the city area, jumping from rooftops to rooftops, it's the classic AC gameplay.

Brotherhood is one of the former, and I was pleased to find that a lot of the pleasant memories I had of it were just as fun to play through a second time. What I can't remember is if my original playthrough was plagued by issues as it was this time. Some cutscenes really suffer from issues, like characters getting stuck or clipping right through things. Sometimes while just running around, textures wouldn't render quite right or NPCs would just drop in from out of nowhere. Guards would not be visible but I'd suddenly be getting noticed by a stray warning indicator with no body under it. Weird stuff that made me lose some of the immersion I had with AC2. I also had some issues with the environment itself. Much of the city works well and has the layout that you need to fly above on rooftops, never touching the ground and feeling like you're really Ezio. But the open countryside, while beautiful, does nothing for me. It's too big to comfortably/quickly traverse on foot, but too layered to work with a horse. I'll run up while on a horse and he just stops suddenly in front of a tiny step up or down, instead of jumping. It makes all of that area borderline infuriating to work your way through. 

Aside from the above problems, I will say the story still really holds up. Ezio's journey continues in a logical way and makes use of characters we met in the previous installment of the series. New weapons are interesting to play through and the killstreaks make fighting a little more enjoyable. Unlike the previous iteration's annoying feathers, there are treasure chests, Borgia flags, and a smaller batch of 10 feathers to collect. The wonderful part is that you can buy maps that show you where all of those items are, so you won't be glued to somebody's terrible Youtube guide that barely shows you where the collectibles actually are. The Borgia towers are a fun element that let you make use of your learned stealth skills or your fearless fighting. The story itself is shorter, both in Ezio's world and Desmond's, but I think that allows for more quality in the content. Overall, I really enjoyed it. 

As with the previous games, I think this is absolutely worth playing through if you're a fan of the series or just interested in it. The AC series has really changed the game (no pun intended) in how games are created. The clumsier aspects from the original AC have been refined only two games in, so I'm excited to tackle the next game and feel the smoother and more elegant controls.",1609733668,1609733668,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The crossbow, faster pistol, throwable smoke bombs, the parachute, the lifts, the updated grappling mechanics, combo kills, heavy weapons - all of them make this game an ultimate sandbox that is a pleasure to toy with. 

Ezio ending sucks. The apple gameplay sucks. Cesare bossfight is as bad AC2 Maestro bossfight. Desmond Coliseum ending is pretty cool though.

The side content is mostly good now in comparison to AC2:
 ⁃ Templar agents (Killing characters from multiplayer - nice touch)
 ⁃ Rome renovation
 ⁃ Assassin recruits leveling
 ⁃ Subject 16 rifts
 ⁃ Leonardo's War Machines
 ⁃ Cristina memories (although 75% Total Sync requirement for last mission is bad since after 65% the content drops in quality)
 ⁃ Guild missions
 ⁃ Scrolls of Romulus
 ⁃ Da Vinci Disappearance DLC
Bad:
 ⁃ Flags, chests and feathers
 ⁃ Optional 100% synchronization objectives
 ⁃ Guild challenges
 ⁃ Courtesan and thief guild missions, mercenary guild assassinations
 ⁃ Copernicus DLC
This is the Assassin's Creed that starts to overindulge in trailing missions. 
The game feels even more bloated than previous entries. Yet, it's a solid contender for title of ""Best Assassin's Creed Of All"".

Too often you get a large area with a target but are forced by checkpoints to take a certain route. The DNA then wants to push you even more to turn off your head and creativity. Thus, some sections degenerate into unfair and stupid CoD stealth passages, where a small misclick means the end. The climbing passages are similarly good or bad as in the predecessor. Sometimes you get stuck on edges or Ezio jumps 90° in the wrong direction. All this together can make the game very frustrating, which I didn't find so bad in the predecessor.

AC:Brotherhood took me less time to finish the story than in AC2. New moves & actions are now available but some new things made me bored like renovating places in Rome, finishing shop quests that will really take heavy loads of time and looting treasures for shop quests (items that are very rare). THE COOL PART is you can raise a brotherhood of assassins and send them to missions, give them contracts, and even call for their help when assassinating. In the Uplay website, there is a thing called ""actions & rewards"" and by doing these actions in the game, you will earn credits and you'll be able to unlock rewards such as the character for multi-player, single-player costumes, etc. The environment looks very nice, and it's somehow near to realistic.The ending will surely tell you whether there will be a next series of AC or not, so buy it now! it's really worth it. In addition, there is a multi-player wherein you'll be needing an internet connection. the concept is about, assassinating each other, testing your assassin skills, blending with other people to cover your identity, etc. You'll be earning experience and level up, unlock new skills and new costume colors. the bad part is... it will take you about 10 minutes just to complete the player slots and start the game but sometimes it's really fast.",1607199913,1608984426,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However that doesn't mean it's not fair to criticism. Some of it's climbing sections in the country are a little bizarre in that you cant really climb up some of them, it does improve on the free running aspect but some of the mountain areas can't really be scaled. I encountered a number of different issues on PC compared to the console release. None were game breaking. The games story is shorter than i remember, it goes by quite quick, so you have to spend time exploring the world and doing the side tasks the game provides to you. I love the story even if it is over reaching at times, but where the game shines is all the side missions and activities that it provides. Building the creed from recruits you find after burning down towers is so much fun. It's like the game wants you to have multiple tasks happening while you're exploring the world. The combat I would say improved upon in the sense that they made it a little more fluent but also easier. Execution streaks are a thing and after the first enemy you kill in combat, you can kill any other enemy around you in one hit. Which can actually be quite fun if you know how to do it right. Rome is a fantastic setting, it has all the landmarks and the historical significance with all the flash and scenery of an Assassins Creed game. The secret armour you get in this one is cool, but it's not as unique as the Altair armour of 2, and doesn't look as great. If you're looking to pick it up on PC and have it on console, I wouldn't spend the money, I for one have it and wanted to play it on PC to see the enhanced resolution and graphics compared to my old 360. And in all fairness it does look quite nice in 4K. But, like i stated before, I encountered a number of new glitches and the odd crash that I would never get on console. If you're looking to experience the best that Assassins Creed has to offer and don't mind the dated mechanics of two previous game generations, then I cant recommend this enough.

This game continues the storyline of Ezio Auditore while at the same time improving the game mechanics and story quality. I believe that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is better than it's predecessor as the game not only improved parkour and easier combat but also a new feature where you can call upon recruited assassins and the economic system is on a lager scale. The graphics are also improved in comparison to Assassin's Creed 2. Unfortunately the game still uses earlier features like treasure chests, feathers and flags which is very frustrating for 100% completion. Personally I like that this game limits its map to one city as it then allows for more focus in said city, Rome. Other than that there is not much to say as the game is quite familiar to Assassin's Creed 2 with a few improvements and a slightly more interesting story.

Strengths:
- In AC2, there was symbols for options but they fix it in this game. They added keyboard. 
- You make your own assassins, and then you send them to the tasks, and this make me feel so strong as Ezio.
- You can play as Ezio one more time.
- You see Desmond's life more than AC2, because you can leave the animus. There is an option about this.

Weaknesses:
- Story is too short considering AC2. 
- In the end, you do not understand what is going on exactly. At least I felt this way.

This game is not good as AC2 but without comparison these two game, AC: Brotherhood is a good game that worth its price and time. If you love AC series (1 and 2) you should take this one too.

Poorly done pc porting, with certain mission require to enable vsync to properly work then the said vsync cause frame dropping massively.

From the story telling, to the side-quests - it's always immersive. The only problem I found during gameplay are controlls.

Then I started playing this game, I never thought how deep the story goes, not only building the characteristics in the sequinces of our ancestors but also the story in the real world of Assassin's Creed. The game is set in 2012 where Desmond Milles and hes companions are escaping the templar order to manage continue their adventure of finding ""Peace of the Eden"" - commonly known as - ""Apple of Eden"", that can control human minds and thoughts. If you never played Assassin's Creed games before and you care about the story, you need to play this game from the begining of Assassin's Creed 1 to fully understand what's going on.

From the gameplay perspective it's vast and there are lot of things you can do. It is almost 40 hours of normal gameplay if you're trying to achieve 100% completion, not including the multiplayer. I didn't play it a lot because it's hard to find servers these days.

You may ask, why I love old AC games, but not the new ones. This is because, it has much more deeper story telling than the newer ones. This mainly focus on the templar and assassin order plots, how they were created in the first place, what is their purpose and why are they seeking for humanity control, where the others just focus on the gameplay and random killings and some sorf of RPG elements that were never should been implomented in AC universe.

I would recommend this game for true Assassin's Creed fans because it's still holds up to this game as a best AC game there was, in terms of story and the gameplay wise. Zoomers should stay away from these games and play newer additions.

This game is an absolute blast! I'm having the time of my life playing the second game to Ezio's journey. I really adored the second game to Assassin's Creed and this one took me on an even bigger adventure. Being introduced to Ezio for the first time in Assassin's Creed II and falling absolutely IN LOVE with the development of his character, the premise of the game during the Italian Renaissance and how interactive the game was (especially through combat, quests and places to explore), I immediately got addicted and hooked on the gameplay of AC II and didn't expect to get more in Brotherhood. 

I've fallen in love with the methods of assassination in Brotherhood, and as a fan of a notable series in video games known for their stealth + action heavy-like combat such as 'Dishonored', diversity and variety is what I really cherish most. Brotherhood brought me Dishonored memories as well actually but never having experienced the Assassin's Creed series before until this year starting from the beginning with Altair, I'm very glad to have chosen Ezio as one of my favourite assassin's so far. 

This game is just packed with interesting stories, so much to do, and although it can be a lot at times (especially as somebody who likes getting to see everything via viewpoints and accomplishing all completion of renovations and buildings), it's a lot to take in but it's all worth it in the end. 

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is just an amazing addition to Ezio's story after II, and it's very convenient that it kicks off right at the bat at the end of the second game as if no time had ever skipped. I'm genuinely surprised that conducting leap of faiths, running away from dozens of enemies, looking for creative methods to blend in and finding ways to stay undetected is just phenomenal. 

I really hope Ubisoft finds a way to bring back what was once a great series back to its feet. I have not played Odyssey or Valhalla yet, but the reviews have changed from person to person, almost split in half for me. I'm not sure this opinion will stay the same once I get my hands on those games, but I do hope Ubisoft can bring back what Ezio introduced as one of the greatest Assassin's in Assassin's Creed.

Brotherhood is a direct sequel to II. So much so, in fact, that Brotherhood picks up literally the moment at which II ends. Beyond its story, though, it makes a number of drastic improvements on its predecessor. Most notably is that it runs a bit better. Assassin's Creed II has an unfortunate, persistent stutter, in addition to effects pop-in that really draws back from the experience. Brotherhood still features these issues, but they are much fewer and further between, suggesting a bit of massaging of Ubi's Anvil engine between games. This is in addition to having higher resolution textures and better lighting effects in general. It doesn't feature the abundantly thick atmosphere and filters of AC2, but I chalk that up to taste, anyway. 

In addition to the graphical and stability improvements, free running animations are much more expedient, and free running in general is much more polished. I notice myself being frustrated with free running gaffes such as making the jump in a wrong direction, or getting stuck on geometry, far less frequently than I ever did with AC2, which could have me singing curses at it when a free running oddity would ruin an assassination approach. Brotherhood seems to have fixed the majority of that wonkiness.

Combat is also revamped in a huge way here. AC2's combat felt clunky, slow, too sticky, and plagued by a poor camera. Everything is streamlined here to great effect. Proper counters, a bevy of tools at Ezio's disposal, and unbelievably slick animation work leads to the new chain-killing feature being extremely satisfying to execute and really making you feel how much of a master combatant Ezio has come since his youth, running across Florence's rooftops to try and get it in with some rich noble dude's wife.

The focus on just a single city is a huge boon for this series, too. There were far too many viewpoints to hit in AC2, and they dragged the pacing out and felt like busywork. The half-dozen areas in AC2 only added to this—most people fondly remember Florence and Venice, but Romagna and San Gimignano are both forgettable at best and only serve to take the spotlight from the better areas. Brotherhood doesn't suffer from this: Rome is front-and-center, sprawling, and it feels far more realized than either Florence or Venice did in AC2, and lacks none of their incredible atmosphere. I also loved this aspect of Unity and Syndicate, and I do hope Ubisoft considers doing a single-city game again in the future. I really feel it lets them stretch their legs and add an appropriate amount of depth that a major European city like Rome, Paris, or London deserves. I don't think it's a coincidence that these three settings are my favorites in the series! But, I digress. Back to Brotherhood...

While I've never considered the stories to be the main draw in any of the AC games, Brotherhood's is easily the peak of the series. The effortless banter, great dialogue, and some of the voice performances (Nolan North as Desmond and Kristen Bell as Lucy are spectacular whenever they're quipping back-and-forth) really carry a lot of the experience here. It also starts with a bang (literally). Each time I replay this game (on console in the past) I always find it hard to put it down until I get through the beginning, because it's such a satisfying roller coaster ride and an apt love letter to Assassin's Creed II, before it moves on to become its own thing.

I'd also be remiss not to mention my favorite feature in this game—indeed, probably my favorite feature in any Assassin's Creed game! The Assassin bureau management system and all the perks that come with it are insanely addictive (I once played this game for 19 hours straight back in 2011. Don't judge me. I pay my taxes, alright?). It's so freaking cool to put it to use, too. Recruiting assassin apprentices, sending them out on missions and leveling them up, and then seeing them in action in-game when you call them in to take out a few guards or help you out in a fight is just so damned cool. You are basically summoning an Ezio from the first game to swoop in and stealthily dispatch an enemy. It's always so slick and it never gets old. You instantly feel like chief of the bad-asses each time you do it, and it makes you want to continue going back to the bureaus to level them up some more. Having a full set of master assassins on hand in the late-game to help you out at any time by silently dispatching enemies in front of you as you make your way towards your target is just the coolest thing I've ever done in an Assassin's Creed game. And engaging in an all-out street war with you, your assassins, and a dozen guards is just always so cool. Gunshots ringing, clashing steel. Man, it really never does get old. This game's almost 10 years old and it's still so much fun!

If there is something bad to say about Brotherhood, it's probably that the stupid flying machine level, which is truly awful and frustrating garbage—easily the low point of Brotherhood. The thing controls so terribly, it's just unreal that it even made it into the game. Or, a more general flaw, that this game is just too damn easy. Wiith Ezio's new arsenal, his spectacular countering and chain-killing abilities, it's never been easier to simply carve your way through a dozen enemies with ease. Factor in being able to summon your own assassins to pick off enemies, and much of the game becomes trivial to conquer. But that's how I like my open world games, if I'm being honest; beautifully realized, fun to look at and explore, and just a pleasure to [i]exist[/i] in. I don't really pick up open world titles for a challenge, I pick them up to veg out, hit map markers, and discover cool stuff. And in that, Brotherhood succeeds in spades.

I love this game, man! Assassin's Creed Brotherhood kicks ass. It's the best the Assassin's Creed series has ever been. But you've definitely got to play Assassin's Creed II, first, to fully appreciate what Brotherhood does so well.

The story continues a few years after you left it off in the previous game, takes you to a different city and different locations. These are beautiful and well made. 
Graphics also get minor improvements.

Gameplay sees many improvements and is great.
Combat gets a huge improvement with the addition of the combo kills. Basically you turn into a beast of a fighter, and it is a massive satisfaction to see your character standing on top of 20 corpses that you killed. Great fun to be had. 

Collectables are gradually increasing, as well as getting the new ""renovations"" throughout Rome. Took me 18 hours to complete with everything in it.

Parkour: mostly ok, but when you chase someone and you spend several seconds just climbing the last part of a ledge, or you you're trying to drop down and you need to press shift 15 times to drop 3 meters, then it's very frustrating.

Combat. Often VERY annoying. For example, in sequence 4, you're told to use space to kick. The ONLY thing that does in this fight, is making the enemies jump a little backwords. So you end up pulling out either the gun or the crossbow just becuase the ""intended"" way doesn't work.

Moving, etc. VERY often your toon won't do what you're trying to, or will do something else. It doesn't make it better that some actions have the same button, for example press shift to carry a body, or hold shift to loot. Besides, I'm so used to using the shift button to run in other games, that I often end up stopping (often in the middle of a fight) to carry a corpse instead of running.

I do love the way you improve/rebuild Rome and increase your income by doing so. Though upgrading the blacksmith, bank, etc could use a better explanation on how it works.

Side quests. Mostly ridiculous and too easy. For example, you're supposed to deliver letters to some npcs within a timer, and the timer is shorter if you're going for 100% sync. This is simply running from A to B, noting more to it. Or the Borgia camps with their tower - kill the boss, then ignite the tower. I did a level 5 difficulty (""hard"") camp very early in the game, I could barely believe how easy it was.

Bugs/glitches. Haven't really seen any, except from one. I did a mission in sequence 4, and was told to not lose more than 10 blocks (or whatever it's called) of health to get 100% sync. After losing 2, I got a message that 100% sync failed.

What works is fun. But the annoyances are too many and to severe to fully enjoy the game. Which is why I do not recommend it.",1399568795,1603211868,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Brotherhood definitely has the feel of a game that was rushed out of production too soon.  In my recent playthrough I crashed 5 times, and encountered several other non-game breaking bugs as well.  Parts of the gameplay and storyline really felt rushed, disconnected, and unsatisfying.

All that said Brotherhood also has some of the most entertaining gameplay in the series and some really bright spots in the plotline.  While many of the main story portions felt like brief errands, there were also some story missions that were just incredible.  The often buggy side missions (and their sometimes highly frustrating full sync objectives) at times disguised some immensely entertaining gameplay.  Although the enemies you face are definitely upgraded from AC 2, AC Brotherhood gives players a wide variety of effective ways to deal with them.  Ironically you feel too OP in Brotherhood, but then at least you can pick and choose how you want to approach combat.

The game ends on a massive cliffhanger, which normally would be a downer but given that we don't have to wait to jump into AC Revelations as soon as we finish Brotherhood it's not really a big deal.  The later portions of the main story are excellent.  There is a bit more of an emphasis on grinding through side activities though, so if that's not your thing you may enjoy this title less.  Personally I found liberating zones, recruiting and training assassins, taking down war machines and the like a ton of fun.  It feels like a shame that more recent AC titles don't have assassin recruits (even if they make you way too OP), liberation zones and city renovations.",1602845085,1602845085,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story starts off following the the ending of AC II (highly recommend playing II first), and recaps some of it's events to help refresh the player on what's going on. We then skip to Modern Day which takes place in Monteriggioni and later on continue on Ezio's Journey to Rome in which the player is now free to explore albeit with some restrictions until you progress through the story.

The gameplay is refined in Brotherhood and has a much more fluid combat system, it also introduces optional objectives and adds the ability to summon assassin recruits who you rescue off the streets of Rome, the parkour system still remains the same. Much like it's predecessor it still has a few bugs and some annoying missions.

The online multiplayer is surprisingly still alive but matchmaking may take a while.

Brotherhood's soundtrack reuses some songs from II but the majority are new and are still composed by Jesper Kyd

While the game looks dated to some it still holds up to me.

I'd recommend that you just get the standard edition of Brotherhood, but if you want that 1 skin for Ezio and the OST for Brotherhood, get the Deluxe Edition.

My only major gripe with the game is that you have to have Uplay/Ubisoft Club to run the game, but that's it.",1602712779,1602712779,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Despite some predictable plot points (excluding the present day animus plotline no one cares about) and a few bugs and bad animations that were never patched, this game is still quite fun for me. 

By the end you are extremely overpowered, you have two dozen different ways to kill people. So while it's not challenging anymore to take out a group of guards, you can have lots of fun with the different weapons, or limit yourself to a single kill method for a challenge. It's a power fantasy game where you run around and feel like a badass the whole time.

Combat is fun, not particularly challenging but varied enough to be stimulating and entertaining to watch the animations. Economy is ok, I don't really remember the investment system for the shops, not sure if that is new since I played it when it originally came out, but if you really looking for endgame content for this I suppose you could get into it.

The map and city of Rome is really fun to explore, the landmarks are very cool to see for the first time.

I think this game has probably the best balance of climbing mechanics, the earlier games were not loose enough, but the newer ones in the series are waaaay too forgiving. While you still fly off edges, have some weird ledge grabs, lose your balance and do some janky jumps sometimes, overall the parkour and climbing is very satisfying. Back-ejects and side-ejects are especially really smooth once you master the mechanic. It's still sometimes unrealistic when doing certain manuevers (actually a lot of the manuevers) but fun, that's all I can say.

The first storyline feels like it was written by a pretentious hipster where a couple of teens in a camper van fights a multi billion super evil corporation that is plotting world domination. (scooby doo takes on capitalism) Between missions you get to interact and listen to these people talk. These talks feels like something adults imagine young people talk about. How cool they are and how often they go out. The discussions they have about technology is equally disturbing and quite frankly made me want to turn off the audio.

The other storyline in the distant past feels like a b-movie script where important items are misplaced and super evil villains appear at just the right time with their henchmen. The main character is absurdly dumb and at one point rides of while bleeding from gunshot wounds leaving the safety of his allies to fall flat on his back in the middle of nowhere. I have no idea how they left this in the game.

And the visual stuff really needs some polish too. At one point the main character and his friend is stopped by a metal gate where the gate itself has wide enough gaps to fit through. It's laughable as they discuss how to lift it up. 

The minigames are are not balanced at all and are far too long and repeating. Chasing someone down a hallway is not made more fun by having the 5th identical gate in a row closing in front of you. 

I've encountered several bugs ranging from visual and model issues where the assassin climbs and dismounts invisible objects to coding issues where the game stops working without 60hz on refresh rate.

It also has all the annoyances from the previous games. It's an open world, but it doesn't let you access it from the beginning.

Exploring Rome sent me right back to my childhood. After finally finishing the game, I remember why I loved it so much. 

[h1]What I like:[/h1]

+ The story is brilliant, on par with its predecessor, and the cast of characters, old and new, hold their own and enhance the quality of the narrative. Ezio is more the wiser in this entry and is without a doubt the best character in it. The antagonists are really good as well!

+ The outside animus story is really good as well. Being able to explore Monteriggioni in modern day as well as having conversations with the characters was one of my main childhood memories of this game. Still holds up.  

+ The combat feels a lot more fast paced in comparison to previous entries. You can now chain executions after completing a successful execution. This can also be done with a successful counter. Whilst doing this you have to constantly be aware of your surroundings and be aware of interruptions. It’s quite entertaining, and it looks really cool.

+ The crossbow is a brilliant addition to the game. I normally despise crossbows in video games, but Brotherhood got it perfectly. It’s easy to use and it’s incredibly effective. 

+ The ability to call in other assassins to support in combat is one of the best aspects of this game, and it’s what makes it stand out in the franchise. As you progress, the Brotherhood becomes more and more established as new recruits are added. You can also send them on missions across Europe which level them up and provide you with items and money. 

+ The climbing hasn’t seen much changes, but there are a couple of minor changes and additions that have been made. It’s now easier to jump onto ledges that are parallel to you, and the lifts make it easier for vertical traversing. Other than that, it’s still good.

+ There is a very noticeable visual upgrade from the previous entry, especially in the character models. There’s much more detail and focus. The level design is fantastic as always. You spend the majority of the game in Rome, and it is a brilliant place to explore. 

+  As well as the main story, there are other things you can do. AC: Brotherhood is the first entry in the series to have proper distinct side quests. They’re nothing major, but they’re unique. There are also other story lines to follow such as The Followers of Romulus and learning about Ezio’s ex-lover, all of which are very interesting.

+ Once again, the music for this game is fantastic. Iconic tracks from AC 2 have returned, along with some iconic new tracks that help immerse you into the world. Jesper Kyd is seriously fantastic.

[h1]What I don’t like:[/h1]

- The ending. Assassin’s Creed isn’t really known for having really good endings, and this game is no exception. My problem with it is that it didn’t make much sense to me. It felt way too abrupt. My opinion of this might change as I continue my playthrough of the franchise, but at the moment, I’m just confused. 

- The bugs. Oh, the wonderful bugs. There aren’t loads, but there are a few. Climbing can be a nightmare sometimes. You’ll want to do one thing, but Ezio will want to do another, so there will be times where you’ll have to find a compromise. There’s also a game breaking bug near the end where a crucial cutscene won’t play. Oddly enough, this was fixed by turning V-Sync on. Don’t ask how…

- The air tackle mechanic is stupid and pointless. There were so many times where I wanted to hang off a ledge, but instead Ezio would just jump on top of somebody, forcing me to climb again. It does more harm than good.

[h1]My Overall Thoughts:[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood was the second game I played in the AC franchise, the first being Revelations. It is without a doubt, one of the best games the franchise has to offer. It is the definitive Assassin’s Creed experience in my opinion. Being able to establish and manage the brotherhood of assassins only reinforces it.

I’ve seen people call Brotherhood “an expansion to AC2” or just simply “a big DLC”, and I couldn’t disagree with this statement more. There is more content in Brotherhood, and the mechanics are more refined. I honestly think it’s slightly better than its predecessor. Only slightly.

Although I was taken off guard by the abruptness of the ending, the past games so far have had abrupt endings, so I can’t say I was hugely annoyed by it. At the end of the day, questions usually get answered. Same thing goes for the bugs. They’re there, but they are manageable.

At the moment, Brotherhood stands as my favourite in the franchise. This may change as I replay Revelations, but Brotherhood is something special. It’s less about a character’s journey, and more about something greater. The staple of the franchise. The Brotherhood itself.

There are a few game breaking bugs that require you to change your refresh rate inorder to complete certain missions. If you do not mind working around these and other various minor bugs, then I would say you should get this game. 

Graphics have held up well and the game does not look too bad. 

As for content, if you go for 100% you are gonna get about 50 hours of playtime.  

The story is awesome since it is playing off of AC1 AC2 and continues to AC Revelations.

The open world in the game is definitely bigger than AC II, but feels all the more empty with pointless collectables like flags and feathers. While the Romulus tombs and contract assignments can be fun to attempt, Ubisoft mucks them up with absurd optional objectives that take so much out of the exploration potential with a new full sync model. It's not that later franchises don't pull off the optionals, but Brotherhood's optionals simply mar what could have been a great sequel to Ezio's story. Then, the chance of any redemption is denied by the newly introduced investment economy (which I personally hated), empty side quests like Copernico's and worse stealth mechanic. Moreover, it's not by any measure a great game simply because the franchise has seen better. Here's an overall summary of my experience with the game:

The investment system was fairly easy to use and understand. Assassin recruits were easy to understand, though I wish it were easier to earn XP, for example earning XP when using assassins to kill guards. 
Game mechanics were a tad annoying. The game was lagging every few seconds, which was a common issue among the players as I've read online. 
Fighting the enemies proved itself difficult as some would simply dodge every time I tried to hit them.

I do recommend playing this game, but I am going to focus on some of its flaws for this review:

[u]Gameplay[/u]

The story of AC II continues mostly in Rome, a large scale city that does feel somewhat empty compared to what it has to offer in terms of quests. I guess that is historically accurate, but it leads to a slow mid-game.

You have to remember to synchronize first before burning down a view point, as Ezio will perform an automatic leap of faith and you will have to climb the whole thing again.

Combat is neither interesting or challenging and it is frustrating in three aspects:
* Choosing a particular target for your actions is difficult, as the game actively screws you over by changing your target every few seconds to the now closest valid target. Assassinating someone who stands or walks next to a guard is nigh impossible, not to mention that the game will sometimes cancel your pistol shots after you release the appropriate button.
* Target selection is way too ""magnetic"": If you attempt to disengage, you will not only be fighting guards but also the camera which will try its hardest to not unlock.
* Fighting ranged enemies is kind of awkward, as they will obviously try to keep their distance by repeadedly disengaging. However, the buttons to run and to block are the same and blocking takes priority while you are in a fight. [b]Though you may be able to change this in the game settings,[/b] but I never bothered to check.

Overall, I did enjoy playing this game. The events you encounter are quite varied and can be solved in several ways.

In the end, it took me around [b]25 hours[/b] to complete the main story line. Saves are stored locally and I lost mine half way through.

[u]Technical Issues[/u]

You may notice a lot of FPS stuttering while in game. This is because AC:B will mostly occupy your first CPU core. 

To fix this, open the task manager, click on details and right click on ACBSP.exe. Choose affinity, uncheck all CPU cores but one and click ok. After that, right click again to access the affinity settings and select every core again.

This will fix the FPS issues for your current session.",1594571510,1594571510,True,3,0,0.558801114559173584,0,True,False,False
48190,72546252,76561198170159766,0,92,1804,0,489,1612391364,"This is a very stunning continuation of AC2. Continuing in my HUDless gameplay of the series, I am disappointed that there's a map bug where it fails to update which direction Ezio is facing in the main map if you have the mini-map off. It pretty much defeats the purpose of the kind of playthrough I'm trying to do, but oh well. Once again, like in AC2, I have to base my direction on the shapes of the buildings and paying attention to rooftop shapes as I scale them.

That stupid HUD-less playthrough breaking bug aside, the combat has seen a vast improvement in this instalment. There is now a kill streak mechanic where you buffer your next kill during an animation and once you've got a target locked, they will cease to respond to you. Instead their teammates will come disrupt your flow by either attacking or grabbing you. I like how there's enough different enemy types where not all of them can be countered and killed instantly, some of them require dodging, and some are easier to kill during kill streaks which makes the mechanic feel so rewarding.

The parkour is still just as good as the first two games, except jump grab feels weird now where you have to pause for a moment and THEN press up and the feet button at the same time to make Ezio attempt to grab a higher handhold above him as opposed to being able to hit the feet button any time during your ascent.

The story is still damn good, actually maybe a little better with character interactions that feel more fleshed out and personal instead of being more geared toward serving the plot. The modern timeline is pretty good too, it picks up right where you left off in AC2. This was AC in its prime having the story follow proper continuity both in the historic timeline and the modern timeline.

Definitely recommend this as it is the logical continuation to both Desmond and Ezio's stories, two series main stays who were taken away from us far too soon. Not to mention once again it builds upon the foundation that AC1 laid out and does it a whole lot better. This is probably the best the series has ever been in terms of combat and there has been nothing much like it since.

The game is amazing, very colorful, and alive. Not like the 1st Assassin's Creed. Gorgeous architecture. Feels like you're walking through a real city, it's so alive. People talk to each other, lovers flirt. merchants sell their crafts, musicians play music and thieves hang on the roofs.

Your best friend, Leonardo Da Vinci makes things even more interesting. He makes weapons, gadgets for you, he's also one of the cleverest person in this game. He has made prototypes of a Tank, a Boat with something like a fucking AA gun, a flying shooting beast, a cart with AA gun and the missions with them are amazing, different and very interesting. 

There are adventure missions, which is one of the best things in this game and the 2nd one. ""The Lair of Romulus"", very interesting missions and great story about the Followers of Romulus.

Borgia Towers... An amazing feature. This thing is like a fucking outpost. That's all i can say about it, 10/10
Assassination Contracts- these ones make you feel like an assassin the most.
Recruiting assassins- a cool feature that was added, making the creed, a real creed.
Ability to redo missions- something that is missing in the previous games. Now you're going for a full synchronization which is not that hard because the story is shorter.

The things I don't like are:
-short story
-useless collectables-feathers and flags

That's all. As you can see, there are only 2 things I don't like so I am now free to say that I highly recommend this game. Don't skip.Buy now. Do it for Ezio's brothers and dad. R.I.P

The third game in the Assassin's Creed Series, the one to introduce new game play mechanics such as the Brotherhood, and other modes such as the Multiplayer. Now, as I do with most of my reviews, I preface whether I do or do not enjoy the series for the possible inferences of bias for said game. I am a massive Assassin's Creed fan, and have been since the original Assassin's Creed was released on the PS3 back in 2007. Now with that out of the way, onto the review.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood has been my favorite Assassin's Creed game ever since it was released in 2010, followed shortly by Revelations and Origins. Although I enjoy most of the games equally, with a few black sheep in the mix, there is something about the Ezio trilogy following Assassin's Creed II that has a special place in my heart. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood resumes it's story immediately after the climax of its predecessor. This was the case for the transition of AC1 to ACII, and I praised that decision in my reviews, of those games, as I will do it here. I love the fact that the story starts off back in the Animus, right where the story had ended prior, which is why I recommend to play these games sequentially.

Now onto the synopsis of the story. The story of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood has a lot of similarities to Assassin's Creed II. Once Ezio returns home to Monteriggioni after completing his mission, and after decades of having to wear the blades, and dawn the armor, he enjoys the peace and quiet of the countryside. Unfortunately it is short lived, as an attack befalls the town and a tragedy occurs to Ezio, which throws him right back into the middle of the fight between the Assassin's and the Templars. Although the situations are different, there are similarities between the tragedy Ezio had suffered years previous, to the one at the beginning of this story. 

I do my best not to reveal any details of the story in my reviews, in the hope that the reader will take the time to play it themselves, so now I will go onto the game play mechanics surrounding the parkour, the player, and the brotherhood.

The parkour in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is nearly identical to that of Assassin's Creed II, in fact the only addition to traversal was the ability to jump on and off of horseback which can aid in the fluidity if you learn the controls. Speaking of fluidity, let's talk about the combat system. ACB had completely revamped the combat from ACII which I can say is a very welcome addition. In AC1, and ACII the combat system was very rudimentary, taking on one enemy at a time, waiting for the right time to parry, counter or evade to get the upper hand on an enemy. However in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, it takes that fighting style to the next level. Once the player successfully parries an enemy, he can use the momentum of that attack to render an entire group of enemies dead in seconds, starting a kill-streak. This makes combat much more fluid, and less time consuming and helps the player feel like a master Assassin. 

Ezio also gets revitalized in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, not only by his motivations, but also by his tools. ACB introduces tools such as the Poison Dart, the Crossbow, and the Parachute just to name a few, and their all useful in their own ways and at certain times that I consider it a necessity to acquire each and every one of these into your arsenal as soon as you can. Additionally, Ezio isn't alone in this fight. After the tragic attack against Monteriggioni, Ezio, alongside some of his fellow Assassin's, go out to recruit members of the population who will not fall under the tyrannical rule of the Pope. This adds a new aspect to being an Assassin, one that I feel no other AC game other than Revelations has quite undertake correctly. As you recruit more and more assassin's, and improve their gear and equipment by sending them on missions, you as a player can have up to twelve Master Assassin's at your disposal. That is if you take the time to recruit and train them.

Finally, one of the last parts of my review is going to be on the multiplayer. I remember back in 2010, purchasing and Xbox Live subscription just so I could play AC Brotherhood's multiplayer alongside some of my closest friends. Unfortunately the servers aren't as populated as they once were, so I won't go into detail about the multiplayer seeing as I feel the Single Player now shines as the crown jewel of this game, not that it wasn't when it was first released, but multiplayer was a nice addition. Really enjoyable as well, and it only got better as time went on and more AC games were released.

Honestly, the more I think about it, the more I realize that my review does not do this game it's justice. The game is beautifully captivating, intensely story driven and motivational, and I didn't have the time to discuss the modern day story line. Although, if I had, I wouldn't have discussed much about that aspect because anything I could say, would spoil parts of the story. Anyways, I would recommend this game in a heartbeat. It's fun, unsurprisingly, and a blast to spend your free time playing, especially if you're looking forward to some of the newer games in the series. I think it only fitting to spend the time playing their predecessors to understand the lore. Know there has been plenty that I have missed about this game, which means if you'd like to learn more about that yourself, just go play it.

That's all I can say.

Anyways stay safe out there y'all, and God Bless.",1593627980,1593627980,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The worst thing were the performance issues. There were a lot of FPS drops and cutscene were even worst in that terms of FPS. The game also crashed quite often. I could never really find out why but I think that the steam overlay might be responsible. 
Another thing that was really annoying were the optional objectives. They really restricted the way you play as long as you wanted to get 100% sync. Some of them were also quite hard to get. The best example for that were probably the optional objectives in the races, I mean you had almost no room for failure. The ""do not be detected"" optional objectives also were annoying to get but not as bad as the ones in races.
The game also really restricts you access to armor at the beginning, and the best armor in the game is also pretty ugly.
I also felt like the notoriety system was introduced and activated a bit to late.

But the game has a lot of good things too.
The story was pretty good especially the modern day stuff. I loved how they developed the relationship among the members of the team and especially the development of Desmonds and Lucys relationship. Then there was the continuation of Ezios story which was amazing. The beginning was really nice, seeing Villa Auditore again and doing a few small missions. Ezios robe was really cool and a nice upgrade from his older robe. The story had nice development and I liked how they used a lot of the characters from AC2 like La Volpe. The villain Cesare was someone you just loved to hate and his death was really satisfying.
The game also allowed you to use the Apple of Eden as a weapon which was really cool. Overall the story was really good but not as good as the story in Assassin's Creed 2. The whole development of the relationships made the ending really shocking and I hope they explain it in one of the next games. There were also the Copernico memories, Cristina memories, the Templar Agent stuff, Thieve and courtesan assignments and the restored memories/ The Da Vinci disappearance. Copernicos missions were fine but nothing special. The Cristina memories on the other hand were really good, they hit really deep and their end was really sad. The Templar Agent missions were entertaining but like the Copernico memories nothing special. The thieve and courtesan were a nice addition to kinda deepen your connection to these factions. Really Amazing was the Da Vinci disappearance. This DLC added the Ezio - Leonardo stuff that the main story was lacking. Especially the last section of the DLC were you discovered the temple was really nice and it was an amazing set piece. You also had a nice callback to AC2 with some of the Lairs of Romulus which I thought was nice.
The game also had a really nice environment but it was a bit annoying to traverse due to the hills.
It was also really nice that they added good controller support that worked well without any other programs.
Leonardos war machines were also pretty cool, except for the boat which I thought was kinda weird to control. 
The way you fast travel in this game was also a nice idea in my opinion, I really liked that you had to renovate the tunnels. Renovating Rome was overall pretty nice but not as cool as renovating Villa Auditore in AC2.
The best addition though was the recruitment system. I loved managing them, sending them on missions and leveling them up. It was also nice to see them become real Assassins once you leveled them enough.
Subject 16s ""rifts"" were nice and I though the second truth was pretty interesting.
The Soundtrack was also really, really good.

Overall I would say that this game is definitely worth it. This game had amazing modern day, a good story and was a nice continuation of Ezios story. The game also looked pretty good and the gameplay is nice, especially the parkour since it is still the same as AC1 and AC2.",1593371581,1593379835,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In this part, Ezio gets to explore Venice and do his missions there. he meets some new characters and the smooth flow of the story and the already quite familiar controls help the player to get through the game, especially if having played the previous parts of Assassin's Creed.
Bugs are nearly non-existent and on a modern gaming-rig the game runs nicely and quite stable.
Ubisoft has definitely put some effort into making this game a worthy continuation of the series.
What can I say.. even if you are not yet hooked to Assassin's Creed through playing the other parts before this one, it is a nice entry point to the series and the developers have put very nice emphasis on also novice players by teaching them the controls very thoroughly.

This game picks up exactly where you left off after AC 2.

I'll be dividing my review into different subjects.
Combat:
The combat in this game feels silky smooth, your sword leaves a white trail as you swing it and feels very responsive when it hits an enemy. The ability to break defenses and counter kill are greatly improved in this game, though I don't like the insta kill streak they implemented. If you kill an enemy you can one hit every single enemy around you right after. They've made enemies much weaker than they already were. In AC 2 i felt like the game was easy enough with brutes and enemies wielding spears the only thing slightly difficult. In this game, not so much. Brutes are way too weak and die quickly and the lads with the spears have the same problem. The combat feels nice, but it's too easy.
6/10 - combat. The combat feels good but the weak enemies effect the experience

Story/Side missions:
The story in this is great, it follows us up on the life of Ezio and he still has about the same personality. Though you'll start to notice that Ezio is under going changes, he's becoming a stronger leader and less repellent. This story is very well written and Ezio has a lot of character to him. 
10/10 - Story. 

Side content:
This game offers a lot of content besides the main story. Such as having to destroy some war machines using new war machines. Recruiting new assassins and sending them on contract to level em up. Assassination contracts, investing in shops, renovating shops and landmarks to increase your income. This game offers lots of good side content.
9/10 - Side content

Arsenal:
Like in AC 2 you get the hidden blade, sword, dagger, hidden gun, bare fists and the ability to inject poison with your hidden blade. On top of these a crossbow was added, it functions exactly like the hidden gun with the only difference you being able to get more shots. Both weapons can be used in stealth without being detected, so it doesn't offer any stealth benefits. The crossbow fits well though I feel like it should offer more range. Depending on what you consider apart of the arsenal there are also the assassin recruits which you can call it to support you or to kill all enemies in an area with arrows.
10/10 - Arsenal: This is perfect, you can't really offer much more, not for a game based in this era.

This is a fantastic game and a great sequel. If you've played AC 2 then you should definitely try this. Though if you care about story then you should really play AC 2 before trying this.

Over all rating: 11/10 - good game",1593159073,1593159073,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The hidden blades and your fists are really all you need to absolutely destroy everybody in your path. However, buying the heavy sheath and just lobbing an axe dispassionately at the face of anyone who notices you exist on rooftops is COMEDY GOLD; this super secret man operating at the highest level of discretion just throws axes at people doing their jobs.

Campaign is fine, ending seems a lil rushed though; the Apple of Eden, despite being an ancient, mystical, and powerful sphere, it just sucks... Seriously. Using it is about as fun as finding out you're allergic to cake, money and friends... You can dye your clothes, and if you so choose, can be absolutely rolling in cash within the first third of the game... Which doesn't have much of a purpose aside from buying different weapons to throw at people. The crossbow is basically like enabling the ""I want to cheat"" option. Despite being a Ubisoft game, this game doesn't crash or absolutely freak out, which is shocking. The Leonardo missions & Romulus lair things are fine, the occasional boring moment here and there but it just makes the axe throwing sections all the sweeter... On saying that, anytime Desmond is on screen i want to rip my ears off and roll on the floor crying and throwing up until he goes away. Definitely worth a play. 10/10.",1593154820,1593154820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The #1 annoyance in jumping/navigation puzzles is when the game suddenly and unexpectedly takes control of the camera, which changes the direction of movement (IE: pressing forward is now moving Ezio sideways, causing me to miss a jump).  This might be OK for console gamers, but for mouse & keyboard PC gamers, the mouse (camera) is a big part of controlling direction.

The other annoyance was a few missions where it wasn't clear what to do next.  There's one that is particularly bad (escorting some soldiers).  The game does not tell the player that being detected causes failure.  In fact, for a brief part of the mission, detection is permitted.  When the player fails due to detection they are not told why they failed, just ""Desynchronized"".  I actually had to break out of the game and go search the web to find out why I was repeatedly failing the mission.

Still, I had more fun than frustration so I'd give this a 7/10 where the original AC2 would get 9/10.  Good, and worth playing if you want to work through the whole AC series.",1592145189,1592145189,True,2,0,0.518248140811920166,0,True,False,False

Pretty much everything has been improved from graphics to gameplay to story too. Fighting and moving is also more fluid, even the horse riding is better. The map is smaller as it's only one city but that's not that big of a problem.

The story starts right after where the previous finished so if you care about it you should play that before (and ACI too obviously). Hard to say anything w/o spoilers, just one thing: the ending was a bit rushed... or that might not be the best word. Rather everything picks up so quickly you just finish the game from almost w/o a caution. Slow build up then a quick ending.

Also it has some gameplay elements that are kinda useless. Especially the whole assassin crew because the game is just easy enough you can do everything alone.

The story isn't anywhere near as good as the second one, but still good in my opinion. The gameplay is sometimes a bit buggy. I had multiple situations, where I had to reset to a checkpoint because I was stuck and soft locked.

Would definitely recommend this game. 

It has some negatives compared to AC2, the combat got way easier due to kill streaks and the forced camera angles during some free running segments make it a nightmare. They also introduced ""Full Sync"" on missions which really does take away from it because you are forced to kill in certain ways etc.  Also beware that you need Vsync on for 2 missions, you will have to go to the main menu and turn it on and then continue the checkpoint, not too much of a hassle. You will know when you hit these points because you wont be able to complete it (well, I did on the first one with literally a second to spare 0.0)

To end on the positive side of things, I love the atmosphere and the villain, I love the ways you can spend your money now. And ofc, I love that it continues the ""other side"" of the story. It's more of the same great gameplay and story. BUY BUY BUY

The story picks up where it ended in AC2 and it takes place in Rome this time. The main story line is way shorter but there is so much you can do outside of the story that the whole game feels way longer.
Lets take a look at pros and cons, shall we ?

Pros (+)
+ The main story line is still solid, especially towards the end where a lot of cool stuff happens.
+ Guild system where you can do missions and challenges for Mercenary Guild, Thief Guild and Courtesans Guild. If you manage to do all of their challenges, you will obtain some of the very best gear in the game.
+ You can make your own Assassin's guild where you recruit citizens to your guild, train them by sending them on missions and you can summon them in battle which is the most effective way to tackle many missions while remaining in the shadows.
+ Secret locations are pretty good and diverse.
+ Economy system where you can rebuild Rome and earn income from landmarks or shops you rebuild. The money can be then used to hire NPC's, buy new gear or consumnables or maps of all kinds of collectibles. There is also option to invest in any shop and if you are lucky, you can earn quite a bit of profit.
+ First AC game that has an achievement system with quite a lot of them to collect.
+ Database with information on all important landmarks and NPC's.
+ Good selection of weapons, armor sets and outfits to choose from. Many of them are earned for completing different objectives.
+ Couple of missions that feature different war machines like tank, cannon, machine gun (primitive version) and bomber.
+ Improved graphics compared to AC2 and better performance (much less random stuttering and FPS drops).
+ Great soundtrack as always. Voice acting is also superb.
+ Extremely stable and well optimized. Not a single crash or freeze in almost 60 hours.

Cons (-)
- This one is seriously annoying and it was one of the two things that really made me hate the game sometimes: most of the missions has optional requirements which you have to fullfill to obtain 100% synchronization required for 100% completion. This is by far the most frustrating thing this game could do because it strictly limits your options how you want to complete the mission. Most of the time, you either have to kill your enemy in certain way or with specified weapon and any other kill will make you fail. Many missions are also timed if you are aiming for 100% sync which I personally hate since I enjoy playing at my pace and not to rush.
There is also great amount of missions where you can't be detected or take any damage as requirement for 100% sync which can be extremely frustrating at times and you can spend even hours trying to do some of the missions, for example Hell on Wheels mission with tank, where you can't take any damage while inside the tank (doesn't make sense) or you will fail and the whole mission is like 20-30 minutes long so if you fail, good luck again.

- The second issue I had with the game was camera (same problems I had with previous 2 AC games) where the camera will just randomly change or it will position in a way where you absolutely have no idea in what direction to jump and you can keep failing a lot because of this, especially in those timed missions. It might not be such an issue with controller but on keyboard, it is very frustrating. Fortunately, it's only in couple of missions and not during regular gameplay.

Conclusion
Very solid game that offers a lot of different content to choose from. A lot was improved since AC2 and some tedious tasks were removed to make the game less repetitive and more interesting to play. I have not felt bored at any point in the game and even after 100% completion, I was kinda sad that it was already over. I found the game enjoyable, except few very frustrating missions.

I would recommend it to AC fans. If you enjoyed AC2 then this one is no-brainer and you should play it as well.",1590916139,1590916139,True,0,0,0.497560977935791016,0,True,False,False

The level design really was fantastic, seeing all the old roman ruins and foundations of modern day Rome. Although I wish I could have galloped with my horse rather than canter through the city as it would have made travelling to unique locations and between missions easier. 

There was a good addition of new features such as parachutes, recruiting assassins and unique weapons and armour which added to the fun of collecting items for the hideout. However! Not all the collecting was exciting, I was shy of 100% because some of the collectable flags were in the secret locations which I thought was silly as some of them had chase scenes which prevented you from exploring. Additionally, collecting treasures was a pain as it always has been, but you do it anyway!

The story was pretty interesting and introduced some enigmatic characters as well as showcasing previously seen characters. A lot of the quests were quite entertaining, some with ridiculous 100% sync requirements and some which were annoying fetch quests, but overall it was a good experience!

I definitely recommend buying Brotherhood on sale, as while it is good, it's an older game now and didn't expand too much on Ezio's trilogy like Revelations did. Combat was the same easy counter/kill sort of thing, setting was similar although stunning, dialogue was basic at times, but quests were entertaining and the overall story was alright!",1590394099,1590394099,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, this game feels like DLC for Assassin's Creed 2. If you played these at release, that might be a good thing. Since I played them back to back, I hardly did any side quests this time because they were all the same as before, with the exception of Leonardo machines and assassin recruitment, those were fine. Other than that, it really feels like more of the same game. If you loved AC2, that's a good thing. For me, it got dry really quick.

Ezio’s story continues nicely here, although the ending kind of abruptly moves you to it, but I was ready to finish it so it was whatever.

After playing AC2 and this one, I’m baffled as to why they even keep putting other weapons into this game besides the hidden blade since it is so overpowered. You can literally one hit any non boss enemy with it, so for both the last game and this one I used it 99% of the time, and hardly ever touched the other weapons.

Additionally, there were two parts that I hit in the last hour of the game that would NOT work unless you lowered your monitor refresh rate to 60 hz and turned v sync on, otherwise cutscenes would not initiate. While the key commands were fixed in this one compared to that horrendous job in the last one, I don’t understand how the refresh rate affected the game in such a way. Thank goodness for Steam forums, they saved me on that one. I was almost out of luck after 15 hours of gameplay.

This one is shorter than AC2, and there did seem to be overall less to do, but I was just playing for the story. Usually I try to unlock armor or buy all the weapons in a game, but I knew what really worked from the last game and didn't bother wasting my time with the other items. Seriously, just use the hidden blade for everything, and maybe the pistol.

Do I recommend this game? I guess it just depends on how much you like AC2 and want more AC2.

This story picks up right where AC II left off and there is no drop in the intensity and the action.

I started binging the Assassin's Creed series for the first time recently, after I finished Assassin's Creed I, I put it in such high regard and thought that the game sealed the formula for the franchise, yes, there might be many entries to come, but all of them will be just the same game, just with different characters. Assassin's Creed II blew me and that bigoted opinion out of the water. The game set very high expectations for the following games to surpass, and thus I fell into the trap, yes, this is it, this is as good as these games will get. I heard about Brotherhood at this point, but only reading the name in my head wasn't hype for it enough to get me in the spirit of checking it out, I guess it was just another lame entry I'll have to force myself through to get to the “better” one later.

I was wrong.
At this point, the only opinion I have on the series is that every game surpasses the last, at least, I hope it's the case for the other games to comen but this one, oh boy, how should I put it. If GTA III was the start of a franchise they same Assassin's Creed I was, then GTA Vice City was the one who popularized the series and the one that gets the fan discussing it to this day, the same as Assassin's Creed II, the first game hasn't received that well I read, but the second game is still being praised very high to this day, and don't get me wrong, both games are work of art (GTA VC and AC II), What next? I guess we can agree that Vice City has a massive mark on what the GTA games are like today, however, it was thanks to GTA San Andreas where the series really reached a hights in the open-world formula, and Brotherhood is to Assassin's Creed what San Andreas was to GTA.

I would say that Assassin's Creed II had the better story, but Brotherhood got the gameplay right. The graphics got a bump up, cold colors and more contrast. I like the shadows of the clouds that run across the city of Rome, the massive exposure in the draw distance, just everything I complained about in Assassin's Creed was addressed.
I was and still am for the longest time conflicted on which game had the best location, I really liked the massive open streets of the second game, but Brotherhood's narrow passages and frequence ruins had a special appeal. The map is now a single location completely opened for you to free-roam without having to pass through any loading screens, but I was sad that Monteriggioni was left out aside from the opening scene, I really liked the idea of having a home base that you can upgrade at your own pace and make money from, but I realized with time that the entirety of Rome was the newt Monteriggioni, a complete city waiting for renovations and upgrades. This game really wanted to up everything.

I noticed that this was the first game that had the first dose of cinematic life action (quick-action) sequences which picked up the slow pace of the game but also left a tone of freedom for your to-do your assassinations your way. I though the full-sync / half-sync mission completion was a genius way to encourage the replayability of every mission and side quests.

Another thing I really appreciate, something hat instantly put this game over the last is how easy and bearable collecting the collectibles are, I used to used third-party resources, static and blurry maps from the internet to pinpoint the stuff I needed to collect to get to the 100% completion but this game knows the struggles and has those maps build in, you just need to get to a certain point of the story and have enough money and knowledge of the locations. I, for the first time, had fun running across the map and looking for collectibles.

The coolest feature has to be the brotherhood management. It is never not cool to stumble across random people in need of help and recruit them into the brotherhood, send them to different missions and watch your pupils grown into assassin's, the arrow storm is also a very handy and powerful tool.

And just when none of that is enough, CHEATS. This masterpiece has a cheats menu. It's so fun to play as Desmond in Rome, wielding a lightning sword and deploying infinite assassins left and right. And of course, Raiden from Metal Gear Solid. I am satisfied.

Well, yeah, there were some problems with the game, frequent bugs (More than the previous two games), FPS drops, the gale just doesn't play well on more than 60 FPS, not only that, but some missions won't function properly if not played at 60 FPS or lower which made the immersion drop as hard as the FPS.

Yep, I'm saying it, Brotherhood is the best game in the series, and as hard as it might be, I'm going to go on to the next one fully open-minded, although surpassing this one will be quite an achievement.",1589282642,1589282642,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

However

If you're going to play ANY Assassin's Creed game, do it on a console. I was very disappointed to discover the terrible bugginess of this game on PC, with Ezio's falling animations becoming rather jumpy and all over the place, the occasional T-pose and clipping through the world, causing Ezio to fly into the air and killing him on impact, as well as this one time where the game may well have given an epileptic a seizure as it seemed to blink in and out of existence, with Ezio completely disappearing.

Worst of all, though, is the fact that this game seems to be quite literally unplayable at parts. During a side-mission in which you are tasked with flying over some factories to destroy them, I discovered that the movement controls stopped working. It had nothing to do with the gamepad cutting out or the game just completely cutting out controls, as I could still fire the cannon, pause the game and navigate the menu, but upon resuming the game: no movement control. Doing some googling I found a handful of threads complaining of the same issue, with a fix that required turning V-Sync on and lowering refresh rate to 60Hz. This still left the game impossible for me, however, as I cannot lower my refresh rate below 120Hz. The same google search also led me to find reports that the final mission of the game suffers the same problem.

I was extremely disappointed to find that Ubisoft is too lazy to adequately port their games onto PC, despite going through the effort to have every single one available on Steam.

tl;dr: The PC versions of AC games are extremely buggy. Play on console instead.",1589156339,1589156681,False,1,1,0.508771896362304688,21,True,False,False

The story is not very long but interesting and engaging if you are the type of person who really gets in to games. Now as I'm writing this review in may of 2020 if you buy the game now you can get it for not mutch at all.

I bought this game for the views of ancient Rome, since I watched too many Roman documentaries and eager to quench my thirst. It's the period of Rome, however, occupied by Borgia. So, none roman armour fetish involved.

Parkour is not particular my thing, which made the entire play through focused too much on WALKING and being punished by WALKING is frustrating. All the scenes I expected to see in Rome was lost in motion blur(or your eyes cant just capture them fast enough while running constantly).

I played the AC1, it was so new, it was like western Tenchu ninja game. But it lost me at the metal apple part. I like conspiracy theories, but the plots in this game series just feel a bit loose. 

So, being punish for bad WALKING in a ARPG game is rather not interesting (I mean the secret location parts). All the views were lost when you have to hide and run nonstop. While story, the conspiracies are just not engaging and attractive enough (when you present a conspiracy related story, there have to be some slow-paced detective plots involved, right?).

Overall you should play it to finish the AC2 story, but this game is way more boring than i remember it. The opening villa fight is cool and Rome is interesting as a setting, but the story sort of goes nowhere for a long time. You are after Cesare, but you also have to rebuild the brotherhood, which includes a bunch of missions convincing the same assassins you just helped in AC2. There seems to be a million tail missions and the world time progresses from one month/year to another but missions feel like they are minutes or days apart. Especially noticeable at the end when you chase Cesare though Rome, and its apparently been like 5 months since you got the apple and chased him from the Collesium to the city gates. 

Rome feels pretty empty too, even though you have you nameless and faceless assassins id have liked more main story interaction with Davinci, your family and the other Assassins. There is more modern day stuff here  with some odd missions here and there. Its kinda cool as the location is the villa from AC2 instead of a boring old warehouse like AC2.

You can play AC2 without then going onto play Brotherhood, and vice verse, its a direct continuation. Play it for that reason.",1588130579,1588130579,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The story continues right after the ending of the second game so playing AC 2 and then going to AC Brotherhood felt like rush. What i love is how the custcenes in this game is impressive,  its very improved from the previous one, and im also glad they removed the qte cause sometimes in AC 2 i would not have the time to press the prompt button because how fast the prompt disappear. Another thing that i like is the camera in this game, its not too far and not too close, my issue with the camera in AC 2 is that its a bit far and made the character felt a bit too floaty. i like how the movement felt in this one more than AC 2. The characters are great again just like the previous game, Ezio definitely has matured but still the one you remembered from AC 2. The city of Rome is very very beautiful.

Now for the parts that i didn't like. while this is a great game, i do have some issues with it. horses are back in this game, the problem is that you can't gallop in this one which is very strange. you can only gallop at certain missions. Another problem is that i really didn't really like the area around the big city, it felt at times to empty. I didn't really like the bonus suit for collecting the Romulus keys, i mean compared to AC 2 Altair armor, the suit in this one felt a bit to much with the design.

The game ran at 144+ FPS which is a huge step-up from ACII. The problems I ran into were massive instances of stuttering and bugs. For some reason running over 60 FPS broke some cinematics and the bomber. There were also massive performance fluctuations for whatever reason.
Gameplay was a step-up from ACII. Definitely a lot more to do on the map. Combat was great with the addition of the crossbow and execution streaks. The streaks made combat a little too easy however. Renovating was okay since it was just extra things to waste money on.

There isn't really a point to a pros/cons list since this is more or less the same game as AC2 but with a worse map and a worse storyline.
The antagonists didn't really appeal to me and neither did the new map. While the setting is basically the same as AC2, the map doesn't feel as interesting to explore as that of AC2 did. The storyline didn't grab me at all even though it got a bit outrageous at times.

I played through the game in two sittings which lead to me trying to 100% it in the first one, only to rush the last sequence in the second time. While it tried getting everything out of this game in the beginning, it couldn't hold on to my attention for long enough so sadly, unlike with AC1/2, there is some content that I have yet to complete but probably won't.

Even though this game is clearly not as much of a jump as AC2 was to AC1, I can still recommend it to any fan of the series. It's regularly on sale and you can get a good 20h of fun out of it. If you're looking to get into the series though, I would recommend AC2 over this, as this is little more than a large expansion in my opinion.",1586887719,1587030331,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The biggest issue for me is that, by the third major installment in the series, you'd think they'd have all of the jank sorted out. Wrong.

Handful of things I disliked / was neutral on:
[list]
    [*]Freerunning can still be such a PAIN. Like oh my god, for the amount of freerunning you have to do in these games, why does Ezio still want to jump in random directions, even though I'm clearly pointing the camera and directional stick in the proper direction I'd like to jump??! Also climbing straight up can be so slow and terrible sometimes. Ezio's whole jump-and-grab-a-higher-ledge move doesn't work 90% of the time.
    [*]Combat is still shallow and annoying. The whole killstreak thing is fun and looks cool, and so is calling in support, but I still dread going into combat because every encounter is the exact same.
    [*]Underdeveloped mechanics. The whole Brotherhood thing is half-baked. Like I said, using the Brotherhood Assist move is fun, but I just don't get the whole mission system of sending them out on tasks. To level up any single one of the members just seems like such an insane waste of time and effort. I don't want to micromanage in a game like this lol.
    [*]Synchronization. I get that there is a percentage for total completion, that's fine. But I just hate how to unlock the Cristina memories, you HAVE to complete a whole bunch of other malarkey. I also disliked that if you fail 'full synchronization' during a mission, you hear a big ugly horn and it tells you you failed. Save that for the end, or show me if I go to the menu. I don't want to be constantly reminded that I'm a failure. 
    [*]The UI / Animus stuff. Why does there need to be a seizure inducing animation every time I access the menu?? Why do you have to put up this big ugly 'Animus data cloud' or whatever the fuck it is when I go to a zone that I'm ""not supposed to access""? Why are you showing me a screenshot of the mission I'm about to do and spoiling it for me???
    [*]The graphics are fine, especially for a 2010 game, but man all of the NPC's are ugly as heck. And all the colours are that dark brown / grey pallette that every video game company was obssessed with after the Modern Warfare series came out. 
    [*]Why are there gaurds everywhere? Why do they keep attacking me even though I freed a district? These games are all about freerunning right? WHY AM I BEING PUNISHED WHEN I RUN ON A ROOF? WHY ARE THIEVES RANDOMLY ATTACKING ME????
    [*]I hated how almost all of the Codex entires had some dumbass sarcasm in them. I'm genuinely curious in learning a little bit of the history of Rome. I don't need Rebecca (or whoever wrote the entries in the game) to fill it with stupid quips.

Also, I'm actually trying really hard to enjoy the modern day stuff, because they shove it down your throat, but it's SO BAD. I can't deal with Shaun's quips. He's such a terrible character. Some of the stuff they deal with is actually really neat, but every single character is just so pathetic, it makes me want to pull my hair out. 

What does the game do right then?
[list]
    [*]Like every [i]Assassin's Creed[/i] they nail the atmosphere. There's no other games that allow you to explore the Crusades, or Victorian London, or in this case, the Renaissance. 
    [*]The Roma cast is great, and one thing I liked in particular is that there were a lot less characters and locations than in the second game; it allows the player to focus more on important characters and events. 
    [*]The side quests were more concentrated in this game, and felt improved. (Like the Romulus Lair puzzles, Courtesan assignments etc.) 
    [*]The story isn't quite as ""gripping"" as the overall story in [i]Assassin's Creed II[/i], but the issue with the second game's story is that it dragged on forever. In [i]Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood[/i], the story is a lot more dialed down, not really filled with padding, and focused, which I appreciated a lot. 
[/list]

While I couldn't get into a multiplayer match, I have played the multiplayer modes of the following games. They aren't amazing. Too many unlockables and perks and general jank, but there are some interesting ideas for sure so it's not a total waste. 

My final score is 6.8/10.0. [i]Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood[/i] is so close to being a good game. There ARE improvements from the first two games, but many of the most annoying flaws in those games are still present here, and drown out the issues that could be easily fixed. Like most of the [i]Assassin's Creed[/i] games, get it on a sale. This game is old as heck, and not worth paying $20, or $30 for Deluxe.

Welp, next up is [i]Revelations[/i]...",1534116103,1586232990,False,0,0,0.431654691696166992,0,True,False,False

However, this is the first of the games where synchronization and arbitrary goals become a thing. Now for the record, I've 100% completed the DNA sequence (several times by now, probably), and it became a grind and a pain towards the end. There are quite a few missions that have no purpose other than introducing some arbitrary multiplayer character.

I want to make a brief mention of this. [b]Multiplayer mode for this game has affected the quality of the story and the overall quality of the single player experience for the worse.[/b] I want to get that out of my system since I feel most of what is wrong with this game can be traced back to the split interests of this game. I would make mention of what the multiplayer is like, but unfortunately, the servers have long since gone offline so it's impossible.

What is there to then say about this game? One of the main things is that again, the voice acting is spot on, the story is adequate. Although it feels like something that is inconsequential, it does add to Ezio's story quite nicely in a way that doesn't horrible detract from the earlier game. The Rome mini-game is dope and it's something I've undoubtedly sunk a lot of hours into. There are [b]plenty[/b] of side missions to enjoy. The assassin mini-game and having the brotherhood assistance is very fun (if a little broken).

Most importantly, [spoiler]Christina's death at the end of the repressed memories arch[/spoiler] literally reduced me to tears. On stream. It was amazing.

I also didn't find Brotherhood's story as varied or engaging as Assassin's Creed II's. That said, Ezio is still a lovable character and it's a joy to spend time in his shoes.

It's worth noting that Brotherhood actually handles worse than ACII, with menu navigation mapped to less convenient keys and a broken targeting system that turned combat into a bit of a chore. I also encountered a glitch at the end of a relatively involved mission and had to abort it, wiping out over an hour of progress. I was not happy. 

Still, there's a lot to love about this game, and I think my opinion of it would have been higher if I hadn't dived into it directly after the amazing ACII. Recruiting assassins and making them do my dirty work was really fun, and torching Borgia towers never got old.

First off the cannon controls are wonky, it’s like the sensitivity was driven down to the ground and you don’t want to go in and mess with the settings to the point of making your actual character uncontrollable. I had a lot of issues with gameplay, I would try to do something or even try NOT to do something and it would just do its own thing, I know that’s a common thing people make up excuses for but I felt like some of the jumps in this game were cheated. The combat is pretty weird because you just keep kicking and slashing, you can grab which is cool but I’m just not a big fan of the system as a whole, I expected a more stealth like approach to this game. NOPE. There actually isn’t even an option at most points, you just have to run it and gun it as best you can, that’s not to say this game is too hard though.

I actually like this game for some reason, it’s a relatively open world (with reasonable limits most of the time) with optional side quests, different gear, different colors you can dye your outfit. There are waypoints you can buy and that way next time you can just go inside one waypoint to get to another but honestly I just ran around the map by foot or by horse and was fine with it, the world was flourishing enough and simple enough to traverse. I have to say I expected something different but I can’t say what I got was “bad”, I mean I’ve heard all kinds of bad things about AC so I just chalked them up towards that and there are a lot of things wrong as I mentioned but it still kept me going. By the time I finished it, there are very little things this game did that others games didn’t do better including Uncharted and Tomb Raider but the story and feeling (Dat Italiano) made it worth the effort.",1582648115,1582648115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

48190,43594565,76561198291338568,163,38,3376,0,2690,1531358479,"Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is, in my opinion, the best game in the series, after the first one, and it’s one of my favorite games of all-time. The game has been out for nearly a decade, but Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is still a must-play, and is worth picking up digitally or if you happen to stumble upon a copy.

I have a love/hate relationship with the Assassin’s Creed games. I love the historic settings. I love the feeling of becoming a badass Assassin. I love the combat. I love the parkour. I love the basic mechanics of the game. The earlier games had an amazing and rich story to be told and I still find enjoyment in going back and playing the first few.

I hate that it became a repetitive yearly saga that lost what made it so amazing about it in the first place. They’ve used the same cookie cutter formula in multiple games year after year that has become boring and tedious to play through. The main character goes through something dramatic, something bad happens, then he goes out for revenge as an Assassin because the person who made the bad thing happen was a Templar all along.

Recent Assassin’s Creed games go up and down in quality. Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag  rejuvenated the series,Unity was a very noticeable step-down, and Syndicate proved that the series might not be on its last legs just yet. It was a relief when Ubisoft announced that they would be taking this year off. It gives the series a chance to rest, catch its breath, and evaluate what made the series great in the first place, much if which is in place in Assassin’s Creed II, but refined to perfection in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood.

Brotherhood is set directly after the events of AC:II. Ezio returns to Monteriggioni with one of the Apples of Eden, comforted by the fact that his personal vendetta is over. Monteriggioni is then attacked by the Borgias, and Ezio’s uncle, Mario, is killed by Cesare Borgia. Realizing that there is a bigger threat at hand, and due to the fact that the Borgias now possess the Apple, Ezio heads to Rome to rebuild the Assassins Guild there.

While in many ways Brotherhood does follow the same cookie cutter plot outlined above, it just does all of these things exponentially better than most other Assassin’s Creed games. The story features amazing, poignant moments, such as the mission in which you must prevent an assassination attempt in the ruins of the Roman Colosseum during a play about the death of Jesus Christ. This entire mission is intense and memorable. The atmosphere is hard to explain, and must be experienced and played to truly be appreciated.

The gameplay in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is exceptional. It introduced a new mechanic to the already fantastic combat from AC:II, chain attacks. This new feature makes the combat flow exceptionally well, and you will feel like the highly-trained assassin Ezio is supposed to be as you mow down baddies one after another. A shining example of how well this works is in an early story mission where you are set to meet Niccolò Machiavelli in some of the ruins that are scattered around Rome. When you arrive, Machiavelli is not there and you are attacked by numerous members of The Followers of Romulus, a sect of powerful warriors employed by the Borgias to take out the Assassins. It is the most satisfying feeling to kill one, move on to the next, then the next, until you have completely eliminated your would-be killers.

Perhaps the greatest contribution Brotherhood made to the Assassin’s Creed franchise was the introduction of Apprentices. This fantastic new mechanic was innovative, fun to use and, and provided a much-needed metagame and long-term gameplay loop. These recruits are citizens of Rome who you must rescue from the Borgias. Once you do so, they join you and become apprentice Assassins in training. You can use these apprentices to assassinate targets or incapacitate guards. You can also send them out on missions of their own across Europe to fulfill contracts to gain experience, money, and objects. Eventually, they can be leveled up to become fully fledged Assassins.

As Ubisoft looks to return the Assassin’s Creed franchise to its former glory, they would do well to remember what made Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood so exceptional. The story, the gameplay, and the metagame all came together to make the game unmatched by any other in the series. Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is available now on Steam, and used copies are easy to come by, so if you are a fan of the series or action games in general, you owe it to yourself to play this game.",1531869009,1582188090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]I'm playing the Assassin's Creed games in order and reviewing as I go.  You can start with AC1 here:
https://steamcommunity.com/id/bobbyoahu/recommended/[/i]

At this point in my gameplay, I’ve taken a break.  I went right from [i]Assassin’s Creed 2[/i] (or AC2) to [i]Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood[/i] (or AC Bros).
The Good:  you pick up right where AC2 left off (no spoilers and i know the game is ten years old shut up).
The Bad:  you get another non-tutorial tutorial.  The game gives you all the armor, weapons and skills from AC2 (and even tosses in a crossbow) only to take it all away in the first half-hour.  
The Good:  The game explains Ezio’s loss of skills with a doctor telling him “a man your age takes longer to recover.”  Ezio walks off grumbling about that.  Heh.

Moving on to the main gameplay… well, there’s some mixed feelings here.  Now, I get that’s it’s a sequel and you gotta add features in a sequel.  AC1 was very light on features, so the metric poop-ton of features in AC2 were a welcome addition.  And the new features were fun!  AC2 was so much fun that, even as I focused on finishing the story, I still found myself kicking around on gondolas and climbing viewpoint towers.  

AC Bros captures that magic - for the most part.  For example: a welcome addition are the Borgia Towers.  These are viewpoints that require you to kill an enemy captain, then burn down the viewpoint.
And still welcome:  the little things, like that time I saw a Harlequin capering about and the game lit him up like an enemy.  I got closer and ended up in a fist-fight with a clown!  And it’s a side mission!  I have four more clowns to beat down!  HA!

Then we get to the unwelcome:  the investment system.  Why, Assassin’s Creed?  [i]WHY?[/i]  Who thought it was a good idea to incorporate an accounting simulator into a murder simulator?

See, when you “liberate” – or, “commit murder and arson” – in a neighborhood, you can open up all the shops in the area.  And you can invest in the shops for… random junk that you already get from treasure chests?  I mean, it’s not for more money, the payout is dismal. (I’ve sunk 10,000 florins so far and made back 10,400 florins.  [i]Wow.[/i])  The random junk you pick up in treasure chests doesn’t seem to have a purpose other than selling the random junk for florins.  FFS game!  Just gimme the [i]dannati florini![/i]

[i]Three Hours Later Edit: Okay – collect enough random junk and you can complete shop quests where you trade the junk for armor and weapons!  Why, just the other day I completed a shop quest and got a sword!  That’s not as good as the axe I bought!

Yeah, the investment system is the worst.[/i]


Anyway.  You might see why it was time for a break.

[i]THL Edit:  Three games in, I’m starting to get that Assassin’s Creed games have a difficulty plateau.  There’s a point where the games give you a new weapon or mechanic and just like that, missions go from frustrating grinds to exercises in creative murder.
In AC1 it’s throwing knives.
In AC2 it’s smoke bombs.
In AC Bros it’s your bros.
My recommendation: keep with AC Bros until you get your bros.  I tell you, having a small army of stabby bros really changes the game.[/i]

I mean, I’m doing all this exploring and side-missioning and I just realized I don’t have those hired assassin recruits everyone talks about online.  (No one talks about investing because of course they don't.)  Where are my recruits?  Oh I’m about five jabroni-murders away from getting them!  FFS!

[i]THL Edit: Okay, that was one mission in five parts, but you definitely have to murder five or more jabronis.[/i]

Let’s summarize:
AC1 was like an ounce of game trying to fill a two-gallon jug of playtime.
AC2 was like a swimming pool of game, comfortably filling a swimming pool of playtime.
AC Bros is a like a swimming pool of game with a secret tunnel in the deep end that leads to a cave inhabited by wolf-cultists who attack you with knives and Quickbooks 2010.

★★☆☆☆ AC1 was rough around the edges, both story and gameplay wise, barely tolerable, but this was acceptable, because it birthed multiple new genres (open world parkour, counter based combat, and map-revealing towers) and iconic new concepts (hidden blades, white hoods, and bales of hay).  An engine with ultra realistic climbing and combat animations.

★★★★☆ AC2 fixed every problem with the original, while at the same time making huge new additions to the series.  Ezio, currency, equipment, upgradable village, sidequests and more.  

[b]★★★★★ ACB[/b] fine tuned things even further, and added yet more content and features.  It was impressive, the pinnacle of the series, before AC lost it's writer and then transitioned to a new engine; 1shot1kill meaningful combat, dual hidden blades as a combat weapon, upgrade the entire world now, build a brotherhood, unlock guild perks, unlock gadgets with leo, parachutes, perfect openworld replayability with rewardingly sensible bonus mission objectives, tons of little touches like free jumping or poking out your hidden blades for vanity, and much more.  This game also added unique cat/mouse multiplayer, though I didn't much care for that.  

[i]* AC2 is quite possibly the only sequel in gaming history of legitimate value, aside from maybe the Final Fantasy series, which hardly qualify as sequels.  This wasn't just a L4D2 adding 4 new maps and 4 new survivors,  or an RE4/5 where the entire game was changed, or Dead Risings offering a new mall, or Farcry 3 and 4 being practically identical games, and lets not even get into CoD; it was an improvement and expansion of every idea in the game.  Even Arkham City, which is a ★★★★★ game and grand improvement over Asylum, could have been treated as a simple open world expansion on the original.  Most sequels are more like DLC, and most actual DLC is a total ripoff.  ACB, while an improvement, could have been an expansion for AC2, and the games only go downhill after that.[/i]

★★☆☆☆ ACRevelations removed many features, added nothing meaningful, and had a blatant change in writers.  Not only had the tone and setting changed for the worse, but the previous games were practically ignored, even though ACB ended on multiple cliff hangers. 

★★☆☆☆ AC3 moved to a new engine, while it was graphically superior, the gameplay became floaty and overly simplified, with practically none of the deep features that made AC good, and climbing animations that looked as if they were captured by Twilight's laughable wire team.  The writing was also poor, with a seemingly motivationalless, unlikable, unrelatable, bipolar main character.  The ship combat, however, was amazing here, probably the best ship combat ever put into a video game, sadly only treated as a minigame.

★★★★☆ AC4; PIE RATS.  The story is a bit better here, the engine is a bit better here, the ship combat is a bit worse, but more integrated.  Many mechanics return, and the setting is shiney.  Overall, a solid game.  

★★★☆☆ ACRogue is basically AC3.5.  

★☆☆☆☆ ACU; A fantastic game, lost to an unplayable combat system, and more bugs than Early Access.  Ships have been removed.  Combat has been reduced to stat based button mashing.  However, it did attempt coop, and has decent graphics and customization.  

★★☆☆☆ ACS; A step sideways from Unity, this time with poor performance, parkour has practially been removed, as you can simply zipline around the world.  You can no longer flourish your weapons, jump freely, interact with civilians, or even attack with your hidden blades.  I don't like the setting either, and the story wasn't good enough to keep me interested, even with (or especially because?) it attempts to tell you 5 stories at once.  This isn't even AC anymore.

The mechanics added to this instalment fall into one of two categories: tools that just make the game directly easier, and entire mini-games totally separate from the main game. An updated combat system introduced the ‘spam X to kill’ problem, plus the addition of a high-powered ranged weapon in the crossbow makes any stealth segment trivial.

On top of that we’ve got the game’s namesake - a system where you recruit riotous citizens from the streets to join your ‘brotherhood’. Through the use of a terrible user interface you can send them on various missions around the world to bring back money and level themselves up, or with the tap of a button you can have them assassinate whoever you’re looking at. If you have enough people recruited you can just hold down said button and have them instantly kill an entire crowd of enemies from off-screen. I guess this ties into the overarching problem with the game, which isn’t just that it’s too easy or that virtually all of the side content revolves around investing in shops and delivering tomatoes - the real problem is that on every level the game has introduced more tools and things to do, but not introduced any new challenges or reason to do those things.

I don’t want to say I hate [i]Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood[/i]. It is, in many ways, the same game as [i]Assassin’s Creed 2[/i],  but the interesting characters and story that game offered up to compensate for its many gameplay shortcomings are only present in name here, with a plot that just spins its wheels to avoid doing away with a popular protagonist, and with no reason to really care what happens to anyone or how the thing plays out, it’s kind of hard to recommend this lengthy and arduous retread through things that have already been done more interestingly.",1438769807,1579990011,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The quality of life improvements of Black Flag seem to be a generation ahead of the jittering and sloppy controls of the original games.  Similarly, I'm guessing this is a bad port because the pop-in and frame rate slow downs are some of the worst I've ever seen. 

Likewise, if you ever wanted frustrating instant fail missions that force you to either follow or babysit characters this game will drive you up a wall.  The controls continue to be a problem when the weirdos who designed intricate parkour/climbing puzzles want you to be ultra precise and their scheme lends itself to being mushy and floaty.  

AND YET, it's still a great game.  One of the better stories, plenty of interesting characters, and the thrill of exploring Rome are all there and they're all great.  Building your own Assassin brotherhood and watching them take out your enemies is a feeling second to none.  The game continues to have great style, addictive building mini-games, and it continues to downplay Desmond and that is great in my book.

So I'm starting with Brotherhood as I only really gave 1 and 2 a fair shot. I have to admit, I always felt they could of done without the futuristic story line (as most people do), but Brotherhood pushes it along none the less, picking up where things left of from the end of AC2.

The game-play has been ripped straight from AC2 with a few extra features added in. Nothing ground breaking or interesting for that matter, buying real-estate and recruiting assassins don't add too much fun. But if you wanted more of Ezio, the story from 1500s Rome is serviceable as you get to follow one of the best characters in the series.

Too bad the optimization for PC is garbage. I am of the lucky ones that I can play it consistently almost always at over 100 FPS, but every 15 minutes or so it stutters and drops frames like crazy for a couple of seconds.
The game is aids because in order to access all of the content, you have to complete achievements that come in the form of *full synchronization* in the main missions and side missions. That means that you MUST use specific items, or game mechanics to finish a mission in order to synchronize properly. Example, don't kill faggy mcdouchebag with a sword, but with a knife. Or don't get spotted. Or some other childish tryhard achievement. 

A big F U from the game dev in this regard. Also, you won't be given from the last checkpoint if you fail synchronization. 

If I could, I'd buy this game for max 1 dollar. Game devs need to be taught to not force upon players a way of playing the game, especially if they consider it a SANDBOX.

48190,61844002,76561198048888505,0,5,2978,0,2136,1657801498,"This is the BEST version of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, with some rather fine graphics and gameplay for its time, while the story isn't as amazing as Assassin's Creed 2's incredible story. 

It massively improves upon the graphics of Assassin's Creed 2, while adding more to the story of Ezio Auditore and expands upon Assassin's Creed 2 with memories never seen in Assassin's Creed 2.

Brotherhood introduces new mechanics, such as the killstreak mechanic, where if you kill a guard (during combat) you can immediately kill another guard, which helps speed battles up a lot, it may make battles seem too easy, but the guards have many strategies around this, such as Grabbing Ezio to put a stop to his killing-spree or trying to attack him. The next mechanic they introduce is the Brotherhood of Assassins, where Ezio recruits assassins to join him in his quest to take away the Borgia's control of Rome, they can be used to assist Ezio in assassinating others to help him not get detected, Kill multiple people very quickly, or be sent on missions either within Italy or outside of Italy to help the Assassins gain more experience. They also change Ezio's controls a bit, in combat the A button or spacebar button no longer strafes now it allows you to kick enemies which force guards to lower their guard against your attacks. 


The controls use a similar control scheme to Assassin's Creed 2, so if you've already played assassin's Creed 2 you should be familiar with Brotherhood's controls, except for the Kick button a new addition that moves the strafe to double-tapping in a direction (or pushing the analog stick twice quickly in a direction) to strafe, parkour feels very similar to Assassin's Creed 2, which isn't a bad thing as at the time Assassin's Creed 2's parkour was considered very good, and Ubisoft didn't want to risk breaking something that wasn't broken, the parkour compared to future titles does feel dated but it works for the environment of Rome which works wonderfully. 

But Ezio's Parkour on its own has some limitations as there are some areas that are unreachable without the Climb Leap Glove, an item which you pay Leonardo Di Vinci to make for Ezio, this item allows Ezio to do a Climb Leap, in which Ezio uses his arms to launch himself upwards in order to grab onto a ledge that would normally be out of reach, this move would be done by Pressing space to initiate the Climb leap, then Shift, in order to grab onto whatever Ezio needs to hold onto in order to get higher on a building, with a Controller it would be by Holding RT and pressing A, or Holding R2 and pressing X, this ability can also be used to speed up Ezio's climbing as it can be done anywhere except for on the edge of buildings and grounds, as there's nothing for Ezio to leap towards.

There are also obtainable outfits via the returning Uplay Points system, BUT you don't use money to buy them, these unlockables cost ""Uplay points"", a system where you can only get these ""Uplay points"" by playing through Ubisoft's games like Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, this allows you to unlock Altair's Robes, Noble Florentine outfit, and the Armour of Altair, which changes how Ezio looks but these are purely cosmetic and they're all great in their own way as they change the look, as many may either be fans of Altair, fans of Ezio before he got the Assassin Outfit, or dislike the look of the ultimate armour and want the one from Assassin's Creed 2.

however, there are some downsides you'll never be able to 100% unlock everything in the game due to Assassin's Creed Project Legacy, a Facebook game that you were originally supposed to sync with Brotherhood to obtain the Medici and Venetian cape, however, Project Legacy has been shut down since 2013, as a result, the only way to unlock these 2 capes is by downloading an old save from someone else who managed to get the Venetian and Medici capes while Assassin's Creed Project Legacy was still around.",1579011726,1579011726,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics: 8/10
Story: 2/10
Combat: 3/10
Movement: 6/10
Pacing: 2/10
Overall: 4/10

While AC2 felt like a direct upgrade from AC1, ACB has the pleasure of feeling like a direct downgrade from its predecessor. While still not as user-unfriendly as AC1 the ""story"" of the game was simply horrible at almost all times. You start with the story mode simply being how-to for side missions, and only in the last few sections does it actually pick up and then you have a lot of action for a short while and the game is over. If you removed all the fluff the game would be half an hour at most. It felt more like a DLC to AC2 than an actual stand-alone game. It did give some neat continuation to AC2 story but that content was just about 15 minutes of the total game.
The graphics were amazing which was one of the saving graces of the game, although not better than in AC2 from what I could see. So in that matter it's kind of a bummer but it was still good to look at. That is pretty much where the good points end.
Combat-wise the opponents can grab you again which may sound like it makes the combat more advanced like in AC1 but that is not the case - countering the grab just makes them even easier targets, and in this one you can actually chain executions meaning as soon as you counter one opponent you can chain until the entire army is dead with them not being able to do anything. While chaining some of them may try to attack you but you can just counter them mid-chain and then keep the other chain going. Ridiculously easy combat, wasn't even fun after the first few battles. Stealthy double-executions were locked until you were already at 30% completion (which was about 7 hours in for me) which was silly considering you had that in AC2 with the same protagonist. It just felt off.
UI now thankfully shows the buttons you need to press for actions instead of just icons but my god are they horribly chosen. Instead of WASD and space+shift you have to control the menus with arrow keys and enter+backspace. You can't even change the keys in options! Who in the world thought backspace would be a good idea to exit a menu?!
Now to the more technical side of the game. Let's start with the fact that the game kept crashing over and over to the point where I dropped the game for a few months due to being pissed at how poorly the game works. I crashed 20 times a day easily, if not more. My computer could easily handle the graphics at maximum so it wasn't the case of that. The game also had countless bugs and glitches that just took the immersion right out. Some examples - got into an endless loop of an air-execution a few times where the character just kept jumping on top of one guy until I smashed my face on the keyboard to get him out of that, maps aren't stitched properly meaning you have to actually sprint-jump over flat surfaces because there's a one pixel gap in the world, the minimap isn't even stitched properly throughout the game (but at least it works now unlike in AC2 where it showed a random position), multiple times the game actually altered my jumping course midair causing me to fall down (a few times to my death even), enemies can spawn a mere few meters from your face (causing missions where you have to not get caught to fail instantly), and in the final boss fight I had to actually lower my screen to 60hz for the game to work! The final cutscene didn't trigger and I went online to see why the game won't continue properly and apparently 144hz resolution breaks the game at that point. Even after I had set it to 60hz the boss became untargetable and passive in his final phase so I had to restart the fight all over.
Some design choices weren't the best either (some of them may even also be bugs, I have no idea at this point) - horses can't jump even a tiny bit downwards. If you're trying to jump from one platform to another then it has to be higher than the one you're on for the horse to do the jump. That leads to some jumps being able to be performed only from one side despite the other way being a way easier jump realistically. There are very very tiny ledges that the character can grab but not giant ropes that are hanging. Speaking of ledges sometimes you pretty much have to know which textures you can grap onto because many rough models you can't climb onto but some minor bumps on the wall are perfectly grabbable. As if that wasn't enough the forced camera angles make you miss many jumps!
Timed bonus objectives are a lot harder than in AC2 but overall the game is a lot easier if you don't count the bugs and design choices (which arguably do make the game harder than AC2). Horrible climbing mechanics combined with timed bonus objectives is not a very good result. There are ""truth"" collectibles in this game as well that you can only see in Eagle Vision mode but upon finding some of them they can not be accessed because the story has not progressed far enough for you to be able to reach them which is extremely annoying because the game doesn't save the location on the map for future reference.
Overall the game was not good at all, and in the end I had to push myself to even finish it. At least I got a couple of minutes of story that matters in the total run.",1577998248,1577998248,False,0,0,0.45611611008644104,0,True,False,False

Combat is utter nonsense, hampered further by controls that are even worse than the first game. The story still sucks.

So lets look on Pros and Cons:-

Pros:- 
1. The main story line is still good, especially towards the end where some interesting things happen <3
2.Great Voice Acting Makes You Care About The Eclectic Ensemble Cast.
3. You can make your own Assassin's guild where you recruit citizens to your guild, train them by sending them on missions and you can summon them in battle which is the most effective way to tackle many missions while remaining in the shadows.
4. Economy system where you can rebuild Rome and earn income from landmarks or shops you rebuild. 
5..The Borgia family controlling Rome is a 'bad guy' you can see the effects of. Gaining control over the city actually feels like something that matters, as opposed to this vague assassins vs templars thing that has lasted for three straight games and still never gets anywhere.
Cons :-
1. Camera Spazes Out At Times.

Brotherhood is very similar to ACII, close enough to maintain a degree of excellence. I am very glad that they decided to remain in the same setting and explore these characters further, it definitely pays off. Ezio continues his development into being a wise master of the craft, whilst managing to keep his roguish charm and charisma. The supporting cast is just as strong as the last game, and in fact features many return characters. Rome is a wonderful setting. The gameplay remains incredibly fluid and enjoyable. I would say that the story is slightly weaker than the previous instalment, though just barely. The main reason I am not rating this just as highly is because it is so similar to ACII, and rests on the laurels of that titles success. This is far from a problem, but it does mean that it is far less ground-breaking. This doesn’t detract from it being a brilliant game",1574338147,1574338147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story picks up where it ended in AC2 and it takes place in Rome this time. The main story line is way shorter but there is so much you can do outside of the story that the whole game feels way longer.
Lets take a look at pros and cons, shall we ?

[b][i]Pros (+)[/i][/b]
+ The main story line is still solid, especially towards the end where a lot of cool stuff happens.
+ Guild system where you can do missions and challenges for Mercenary Guild, Thief Guild and Courtesans Guild. If you manage to do all of their challenges, you will obtain some of the very best gear in the game.
+ You can make your own Assassin's guild where you recruit citizens to your guild, train them by sending them on missions and you can summon them in battle which is the most effective way to tackle many missions while remaining in the shadows.
+ Secret locations are pretty good and diverse.
+ Economy system where you can rebuild Rome and earn income from landmarks or shops you rebuild. The money can be then used to hire NPC's, buy new gear or consumnables or maps of all kinds of collectibles. There is also option to invest in any shop and if you are lucky, you can earn quite a bit of profit.
+ First AC game that has an achievement system with quite a lot of them to collect.
+ Database with information on all important landmarks and NPC's.
+ Good selection of weapons, armor sets and outfits to choose from. Many of them are earned for completing different objectives.
+ Couple of missions that feature different war machines like tank, cannon, machine gun (primitive version) and bomber.
+ Improved graphics compared to AC2 and better performance (much less random stuttering and FPS drops).
+ Great soundtrack as always. Voice acting is also superb.
+ Extremely stable and well optimized. Not a single crash or freeze in almost 60 hours.

[b][i]Cons (-)[/i][/b]
- This one is seriously annoying and it was one of the two things that really made me hate the game sometimes: most of the missions has optional requirements which you have to fullfill to obtain 100% synchronization required for 100% completion. This is by far the most frustrating thing this game could do because it strictly limits your options how you want to complete the mission. Most of the time, you either have to kill your enemy in certain way or with specified weapon and any other kill will make you fail. Many missions are also timed if you are aiming for 100% sync which I personally hate since I enjoy playing at my pace and not to rush.
There is also great amount of missions where you can't be detected or take any damage as requirement for 100% sync which can be extremely frustrating at times and you can spend even hours trying to do some of the missions, for example Hell on Wheels mission with tank, where you can't take any damage while inside the tank (doesn't make sense) or you will fail and the whole mission is like 20-30 minutes long so if you fail, good luck again.

- The second issue I had with the game was camera (same problems I had with previous 2 AC games) where the camera will just randomly change or it will position in a way where you absolutely have no idea in what direction to jump and you can keep failing a lot because of this, especially in those timed missions. It might not be such an issue with controller but on keyboard, it is very frustrating. Fortunately, it's only in couple of missions and not during regular gameplay.

[b][i]Conclusion[/i][/b]
Very solid game that offers a lot of different content to choose from. A lot was improved since AC2 and some tedious tasks were removed to make the game less repetitive and more interesting to play. I have not felt bored at any point in the game and even after 100% completion, I was kinda sad that it was already over. I found the game enjoyable, except few very frustrating missions.

[b]I would recommend it to AC fans[/b]. If you enjoyed AC2 then this one is no-brainer and you should play it as well.",1574278312,1574278885,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

I loved seeing slowly how the Brotherhood was rebuilt as the Borgia's influence was slowly destroyed, all resulting in a climactic and beautiful finale, both for this chapter of Ezio's story, and of Desmond's. There are a few complaints I have- the unavailability of certain trade items and difficulty in obtaining them, the forced camera angles in certain sections that completely mess with the controls, and how seemingly impossible some of the 100% Sync tasks were. But still, in my book, AC Brotherhood is indeed a good game.",1573952414,1573952414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After the brilliance of Assassin's Creed II firmly set the series in the main stream Ubisoft decided to use Ezio again this time making things a bit more mature, Ezio is older in this game and after the brilliant opening that picks right up where Ezio's story in AC2 left off we truly can tell this game is pulling out anything it can and I love it. Desmond's story is also continued to a somewhat surprising and bittersweet climax. Overall the gameplay is definitely an improvement over AC2 however the story isn't *as* strong, it's not weak by any means it's just not as powerful as Ezio's coming of age tale.

In terms of gameplay, it's basically the same of AC II, but it's the plot that is really amazing. While still being a story of revenge, it gets more complicated/detailed (all characters are much more fleshed out, instead of just being there) and finishes the unconcluded story of AC II. In fact, I still don't understand why it isn't called AC III. Without playing this game you wouldn't follow what's happening in the actual AC III!
Plus, the reconstruction of Rome is almost perfect and that's a big bonus if you love Roman History.

- The story is more of what we see in AC2, usual Ezio stuff, maybe lacks some dept but still good.
- Gameplay is less clunky and many actions are easier to do and lighter on the mind/body of the player.
- Combat system has received a ""Combo"" system that lets you 1 shot enemies in succession, some people like it, some don't. Personally i think it's good for the amount of enemies the game throws at you, but it feels too easy at times
- Stealth is still good and better than previous AC games.
- Brotherhood system is really good and fun to play with.
- Secondary missions are better than 2, this time they threw some dept into them.
- Collectibles are similar to AC2, still good but slightly less engaging.
- You can replay story missions and achieve full completitions by doing some small secondary objective, a nice addition.

Overall this game has many more things to do than AC2 and they are funnier. The map also feels more alive than the AC2 cities, but the story could be better.

I can only recommend this game as I think is one of the best in the series. Took me 50 hours to complete 100% and achievements. Don't bother with multiplayer, it's shitty optimized and barely anyone plays it anymore.",1573216077,1573216663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

>Pros: 
+Graphics are slightly improved in regards to ACII
+Art direction once again shining through, game looks great even nowadays
+Rome liberation and rebuilding mechanics are very fun
+Some nice character moments

>Cons:
-A LOT of pop-in, terrible draw distance
-Story feels like filler
-Some extra side-story missions locked behind repetitive mundane sidequests
-Last section of the game is extremely rushed plot-wise
-Some tombs in the game still require a level of finesse the game just doesn't have
-Climbing mechanics are still very wonky
-Side missions are terribly repetitive
-Animations can be very buggy
-Terrible inexcusable stutter throughout the game
-Recruiting assassin's and managing them feel reminiscent of mobile games
-Combat is way too easy, parry window is enormous

Brotherhood was a very mediocre experience. It had very fun moments, but was extremely boring and repetitive at points, wearing it's welcome out. That and the fact that it fails to improve a lot of issues from Assassin's Creed II makes it really hard to recommend the game. Except for one very specific moment at the very end of the game the plot feels mostly inconsequential to the larger scheme, feel free to skip this one and just watch some YouTube videos if you're into the AC storyline.",1571501658,1572722121,False,2,0,0.471591383218765259,0,True,False,False

Story: Just like AC2, the story is fantastic and extremely captivating. I recommend you play AC2 first because you won't have any idea what's going on in the beginning of this game. The plot, the world and the main characters are interesting and unique. The game is a lot shorter than AC2 but the new features make up for this. Plus, the story seems better paced and less dragged out in this entry.

Graphics: AC2 had amazing scenery but odd looking characters. The cities and landscapes were beautiful and very artistic but characters' faces were wierd and choppy . AC Brotherhood improves on both of these aspects. On the highest graphical settings, AC Brotherhood displays more environmental and character textures than AC2. This game took AC2 and made it prettier.

Sound: Again, the sounds and music of AC2 make a return in AC Brotherhood along with some new tracks. The sound and music never fails in this game. The sound, music, and voice acting are phenomenal.

Controls: If you have played AC2, there is virtually no difference. I recommend you use a controller for a smoother experience.

Gameplay: Everything from AC2 is back and more. New mission types have been added and Ubisoft have made sure that there aren't a ridiculous amount of missions this time around. Now, there are less missions but each one feels unique and dynamic. In a addition, there is now a new streak-kill mode in which enables you to instantly kill enemies as long as they are part of a combo chain. Also, you get new items which I will not spoil, but are awesome nonetheless. The villa building function of AC2 makes a return, except this time the entire city of Rome is yours to play with. You can buy and renovate shops and property around the city which will allow you to receive income every 20 minutes. The more you renovate, the more money you'll make. You can even buy historic landmarks if you are rich enough. Yes, you can buy the coliseum! Also, you can now invest in shops if you want to. But probably the newest feature is the ability to recruit and train your own assassins. You can send them on missions to level up or you can use them to call for aid in battle.The assassins can eventually become master assassins of their own with upgraded armor, weapons and skills. 

Verdict: 9.5/10 
Honestly, I believe AC Brotherhood took what made AC2 good and made it better. It's prettier, the story is great and the new gameplay features make the game feel more dynamic and real. AC Brotherhood is in my opinion the perfect AC game in the series. The city of Rome is huge and diverse and you even get to visit cities from AC2 in some missions. Even the cutscenes seem more high quality and action-oriented. This game is a work of art.",1565693975,1572066279,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

To me they are just huge maps littered with never ending boring chores.
The mechanics were crappy back than and are absolutely abysmal now. The traversal is slow and sloppy, the fights mostly just countering everyone, most missions are comprised of following people and then killing some people... -_-
I tried to limit myself to doing just the main missions in hope this could be at least somewhat fun but even they are so bland...
And even if they were amazing (which they are NOT) - what is the point of creating such a big world if it's so mundane and repetitive?
Anyways, I got this game because it was so cheap during the sale and I wanted to finally see what happened to Ezio after ACII but I just cannot force myself to play this atrocity any more!

[h1][b]What's to like?[/b] [i]Assassin's Creed II expanded to whole new quality[/i]:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Rome in the age of Renaissance, which might not be that great, but I did enjoyed it;
[*]Again build in library of information, which for me was very nice;
[*]Another chapter of life beloved Ezio with many interesting ideas;
[*]Expanded: Economic system made at the whole Rome with possibility to invest into shops;
[*]Expanded: Shops have quest, so some of the inventory is only aquired by solving those (which is only collecting resources);
[*]Expanded: Assassin's Tombs modified into Romulus Lair, which wasn't that great as previous but enjoyable;
[*]Expanded: Side Quest of Guilds are written into plot;
[*]Expanded: Assasinations are limited and spread across every sequence;
[*]Expanded: [b]New Combat System is much more dynamic and also demanding[/b];
[*]Added: Possibility to replay memory and rules making the 100% sync much more demanding;
[*]Added: Strategic system, overtaking parts of Rome as the fight with the Borgia Army;
[*]Added: Every Guild has challenges (Assassins, Courtesans, Thieves and Mercenaries), which upon completing all gives you new weapons in the Hideout;
[*]Added: Leonardo's Machines, great external levels with nice action and of cource the machines itself;
[*]Added: Templar Agents, way to introduce some of the multiplayer character within story, it's like high level assasination;
[*]Added: Memories of Cristina, which are nice closure for those who wondered what happen with the love of Ezio;
[*]Return: of collecting flags from first Assassin's Creed, which upon completing gives new cape for Ezio;
[*]Added: Virtual Training, which is good way to get yourself around new combat system and other parts.
[/list]

[h1]What might reduce fun?[/h1]
[list]
[*]Exploration of Rome and taking over, should be locked through first few sequences (to Seq 5), because it kind of looses continuity;
[*]The Da Vinci Disappearence DLC, when you add it through UPlay, it shows access right away, which shouldn't be accesable until like Sequence 9 or even after completing main story;
[*]Copernicus Conspiracy DLC, doesn't fit at all in any sequence, so it like super side quest with no point, except that [spoiler]Copernicus is ex-Templar[/spoiler] and one of the Templars we kill is a another multiplayer character;
[*]Deluxe Edition's - Helmschmied Drachen Armor Skin should be as either indestructable armour obtainable in some extra quest or just buyable one, personally I'd prefered it as part of the game, not just cosmetics thing;
[*]collecting Treasures is still monotonny and kind of pointless with new economic system (lesser amount would be better, in my opinion) only thing it helps throughout is completing Shop Quest;
[*]also collecting feathers (only 10 of them) doesn't give any satisfaction or any item;
[*]again the flaw in the game (for me) with sudden changes of camera viewpoint with change of directional control, wasn't fixed for PC version, which gives trouble with some of the quest when there's time limit.
[/list]

Considering all above, I'll say the game is worth playing and exploring. Grand extension of previous game, it's Assassin's Creed II Plus

The main story will take [b]causal player[/b] about [b]24 to 28 hours[/b], but with focusing on all the side quests, extras,collectibles and guild challenges - up to [b]50 hours[/b].",1567424136,1567424236,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also the hills of Roma will cause a lot of pain to walk or ride between distant locations, simply because Ezio constantly has to find a way to move between low and high altitudes.
The missions (at least from my perspective) are more of a burden than in the previous game. The 100% sync system and the strict timers make you forget that AC is meant to be an open-world game.

[h1] Assassins Creed Brotherhood Pc port 5.5/10 [/h1]

I recall this game well from when I played it back in the days on PS3, so it isn't a bad game by any means. The PC port however is as often with Ubisoft games very very bad. First of all it requires the abomination that is Uplay to run and the controls for keyboard and mouse as well as controller are hilariously bad resulting in a fair amount of tweaking before even being playable. 

Besides this, for me atleast the game is broken to the point I cannot continue. This is almost immediately when the game starts during the cannon mission where the time (villagers saved) runs out atleast 1.5 as fast as it is supposed to, making me fail over and over again. Before you say git good scrub. I have completed this game multiple times already on PS3 and have checked with 5+ Youtube tutorials that are noticably less accurate and still easily pass this mission. 

(Edit: this mission seems to be broken when played on 144hz, switch to 60 Hz and the mission should be more doable I actually passed the mission when the counter somehow completely glitched out and dissapeared but it should fix the issue)

If you played the previous two, you're gonna enjoy it for what it is and get more of the general plot, and be amazed how they just didn't fix many annoying things like the jumping system not working and so on.
Oh and don't think you're gonna get a 100% synch (basically optional objectives) in all the missions, as some of those are simply impossible to be done on the first playthrough and some of them are gonna get ruined by stupid AI, those clumsy controls or other nonsense occassions. Otherwise, I enjoyed all of those 15+ hours, and I do not regret playing it. But I probably will not do it again ever. I don't know how much it costs now, but definitely wait for the sale.

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft.

Like in previous entries, game features two storylines, both starting right after AC2 ending. (Highly recommended to play it before this game.)
In Modern Day, Desmond and his crew managed to escape Abstergo and now they are looking for more clues regarding Piece Of Eden. To find them, Desmond jumps back into the Animus, back into memories of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, who just discovered the Vault and returns to Monteriggioni. However, soon he will have to fight Borgia once again! 

Brotherhood just like previous games, features open world you can fully explore, but this time it's mainly focused on one, huge location, with few missions outside of it instead of few smaller hubs like 2 previous games used to. This change has not really influenced the gameplay, besides getting a bit repetitve in last sequences where you explored Rome fully and have to wander around in same locations. 
However exploration of it remained the same. Some of the places are locked until further sequences, so you won't feel overwhelmed by amount of activities and content. 
And there is a lot of content. If you will need to take a break from main storyline missions, you can complete activities, from gathering chests and flags, clearing out tombs, and helping out guilds in their own problems, to races, challenges, or by simply sightseeing Rome in it's not-that-bright-anymore glory. 
Why? Mostly thanks to Borgia, which brings me to new elements in the game. 

As a centre of their power, to bring Borgia down you will need to take down captains and their towers setup all over the city. This will help you in your missions, as it will make them easier, and it will allow you to rebuild this part of the city. 
Rome was not build in a day, and so it won't be rebuild in a day aswell. Ruined and devasted, you need to dive deep into your pockets to renovate shops, aqueducts, and tunnels used to fast travel around the map. The more you renovate, the more money you gather from banks, allowing you to buy more things! (And to renovate more buildings.) And the process goes on.
You can spend money in the same way as in AC2-to buy weapons and armor, paintings, buildings, or to hire faction members which will help you. 

Obviously you are not the only one who hates new masters of Rome. Some of the citizens tried to take the matter into their own hands, but failed. However, if you will take them under your wings, you can shape them into Assassins, helping you out in the fights and distraction. At first, with only basic armor and weapon, they might be weak, but as they gather expierience by sending them into combat, or into contract missions, you can upgrade them so they become a ruthless force on a battlefield. 
They also have a warp technology, allowing them to pop up from thin air from any place on the map! Just call them, and they will come. 

One of the new elements featured is synchronization. While in previous games, completing a memory would be enough, in Brotherhood to get full synchronization you need to perform a secondary task which Ezio did. Those are fairly simple, ""kill x using y weapon"", ""Don't get spotted"", ""Use x only"" and so on. Most of them is enjoyable and easy to complete, yet add a interesting challenge! 

Combat itself remained the same. Use weapons, moves, and enviroment to elimiate your opponents. To Ezio's wide arsenal, game added crossbow. Silent, kills every enemy with one bolt. Very accurate, deadly, yet expensive. As for close combat, one major change which, if you ask me, can be considered gamebreaking (or combatbreaking, atleast.) 
Killstreaks. After killing an enemy, you can aim at a second one, get closer, and one-hit eliminate him, and continue to do that until you run out of enemies. As you might expect, it changes every fight into a bloodbath, as you can kill one weakest enemy and then just mash M1 to kill everyone. Right, you also, from time to time, need to counter enemy attack, after which you can still go on with your killstreak. This breaks the combat to the point where 1v2 or 1v10 fights are the same level of difficulty. And none of the enemies besides last boss, can counter you and break your killstreak! I don't understand why it is in the game. It ruins the whole combat. 

If you will get tired of Single Player, game introduces the Multiplayer mode! In order to prepare new Templar agents for the fight against the Assassins, our lovely Abstergo prepared this Animus-based training program. Be the hunter, and the hunted at the same time in simple assassination modes, solo or with team. 

Optimized as good as AC 2, had no issues with how game runs. 

Music was composed by Jesper Kyd, and I'm very happy for that as soundtrack is just as fantastic as in previous AC titles he worked on. Ezio's english accent from AC 2 also has been fixed, while rest of the voice actors didn't have to fix anything, they do great job! 

With fantastic location, intriguing storyline, and mostly same gameplay, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a great continuation of Ezio story. 8/10!

Unlike AC2 which had multiple cities, ACB is set almost entirely in Rome. To compensate for being in only one location, it is a lot bigger than AC2s cities. I quite liked Rome as a setting. You've got a nice mixture of Renaissance Rome, Roman Ruins and the countryside as well as the Vatican. 

You get the same type of gameplay as in AC2. You've got your story missions which has you working against and assassinating the Templars and their agents in Rome. Theres loads of side missions like Assassination Contracts, Tombs etc and the usual collectables. 

Theres a few new gadgets to use too. The main new feature introduced in this game is that you can now recruit and train your own assassins. And with the press of a button you can call them to aid you in taking down guards and enemies. It's actually a really useful addition and can be quite helpful during missions. 

On the negative side, I don't think the game has aged very well. The game is kind of less impressive now than it was when I played it on release as it's sort of plagued by the Ubisoft open world formula that has become a endemic in their later games. 

While the game ran ok without any major issues, I did encounter one mission that was almost broken. Without spoiling much there is a mission where you have to pilot a glider. Only problem for me is the controls would stop working randomly during the mission leading me to crash or fly off the edge of the map failing the mission. I googled the problem and found it sometimes occurs on monitors with a refresh rate higher than 60Hz. Apparently setting the resolution to 60Hz and enabling VSync is supposed to help the problem. Unluckily for me my screen is hard set at 120Hz. After an hour of trial and error  and thanks to having a few checkpoints (and a lot of swearing) I managed to beat that particular mission but it's something I never want to do again. So while it's not a guaranteed problem, theres a risk it could occur depending on your monitor.

Anyway overall though AC Brotherhood is still a pretty good game and one of the more worthy entries in the AC series. If you played and liked AC2 and want to experience the next part of Ezios story than it is worth playing.",1563488898,1563488898,True,4,0,0.584026575088500977,0,True,False,False

Continuing story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze is wonderful, so nice story. The thing I liked the most is that I can create BROTHERHOOD, that's why this is called like that, Brotherhood vs. Borgia Power was fuc**** great. Ezio's uncle, Mario, was killed, the saddest moment. Desmond's part was the weirdest. I'm so curious what's going in the next game.

I recommend you this game 100%! First you have to play Assassin's Creed or Assassin's Creed II , first game is not necesary. but second one is important to understand the story.

In every assassins creed there is always that one moment that will completely get you hooked on the story. If its not betrayal, its action. If its not action, its Just sheer story and many other reasons get you hooked on this series. Yes there is a few bugs here and there like AI's glitching out and missions sometimes not loading correctly but its a game that was made in 2011 and it hasnt had any HD version of it made.... not that it needs it but if they did remaster this game i would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with one extra thing to add, to get the full story on whats happening you kinda need to play it from assassins creed 1- well this game unless you watch videos of it online. 10/10 for me. Amazing experience and one i wouldnt want anyone to miss out on!

As a fan of the assassins creed series since i was younger i have managed to play and complete every assassins creed to 100% completion and i have followed story of all assassins creed games to the full extent, including the comics.( PS- the missing acheivements for the recent games of assassins creed origins and odyssey, steam somehow cant unlock them for me)",1563476812,1563477874,True,9,2,0.611423254013061523,0,True,False,False

The game really didn't start strong. The first mission is basically impossible to complete unless you tweak temporarily framerate, resolution, and VSync. Yes, you need to change graphics settings in order to pass a mission. This happened two or three more times. Nothing serious, but very annoying.

Anyway back to the game. This is actually the first Assassin's Creed I can safely recommend. There are so many improvements over AC2. First, finally, FINALLY, there is only one map with overall fewer districts (viewpoints). Second, Ubisoft took fun little economic mechanic from Monteriggioni, so now you can build the whole Rome and earn cash. Third, a completely new mechanic – Assassin's Guild. This new element of the game really hit the nail on the head. Fourth, added fun challenge via additional mini quests to fully synchronize memory. Fifth, collectibles are easier to obtain thanks to maps you can buy. Something desperately missing from the previous installment.

There are still few things I don't like, namely tailing someone (it's extremely boring), the technical aspect of the game (still full of bugs) and some vertical design of Rome (some hills have only one way in).

Overall, the story is still the main selling point of Assassin's Creed. The mix of sci-fi and history is perfect. Although I would still prefer more present sequences.",1557627388,1557627575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- You can renovate shops around the city and earn income from them, provided that you destroy Borgia towers beforehand.

- You now have a brotherhood of assassins who will provide you aid during combat or outside of it. Summoning them requires a gauge that needs to charge overtime. Hold to release a barrage of arrows on your enemies, or tap to summon individual assassins.

The story for brotherhood is another great tale to follow. I'm really interested in Ezio's timeline so this game increased that further. Im glad the nature of Ezio and assassins stayed throughout this game. One of my favourite features from brotherhood is the guild system. Allowing you to recruit, train and use againest the enemy was so brilliant. I loved calling in my assassins and causing a massive battle to happen in the street. 

The world and location was set in Rome. The absolute perfect place in my opinion as I really enjoyed exploring what Rome had to offer. Great icons such as the Pantheon and the Colosseum were incredible to see. Some parts of the map were fairly open but riding on horseback allowed ease of access across these areas. I loved seeing iconic figures pop up throughout the story. Really helps understand the era and what was going on during this period in history. Graphics were an improvement as well. 

The free running was improved in this game I feel. I didn't get stuck as much as in AC2. More fluid with a couple new parkour mechanics. Combat was counter and kill. It was a pretty easy system to learn and you could easily take down anyone. Stealth was also an option as well. An interesting feature was optional objectives. An extra job to complete that made re think your initial strategy was welcomed. 

Overall the second game for Ezio was a success in my opinion. Great setting, improved graphics and some amazing new features to the table.

Game design choices during the Leonardo side missions and odd controller/movement interface makes this game very frustrating for casual gamers. Too much Dieing & Trying (i.e desynchronizing of memories).

Writing for main protagonist Ezio and for plot is better than in AC2. Meta games (for me one highlight in AC2) have more variety than in predessor.

I'm torn between having tremendous fun when it's working for me and cursing AC:B to hell when it's not. The only thing that keeps me going is the promise of a backstory relevant to the AC lore.

From Assassins Creed 2, to Brotherhood, it was a whole change. The fighting mechanics are so freaking good! It is so satisfying to fight in this one. This time we have one big map, but with a whole new system. I really liked that you could buy shops, invest in them, and buy structures. That was pretty cool. 

A new system with recruiting assassins is also available. That, i really liked.

The thing that didn't go up to me that well, was the story. The story compared to Assassins Creed 2 was not that good in my opinion, it was a fine story, easy to forget in my opinion. In this one i liked that they had expanded Desmonds story a lot more, so we know a lot more about that. It was also good to see Da Vinci again.

However, be prepared for the age of this one - not just the graphics engine (which I would argue is quite acceptable really) but more in terms of the gameplay sophistication.  There are a number of nuances which just are not yet present - lots of poor choices in the run/jump and especially in dropping (where Ezio seems to want to grab every damn thing on the way down except when you want him to).  The combat is pretty lacklustre, and the escape from combat is moronic. The quests are very much 'on rails', which the later examples don't feel quite so beholden to.  For the completionists, the 100% stuff is sometimes absurd, and really only there to extend your gametime (to whit, you'll be doing stuff over and over due to pure random rubbish). In fact, a heck of a lot of stuff in the main quest line is gametime extension just for the hell of it - reusing assets but closing specific doors, etc.  Its not terribly inventive, and get really pointlessly tiring at times.  Again, this is perhaps a sign of the times, but regardless is likely to break you out of enjoyment for a lot of face-palm and deep sigh moments.  Or you could just chuck the controller through the screen.  Your choice.

However the plot is the usual stuff, and the characters are pretty standard.  Its fun, but frustrating.  Worth playing through for the sake of it, but not a great example of a franchise whose latest offerings are so much more polished and well thought through (the French one ignored of course).",1550616350,1550955621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I get a strong feeling everytime I play a Ubisoft game, and that feeling is: any other game developer studio could have done it better, but Ubisoft has the title and the money.
I recommend the game, because I love it.
My point is that every single aspect of the game has been done by somebody else - better.
Bethesda or 2003 Bioware, Obsidian and many others if you want a greater story. Rockstar, if you want a flawless game, CD Project if you want an epic, but not Rockstar-like game.
Of course, never EA because they are equally bad as Ubisoft.
As it happens, every title that ever got EA'd or Ubisoft'd, became a bit more of a disappointment than it was.
Heroes of Might and Magic, for an example. EA? Star Wars Battlefront I-II.
This game is early-Ubisoft. Back then, they were only developing the idea of draining every drop of blood from their victims to monetize them - the drops of blood, one by one, each for 0,99$. Like in Assassin's Creed Rogue, you can purchase ""time savers"". Functions, that are normally included in the game, but not at Ubisoft.

Assasin's Creed Brotherhood is good. It's just badly... optimized? Your point of view is often fixed when it shouldn't be, your targeting system often switches targets just before you press the fire button, sometimes you try to follow 2 guards, kill one, but for the next kill you suddenly stab a villager who just came along. Why? For me, killing a guard then advancing toward the next in order to perform another assassination means I'm off to kill soldiers, not that I want to kill some innocent by-passer. Why would I? Why would I risk to lose my cover? The game handles it's sh*it stupid.

Still, it very well may be the best AC game of all time, and it's 2019. Other good titles are Origins, Rogue, AC I - II. I recommend this game but I also pray for that somebody else gets the rights to execute AC projects, and not EA, and then again, it's a great game, play it, buy it, you won't find better.",1550683373,1550683373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The multiplayer in Brotherhood is [u]amazing[/u] and one of the greatest things in any Assassin's Creed ever. Unfortunately, there is no playerbase anymore, so it's virtually unplayable. If I took it into account the rating for this game would be even higher, probably my highest in the series. Also, I have reviewed other games in the series so if you like this be sure to look for those as well...[/b]

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a [u]noble[/u] continuation of the series. In contrast to 2, which improved upon its predecessor in nearly every way imaginable, Brotherhood made an immense leap forward with its multiplayer introduction, but started a nasty trend of feature creep in the main game.
 
At its core, Brotherhood is AC2. Personally, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I know some may worry this just feels like a DLC, but it’s definitely got enough meat to the bone to make it worth as a separate release, especially since it had multiplayer. In my mind, AC2 is one of my favorite games of all time, and arguably my favorite in the series. I’ve got no problem with it being so similar. However, as [i]it is[/i]so similar, and I’ve already reviewed AC2, I’ve decided for this review to focus on why I think Brotherhood is not as good as AC2. If you want to know the positives of this game, look at that review. Once again, this is without factoring in the multiplayer.
 
The events of Brotherhood directly follow the end of Assassin's Creed 2, which has Desmond, Lucy, Rebecca, and Shaun, flee to Monteriggioni to continue Desmond's exploration in the animus, while Ezio discovers that there is more he will need to do to bring a true end to the Borgia.

Let me stop right here to say that as a player, at least, it's extremely frustrating this whole game basically exists because [spoiler]Ezio spared Rodrigo in AC2 instead of killing him like he [i]obviously[/i] should have,[/spoiler]but whatever. The story evolves into much more, especially with regard to Cesare, so it's not the worst thing of all time, but…

Anyway, Brotherhood introduces some new collectibles, a few characters, and some minor game mechanics, but little else. The big sell here is the story and the multiplayer.

In both games the visuals are great (they even hold up pretty well today I’d say), the atmosphere is captivating, the voice acting is [u]absolutely brilliant[/u], the pacing is good, the missions are fun, the combat is [i]so[/i] satisfying, and the collectible/side content is interesting (seriously, if you don't do the collectible/side content in AC2 or Brotherhood you're missing out on one of the best aspects of the games), and the ending is dare I say, [u]near perfect[/u] 

However, here are the reasons I don’t think Brotherhood is as good as 2...

1) The city management is boring and unnecessary. This got started with Monteriggioni in AC2 and I didn't like it then, so I didn't want it to continue. Unfortunately, it did. I like renovating the faction houses because they serve a useful purpose in the game play, but the rest to me is silly. It doesn't affect gameplay hardly at all, and it's just an unnecessary time sink that they wasted development time on.

2) The same can be said about “Assassin contracts”. You can look hoenstly at Brotherhood and see the beginning of mobile gaming bleeding into top-tier AAA games. I remember distinctly seeing online advertisements ""send your brotherhood on missions across Europe!"" as if it was something exciting or interesting. It's not. It's boring and it's pathetic game design.

In truth, the assassin recruits aspect is good. In many cases the missions in Brotherhood are much more difficult, and Ubisoft made many of the enemies tougher, so you really need to use your assassin recruits. However, creating some type of progression system for them was unnecessary, if you ask me.

The assassin recruits aren't amazing though, either. Sometimes their availability makes missions [u]too[/u] easy. There is a mission where you must kill a target in less than 5 minutes for ""full synch"" but in the first 5 seconds if you hold down the button for the assassin recruits to perform an arrow storm he’ll dies instantly… making 100% full synch, something supposed to be a major challenge, literally as easy as pressing LB/L1 for 2 seconds. 

On other missions you're [i]required[/i] to use your assassin recruits to kill your target without being detected, but often times when you [i]do[/i] use them, the game says you were detected and you fail the mission. They're quite buggy and they could've used more polish.

3) Sequences 8 and 9, all the way up until you finally leave the animus and return to Desmond, are [u]terrible[/u]. AC2 has a drop in quality, too, Sequences 12, 13, and everything up until the Pope in sequence 14, but it’s even worse here. It really feels like the devs just gave up during these sequences. The lines [i]""Assassino! GUARDS!!!""[/i] Live in Assassin's Creed infamy because of this portion of the game, lol.

I know it may seem like I'm bagging on this game a lot, but I really do love it. It’s important to remember that I love AC2, and as a result, love Brotherhood. Yet, outside of the multiplayer, Brotherhood lacks any positive innovation. Rather, it introduced some disconcerting features.

Of course, once again, this is without scoring the multiplayer. If I did, Brotherhood would be tied for the best if not [i]the[/i] best in the series. I know this review was different from my typical style, but I hope you found it useful anyway. Thanks for reading!

If you've played the 2nd game and are attached to the characters, everything feels much more dire and painful when things don't go right for Ezio. And that much more satisfying when they do. The Modern Day arc is a bit more interesting than previous titles. The introduction of the ""brotherhood"" mechanics makes you feel like you're actually in control of events. Recruiting and training young assassins, using them in missions across Europe, and within the game. It's easy to get attached to particular ones, and then so sad when you make a mistake and they get killed.

Basically Assassin's Creed 2.5 in a way. Should have been the final part of Assassin's Creed 2, but has been stretched to a boring, long winded experience with boring, repetitive missions with no soul or character. Besides the noticeable enhancement in visuals, there are some (only some) good additions. Leonardo's side missions are a bit of fun, while the Romulus missions offer challenging parkour based objectives, and the new crossbow weapon is seriously overpowered. There's probably a reason the game doesn't tell you much about it or encourage you to acquire it. Not to mention, combat is extremely simplified now, which I actually like since it feels more fluid and satisfying to get kills. Also training fellow Assassins makes the game very easy, when it is already really easy.

The story starts off ruining the dramatic ending to Assassin's Creed 2, removing any excitement I had for this story. Characters have less character and just act tired a lot, like the voice actors lost their souls while recording. Even Ezio isn't fun to watch anymore, when he used to have somewhat diverse emotions. The main protagonist had potential, but only really seems interesting towards the final act, which is disappointing. Heck, even the Pope (Last seen in Assassin's Creed 2) is thrown to the back end here.

Overall, this game really bored me, which saddens me to say. While I got 100% in Assassin's Creed 2, I really could not be bothered in this game, despite the easier ways to collect collectables. Combat is too easy, the story is mostly unnecessary.

After playing AC 2, I thought that it would be hard to beat, as after playing it for the first time it currently stands as my favorite video game of all time.  While it didn't beat it, Brotherhood is still an incredible game.

The story is pretty good.  Once again you play as Ezio Auditore de Firenze.  It picks up right after the ending for AC 2.  After meeting Minerva in the vault underneath the Vatican, Ezio escapes with the Apple of Eden with the help of his Uncle, Mario.  Upon returning to Monteriggioni, life is good for a short time before everything comes crashing down again.  He ends up in Rome, once again setting out for revenge against the Borgia's.  The main story was a bit shorter than AC 2, but it was great.  There were a lot of great plot points, and it all had a really satisfying ending.

Gameplay was also really good.  Almost everything was improved over the last game.  Parkour felt really good, combat was great, stealth was improved upon, and there was more to accomplish.  They also added in a lot of new gameplay elements, including having your own assassins, and there was plenty of side content to keep me coming back.

The present day story was also awesome.  It picked up almost right where the last game left off.  Desmond and the rest of the gang have set up shop in the Villa Auditore.  He once again dives into the Animus to relive the memories of Ezio in order to learn the locations of the temples that were brought up at the end of AC 2.  There weren't a ton of major events in this story, but it had a very shocking ending, and ended with a cliffhanger.
In terms of the present day gameplay, there was a lot more to do in this game.  There wasn't any combat anywhere in the story, but there was a ton of parkour.  This was mostly due to the fact that you could actually go and explore Monterggioni in the present day.  There wasn't much there but for a few collectibles, but it was really cool.

The graphics were amazing.  I played on max settings, and it honestly looked better than some modern day games.  

The music was once again incredible.  They reused some music from AC 2 (Ezio's family and Earth just to name a couple of tracks) but there were plenty of new ones.  The music really added to the atmosphere of exploring Rome.

A couple of things to note:
I played with an Xbox One controller.
I didn't play any multiplayer.  From what I've heard it is good but it is also basically dead.  My advice is don't buy this for the sole purpose of playing multiplayer.

At the end of the day, I highly recommend this game.  I actually still haven't finished everything in the base game, and I haven't even touched any of the DLC content.  I will be updating this review for that content.  Anyway, get this game!

The Da Vinci Disappearance Review 

The Da Vinci Disappearance was a great DLC.  You can get it for free on U-Play, and it is totally worth it.  It takes place in 1506, a year before the ending of the actual game.  Leonardo Da Vinci has been kidnapped by the Templars to help them find the location of a hidden tomb, and it is up to Ezio to rescue him.  To do this, he must find several of Leo's painting, which lead to the crypt.  There was also a little bit that adds to the modern day story.  While there isn't any actual gameplay, you do learn a little bit about what happened to Desmond after the ending of the game.  The DLC will probably take you around an hour or two to complete, but it was fun the entire time.  Being as it is free on U-Play, you have no reason to skip this great content.",1549237572,1549731643,True,0,0,0.428613930940628052,0,True,False,False

ATTENTION
To fully understand the review, I recommend to read my Assassin's Creed II review first, as I will reference it probably a few times. It's not necessary to understand what I mean, though. At least I think so.

PROS
+ Missions were even better and was more vivid than in previous game
+ Controls were awesome (however I will also mention it in CONS section)
+ Despite the Rome was boring, the tombs were better
+ Game was even more interesting in the story matter
+ Borgia towers were great! It was better than just going on a viewpoint to synchronize - You actually had to defeat the enemy, then You could unlock it - whoever came with that idea, is a genius

CONS
- Horse AI was a tragedy - jumped over obstacles when he shouldn't and couldn't go trhough the smalles terrain irregularities when he should
- Jumping AI - come on... while in ACII the jumping was mostly accurate and intuitive, Brotherhood made something that Ezio jumped in wrong direction every now and then
- Controls and controller - Okay, I admit the controls were better... but sudden change from the AC2 was driving me crazy, when I killed civilain, when wanted just to tackle them. And I couldn't change it. Also map and vertical/horizontal camera was changed. The problem was, XBox controller, the same I used in ACII was working perfectly fine... but I was unable to change controls. It was disabled for some reason and I was making technical mistakes cause I used controls of ACII instead of new ones; As I said, the controls were better, but after first game, was confusing and being unable to change controller's controls was really uncool
- And again... no option to skip credits

So in the summary, story and the gamaplay were even cooler. However controller issues with AI of jumping/horse were so annoying. Still, game was pretty awesome.

RATING
Music: 10/10 Undoubtely, one of the best music I heard in games, super atmospheric
Story: I liked it a lot, but it's individual matter
Gameplay: 10/10 Pretty good
Controls: 5/10 Cause of the issues

I will recommend the game of course.",1548340068,1548340068,True,1,1,0.516460895538330078,0,True,False,False

Feel it's only fair to warn you that this game installs twice - once when you do so via Steam and again via UPlay inorder to play it - although since it's only 8GB I don't really mind but it takes longer than you'd expect and means you eventually have to uninstall it twice as well.

It also installs PunkBuster and doesn't give you a choice about that either and crashes when you alt-tab, but who cares, if that's the price of plaaying a great game then so be it.

Rome has the same feeling to it that Florence does in AC2 except that the city you start in is where your base upgrades can be used and that it's almost 5x the size that Florence was

The team-play parts with NPCs is good fun and it really feels like you're recruiting a team rather than collecting useless AIs. Horses are a feature during combat, which had me concerned at first, but not enough to put me off the game.

Additionally in this one you can leave the Animus at any time which makes it feel a bit more realistic than the earlier ones, where it was completely scripted when your character needed a break.

Very enjoyable, looking forward to replaying this further!

The game itself is, although rather identical, a step back from the previous game. It is definitely good in my eyes but some minor changes were made to controls and features which made me a bit sad. Just like with the previous game I had to search the internet for help that Ubisoft did not provide me. I had, like so many others, issues loading the game but managed to fix it after fiddling with additional programs. Very bad of Ubisoft to leave, yet again, a game's faults unattended. They did, however, add some new features to the game that I enjoyed, like the ability to call for help from additional assassins, so it is not all negative news!

My rating for this game will have to be an 8/10 ! 
Ubisoft, however, gets a 3/10.

Let's get to the negatives first, this game starts off really slow. For the first 5 hours, it drags on way too much. By the end of sequence 4, it gets a bit better paced, but until then, it's horribly slow.

And then the biggest issue I have with the game, it took everything that made AC2 bad, and didn't change it at all. Horrible physics, horrible controls, and the same side missions, but this time, the fucking flags are back. When I saw that, I just decided to not bother with side missions, and I just rushed through the story.

The positives, it had a better ending than AC2. It was much more rewarding and just better in every way. Cesare is also a slightly worse villain, but the boss battle against him is great.

Brotherhood also has everything that made AC2 good, and just makes it better, except for the story, which I felt was slightly weaker than AC2's. Better graphics, 'better' combat, and just everything that was good is just better, again except for the story.

The Cristina missions were also pretty good. They gave a nice and satisfying backstory to the moments we didn't see in AC2.

Conclusion: 
Why is AC: Brotherhood my best AC. Since I played AC1 up to Syndicate, I realized that the gameplay has been decreasing in quality ever since Brotherhood (except for Black Flag, their game mechanics is dope), and also the story quality is also decreasing after Revelations. 

First is that, what makes an AC game an AC game is because of both Assassin's and their story, specially from past up to present time (the modern day story). Ezio Trilogy gave us the best combination of both past and modern day story. After that, we've been receiving depreciating story quality ever since then specially AC 3 when they killed Desmond and Black Flag in which gave as an unnamed protagonist and also a Pirate who is so good in using a hidden blade without even proper training. 

How about the gameplay? AC 2 is a really good game. It had parachutes and stuffs like flying through the air. We don't have that in other AC and keep in mind that AC 2 was made in 2009. I really liked AC 2. But AC Brotherhood literally stepped up their game. They brought back the parachute and the flying thing that Leonardo made and that wasn't enough. They even made more like tank battle and so on. I feel like I'm playing a 2015+ game that was made on 2010 game. 

For the last statement, AC Brotherhood, is literally too good for his time (2015).",1541996480,1541996480,True,3,1,0.537656068801879883,0,True,False,False

I think this is my third playthrough of this game, and it's the one Assassin's Creed entry that I can safely say I'll play again.

Assassins's Creed Brotherhood takes everything that Assassin's Creed 2 did, and builds upon it. It reuses most assets from AC2, but don't let that fool you into thinking ACB is some sort of glorified expansion pack. Where AC2 could feel empty and spread out at times, ACB hones its focus on one location (Rome) and fills it with pure fun. If theres one city that perfectly fits the Assassin's Creed formula, it has to be Rome.

The main thing to say about ACB is that it's more AC2, but that it's also better. The landmarks are more fun to exlpore, with the Colesseum being a highlight. The missions are more varied and interesting, with a greater emphasis on stealth. The missions where you destroy Leonardo's war machines provide some nice gameplay variety. The Lairs of Romulus are a nice continuation of the Assassin's Tombs, and they feature some of the most challenging and satisfying platforming in the game. There are also Full Synchronization requirements now, which gives you incentive to replay missions to get 100%. The Brotherhood system is both fun and useful, from the recruiting to the contract management to using your recruits in actual gameplay. Having your brotherhood back you up on a mission makes you actually feel like an Assassin, and it's something that I wish the later games had included.

The story is improved, too. It has better pacing than AC2, focusing on a shorter time period, and keeps its focus on the struggle between Ezio and Cesare. The antagonists are now visually distinct and individually interesting, and while the lower-level Borgia leaders are underwritten, their character designs go a long way, helping to inform who they are and tell a visual story. This sort of artistic direction is something that AC2 lacked. Ezio is also explored further as a character, and his motivations and relationships are deepened, helping to flesh out his story. And Cesare Borgia is probably my favorite AC villain of all time - he's over the top and ridiculous, but his voice actor commits to the character, and the result is something special.

Overall, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is just a blast to play. Running on the rooftops of Rome, shooting guards with your crossbow, and calling in your recruits to kill your targets, all while remaining undectected - it's something that no other game has quite replicated. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is one of the few cases where the sequel is better than the original.",1538722549,1538722692,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The worst about this game is that half of Rome is actually hills with some houses or ruins in them. One of the most fun things in an Assassin's Creed game for me is to just get on a roof and do some parkour but that is nearly impossible in those areas which is really unfortunate because that makes travelling through that area kind of dull.

The economic system has been expanded, an assassin faction has been included, combat is faster-paced, the environments remain pleasant, virtual training activities that serve as benchmarkers for your personal skill in various tasks, and a multiplayer was introduced (though at the time of writing this review, it is quite vacant).

The writing remains consistently average, sometimes above, and Brotherhood's main storyline is notably shorter than its predecessor's. There are many nonessential (read: optional) quests and missions that can enhance or extend your playthrough. The majority of them are flavorless and it is best to play them as they become available, rather than waiting post-main storyline. The only exception being content associated with the Da Vinci Disappearance, which is more enjoyable after completing the main story.

The difficulty of the game is higher than its predecessor if playing for full synchronization on certain missions, as some full-synchronization parameters are difficult to achieve on the first playthrough of various memories. Combat moves faster, but is substantially easier; death via combat is a self-imposed fate. The feature of synchronization seems to be a tedious attempt of offering replay value. The assassin recruiting mini-game is enjoyable, as the recruits and their names are randomly selected from a pool of presets; the amount of customization available to your recruits was a missed opportunity.

Upon initial release, the multiplayer was exceptional and unique. It rewarded those who took their time dispatching other players with higher scores and more experience points (essential in acquiring a legitimate edge over other players due to locked skills and abilities, which was something of a problem in and of itself), and punished those who killed too quickly and without finesse by yielding less experience.

Brotherhood is a worthy addition to any library, best played after Assassin's Creed II. If you can find people to play its multiplayer with, all the better.",1536614562,1536614562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

―Ezio Auditore da Firenze, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood Launch Trailer.[/b]

It has taken some time for me to complete this one, yet here we are: [i]Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood[/i] is the third game in the series, and the second part that follows Ezio's storyline. There is a reason that this game is a fan favorite, since it contains the allure of the previous game, yet brings in various new features and a truckload to attend and discover. If you have enjoyed the previous game, you'll love this one. Renaissance Italy is yet again here for us to roam in, with one glorious city at our disposal. It seems that the old saying was true all along: all roads lead to Rome.

Well, considering we are already deep into the series at this point, I'll throw my casual ""will contain spoilers"" warning here, just for your attention. Previously in our game, Ezio discovered that he has bitten more than he could chew with the revelation of a message coming to Desmond beyond time. A secret room in Vatican revealed the involvement of parties alien and unseen, parties even godly; and the Animus session got cut short with a Templar raid on our modern assassins' hideout. As templars descended upon Desmond and the crew, they have managed to narrowly escape with their lives and hit the road for the ancestral home of Auditore family: Monteriggioni. Now, setting base in Monteriggioni's underground halls, well below the satellite range of any Abstergo machination, our heroes keep delving into Ezio's memories to get a clue about the fate of the Apple of Eden.

Going back to Ezio's story, he'll soon discover that he has committed a crucial mistake by letting Pope Roderigo Borgia live. He goes back to Monteriggioni with Uncle Mario to discuss the events of Vatican with the rest of his allies, only to wake up to a bloody dawn. As Cesare Borgia arrives to his doorstep with an army, Ezio once again loses all he has: his home, his uncle and the apple- yet not his vengeance and hope for a new dawn. As Ezio escapes the siege barely with his life, he arrives to Roma, the very cradle of Borgia dominance and decides to take the war to Borgia for a change. Here, he will reinstate the Assassin Order by recruiting and training a younger generation of assassins to take the city back from the Borgia.

Exciting, huh? Welcome to [i]Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood[/i] or ""City Building: How I Have Rebuilt Rome Edition"". Rome is a huge city, and it bears countless side quests, collectibles, guild missions, Leonardo mission, unlockables and even some personal memories coming from Ezio's tragic past. I strongly recommend acquiring as many Borgia towers and shops as possible early in the game to establish a steady income. Things to do seemingly won't have an end, and each little thing you do will unlock a new ability, a new piece of equipment or a new narrative to the era itself.

In this game, we will follow Ezio's life from its mid-forties to its mid-fifties. Our beloved assassin doesn't recover from injuries as quickly as he used to, but he is still the daredevil that we know him to be and the benefit of wisdom brings in a new arsenal to him too. Now, he is not alone. As you burn down Borgia towers and assassinate officials, you will recover the city piece by piece; and you will steadily recruit young assassins to do your bidding. You will send them on missions far and wide, for them to get experience, and even let them accompany you in your own missions. By the end, Ezio will be given the title of the Mentor, as the man who saved the Italian Brotherhood.

The setting, so far, is the best in the series. The whole city truly lives, and Ubisoft managed to come close to the notion of an open world in this one. As you travel the streets, you'll witness random interactions between citizens, people attending their daily business; contrary to them roaming certain paths aimlessly, as it was in previous games. Day/Night cycle will enhance the atmosphere and will even present various advantages to you. Various authentic landmarks of Rome are open to visit, and countless wondrous screenshot opportunities will be at hand. Streets are vibrant with the culture of the era, and the nature itself is a beauty to behold, from harbors to lush forests; from valleys to mountain peaks. As a side note, it was a breathtaking moment to take a leap of faith from the top of the great Colosseum.

The historical connotation of the series persists with the return of various figures and the introduction of new ones. Prepare to pay a visit to Leonardo da Vinci again, or cross paths with Copernicus. Machiavelli will do his best to aid us in any manner, and saving Catherine Sforza from a gruesome fate will be a priority. Again, all relevant philosophies, manners and the spirit of the age is narrated within appropriate storylines. The series is a godsend for any history buff. There sure are inconsistencies, but one should keep in mind that the world here is a fictional claim anyhow.

Let's talk gameplay as a closing note: controls are not at their best. Camera angles are hellish, and parkours are a b*tch since you'll never know towards what direction Ezio may decide to leap. Camera angles constantly change during the missions to show you the way that you should follow, but they mostly make you lose balance by changing movement controls too. It takes a great amount of getting used to in this PC port. Some missions expect you to attend things in certain manners for full synchronization, so I bid you good luck on managing a kill strike 10 times in a row with obscure enemy lock-ins. You will have a hard time. Controls still lag, key combinations do not register from time to time and Ezio manages to latch on to every unnecessary surface when he tries to run during missions. Aside that little problem, the game is a small masterpiece.

I hope you will enjoy this one as much as I did. Ezio trilogy is the first time that we watch the passage of a whole era in the series, so it holds a special place for most fans. You witness the time and life of Ezio as a whole: all this growth, both in abilities and personality. I'll be expecting much, much more from the next in the series: [i]Assassin's Creed: Revelations[/i]. Enjoy!

We continue playing as an older, hardened Ezio on his way to becoming a master assassin. His progression is the best part of Brotherhood when it comes to narrative. And while the characters you meet, apart from some villains, aren't as interesting or fleshed out as the second one, many of the older ones play a bigger role here but some of them are left out completely. The story itself is probably the worst in the Ezio trilogy but it's still passable. 

The gameplay is better than ever. The game introduces many new mechanics and fleshes out some from earlier titles. Sadly the camera angles, at which the game puts you during climbing puzzles are still extremely aggravating to deal with on a keyboard. While the new kill streak mechanic in combat dumbs it down significantly, it's better than the repetitive button mashing we got before as combat encounters usually end much faster. We get a new assassin recruitment system, which lets you manage your own recruits, send them on different missions, call them in at any time to help you out and watch them become assassins. Almost every memory has an optional objective now, which makes the game a lot more challenging for those that like to 100% everything. Side activities are much more varied with Templar Agent hunts, Assassination Contracts, new ancient ruins to explore, missions from two of the main guilds, repressed memories and missions involving some of Leonardo's inventions. Unlike ACII, almost every side mission has a story to it, albeit not that substantial for most of them. The optional DLC sequence based around Leonardo is also a huge improvement from the previous ones, which ended up being my least favorite part of ACII. The biggest flaw in Brotherhood's mission design is the insane amount of tailing missions. There is nothing fun about following a slow NPC halfway through the city. Collectibles finally have maps to them and give proper rewards. Borgia Towers are introduced as a part of the now fleshed out renovation system and tie into the recruitment system. Each tower has a captain that you have to assassinate in order to be able to renovate shops in the area.

The modern day part of the game is substantially better than the previous entry with some long gameplay sequences set in places you've explored as Ezio. The great cast of characters return and you get to learn more about them. The Truth puzzles make a return with a more satisfying reward for completing them.

Brotherhood is the first AC game I would call actually beautiful. Instead of different regions, you get to explore one bigger city. Rome is both pristine and falling apart but always detailed in its environment. The soundtrack reuses some of the music from ACII and adds plenty of new tracks that are as good if not better. The game runs great, but I did have a problem with one of the Leonardo missions where the controls of the invention were completely broken if you didn't turn on VSync and played at 60Hz. And even if you did they would still freeze up occasionally.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood focuses on improving and polishing the gameplay, but falls short on the narrative.",1532174634,1532174634,True,1,0,0.50659632682800293,0,True,False,False

Then it becomes rather unpleasant when you enter the missions that ask to perform senseless tasks that you can accomplish easily when you have tried enough times to know the right path to follow - and the right (ouch) twists of fingers to get it done. That's not my idea of a good play, I prefer when the path is quite straightforward but its as hard to complete the hundredth time as it was the first. Otherwise you don't have much replay value and you don't get the precious feeling of having accomplished anything when you arrive at the other end of the journey. And after playing 60+ hours, I still feel lonely as hell in this. I remember having fun listening to the sometimes stupid chat from companions in Fallout 3, New Vegas and Skyrim, that made me feel not so alone in their world and some of them were even somewhat endearing.
So, as I said after 60+ hours, in the middle of the 5th sequence, I have decided to quit playing this game and this is what I had to say. I keep feeling frustrated by the places where it takes me - and those it doesn't when I think it should, and its getting worse as I go forward. I may still hop in and wander around, but I won't try to complete the missions anymore.

And the plot itself very much lends to this feeling more like a side game, not a main entry. Despite that, the gameplay has finally been refined. And the assassin recruitment mechanic is a fan favorite for good reason. 

There's still some issues. Parkour is much better but not quite perfect. Combat was greatly improved in terms of feeling fun, unfortunately it's far too easy. And ironically, despite parkour controlling much better, the combat has some big problems dealing with friendly targets. I've constantly found myself accidentally wailing on friendly characters because for some reason Ezio prioritized them. I've even been hit by random mercenaries I hired, it's like the AI even struggles to deal with the lockon system.

The soundtrack is absolutely phenominal, though it could have used a bit more variety, a bit too much repetition for my taste.

The cutscenes are finally not total garbage, but there's still some bad sound design. Voice acting overall is a step up from AC2. Dialogue is mostly better, though again lots of awkward lines nd Desmond is incredibly annoying. 

Probably one of my favorite parts of the game is how it takes place in one city. Rome feels really fleshed out and fun to explore. It's not overwhelming like 2 where you'd spend hours collecting everything in one city only to see 4 other huge cities to explore right after. This game allows you to get more familiar with your setting which is a huge plus.

Overall a very solid title. I'm a bit divided on suggesting it as an entry point though.

It's still the same game, it's a look-at-our-graphics-engine 3rd person stealth/combat/platform game. It looks smoother and it adds new mechanics. You only have one city this time, but you have to fight to take over each region in the city (Think Saint's Row or that kind of thing). There's a lot more gold to be gained and a lot more to spend your gold on, but at some point pretty early you're only making gold in order to make gold without any target purpose.

You also become the head of the assassins now, so you become even more badass than in the second as you don't even need to bother killing enemies. You have staff now to kill the bad guys in the game for you. 

Sound: 5/10. Voice acting is still top notch. However, this is one of a few games where I found myself getting annoyed at how poor the music was. Most of the tunes were just a loud bass line with a voice or a single instrument humming over it. Like Muzak but without the excitement.

Graphics: 9/10. Still gorgeous. Want to climb the colloseum? Of course you do.
 
Story: 6/10. The end of AC2 gave the impression that they were already losing the thread, and it's pretty visible in this. You spend ages fighting the main villain and killing all his henchmen even though there's no clear indication as to why you feel the need to do so. And the ending is laaaaaaame. Urgh.

Fun: 8/10. The quests are plentiful and varied. There's enough to do in the game. And still huge buildings to scale. Yes, I'll climb the colloseum again. I own it now, so I'm allowed to, OK?

Penalties: -6/-10. Ubisoft must UCantPlay. I don't know why. And I don't know why I have to wait for it to start the game I bought over Steam. Their inability to work together should not be my problem. And the consolitis from the earlier game is still there. I don't think they've even been to the doctor since the first game. You still randomly attack walls if the camera decides to flip on you, not to mention making you jump off high ledges.
 
Oh, and it installs some anti-cheat malware. Yes, it's malware. Anti-cheat software is something that starts when the game starts and ends when the game ends. This thing calls itself a service and starts when the computer boots up, so it's lying in the background eating CPU cycles even when you're not playing the game. Yeah, no thanks.

I bought the first 3 games together. 1 was a chore. 2 was fine, 3 was more of the same. I think I could have stopped after the second, to be honest. The third one adds a number of things, but none that I really missed. I think my adventures with Assassin's Creed will stop here.

The story is good and the prologue was great. It did a great job setting up the story and introducing the main villain, Cesare Borgia. It was also a smart way to make Ezio start with no overpowered equipment from the last game (Altair's Armor).

One other thing remarkable about the story is the ending, that last fight scene of Cesare and Ezio was great and very rewarding. The scene afterwards was just epic.

The characters were well-written too. Cesare was a great villain in my opinion and you could really feel his hunger for power as he would do anything to get it. And Ezio was good enough in Assassin's Creed II and here he is just as good but more mature and wise. His character develops well, too.

The downsides are that even though there are some new mechanics introduced and some controls were changed, the game felt not so different from Assassin's Creed II. The game started getting repetitive. One other problem is some of the missions were boring, but it wasn't much of a deal. There also weren't many Da Vinci upgrades to buy but that's fine.

Still, this game is one of the best in the franchise and it is well-worth your time. You should definetely play this game if you liked the previous one.",1525804930,1529446341,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Basic info on equipment: HP Pavilion dv6-6123cl entertainment notebook. Processor AMD A6-3400M APU w/Radeon HD Graphics 1.40 GHz. Installed RAM of 6 GB. 64-Bit Windows 10 OS. Wired external mouse and keyboard. No additional equipment used or upgrades made to computer.

Gameplay and Controls 6/10:  Same as the last game, which actually was a bonus for me, considering how long it took me to get used to the controls in the first place. :p The addition of the hotkey to call on other assassin's was nice, but honestly, I hardly ever used it unless it was required by the goals of the quest I was completing or I was starting to get overwhelmed by the enemies I was fighting and needed backup. Otherwise, my fellow assassin brothers kind of stayed unused. I did like how you could send them on quests to gain more skills and liberate other areas. That I actually found very useful, especially since it improved their combat ability and made them more helpful when you did end up calling on them. I also appreciated how they retained the banking and investment system from the previous game and incorporated it more into the liberation of Rome from the influence of the Templars.

Graphics 9/10:  I'm not sure why, but I actually felt that the graphics were a tiny step down from the previous game. The overall feel of the world was still just as rich, and it made exploring Rome incredibly fun and rewarding, but the characters and animations just seemed...off. Maybe it was a little more ""cookie cutter"" in terms of the extraneous characters? Again, I'm not entirely sure why, and I'd probably have to play AC II and Brotherhood a little bit again to pinpoint exactly what I found to be different. Either way, the graphics were still quite good, as with all of the AC games, and it really wasn't big enough of a difference to change my experience of the game.

Storyline 7/10:  The storyline was still enjoyable, but again, not quite as good as that within AC II. I think the part I liked the most was the history behind the fictional story, which made the whole thing much more immersive. Even with that, however, this game felt much less like one cohesive story and much more like a barely strung together main story supported by numerous side quests and adventures. Whereas playing AC II was like playing through a James Michener novel, with all the rich detail and background to accompany and enhance it, this felt more like reading a short story that had lots of side stories you could read in association with it. That's possibly due to the fact that, whereas AC II covers around thirty years of history, this game only covers a few years. Either way, the story was not as well constructed, but it wasn't terrible either. It was just a little above average. I also played through The Da Vinci Disappearance DLC, and it was like an interesting short story. Even though the Copernicus Conspiracy DLC was supposedly released for PC, I've not been able to find it on my game menus or in the Ubisoft menus, so I can't speak to how good of a story that particular software addition provides.
*EDIT:  I played through the entire game again recently after having installed it on my new hard drive. The Copernicus Conspiracy did show up and I was able to play it. Similar to the Da Vinci Disappearance, it was more like a short story tangentially related to the main story as opposed to anything really important. It was a fun diversion, but not necessarily something I'd seek out playing again.

Characters 7/10:  Well, Da Vinci is still great, for the little that we see of him. And of course, Ezio is his usual charismatic self, even if he's older and maybe a little grimmer than in AC II. Otherwise, the characters lacked the same depth and variety that they had in AC II. Even the villains, with the exception of Lucrezia Borgia, I found to be very cliche. All of the characters were still somewhat believable, but I didn't feel like leaping through the screen to interact with them like I did in the previous game.
*EDIT: Copernicus actually proved to be a somewhat interesting character, even if they fictionalized his association to a certain power-hungry group within the game and the fact that his scientific theories were cause for him nearly being killed. You sadly don't see very much of him, as his main parts in the quests involving the DLC are at the beginning and end.

Overall Rating 8/10:  This game is a solid addition to the AC franchise. It's certainly not as strong, beautiful, nor coherent as AC II, but it's still an enjoyable game to play for the most part, and I didn't feel like I was wasting my time, even if I was just wandering around the beautiful city of Rome.

Along with that you will be recruiting Assassin's along the way. They turned rescuing civilians into the way you recruit. You can then send them off into missions to provide you with loot, or you can keep some active and call for them when you need them.

     This is my first Assassin's Creed game, and I quite enjoyed it. Jumping from roof to roof to beam was fun. The story was great and ended on a note which is tempting to buy the next in the storyline to find out what happens. I enjoyed the fact that you can customize Ezio slightly, and Shaun was a great comic relief with his cinical sarcasm. The graphics and AI were pretty good as well. The guards would not be able to see you if you were behind them and the civilians would react if you did something to them or in front of them (funniest being the ones carrying boxes). 

     However, the one thing that might prevent me from replaying the full story would be the controls. Even after changing the keybindings to something more familiar and comfortable, they still suck. Sometimes the camera angle would be fixed, preventing you from seeing where you need to jump or where you are going. The character might not even go in the direction of the camera but instead jump off to God knows where and you'd have to wait for him to physically turn in the direction you are looking before you can go in that direction. There is no separate button for jumping/climbing and sprinting so if you wanted to just run through the streets but hit a wall... up you go!

Overall  8.5/10
This game is an improvement of the original Ezio game in many ways. There is more stuff to do after the story is finished, missions can be replayed to get 100% sync, and there are many faction missions. One of my favourite questlines was when Ezio went back in time and we saw his relationship with a girl called Christina evolve over time. It felt very nostalgic even though I only played AC2 about a week before. However, the main story isn't as insteresting this time. Something about some guy called Cesare Borgia, you spend the game working your way up the hitlist of enemies until you finally kill the main target. Still fun, but not as compelling as the coming of age story of the first game. Rome an amazing setting, and I especially loved the colluseum and other ancient monuments.",1527270417,1528411587,True,3,0,0.564245820045471191,0,True,False,False

Story: 7/10
Starts out amazing and goes downhill soon after act 1 ends.  This game does do a better job then its predecessors at making the present day story engaging though.  Main issue is just pacing.  All the AC games suffer from this.  Its hard to tell a story when people are running around doing side quests.  With that said even if you only do the main storyline it still goes downhill due to many quests that seem like busy work to get to actually important story sections.

Characters 8/10
Ezio and Claudia remain amazing.  Leonardo Da-Vinci is also as hilarious as ever.  Desmond got way better (along with everyone else in the present day cast).  Unfortunately those are the only characters who actually stand out to me.  Everyone else felt kind of bland (besides the main antagonist who's name I forget...).  

Gameplay 9/10
Vastly imroved from AC2.  Combat and exploration flows way better now.

Music:  8/10
Soundtrack from AC2 is good.  Everything else is alright

The Gameplay is good (although its exactly the same as all the other assassin's creed games), and the action is full.
However, the entire game takes place in rome (which at first is pretty cool), so, although the map is large, you very quickly get bored of it. Another problem is the story- it's pretty uninteresting. The whole story is kind of a waste of time, as all that happens is the apple of eden is stolen, and you have to get it back. You also have a side-quest where you have to collect keys from tombs to get the armour of Romulus, which is fun, but is pretty much exactly the same as getting Altairs armour in number two, so you definitely can't say that this game is creative. The main problem with this game, is that after about fifteen hours of playing it, you get fed up of doing the same thing over and over, so you stop playing the game, depite the story not being finished. That happens to me with all the assassin's creed games though.

Now, what I am about to write next can be considered >>>>SPOILER<<<<, but just hear me out, I am not spoiling the story, or the characters per se, just about the game (how it was designed) itself, which I wish were told in the reviews, and therefore, players can enjoy this game even more.

At the beginning, everything was great, until the Sequence 8 starts, everything went from ""Awesome, I love this game!!"" to ""What just happened?! What am I doing here?!"". Ubisoft completely hit pedal and rushed the ending to a point where you feel the game has jumped from one timeline to a completely different timeline, with no hints, no warnings, no explanation of what is happening. 

Usually when one sequence ends, we were given some time to let all that we learned/gained/experience in the sequence sink in, even give some time to complete some side missions (ESPECIALLY the side missions). And this (for me at least) is very important, it lets me enjoy the game to the fullest. But AC Brotherhood did not give me this option at the end, it just forced me to go straight to the ending without proper game experience and accomplishments. By the time I finished the Sequence 8 and 9 (which is all of them there is left to play as EzIo), I felt like it is not worth to continue the playing, because, you know, it is done!

So my advice to anyone new playing AC Brotherhood is >>>>> DON'T START SEQUENCE 8 UNTIL YOU ARE DONE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE!!! Hope this helps new players enjoy the game more!

There is a noticeable increase in graphics quality on the PC, especially with character models, and controllers work much better out of the box (without the need for extra controller programs like the first 2 games). 

Rome is a very large area with even more to do than the past 2 games including a lot more purchasing/upgrading of shops, side and extra missions, and the recruitment and leveling up of other assassin's. The recruit attack function was a fantastic addition to the game and made it so much fun to just run around and send your assassin's to kill guards around you, I'm hoping it's expanded on and improved in future games. The addition of the crossbow was also a great new addition to this third game in the series. Overall all of these additions, including poison darts, really helped to add a lot more silent kill options, making you feel much more of a silent assassin than the previous 2 games did.

The story, while I thought good, didn't seem to have a much scope and depth as the first 2 games, making this feel story-wise like more of an expansion to the second game. It seemed like there was a shorter number of main quests and really easy to burn through the main quests and finish the game without realizing how far along you are. It is all the side content that pads out the game to a much larger completion time then the previous games and I found myself just having fun in the world more then I have up to this point in the series.

This takes everything that is great about Assassin’s Creed 2, gives you lots more of the same and makes some little improvements to it to make it even better.

[b]Full Review[/b]
After hitting on a winning formula in Assassin’s Creed 2 this game picks up where that game left off with a great continuation of the story.

Gameplay wise they have kept things predominantly the same but they have made numerous minor tweaks here and there. The key one is the improvement to the combat, now when you kill an opponent you can just mash X and keep executing opponents. This speeds up the combat when previously you could get bogged down waiting for an opportunity to counter attack. The new addition of the crossbow is excellent, it is a lot more effective and fun than throwing knives.

The graphics have been slightly improved which crucially means Lucy now looks human rather than falling into the creepy uncanny valley.

Having enjoyed the villa restoration in 2 I was glad to find this has now been expanded to restoring things across the whole map. This kind of collect all the things marked on the map in a free roaming environment gameplay is like crack to me. At the start of the game I found my self spending hours carrying out urban renewal before remembering that this game is actually about stabbing people.

Another improvement is that it is now one big map and you can ride horses anywhere so getting around is much nicer. You can even summon a horse at any time so you never get stuck in the middle of nowhere. The addition of a parachute also helps getting around.

A new feature is the addition of assassin minions you can train up to help you and send on missions.  This is a great new piece of gameplay where you can suddenly send in waves of dudes to help you out in a fight.

One nice minor improvement is you can mark the glyph locations on the map to help hunt those down.

However not everything is an improvement. My biggest annoyance is that it marks things on the map even when that area of the map is not available. This means you never know which things you can actually collect and each time you complete a level you have to go and check all the areas to find which are actually now accessible.

Another misstep is the inclusion of items when looting. These can be sold for different prices at different shops. So at the start of game you sell all of these for the best prices but then you find out you need to keep these to unlock extra items of equipment so then you start hoarding them and by the time you have completed all the shop quests you have so much money selling them is pointless.

The last game had a nice extra video when you collected all the glyphs. I don’t want to spoil anything but this has an underwhelming conclusion when you collect all the glyphs and completed the incomprehensible puzzles which I can’t help but feel a little short changed by.

One addition which I am on the fence about is the full sync rating. This means that each mission has a secondary objective necessary to get full sync. Sometimes this is fun and gets you to carry out the mission in a ways you might not have done otherwise but other times it is plain annoying. Getting enough synchronisation unlocks extra missions. I was worried that this would mean there would be some missions I’d never unlock but you only need to get 75% synchronisation to unlock all of them so that’s not too bad. Also if you get 100% on a sequence you unlock a cheat but the game does not tell you about this I only found out after I had finished the entire game and was checking online to see if there was anything I’d missed. Also annoyingly these cheats can only be used when replaying a mission.

Another random addition is that you can leave the simulation and see that the four heroes when locked in basement cut off from the world just spent their entire time emailing each other.

There are 2 purchasing options. I got the digital deluxe version as I wanted to get all the expansions. However looking at the store page more closely it appears most of the stuff is included in the standard version. Given I’ve no interest in the multiplayer the only part of the deluxe version I played was the 2 extra maps and I’m not convinced the extra £4 was worth it for about 30min extra gameplay even if those levels are fun. But whichever version you go for this game is very much worth getting and is my favourite in the series so far.",1522696667,1522696667,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ezio has decided to continue his fight in a magnificent setting: medieval Rome. The city design and graphics cannot be held up to today's standards, of coursse, it is far too simplistic and poorly laid-out. For example, you cannot climb the rocks of the seven hills of Rome, you have to take the long way around instead, and it quickly becomes annoying. The downtown Rome is lovely, but as soon as you venture outside, it is just empty plain fields and a few roads. The Roman ruins are just standing in the middle of those fields wierdly and unnaturallly. However,- and this is important to mention - the game is quite old, and our expectations have grown. So I'm giving the game design the respect it deserves despite the minor drawbacks.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
And now to the best part. The mechanics of recruiting assassins and assigning tasks to them are perfect. It just feels right and exciting. Exploring the ruins on different missions are great, too, adding some exciting arcade mechanics to the game. The collectibles, side-missions, unlockable weapons and upgrades, investing in shops, all of these are done well.

[h1]Storyline[/h1]
The storyline is interesting and exciting, even if exaggerated a little. The fighting suffers from weak combat mechanics, though; but again, let us remember that the game is not exactly recent, and was fine back in the day. Besides, I cannot say that other AC series games have better mechanics anyway. You cannot expect the Batman or Mordor type of immersive fighting.

Unlike the previous game, this one doesn't have many locations, instead it's set in Rome which is for some reason locked up. Almost all the shops are locked unless you decide to renovate them, they will stay locked. You can't explore the whole map without progressing in the main story-line.

The story is not that good but not bad either. Plots are quite predictable (not talking about present time). This is the first game in the series to introduce recruitment of other Assassins - creating the Brotherhood.

Combat is too easy and there's still no difficulty settings available.

Graphics are great for its time and Rome's atmosphere is just amazing.

Soundtrack is mind blowing, there's always that perfect sound for every situation.

This game's two rewards are tied to Ubisoft's Facebook game Assassin's Creed: Project Legacy which is no longer available, making it impossible to get the rewards.

Taking over different parts of Rome using different strategy feels nice but again, this game is so easy - you can just kill all of your enemies without breaking a sweat.

Overall it's a nice game, can't say it's open-world because of the fact that most of the map stays locked if you don't progress in the main story-line.

The story takes place after the event of AC 2 and continue the story of Ezio fighting against the Templar, but u dont really need to play through AC 2 to understand what the game is talking about since it has very good story discription and writing.

As such, I was pleasantly surprised by how entertained I have been by its immediate sequel, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. While Brotherhood is technically a standalone game, it is effectively an expansion to AC 2. Also, because the story picks up immediately where AC 2 left off, it is best played immediately after AC 2. Whereas the story of AC 2 took place in Florence, Venice, and three other minor towns, Brotherhood takes place, almost exclusively, in Rome. During the early part of the 16th century, our protagonist, Ezio Auditore has come to Rome to settle debts with the Borgias and their Templar allies.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Brotherhood does not introduce many, if any, new gameplay mechanics. It seems like the same game engine was used for Brotherhood as for AC 2. But missions and side quests are more elaborate in design. The setting of Rome, even more grand than Florence and Venice, unfolds through completion of objectives and story missions. Although the side quests are still side quests in nature, such as simple assassinations, races, exploration, etc., they also include voiced dialogue with NPCs or in-game cinematics, so clearly a lot of effort was applied to all aspects of the game. Brotherhood also improves on AC 2 in subtle ways; for example, a nice quality of life improvement is that there are hints or markers in-game for most collectibles, whereas in AC 2 you had to hunt down feathers that were not marked on the map (often having to resort to help from the internet to hunt them down -  I, for one, did not bother with all the feathers in AC 2).

Some missions can be quite challenging, particularly if one aims to go for 100% synchronization: basically you can complete a mission and gain at least 50% synchronization, but for 100%, you have to complete the mission under some condition (e.g. not be detected, kill only main target, under three minutes, do not lose health, etc.). The latter can occasionally be quite challenging, although doable even for a casual player (such as myself); the 100% synchronization is also completely optional, if just looking to complete the storyline. 

[b]Characters/Customization[/b]
By the time Ezio Auditore reaches Rome, he is a seasoned assassin, surrounded by familiar allies from AC 2.  Although he still upgrades his gear throughout the game, he himself does not develop at all. The ""character"" that grows the most throughout the game is clearly the city of Rome, as Ezio increases his sphere of influence throughout the city while diminishing the influence of the ruling Borgias. 

[b]Story/Atmosphere[/b]
The story of Brotherhood is a direct continuation of AC 2. After the triumphs of AC 2, the Assassins suffer a setback, courtesy of the Borgias, and Ezio makes his way to start a campaign of vengeance. Rome is an even more ""open world"" setting than Florence or Venice, although some areas are still locked behind progression objectives. The main story of Brotherhood is, in my opinion, more interesting than the origin story and tale of vengeance from AC 2.  The side missions and DLC content also have minor storylines that work well within the context of Brotherhood.

[b]Graphics/Sound[/b]
Brotherhood looks and feels very much as AC 2, although I think additional character models and graphics were added for the sequel. For its time, the graphics, sound, and music are great.  I did not encounter any technical issues, such as bugs, nor did I have to apply any mods to get more out of the game.

[b]Replay Value:[/b] None, assuming one completes all the side content. 

[b]Overall Score:[/b] 9/10

Unlike the 2 games before it, AC:B is a truly open world that isn't split into lots of smaller areas like AC1&2 were. This makes the city feel more seamless and open, as it means no waiting to visit different areas.

The first thing I noticed when I started playing AC:B was just how much more in depth the world is compared to the games before it. The detail in the environments is better than ever, along with a huge amount of different NPCs and enemies. The graphics are really impressive too and are a great improvement over AC2.

In my opinion, the combat in this game is the best so far. You can now break an enemy's defence by kicking them in the legs, as well as performing some really cool execution moves. You can also recruit new assassins to join you, which can be really helpful if you're losing a fight.

As for downsides, I'd say that Rome is not as friendly for free-running as AC2 was. There are lots of very open areas with not a lot things to climb, which means you just have to run across flat fields which can be a little tedious and boring. I was also surprised at how short the game was too. Though it wasn't too short (it took me about 10 hours to complete the story), it was shorter than AC2 and it felt like they tried to rush the ending to get started on the next game. I suppose this can be forgiven considering the next game continues the story on from this one, but it was a little surprising at how quickly the I reached the end.

Unfortunately like AC2, this game also suffers from poor optimisation. I am on a completely fresh install of windows, so I am pretty sure nothing else is conflicting with the game. It doesn't make the game unplayable by any means, but it can get a little distracting every now and then.

I'd reccomend you at least play AC2 before playing this, as without it not a lot will make sense to you. Though I did enjoy this game, I would say that AC2 is slightly better overall, though this game does improve in some areas compared to AC2.

Brotherhood picks up directly from the end of ACII and continues the story seamlessly. Overall, I preferred Brotherhood to II. Due to it being a continuation of the previous story, Brotherhood has much more consistent pacing, in both story and gameplay. While II had a much better arc for Ezio’s development, Brotherhood uses Ezio for a much more refined series of Assassinations, and focusses more on developing side-characters. Brotherhood has less story assassinations than ACII, but each has much more buildup and feels much more satisfying to pull off. Unlike ACII, Brotherhood is limited almost exclusively to Rome, but Rome itself is a sprawling mix of urban, suburban, and rural all within the same walls, and the ability to ride a horse anywhere in the city is wholly welcome. Side-missions have their own storylines making them feel more impactful, even when they didn't directly tie into the main storyline. The expanded influence of ‘sync’ and the extra requirements for sync was a mostly positive addition, through some particular requirements were a pain, and some were realistically impossible to have achieved on the first try, (completing a series of miniature mazes under a strict time limit with very little room for error). Overall, if you liked ACII, you’ll like Brotherhood as well, and you’ll feel perfectly at home jumping in, (though I would recommend against playing without having played Assassin’s Creed II).",1520225703,1520225703,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

I guess, for me, there was more ""busy stuff"" that was really not much fun and had nothing to add to the story line.

The story continues after Assassin's Creed II - which I missed before cuz I went right to Assassin's Creed III. So I missed quite a lot of story and now I am replaying it to understand it. 

Gameplay is pretty much the same as in Assassin's Creed II. Graphics are same only few new items added to the game - such as crossbow and investing and building up store systems to earn some cash. I didn't really invest time in building the city up because it didn't add much to the actual story. Finished game without it very easily. 

If playing the game for story - I recommend it. But play previous ones first to understand what is going on.

Why? You will definitely fall onto the right track of their story line, see how far they have come (every transactional from their graphics designs to a whole new control experience) and the most obvious it's k.i.c.k.a.s.s.a.s.s.i.n. 

Reasons to get the game? Pros
+ Story is 8.5/10 (no spoilers)
+ Game looks amazing (everything, for its time)
+ Gameplay's always fresh and fun
+ Real-life historical figures
+ Missions are top-notch

Cons
- IF you're planning on trying to get 100% synchronize on all mission, you might struggle a bit. Still manageable.
- Not the best camera angle
- Unlike consoles, PC port brings tons of glitches and bugs (but this is pretty minor)

Interested or planning to get back right on track after skipping some installments? You won't regret getting this one for sures! Cheers

+Parkour
+Beautiful scenery
+Plenty of extra content

Good things compared to the previous game:
+Ability to replay missions without needing to start over.
+Each mission now has some bonus objective for those looking for an extra challenge. It does make some missions more interesting.
+Addition of killstreaks that allow you to instakill people if you manage to maintain your streak. Quite fun when you get surrounded by tons of guards from all sides.
+Cristina's story
+Ability to hotkey the weapons/items you use the most.
+The pistol targets faster, making it actually useful.
+Getting to ride a horse in town and battling on horseback was a nice addition.
+It's nice to be able to summon assassin backup mid-battle.
+Eagle Vision would mark any collectibles on the map. Nice when you're in the middle of a mission and don't want to take a detour. And you can buy a map if you don't want to spend too much time on hunting down the hundred flags.
+Melee weapons are now paired with ranged weapons.
+Crossbow and poison darts added some tactical options for some form of stealth in the game. Especially useful in memories where you had to avoid detection.
+Addition of lifts as a quick way to get on a roof.
+Some things to do in the present day as well, albeit not too much.

Some things I didn't like:
-uPlay
-The story is shorter and interested me less than the previous game
-The numerous Borgia towers you had to destroy to unlock shops in the city were more of a repetitive nuisance than an interesting activity. Each tower was basically the same thing - find a specific character, kill him, and climb a tower to light it. Once or twice is fine, but twelve was a bit much. Especially since most of the viewpoints in this game were those very towers.
-You can select your fast travel destination through the map on the fast travel window. Instead, you have to go through a list of place names until the location you want to travel to lights up. Kinda unnecessarily annoying.
-No ability to replay from checkpoint. If you screw up with the optional objective for a mission, you have to restart the entire thing from scratch. It may not be a problem for most missions, but some require going through some annoying cinematics and other time wasting segments.
-Purchasing landmarks. I'm honestly not sure what point that serves. The pay from landmarks is very negligible (especially compared to how much you invest in them) and it doesn't change anything about the landmark. I'd understand if the payment would restore the landmark to some extent or something, but as it is, it's just something you can dump your extra money on.
-The store investment. I'd understand if you could invest as much money as you liked in as many stores as you wanted, but you can only invest in one store at a time (until you receive income from the stores you renovated) and could only invest a designated amount of money. So, not much you can do with it.
-You can loot some random stuff from bodies and chests, but there's nothing really you can do with the stuff, other than completing a couple of shop quests or just selling the stuff off. Kind of an underused system.

To be honest, while Brotherhood was a nice game, I didn't feel as into it as ACII. I'd still recommend playing it, but I'm not sure if I'd personally be ineterested in replaying it one day.",1514668252,1515362607,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

honestly i can't say anything but repetitive and repetitive.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood lacks in the mission area, it needs to be more open.
In many cases i failed the mission because i stepped over the mission space limit which is very frustrating.
Missions are basically the same with little variations, of course there are the flying missions, cannons, tanks etc. 
but they only come once and you are back in the same *tail, climb, don't get caught, maybe kill some guards, assassinate and escape* Then you can explore the open world which is repetitive too, buy stores and weapons, invest, climb to tower and get the area unlocked from the mist and collect collectibles.

And even in the flying, tank, etc missions i was frustrated because they were riddled with bugs. I couldn't control my flying and i tried fixing it for an hour. Then found out that the problem was because of my G-Sync monitor, turned the G-Sync and it worked.

One thing i found to be fun is to recruit assassins, put them on contracts, level them up and call them for help.
But then i realized that even that is just kinda waste of time. You just do the contracts for the money, then you just buy more stores, more contracts, more stores etc. 

Maybe buy some new weapons which doesn't feel to impact the game very much.

Combat is made very easy because of the counter attack, so that's that. Cool first, but just boring after couple hours.

Characters are just plain boring and have not much characteristics, the only character which i found to be funny is Bartolomeo d'Alviano. Italian accent makes you skip the cutscenes in the long run.

Technical first - starting with the longstanding issues. When I bought the game it locked me out of AC2 which would fail at launching uplay - an issue Ubi support swore blind wasn't caused by Uplay DRM. I eventually gave up contacting them after around 4 months or so as it started to seem more like busywork rather than actually resolving the issue. Eventually a patch came out after a few years which magically (and silently) resolved the issue.

I have always had to launch the game multiple times so the game will accept keyboard input.

Multiplayer never really worked on OSX - and it seems Ubisoft decided it wasn't worth the hassle of fixing  hence the large notice saying MP isn't supported on mac.

The combination of the above led me to never buy any Ubisoft game since.

Newer issues (which I expect will get no fixes from the devs due to the game's age and lack of interest in the platform) - the uplay app has an opaque white overlay, essentially obscuring the single means of launching the game. 

It's still functional - you just have to memorise the button positions as the overlay flickers to life or launch the game from MP which bypasses Uplay altogether. This latter is actually faster than going through Uplay - which underlines how important tethering the game to Uplay actually is for user experience.

Finally on OSX 10.13.1 the game freezes for reasons I've yet to figure out. So if you are contemplating buying the game for the first time - be aware you may only get to play it in bursts of 5-10 minutes.



As to gameplay, at its best its enormously fun. While combat is kind of reliant on block and counter and the kill streaks have always given me a Dance Dance Revolution meets QTE vibe which I never quite liked, there is some variety there if you look for it. 

My niggles with the gameplay though: 

With hindsight taking the route of collectables/feathers/flags to pad any claims of ""XX hours of playtime"" trend started with AC but I gather it is a staple of Ubisoft open world games. The biggest AC2 B peeve however the control schemes are messed around to make things more difficult in certain, non skippable, timer critical, missions. This is something that gets hammered into budding game devs as a major no-no - don't spend time encouraging and rewarding players for using your control system, then whip the rug out from under them unless you really want to piss them off. This isn't a ""git gud"" issue, I completed the missions but I despised and resented the game for punishing me for being good at the game's, up to then, control system.",1514008685,1514084776,False,5,0,0.432875841856002808,0,True,False,False

[b]DISCLAIMER: THIS REVIEW DOES NOT EVALUATE MULTIPLAYER MODE DUE TO LOW PLAYER POPULATION.[/b]

[h1]Story[/h1]
Featuring a dual narrative, Brotherhood follows the story of Ezio Auditore in 16th century Rome.  Ezio is a veteran Assassin, a secretive order of highly trained killers who have taken up the mantle of safeguarding the free will of humanity.  They oppose the Templars, another secretive faction who dig their claws deep into the religious and governmental institutions of society; trying to impose order on what they view to be lost people prone to pain and suffering.  Yet graver threats loom on the horizon as well.  A recording from Minerva, a god-like woman resembling the stories of old, claims that she and her people ruled over humanity in an age so ancient that even time has forgotten them.  She warns that in that era, the sun erupted and decimated almost all life on the planet; humans and her own kind alike, and that it would happen again.  She eerily conveys this warning not to 16th century Ezio, but to Desmond Miles through Ezio; a 21st century Assassin reliving his ancestor Ezio's memories with the help of a machine known as an Animus.  Desmond is searching through Ezio's time in Rome during his conflict with the Borgia family for control of the city.  At some point, Ezio acquired and then hid an Apple of Eden, a piece of technology from Minvera's time, and Desmond needs it to ward off the coming eruption.
Pitted against the brutal but cunning Cesare Borgia and his grip on Rome, Ezio must bring together his fellow Assassins and recruit new members to grow his operation.  The narrative starts off incredibly strong, but becomes heavily unfocused for the greater middle of it as Ezio runs what are essentially errands to earn the favor of his companions.  Several aggravating run-ins with what should have ended with Cesare's assassination but don't; only worsen these problems, and the ending on Ezio's side of things wraps up in a shotgun blast of fast fowards and confusion.  Desmond's ending, on the other hand, feels very deserved and was a genuinely magical moment even if it slapped me with a cliff-hanger.
Don't touch the corrupted Da Vinci memory until after completing Sequence 07.  It's completely out of order with the the rest of the story and spoils it.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Brotherhood is a third person action adventure with a unqiue free-running mechanic that allows Ezio and Desmond to scale walls, leap rooftops, dive into haystacks, and more.  Combat with swords, hammers, and other weapons is sometimes clumsy and far, far too easy.  Succesfully executing or counter-killing an opponent allows Ezio to move from target to target and instantly kill each, one at time.  Enemies can attack in an attempt to interrupt this chain, but only ever do so one at a time and can themselves be folded into the chain by countering.  Underneath all of the stabbing and climbing is a pseudo-management game.  Rome has been left in disrepair by the Borgia's neglect and excess.  Ezio can use money he collects to renovate shops, faction buildings, transportation, and even cultural landmarks.  These renovations each feed small amounts of coin into his bank account every so often.  The more you repair; the more interest you earn on top of other benefits.  The open world of Roma is massive, spanning all the way from the papal residence of the Vatican to the rolling Roman countryside with the Tiber river and central city in between.  Flashbacks and special missions also take you outside of Rome to Florence, Venice, and more.  A horse can be summoned anywhere at any time for faster transport, and renovated sewer tunnels can be used for instant travel.  Players also manage the Brotherhood by recruiting candidates and sending them on missions across the Mediterranean to bring back money and other items as they learn the ropes along the way.  This management doesn't add up to much more than a bit of a distraction, and while being able to call on your Assassins to wipe out the enemies around you in a fight is very cool; it only makes the easy combat even easier.  Hundreds of collectible flags, treasure chests, and feathers dot the landscape and offer their own rewards.  Your willingness to track them down will depend on your tolerance for video games turning into busy work.

Roma is absolutely gorgeous to behold.  The city extends off into the horizon with standout structures like the legendary Collosseum tower above the bustling streets.  Rocky cliffs and ancient ruins dot the lush fields in the surrounding.  16th century Italian artwork and architecture blends with original Roman design to make for a unique setting.  The music ranges from excellent tracks I'll be taking with me on the go to more oppressive but perfectly fitting ambient synths, strings, and vocals to set the mood.  Main character design is in top form and although polygons often stand out, textures are relatively distinct and readable.  The actors deserve credit as well.  Cesare Borgia in particular is brought to life with extreme aggresion, conceit, and dominance.  Pop-in and LOD swap outs can often be an issue, but have been cleverly masked by either the simple rolling hills in the distance or the thick crowds blocking your view.  You'll certainly notice it, but often times it'll slip right past you as well.  Over all, the game is very well constructed.",1510561796,1513950689,True,2,0,0.535027921199798584,4,True,False,False

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the sequel to the highly successful 2009 release, Assassin's Creed II. Released in 2011, two years after its predecessor, players once again take on the role of a romantic, yet badass, Italian assassin from the Renaissance era known as Ezio Auditore da Firenze. For those who have never played a game from this franchise, there's absolutely no reason to start on this installment; Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood, and Revelations are a trilogy that are best played in their original chronological order. That being said, whether you liked or disliked the prior two installments, many elements of the franchise have changed, for the better, with Brotherhood, and gamers who may have disliked the repetitve nature of the last two releases would be well advised to give this title a shot.

When we last left Ezio, he had finished conquering some beautiful, well-known cities in Italy such as Venice and Florence, all the while abolishing the Templar scourge that laid within each one. In the end, his uncle Mario officially inducted him into the Assassin order, and he was last seen capturing the ever elusive Apple of Eden in a highly technologically advanced underground chamber. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood picks up right where the last title ended, and continues onward from there. After a terrible and somewhat unexpected attack on his homestead, Ezio and his family flee from the now ruined Villa Audatorie. With his sister Claudia and mother Maria, Ezio settles in Roma (Rome), where he has the vast city at his disposal, and many exploration opportunities lay in wait; as do the Borgia, the enemy army of this title.

While the last two franchise installments were seen as fairly repetitive, though to a lesser extent with the second game, Brotherhood is anything but repetitous. It's jam-packed with content, though all of it is hurled at the player from nearly the start of the game. If one doesn't feel like tackling the 9 sequence story, there are a multitude of other events to take on; memories of Ezio's first love, Cristina, Borgia towers to scale and burn down, thief missions, assassination contracts, courtesian tasks, Leonardo sequences, and so very much more. Not to mention the plethora of chests, feathers, and Borgia flags that need to be collected. While the main story lasts about 13-15 hours, players can expect a solid 30-50 if they choose to complete everything; there is absolutely no lack of content here.

There are also a number of series changes and franchise firsts in Brotherhood. This is the first Assassin's Creed title to introduce challenges, though they are all faction-themed for the mercenaries, theives, and courtesans. It's also the first to include 100% Synch objectives, where one must attempt to meet the extra criteria per mission to achieve a complete synchronization with Ezio. More virgin elements include the ability to replay any mission, main or not, as well as the Assassin's Guild; a somewhat mini-game where Ezio can send his army of assassins out into the field to level them up with experience points, as well as gain gold and items. Speaking of which, yes, Brotherhood is the debut of actual items that are used to complete shop quests. There are also fast travel points now, and Ezio can spend his hard-earned money rebuilding Roma by reconstructing shops, banks, stables, and purchasing historical landmarks.

Roma is the only map players will be traversing for the entirety of their game time, and while that may sound boring, rest assured that it is not. Roma in and of itself is massive, especially when taking in to account everything that there is to do within it; let's not forget the down right incredible Armor of Romulous that can be earned by finding six scrolls, much akin to earning the Armor of Altair in Assassin's Creed II, but I digress. Gamers will absolutely need a horse to get around, and luckily there are plenty about; another series first, being able to ride a horse in town. This also means there are new, challenging enemies that ride horseback if you spark the guards' interest enough. On the topic of guards, the combat system has been revamped a little bit. Chain kills are much easier to achieve, and Ezio's new executions are as gruesome as they are fascinating.

On the downside, Brotherhood does little in the way of modern-day story telling; not much emphasis is placed on current-era protagonist Desmond Miles, although players are free to exit the Animus at any time before finishing the game. There's very little incentive to do so, aside from collecting a few artifacts, reading a few e-mails, and getting fed some irrelevant, uninteresting dialogue from Lucy and the gang. Where as at the end of Assassin's Creed II, there was at least a sequence to play through as a reward for sitting through the grueling amount of end-game credits, Brotherhood has nothing but a cliffhanger and a 15 minute long, unskippable credit sequence. This title also still has fairly wonky climbing mechanics, although they do seem to be a little improved over its predecessor.

All in all, if you hated the last two releases of the franchise, play Brotherhood; it may very well redeem the series for you with its refreshing plethora of content. If you enjoyed the last two Assassin's Creed titles, then definitely grab this installment. The villains are some of the most memorable in the entire series, the side missions are completely worth spending the time on, and Ezio is just as suave and charismatic as always. Once again, I highly recommend getting The Ezio Trilogy on console if you have one; the remastered set gives breathtaking new life to these old titles with vibrant color, better textures, and upgraded character models.

One thin this game does that I really liked was that you can run your own assassin's guild, send them on missions, level them up, and make money and gain items by doing so. I had a lot of fun with this, although it's not a very big part of the game.

Although the game is more of the same when looking at AC2, there is definitely quite a lot more of it here. Unlike AC2, I ignored most of the side missions in this game, and just focused on the main story. The reason I skipped most of the side content though, was because there was just so much of it. If you enjoy the side activities in AC games, there's quite a lot to delve into here. However, I never really felt it was all that necessary. I only upgraded my items a few times, and was able to beat the game with low to mid tier equipment. So challenge wise I didn't feel the need to level my stuff up.

There is also a nice mechanic in this game, where you are ""rebuilding"" Rome by buying and refurbishing businesses, making money off of investments, etc. After a while I could afford anything in the game, but didn't really need to buy anything. Which I think is a problem AC games have in general. Unless you can offer me something really cool, or unless the equipment is really necessary, the in-game economies never make much sense.

On that note, something else the AC series keeps trying to do but never seems to get quite right is the player housing. I love the idea of having an Assassin's base, but there's really no reason to ever go there, and not a lot of customization options either, so I don't really feel like it became my home.

The story feels very much like a middle game, in that it continues the plot from AC2 but you can tell it's just filler before the third installment.

Overall, a solid, enjoyable Assassin's Creed adventure, although much of the same as the previous game in the series.",1513303520,1513303520,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
48190,38308523,76561198373008989,0,14,2626,0,1196,1521992980,"In 2017 CE I completed AC Brotherhood for the first time.

Brotherhood is the first game in the series that introduced an idea of a 100% synchronization. And let me tell you, I parted with any notion of achieving the sync the way the humanity parts its way with its past - laughing. Basically, I got Don Auditore out of the Room#1 when the timer for the entire dungeon expired.  No need for any eagle vision to see the writing was on the wall: 50% is good enough.

I also was blown away by Ubisoft managing to cram in even more map markers for even more numerous pass-times for those who are intent on squeezing every last second of the purchase of a videogame. In sampler form those missions are not exactly bad, but Ubisoft stretched out something fierce to add Renaissance: The Monopoly  and The Roman Tycoon and Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Cause in one title. So, yup, I burned a few towers, frollicked througha the Romulas’ dungeons, tried to put the saved citizens to a good use and (sort of) kept up Ezio’s income in-line with his (extravagant) needs. 

This time round I said a firm “no” to glyphs and everything else.

Meanwhile, what propelled the game past the AC2 to my second favorite installment in the franchise so far (that’s AC1>AC2:B>AC2 for extra-clarity) was the most cohesive story and absolutely the best villain so far.

Yes, AC2:B regains what AC2 lost - its focus. Granted, it’s not the same focus as in the AC1. The Ancient and Noble Order of the Assassins now reminds Free Masons even more so & Altair still remains as the only qualifying Assassin in the franchise (save for that one secondary character called Mickelotto). But it is a focus nonetheless. 

Ubisoft could not have picked a better focus. I doubt that any of the subsequent games beats AC2:B in that respect. 

Because it's Cesare Borgia! HELLS YES! 

500 years of bad publicity, and the unflattering portrayal in a videogame (that alone would have destroyed any lesser man, I wager) done zip to contain Cesare’s raw appeal and wow factor. The sheer awesomeness of chasing after Cesare smoothed out many cases of having to watch Don Ezio doing idiotic things. Carrying yelling Lucretia all over the Castlo Di Angelo instead of finishing her off and taking the key takes the cake & I guess it was so appealing to Ezio, he had to do it again with a naked guy by Coliseum - by all rights, if Assassins are a force of good, evil deserves to win, ‘cause good is so dumb. 

Anyway, yes, yes, yes, they did it right to focus on Cesare and keep showing him throughout the game as Ezio’s nemesis. Loved that!

I found controls in AC2:B the most stubborn and sluggish, and was disappointed that the only solo thing I can do in the MP module is an intro mission. I thought “everything is permitted” extended as far as letting a fool to get into an MP mission on her own and die whenever. But, well, as bare-bones as Intro mission is, playing a girl-assassin was fun! 

The modern-day stuff was as bizarre and boring for me as ever despite the injection of parkour - but I know there are good folk out there who serioulsy love Mr.Dull and Miss Lucy, so yeah, the game had some of that too and the modern storyline ended up on a cliffhanger.",1513281657,1513282186,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The map difference is nice, being able to go from packed buildings in the commercial district to open grass plains and/or ruins, without ever needing to leave the city walls. Chain kills, a new indestructible armour, a DLC that's all about making up for missed screen time with Da Vinci, achievements that mean nothing, a memory sync meter for unlocking certain secret memories (honestly not worth the extra time to 100% a lot of memories).

Could it better the excellent ACII despite such a short time in between games? This is what I think of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

Amazingly, it did just that in a number of areas. I always used to tell friends that they could be released every year if they maintained the quality and Brotherhood was the first of many to back up that statement.  The graphics quality is a step up from ACII, with excellent character models and colour palettes. The city of Rome and the other areas throughout Italy you briefly visit are beautiful, as always. Jesper Kyd also returns with another enchanting soundtrack. Much improved. on all counts.

The story picks up right after ACII's cliffhanger ending, allowing us to play once again in Ezio's shoes. The story also forges ahead in the present day, with Desmond and company once again on the run from the Templars. Before establishing a new hideout, you get to play a decent sized section as Desmond, which was excellent. The back and forth between him and Lucy in particular is great. You also get to explore the area around the hideout whenever you like, as well as talk to the others a little more than in ACII. I liked that a lot. 

Ezio's story starts with a bang, as the Borgia attack and the game introduces you to the new big bad in Renaissance Italy: Cesare Borgia, son of last year's villain. Ezio, wounded and holding a grudge, rides for Rome to exact revenge and rebuild the Assassin Brotherhood. It is a terrific story, with some memorable missions such as infiltrating the Castel Sant Angelo to rescue an ally. It was uneven in places, however, and I didn't enjoy it quite as much as ACII's story but when it hits its stride it is a great tale. Cesare is excellent in the game, generally stealing the show and being a more unpredictable and unhinged opponent than his father, who surprisingly takes a back seat here.

Gameplay is where the game improves the most. Brotherhood continues to include more variety in its mission design, with many different missions, side missions and things to do in the city that it can be a little overwhelming to begin with. This time around, after taking down Borgia towers around the city, you can renovate much of the city in a bigger slightly silly version of Monterrigioni in the last title. You now have a lot more to spend your florins on, which is great to see. Tombs make a welcome return, this time tasking you with retrieving keys to the Armour of Romulus, a nifty looking Roman set. As before, these are some of the best missions in the game. There is also a new feature that tasks you with optional challenges during every mission, something that would remain in the series in every entry after. It's a great idea and mixes things up during missions.

In this game, you are tasked with rebuilding the Brotherhood in order to take the offensive against the Borgia. This is a fantastic addition, allowing you to liberate certain citizens of Rome and enlist them in your Brotherhood, sending them all across Europe on missions to level them up and gain new equipment. They play a big part in the game, allowing you to call upon them at any time to clear out guards and cause distractions to enable you to remain undetected. Sadly, once they are leveled up there isn't much incentive to keep sending them on missions and you soon forget that particular part of the game. A great new feature if slightly overpowered.

Some old faces return in this one, including your uncle Mario, Caterina Sforza, Machiavelli, La Volpe, Bartolomeo D'Alviano and of course, Leo Da Vinci. All have slightly better models than last time, especially Caterina. She's excellent when she's in the game. A sad miss however is Da Vinci. He plays a much smaller role in this one and the game is poorer for it, in my opinion. He was one of the shining lights of the last game. The friendship between him and Ezio was downplayed this time around. The DLC, The Da Vinci Disappearance, is excellent and there's some great dialogue between the two at the end but again, you don't actually see the man himself that much. A pity. 

Other things I liked was some expanded weaponry and customization. You have much more control of the dyes you can use on your clothes, and they all look excellent. The crossbow was a game changing addition and really helped make stealth a more viable option. However, some of the quests were a little by the numbers in what would later become a problem in the series. As said above, the story also wasn't as strong this time around, despite some great moments, missions and characters.

In all, Brotherhood is a fantastic game, and is better in many ways than ACII. There's almost too much to cover, and it's packed full of content to sink your teeth into. Brotherhood is a very slick experience, and one of the best AC games in the series. Step back into Renaissance Italy and you will have a great time. Don't miss out on this one.",1512491305,1512599080,True,19,0,0.728311836719512939,2,True,False,False

I've played through the entire thing a couple of years ago on my ps3, and hated it.

I decided to give in another go now that i'm on pc, but my opinion towards the game hasn't changed much, if at all, maybe it has even worsen in comparison to my original assessment that this game simply was mediocre at best...

I find it to be a mess in its pacing, fitting cutscenes in the middle of gameplay, provinding minutes of actual control,  only to remove it right after, everything its cosntantly switching back and foward between scenes that don't really contribute, nor tell you anything relevant to the story, or to the characters.

Luckily you can skip most of them, keep in mind I said MOST, others you'll simply have to sit down and watch because ""that's the way the developers intender for it to happen"".

It isn't even done to hide loading times, given thay often times just skipping the cutscene lands you into a loading screen that probably, depending, won't last more than a couple of seconds...

Then there's the gameplay, this is I believe the first, and only, Assassins Creed game that I found to be frustrating, principally because there are certain missions that impose you a certain way of playing, they removed other aspects about the overall liberties you could take as a player, in the way you would tackle certain objectives.

If that wasn't enough the first, true, ""in-depth"" gameplay sequence that you get in the game it's a massive battle in which you take control over cannons that you use to defend a fortress, by shooting at the upcoming... Cannons.

Only to then be thrown yet again into another cutscene, so on, and so forth.

It's as if the developers treated this game as an interactive movie, rather than a game.

And don't tell me this is a game that focuses more into the narrative, and just because of its intention I should be contempt settling for a product that I simply don't find enjoyable for the reasons I've stated before.

I thoroughly enjoyed Assassins Creed 2, Black Flag, and even, for a bit, Revelations, and Rogue.

But that's because those games understood, and respected my time, and the way they could ""fullfill it"" with incredible interactive experience, whilst, simultaneously presenting a compelling, and interesting narrative.

This however doesn't offer that to me.

I am completely in love in this game, whenever I watch the trailer or listen the music of ACB I cannot control myself and start playing it again and again. I think I have completed this game more than 10 times and the progress is still going.Don't look at my hours count coz I had no steam and internet connection that time.  I really enjoyed this installment of the Assassin's Creed series.The game does a great job picking up where the last game left off. The gameplay mechanics are very similar, and the graphics have the same feel, which is not a bad thing. Rome looks great through the eyes of Ezio Auditore. In the previous game your entire base of operations was housed at Villa Monteriggioni which had to be upgraded and renovated. In Brotherhood you must rebuild Rome.There are some new gadgets, weapons, and abilities, but other than that, it feels a lot like AC2. There are pistols and crossbows now, giving Ezio more options to take out opponents at range. Horses can finally be taken through the city, which is extremely necessary. And there are more quick-travel options than in AC2. One of the most helpful additions is the execution kill streak. Through his travels, Ezio has become quite the Master Assassin, and must begin training new recruits. You can choose to assist certain citizens throughout the city and recruit them to your cause, training them to become part of the Assassin’s Guild. When you have trainees, you can call on them to take out targets or assist you in battle. All it takes is a full Assassin’s bar, and a nifty little eagle whistle.Assassin’s tombs have been replaced by Romulus Lairs. 
Soundtrack of this is insane and very heart touching.

It's definitely an amazing game that can entertain you for hours and still make you want to come back for more. It is such an open world game and the things to do sometimes can see limitless. The game definitely builds off of the success and completely bada**ery that both Assassin's Creed 1&2 had to offer. I played this game so many times on the Xbox 360 that purchasing it for the PC was just a must. The new additions to the game make it just even better than the ones before it and it just keeps building up in a positive way. Especially with the most amazing thing they could have ever added, but I won't spoilt it ;)

If you have the extra time and money, definitely get this game. Especially if you love platforming, action/adventure, with some stealth here and there. It is very much worth it.

I also recommend Assassin's Creed 1&2 as well.

It was originally one of my favourite assassin games (of the 5 I've played).

I just tried replaying it today and I've spent two hours doing 10 different follow missions and watching a ton of scripted events and unskippable cutscenes.

I completely forgot about the combat mehanics, they are kind of terrible. Your best option is to stand in the middle of enemies and wait for them to attack. There is no other option as successful.

The few hours of gameplay I mostly sat through were mind numbing. I quit out from boredom and frustration.

It's unfortunate to me that this game doesn't hold up to time because I remember it being fun. But I choose to leave those memories intact and never play it again.

This game was legendary. It was easily the best Assassin's Creed of its time. The introduction of multiplayer was glorious. The game ran perfectly well (albeit I was on PS3), the game was so much fun, the music was a nice depth into the game and time. I love the story behind Ezio.

Today, the game still holds a lot of the same standards. It is still my favorite Assassin's Creed game by far. I am playing through II right now and while that game is still good, I still prefer this one over it because of the overall polish of the game compared to the II.

The general atmosphere, playstyle, and combat is very similar to its predecessor but several improvements have been made.  The keyboard and mouse controls are clearer to use; if you need to press Shift for a certain action the in-game text tells you to hit ""Shift"" instead of a symbol or a controller button.  There is now fast travel available and you can call a horse at nearly any time to improve movement speed.  The game is, for the most part, limited to one city, so these waypoints are greatly appreciated.

AC:B also introduces several new systems that could be considered meta-games.  First, is rebuilding Rome.  Instead of having all of the shops immediately available, you need to invest in openning shuttered stores.  These investments do pay  you back via a bank.  It's a little  tiresome, but indicates progression.  There is also the management of your fellow assassins.  You can send them out on missions to train and return with money/items.  The items system is not well developed.  The assassins can be called out to assist you during the game, as well.  It adds new approaches to completing missions.

There are now also optional objectives during most memories.  Some are entertaining and encourage alternate playstyles (kill X by throwing him into a destructible object).  Others can be tiresome or repetitive (finish memory in X minutes, do not take damage, etc.).  I felt they reduced the immersion; playing a memory repeatedly to accomplish the secondary objective.  

Vehicle combat is pretty terrible, as it was in AC2.  Controls are awkward and hit boxes seem amiss.  I experienced one to-desktop crash over the course of 26 hours of playtime.  I skipped some of the secondary objectives and did not attempt to complete the collecible portions of the game.  

Overall, it's a reasonable improvement over AC2.  Some people will like the additions that AC:B brings, but the game does not force you to use them.  Definitely recommend on sale.",1509291249,1509291249,True,6,1,0.556916415691375732,0,True,False,False

CONS
-Story can be a bit unclear
-Some frustrating 100% sync requirements

I enjoyed AC:B. Of the 2 AC games I have played so far in the series (AC2/AC:B), I would say I enjoy this one the most. A lot of the issues that frustrated me with AC2 have either been fixed, updated, or streamlined into more modern mechanics. 

Controls: Probably the actual reason I stopped playing AC2 years ago on the Xbox 360. Its just so annoying to have your characer do something that you were not trying to make them do, then usually it will result in your death and having to redo missions over and over. I am glad to say the controls have been greatly improved. I found myself swearing at Ezio at least 95% less than what I did in AC2. There is definitely a few moments where I was angry, but overall the controls have improved vastly. 

Story: I felt as if the story was probably the weakest part. It was interesting in the first hour how it picks up directly after AC2 and introduces the antagonist. However, after that I felt as if nothing was terribly significant. Near the end the story went from like 0 to 60 where suddenly theres a war going on and I have no idea whats happening. I was disappointed by how the game just skipped 6 years and BAM, last mission. The Desmond finale was much better than the Ezio ending. 

Overall, I would recommend this game, I enjoyed it more than AC2 and it continues to build on the story. I'd give it a solid 7/7.5. For comparison, AC2 I would have probably given a 6/6.5.",1508798186,1508798186,True,2,0,0.496021240949630737,2,True,False,False

Original review:

I really wanted to be able to recommend this game, but I just can't. Bugs strewn everywhere: people walk into walls, people get stuck on flat surfaces, people walk right through me during cutscenes. Ezio is afraid of stairs, lets go of ledges and immediately grapples the next one down, immediately re-sheathes weapons upon drawing them, keys are ""sticky"" (eg. can't stop sprinting), mouse sensitivity is whack. So far seen, the setting is unsatisfying and feels like a watered down version of ACII.

AC Brotherhood is a direct sequel to AC 2 and should be played in the correct order. It features a vast map of Rome during the end of the 15th Century and dozens over dozens of hours of content. Main missions are interesting if not extremely fun at times except maybe for the most infamously difficult mission in the entirety of Assassin's Creed, namely getting 100% on the DaVinci tank mission.

I had a lot of fond memories of this title and a rough 8 years later on PC instead of on console it is still bafflingly good in terms of gameplay. It also scales absolutely fantastic to 4k and therefore looks anything but dated. It also featured one of the most fun multiplayers so far, except maybe the brilliant co-op from Unity.

Well, mainly because there are so many assets recycled from AC2 in this game; like sound effects, music, animations and menu designs. This game is basically AC2 which a few things added. And that's not cool. AC2 is a good game but we need a refreshing experience here with original assets. This ain't it. Spend the time and money to make a quality title, guys. Come on.

Combat seems less-responsive too. The addition of being able to chain one-hit kills in combat is a nice addition, but the klunkiness kills it. When someone grabs me and the game is telling me to press right mouse and shift at the same time and I'm pressing the f out of these buttons at the same time and nothing is happening I get pissed. The guard is just standing there holding me and nothing is happening until a little later finally another guard swings at my defenseless body to break the other guards hold. I also find blocking and dodging works considerably less in this game vs AC2. It's frustrating when I'm properly pressing the right buttons for dodging a swing from a brute and Ezio just stands there and takes the hit. 

There is a bunch of annoying stuff in this game. 

And these da** automatic cinematic camera angles in some tight spaces like dungons really need to stop. They f up your controls. 

And what's with the recycled music? Why is the synchronization of a viewpoint musical piece copy and pasted from AC2? 

I read some are having trouble getting stuck on the last mission. They think it's a bug. I got stuck there too. The solution is easy, but not obvious: climb up the opposite side of the ladder.",1508053064,1508053064,False,2,1,0.413186758756637573,0,True,False,False

Starting off with the good stuff, the platforming is fun as fuck and effortlessly running from rooftop to rooftop never got old. Very ocassionally it would glitch out in one way or another (e.g not grab onto a platform right in front of me) but it was rare enough to not really hamper my experience.

The tutorials in this game aren't just intrusive, they're obnoxious. In the penultimate mission, there is a sequence where the game prompts you to ""find a way out of [the area you're in]"". The camera then literally pans to where you're supposed to go. I'm not really ""finding"" a way out here, am I? I'd like to think that by the second-to-last mission of the entire game, a player would be prepared for some sort of challenge. By the end of the game, I was still getting prompts for keybindings for basic movement in combat and platforming, too. It's outrageous.

This incessant handholding extends to the combat as well. Not once did I die during my playthrough, and I only got close on one occassion. The combat consists of you locking on to an enemy, waiting for him to attack, then pressing LMB. Then if there are other enemies, press LMB on them as well (no need to wait for them to attack, now you've started a ""combo""). Some enemy types try to spice it up by forcing you to press space to kick them before you can attack them, and it becomes more of an annoying hurdle than an actual challenge.

Maybe this hand-holding would be forgiveable, if there was no filler and the game was short but sweet. But most of the ""story"" missions in this game are boring ""go here, do that, tail this guy"" missions. The best missions were ones where you had to stay undetected, carefully plotting out a route past the guards, which does shine a light on how awful the combat system is.

Speaking of staying undetected, for a game that sells itself as a stealth title, stealth is barely ever the best option. Wherever the game lets you attack head-on, its the best option. Staying undetected takes longer and has a higher risk associated with it.

Despite all these gaping flaws, the game was a pretty enjoyable experience. The story, whilst I didn't get particularly attatched to any character, was somewhat interesting and while the game ends on a ""ooh, buy the next game to find out what happens next"" cliffhanger, they at least put the effort in to make you genuinely want to find out what happens next - and the platforming, when the game wasnt holding your hand with it, was satisfying and surprisingly well-programmed.

I love the setting.
 
I loath the controls, particularly while in combat.
About half the time you jump where you do not want to jump to, you attack who you don´t want to attack or do not attack when you want to. Combat is animation based which is frustratingly unresponsive.
And this game probably has the worst implementation of a crossbow I've ever seen in a game.

A lot of missions are trial and error. The devs created one way to finish the mission and you can forget about trying to find your own way. Sometimes things don't work in a mission as they work everywhere else, and sometimes the camera does it's own thing.

It's not a bad game, it's huge and there are lots of things to do (though kinda rinse and repeat but I can live with that).

So I really enjoyed the fighting mechanics in this game! Sure it takes getting used to, but once you do the counter-chaining flows like water (fuck halberd and spear wielding guys lol). 

The climbing did prove be be troublesome at times (jumping at walls when I thought I'd jump not into a wall). At times Ezio will just sit there clinging to a lefge like ""What? YOU need to move ten pixels to the left for me to grab that next ledge KAppa"". BUUUT I love free-running climbing games (uncharted, tomb raider, etc.) and when it does go fluidly its staisfying as hell. 

The economy system and all of the guild challanges were fun extra content for me to obsessively do/invest in and gave me a sense of RPG elements. I like RPGs so take that as you will (1million funbucks, and growing :D). A few of the guild challenges did feel a bit tacked on and not concievably achievable through 'normal gameplay' of the main storyline (stupid clowns).

The characters are pretty cool. Since I have like no context for the story I'll just say I liked enough to want to know more about it. I really like the ideas that the AC games seem to be trying to convey. Im a sucker for cheesy Sci-Fi (miss you Eureka). 

From watching a BrownMan (Ray <3) video of AC1 I do see that AC: Brotherhood has some nice menu/design/gameplay changes. Its also nice that it seems to have dropped the requirement for doing side missions to further the main story. Though I pretty much banged out all the side stuff I could inbetween main story missions, I did enjoy the 'open world' feeling to the quest progression.

+Globally speaking, while the gameplay of the more recent games of the series is smoother and has a higher degree of visual beauty, this is a solid game that aged relatively well both graphically and gameplay-wise. While the series has evolved a bit since this game came out, it's still a worthy experience.
+The city of Rome is a large, detailed and beautifully rendered open world to explore, and is a really cool setting to play in. While it can be argued that it's annoyingly the only city truly explorable in the whole game, its sheer size and elaborate construction compared to the previous game's locations makes up for it.
+The combat has been graced with a bunch of new animations and (overpowered) mechanics that, while significantly lowering the difficulty of most fights, at the very least makes them entertaining.
+While this can easily be called a filler episode while getting away with it, the plot is still interesting and solid, following Ezio's adventures right from where ACII ended, while also expanding on the present day story as always.
+Good longevity thanks to a decently large amount of main missions (ACII was longer, however), many sidequests and optional tasks and the Monteriggioni management mechanics from the previous game expanded unto the whole city of Rome, which by itself, along with exploration for collectibles, is quite a time-consuming task.
+The game runs right, thankfully, and looks good enough to have aged decently even by today's standards. The Italian voice acting, my main language, is great, but i can't offer an opinion on the english dub.

-While Brotherhood does a great job at cutting out some quirkiness from Assassin's Creed II and improves to some extent in every field, from graphics to gameplay, it's decidedly a ""more of the same"" game with the same general setting, weapons, combat system and mostly the same cast of characters too. You should not expect anything but a VERY surefire follow-up to a hugely successful game.
-The game feels too easy most of the time. If you combo your instakill follow-up to your first kill, you can easily plow through dozens of enemies near-effortlessly, and the rest of the gameplay isn't much more challenging. It's fun, sure, but if you've played this series (or any third person melee-based game, really) you'll have a really hard time dying.
-The side activities can get repetitive.
-Oh, right, this is the first game in the series to feature multiplayer. But it's dead now and it never was amazing, so whatever.

If you liked Assassin's Creed II you will find this game a good but somewhat lazy sequel that doesn't take absolutely any risks, but rather reprises the successful formula with a few tweaks and minor additions here and there.

AC: Brotherhood takes place RIGHT after the events of Assassin's Creed 2 (So, if you haven't played AC 2, definitely play that first) and Ezio is in search of the Apple of Eden as he attempts to save Roma from Templar control. This game's story is really good and it's a great followup to AC 2, and the twist at the beginning is great! 

Since this is a sequel to AC 2, you'll see a lot of familiar faces as you play through. Each character is great and well-written, including the main antagonist, and none of them ever feel boring. They all feel like they belong in the game. Ezio himself, like always, is fantastic. You get the sense that he's matured a lot through is journeys and you get to continue to see him grow as a character.

The setting as well is great and beautiful. The map is rather large, even if you don't really get to go anywhere else besides Rome. There's even flags and treasure to collect, if you're into that sort of thing. The graphics look even better than AC 2, despite there not being much time in between the two. The colors are vivid and the game runs smoothly. 

Now, onto the real reason you want this game (Well, besides for the story and Ezio). The combat system in this game is so far one of the best combat systems we've gotten in an AC game. There's not too much of a difference between AC 2's and Brotherhood's combat system, but it's still fun and satisfying (Not very challenging though saddly). 

Obviously, you're going to need weapons to go into combat. You'll find a nice variety of weapons in the black smith shops, from light, sharp, and fast swords, to heavy and powerful ones, to the typically one-hit kill wrist pistol, as well as hammers, maces, and even daggers for those quick kills. Of course, you also get two hidden blades (Eventually ;) ) The weapons are all well designed and feel fantastic when using them. Also, you'll find armor in the smithing shops that will boost your resistance to attacks, as well as add more health points to Ezio. 

Since you have all of these weapons, it's time for some slicing and dicing (And we're not talking about carrots here). You'll fight an assortment of different enemies, from heavy armored powerful axe/large sword wielding dudes, to light-on-their-feet daggermen, to the basic hammer/sword dudes, pistol dudes (SO annoying), lancemen, and light armored swordsmen. So, yeah, you probably won't run out of things to stab anytime soon. Some of the enemies can be a little challenging, especially when they group up, but they're not all that difficult (And still can't swim! If they just asked Ezio for swimming lessons, maybe he'd do it). They are, however, fun to kill. 

Tired of fighting bad guys alone? Well, this is Assassin's Creed BROTHERHOOD, right? Where's the Brotherhood? Well, guess what...you can now rescue civilians and train them to be assassins! Once you save civilians, you'll be able to put them to good use and train them up. You can call your men/ladies into battle and they'll take out soldiers for you. In fact, if there's not too many soldiers, you don't even have to lift a finger! Once you have enough, you can call in an arrow storm to take out some fools! Awesome! You can also send these guys on missions for you in different areas in Europe/Asia (They'll send you postcards, I'm sure of it!). On missions/contracts, they can gain more levels (max level is level 10) and even get you some much needed cash! Once they've leveled up, you can upgrade their armor or weapon, free of charge. This is a great new mechanic and thankfully made it to Revelations. 

If you need more people for your Brotherhood, all you have to do is take out 'Borgia Towers'. These are restricted areas that are controlled by Borgia (Templar) Captains. Take out the captain, destroy the tower, and the area's yours (Along with an extra slot for another assassin in your Brotherhood!).

While fighting, you might take a few hits so, you'll need to heal up. For that, you'll need some medicine (Just pop some pills, you'll be fine!). Where are you going to get this medicine though? The back alleyway? Nope. Uncle Mario's meth lab? Definitely not. You'll find different venues all over Rome that will sell you much needed supplies (including a doctor that will get you that medicine). Most of the stores are closed though so, you have to upgrade them so they're open. Doing this gives you a discount. There's a tailor, who can dye your clothes and give you storage upgrades on throwing knives, medicine, and the heavy weapon upgrade. The doctor, of course, gives you heals, medicine, and poison. There's also an art merchant, because who doesn't love some Italian art? 

If you're looking for side quests, this game's got it! There's 'shop quests' that allow you to get the best armor (and I believe the best sword) in the game by completing them. All you have to do is find different needed materials around Rome. There's also Leonardo's Machine levels where you help destroy Leonardo's war machines he's been forced to make for the Templars. These are always fun and are usually action packed! (Do all of these and you'll get a reward ;D) There's also some other side quests scattered around, but I'll let you do the exploring. Also, DO THE CRISTINA MISSIONS!!! (BUT MAKE SURE YOU PLAY AC 2 FIRST!!!). If you're stuck on how to get the Cristina missions, they're based off of total sync. Once you reach a certain level of total sync, they will show up on the map (And a message will pop up). 

Overall, AC Brotherhood is one of the best editions to the Assassin's Creed franchise. I HIGHLY recommend getting this game, but like I said before, make sure you play Assassin's Creed 2 first! You won't regret it!",1501362212,1501362212,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

and after playing Syndicate and Black Flag, you can't really return to something like this in terms of plot or script--it's basically a bunch of trite hollywood shite where every side character is either kissing Ezio's ass or cursing him comically.

[h1] A good game, an average Assassin's Creed [/h1]

The game is a decent Assassin's Creed game, but it follows the exact same formula as all early games in the series. Climb a tower, take a leap of faith, find a target to assassinate, kill them, run away, repeat. All while buying a lot of shops to upgrade your gear and collecting the infamous feathers, if you're into that. Whether you like this game depends hugely on how much you enjoyed the previous one.

Most of the game is set in Rome at the beginning of 16th century, although some story missions show places other than Rome itself. As usual in the series, the recreation of society and historical details and information about the places, events and people of the time are a large plus if you're into history. 

The story picks off exactly where Assassin's Creed II ended and follows Ezio Auditore da Firenze (and Desmond Miles) in their quest to find the Apple of Eden. I know that Ezio is considered by many to be the best character in the series, but I personally never grew very attached to him or his adventures. Assassins's Creed: Brotherhood did nothing to make me like any of its main characters more or less than before, maybe except Leanordo da Vinci, who is still great, but there is very little of him in this game. When it comes to the story and characters overall, I felt rather disappointed and the game failed to make me care for any of the people Ezio meets, or even for Ezio himself. It felt more like playing another hero in another action game rather than playing THAT hero in THIS game. The antagonists were not very interesting either, although it was nice to read about the real people that were represented in the game after playing it.

The story ends at a horrible cliffhanger, so if you do want to follow the saga of Ezio and Desmond, prepare to buy Assassin's Creed: Revelations as well. To be fair, the conclusion of this chapter of Ezio's life is there in the game, it's just obvious that there will be more adventures to come.

The gameplay is nearly identical to that of Assassin's Creed II. You watch Ezio climbing while holding down one button, hide among pedestrians, tail your enemies, assassinate them, and sometimes fight guards who tend to encircle you and then patiently wait for their turn to fight, forming a fight club of sorts. The combat looks good, but is very easy. Usually you wait for a right moment to block and counter-attack, and if timed correctly, you kill the enemy instantly AND the next enemy, and the next, and the next... Overall there is little challenge through the game at all. I found it a bit boring at times to be honest, although I did enjoy watching combat animations and solving occasional environmental puzzles. Building and expanding your assassin's guild (an addition in comparison to the previous game) and buying shops often felt more like a chore and in my opinion, could be entirely thrown out of the game without making it any worse. Just time-consuming elements that gave you a sense of progress in terms of money and available gear, but were just not fun to do. Kind of like real work... I'd rather collect better gear by assassinating someone in a side-mission or exploring the map for example.

There are a lot of weapons to use and choose from, as well as some customization options for the armor, which affects not only looks, but also health and the number of gadgets that you can take on a mission. It does give a sense of progress and makes for some variety in a game that otherwise feels rather repetitive.

The voice acting is done well, although the forced Italian accent... well, it can be either cringeworthy or makes for some additional immersion, it's up to you to decide. Anyway, the actors did their part well. The music on the other hand... I don't remember it. I had to re-listen to the ost composed by Jesper Kyd just for this review, and found it hard to describe. It's just so... non-emotional. Technically correct, but there is nothing in it that enhances or destroys the feeling of the game. It just... is. That is a rather big minus, since a good soundtrack can make a difference between a generic scene and a memorable adventure. In Assassin's Creeed: Brotherhood it is just there, not disturbing nor intensifying the game and after playing you don't even remember any melodies.

Wow, that was a lot of critique on my side, more than I thought I would write. Still, this is not a bad game; it's a triple-A title that offers around 20 hours of game-time, including parkour, fighting and assassinating people and solving some puzzles on a large map of renaissance Rome. In my opinion, it just simply fails to be anything more than that; yet another open-world adventure game that doesn't stand out among its competition. And since there are a lot of games in this genre, it's just hard to go easy on this one. I recommend Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood to those who sincerely enjoyed Assassin's Creed II or those who want to play through all the major titles in the series. Others may skip it without missing much.

Verdict: 6/10

48190,33210901,76561198026657379,72,7,1884,0,1851,1559523787,"So I am writing this review on the basis of game functionality with some nods to the gamplay and story itself. I say that because in 2017 I cannot recommend this game because of the plethora of bugs and crashes I faced during my playthrough. I am playing on Windows 10 Pro 64 bit and whether or not it is different on other operating systems is of no consequence since I assume the majority of people will be playing this on that platform and that eventually the majority of people will be using that operating system. 

During my playthough, I had three crashes. The most distinct of which happened during a Follower of Rommulus mission where textures dissappeared and a majority of Ezio's clothes disappeared. The other two happened at random during the playthough. However, it was the continuous amount of bugs that happened throughout that were more cumbersome. Various missions do not progressing because of vsync not being on (Leonardo flying mission, assassination mission, story sequences, etc.), several missions would not even allow for success since enemies could not be defeated and many times I feel into false holes that I could not get out. All of these detracted from the game since you had no idea when they were  going to happen and you had to be hypervigilant to do everything perfectly not to fall into something or on something that would permenatly stick you. With these problems alone I cannot recommend the game. Oddly Ubisoft updates the files through Uplay (happened twice) although it seems only to plug their other projects in the crawl on the opening menu.

Although I will list some concrete postivies and negatives that I found about the game.

Positives:
More Assassin's Creed 2 like gameplay
Having assassin's to call upon is pretty cool

Negatives:
Fast Travel is useless since the points are not labeled on the regular map
Assassin Trainnee program is tedious

Through his many exploits, the Assassin, Desmond Miles’ Renaissance-era ancestor Ezio Auditore has become famous (or rather, infamous) for his charisma and skill, including prowess with his killing implements. But he can’t take down the corrupt Knights Templars’ agents, the Borgias, alone; he must enlist help. He must establish a Brotherhood, one that will strike fear in the agents of evil and bring peace and tranquility to the known world.

This is a very worthy sequel to the second Assassin’s Creed (“AC2”), which followed Ezio on his quest to get revenge against the Templars for the death and trauma caused in his family. At the very end after sparing Rodrigo Borgia (who had become Pope Alexander VI through his Templar connections and overpowering charisma), Ezio was given a revelation by a strange, godlike being called Minerva, who told him that humanity was created by her race; there was a cataclysm long in the past and it would happen again in the future. Whether that has anything to do with the story of the current game has yet to be determined.

What is clear is that you spend a lot more time in the present (2012) in this installment. Desmond, the “real” protagonist; Lucy, his savior and close friend and ally; Rebecca, the techie of the group; and Shaun, the historian with a rather dry sense of humor, find themselves in the ruins of Monteriggione, the Auditore villa, where they set up shop to look for clues to the lost Apple of Eden (an ancient mind-controlling device). Desmond finds himself hallucinating ghosts as the genetic memories he experiences in the Animus come to him as he’s up and about. And Ezio himself has a much more sprawling quest this time around…

He finds himself in Rome, tracking down the orchestrator of the assault on his villa, Cesare Borgia. The Borgias’ influence in Italy’s great city knows few bounds, with their guards nearly full-time on the alert for the escaped assassin in their midst. Fortunately, you can ignite their towers throughout the city to reduce their influence, and buy and renovate shops and other amenities throughout the city much like you did in Monteriggione in AC2.

This is a MASSIVE game, and a highly enjoyable one too! The story is still very convoluted and filled with historical references – for instance, the ultimate cynic and power-player, Machiavelli, makes a much larger showing in this game, and Leonardo da Vinci returns with more fascinating (and dangerous) inventions. Completing missions in certain ways will bring forth Ezio’s repressed memories, which serve as a sort of prequel to the previous game, as Ezio tracks down his crush, the beautiful Cristina, and tangles with his rival/enemy, Vieri’ Pazzi. And there is a mysterious yet extremely hostile faction, the Followers of Romulus (the mythical founder of Rome who was raised by wolves), who wear wolf skins and helmets and attack ferociously like their inspiration; but they are the stewards of wondrously protective armor…

There are so many new side-quests and diversions to try in this game; but then, Rome is a huge city, three times as big as Florence from AC2. But when you’re through (temporarily, to be sure) traipsing through Rome, the multiplayer, new to the series, will test your mettle against your fellow man (the rather surprising back story here being that you play the bad guys: a Templar in virtual training against other Templars). In the several modes, you are given a target (another player) while simultaneously being targeted. Your prey can’t see you unless you run close to him; an indicator shows when you’re close, and extra points are awarded for stealth, ranged kills and averting attacks from your own pursuers. 
All in all, an excellent game; one you can spend hours losing yourself in. I give it five out of five stars!

It has all the problems that AC2 did, bad controls, tedious timed elements that did nothing for the game, etc. only now they actively lock content behind ridiculous requirements that you complete multiple missions in either a ridiculously short amounts of time that DEMANDS multiple playthroughs. Timing is so tight that you basically have to know the optimal path ahead of time, and the junk controls make it pretty random if you'll pull it off even if you know it, or it will require that you fight a huge group of enemies while taking no damage. Fail? You will. It's designed to artificially prolong gameplay by forcing you to do these missions over and over again until you do it perfectly. You can ignore that of course, and miss out on a bunch of the game you paid for, since unlocking some of the game requires you to hit high sync rates. In short. I played this game, I love the setting, I loved the story, but the constantly retrying segments to hit 100% sync sucked almost all the enjoyment out of it on a regular basis.  If I could do it all over again, I'd just watch the movie of it that someone edited together on youtube.",1498709429,1498709429,False,6,0,0.50883859395980835,0,True,False,False

There is a fast travel system in this game, which is pretty good. I don't find myself using it much, however. I find it more fun to run or ride a horse across Rome. 
Lots of different weapons to choose from in this game, and of course you get more of a variety as it goes on. Leonardo Da Vinci appears in this game, which is GREAT.

The story is cool and continues right where it left off. It is slow to start but worth it in the end.

The gameplay is VASTLY improved. The combat is faster and with the ability to chain combos together you don't have to spend a half hour per fight trying to take down the baddies.

The controls are still frustrating and the character movement still infuriating when you are in a hurry..not to mention the horse pathing is absurd (randomly slows down and can jump a fence yet not a 1 foot high rock)

About half way through I was happy that I was finally enjoying this series and loving the improved combat when I learned of the abillity to recruit and train fellow assassins to aid you throughout the game. VERY COOL FEATURE.

Now for the main downside to this game...I would argue that about 60% of the time or even more you have no creativity in your missions. It seems like you almost always have some restrictions present. The missions are always either forcing you to keep from being detected or forcing you into a major fight you would rather avoid or some other such nonsense. Then of course there are entirely TOO MANY timed missions. Just give me a point A and a point B and let me handle it on my own!

All in all, this is a drastic improvement over Assassin's Creed 2 and is in no way a standalone expansion or anything. This is a legit game all on its own and took me over 24 hours to complete.",1498423817,1498423817,True,16,4,0.710075557231903076,0,True,False,False

Do you remember the tailing missions in Assassin's Creed 2 when you followed the Spaniard and his co-conspirators in Venice or Jacopo in Tuscany? Those were great examples of tailing missions done right. You had to follow the target without being seen while overcoming obstacles on the way, be it tall buildings or guards blocking the road and the game gave you the tools to overcome these obstacles the way you saw fit. Courtesans, mercenaries, throwing knifes, ect. And plot was happening! Important information was given to you as you eavesdropped on your targets that was relevant to the main story. They were interesting to play. In this game that all changed in the name of padding. You follow your excruciatingly slow and mute target through open ground, completely unopposed until you're so bored out of your mind you just want to end it all. And not only the main missions but several side missions are also like this. The missions that are supposed to provide a distraction and variety from the main story consists of boring filler. 
 
This game has a lot of filler missions like that along with re-used assets from Assassins Creed 2 since Ubisoft decided to make a new installment in the series every year at this point. The game and the series itself has suffered from this in my opinion, in more ways than one. From the story feeling like it's butter scraped over too much bread to sloppy polish. A lot of graphical glitches happen during combat such as NPC's fighting each other through walls, Ezio doing execution animations in mid air and when you do leaping hidden blade assassinations a lot of the time he stabs the air next to the target's head, something that never happened in the first and second game. It's obvious to me that they worked on making new animations to make the game feel fresh but didn't have the time to polish it enough to make it look good or even work properly.  
 
Another annoying aspect is that some times being discovered causes desynchronization. That's ok in itself but it also counts if a guard spots you milliseconds before you kill them. This led to a lot of unnecessary frustration that shouldn't be there in this type of game, especially in the da Vinci missions where if it happened you were forced to restart the checkpoint. This happens in the main story missions as well, even if you kill the target, if he notices you just for a millisecond it counts as being spotted and you're sent back to the nearest checkpoint. This is unnecessary and frustrating. You have a horse to travel around faster than running but it's plagued with annoying little quirks like when you call him he goes to where you called him from, not to where you were which some times results in you having to chase him around since he runs away from you some times if you don't immediately jump on. The game also doesn't consider walls or hills when you call the horse so some times when you're next to an unclimbable hill and call him he'll appear on top of the hill where you can't get to him or behind the building next to you. It's yet another small annoyance that wouldn't have been there had they had more time to work on it. 
 
The game also has an annoying habit of thinking it knows better where to put the camera than I do which is a real annoyance, especially during chase sequences. It's supposed to help you see where to go but all it truly does is break the flow of the chase and more often than not cause me to jump the wrong way. Games shouldn't do this unless it's a vital part of the gameplay and it's a classic case of hand-holding gone wrong. I truly hate things like this because if I want to place the camera somewhere I have good reason for it. 
 
My favorite feature in Brotherhood is without a doubt the assassin recruitment system where you save civilians and they join your assassin order. You get to send them out on missions to gain rank and you can call them to help you when you're in combat. As of writing this review I can't think of a better implemented mini game in any of the other Assassin's Creed games than this one. The pointless trading mini game from the third one comes to mind here. In this one the mini game has an actual purpose, to train your assassins to become stronger so they'll be better at helping you in the field. I think this is the strongest asset this game has and for that and that alone I love and cherish it.",1496607593,1496607593,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is somewhat ok. I liked story from first. The second one was ok. This one is... whatever. It's not bad, but you would expect little more. 

If you like games like prince of persia or tomb raider, get it. It's a nice game.

[Spoilers ahead and some rambling]

Overall the game is really nice. It has some problems. During fights the camera likes to position itself in odd places, like on top of the tree. This way it gives you some extra immersion. Sometimes Ezio doesn't want to execute the leap of faith correctly and instead of landing in hay you are landing 2 meters from it and break all you bones. These are quite rare that don't really bother that much. What is bothering are missiong with french army. They are really poorly made. It's not obvious what you are suppose to do. But even that is kinda ok. You can play the mission twice, that's not a problem really. Especially that the game is really enjoyable. What is the realy bummer is the last 2 sequences and Desmond ending. Jezzz... You are given the apple. That apple forbids you from using any weapons and you have 3 missions in row to kill enemies. The apple is a purely useless weapon so you watch how your assassins and friends are killing enemies. It's purely boring. Then there is a cutscene where Ezio say in one sentence that we should never use the apple (useless weapon) and the next thing he is using the apple. Then there is a sequence where Ezio is has to go through a battle field (without the damn apple) and kill the main bad guy. That's ok.I really would like if the game would just end there, but no. Then you have some prince of persia sequence with desmond. The whole tension with Ezio is ruined by that sequence. It's actually the most boring sequence in the whole game. The ending.

However, that is quickly shaken off and Brotherhood is a solid entry in the Ezio series. Playing as Ezio is as fun as always, possibly more so as he's got more gadgets than Batman.

Theres quite a heavy emphasis on management, with rebuilding rome or recruiting your own assassins. I like this sort of thing, but if it doesnt set your world on fire you can pretty much ignore it once the training wheels are let loose. The graphics are good, especially considering this was released nearly 7 years ago. 

Rome can sometimes feel overwhelming, with there literally being tons of stuff to do - hundreds of side objectives are available. And this is where I feel it has overstretched itself, content for the sake of content. The plot is quite thin and tends to jump around, with no real sense of flow, just a series of disconnected objectives. 

I hold my hands up and admit that I found Assasins Creed skull-crushing difficult at times, with Altair dying more times than I could count. Ezio seems almost overpowered in this game, and sometimes battles can feel a little too easy when you perform a 15-count execution streak.

First off, I'd like to mention, this is the second game in a TRILOGY - Ezio's trilogy.
So you gotta play them in order. You can't directly start with Brotherhood.
I see a lot of questions in the forums asking this.

That's like asking if one can watch [i]The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers[/i] before watching [i]LotR: Fellowship of the Ring[/i].
Or [i]Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban[/i] before even watching [i]HP and the Sorcerer's Stone[/i].
You might enjoy it but it won't be the same.

Apart from that, there's hell lot of side missions in Brotherhood than there were in AC2 - Borgia Towers, Templar Agents, Leonardo's War Machines, Christina's missions.
If you're the kind of person who does side missions as you come across them, you might take forever to complete the story.
I remember there used to be these instances where, say, I would tell my friend (A huge AC franchise fan) I'm at sequence 3 and after a week he'd ask me again and I'd still be on sequence 3. And he'd be like, [i]""What are you even doing? :/ ""[/i]

Naturally, with all the extra missions and the new Investments feature, it's much easier to earn money in Brotherhood than in AC2.

Story wise, I feel I liked AC2 better since I got to see a transition in Ezio there - from the naive Ezio to Assassin Ezio. But I liked the gameplay of Brotherhood better - more to do and easy to earn and spend.",1493639129,1493639619,True,3,0,0.527972042560577393,0,True,False,False
48190,31467055,76561198065364345,281,11,1822,0,1809,1575628489,"Arguably one of the best Assassin's Creed games out there. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes the mechanics and ideas from its predecessor, Assassin's Creed 2, and refines them. It was an amazing adventure indeed. Slowly establishing your connections throughout the city of Rome and building your Brotherhood was a fun journey. However, like every game out there, it does have some flaws associated with it. 

Pros:

+ Combat. It's been refined and been made much more fun. Ezio can shoot faster with the pistol this time around, and the execution streaks are satisfying to watch.


+ Story: Picks up where Assassin's Creed 2 left off. We are introduced to (somewhat) good characters, and an intruguing plot.

+ Your own Assassin's to command: This is a great addition to the game. We now have our own guild. We can call the members to aid us in combat or get them to take on contracts through which they gain experience and become more and more powerful. You can also customize them with dyes, and the skill points they earn can be allocated to upgrade the armor  and/or the weapons they possess.

+A range of customization: A lot of weapons/armors/dyes to select from .This is always an added bonus for me.

+Soundtrack: Oh god, the soundtrack. So god damn beautiful. ahhhhh

+Graphics: Pretty great for its time, and still manages to hold up to this day.

Mixed:

+/- Climbing: It feels somewhat...inaccurate. At times, Ezio would jump off the specified path and prefered suicide instead. But at times it also felt great.

+/- World Design: I don't know why but i don't feel all that fascinated by the world's design, except for a few places/areas. But i guess that's just me. ;P

+/- Characters: Not all that interesting too be honest. No particular attachment to anyone or rooting for anyone (except for Ezio ofc)

+/- Awkward Color Pallete: The color pallete changes upon entering different districts of Rome. Only one of the filter looks great, the rest of the two look awkward and plain ugly.

Cons:

-Tailing missions: For fucks sake can we please stop them. These are genuinely annoying and frustrating and have no other objective than to prolong the length of the section.

-Optimization: I get awkward stuttering, although i can run a bunch of games easily at 60FPS. And the stuttering can be annoying.

-Easy: The game can be genuinely easy at times.

-Repetitive: Could get slightly repetitve at times as well.


In the end, the pros outweigh the cons. I highly recommend this to fans of the Assasin's Creed genre, and to everyone in general. It's an amazing experience; one that should not be missed. Absolutely loved the game.

I give it a solid 8/10.

I'm a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise, but found myself frustrated with the mechanics of this game on a regular basis. It is in many ways an improvement on ACII, the addition of assassin recruits that you can call to assist when fighting is awesome. The story is also solid, both animus and Desmond arcs, even if there aren't many targets for Ezio to kill (outside of the optional side quests). And the addition of parachutes is great as you don't nhave to worry about falling to your death when you accidently fall from the top of the Colloseum.

However there in lies one of many things that are a niggle aboput this game. The movement is a back step from ACII. Oftenwhen trying to free run Ezio will either jump in the wrong direction, miss a leap of faith or sometimes just stop entirely and star hopping up and down on the spot. Add to this the you will often find that your weapon has been dissarmed and replaced with fists and in one of the Leonardo warmachine levels your vechicle stops responding to your input and this game becomes as frustrating as it is satisfying.

I'm still going to reccomend this game as there are so many more games out there that are worse than Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, which is full of redeeming qualities. That said I would advise against paying full price and look to get it when it's on sale.

Let's see, its a very buggy game, not game breaking bugs but your gonna find yourself in situations where you expect the game to do something but you either freeze or the action your taking keeps repeating itself until you have the brains to turn your brain off for a few seconds and let go off your anger. 
Now to the good part, I very much keep enjoying the music, this time in only one city(Rome) so the game is very static in terms of music but it is a shorter game than Assasin Creed 2 so I was perfectly fine with it. 8/10 music
The highlight of the game is again Ezio and Desmond, they are so damn awesome to follow around. They are not this amazing inspiring characther but they have the ability to make the journey from point A to B awesome.
I cannot believe you guys killed X, I swear to god if Ezio or Desmond dies, there will be violence!

Ps: The game could have done better connecting all the sidequest with the main story, I never got the chance to collect the ancient armour and now that the game is over I dont really care. That and it would have been cool if you had made us conquer some more Borgia towers like in one of those war games where you need to keep the city X colour and yu could win prizes by having X % of the city in your colour. It would make for a more insteresting game and longer without me finishing the game and be slapped with ""Here is 30 more hours of repatead free content that you already pay, dirty whore""

Ps2: The game was too easy, if there was a dificulty change option then perhaps I made a mistake.

It's only been 7 years since this game came out. My lack of age is really showing right now, isn't it?

Yeah, I'll admit it, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an old favorite of mine. My first game for my PlayStation 3 was Assassin's Creed and this girl in my class let me borrow every subsequent AC release. I even asked her out. She said no. I'm a lonely man. Anyways, let's review this game!

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place exactly right after Assassin's Creed II, both in Desmond's and Ezio's storyline. Desmond is being hidden in a new location while the Templars keep hunting him and his Assassin gang down, while Ezio realizes the consequences of NOT killing the main villain of the last game and has to fight his much more evil and powerful son.

The story in Brotherhood is... alright. There are some highlights here and there like saving ""Jesus"" from being crucified, disguising yourself and your battalion as French soldiers to infiltrate a fort, and especially the final level in Spain are some real stand-outs. But the interweaving drama between these climactic moments is pretty dull. It's like Lifetime entertainment's take on what ""drama"" is. For some reason Claudia hates Ezio and La Volpe randomly doesn't trust Machiavelli. These subplots come out of nowhere and are so easily solved it makes you wonder why they were problems in the first place.

While the story isn't A-grade material, what always attracted me to Brotherhood and had me replay it three times (yes, this is my third time playing this bloody game in 7 years), was Rome. This is, in my opinion, one of the best Assassin's Creed sandbox locations in their whole library. If anything even comes close to Rome, I'd say it's the Carribbean Sea from Black Flag, but that's a debate for another time and place. Rome has some real atmosphere to it. 

Rome feels like a dead city with real culture that's had a new culture come by and forcibly build their own monuments and villages on top of it. The poor live in the ruins of Roman architecture while the wealthy live in their Italian villas within the main city. Rome feels very interconnected and the music that changes whenever you go to different sections of the map gives the sandbox a truly unique flow. This is one of the most alive sandboxes I've ever played in an open world game.

Of course, a great sandbox doesn't carry a game. And, unfortunately, this is one of the greater faults of Brotherhood. As a sequel to Assassin's Creed II it doesn't do a whole lot to improve the gameplay as a new installment. You can ride horses inside cities, maintain your own brotherhood, and have a new plethera of gadgets and gizmos at your disposal... but the core gameplay isn't changed that much so the new features feel really tacked on and make the game a f***-ton easier.

The new counter system breaks any challenge in combat you could ever have in these games. It ranks weapons in stores like there's a difference between weight, power, and deflection but you can kill the same amount of guards in a fight with just your bare fists because of the counter system. If you kill one guard you can chain kills until everyone lies dead around you. Where's the challenge in that? Where's the fun?

The Brotherhood mechanic also takes away a lot of potential fun. You can now train assassins to go across the globe and perform various tasks... that you can't watch. And when they return you can have them kill your targets for you. But, again, where is the fun in that?

That being said, the micromanaging you do through Rome by maintaining your Brotherhood, buying out businesses and ruins, and going on various side-quests always managed to latch its talons deep into my brain. There's something about mindlessly running around and performing small tasks to accomplish a greater good that makes me forget about how mundane and terrible my own life is, and then I don't have to worry about the swirling abyss that is my inevitable death and I... oh god... no... NO! NOT AGAIN!

*ahem* Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a precursor of what was to come to this franchise that has been slowly drained by Ubisoft to this day. They keep thinking that ""innovation"" is just ""adding some more sh** on top of the formula"" and it works in this game. Assassin's Creed II was more like the child in the front of the class that took notes and got a fair B for its great effort, while Brotherhood is sitting in the back and just follows its friend's lead by barely scraping away with a C. And that's pretty much was Brotherhood is. Good... but not as good as Assassin's Creed II. A decent experience that has lost its charm and magic it used to have over me as these years have passed. I'm giving Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood a 6/10.",1488680783,1488680783,True,28,9,0.733041763305664063,5,True,False,False

AC:B organically develops both Desmond's and Ezio's arcs, introduces fresh villain (my favourite from the series), gives us new historical city to parkour in and even manages to introduce multiplayer, the first ever AC title to do that.

Ezio is now the Grand-Master of Assassins and wants to enjoy his vacation after practically single-handedly dismantling Firenze and Venice Templar cells, a journey that took 20 years of his life... all for revenge. Turns out that he pissed off that ONE man he shouldn't have while doing it. Thus, series of unfortunate events will lead Ezio into the heart of once-great Roman Empire - Rome. A heart corrupted and totally under control by Templars and their new Headmaster - Cesare Borgia. But fear not, for Ezio is not alone in this fight, now he has support, manpower and resources of entire Assassin's Creed.

+ Interesting story with unexpected turns right from the get-go

+ More insight into Templar Order and their personal feuds

+ Greatly improved combat (bad-*ss chain-executions, secondary weapons are finally useful mid-combat, new enemy types, crossbow - FINALLY (it was actually teased in the original AC, now we finally have it))

+ I just have to point out the villain - Cesare Borgia (fearless, smart, cunning, has connections and has abolutely unquenchable thirst for power)

+ Your very own team of new assassin recruits, that you can rely on when outnumbered or cornered (or when you do not desire to mess your own hands)

+ Rome is beautiful and BIG (much bigger than Firenze and Venice combined!)

+ MP, I guess? (not a fan of it, I like SP in my games, but it's fun and I recognize that)

- Horse-riding could use polish

- Tower-unlocking can get a bit tedious if done in one go (you have to assassinate district commandant in order to ""liberate"" a district)

- Collectables might get quite overwhelming

To summarize, AC:B is one of the best AC games ever, with great optimization and even better graphics fidelity. Combat is a never-ending fun and stealth is sometimes hilariously easy with the crossbow and your team of assassins. Parkour is improved and now you are not stuck figuring out how the hell are you going to descend from this hill without breaking every single bone in your body - you have parachute now: kill guards with style!

Is is a fantastic addition to the series, and if you like Assassin's Creed II, you'll love AC Brotherhood. It adds many cool new features, new dynamics to fights and new things to do around a beautifully recreated 16th century Rome.

But I have to say: I've encountered a bug in almost every mission. Or a gamplay problem or stupidity. E.G.: there's a mission in which the game tells you to [b]Follow[/b] a group of people, when in reality you're supposed to say [b]ahead of them[/b]. Some missions have a requisite of, for exemple, not being detected by guards to achieve 100% sync and that's ok, but sometimes after a cutscene the game repositions you and puts you right in the middle of 75 guards all looking at you. Kinda hard not to be detected. I also experienced a few graphical glitches (things like a part of the roof or peoples' clothes disappearing), but I can't really say these graphical glitches were a problem to my experience playing the game.

I've also come across a glitch in one of the last missions where the cutscene wouldn't start after I got where the game told me to go. I had to restart the game and try again. Thankfully, it worked this time around. This seems to be a pretty famous glitch that has never been fixed. And it sucks [b]a lot[/b] go through such a bug when you're in a such a great environment, running for your life and at the same time trying to kill an enemy, but you are forced out of that immersion and have to hope for the bug not to happen again. I saw people on the internet saying they fixed it by chaning display resolution, Vsync, monitor frequency, but there seems to be no apparent reason for the glitch [i]not[/i] to happen. Seems to be pure luck. And I hope you are lucky enough not to experience any bugs in this outstanding game.",1483720441,1483720701,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Riding through town, fast-travel points within the city, kill streaks, brutal new animations and mission-replayability are some of its many improvements, fixing a few negativities I found in the previous game.

Instead of just rebuilding his family villa, Ezio is tasked with liberating a Borgia-oppressed Rome and bringing it to its former glory, with the help of not only a few old friends, but of a new Brotherhood as well. Assist citizens in need and watch them rise through your ranks, ultimately shaping Master Assassins to aid you in your quest. The main antagonist is ambitious, vicious and ruthless, stopping at nothing to achieve his goals, which, in turn, make his every appearance exciting.

Unlike former entries, Brotherhood offers a wide variety of interesting side quests, such as excellent tombs to explore, advanced war machines to destroy and templar agents to silence, even though they mask the rather short length of the main story. Rome is filled with great sights, which help make every area feel distinct from the last, and, for the avid completionists, accomplishing eveything didn't feel as great a chore as Assassin's Creed 2 did, although the reasons for that may vary according to each player.

Sometimes you can break a hold, sometimes you can't. It seems to be entirely random whether or not your attempts to attack, counter, block, or dodge are going to work, resulting in even a modest number of guards able to whittle your health down significantly.

It improves on a lot of things from AC 2 and it is overall a masterpiece in design and execution but I personally prefer AC 2 because I think the story was slightly better and I preferred Venice and Florence over Rome for the setting but I still really love Rome in this game. Just like AC 2 the recreation of the city really makes the world feel real and the attention to detail is just outstanding. The combat is much improved from AC 2 with the kill streak mechanic they added and it overall just feels more natural and free flowing. The animations are so fluid and on point it’s great to look at. The way Ezio dodges each attack when he counters with the hidden blade and then just going seamlessly between enemy to enemy is masterfully done. The combat in this game is the best in the series and it slowly started going downhill after this game to the point where I started to dislike the combat by the time AC Black Flag came out. Soundtrack is beautiful and just as good as AC 2’s. They added so many new little features and tweaks to the overall gameplay and design (just like AC2 did from AC1) that it feels like a whole new experience and not more of the same like the franchise ended up being called out for later. When people say this game is their favourite in the franchise I can definitely see why.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is eine wirklich gelungene Fortsetzung zu Assassin's Creed Brotherhood!

Wir bestreiten erneut die Taten unseres Ahnen Ezio Auditore. Es gibt auch ein sehr nützliches Feature! Wir leiten eine Gruppe von Assassinen, die wir Stück für Stück freischalten können. Diese unterstützen uns bei unseren Missionen bzw. können zu eigenen Aufträgen geschickt werden, für diese wir Gold erhalten.

Alles in allem ein schöner 3. Teil der Assassin's Creed Reihe!

Viele Grüße

Rome is one of the greatest cities to be mapped out for a game and they did a spectacular job.  The plot up to this point has been great.  AC2 was too long in my opinion but AC Brotherhood is nicely balanced.  You also get some long awaited closure as far as the Borgias are concerned.

As with AC2, the ending seem grafted on, but not as bad this time.  So I am still enjoying the plot for both Desmond and Ezio.  At the end of the day, having Rome as your personal playground makes this a great game.

Set between 1499-1509 Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place immediately after the plot of Assassin's Creed II, featuring the 16th-century Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in Italy and on his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family.

 Intersecting with these historical events are the modern day activities of series protagonist Desmond Miles, who relives his ancestor Ezio's memories to find a way to fight against the Assassins' enemies, the Templars, and to also prevent the 2012 apocalypse.

 Assassin's Creed Brotherhood introduces rectruabile Assassins to the game. Ezio can now recruit new members to the Assassin Order by destroying any of the twelve ""Borgia towers"" around Rome where the papal troops are stationed, then by rescuing disgruntled citizens in their districts from the harassing guards.

There are new enemy archetypes in addition to those that were seen in AC II such as the horsemen, arquebusiers, the papal guards and others. Horses now also have a much larger role in AC Brotherhood, not only used as a means of transport, but also as a component of different acrobatic sequences and also so much more advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is also the first game in the whole Assassin's Creed Franchise to feature multiplayer which consists of three game modes, Free for All, Co-Op and Team. This game is just full of amazing detail in every aspect; The story, Graphics, ambiance, environment, sound and much more.

 I really recommend this for the mere fact that it's just always fun to play, and there is just so much things that you can do in the game. I absolutely cannot recommend this game to you enough it really is just absolutely outstanding. So once again I highly recommend that you get this game because I'm sure you won't regret it.

Just a one large city (Rome), own assassin guild, tons of sidequests and a lot of good stuff from all previous games.
Very good thing is also that from ""present times"" you have just a few minutes.

I loved figuring out the Lairs of Romulus and liberating Rome one Borgia Tower at a time. They introduced assassin recruits which I found very enjoyable and super convenient--you can summon them around any guards or enemies. On occassion they stole the main kills which was a little more than irritating. 

As usual, the game is visually gorgeous, but I expect no less from Ubisoft at this point. They simply don't put out ugly games, at least I've never seen one in recent years from them.

I was hoping for more bromance with Leonardo but he wasn't nearly as relevant of a character this time around. His missions were completely optional and I haven't done them yet so I don't know if it leads to anything special when you do them all.

But that's another thing to love about AC:B. There is SO much to do. I spent hours not even paying attention to the campaign just wandering, causing trouble, doing side missions. I also enjoyed leaving the Animus too. I personally am very interested in the present-day stuff. It's all leading to something huge, and I'm looking forward to some heavy hitting games in the series the next couple of years.

Ezio is as loveable as always. And Claudia!! She's awesome and I wish there had been more of her. I feel that there was a whole lot more potential to her story than was given. It'd be so cool to see a spinoff just about her over the years, but the chance of that is next to nothing I'm sure. 

The campaign was great, but the last two sequences were spectacular (nine in total). Sequence 7 had a BRUTAL tracking mission that I loathed entirely, but the payoff happened soon after and was very satisfying to play and to see--probably the most visually striking parts of the game were near the end.

It didn't hit me as emotionally as AC2 but they did a damn good job with Brotherhood. Looking forward to the last in Ezio's trilogy.",1465882905,1465882905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
