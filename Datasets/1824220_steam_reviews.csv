I have alot more hours into the game than this states, I bought this twice on Epic and on Steam and collective between both accounts, im sitting around level 240. 
What has me upset about the recent update is a few things so ill list:

- Cheating; cheating is a hugely widespread issue and the sad fact is, developers do not act against reports. They don't. Cheaters I've met carry on cheating the next day and nobody at Torn Banner gives a fuck. Their implying case that its some kind of priority of theirs is laughable and ridiculous. 

- Denied mod support: despite the community wanting mod support so custom servers could be utilised, Torn Banner announced that (despite the easy implimentation) they would never add mod support into Chivalry 2's lifespan. This just sucks.

- Negative Tweaks: the developers thought it was a great idea to purposely mess up the spawn system so players spawn behind walls and often far far away from the objectives. The theory ive been given by a veteran player is that they wanted new players to experience more of the map and to make matches last longer -  despite them nerfing the amount of gold and XP you get. 

- Tenosia update: by far, the Tenosia update is the community's most disliked update. Lacking content, annoying voicelines and EXTREMELY unbalanced maps - the developers fell really short on that update. Since then, they have not tried to solve any of those issues.

- Lack of Support to Gamemodes: they recently teased theyd be doing a FFA map. This is amazing - but its been a long time coming and they haven't done anything to other gamemodes for a long while. The focus on shit like peasant last man standing is just really dumb and the thing is, I meme when I play. I never play serious so playing peasant would be right up my alley - but we already have that shit and we could just experience that in a subclass or some shit. It'd be nice to maybe get *just* a siege map, where its a TDM obj kinda thing of just a castle and short match fun shit. but yeah, lack of FFA support is sad too.

Don't get me wrong, I love this game. It's why I bought it twice and have even gifted it to a friend to play with me too - but its just a sad case of developers not listening or caring about their community. 

This just isn't worth it at full price and i'd  recommend to also wait until the developers support other gamemodes and their community.",1708929837,1708929837,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of my favorite games! It has such well made core mechanics that the game really doesn't get boring, IF IF IF IF you are willing to learn the game itself and have an interest in games with a high skill ceiling. This game is a blast for those like us. It has a fun competitive scene with quite a few other players, and does have really great and well made team objective base content.

The only thing holding this product BACK is a lack of MORE CONTENT. The base content starts getting recycled after a few hours of playing. There just isn't enough at all.

Those of us who play for the high skill ceiling are just a small percentage of the player base and certainly I will never get bored of those high level competitive duels and the competitive nature of the core game, as long as there are players to play against simply due to the content of the game being player driven inside those competitive variables.

 But this is NOT enough to keep, I think, the majority of players intrigued or interested long term. There is so much potential in this game..... Just being wasted.

*** This game has two MAJOR FLAWS; Torn Banner *1* refuses to acknowledge mod support which would propel this game into stardom and *2* doesn't develop base content quickly enough or nearly ever to make it fun long term for anyone who isn't willing to put in hundreds of hours to join the competitive scene ***

Until Torn Banner stops acting like the ""Insert name of powerful company who lost its edge because of stupid a** decision making and business planning"" (Nokia, AOL, the list goes on) of this particular genre, this game will not see the success it could have.

Torn Banner has made a gem at its core. But a core isn't enough to keep everyone interested or having fun.

This all points to my overall reason why I lean towards a negative review. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the game. I love the competitive scene and play quite a bit. The game just isn't what it could be, and is missing a shi* ton of content for 40$. It isn't worth purchasing at the moment. In my opinion - Unless you love learning mechanics of a new game and can see yourself investing hundreds of hours to really join the comp scene.

Just one Example of the oversight Torn Banner is totally missing - The boss style fights that occur near the end of a Team Objective - Could you imagine those being monsters? Could you imagine the absolutely insane things modders could come up with? Templars vs a god level boss? What the f*** are you doing, Torn? You've designed an amazing game, with game mechanics fun as hell, and then in so doing you have created for yourselves the ""I found some minor success, and so we shall now try not to break what is working"" successful product limiting syndrome box.

Mod support would take this game from 100-1000 really f***ing fast. Get with it, Torn Banner.

Or just hire a new team to do it yourselves.....",1656627950,1708806420,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Holding block, the utility of kick being split in half to allow for the jab mechanic which feels like it wasnt very thought out, a few unsavory balance elements that I wont go in detail on, etc. etc. But I have to also criticize the game objectively for a few reasons, the first of which is that the hit registration is dog shit, and im not the only one that feels it. I cant count how many times Ive been hit by someone AFTER my attack visibly connects but neither does damage or interrupts their attack, or maybe ill hit a teammate when the enemy should be hit first. Another thing is the initiative you gain after landing a hit just doesnt exist. This is a HUGE problem in my opinion because the tutorial in the game tells you that youre at an advantage on someone after landing a hit but again, I cant count how many times Ive taken a hit after trying to use this fabled ""advantage"". Ive also noticed when I party up with 1 other person and try to join the 3v3 queue there will be times where we get put in the game, but either one of or neither of us show up on the scoreboard so we cant play. It doesnt happen every match or every 2 matches but it happens enough to the point it gets frustrating, Especially when you can wait 5-10 minutes sometimes just to be put against the same team that destroyed you last game. This is something ive heard noone else talk about but im willing to bet im not the only one its happened to.

With all that being said, this game can be enjoyable. The epic battles across huge fields and massive castle towns is unmatched by any game out there (that ive played) so if thats something youre looking for above all else, then give this game a shot, But if youre like me and want a mixture of awesome medieval sword fights and sieges on top of some fun easy to learn hard to master type mechanics, Id personally point to Mordhau for this type of experience.

- Beautiful Graphics 
- Great Music
- Great effects
- Very fun. 
- Welcome introduction of the chambering.

HOWEVER! 
- The held block system is a huge departure from the original Chivalry 1 gameplay. As a Chiv 1 player, i found myself very frustrated with features missing giving an edge against other players in pvp. 
- Cannot crouch dodge most side swipes, therefore the feature is gone, giving any GI joe a chance to win by design. This is a big NO. 
- Held block allows for gankers (* Many players to zerg rush you ) And you have little space to combat them by design, even with high skill level. Many nerfs on character movements, sword speeds, and slow windups dont allow you to fight a large group, evidently ending with your death. 
- Game appears to be designed to cater the maximum amount of people, rather than give breating space for players to develop interesting techniques. 

Unfortunately, i will have to not recommend the game. I am a Chiv 1 player, i was the best at most of the games. And i have been so through skill and technique ( even though with keyboard and mouse ). Through timing, feints, drags, and patience. 

This game however? ... too many crutches for the average nub, too many nerfs on quick weapons, Too many safeties such as held block. I am disapointed, and do not recommend it to chiv 1 players.

Edit: I still give this game a downvote. 
The held block feature acts as a crutch for new players. Giving little time for feints,

[h3]1)[/h3] Teammate indicators are tiny, easily blend in, and just disappear 5-10 meters away. That makes reading the battlefield unnecessary hard. 3rd person view helps but has a fixed narrow FOV that looks very bad.

[h3]2)[/h3] Big battles are rarely a line vs line, and more often dudes trying to run around and backstab as much as possible, or 2-3 players ganking on some dude that is separated from his team. This tactic or flow would be fine if it wasn't so much reinforced by movement mechanics and bad team indicators (1st point).
[h3]2b)[/h3] Movement mechanics problems are: very fast top speed (it builds up when holding W), and very slow low speed (first steps forward, or walking sideways/back). The battles look like everybody is a cavalry unit: they hit & run through, circle around to hit unsuspecting enemies. If you're in melee range, its very hard to disengage to seek your team, and there's also a catch up mechanic that gives speed boost to chasers. The incoming enemies with top speed will make sure you're gangbanged thoroughly, and you're entirely dependent on teammates either helping you or running off.

[h3]3)[/h3] Unoptimized controls. Can't bind ""dash"" to separate key (its merged with ""jump""). 
Why when i press ""Slash attack"" two times in a quick succession, it doesn't do a ""Slash"" -> ""feint into Alt Slash""? It should at least be a toggle-able setting. Its inconsistent, because pressing ""Slash"" then ""Overhead"" makes you feint without the need for Alt Attack Modifier. Same thing with countering, if i'm doing ""Counter->feint into Counter"" with the same attack type, just make me press the same attack type again (why do i need to use ""Alt Attack Modifier""). For countering, at least i found a fix for this: bind both ""Alt Attack Modifier"" and ""Parry"" to RMB - that way you do first counter (alt modifier on), release RMB and can do a second counter just by pressing attack.

[h3]4)[/h3] HUD: no mod support to change it. Health and stamina are bottom left, too far from center of attention.

[h3]5)[/h3] Slow, muddy and clunky feel of combat. The thing i most hate is the mouse sensitivity limiter during attack release. I understand why limiter is there, but its just a band-aid fix, and there are other ways to achieve good looking combat.
Because of sensitivity limit, you kinda need a huge mousepad.
When i see a very slow attack / drag, that hits like a truck, it immediately breaks immersion. Someone gently touches me with a hammer or axe, and i lose half of my health. 
Feels like going into parry isn't instant, and there's a delay after you drop a parry, where you cant do anything and can still get hit or kicked to guardbreak (maybe the game isn't meant to be enjoyable for 50+ ping).

[h3]6)[/h3] Attacker advantage in TO. 
All map stages except the last one, are almost guaranteed to be lost by defenders => feels lame to even try to defend them, feels so artificial, like a sightseeing tour. 
On the other hand, playing attack is more fun cause you have more chance to wipe the opposition and push through like a hero.
Attacker team is often stacked by better players. Its obvious at first two stages when they will steamroll through the map. 

[h3]7)[/h3] No good training mode, bots are pointless, can't train certain mechanics or moves on your own. There's a tutorial, but it only serves as an introduction, weak one at that.
To get good you're reliant on dueling servers, playing against veterans that aren't there to teach you, and you have no replay function to see your mistakes.

[h3]8)[/h3] This style of ridiculous, weird and cranky medieval setting, is just not for me. The objectives, the narrator, the voicelines are very silly.

[h3]9)[/h3] Attack animations vary in quality wildly, somehow they can be both hard to read and ugly looking (sometimes its just the veterans manipulating the system with accels/drags).

[h3]10)[/h3] 3rd person vs 1st person dilemma.
In Team Battles, 3rd person view is way better, you get more results with it. But it also looks worse (FOV too narrow) and not as immersive (1st person animations are solid).
In 1st person, considering bad team indicators, sensitivity limiter during attacks, the need to aim when parrying, losing sight of the enemies if i'm doing an accel - means i just don't see what the hell is going on.
Someone in 3rd person just sees the battlefield much better, he can see what's happening behind the row of fighters in front of him, and directly to his sides - so all the mentioned problems in 1st person view have way less impact.

[h3]---[/h3]
Overall this game seems questionable to sink my time into, its a gamble whether or not higher skill will solve above issues. The game's style, design decisions and quality problems are reasons enough for me to drop it.

One simple google search will show you how they do it.  They aren't genius hackers, they simply use a program that someone else wrote.. and guess what, it's free of charge to them.  I report cheaters OFTEN, at least 10 times per session, yet the developer does absolutely nothing about it.  I've emailed them repeatedly and the only email I ever got back was a confirmation to tell me they got my email.  I just wanted to know if they do anything about cheaters.  But, the proof is in the game- You can report someone until you're blue in the face, even start a different game, then see that same cheater the next time you're on.. and they'll still be cheating.  My guess is they don't care.  It's another player, right?  Maybe that gives them a lot of players for now- but with that model, you'll win the battle and never the war..  Maybe not today, maybe not next week, but people will move on.. you can only take so much.  

The main cheat you'll see is ""speed-hacking."" They'll pick a weapon with high damage and hack it to be a speed similar to a knife.. Who likes playing against someone who has a giant advantage?  So because I'm honest and have integrity (therefore I REFUSE to cheat), I have to put in twice as much effort to beat a cheater, while they effortlessly take first place and gain all of the benefits that come with it.  I've become good at this game, my rank is over 500 and I have 572 hours on it.  You can't stare at the same screen for 572 hours and not notice things that are out of place.

The core gameplay is fun but the devs have made multiple bad decisions.

Team Objective game mode is inherently flawed with no signs of it getting fixed, The way it works is the attacking team needs to finish objectives to get to the next area of the map and the defenders need to prevent them from doing these tasks. Since people would not see much of the map if defenders were on equal footing from the start they ""balanced"" this by giving defenders significant disadvantages such as significantly longer respawn times and being spawned farther away from the objectives than attackers, defenders tend to get less rewards with more hassle.

The auto balance is bad, this means that players will almost always create an unfair advantage such as stacking all the skilled players on one team or having significantly more players on one team. The auto balance will move people if there is somewhere near four more people on one team than the other but its easy to avoid There is nothing preventing people from doing this.

Cheat prevention is non-existent, there is a report function in the game but all of these reports in regards to cheating are ultimately all ignored, there is cheating to the point of people having youtube channels dedicated to blatantly cheating on the game and they have never been punished. It feels like they are actively promoting the use of cheats more than preventing it.",1656461314,1708044954,False,0,0,0.506933748722076416,0,True,False,False

The maps feel very evenly matched and it all together more fun. I have enjoyed myself so far.

There's a couple bs things here and there, like catapult stones having the power of 5 pounds of C4 and killing 7 people at once. But it's not a big deal when you've played Mordhau and the PVP is so off balance where as here, as long as you are blocking and use your special and charges correctly, you can beat even high level players in a battle.

respawn system was great, keeps you in the action with very little downtime despite high lethality meaning you may die quite often

the tone is pretty well-struck, a bit of Monty Python and the Holy Grail medieval comedy 

good variety of customization options for characters

cash shop seems limited exclusively to cosmetics, no classes or maps or anything locked behind paywalls

But the game has a lot of issues in meta, weapon balancing, and horribly jank animations for some weapons/manuevers (much less than Chiv 1, but still an issue).  Luckily the party functionality finally works (only took them over a year...).  That said the #1 problem the game has is team balancing, or really the complete lack thereof.  The game sorta kinda thinks about balancing teams at the start of a match (even though the only metric it seems to be based on is ""level"" which is more a function of playtime than skill), but after that lets people put themselves on whichever team they want as long as there is space.  This leads to team stacking from experienced players onto (almost always) the attacking team so that they can win and get more kills, which has the side effect of making for frustrating gameplay for everyone else.

Recommended if you just want to mess around (though I suggest disabling chat because it can be SUPER toxic/racist/etc), and more so if you have people to play with, but there are a lot of issues to be aware of.",1707332781,1707332781,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

*At the start of every match you know whether you are going too win or lose based on your map and whether youre attacking or defending with a pretty high level of accuracy. Defense is fucked the majority of the time and on some maps its almost impossible to compete. 
*There are no elos or kds to split higher skill players evenly across teams so super teams are fairly common
*if youre on the winning team and doing well theres a good chance that you may be auto balanced from the winning team and basically forced to take a loss at the end of a game
*Players crank their mouse DPI so high they may spin completely before completing a swing of their weapons.

 If the things listed above wont piss you off too much the game is a blast. combat is fun and every weapon is completely different. text chat is vile and also hilarious. 

there are sooo many easy fixes that could be done to fix balance and improve gameplay on maps its almost comical. 

1 offense tends to have WAAAAAAY too much time to attack for each stage.
2 put a simple ticket/spawn count system like sooo many other competitive games for the offense.
3 put a max possible rotation for players when swinging their weapons (might already be a thing i play on controller now). ive seen players rotate like 720 degrees before swinging which is absolutely ridiculous.
4 archers either have to have a max spawn per match or stage or their arrows should only work on classes that have less visible armor. 
5 there needs to be more tight corridors or choke points so that defense has spaces that they actually can feasibly fight to protect.
6 every stage that is outside but players are to light things on fire needs to be redone. they are almost never competitive in the slightest.
7 for the love of god stop letting catapults be able to destroy every objective from 5000 meters away where defense has NO chance of stopping them.
8 Engineers NEED to get points for each barricade destroyed, there needs to be more incentives for them to be bothered with in objective game modes and there just isnt.",1688561796,1707105464,True,1,0,0.516574561595916748,0,True,False,False

update 4: the bugs are back more than ever. unfortunately this game is an up and down , at the moment it is in very deep trouble.

update 3: 
a lot of bugs got fixed. and the game can be a hell of fun when you look over certain issues: 
- still buggy, but the invalid join data and easy cheat problems seem to be gone. 
- people switch way to often to the attack team and it gets very quickly imbalanced. and newbies getting then trashed in the defence. for some this might be fun, I think it is a waste of every ones time when matches end 200 to 600 kills. it should be like in sport and a good challenge, but some people can not loose on a normal base and then changing into the winner team. 
- atm overheads are quite buggy way to many are going through people. 
- the maps are often beautiful, but the surface is not smooth. still getting stuck way to often on blank surfaces. also some people seem to be able to hit trough walls while your swing gets stuck. might be an animation issue, have seen it too many times.

otherwise enjoy the comedy.



update 2:
This game is not finished. It crashes way to often with different errors and every hotfix seems to make it worse. 
You spent more time fixing the game then playing it. Really unfortunate. 

first review:
I love the game, but..
Why I cant recommend it? Easy cheat bug shows up after 60 hrs of playtime. no real fix available. you have to fix your game by yourself and on the next day it is broken again. game crashes way to often, when you place something on the ground or when you end it. closing Chiv2 causes it to crash. I first thought this was on intention as the first one had the same issue. 
all this issues 3 years after release...it is a riddle to me.",1679895141,1707024513,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Chivalry 2 is a fun medieval game that whilst not offering the customisation and freedom Mordhau does, what it does do right is fights that look like real fights and the gameplay while lacking slightly less depth than mordhau, is significantly less prone to animation abuse and the game is just overall much more intuitive. 

Where Chivalry greatly excels over Mordhau is maps and its onboarding for new players, while new players can still be mopped up by veterans, a veteran will use kicks, bashes, feints and dodges to beat a new player, while a Mordhau veteran can simply break the animations to excel or drag until your parry runs out.

of course they added battlepass stuff (if that's your thing, cool). there is no real restrictions on teamswitching, so those other 9/10 times the level 1000 players all just stack on one team for an easy steamroll win. yesterday the game only had 1800 players online (at least on steam) at what i would think would be peak time in my region so i wouldnt really say it's dead, just getting there since it can take 5 minutes to find a match sometimes. as with any game like this, ganking is the only real strategy so prepare to die hundreds of times to a 5v1, but i guess im just whining and complaining about that because i've been told to just go play a duel server. still very frustrating. finally, the game just feels kind of abandoned to be honest. the only thing i can distinctly remember being added post launch is the tenosia faction and multiple people in the discussions here on steam have said that over the course of 2023, there was only one ""content"" update. maybe its because i play the 40v40 stuff, but it feels like there's not enough maps and just in one 1-hour game session i end up playing the same rotation at least three times

edit: as of today, 03.02.24, i am unable to access the game. ""login error: request timeout or null response"". seems the developers have seen my negative review criticising the way they handle the game and have banned me. all jokes aside, how could i possibly recommend a game you cant even access after purchase? i've seen several posts saying this error is usually caused by server overloading, but if that's the case that speaks volumes as there's only 2000 players online on steam. even ubisoft has better servers",1706639356,1707007115,False,7,2,0.539942622184753418,0,True,False,False

Chivarly 2 is a larger game and you won't have trouble finding a server, a added bonus is that most servers will be mostly full at all times.  The Graphics are great even for medium computer like mine (Looks terrible on low settings) and the core of the combat is wonderful, I really liked Mordhau's combat system but i find my self like the core and i specify core combat more appealing given its ease. I appreciate the level of detailing that went into the map design as every map has a sense of awe about it.

This is all the positive things i can say for chiv 2 and here are the negatives (in my opinion)

1: Customisation is lacking at best, Mordhau has an extensive array of armor to the point that everyone in a server looks different, you can change the colour, the material even the foot piece and gauntlets can be changed. Chiv is different there is very little in the way of significant changes to overall look and the majority of cosmetics are minor altercations to the armour you start with.

2: The actual combat in chiv 2 except for dueling servers boils down to ganging up or being ganged up on by 6 other players. Also the hit boxes are atleast from my experience worse in chiv than Mordhau, so many times have i been killed despite looking at the direction of the attack and even more times i have been killed because despite attacking a while before the enemy the attack is negated and i die.

3. Community is not as appealing, I mean this is just my opinion but i prefer the mordhau community

I would say if you want a ""easier"" learning experience play chiv
if you want better graphics play chiv
if you want epic castles play chiv
if you want a challenging learning curve play mordhau
if you want more customization play mordhau
If you want more realism play mordhau
if you like horde modes play mordhau",1706447556,1706447556,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The SEA players are allocated to asia-east(low ping) and japan(high ping) servers 
but we get allocated into japan servers way more often that asia-east servers. 

This means that we need to keep on leaving and rejoining until an asia-east server appears. 
This is because this game, for some reason, does not have a region selector. Players have been asking for this for many years, but the devs don't give a damn about player experience. 

On top of this, the asia-east servers regularly break. For days, even weeks, some players can experience abnormally high ping in asia-east servers while their connection in the custom servers (HK, SG) still work well. This is happening to me currently for the second time, and it's the third day at this point. The last time it happened to me was about a month ago, which is why I quit the game for a while. 

A PvP-focused game like this having servers like this is an immense problem. The fact that the devs have been completely ignoring this problem doesn't bode well either. 
So please don't buy this terrible game that ignores players who can't play the game because of janky servers. They deserve no support. 



If you're in the NA or EU region where the game's servers are somewhat functional.....
I still do not recommend this game. 

All the animations have way too much overswing.
A longsword looks feels like it has the weight of a tire, and the combat is extremely gimmicky overall with a high skill curve relying exclusively on gimmicks that function like coin tosses thanks to the game's pathetic hit registration.
This makes the combat feel extremely clunky and unsatisfying.

Furthermore, the small yet old playerbase is full of people who played this game a tad bit too much for their own good. Since there is no skill based matchmaking (I don't think there should be one in this game since the playerbase is too small for it), noobs are placed amongst people who have put thousands of hours into this game. Combined with the gimmicky combat, the new player experience can be described as 'atrocious'. 

It is also quite evident that the developers of the game know very little about the weapons used during the medieval era, displayed by the presence of weapons such as:
The DOUBLE HEADED AXES (no practical use, the few that were made were all for ornamental purposes)
The heavy cavalry sword (way past medieval era)
The Italian dueling rapier (also past the medieval era, should be changed to the sidesword or the estoc)
Messers that aren't actually messers (seriously?) 
The two handed hammer (never even existed) 
And weapons that look extremely heavy because they have too much metal on them, whether it be ridiculous langettes or metal shafts. 
It is also disturbing to watch small weapons like daggers being able to easily 'block' large weapons with ease.


Finally, the game should remove the team change feature. This causes massive imbalance in game lobbies and most of the matches I've been in were steamrolls. Since people like to play on the winning team, it often ends up with the very experienced players stacking on one team to curbstomp the noobs.
Instead, they should add a 'preferred faction' option, so that a player can still play on the faction they want to play in while not being able to change team. 

Player-to-dev communication is absolute garbage in this game. Servers aren't being fixed, important QoL changes aren't being implemented, and I don't think this is going to get better anytime soon..





For the past couple of weeks, I've been in contact with a game dev about the server issue. I've sent him lots of server performance reports, hoping that something could be done. The only solution I was given was to contact my internet provider.
This doesn't make any sense. All my other games run with single digit ping, every other server except the asia-east servers have ping I would expect them to. 
Every second I spent in this game was a terrible waste of my time, and I am uninstalling this pathetic excuse for a live service game.

I have reason to suspect the developers have been stalking me since I was a youth collecting data on what I would enjoy in a game. This game brings me back to my childhood adoration of siege engines, knights, and medieval weaponry. It's immersive, detailed, and addicting. The combat system is simple, yet has a high skill ceiling. The sound-design, voice acting, and soundtrack are top notch. When the match nears it's conclusion the music kicks into high gear and just feels cathartic. And last but certainly not least, this game is funny. Even now with hundreds of hours in this game I still find myself in new situations worthy of laughing about. Such as being killed by a giant fish, or a one-armed man with a flaming chicken.

In summation, this is my favorite game. I don't know why I hadn't written a review until now. Because it certainly deserves a positive one from me.

With the time though I have noticed something very unpleasant, not that big of a deal not to recommend the game, but a big con to have in mind. 

There are the so called team switchers, and the devs will probably never do anything about it. But almost always the attackers' team gets filled with higher level players. They usually do that so the games last longer, but what happens is they most of the time turn into a stomp. It's not a fun experience for newer players on the defending team, but its also not fun for everyone (exept the top 5 players) in the attackers' team. Honestly IDK how it is even fun for the top players...

Occasionally you'll get that balanced, epic and very close game. But it's quite rare, most games are stomp/wins for attackers. 

The game still is very fun, there are duel servers, free for all servers etc. Where this does apply so yeah. Give it a try, don't even wait for a sale, Its insanely fun, easy to learn, hard to master slasher.",1705785123,1705785123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However i think Chivalry is like Call of Duty to Mordhau's Counterstrike in terms of the depth of the gameplay. Take what you will from that and dont get me wrong i love chivalry i think its overall more fun but it skill ceiling is much lower in this game.
Mordhau does beat it on the customization point, armour sets are locked in to ""helmet"" and ""armour"" so again lacking the depth that other game has over it.
Im not shitting on either game and i love both of them.
Think of Monty pythons the holy grail if it was a game.

no mini map
some opposing skins are hard to distinguish

no weapon testing areas (it does have practice modes)
no battle music

Chivalry 2 simply isn't Chivalry.  By that I mean it lost its identity and is now just another PvP game.  I immediately noticed the number of work arounds and counters tripled or more.  If memory serves me right in Chivalry 1 attacking drained your stamina not blocking this was switched and I would say for the worse.  Parrying is now an option and if you can parry you can near always win and this leaves your opponent disadvantaged constantly (I know I can't parry so this is a me issue) but it takes away the defenders stamina while keeping yours regenerated for parrying.  Parrying biases aside it doesn't matter if you're good at this game or not cause if you're in a duel usually 3 to 4 people will come over from either team and finish you for an easy kill.  Another work around that kills the fun of Chivalry's combat is it's whoever can get to the edge of your character first usually wins.  I'd bring up the archers but I'd rant instead of review. 

So what is Chivalry 2 honestly I'd have to call it Medieval Battlefield 4 no one really cares about the objective or winning.  I understand to some people that sounds awesome and I can understand that I really didn't have any gripes until my final 3 hours.  However that's not what I came for I came for Chivalry with improved graphics, new weapons, bigger and better maps, better customization.  I'd say I got everything except Chivalry 1 2.0.

I, personally, had a lot of moments of pure joy from interacting with others and seeing with what shenanigans I can get away with. There’re however some outstanding problems, that I believe new players should be aware of.

I will explain the problematic mechanics first before critizing the game.

The combat is timing based, meaning that each attack and each block take up the window of opportunity that your opponent gets or loses, based on your split second decision (in game it is better described as the “initiative”). There’re also jabs and kicks, which stagger the attacking or blocking opponents respectively, making it possible to dictate the rhythm of a fight. The mechanics not only reward patience and game sense in both 1v1 and 1vX situations, but also help to create a chaotic atmosphere of a medieval warfare. The combat is semi-directional, meaning that it DOES matter which way you face your opponent in order to successfully block or land a hit, but it’s not something like, for instance “War of the Roses” did. 

The review is  NEGATIVE, however, due to how the game is currently balanced around player rank and weapons.

Probably the most notable is the balancing issue. The game suffers heavily from teamstacking. Your general Chivalry 2 round will look something like this: the round enters preparation phase, players join and some IMMIDIETLY switch to spectator (mostly high ranked and experienced players). When the lobby is mostly filled, they then join the side that has the highest ranking teammates. As you can probably guess, the game ends with one team almost completely domination the other. There doesn’t seem to be any kind of auto-balance measure either, since quite often teams are unevenly matched. Granted, this doesn’t always happen and some games end up even both in numbers and ranks. This means, however, that Chiv2 lacks any kind of level balancing to prevent this from happening. Because of this, some rounds are completely one sided in spite of the level and objective designs being built around specifically to counter that.

The weapons are divided into one handed and two handed with each class having access to certain loadout combinations and unique skills, only they can use. Each weapon has their respective wind-up time and the release time after which comes the hit. Two handed are (obviously) MUCH slower than one handed, which is compensated by them having greater reach. And, like previously mentioned, since the combat is balanced around timing and reaction, the lobbies are dominated by high ranks using faster one handed weapons like morning stars and warhammers with shields (Edit: which also gain bonus damage when striking with overhead), and ambusher class, which has extremely high attack speed and one hit-kill with throwing knifes. With this meta, two handed weapons are mostly viable ONLY against crowds and [strike] practically unusable [/strike] (Edit) puts you at disadvantage when facing experienced opponent with a knife or star in a 1v1. This wouldn’t have been such an issue, if it wasn’t for the fact, that most one handed weapons have the same if not higher damage than two handed weapons. When taking the balancing issue into consideration, we get lobbies full of 500+ lvl players running around, seeking low-level opponents, switching teams to keep their score and K/D high, while also punishing with frequent jabs and kicks.

This is made worse by how the game treats riposte and counter. Both grant active block (0.5 and 0.4 seconds respectively), which prevents incoming hits and reduces your attack wind up time (which I don’t believe game ever specified). This is however, extremely inconsistent due to either latency, poor hitreg and two handed weapons’ being so slow to swing anyway.

The issues are manageable, meaning that with enough time investment, you will learn how to handle different weapons, when and how to utilize different mechanics available to turn the tide of a fight into your favour. But in order to achieve that, one must go through many rounds of unfair staking, uneven fights and frustratingly inconsistent hit registration to “git gud” in a casual game.

Nevertheless the game is worth playing regardless: there’re many things like interactive level design, fun mission objectives and addicting combat to just give it all up. However, facing opponents may end up being the highlight or the lowest point of the match for you. The game suffers from inconsistences issue, while demanding attention and timing in combat.

Edit: Spaces and wording.

Edit2: Having written this review and after playing some more rounds, I've came to realise that, more ofthen than not,the combat can be very hard to enjoy. On top of the problems I've mentioned before, here are some more that stood out to me: any sense of pace is gone due to how weapons are balanced, jab and kick are practically gamble (don't always connect, different classes with different weapons have varied stagger duration), active block doesn't work sometimes, the game promoting toxic team play behaviours by passively encouraging ganging and mindless spamming, which results in team damage and/or TKs; swings, stabs, overheads are practically indistinguishable in their animations (which is made worse with stabbing only weapons and being able to feint into the same attack types), first person is nigh unplayable regardless of the FOV settings...

In this review I've tried to avoid the topic of cheating since, judging from my personal experience, I've never encountered any blatant cheating. But (and it's a big BUT): the game uses ""EASY ANTICHEAT!!!"" which is just plain unreliable.

If you want to buy this game for some casual fun: I suggest against it due to how often you'll be staring at the respawn camera wondering ""how did that get me?"" or ""what did I do wrong?"" without actually learning anything from the encounter.
If you're looking for a competitive gameplay: I suggest against it, since for the game that is supposed to be based around tight timing and precision, there're too much ""random factor"" in the core mechanics.

TL;DR: The game has strong core and gameplay loop that is addicting and fun to engage with, but unfortunately it suffers from some inconsistent game mechanics based around timing and dodgy hitreg, while also demanding extreme precision. As of now, in order to have fun in MP, one must overcome high ranked players targeting the low ranks and plaguing the training mode, and teamstacking.

I hope that this review was helpful in some way, especially for those who feel the same about the gameplay or is looking to buying it, wanting to know what to expect from it.

[h2] tl;dr [/h2]
Game has stability issues including framerate drops and freezing. Playerbase is strong but toxic, won't play objectives in team game modes, and team stacking is still an issue that takes away any fun in the game. I only recommend Chivalry 2 if you turn your brain off and play like a zombie swinging a sword. Otherwise, if you are looking for a team-based medieval slasher, Chivalry 2 will only satisfy that thirst during a minuscule of time spent on it. This game is mostly a massive waste of time.

[h2] Overall Review[/h2]
Chivalry 2 is sometimes incredibly addicting, with teams working together toward objectives and the attacks/blocks appear to register accurately. However, it feels that lately the quality has gone down a lot. The game still suffers from server issues where I'll be disconnected randomly or I'll experience frame rate drops and sometimes temporary game freeze. For a game that's been out for years, I'd expect better performance at this point. The game also has pretty bad landscape design. Minor props that you would expect the player character to walk over instead just stops moving immediately, sometimes leading to getting killed. It's incredibly frustrating to being in a fast pace fight only to have your character stop all of the sudden because a small box is randomly placed in the fighting area. Each player model has what appears to be 3 foot long bubble, which makes group fights absolute hell since everyone is just constantly blocking each other. I can't recall the amount of times I was screwed because a player just stood there blocking my dodge from an attack. If you turn off your brain and just swing, the game can be pretty fun. However, if you are more analytical, you can't unsee the flaws in this game and that will certainly affect your satisfaction.

Also, the community has become much more toxic. It's not uncommon to find the chat being filled with slurs and people talking about conspiracy theories. The vote kick system is pretty flawed since it requires over half the players to vote yes to succeed when most players don't even vote. There aren't any admins on the server, so you're pretty much stuck with what's there. In terms of gameplay, if I jump on a catapult/ballista that someone else wants to jump on, instead of asking or just moving on they will just start to attack me to team kill me. I'll start a vote kick and sometimes they get kicked. Most offenders don't get kicked since, again, the voting system in the game is cranked and that player will continue to be a nuisance.

I have also noticed that less players are playing the objective. I love team-based games where teams have to overcome objectives to win. That usually requires people actively working together and thinking about the next step. With this game being team oriented unless you play duel or FFA, there are objectives to win or lose. In my experience, most players don't even try to play the objectives. Most will just 1v1 in large groups without ever being close to the objective. I'll never understand why players won't go to other game modes if they won't play as a team.

Teamstacking is probably the worst part of the game. Some players may say that teams don't matter, but try playing this game when the other team has the most experienced players in the game. The game just becomes a steamroll fest, whether you play the objective or not and is ridiculously unfun. Most servers have this problem, with better ranked players flocking to the other team to steam roll, while the original team is stuck with noobs and casuals who eventually leave to find other servers. When I notice team stacking I immediately leave because I know I won't have fun. If I join a separate server I am greeted with the same exact problem. It amazes me that the developers have been completely silent about this issue. This is the final straw for me since it makes the game completely unplayable.

This game is fun and ridiculous at the same time. It takes time and patience to learn the mechanics, and the initial stages of progressing are actually fun. However, after a couple hundred hours and at a rank of 123, I don't find myself enjoying this game anymore. A lot of the gameplay is wasted finding a server that was not teamstacked as well as not full of toxic nerds, and when I find the one good match I keep playing only to go on the search for that desired good match again.",1705131115,1705131322,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons:

It got somehow even worse with new animation bugs where enemies hit you way out of the weapon range or the animation starts at the end of the swing and they block all attack towards their back. The enemy hitboxes with faster weapons are practically toothpicks combined with the laggynes, obvious hits miss. Your jump cooldown is too long and is very random. Projectile trails make no sence and are wrong. 
BOTH TEAMS spawn way too far away from the objective and have to walk 20 seconds to get to it every time you die and then there are also the horrible respawn times. Just let both teams spawn closer so I don`t have to contemplate my life choices which led me to play this pile of diarrhea. 
The counter still doesn`t fucking work 1/3 times and the active time after a counter is gone. You can`t block for no fucking reason randomly for up to 3 seconds and when the shield symbol is clearly on screen before a strike hits you, you still get hit AND THEN THE GAME SHOWS YOU THAT THE BLOCK FAILED and your imputs generaly can just not come.
The same goes with kicking and the timeframe you need to stop blocking is completely random and you get broken long after you already attacked. Just make it consistent and add fitting UI. The last part isn`t the worst but these are BASIC COMBAT FUNCTIONS AND YOU ADD A USELESS WEPON AND A SHORT MAP INSTEAD OF FIXING THEM. How the fuck can`t you fix the perfect base game and somehow even make it worse.
For a wanting to murder someone any% speedrun play dagger for your 3 successful hits and counters per match.

I put in some healthy 400+ hours into Chivalry, Mordhau, and now Chivalry 2-- I play Team Objective because it's what I enjoy. Duel and FFA servers are not my flavor. I like my slashers goofy at times-- I think C2 and Mordhau allowed for that. I believe that people who clamor for removal of ""for fun"" game play items, should stick to the duel or modified community servers.

Chivalry 2 has vastly improved the system in its predecessor Chivalry Medieval Warfare. Wide arc swings with polearms are viable but there are no more ""helicopter attacks"" while aiming at the sky and twirling like a figure skater. 

Comparing to Mordhau, the combat system is more simplified which is a genuine blessing. The frames in which you can block/parry are longer and combat in C2 relies more on positioning, strategy, and speed. I felt as though Mordhau suffered from LMB spamming with Executioners' Sword. To sum up C2 combat, you can:
- Fast Attack- Swing, Overhead, or Thrust
- Heavy Attack- Swing, Overhead, or Thrust
- Alternate Swing (Change direction of swing)
- Special Attack (Weapon Specific)
- Sprint Attack
- Kick
- Jab
- Attacks can be canceled for a feint.
- Feints can be morphed into a different attack type.
- Blocks can held but drain stamina. Kicks stagger blocking opponents.
- A riposte is performed by attacking quickly after a successful block. This will create a 0.5 second autoparry window that blocks incoming attacks in front of the player while performing the attack. This allows players to fight multiple opponents if they can riposte or counter the first incoming attack. This does nothing for players who are surrounded-- positioning is key.
- Counters can be performed by matching an incoming attack while blocking it. A counter negates stamina use of the block and also create a 0.5 second period of autoparry that negates stamina use (unlike the riposte). This 0.5 second period window can be extended by blocking any additional attacks and allow for consecutive counters. The follow-up attack after a counter is accelerated. It can also be feinted/morphed.

Game runs with no performance loss on an RTX 3060. Some levels have a greater resource need. Update your drivers and/or turn down your settings.",1704647857,1704647857,True,1,0,0.503287076950073242,0,True,False,False

While the fighting system can be difficult to get used to, I find that it is intuitive after a bit of practice. There are 4 fighter classes to choose from, each with a few weapons only found within that class, as well as weapons that are shared across classes. This allows players to find the fighting class that works best for their skills and preferences. The melee attacks have an interesting flow, with a wide swing, a downward swing, and a stab motion, as well as a heavy attack and pommel strikes. 
The game has multiple maps that are well made and have details that the average player may not care about, but makes the game charming, for what it is. There is also an immense catalog for weapon skins, character skins, heraldry, armor, and more. Most skins come with leveling up, so the serotonin from getting gifts continues throughout playing the game.
Lately there has been lagging issues, which is making game play more annoying, so hopefully they fix that soon. There can also be problems with players being hateful and aggressive, but the community is typically pretty good at telling the offenders that they are not welcome. I have found many more friends during battles than foes, and as long as devs keep weeding out the problem players, this Chivalry II will stay in my Top 5 list.",1704160943,1704160943,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But I have a friend who loves to play, otherwise I would have shelved it a while ago

Because no game should have the optimal strategy of becoming a crouching driedel. More spinning men than the skating Olympics makes this game essentially medieval idiots on ice.

In the end, everyone playing squatting frogman makes it appear as though the battlefield is populated by dysentery-ridden imbeciles. Fitting, I suppose, but defiantly not what I had in mind for my medieval fighting game.

Should you decide that this experience sounds right for you, be sure to pick the Highland Sword or Greatsword for maximum gain/douchebaggery. No other weapon matters.

Forgot to mention: for some reason this medieval battlefield has more napalm than Vietnam, so be ready for that.

When Chivalry 1 came out I remember playing it and having a lot of fun with what essentially is a medieval call of duty that required more skill than just point click and swinging you're weapon. It was by no means perfect and it had some flaws but overall it was a fun experience. When I saw they we're making a Chivalry 2 I was excited to buy it to relive that experience again but in a sequel fashion. But after my many playthroughs I sadly can't call it anything but a disappointment. This is not to say that Chivalry 2, on it's own, is a bad game. I actually played it for well over 200+ hours and had a lot of fun. However, the review question specifically asks me whether or not I would recommend it to other players. Sadly, unless you are a huge Chivalry fan, I cannot. 

As mentioned before the keyword is 'neglect'. It's what happens when you make a great videogame but fail to keep it up in an orderly fashion to avoid it falling off the cliff. While I understand the developers are very short staffed there are still many flaws that have absolutely no excuses or should have been fixed a much before they were. Team balance is broken. Certain maps double you're respawn time. Many of these issues have yet to be fixed and the only thing the developers have done is one new update that seemed to create even more issues than it fixed. As for the next update? It was supposed to come out in August and now it's been delayed to October. Because of the lack of new content, bug fixes, and updates the player numbers started to drop. As a result, the only people left are those who are highly skilled. Once you reach this stage it is nearly impossible to come back from it unless you have a lot to offer in return and these developers sadly do not. Perhaps their expectation was that the hype would last long enough that they could take major breaks between adding new content but that backfired completely. After you play the game long enough you begin to notice the issues that were once barely noticeable because you've basically experienced all stuff it has to offer. 

The overall point is that when you make a good game of this scale you can't just abandon it and hope people will stick around without asking questions. Torn Banner sadly became developer equivalent to the Dad who went out for milk one night and never returned home. The lack of new content, lack of updates, existing bugs, and dwindling player numbers do not paint a good future for Chivalry 2 and for that reason I can't recommend buying it right now. Hopefully one day the developers will prove me wrong. That being said, if you really love Chivalry or still want to buy it anyway wait for it to go on sale. Do NOT buy it at full price. 

I give this game a 2/5.

*REVIEW UPDATE AS OF 11/25/2023*

After having uninstalled the game the developers finally released the new ""Reclamation"" update in November; nearly two and a half months after it was supposed to come out. To give a fair shake I decided to reinstall it and see if this update was any good or if there were any improvements. The update itself is lackluster to say the least. The new weapon, the siege crossbow, serves a very limit purpose and overall kinda sucks. As for the map, it is much better compared to the last one and is actually fun to play but is incredibly slanted towards offense. Also, the new map is not in the regular map rotation so the only way to play it is in a public 40 player server list and hope you get lucky running into it. Absolutely NOBODY plays these gamemodes at the main menu. The new gamemode ""Last Peasant Standing"" was something I was super excited for and yet it is nowhere to be found which is a HUGE letdown. Even after a huge delay the developers still managed to only put out the bare minimum. So my review has not changed. I still cannot recommend this game until the devs decide they actually decide to put in effort and make it better.

LIST OF EXISTING BUGS AND PROBLEMS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS REVIEW
-Respawn time is doubled in certain gamemodes and maps for no reason at all
-Weapons on players and playermodels are sometimes invisible which cause confusion in combat
-The ""desertion"" mechanic is broken and punishes players who survive past the objective by forcing them to move and if they are not quick enough autokills them
-Horse mechanics are incredibly buggy; it is easy to get stuck and there are delays in movement it just simply isn't finished yet
-Newer maps such as Stronghold, Montcrux, and Bridgetown have serious performance issues causing frames to drop

The gameplay would otherwise be fun, the graphics are nice, quite the variety of map interactions

The ""skillgap"" between players is HORRENDOUS , just like in Mordhau, there's two goddamn players with a higher score/kda than the entire server combined . I say ""skillgap"" because I am pretty sure that is more cheating than skill...

It gets to the point where you couldn't even tell if someone is actually a skilled player or hacking, because of the way they move around and hit 
Quite often did I see a few players where I thought ""There is NO WAY a human being can move this fast"" 
I say hacking because invidual ""duel servers"" are mostly just players using flyhack , imagine what else they can get away with ?!

I'll give it this, Unlike Mordhau this game actually tries to explain the controls and a mob surrounding a high level player can actually win, instead of him swooping and walking away with full health , NOT HAVING the simple thing of GAINING HEALTH ON KILL made this game greatly more enjoyable I'll give it that , good job Torn Banner

I've largely backed out of playing most multiplayer-only games at this point as I've personally found more satisfaction elsewhere, however, Chivalry 2 has rightly sold me on this one. I will hack, thrust, and slash my way through an entire late night and not even realize the time that has slipped by.

I've always heard the phrase ""Don't be a hero"" get thrown around in real life - cautioning others at the risk they may be putting themselves in. Not in Chivalry II lmao. This game brings out the hero in everyone. A whole team of Leeroy Jankins game after game and I wouldn't have it any other way! There’s never a dull moment, no matter your skill level.

One complaint I had with the original Chivalry was my inability to competently grasp the controls. That has not been the case here. Seems like they are more natural and flow well. Seems like whatever was needing tweaking has had the right touch! I do wish they'd ease up on the cosmetic store prices. Seems like a lot of in-game play to earn much currency.

This is a slap in the face to the kickstarter contributers that made this all possible.

On top of that, the weapon and class balance is terrible, Vanguard is the best by a mile and the other combat classes are just food to axes and mauls. I would not recommend giving these devs anymore money.

- hit registration is broken - basically you are playing lottery game, wondering if your or your enemies attacks are going to hit or not, 
- many weapons are broken/OP - for example: messer hit range is longer than its model 
- optimization is nowhere to be found (since last patch, on my potato pc i've been hitting 20-25 fps, before it was comfortably sitting in around 50)
- servers are crashing every day
- constant ""lost connection to host"", ""lost connection to server"" errors
- a lot of bugs spawning you under map, or not letting you spawn at all + last patch reintroduced bug that was fixed for sometime that spawns your character, but you are locked in free cam, with only fix to this is leaving server
- a lot of cheaters that are not getting banned at all
- match making is HORRIBLE, and high level players constantly abuse team switching, to get into better team, shitting on non existing balance even more
- there is absolutelly no balance on maps, you are either attacking, or you are getting fucked by attackers - attackers have faster spawns, better placement of said spawns, easier objectives (some of those defending team never wins) etc. only thing that defenders have is - on some maps last objective can sometimes be won if you have a good player at top spot
- last 2 points are making 90%-95% rounds, one team (mostly attack) completelly dominating the game
- a lot of toxic players (and i mean ALOT), and the only thing you can do is mute them for ONE! round
- new patches breaking things that was working (example - gate on rudhelm not opening any more)

In conclusion, it is really sad and frustrating to see this once fun and exciting game to play, in this sorry state, abandoned by devs.",1703270944,1703270944,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I've never seen people swing the heaviest weapons imaginable in the game like they are toothpicks so much in my life. It definitely doesn't help how people who are outright worse than you are doing the most trash talk and there's no easy way to report them. Not like they'll get punished for it anyway. 

I've encountered a severe amount of one shot hacks being used as well. I'm running around as a Knight - the tankier class - getting one shot by a knife, sword or insta dying to fire pots while I'm at full health and the fire damage comes up as ""4 damage"". Implying I only had 4 HP at full health. Let's not forget, if you try calling out cheaters, you signed your own death warrant with everybody because they will immediately dogpile on you in chat and votekick spam you. 

I've also encountered infinite health hacks being used by a lot of people as well as infinite stamina and infinite weapon durability. When you have one guy surrounded by 6 people wailing on them and not only are they not dying, but they're constantly blocking with their weapon, not even parrying or doing any kind of evading. Then they take a single swing start one shotting everybody.

I've encountered teleportation hacks that allow people to appear wherever they want, whenever they want. I had this happen in an AI match no less to end off a night of doing 64 man team objective. The game loves to respawn you half way across the planet, so it's incredibly unrealistic to compete objectives in some portions of maps. Me and 2 others noticed another player on the other team teleport into existence, conveniently in the exact spot needed to compete taking over a bridge and proceeded to clear 7 of us on the point like it was nothing. One shot, infinite stamina and health. 

I've encountered countless people that run through several oil pots and never ignite or lose health and they will even stand in the fire and take no damage and proceed to one shot your 130+ health class with a 70 damage non-heavy attack while you're at full health. 

I've encountered more people that phase through my maul swings. I see my maul physically go through someone's torso. Completely missing them and that same person one shots me with a dagger or a polearm while I'm at full health. People are hitting me through my block. People are 360 auto-blocking. I once had 6 people surrounding one guy and he was blocking everywhere around him and proceeded to start one shotting more than half the people in the group surrounding him before we managed to take him down with a lucky hit (or he turned the hacks off long enough to allow himself to die to try and make it look like he wasn't cheating). 

The devs care more about monetization than the game's playerbase and overall stability with bugs affecting crossbows, making it so you're incapable of aiming if you get attacked by a projectile at the same time as you're bringing your bow up, or people glitching into the geometry and spasing out, unable to move or defend themself and the game just outright spawning you inside of nothing and you're stuck in place until the game lets you suicide. Just to list a couple severe issues that prevent you from playing the game.

This is the second time in a row they took a game with huge potential and ruined it miserably with sheer neglect. It's absurd how little the devs care about this game. It's appalling. This game doesn't remotely deserve it's positive status. Steam reviews are a cancer. If something isn't reported on from a website or a YouTuber with a mass following, nothing gets done and games get reviews they don't deserve. 

They can't be bothered to fix their game and they can't be bothered to enforce anti cheat measures or reports and continue to cultivate one of the worst atmospheres in competitive gaming. Let alone the fact that people can straight up curse you out, sabotage you and your team, say racist things (except for the n word, because Torn Banner thinks there's only a single racist word in the world.) and overall, treat you in the worst ways that would make CoD MW2 Xbox lobbies blush. 

I witnessed someone on my team yell at everybody saying someone posted CP links in chat and then started a votekick against them, expecting to get them kicked then went into all chat telling people that the guy needs therapy. That person who got votekicked did no such thing. A retaliation votekick happened and there was a couple votes needed to kick the guy out. The fact you need a near unanimous agreement is a garbage feature. TB is protecting these kinds of people and letting them run rampant. Reporting them for their behavior doesn't work either. TB straight up doesn't care. It was on a 64 Team Objective lobby and the guy got over 20 yes votes to kick but 6 trolls in the team wanted to hit no to make the votekick fail.  

Any kind of call out for toxicity, cheating, hacking or criticism of the game is met with ""git gud"", ""skill issue"", ""mad cuz bad"" and whatever other variation of brain dead responses you can think of. Don't believe the ""Very Positive"" review score. The reviews are mostly made up of memes and people thumbs upping and saying one word or one sentence. This game is genuine trash and TB has lost all respect, credibility and doesn't deserve your time or money. They only care about battle passes and micro-transactions and people whose mentalities align with theirs. The reason they get away with this is because they have no real competition and what little competition they DO have is either shutting down or equally as garbage in quality and community.",1702320154,1703139833,False,2,0,0.510460257530212402,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I won't draw comparisons to other games, but playing this I can't help but feel a lot of the combat was given severe oversight into how it should function. (I should note I have well over 1000+ hours in other slashers and melee-focused fighting games. Not that all games in the genre should be exactly the same nor play the same.)

The blocking mechanics feel so clunky more than half the time and hits feel more like a game of chance rather that proper mechanical application, I'm not super fond of the generalized block based on  your viewmodel nor the very strange parry system, I almost feel reflexive blocking would have fared better than something that's a generalized hitbox. The movement is strange and feels strange, especially the dodging aspect of things.  For a melee slasher, it feels as if the melee side of things was not properly thought out or planned and they settled for something more simple rather than tuning it properly.

Game was also only released because of Mordhau's bombing steam reviews, as if they'd somehow steal the playerbase from that small game to this (honestly) worse game than Mordhau. At least Mordhau has reflexive blocking and parrying that makes sense, this game has some of the worst combat logic and design I've seen in a game in a long time. 

I was excited for this game coming from other slasher prospects as I enjoyed the first all those years ago, but I can't quite recommend this one, it feels like it lacks a lot of love and a lot of proper critical thinking from a development point of view. The passion just isn't there, and for that reason, I can't quite recommend it to anyone who considers them self a fan of the genre as a whole.",1694292652,1702782377,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

But let me layout as plain as I physically can - Thayric is singlehandedly the worst fucking map I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing.  I am utterly convinced Torn Banner pulled a poll of the most disdained features shoved that shit into a blender and poured it down the coders' throats.  I have a 3070, and Thayric on low settings, across the board, pulls 12 frames.

12/13 - Recent developments had ushered me back to edit this review with an additional tidbit. I would further discourage you from buying this game as the developers themselves are now engaging in hacking in lobbies too have fun on their own game. I'm sure we've all heard of the deplorable Mr Weenie, recent screencaps from ingame encounters had shown members from TornBanners' own team are engaging in activities like, aside Weenie. This is important, as this can be no more blatant a show of disregard. Those who have the game are screwed, they have our money and no intent on making the game notable or fun, excluding for their own sessions of course. Buy Mordhau if you want a melee fighter, or Bannerlord. This mess is malignant at best.


As they've recently removed all horses from all maps, locking them behind the mode specifically for them, the amount of fun i've been able to have has dramatically dipped.

It's memorable when you can go on an absolute rampage because you got lucky and timed everything, than get killed mercilessly 5x in a row. I'm having fun with no skills, and am getting better noticeably quick. But its not impossible to slay mad people in a round as a beginner if you have half a brain.
 
Most upgrades are cosmetic, so no getting overwhelmed if you aren't level 3958. Just have fun.

Graphics are great (rtx 4070), controls are good and smooth.

Guess I can say more, but its surely worth the purchase esp. If on sale. 

I recommend trying the 2h hammers and Smashing people around a touch.
Can't wait to try the archery and bow shooting rigamarole.

-All maps are attacker sided (by a large margin) causing mass team switching and no there is no effective auto balance system to fix this. Since I myself refuse to abuse the team swapping I find myself playing defence non stop because the attacking teams are always full.

-Game modes like team deathmatch are fun but you can't matchmake for such gamemodes outside of manual joining 3rd party servers, and I'm fairly sure third party servers cant host pure TDM even if they wanted to. 
Honestly some TDM servers would probably all I need to make this review positive.

-group matchmaking is general broken and a lacks basic features like leaving a server with your group.

There's some areas to improve for sure...

- You can't just ""join"" your friends if they are mid-round, unless they've chosen a server from the browser
- Like any other game without matchmaking the round can snowball and you'll get steamrolled, or you'll be doing the steamrolling.
- Some maps specific objectives are designed.... poorly... either too easy, or too difficult to defend or attack.
- Respawn timer is obnoxiously long sometimes since you pop out in waves you'll miss the wave and be waiting for 12-15 seconds sometimes, and 1-2 other times.
- Respawn locations can be annoyingly far away... see poorly refined objectives.
- We really shouldn't be having skins that are difficult to identify, Yellow vs Red makes this even worse, as does being burnt or covered in blood - some skins seem intentionally designed to have as little colour on them as possible.

Yet in spite of all this every time I hop on I have fun, I learn a bit more and I have a good time, I'm not the best, but I hold my own and in a small group you can have an absolute impact on the dynamic of the game, especially if the rest of the server is sleeping on objectives.

the reason I don't recommend this game is the community. every time the yellow team (some vague eastern culture) is the enemy the chat is ""sand ni****s don't read! lets burn their stolen books!"" or some other racist crap. it's incredibly toxic and you can turn off the text chat but it's a team game so that's not very beneficial for you to do. it's common place for players to go back and fourth calling each other names and being incredibly obnoxious and hostile.

I was a bit hesitant on getting this game. Played Chivalry 1 in the past and had fun times with it. I bought this game about a 1-2 years after release. Gotta say it's a fun experience... Like you can hop on and play for 15min and have fun, or play for 2hrs and will still have a fun satisfying experience. 

This is a fighting game at it's core. You can button mash, but it's best to learn the cadences/combos. You can ride on horses, use enemy ballistas/siege weapons, and decapitating body parts always satisfying. The chaos in large battles is to be admired which comes with unique objectives. They have group 3v3, and your traditional 1v1. There is a tutorial and bot-only modes for practice.

Poor ranking/matchmaking filters leading to missed opportunities in E-sports. There can be lag at times like some reviews have mentioned, however it wasn't too overbearing. I have only ran this game on WiFi so.. 

You can customize your units, voices, gender, etc. However don't expect anything as detailed as The Sims. There is incentive to play longer and unlock new skins. DLC and seasonal updates seem to keep content fresh. However there isn't enough initiatives in their competitive space.

Missed naval combat scenarios? Potentially in a sequel.

Torn Banner really fumbled the bag on this one and lost so much potential in this game. Best thing they could do now is permanently drop the price, allow private servers, and let the modding community take over. Mods will create new life in this dead boi, Helm's Deep with Chivalry 2 combat, imagine! Ranked servers, new player friendly servers, etc. 

As of now the new player experience* is to skip the tutorial and join 64 player team objective (against players with 100s-1000s of hours played) where you go 2-20 KD every game for a few hours then uninstall. I love this game, and I hate seeing players have such a terrible experience and quit without fully unlocking the potential to have fun, because once you have full control over your game, the opportunities to have fun are endless. But I also know a lot of OG players who have quit (and I miss them, dearly).
This game is a sandbox for creativity and fun, all the templates are there, the mechanics are there, it just needs to have it's gate open by the devs. Give us private servers and mod support and you'll see a second wind in this gem whose potential is being stunted. 

*Perfect example is this free to play weekend (12/9/23), every time it's on sale or free to play - dormant toxic level 800-1000s come back and stomp the new players.

I saw 2 cheaters in 2 years and i played 100s of games. Griefing, yes like in all the games, outright cheaters, 2 in 200+ hrs. I saw more in Battlefield and more in StarWars Battlefield.

As for the lvl difference, its purely cosmetic. you dont get skill points or more power, you unlock weapons along the way, but hey if you couldnt theyd complain about  no content.

When i took a step back and started to analyze things i found every death had its reason, it was all traceable, every time i found my own mistake. now that is not a mindset for most people but it should.

If you do happen to randomly join a match & team you want to play on, there's a good chance you'll get auto-team switched midway through - which also ruins the game.

Apparently the devs think that giving players absolutely no choice makes it 'balanced & fun', when in reality it just means you'll rarely ever get a full game on a map & team you want and so it's mostly just annoying, boring, and match results & all stats are utterly meaningless as a result.
(who cares if that random team you didn't want to join, loses on that random map you didn't want to play on)

Most of my 'game time' is leaving it idle while doing other things, looking sometimes to see if it'll ever join a map & team I want. 
There's no point trying to find another match after it's randomly joined you into one because most of the time it just rejoins you back into the same match you've already left, which just wastes more time.

I once wanted a single match on Lionspire map as Attackers from the start -  There are only a few maps & 2 teams but I had to leave the game idle for about 8 hours before I was able to play that 1 short game.

The combat is satisfying and intuitive and the overall flow of the game is fun and fast-paced. Most of the maps are fun and engaging. The interactions you have in-game can be funny. Sadly that's where the positives end.

The community is divided with Torn Banner releasing sparse updates each year (around 2-3 updates if we're lucky) and each update doesn't offer much content, maybe a weapon or two or a map but that's about it. The battle passes are pitiful with only 40 levels each which can be completed in a matter of days. Team balance is FUBAR and some maps favour either attackers or defenders so you will often get steam rolled. There's no ranked mode so comp is pretty much dead aside for clans on Discord who host private duel servers. 

That being said, this game is a lot of fun for fans of melee games like Mordhau, Chiv 1, Mount & Blade etc. but there is a good chance that new players to the genre may get turned off by some of the mechanics and general bs of the game. Would recommend checking out tho.

Read this before purchasing the game.

After more than 100 hours in this game, I have something to say. I have never written negative reviews about games, but this time it's just the height of absurdity in every damn parameter.

Let's start with the main issue:
The developers couldn't care less about their own product; the release of buggy patches happens constantly. Take the latest one, 2.9, for example. I want to point out that in this ""magnificent masterpiece"" of indifference, patches come out once every !!!six!!! months, assuming the development team hasn't gone crazy on cocaine. !ATTENTION, ONCE ONLY IN SIX F***ING MONTHS! They added only new, broken weapons that don't correspond to their characteristics. They simply repurposed an existing crossbow into the new weapon and didn't test its feature, which it was supposed to have.

The new maps are just super unoptimized piece of shit that will lag even with the necessary gaming requirements. As a result, you will lose more often, even if you have skill.

And the main thing: it has an extremely toxic and inadequate gaming community that will harass you for any mistake. 
This is especially evident on 1v1 servers, where logically you should be fighting one opponent, but at a crucial moment, another player will sneak up behind you and kill you. Not to mention the insane number of irrational idiots in team objective matches who knowingly kill their own team with catapults and ballistae.

In general, if the desire to purchase this crap for $5 or more still hasn't faded away, my condolences. 
I won't set foot in this dumpster again, n wish the same for you.",1701715899,1701715899,False,0,1,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

there is no skill based match making, no effective auto balance and no enforced scramble.

you will be farmed, on repeat by level 1ks who stack on single teams and roll the lobby while every time this miserable game goes on sale its flooded with brand new players who simply dont know whats going on, half your team going 0/20 while the top 15 players on the enemy team are in triple digit kills.

it dosent matter how good you are if 2/3s of your team are rank 0-50 and you are constantly left completely swarmed as your team couldent kill themselfs faster unless they were spamming f10 off spawn.

i like chiv alot but i cant put up with this system anymore. i can deal with players just being better then me, i cannot put up with my own team acting like bots and being such a hindrance that i cannot play the game.

Weapons are all over the place. 
Don't always hit your targets even with a battle axe. 
They boot you from your team 75% way through the game to the losing team. Auto Team Balancing.... Why??
Let the game play out. 
The overabundance of items can be a lot and the ui does no favours. 
The maps are okay, they're beautiful but there is no front line most of the time. When there is you feel like a wall and you must join in or lose. It's a great feeling fro a medieval pvp game. 

Chivalry 2 is fun, it feels sluggish now unfortunately. 

Also randomly had a bug where my entire screen went black but I could still open the menu and hear the battle near me. I was blind in game and walking into the sound of swords clashing to find a means to an end.

Teammates that down me in the middle of the fight of my life by swinging right into my back, missing the enemy, and then dying after killing me.  

However, this game also has given me some crazy good moments.  Winning 5V1s, holding the line with a group of randoms, storming passed dug-in defenders, winning amazing duels, and butchering gangs of Mason dogs for the glory of Agatha.  The drip is top-notch (except for Tenosia), battlecries are awesome, and its overall a good time. 

However again, there are many glitches, bugs, stutters, etc.  Torn Banner also seems to break the game after every update, with hit reg (among other things) getting bad and staying broken for a while.  Still, I love this game.  I am level 170 on PS5 and level 130 here on PC, my new home for Chiv.

There is no counter to Engineers.

The siege crossbow is bugged, dealing no damage to buildings (It wouldn't matter regardless, based on where Engi walls are placed per map. That and; other players + terrain + layout means they can't hit anyway)

Equaliser weapons exist, making the Armour / HP of Knight and Footman entirely useless. (Blunt / Axe weapons)

Meta weapons are ungodly strong compared to others, if they where used more the game would suck: Dane Axe, War Club, Pole Hammer (Special can 1 shot footman with a head-hit btw), Warhammer and Highlander (If you know how to animation exploit / time crouch spam, it's not hard), War Bow, Greatsword, Mace / Morning Star.

Interactions with fellow players be it your team mates or the enemy can be hilarious at times, it's also one of those games where combat can absolutely boil your piss one moment (Archers!), and then in the next have you howling with laughter when vengeance is served.

To start with find a class you like and really stick with it, combat swing/parry/duck/counter timing is everything, just swinging wildly will get you no where other than dead. Classes are varied, and you unlock weapons etc via in-game rank/currency earned through combat. Maps range from large to small and vary greatly. 

Maximum player count is 64, chat spam's auto blocked, and servers feature a vote kick system which is not easily abused. You can party up with Steam friends, and game features cross play so you can enjoy battering the console plebs, although the majority still seem to be PC players.

Big negative is the lack of in game voice mic communication support, so good job the character voice emote wheels are expansive and often funny to use in the given moment. Can always use discord, but for those not in your group; once you learn the voice lines for each class it becomes easy to get across what you want to convey to others around you.

Just want to voice how I'm disappointed with the direction of where the game is going.

-THE MAPS-
While game has a _ton_ of maps, you'll play like 5.
For some reason certain maps are just exclusive to one 64 player queue, which offers more hectic / less controlled gamplay (tl;dr - too much zerg)

-THE UPDATES-
previous 3 updates brought issues one after the other:
1. straight out broken map (Winter assault), with below 30 fps for even high-end PCs (took months to fix)
2. map that looked ugly af with either lowres textures or texture loading issues? (it still does look ugly)
3. and then the last one - Reclamation update brought map with 1/3rd of  content/playtime.

All issues are constantly brought up, there is a communication with community/playtests, but at the end of the day it feels like nothing changes.

-THE MOD SUPPORT-
This was talked about, before the release of the game. Chiv 1 lived so long not because it had 100 maps, but because modders made dosens of maps and gamemodes. Some maps even became part of the official queue.

TL;DR
This game gets 2-3 maps per year, with performance issues that take months to fix.
It just not enough variaion for a long-term enjoyment

One guy harrasses you in the game and others just prefer to watch it. It doesnt happen once, twice, but countless times. Not to me but many other people. Even I have run into scenarios where the harrasser wasn't kicked, and the harassed guy was kicked. There is literally no reason. As long as you don't run into these arseholes, you won't be having any problem. But if you do, like thousands of players, it will possibly put you in a position you will question ""is it really worth playing?"" And the answer is NO.

Besides that, you'll find yourself struggling to even hit the enemy as all of your teammates have a magnet implanted in their brain that attracts their big fucking heads to the tip of your weapon, so that every time you swing they cock-block your attack and then immediately die after, leaving you to fend off the entire opposing army while they all focus on a single dude 800 miles from the objective. Love the kicking mechanic and it's totally not abused as 3+ people kick after every stupid goddamn attack they do and it breaks your block every time and drains all your stamina. Light weapon spam is always fun to deal with as you have a gang of little shield dweebs all spamming rmb like it's the only button they remember from the fucking tutorial. It's basically impossible to win on the defending team for most maps, and the smartest players almost always immediately spam the team switch (which works 0% of the time) so that they don't spend 30 minutes being gang banged by 30+ people at once. Joining any lobby will most likely automatically put you on the losing team for you to experience all of this, so you're better off standing in spawn and waiting for the teams to reconfigure for the next map. Almost no-one plays on the objective and would rather just go for kills, so it's extremely easy to bait the opposite team away from the objective for a couple of minutes to get an ez win. If you do end up deciding to play and end up outperforming the computers powered by hamsters running on wheels, aka your teammates, you'll end up being switched to the other team anyways for ""re-balancing""

[i]Chivalry 2 brought me back to the days of my fascination with medieval history. The clang of swords, the rush of charging into battle – it's all here. [/i]

[h1][b] 📝Story/Plot without spoilers:[/b][/h1]
[table][tr][td] 🔸 Chivalry 2 doesn't have a traditional narrative, but it's set in a fictional medieval world where two factions, the Agatha Knights and the Mason Order, are locked in a perpetual war. The game's focus is on delivering an authentic medieval warfare experience, where each battle tells its own story of bravery, strategy, and, of course, chaos.
[/td][/tr][/table]

[h1][b]🎮Gameplay:[/b][/h1]
[table][tr][td] 🔸 Chivalry 2 is not just a game; it's a plunge into the heart of medieval warfare. The combat system is a complex dance of strikes, blocks, and feints, requiring both skill and strategy. Players can choose from a range of classes, each with its own unique weapons and playstyles. Whether you're wielding a massive two-handed sword as a Knight or picking off enemies from a distance as an Archer, the game offers a diverse combat experience.

------🔹 The real thrill of Chivalry 2 lies in its large-scale battles. These 64-player skirmishes are chaotic, intense, and utterly captivating. You'll find yourself storming castles, laying siege to fortresses, and engaging in brutal melee combat. The game's objective-based modes add a layer of strategy, where you're not just fighting for kills but also working with your team to achieve specific goals.

------🔹 The combat mechanics are deep and nuanced. Timing and precision are key, as is understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your chosen class and weapons. The game rewards skillful play, and there's a real sense of progression as you learn to parry effectively, time your counter-attacks, and use the environment to your advantage.

------🔹 Chivalry 2 also excels in its attention to detail. The battlefields are dynamic, with destructible environments and interactive elements that can turn the tide of battle. Siege weapons like catapults and ballistae add another layer of depth, allowing for devastating attacks but requiring coordination and protection.

------🔹 The game's combat is brutal and unforgiving, but also exhilarating. The satisfaction of landing a well-timed strike or successfully leading a charge against overwhelming odds is unmatched. The game also injects a sense of humor and absurdity into the proceedings, with over-the-top voice lines and scenarios that lighten the mood amidst the carnage.

------🔹 For those looking to refine their skills, the game offers a tutorial and practice modes. These are invaluable resources for newcomers, as they provide a safe space to get to grips with the game's mechanics without the pressure of real combat.

Horses suck. Keep them out of the game! You can't even hear them coming. They just kill you out of nowhere with no forewarning. So they suck! Thank you!

Remove the horses.

Holy crap! They actually removed the terrible horses. Thank you!!

You earned this thumbs up!

I still would not recommend this game to Chivalry 1 players, UNLESS you are simply totally desperate to fill the slasher niche (the reason I have been playing). Why do I say that? Well, there is always Mordhau, but Mordhau's maps and the domination game type are simply dry. Chivalry 2 does deliver episodic, team objective maps. That's it.

The issue being, the maps and gameplay are inferior in every way to Chivalry 1. I feel this is because they were designed with the clusterfug gameplay of 60+ players in mind. Still, TO is better than no TO. The 40-player gametype is passable, but the maps are just not designed around a lower player count.

The combat is openly catered towards noobs. It's explicitly designed around giving  casual players the ability to acquire kills and defend themselves with little to no investment or skill. What this does is serve as a detriment to gameplay at the skill cap. High level dueling eventually boils down to a more rhythm-esque experience like Sekiro (countering and playing the initiative/stamina game). Getting more attuned to the combat feels like becoming more and more of an automaton/machine, looking for patterns in the ivy, without much of the human element that made Chivalry 1 awesome. My question is why? The experience is inferior in every way to the more hardcore nature of Chivalry 1 where deception, mental fortitude, timing, mechanical skill, all blended into the combat. 

Like any genre, casualization has infected the melee slasher. Here's hoping something comes along that's worth taking seriously.
__________________
Over 500 hours played in Chivalry 1. Chivalry 1 is one of my favorite games.
I already tried the game back at Epic release but decided to try here as well as a year or so has passed.
I’ll be frank with this review. In all, if you are looking for more of Chivalry 1, look not here. Chivalry 2 feels like a “dumbed down” version of its predecessor. Slow, methodical combat with map design and speed that allowed plentiful avenues for single combat are replaced with generally chaotic clusters and, ultimately, blob warfare. Mordhau also largely suffered this disease. I can understand the design philosophy: create chaos for cinematic effect and for players to have a more accessible, friendly experience, where easy kills are plentiful and generate dopamine. Sadly, the game is very conducive to mindless, arcadey fun. The game really evokes no competitive thrill. There appears to be no private server hosting capability either (or simply no one is hosting them) so it’s not even an option to reduce players on the map. Former competitive games modes that thrived in Chivalry 1 (such as LTS) exist but are largely empty.
I’ll pass.

The story as a whole is easy to pick up and completely optional for those who want or do not want to hear any. However, due to the fact that this game is mostly casual, the combat isn't too hard to pick up. There will be god-gamer sweats in most lobbies, but unlike in Mordhau, it's still playable to an enjoyable degree.

Unfortunately, archers exist in this game, and they are as annoying as you would expect in a medieval melee-focused game. However, you have plenty of options to counter arrows coming your way, either by dodging irrationally, using any type of shield, or not even going into view of archers.

There is music, and it plays at pivotal moments of battle. Pushing through a gate to fight a duke with only a few minutes left, an intense attrition fight; pushing back attackers from lighting a boat to explode, along with many, many other locations that trigger music to play.

Most, if not all, weapons are useful in some degree; however, there are two major weapons that newcomers stick to: the Dane Axe and the Messer. Now, these weapons aren't horrible; in fact, they're typically the best weapons in the game. However, it feeds newer players into the bad habit of constantly swinging without a thought. Though there are better alternatives in the game. The halberd and longsword make great alternatives if you wish to get out of the constant wall that would be set up against decent players.

Lastly, there are bugs in this game. Either with incompetent servers, rarely cheaters (on my end), or plenty of other problems that haven't been updated since the release. Though they start to show their ugly heads after awhile, in this amazing game that I and many others have fallen in love with. Unfortunately, with how Torn Banner has been treating the game with mediocre updates, a lot of folks have been in the downward spiral of what even Team Fortress 2's lack of critical updates has brought.

Chivalry's primary issue is its hitbox. it couldn't have been WORSE 

the secondary issue is hit animations and landing times are not matching with each other. i think this is also caused by hitbox.

I'll start by saying that this game is very good AT FIRST. I mean as a fresh install it's very enjoyable, especially when you don't have a grasp of the mechanics like a seasoned veteran of the game or like a mordhau vet switching over would. It's just a goofy medieval cluster fuck, and the majority of the community reflects that. And don't get me wrong, it can and will be fun for most people, even me. 
However, the game itself is broken in a bad way. I think most people will start to notice the flaws once they hit around level 100, but the game's still fun at that level, you're experienced enough to win a lot of fights and even sometimes take out a level 700+ player, but you will still be oblivious to the overall broken nature of the game. But once you really get into the sauce you realize just how good we could have it. Regularly hits will desync, hitreg will feel off, you'll pull off a sick counter slash and have the bright blue shield guiding your strike into a group of 5 grizzled assailants and as that dopamine is about to enter your brain, your counter gets counterfeited, their slash will just slice through your counter, as if god himself is punishing you for a crime you never committed. You will cleave someone in two with an overhead, only to see they actually didn't get hit by it even though you saw on your very own screen the sword on top of the enemy. And honestly if it was just issues like that on a rare/uncommon level, i would still recommend the game. But no dear reader, it doesn't end there. The developers of this game are grossly incompetent at their best and downright spiteful at their worst, and I say this as someone who has met and played with some of the devs before. The developers at torn banner have neglected this game like an unwanted child.
The new update is laughably bad, with even worse desync and hitreg issues than before, along with a map that's so bad I can't begin to understand how it got released the way it is. I'll go ahead and touch on the map issues first. Basically, the map is far too short, and it's far too busy. The first half of the map features rocks and slopes that are almost impossible to navigate without getting stuck on every pebble, which destroys the flow of any fight and makes using footwork effectively a pipe dream. There's also the terribly small choke points and the flow of the map feels like it was designed to make what should be 1-2 objectives into 4. Along with the final objective being both open but too claustrophobic and the entire map is far too easy for the heavily stacked attack teams to win. Oh yeah, I should bring up just how bad team stacking is in this game.
Team stacking is by far one of the most prevelant issues i've noticed. It feels like the community at large is silent about it these days, but almost every single game is a stacked one-sided match, usually with the attacking team being stacked the hardest. I have had dozens upon dozens of games end up with the attacking team having several level 100+ players with a few 500+ ""good"" players, and the defending team having a handful of okay players and maybe one actual good player. And as one of the good players I take it upon myself to try to help out the underdog teams, to keep it balanced. But what usually happens is I run into a fight with my team in a fresh respawn wave, and every single one of them die within 1-10 seconds, and I'm left on my own or with 1-2 teammates (both of which are most likely walking directly in front of me, blocking my hits and feeding the enemy ripostes and counters) trying to claw our way back to victory. And when you're on the winning team, it's just a unfun shit stomp, rolling over a team of level 15 players who are probably questioning their recent purchase of this game. It's gotten to a point where I won't even queue up the main menu gamemodes because I feel like an asshole playing the stacked team, but I also cant have an enjoyable time on the losing team because I just can't trust them not to grief our team by feeding the enemy counters and ripostes and having very poor game sense. 
And before you ask, yes there is a competitive scene. But comp scene is very grassroots and has been neglected by the devs for so long. There aren't private servers (they've promised they'd add them several times but still have yet to) and so the only way to hold tournaments is by either getting mod support or a password server, both of which involve contacting the chiv mod mail, which they rarely respond to. I mean there's only like 1-2 mods who even care about competitive (funk and cody), and while I and many others appreciate what they do (seriously thank you guys) it just isn't enough. The devs themselves don't actually do anything for the competitive community, prizepools on tournaments are very small and often player funded, and the devs are known to just randomly cut off their support from tournaments, causing confusion and anger within the community. What most clans have to do to be able to get practice in for matches or if the mods don't have time or don't reply to the mod mail, is they end up having to take over a empty dedicated server in the server browser, and they're forced to votekick anyone who joins. Which just sucks for everyone involved. It takes time out of the competitive player's matches to have to vote kick people, and it's really unfair to these people getting kicked, especially console players who don't have chat and aren't aware of what is happening. It causes a rift in the community with a lot of people (reddit mostly) hating on high level players from clans for kicking and being ""toxic"" when all they want to do is just play this game at a competitive level. 
There's a few more things I want to mention before I close off this review, like how almost every update has broken the game more. I can't tell you how many times they've broken vote kicking with each new update (bridgetown and the one update prior come to mind), which ruins duel servers every single time it happens. Oh and speaking of duel servers, I want to mention how fucked it is that duel servers are just full of people RDMing every single match, mostly due to console players not having chat. So if a console player joins, aside from the name of the server which they only see for like 1 second before they join, they don't know that it's a duel server, and I don't blame them. It literally says ""free for all"" at the top of the screen, it doesn't say ""duels"" or anything, and without access to chat on console they cant be told its a duel server. And even if you are a console player who knows that it's duels, you still can't read chat, so you can't even read chat to get context on stuff like a vote kick. 

There's just so many small quirks and bad will that has been building up over the years, to the point now where a lot of the community (casual and comp) are pretty sick of torn banner and just wish the game was handled by a different developer or finally given the love it deserves. Because the core gameplay loop of this game is something really special and good, and if it wasn't for all the constant stuttering and hitreg issues, and the badwill they've built, it would be a great game. I mean I didn't even mention until now how bad the ping in servers is, and how you can have a stable internet connection with 20 ping normally, but you will still see your ping spike up to 100+ constantly. Plus I mean it takes them 7 months to put out a small update and it's been like that since the game came out. So much of the comp community is burnt out at this point and honestly I am too, if it wasn't for community legends like Sun God putting out stuff like MFL every other week this game would be so dead. I mean the game is dead actually, like unless you're playing at peak hours. So the TL:DR is get the game on sale otherwise don't bother.",1682697064,1699727281,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,5,True,False,False

Also I have never gotten fatigued from a game this fast in my life and the reason why I'm fatigued/burned out from playing this game is because I keep getting cheesed by the game so it can't let me win most of my 1 v 1 fights in TO for example my war axe was about to hit a dude and it was an inch away from hitting him and somehow I got hit by his maul which he drew way after I did and I got hit by it when it was half way turning his swing with no drag or rotation at all and we both have below 24 Ping so we almost have the same connection and every time I keep getting cheesed by this canadian product I just quit and just feel exhausted of it. 

Instead of ruining this game by making false announcements of settings/features and silencing the community whenever they bring up features y'all were suppose to add to the game, how about just go back to watching the Maple Leafs choke another playoff run by losing to a 7th seed team in game 7 in the 1st round of the Stanley Cup playoffs!!!!!!",1699403144,1699593394,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hold block makes 1vX feel less impressive.  Everyone having dash is dumb.  If you think two people endlessly morphing eachother is good duel gameplay, you found your game.

I played a lot of Chiv 1 and was hype for Chiv 2 as there were things I missed.  I liked the clear class definitions in chiv.  something 2 has destroyed as the mixture of roles is blurred as every class has access to everything making classes pointless.

I also missed how you could tell who was on your team based on sound and voice lines.  This situational awareness meant chaotic frontlines were a bit less so.  Perhaps after playing longer, I would recognise all the voices in chiv 2 but I didn't notice much distinction between the factions and also found the identities given to Mason and Agatha jarring, as if we were playing a different game all these years.

Mordhau feels more alive, even though playercounts are slightly the other way.  Due to Mordhau players playing on community servers

Duelling in Chiv 2 is boring, everymap has some dumb cutscene on spawn and no auto healing.  And the opportunities for clowning are few and far between.  that gives the try-hard nature of duels a much needed lighter side and is a massive part of Mordhau.

Customisation UI is a chore, customisation in Mordhau is a joy.

Voice lines are kind of cringe, the performances and sound quality is good but something about the writing, everythings a bit tripe and watered down. 

The animations, frankly look janky. I don't mind it, it has it's own look that I would get with if everything else about the game was good.

So ok, you go the main TO queue where you might get 6 other PC players who know what they are doing and 40 players that at first I thought were bots, but now I guess are console players?

Also the soundtrack is absolutely epîc.

That.. was my old review. 

Today a patch released to fix the issues that plagued the offline training mode and various glitches.. adding a single map and new cosmetics, AND on top of that, MORE bugs and glitches to the game have been added.

From glitchy shadows to AI that gets dumber and dumber to the point of standing in place, going through textures that are randomly feeling like stretching all over the map, Chivalry 2 became an overpriced piece of junk that not only has a horrendous community but an experience and immersion totally ruined both by the players and the bugs, and as much as I love this game I simply CANNOT recommend it anymore.",1691571031,1699384221,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a day-one player, I feel the community has gotten worse overtime. I have installed and uninstalled this game 4 times since getting it on Steam. Entirely due to toxic behavior/chat.

It's not all bad mind you. Sometimes players will join me in my attempts to liven things up. They'll defend my positive words and sometimes join me. Usually though I'll congratulate the enemy on a good push, or my allies with their sudden rally against the enemy, only to be told ""shut up nerd"".

It's not the most toxic community. Dead by Daylight is much worse, or last I checked it was. But I find myself hesitant to reinstall to try out the newest update.

The tutorial tells you that you have to actually block an attack with your weapon, as in the two need to make contact, but more often than not I some how have my attack blocked by an enemy that isn't even facing toward me. I can literally see my weapon about to make contact with their back, but then it's just magically deflected because the enemy was blocking a different attack from someone else.

Team stacking is also a thing, really good players will join the attacking side and steam roll the defense in about 80% of the matches.

And don't bother trying to help your teammates, they usually get in the way of your attacks or they just run off and leave you to fight to 2+ enemies you just tried to help them with.

- Inertia is considered when you run and change directions with arrow keys but not when you turn with mouse? Someone can run around you faster than you can swing!
- Every spawn is on the blind side of the other teams spawn. You either slaughter poor players from their behind or get slaughtered from behind. There is no satisfaction. Just frustration.
- There is no sense of team balance at all in this game and it's deliberate.
- Weapon mechanics are just counter intuitive at this point.
- And why can't I hold my throwing weapon in hand at the cost of stamina like archers do? Why must I release just 1 second after drawing my throwing axe?
- And did you know you can block a thrown javelin when you are not actively looking at it? But for sword swings you must have the tip of the sword in your view to block it! Oh and you can block an arrow as well but it still hits you although at 50% damage only.
- And what's with going down on all fours when you take damage? When do you die and when do you start to crawl. And why can't you bring your self up when no one is around? But you can bring yourself up if you punch enemies' calves 2 times! Your teammate must revive your from crawling. This is the forced teamwork they make you do but reduced the team damage on swings so everyone is swinging around. In Chivalry 1 you had to be careful of your teammates and use stab/slash instead of swinging around hitting everyone. They take out the natural teamwork from game and push on an artificial one.
- Cheap servers. They can't handle 64 players at a time.
- And bugs! It looks like there is just one person working on every aspect of the game. If that is the case, we're proud of you Bob but you need to throw in your towel at some point.
- Matchmaking sucks, often times I get a server withing 2-3 seconds that's 250 ping away! I need to restart matchmaking twice thrice to get a server near me. Just give an option for maximum acceptable ping and let me wait till I get a spot on server near me.
- They do release new skins and micro-transactions instead of fixing issues. So you know where their priorities lie.

At best, you feel like a legend on the field, landing top spot and driving the objective maps to victory. At worst you feel like you need to head back to dueling servers to get your technique up.

The game has immense potential, we could see the mechanics being used in different universes like LOTR or Starwars. Chiv really has a functionally unique combat system that makes even playing the same maps over and over again entertaining.

Though the dev team takes their time for updating the game, it is still always worth diving into and being patient for it to drop.

For new players or people thinking of getting the game, don't be discouraged by high level players steamrolling or people busting out fancy feints. Dive in head first, find your groove, earn your glory. There are toxic sweats but there are also good folks who will fight with you and teach you how to hold your own.

Pros:
-accessible yet deep gameplay. I was able to deal damage and get enough points to be right in the middle of the leaderboards on my first games. Combat is intense and a clusterf--- in the best ways, and you'll be getting better almost always. however, ymmv. TTK is quick enough and spawning never takes more then 5 seconds.
-presentation. having battles start with a captain's rallying speech or a bit of lore is a really nice touch, and the lore isn't at all necessary to enjoyment--reminds me a lot of Titanfall in that regard. Graphics, voice acting, and sounds are also excellent.
-easy and vast customization and roleplay options, like communications wheels, armor sets, helmets, weapons, weapon skins, character faces, voices, hairstyles, accessories, etc. there are 4 factions, each with 4 customizeable base classes--Your Mason Knight can look different from your Mason Archer, but also look different from your Agathian Knight, etc. Plenty of humorous items and such as well.

cons:
-Price. 40 dollars is simply too much for a multiplayer-only game, no matter how high quality. 30 feels much more fair, with maybe 40+ being special edition pricing.
-lobbies can be WILDLY imbalanced, not to mention the fair amount of toxicity in chat that's par for the course in MP games.
-no private servers as far as i can tell, which also means no meaningful mod support
-not enough modes. I love the fact that most matches play out more like real-world sieges and field battles, but a set of more basic modes like CTF and some spins on TDM, like Free For All or Hardcore would be generously welcomed.",1698006092,1698199390,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only downside stems from the greatness of the unorthodox gamemodes, usually being a thematic part of an event.
The problem is that it is limited, and so the game has official, everstanding modes coupled with event-locked modes or simply modes that do not stay for ever.  These I find to be the highlight of the game, but also sieges.
Sieges are what differentiates this game from the likes of Mordhau. That game is a wretched game inhabited by smelly tryhards. No, in this game you do have skill ceiling but the combat feels much more fun. Duels are perhaps the weakest point of Chivalry, in comparison to Mordhau perhaps, however do not let yourself believe that this game lacks any complexity at all.

Just don't mind time to time collateral damages happening, so, hf and enjoy the video game!

PS. Only minus is that there is no good or intelligent MM (Rank based), many times you'll find yourself rounds like: No Lifes Vs. Still Got A Life, where is nothing interesting and its boring for both sides. Then it's better to move one and find a interesting match and balanced teams, when its tight it is a thrill. Also time to time hits wont registered or missed hits will be registered, bunch of other bugs too, like keys wont work and you have to do suicide (F10).",1693855557,1697997258,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is fun, mechanically straight forward and easy to pick up.
Unfortunately, this arena hack & slash genre doesn't seem to last long anymore.
You have your regular fans, and your diehard fans who love it whether it be this or mordhau, most of us spawning originally from Chivalry or M&B players. They just don't stay popular for long. Why, idk?

Well, swordplay is easy in this game, Rinse & repeat. Not much to offer, its objective based but still people play like its a deathmatch and just push forwards. It's fun, like I said, but only fun for so long.

I love the community here way over Mordhau though. Mordhau is ruined by moderators and gamers alike. This title atleast the big sweats aren't really that much competition. A lot less toxicity in chat, bc most people are too busy actually playing.

I don't game as much as i used to. I could easily be on sweat level, but being a casual (just hit 38) pro, I can still clock top leaderboards in servers w them where I am the odball out of all the level 200+ players at the top of the scores. Feels good, but when you're that used to the game, It's only fun for a few hours if that at a time.

Still, easy to pick up, over all more balanced classes, unlike mordhau which is heavily meta based (although you can do good with non meta weapons, its easy to abuse). Sure there are ""drags and accells"" intended to work a certain way, but the good thing here vs other places, they aren't gonna be dragging through you for twice the damage it's normally supposed to do. 

That shit is whack, and doesn't happen here. Every hit damage percentage is based on placement and how much power you put in to the charge. Combat is decent, arcade-y but overall enjoyable.

Unrelated but if I were to compare my experience bc there are people who would like to know this:

Mordhau- Solid game, swordplay is fun, more freedom to build what you want. mechanics easy to abuse though.trash community with trash moderators = completely ruined game. Dont care how good I feel about the game. They ruin the replayability. Also their servers suck ass. They only have like 2 dedicated servers per region at random times of the day for large modes. sucks donkey balls.

Chivalry 2: Easy out the box. forgiving stamina/block system(not time reaction based completely, there are bonuses to blocking at the right times though). Class leveling (and weapons) kinda sucks, but its not hard to level. you'll get good eventually. Matchmaking system makes joining larger servers easier, yet the community has shrunken since its release, game is best during peak timezones for certain regions. Not a lot of variety, but keeps it simple and doesn't overwhelm you so you can hop in and join the action. It was like this in Chivalry 1, so no big deal there I guess. 

Even though I favor Mordhau in freedom of combat and style, and the amount of things you can actually do given that type of system makes melee combat 10x better; Chivalry takes the cake in the end due to simplicity and easier to pick up and have fun in a few rounds. 

The moderators in Mordhau ruin that for you. They've banned dedicated players with thousands of hours from their community just because the moderator said so. Yeah, its bullshit. You don't run into that type of bullshit here which makes Chivalry automatically so much better. Also the non-existence of hundreds of meta mechanic abusers = 10x points for Chivalry. Mordhau dev's know it's a problem with some of their weapons, and they just don't fucking care LMFAO.",1659490650,1697994572,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me tell you, playing this game was like voluntarily subjecting myself to medieval torture. I'd rather face a horde of angry knights armed with foam noodles than endure another minute of this game.

First of all, the graphics. I've seen better medieval landscapes in children's finger paintings. The characters look like they were designed by a blindfolded toddler using Play-Doh. I half-expected the knights to start wobbling and collapsing under the weight of their own armor, which would have at least provided some unintentional entertainment.

And let's talk about the gameplay, or lack thereof. Fighting in Chivalry 2 feels like trying to juggle flaming swords while riding a unicycle on a tightrope over a pit of lava. The controls are about as responsive as a sloth on sedatives. I've seen more fluid movement in a slideshow of medieval stick figures. Trying to coordinate attacks is like herding cats – except the cats are armed with swords and have a personal vendetta against you.

Oh, and the sound design? It's like they hired a pack of howler monkeys and told them to bang on pots and pans to create the soundtrack. The voice acting is so cringe-worthy that I considered muting the game and just making up my own dialogue. I'm pretty sure I could come up with something more compelling, like ""I am Sir Clumsy, the Knight Who Trips Over His Own Feet.""

The game's community isn't any better. I've encountered more toxic players than a chemical waste dump. It's like every frustrated medieval history enthusiast crawled out of their basement, donned a suit of armor made of Doritos, and decided to take out their aggression on unsuspecting newcomers. If I wanted to be verbally abused by strangers, I'd log into a social media platform – at least there, I can hit the mute button.

In conclusion, playing Chivalry 2 was a medieval nightmare that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. If you enjoy frustration, terrible graphics, clunky controls, ear-piercing sounds, and a community that makes the Spanish Inquisition look like a tea party, then by all means, dive right in.

Switching weapons takes multiple clicks of the button as does jump which doesn't sound like a big issue unless you are in one on one combat.  The mechanics of weapons are supposed to be realistic but basic rules of physics are regularly ignored. For instance a two handed weapon cannot accelerate to full steep instantly from the furthest back in its swing. Stepping into that swing should limit damage but does not. Arrows travel at about 1/2 the speed they should and I find targets often evade a shot even though the arrow  appears to go through them.

- The game is finally released on Steam, but it was released with a lot of problems and instead of a quick patch fix, everyone went to vacation [SOLVED AFTER 2 MONTHS SINCE IT WAS RELEASED]
- This game is very well optimized for this generation, better optimized than Mordhau which was released 3 years before, but your PC can become a campfire so don't forget to buy some marshmallows [PARTIAL SOLVED]
- It has an amazing story which makes a lot of players fanatics and toxic [SOLVED]
- An amazing combat system impossible to exploit, just kidding everyone exploits it [SOLVED]
- The servers are decent, but most of them are laggy and every day there should be a server that it stops working for few seconds [SOLVED]
- There is no balance in matches, every time the players with no job will gather in a team and win, it's not normal... [STILL A PROBLEM]
- A buggy customization system [PARTIAL SOLVED]
- A lot of trollers are abussing the interaction system [SOLVED]
- Some maps are just too unbalanced for attackers [SOLVED]
- The horses have a lot of animation issues [SOLVED]
- Probably over 60% of community is toxic [STILL A PROBLEM]

Huge potential. But this is no more. DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE POSITIVE REVIEWS!!! Chiv has honestly hit rock bottom. at least in my opinion. Dueling servers are a joke, cant go more than one or two fights without being killed by a random, training grounds is a joke for the new player base, you have ppl high level like me vs very very low level players. How is that even fair???? Team objective with a party is yet another joke, you cant even play on the same team for more than a few matches. It'll put yall against each other.  Not fun.... The lag is a whole other issue as well. Coming from someone who runs 1gig upload and 1 gig download and still gets way laggy is a F'ing joke. Dev's basically left and noone knows when an actual update will be out. Given there history with prior updates i have no hope that this next one will be any good. The last few have been dumb, and more buggy than ever with no hot fix's to help. I loved this game and was my go to for awhile, but good things always have to die, and the dev's definitely killed this game. TBH they should sell it off to another team and hope they can fix what ShitBanner has ruined. The only thing postive about Chiv is that the cosmetics are dope, seems like they put more time into the cosmetics than the actual game itself.

1: This game is incredibly fun. It's a fantastic mix of good combat, great music, hilarious wit and incredible graphics. For anyone reading this and trying to decide if they want to play the game, it has a similar premise to that of Battlefield (when it was good) mixed with medieval combat. There's a pretty substantial learning curve, but nothing that should keep players from playing the game. When you understand the basics, it quickly becomes addictive, and incredibly fun. I personally am unsure how sweaty the community is, but from just playing the game, it's not very competitive at all. Even when I lose a match, I realize that, unlike other multiplayer games like CoD or Apex, or even For Honor, I'm not angry at the loss. I just join another match, and enjoy the game for what it is; a good game. Plus I'm a medieval nerd, so I love it.

2: For anyone looking to purchase the game, I wouldn't take this warning completely to heart, as it seems to effect only a very small number of people on PC. I'm not sure how, but my game crashes constantly now, at completely random times. Sometimes when i boot up the game into the main menu, other times when I play through a match and it tries to load another. I've tried everything, from graphics settings, to validating the game files, to uninstalling and reinstalling, nothing seems to work. It seems to be an issue with the game, and has only become a problem recently, as i was able to play this game without fail on my laptop a few months ago. The only reason I'm putting this in my review is because I don't know where else to go, and i feel like it needs more publication, as this issue has effected enough people to be annoying. I love this game, and want to play it more, but can't because of this bug. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.

Outside of this new issue, the game is amazing, and if you want a fresh multiplayer game that doesn't suck, and isn't just another cash grab like Call of Duty, give it a shot!",1696897413,1696897413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, a closer look reveals that this game has much more potential in terms of education and socialization, both within the family and society at large.

Firstly, ""Chivalry"" offers an interesting context for exploring medieval history and culture. It provides an excellent opportunity for families to spend time together discussing historical events, social norms, and even the ethics of warfare. This can serve as a starting point for deeper exploration of history and culture within the family.

The second aspect is the development of team skills and strategic thinking. The game requires players to coordinate, plan, and make quick decisions. These skills are useful not just in gameplay but also in real life—within family relationships, education, and career.

Socialization is also worth mentioning. The game brings together people of different ages and interests, providing a platform for communication and the formation of social ties. This is particularly relevant for adolescents who are in the process of forming their social identity.

Lastly, ""Chivalry"" can serve as a tool for discussing broader social and ethical issues such as honor, justice, and responsibility. This can be beneficial not just for family upbringing, but also for the education of society as a whole.",1696404063,1696404063,True,2,2,0.50519031286239624,0,True,False,False

One major concern I have is the revised historical setting. While character customization and representation are important, making a game based on a historical era like medieval Europe, which was predominantly white, can feel out of place. It's essential to strike a balance between inclusivity and historical accuracy. If the game took a more fantasy-based approach, it might be more excusable to introduce diverse characters.

Another issue is the heavy-handed approach to censorship. While maintaining a clean gaming environment is understandable, outright muting players for trash-talking can be problematic. Trash talk and competitiveness have been part of gaming culture, and muting should ideally be a personal choice.

It's crucial to consider that the core issue might be the tolerance level within the gaming community. It's possible that players have become too agreeable and should establish clear boundaries for what is acceptable behavior in the game. Striking a balance between maintaining a respectful gaming environment and allowing for healthy competition and interaction is essential for a positive gaming experience.",1696320394,1696320394,False,2,0,0.425429254770278931,0,True,False,False

One game you'll de-limb people with a giant greatsword, pick up their arm, toss it at their friend to stun them and then cleave their head off.

The next game you might suck butts and constantly get plowed through the eye by archers wielding great bows, or pinned to a cliff-face by a ballista bolt.  

There's a good amount of variation, the learning curve to start is moderate, but you can play and have fun after an hour or so of practice.

The learning curve to git gud is ridiculous.  I don't think I'll ever get there with my ADHD brain, there are just too many different things that factor into your movesets.  I love it.  Couldn't recommend more highly for those who want a really awesome, immersive but still fun siege multiplayer.

Attacks will phase through people especially heavy attacks unless you're right next to them
Enemies attacks will go through first despite pressing them at the same time with the same weapon

  The game has a bit of a learning curve and mouse and keyboard are best although it can be played with a 
  controller I would not recommend it, you lose allot of mobility with attacks. the game is mostly conquest 
  style objective team based games with a few other types of game modes that the devs alternate. Such as 
  Free for all, brawling and Holiday events I believe. All and all this game for the most part is fun. Learn to 
  watch your back, don't take fights you can't win meaning don't get caught up and become encircled by 
  your enemy's. That happens faster then you would think. 

  Watch a few videos on the youtubez to learn some combat basics. Always remember if you are attacking in 
  a group, shoulder to shoulder with a team mate CHOP CHOP vertical not Sweeping Swings horizontal. also 
  you can speed up or slowdown a swing even change the direction of attacks, learn this and you are half

The game has a few pros and some serious cons however, but I won't deter anyone from making this purchase if they want to.

First the pros-

1. Tech and Mechanics are really nice and easy to get into, the game can be made into a rock paper scissors fest where reading your opponents is vital to how you play. Accels and Drags still exists but not in a silly broken form such as Mordhau or OG Chivalry.  The game is accessible to anyone who just wants to jump in and have a good time as there isn't too much going on after you learn the basics. Maybe soft-feints and drags get a little goofy but as stated nothing nearly as broke as Mordhau.

2. Customization and personal effects on characters is fairly fleshed out, here is where I will give Mordhau the point however as Mordhau offers much more in terms of Customization, but the ability to customize here is still very nice and adds to the personality of your character. You can change Armor, helmets, patterns, voices, scaring, facial hair, and face template. Again it's not as much as Mordhau has going for it but it is still a very nice addition to the game, most of everything can be purchased with credits earned in game but some items may be locked behind a paywall which is why I still think Mordhau takes the cake on this.

3. The absolute silly-goofy stuff you can do in this game is incredible, from Yeeting rocks at people to beating someone to death with a chicken, there is a lot of choices to approach how you want to end somebody rightly whether by pommel or pomegranate (Don't know if it's actually in the game, but you can throw food and fruit at people for damage). 

4. The rather chill community that doesn't take itself super seriously, now you have a few people on here who absolutely feel the necessity to defend their sweaty titles, but as far as I've seen people do NOT take themselves super serious and often or not lend helpful tips to newcomers.

Now for the Cons-

1. Chiv 2 STILL hasn't fixed the Request null issue prompting you to have to change your wifi or disconnect your wifi and reconnect in order to actually login to the game. It can be pretty inconvenient at times, especially if you planned on playing with friends or not.

2. Servers suffer lag and bad interpolation from time to time, it isn't constant nor consistent but there have been times where multiple players in a single server complain about bad lag. I understand if the budget for the game is incredibly tight and there isn't a whole lot of space in it for better servers but I do highly recommend trying to buy into some when given the chance.

3. Certain voices past the OG's feel incredibly lack luster, like the Berserker for Masons or the Scotsman for Agatha. They have their personality but past the quirks of the voicelines they feel incredibly soft compared to what I would normally expect from them.  Maybe this is just a nitpick but I definitely feel that the Mason Knight, Agatha Knight, and Jolly Chef are the only good options in a game that offers plenty.

Again, I like the game but some issues are pretty major or minor at times so It's up to you if you want to purchase this game or not.

Ok I have played about 160 hours of the game and the time has come to write a combat review. I am going to split this review into two categories of pros and cons to evaluate it.


Pros:

The weapon skins look good.

It's pretty fun at low levels.

Swing manip is simple and easy unlike other titles, not much complex camera movement is required meaning most noobs will be able to participate in duels.

Range can be used to your advantage on long weapons.

I can see casual players enjoying this.


Cons:

Animations are generally floaty , sometimes feints won't resemble anything, overhead will look like slash and vise versa.

The many parry lockouts and cooldowns make the game feel janky and unresponsive

Counter-feints negate reading therefore the combat devolves into gamble reading and correcting yourself when you input incorrectly. Counter feints also dumb down swing manip (You can early counter, counter into an alt and run into the swing if its a drag).

Kicks are mostly useless gambles against good players so there aren't many ways to break an opponents held parry besides swing manip (read above) or draining their stamina.

Polearm animations are miserable to read. Riposte overheads look like flourish or something.

Initiative is non-existant resulting in confusing fights where a lot of the time you will take a longsword or heavy mace hit, directly after hitting someone and combo'ing. This is especially true with one handers.

The first person view models often obscure most of your screen, which isn't ideal when the FOV cap is so low. The alternative, thirdperson isn't much better as your player's model will also cover your opponents weapon thus making reading his attacks more difficult.

Jabs sound like a good concept on paper, but they are poorly executed in Chivalry 2, they are a mechanic used to re-gain initiative after taking a hit or missing etc. However nothing is stopping your opponent from jabbing you directly after you jab them, making initiative a sort of juggle between you and your opponent.

Spin to win is more alive then ever in Chivalry 2. Due to heavy defence, players have had to find creative ways to get around their opponents parry. Spinning was mostly a flashy move in other titles or a way to hide your animation but it is very viable in Chivalry 2 which is a bit cursed.

The fights sound like I dropped every pot and pan in my kitchen down a flight of stairs.

The counter window is as large as the windup of your weapon or something along those lines. This means that you cannot counter at the last moment to most accelerated attacks or you will riposte.

The many attack types like specials and alts result in an unnecessarily complex combat system, unless you have a mouse with 10 different keybinds you will often find yourself dying because you could not find your alternate stab keybind fast enough. These different attacks dont add more depth to the system but rather more muscle memory.

FTP (Feint-to-parry) is unresponsive so you will not be able to FTP successfully sometimes.

Dodging on every class results in fights that dont look like fights. It is not uncommon to swing at your opponent from your maximum weapon range, have them teleport out of your swing and due to the parry lockout, take a hit.

Matrixing is done by crouching and moving backwards, the animation however is really poorly made, you also cannot control your torso angle by looking up or down.

You cant parry arrows.

During a 1vX you are at the mercy of active parry which has been proven to be glitchy and unresponsive. A lot of engagements boil down to dodging around X opponents, riposting and blocking the rest of attacks with active parry (if it works).

Networking is unironically dogshit.

Pretty fun mechanics but just feels like a dumbed down, streamlined version of Mordhau. Will say its pretty good as a party game however the community seems...not inherently toxic but weirdly childish as well as a general feeling of teammates ain't being teammates, they're kill hungry gremlins that don't care if you or they are in the way if they see meat at the table; to put this in reference their is an achievement in this game you get by reviving 10 people and last time I checked 70% of players literally do not have this somehow. Also hitboxs for both character and weapons seem rather off though some of that could be my connection.

It is not my connection, it be funky. Watch a ""good"" highland sword user and you will laugh or cry. Man can parry you 4 feet behind his butt while doing the same in 2 other directions.

Is this game skill-based? To some extent. There are a bunch of tricks you can learn to fight more effectively, and you also have to learn how to position yourself, how to move, and how to be aware of the situation around you so as not to die shortly after respawn. But overall, you can run around slashing everything that looks like an enemy and have a fair share of fun.

Lots of players will switch to the winning team all the time, and nothing can be done about it.

NA East servers tend to be plentiful still, so game is still alive, but I don't know how well this game will fair in the long run player-wise. Still getting updated though, so I think it has a good kick left in it still for a good while. Fighting in big battles with your team is really fun and was the main draw to me and I find the game delivers on that well alongside other aspects.

I find the melee combat really fun and one of the best I've played alongside Mount & Blade Warband. The mechanics of riposting, countering, kicks, jabs, positioning, all mesh well together I find to make an interesting combat system I love to learn and play with. The feeling of becoming skilled at this game creates some intensely awesome experiences I could only find in this game. Graphically, the game is great, but the voice acting is where I truly fall in love with it. I don't get tired still of hearing the same screams and quotes because there is a large variety of them and all have a substantial amount to say with great personality. Being able to throw numerous types of objects is also great and is one of the funnier ways to get a kill. I will note however that the balance of maps is skewed towards attackers. This does make me feel annoyed at times to play defense because I know that certain objectives are impossible to hold and are made so that everyone reaches the map's final grand objective. The best way I found to get around this annoyance is to just enjoy the combat that comes and ignore the objectives slightly. I find that enjoying the combat with other players and having little moments on the side instead of stressing over the objectives makes this game much more pleasurable. And if your team somehow does win in those early objectives, great. 

Player balance-wise the game is the usual with multiplayer games where there will be the level 1000 players that will be a league above new players, but I find that the 32 players on each team allows one to play against players of high skill and low skill simultaneously. I didn't expect to enjoy this game as much as I did, but the game presents itself well and plays great as well giving me one of my favorite medieval combat games to date. Heavily recommend and would love to see this game get updated faster and see more new players coming in, and this is someone that only starting playing years after launch. Give it a try at the very least if you enjoy intense, dramatic, and satirized medieval combat game that makes those huge clashes reality, and makes you laugh along the way.

However, the more I learned about the game and how to play, the more I realized that the [b]game balance is REALLY poorly designed on a fundamental level[/b].  This combined with a couple of other big issues have really ruined this game for me to the point that the more that I play, the less fun it gets.

The biggest issue by far is that since they have introduced console crossplay the [b]servers have been absolutely horrendous[/b], with attacks and blocks not registering properly and enemies killing you from well outside their range in every single match.  If it weren't for this, I would probably still put up with all the other stuff below as well, but with it all combined together, was the tipping point for me writing this review.

Outside of the servers, my primary issue with the gameplay itself is that there are [b]a couple of strategies that will win almost every single time[/b], and most of the 1000 hour sweatlords that ruin lobbies for everybody else tend to gravitate towards those setups.  Combine this with the fact that a [b]large portion of the high level community will switch to the attacking team every single game[/b], and you commonly get a bunch of high leveled players stacking the same team and all using cheese strats against low level beginners.  [b]This makes games play very predictably, and it makes the high level gameplay not fun in my opinion.[/b]  

Prime example of one of these poorly thought out game mechanics is the [b]jab key[/b], which allows anybody to [b]interrupt any attack almost instantly[/b] with a quick offhand punch.  Since it is faster than all of the weapon swings in the game, it is [b]100% risk free to use,[/b] so long as you use it properly.  It more or less renders heavy weapons useless, the only reason you never hear about it is that the only people who know about it and use it regularly are the high level players.  A ""good"" player making effective use of jab spamming with a light weapon is effectively unstoppable without dog-piling them 6v1 or killing them with ranged weapons, despite the fact that this style of fighting is actually really easy to pull off considering you basically just smash the R key whenever anybody tries to attack you.

Also as an honorable mention: [b]Archers are extremely annoying and all around just a poorly thought out gameplay mechanic[/b], almost as if they were added to pull in and generate revenue from a group of players who cant or wont play the melee combat, and there is [b]very little counterplay against them (Only 2 of the classes have shields, and you can't block arrows otherwise, only counter them if you have perfect timing)[/b].  It is insanely dissatisfying to win a tough 3v1 in melee just to get picked off by an archer that you can't even reach without sacrificing yourself to the enemy spawn wave.  [b]There are no servers without archers or ways to still play team games without them present.  The only way to escape archers is 1v1 duel servers.[/b]

There are several other badly designed aspects of the game but I really don't have the space to fit them all in this review, so I'll leave it with these 3, as those are the most frustrating in my opinion.

[b]OVERALL:[/b] I can't recommend it for players who want to get into it long term.  If you're only planning on screwing around with your buddies for 20 hours AND the game is on a sale, it's a great buy (do wait for a sale to get other new players, otherwise the high levels will eat you alive).  However, if you were ever planning on putting in effort to get good at the game, and the image in your head of that was of epic and tense melee combat, [b]DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  You will not find any cool sword fights at high levels, only the latest game exploits, jab spamming, meta weapons, and other associated cheese strategies that are never any fun to play against.[/b]",1694278138,1694278558,False,5,0,0.512685239315032959,0,True,False,False

the game is fun when it works. but if you have a sloppy connection (good luck playing with any friends overseas lmao) you can find yourself getting randomly disconnected from the server you're on. with how bad the friend join system is that means you're completely out of luck, even if you *can* manage to get back into the server. there's no chance you're going to be on your friends team

there's also the crashes. which again, good luck getting back into the server your friends on if only one of you crashes. couldn't seem to find a cause for *why* it happens

and last but not least... easy anti-cheat. between being DC'd from servers because ""easy anti-cheat failed to authenticate""

these are issues i'd be willing to overlook because of how fun the game is even when i'm losing. but there seems to be a higher focus on pumping out premium/paid content than actually fixing the games issues, combine that with the fact that the game has some awful auto-balance and there's no in-between of ""New player"" and ""80+ hour max level expert gamer"" and there's very little reason to get into the game as a whole",1693349291,1694138252,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

But do expect another battlepass with broken skins this winter.

Incredible game, could say its the best melee out there. The combat is fluid and the learning curve is manageable, it is satisfying to play and can be quite addicting if you get into dueling. 

However the game suffers from terrible developers and moderators. There are bugs that has been in the game for months that are still not fixed. Griefers plague duel servers but never get punished, a moderator team that's quick to censor any criticism but will take 5-7 business days to respond to a help ticket, just to tell you there is nothing they can do about it after providing all the information they ask for about griefers.

I, due to my love for the melee genre, had put up with everything, even with the battlepass they're introducing, until today. The straw that broke the camel back was an interaction in their official discord. I logged on to have some morning duels and relax, and I was banned from the duel server due to griefer abusing one of the worst votekick system there is, for simply not losing my duels. I opened a ticket to get it resolved, never got responded but as soon as I made a meme on my situation and posted it on their meme channel, it was removed. Keep in mind that being kicked of the server simply because you're winning is a common thing, it happens often and unless you have friends in the server that'll vote against kicking you, there is nothing you can do about it, and TB has known about the issues since steam launch and had not made any attempt to improve it. 

Play it if you will, but don't expect to be treated like human by the devs unless you're actively shilling for the game.",1669739260,1693965917,False,4,1,0.534555733203887939,2,True,False,False

Combat (main chunk of the game) is phenomenal, multiplayer is addictive and enjoyable, connection issues are non-existent if you have good internet which is surprising for a game of this scale.

I have two main issues which are quite minor and easily addressable.
1: Servers do not have a queue system. If you try and join a full server you'll be kicked back to the main menu. Even when a free slot appears, if you're too slow and another player beats you guess what? Back to the menu for you bozo. Creates unecessary clicking and frustration. Easily solved by adding a waiting queue to servers.... Even Hell Let Loose, a game of much bigger scale and originally a tiny development team implemented this ages ago...

2: Small number of maps. There is only a handful of maps playable at time of review. After 10-15 games doing the same objectives starts to get a little old, but thankfully the combat is so detailed and well designed that this is just a small annoyance and not a dealbreaker.

Pick this game up for whatever price you can justify it for and lose a couple hours to Good Old Fashioned Medieval Fun.",1693832589,1693832589,True,6,1,0.583333313465118408,0,True,False,False

The game boasts a huge amount of content that is added almost very often, as well as very beautiful graphics of bushes, trees, buildings, armor, weapons and so on. in high resolution, so graphically you obviously won't be disappointed if you have a good enough computer, everything is done in full in the gameplay, there are many different modes from 1-on-1 duels to mixed fights, where 64 people are on the map, of course, it may seem that this is not enough, but with taking into account the size of the cards and the number of people who fit on this map, this is quite enough, also in the game everything is distributed by classes, there are only 4 of them - archer, infantryman, knight, vanguard, they all have different weapons and there are no classes that could have superiority over anyone, in this game everything depends on you, on your gameplay and of course skill, there is nowhere without it, the selection of players by levels, there is simply no such thing here. absolutely any player of the 1st, 100th, 500th levels, it turns out that you come to play, but you are constantly being killed by players who play from the very beginning, so you need a skill to somehow resist such players. The training in this game is well conducted, it shows the basic mechanics of the game, after which it will become a little easier to play, this is where my review will come to an end, I strongly advise you to purchase this game for fans of the Middle Ages. this remains the best project in its genre, this is my personal opinion.

I played Chivalry 1 a few times when it first released and I have few hundrends of hours on Mordhau, now I got a bit bored by it so I decided to give a chance to Chivalry 2 some days ago and I can say the combat system and customizations are an absolute downgrade from Chivalry 1 and mainly Mordhau:
1. The combat system is primitive and makes no sense in a meaning, as a HEMA practitioner, parry and feits of Mordhau are how in the result the combat irl works when you simplify it. Constant block in the result is almost nonexistent irl (to some degree it basically exists only around shields because they are wider than other weapons, and guess what, there is a constant block for shields in Mordhau, not for regular weapons). A lot of people argument that you can constantly hold the weapon in front of you irl, so why not in Mordhau, well, because irl you always block/parry in an active manner, because of various angles, so irl if you mess up the angle and so the timing, you virtually mess up the parry window and get hit and because of the various angles feints exist to make you mess up the angle/window, which is exactly how Mordhau simulates the result of this principle in a simplified way, AKA the parry system contains dealing with angles without actually having to deal with angles, because it would be a keyboard mess, I mean it might seem its just a short block, so it might seem it also makes no sense as the constant block, but as I said its about the result, its simplified in a right way, so when you interpret it right you realize Mordhau devs actually know how fencing combat should work, for the most parts atleast. Tho they actually tried to make a mechanic that somewhat gets you as close as possible to the manner of having to deal with atleast some angles and those are chambers, while chamgers are also a very smart way of how to balance feints (I mean dont get me wrong, balance is very important for a game to be competitively enjoyable, tho Mordhau makes it in immersively sensible way). Which gets me to what I also prefer on Mordhau is the direction of attacks determined by a slight mouse movement, I find so primitive to basically have only 3 angles of swing determined by fucking buttons/keys, it takes away the joy of feeling like you actually control the weapon, it makes you less happy when you successfully decapitate someone, because you didnt achive this angle. I understand Chivalry 2 devs tried to make the combat system more simple so more accessible, but Mordhau combat system is much more satisfying when you learn it, because you achieved something and still achieving it from there on every single time you kill someone, while it also creates very loyal playerbase that doesnt seem to want to die. Chivalry 2 aims on quantity over quality in its playerbase, but did it really work, I mean Google player count of both games and make your own opinion on this.

2. The customization of characters is very restrictive, while the presets of gear are laughable mess, from goofy shaped kettle helmets, to brigandine with lamellar pauldrons, to weirdly chunky swords, to Mason's Men at Arms forced around round shields (which atleast would make more sense for Agatha as they are said in the lore to be a bit more wild and primitivistic, some of them being stylized around early to mid medieval gear). Also most of the preset gear looks like an armor put together by poor looters, each piece of the gear feels like it holds no identy together and its there just so there would be atleast something, like its with lazy intentions, its so random. I mean in Mordhau you see few people walking around naked with pans as a weapon, which is the direct result of almost unrestricted customizations, but a huge majority of people are actually making gears that both look good and make sense (not neccessary in a realistic way, but in an immersive way, in individually functional way with stylization), which to me is pretty ironic as Chivalry, through its lore, presents itself a bit more serious around roleplaying, while Mordhau is the mess... right? Well, now it feels mostly opposite. I tried to give it many chances but I felt little satisfaction or fun playing it.

One of the only things Chivalry 2 does very good to me is the faction lore system, the sense of purpose of all the battles, the joy of having a favorite side and being a bit proud when it wins (and thats something I miss a lot in Mordhau and hope for it if we ever get Mordhau 2, as Mordhau now tends to be more nihilistic), its so good also because both sides are well thought through to be very relatable: one side wants people of iron, competent, skilled and inteligent society by any means necessary, a side that was frustrated being ruled by weaklings that almost doomed them, so they fight for taking the lead in their own superior vision, they fight for the greater good, while the other side fights for a wilder sense of freedom, honor, faith and solidarity (tho both forcing their ideology upon all others). Also map/objective design is very good in Chivalry 2 (thats something Mordhau could also improve on). And as a final thing for fellow archers, Chivalry 2 is a bit better for it, mainly because of the zoom and defensively functional layout of the maps, but everything else is goofy in a sad way, so much so Im disappointed of the very disappointment, I mean I was really excited about trying it even tho I knew there are some certain differences between Mordhau and Chivalry 2, but I wasnt ready for this. Anyway still I will continue to play it for some time, because I still want to give it a chance and I want to see what atleast 100 hours will do to me.",1692724575,1693024142,False,1,0,0.483852863311767578,0,True,False,False

Still, there are a LOT of bugs, maps or certain areas are badly optimized, community can be quite toxic in general. 
The dev team seems to not pay much attention to feedback, (mostly related to bugs that are literally happening for years now), there is a lack of content, believe it or not.

Furthermore, you do get the typical updated behind a DLC or ""Battle passes"" or however you wanna call them, and it's basically skins or rather re-colored versions or skins.

The thing that usually annoys people the most is the poorly made ""Attack VS Defense"" trope, good on theory, badly made, I'll explain further:

So the team attacking usually has the advantage, the times required for them to ""Win the round"" and move onto the next objective is more often than not, really unfair, and players on the Defense team gain significantly less points, and usually higher leveled people notice this and change onto the Attacking team right when the match starts, so it's automatically unfair right off the bat.

The game is quite good, as I initially stated, but there are a lot of little nuances that keep it from being great.

I'll keep on playing this game even after all the backlash I just said, probably sounded like I'm negatively ranting against Chivalry 2, but again, I do recommend the game!

since there's no rank-based ladder of which to filter out or incentivise the cheaters and sweatyasses alike to ♥♥♥♥ off with the rest of them, we noobs and/or ""bads"" have to deal with getting straight ♥♥♥♥ all over all game every game with not even a random lucky chance to succeed. or play with bots, in which case go play any other medieval game and that'd be better.

What is there to say other than the devs cover up their lack of fixing bugs that have existed since beta with updates and ignoring the issue. First issue, shit not making any sense. The little ass jab that interrupts FULL attacks mind you, is not outshined by a fully charged fist strike or even the exact same jab attack, even if stronger while fist is equipped.  It just doesnt make any sense why that is the way it is. On top of that, theres the garbage stab hitboxes, stab spamming is a complete strat based on the stamina it takes, range issues/range buff, and just complete disregaurd for physics. You can ""drag stab"", even though that makes literally no sense, you can also barely, and i mean barely if at all touch someone with any part of a giant box at the front of the weapon and they will take full damage, even from the sides sometimes. The devs dont listen, fun game until you get past the original joy and realize the game becomes a cesspool of bad servers and latency resulting in a very displeasing time. Its fun when it works, rarely, and when it doesnt you certainly have a mood change as a result. Revision: Game is still a buggy mess with servers and partying, hitscan only gets worse and the devs are extremely slow to fix issues lol
 Edit
Holy shit this game literally only gets worse, it doesnt matter what i do it always results in an experience that is poor. This game has to be some alien social experiment that tests the limit of the human brains ability to deal with fucking nonsense for extended periods of time. Every update the game gets worse, there is no doubt in my mind the game dev's are on a self imposed trip to actually destroy the shitty little pot of gold they struck. I dont know why the developers dont fix long standing bugs, decrease server performance, and add shit no one wants. Who the fuck wants a level 20 archer weapon???? This game is actually one of the worst ive ever played, the models look fine, everything LOOKS fine, but this game plays like a pile of dogshit. All you can do is hope for a better medieval game to arrive soon because this game is surely not it. fuck every developer at torn banner and everyone who plays this shit i dont even care.",1663543667,1691346037,False,0,1,0.458937168121337891,1,True,False,False

Multiple classes are available and they change your playstyle, but I must admit that there is no real skill in this game. There is some but only when you are facing one opponent, which is quite rare and eventually someone will run to assist you or kill you from behind. Most of the times you die after being attacked on all sides. Fortunately, the respawn is pretty fast, so you can try to take your revenge and die again. Playing as an archer is probably safer and gets you more kills from the distance. There might be cheaters, but it’s hard to understand who is really cheating unless you die with one hit and full health and even then I’m not sure cheaters are getting banned in this game.

game could use a real store where if you work hard for the currency everything is able to be bought with any currency of choice. especially if it just a stupid cosmetic. 

game does have an issue with hackers and cheaters but i guess so do all games of this nature.

game needs work on maps, more variety as well as 100 player servers., with possibly bots to fill gaps but i think devs have forgotten how to make decent bots in games nowadays.

graphics, movement and hit boxes work very well especially compared to games of this nature, only issue is the axes seem to just hit you no matter where you stand near by a players swing, the back of an axe shouldn't do 100 dmg when they swing it and somehow hits the player standing far behind them where the axe is clearly not getting to but you seem to get hit away.

they should have spent less time on cosmetics and some of the maps and combined a lot of the maps to have a real campaign for the game, that way players can get a real feel for the story and the game before vsing level 900 ranked players, as the movement can actually be quite complicated at higher levels.
a little read me box about the story in today's age of making games is honestly just lazy, then to add micro transactions it's almost laughably lazy and sad gaming has become this type of trash, its such an amazing game but then it has to be ruined with all these other aspects outside of the game play its self.

ill continue to play to support the game by playing it, but if you want more money out of people i suggest actually putting in a lot more effort than just some pathetic cosmetics. id even pay another 20-40$ just to have a decent real campaign in the game.",1690792606,1690792606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also tons of random terrain to get stuck on, dodge and jump are bound to the same button so it's easy to accidentally do one when you mean to do the other so you'll often die to stupid things like that.


There's no skill/level-based balancing/matchmaking at all, it's just click and join random server. Often matches will be terribly one-sided and completely unfair for one team especially in TDM, for TO typically offense is stacked the most because the respawns are in favor of them, commonly being <10 seconds for attackers and 15+ for defenders, and attackers spawn much more favorably close to objectives than defenders as well. Using third-person is practically cheating because of the swing-speed bonus it gives. People on console get ridiculously good aim-assist.

Not only do you have scum spamming the chat with anti-white racism (which of course the devs don't punish because I guess white people are just fine to be racist towards) but they'll also say the most nonsensical and unrelated things imaginable, and will argue incessantly about these things non-stop.

I disdain this community and any filth that partakes in not only the numerous amounts of violent racism I've seen towards Europeans and Whites, but also the ones who partake in filling the chat with feces just to start arguments.

Furthermore, I blame the devs, yes the people making this game, who only punish those who disagree with the ""current thing"" (aka banning those who defend their white/European heritage, because remember, ""muh white people bad""). It is 100% the developers fault that these anti-European anti-white racists are allowed to fester in this games small community, and because of these few scumbags, it causes more and more of the community to be racist in return, which the devs then globally mute the people defending their heritage and background because as I said previously, apparently racism is only allowed if it's against whites or Europeans. This creates a viscous cycle where the only players playing the game are violently racist towards Europeans and whites, which in turn makes everyone else either leave the game in disgust or get muted for defending themselves and then leave.

However they're sampling user input it's clearly still only valid for the last 2 sec before you respawn. It's annoying pressing F to commend immediately just to have to press it again because it didn't actually record anything since it wasn't ready. The auto-kick algorithms for AFK timer and team damage surely are inspired or based off of in some large way on the monkey sort algorithm.

I bet $100 that the button(s) to report someone don't do anything. You're telling me I have to keep a program running in addition to Chivalry 2 that records the last 30 seconds of my playtime so that I can file a ticket with the mods on Discord in order to report someone? But the button that's in the game is enough evidence once you press it? If you require 30 sec of video I highly doubt you even store the lobby chat let alone use any functions to get the reported player's Steam ID and then compare it to what was said in the chat. 

The game is pretty fun in spite of the massive flocks of incels and racists who play the game. The algorithm for ""You're leaving battle you're gonna die now if you don't return LOLS"" is uber hyperactive. The AFK timer is equally overly active. The game really feels like it penalizes you if you need to step away to use the bathroom or do anything at all momentarily IRL. Players are also aggressive towards you if you AFK for even 1 second in the spawn. They will team attack you or votekick you if you happen to AFK briefly. Something is definitely in the Chiv 2 koolaid these people are drinking to make them unnecessarily angry at AFK players. There's already an auto-AFK kicker to kick people if they AFK too long, anyways. This isn't a super popular game that has an overpopulation issue, so votekicking and harrasing players that AFK momentarily is pretty funny since it's not like you're going to replace that AFK player with a more active one given the lack of popularity and player population. The auto-team damage kicker doesn't work well at all. I've seen people who had to be votekicked for TKing and they already had 200 - 300 + team damage but the auto-tk kicker did nothing. Meanwhile, the autobalance algorithm is basically nonexistent. I've seen it ""autobalance"" maybe once or twice, only 1 players. There are many games I've seen where one team clearly has more higher level players and their team also has a 100+ kill lead. If the autobalance were to work, it needs to balance the teams better so battles aren't always boring when one side is stomping the other. It's odd the game has been out for 3 years now and still doesn't have a workshop for players to create new maps. The new Bridgetown map is neat, but it's only offered ""for a limited time"", which is an odd way of gatekeeping new content from players considering we have no way to volunteer our help for free to make new maps and the devs prefer to release a new map once every other quarter, sometimes longer.",1665116889,1690260046,True,0,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

On the other hand what passes for ""skill"" is often crouch exploits that give players free dashes in melee, rampant cheaters, and what appears to be unstoppable weapons no matter what you do. Today alone I watched as the ""king"" was taken down in one hit...twice! very very obvious cheating there. Anyone with a two handed ax just needs to keep swinging forever because there is literally no stopping them if you block, kick, punch, or hit them with your weapon, the same is true for swords it seems unless that is also another set of cheating. Many players appear to have arrows passing through them harmlessly. The thing about the cheaters is they are coming from Microsoft store, so EAC has no effect on them. The devs need to step up and set up in-game checks for things like weapon swing speed, damage, movement speed since there are hard-coded limitations to each weapon. Cheaters and exploiters are going to kill this game quickly, as they did Chivalry 1 and Mordhau.

The cross-play works well enough, but the versions of the game that are on PC do not function the same at all. The windows store version lacks many settings and the functionality that the Steam version has, which has become an issue at times when playing with friends who are, not on Xbox, but on PC.

Public matches were fun until the developers decided to give the game away on PS for free, ruining the little community there was by an influx of children or adults with severe childlike behaviour. Little bonus, the text chat? They can't even see it, so they often kick you as an ffaer when you try to help someone getting harassed.

Do you want to perform each and every basic move with a different keybind?
Do you want to play the piano?
Then look no further, Chivalry 2 is for you.

The control scheme of this game reminds me of old FPS games, where you would use the keyboard to look left, right, up, and down, instead of the mouse.

There are 9 keybinds just for attacking. I'm talking about slashing and stabbing, the core basic action of the game. Excluding the kick and throw.

They could have assigned 4 of those 9 attacks to the left click easily like how every other game does it. There are MMORPGs with less keybinds.

I can do every attack in Mount&Blade with left click, cancel/block attacks with right click. That's it. If I wanna stab, slash from left/right/up, that is my left click. I just move my mouse to the direction that I want to slash/stab from, I left click and it is done. But in this game every one of those attacks are a different keybind.

To cancel your attacks, you need a different keybind than your block aswell. If you use your block(right click) to cancel it you just block the air. If you press and release it real quick you can cancel it once or twice but eventually you are going perform the block animation. So again dedicated keybind it is.

You also need a dedicated keybind for ""running attack"". Because attacking while running is simply isn't enough, you need to press the magical key.

It's not too hard making it approachable to a beginner. The game has 4 main classes to choose from including archer, vanguard, footman, and knight. Each of the main classes contains a play style that allows you to play in many different ways. Each main class is comprised of 3 roles that you choose from in total allowing you to choose from 12 roles. It does have CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION for each class that you can manage with coins you earn by playing the game. It has multiple different modes and special limited-time modes once in a while. The game looks really well made with detailed maps and amazing graphics. Because it is a medieval combat game there is a lot of blood, gore, and dismemberment but there are options to turn them completely off. It has a little bit of comedy as your character might say comedic lines at times that can reference things. It does have micro-transactions like battle passes, bundles, and in-game currencies but they aren't shoved in your face and down your throat and you don't need them to progress through the game. The progression system is fairly balanced allowing you to gain rewards at a balanced rate.

At the very beginning of the game after the tutorial, you are asked which side you want to fight for, and this choice is utterly meaningless. I chose masons and yet, when I got into my first game, right off the bat i'm playing for agatha. I had to choose to switch teams, which is honestly a ridiculous feature in almost any game. It's a terrible gag and it demonstrates zero capability to properly keep games even. There is also a team autobalance system, which honestly just seems to not even work the second players might leave. i played an entire game with the player ratio being 9 to 11. Must be a really great autobalance system if it thinks 2 isn't a divisible number. The combat is atrocious rather you play archer or the other 3 classes. During my time as various melee units, there is a constant snapping that makes it extraordinarily hard to swing your sword, which is actually a fundamental mechanic in the game that gets hammered into you in the god dahmed tutorial. It almost seems impossible to swing your sword like an actual person would. The stamina system too. My god, the stamina system is ridiculously terrible. I would much rather go get absolutely wrecked by a centurion in For Honor having the stamina drained the entire time than simply try to have a normal fight in Chivalry 2. I can run dry of stamina after swinging one attack and blocking two or three attacks, then i'm broken and absolutely anyone can just wildly strike at me. I understand you don't want people blocking forever, and it could easily get abused if it wasn't handled properly, but it is far too late. The blocking system is already absolute garbage seeing as any attack i may give after a block most definitely isn't going to hit unless i can somehow get far enough out of a players view, and every person i've ever had attack me while i'm blocking is literally just non stop spamming attacks at me and they NEVER run out of stamina. How absolutely mental do you have to be to make that be how blocking and attacking works in your game. There is no skill, there is no following functions or getting into rhythms because the game mechanics go back on themselves and simple ideas you would think you just work simply do not. This game genuinely makes me feel like playing smart means playing exactly by a formula that quickly crumbles when you are getting ganked or someone is just spamming. And the archer class, by god. I have literally just watched my arrows phase through both enemies and teammates alike. Granted, it's a relief when a teamates steps in the way of the arrow and it just goes through instead of inflicting team damage, but when it happens to enemies it just makes any skill feel absolutely worthless. why should i even bother trying to hit a target 10 feet from me when the arrow will literally phase through their helmet. I enjoy playing the archer class a lot, and yet sometimes it literally feels like i'm trying to hold the game logic by a leash as it behaves like a wild rabies infested mutt that has no clue it even exists sometimes. it's even worse that the archer class literally run at the same speed as the knights even. there is no getting away if someone sneaks you or if you simply turn around and run away. It legit takes so long to start running, that if a small group of knights start rushing me from about 40 feet away, by the time i turn around and start trying to move, they're already swinging for me. This game is absolutely ridiculous and should never be taken seriously as any form of art. This game to me is the equivalent of staring at a painting that is a single stroke of white paint on a white canvas. Those in charge of this game should seriously be ashamed of their capabilities.

Update: i actually forgot to mention the stuttering problems the game has. get's a little irritating after a while. I've also spent more time using both mouse and keyboard as well as my controller and it doesn't really change much. I've also noticed how bad hitboxes are in general, which explains why arrows literally just clip through people. honestlty after spending more time in this game it's felt more and more like a joke and it seems like the community itself is also one. to each their own i guess, but jesus christ is this game just bad. i finally uninstalled and hope to never even have a thought about this game again.",1688296729,1688544590,False,0,0,0.438246995210647583,0,True,False,False

Map balance is really bad on a handful of maps.  Objectives, spawns, and timers need to be adjusted.  There is no reason you should be punished for doing well by having time subtracted when you win a stage (See: Raid of Aberfell attacking).

Hit boxes are awful.  Some weapons hitboxes are significantly longer than their graphics (ex: Messer).  In addition, sometimes you will desync and attacks will phase through enemies.  Combine the desync with a low tick rate, and dragging as a technique, and sometimes you are just going to have an awful experience.

Finally - The devs are mediocre at best.  Patches come out claiming to fix things, but they are not fixed.  They also ignore very real issues (desync, hitboxes, etc.)  Weapons unlock that are not in the game (ex: Level 22 Archer and the Siege Crossbow).

When this game released on Epic, it was one of the favorites in my friend group. It is an awesome combat game and its great with friends and when you just want to blow off some steam for 20 min. The graphics are great, progression system is a bit of a marathon, but overall, its fun! 

That was our opinion in 2021... Since then, very few bugs have been actually fixed, you still cant tell your team mates apart from the enemy due to cosmetics, the griefing system known as the vote kick system is abused so badly its maddening (if you're first on the kill board, people will try to have you kicked from the server- and it'll usually work), the bugs are getting bad and the balancing that should have happened long ago never came (a 5foot executioners sword swings faster than a dagger). The new maps are so unoptimized that you can barely fight, framerates are sh*t on high end rig and its so bad that they even had to put off the newest content due to it straight up failing to work AFTER LAUNCH. 
The microtransaction store seems to be what they focus on these days, rather than gameplay or anything important and the worst part is below...

Now, beyond those, you will run into this every few matches, and almost every duel you enter has someone fighting like this:

This type of cheating is becoming bad in the game and when you try and use the vote kick feature, despite EVERYONE in the match agreeing they need to go, the vote instantly fails. In order to report them, you have to go onto the community discord and here is what you need:
-video evidence
-ingame name
-Steam/Epic ID
I presented this dude off the video to them and provided everything they needed, and I got banned from the discord. I signed onto the discord from an alternate account and all of the threads that were there a few days before that were asking the devs to deal with cheating were deleted as well, and all the people that had been posting them were also gone from the discord.  SCUZZY AS F*CK GUYS! 

So apparently this is the new norm for this game and it has ruined it for my entire crew. 

So as a review of this game, I would say AVOID AT ALL COST as the devs sweep every problem under the rug and dont care about the game or players.",1683849489,1688516925,False,2,0,0.501061558723449707,0,True,False,False

-Archers aren't very OP

-Everything else,
-The combat is very janky, hits don't register, 360 riposting, elevation problems.
-Huge difference with factions winrate, after about 8 hours, I had 0% winrate (+95% winrate against) with one faction after almost 100 games played.
-Way too many bugs. fell out of bounds multiple times, bugged in death state many times.

- Stuttering
- Frame drops
- Teleporting enemies
- High ping in most lobbies
- Awful UI/UX

- Team and matchmaking balance

Game exit: non-existing.
No normal Exit option. Its either Crush+Send report window or black screen, which blocks your desktop or even BlueScreenOfDeath sometimes. You need to exclusively crush the game process through task manager to exit it. It is the year 2023 outside.

Netcode: non-existing.
It doesn't exist in the game. New map magically gives you 150+ ping on a random occasion. If you have 1+ people with a high ping, the whole server starts lagging. In close combat  game starts throttling network packets as shit and gives you x2 ping. Lads insist to scale their server infrastructure, instead they are making new cosmetics and one shitty map, which players hate.

Matching player's and server location for proper ping: non-existing.
It's recently threw me 5 times in a row onto london-classic servers, on which i have 150 ping. I kept exiting and starting again. It kept threw in london. f*** this.

Balance among classes: non-existing.
The balance exists only between knights or vangs with 2-handed axes and swords. Archers and footmen classes stamina, damage(this one depends) and health are pathetic. Even for their heavy-armored allies, wildly-blindly swinging their 2-handed weapons. 

Balancing of player levels between teams: non-existing.
Recently played a map, where our team consisted by 90% of <lvl10 people, while  other one was mostly >lvl40.

The fantastic gameplay, character interactions and fight mechanics are solid! I think each person will have their own tastes on this, but it is quite fun. However, its the ankle biters that make the overall experience a bad one.

First is the respawn mechanic. There rarely is a rhyme or reason to the timers and spawn positions. Nothing can be more frustrating to gamer and just sit in re-spawn timer hell while other teammates that died after you, spawn in a wave earlier then you. A few maps do not have the right atmosphere with those spawn points and timers;  leading to a incredibly  frustrating experience.

The second, is the objectives. Each objective has goals for a team, either push a column, burn a tent, hold a flag point and etc. Some maps have back to back objectives that do not contribute to the enjoyment of a battefield experience. One in particular, is the map where you spawn as peasants..... twice.... while the other team is fully geared and ready to go. In my viewpoint, players are human and will react as so. Forcing a player to be a peasant twice in a row against a heavily armed foe is not a fun one. SUre, you might get a zinger kill and feel good for that one kill. But overall experience on the map, is not for fun.  Contrast it with the other map where all the peasants from both teams duke it out before respawning in normal gear. NOW THATS FUN! It adheres to both sides on an even playing field.

Lastly, the topic of even playing fields. If you favor a map creation on just one side, it takes away some of the fun for the other team. While it's cool I can spawn in as a monk on last obj, how cool would it be if players on the opposing team could do the same but with their own niche as well. Then it makes the interactions a lot more fun.

All in all, I think the game has initial fun fare, but lacks sustain and longevity of both content and gamer engagement.",1688064354,1688064354,False,2,1,0.528301894664764404,0,True,False,False

This game is way different from the others I've tried. A new type of system with medieval weapons, it's combat system fairly easy to understand relative to MORDHAU which is similar in style.

Pros:
*Fun maps
*Excellent class balance
*Sound design
*Objectives are fun 
*Being able to take on more than one opponent is satisfying thanks to new mechanics
*Models and textures are good
*1st and 3rd person are cool

Cons:
[strike]*Somehow difficult to play with friends due to their invite system. Let us just join through Steam. Your main menu friends thing sucks, fix it or get rid of it.[/strike]
*Wayyyyy too easy to block/counter. This leads to fights that can last a ridiculously long time if both players have half a brain cell or played the tutorial. 
[strike]*Time to complete objective is completely scuffed and offensive team is completely unbalanced.
*Bugs galore  [/strike]
*Weapon balance is all over the place 
*Lack of voice chat leads to many moments where gameplay is negatively affected due to lack of cooperation

Honestly, I try not to compare this game to Mordhau because they're two different games, but in many ways it's clearly better gameplay wise and I'd recommend you check that out first before you consider getting this if you're a veteran of medieval combat games. If you're new to this genre however, I'd watch some gameplay and give it a try if it seems interesting. This game has a lot of potential to be great, but Torn Banner has some work to do if they want to retain their growing playerbase. THIS IS NOT A BAD GAME, it just needs some polish.

[strike] My honest recommendation for the devs? At the very least, please reduce stamina of blocking and/or increase the punish for it. It'll make the gameplay more smooth, fun, and fair. Work on the friend list compatibility with Steam. Lastly, the gameplay should be your top priority of balancing because Epic Games players apparently didn't give you enough feedback.

Side note (doesn't affect my scoring): This is not available on Steam Deck/Proton... why? At this point, there's no reason to prevent Linux players to play the game they paid for. Valve gave you easy tools to use to fix this, so please do that. [/strike]

Edit: 
I'm editing this review quite a bit since some significant changes have been made. Also, they enabled Linux support which was a huge plus and a big win for Steam Deck players. My only major gripe now is the weapon balance and archers are absolutely horrible to play as. Genuinely one of the worst archer experiences in any game.

The fundamentals of movement and combat are pretty terrible.  Movement is janky, the geometry is oddly 'sticky', like a ten year old game made by some third rate developer.  Combat is just nonsensical, the physics are just 'lol'.

It has crossplay.  So I will keep playing it.

edit:  I'm not going to keep playing it.  This is a profoundly broken game, the basic mechanics just do not make any sense.  You can easily be killed by a stationary weapon - I once went 75 and 5 just by learning to stab and 'wiggle' my mouse, exploiting the 'release phase', which causes damage.  like, devs, just go outside.  pick up literally any object and move it through space.  pick up a stick and swing it.  doing this one time will give you all the information you need to fix your system.  it really, really is that simple.  stationary stick = zero damage.  moving stick = some amount of damage.  it causes me psychic damage to type those words, but I do it, for you.  

roughly 25% of players are using 'auto blocker' cheat software, this becomes sadly obvious once you get decent at the game.  once you realize it, it's easy to exploit with kicks but come on... once 1/4 of your player base is cheating, it's time to fold it.

devs, i'm talking to you again: you know you've failed, here. just stop. you don't have to make a game available.  you did a bad job here, you've released a thing that made the world a little bit worse - just try again.  just stop now.  rest.  maybe next time make something not terrible.  or maybe pick another career, like welding.  or carpentry.  something you can be proud of.  something not like this.",1683448148,1687659401,False,0,0,0.491803258657455444,0,True,False,False

This is another game that takes the devs months to fix even the most well known, game breaking bugs, and that is IF they even fix them at all. There has been a problem with stutters in the game for a while. just a few months back a few people in this community found the source posted a temporary fix and sent there findings over to Torn Banner. Its been almost 3 months and they have done absolutely nothing, they even continue to release major updates which only further break the game. Cross platform was something that promised from the beginning but since release about a year or so ago has been barely functional if at all.
For me personally I really enjoyed this game, even just learning to play while dying over and over in the beginning but now that I know how to play all these stutters and other problems have just made the game so frustrating. If you want to go far you need to have at least below 40 ping or you just wont be able to fight. This game has decided I no longer live in NA west and now puts me on central or east servers which I'm lucky to get sub 100 ping in.
I have no idea what is going on over at torn banner but given their history and there neglect of this game so far I just can't see this game getting any better. The company seems like they will neglect the game because they can get away with ignoring us which is exactly how torn banner killed chivalry 1 back then. I will not recommend a game that the devs do not care about.

first off, goor (i may sound like psyco (i am not i think?))

i feel it could be better, the base game goor is good, i think something like dying light 2's system could make it look good, like add an ""extreme"" option, which would have that type of goor, things that i like in dying light 2 are the additions of blud pools and blud trailing, where the blud makes a stream, and also sticks to your sword for a second when you attack and hit. it looks verr cool. 

second, bot games.

i would like to see more options, i am kinda impatient, so id like to change the times, like for example, instead of a 30 second wait at the start of the game, you could change it to no wait (because its just bots), or instant respawn time. and as well as instead of the max score for ffa being 50, you could change it to 100, or no score at all, and just a giant battleground, which would be very fun.

However, it doesn't lack in the comical part of the original either. It's goofy and fun, but serious. If you've not played Chivalry MW? Then you don't need to read any farther. The game is amazing and you will have a good time no matter what. Nothing involving gameplay is locked behind a paywall. Only cosmetics! Just like it should be. 

If you are coming off Chiv1 after the actually recent complete death of the American playerbase? You'll transfer over fairly well. The only complaints you will have is customization and how all over the place it is. Chiv1's customization UI is extremely simple and IMO was superior. In Chiv2 you'll spend more time just navigating the UI for it but not to terribly bad. Also color choice isn't a thing anymore, as well as full choice of your insignia. You're color/insignia is depicted by ""Heraldry"" and they are set in stone color wise. There are a LOT of Heraldry options though, so it's not that bad. RIP days of making a full solid red/blue/white/black Knight. 

Combat is heavily updated but the same in many ways. You have a few other options in attacking now. Like heavier swings on ALL attacks, punching/kicking is now a thing alongside shoving still. Archers now have more attacks with bows. Like stabs with nocked arrows, punches, and kicks to create distance. 

Dodging with the MAA is now across the board. You no longer need to be a MAA to dodge. 

There is a jousting mode. I have not played it because I'm not interested. If I do play it I will update my review. 

There is a new faction, ""Tenosia"". This faction is Arabic in nature. Most of this factions customization is tied to gameplay and not monetization. I'm not a big fan of this faction honestly. I never really liked Arabic arms and armor. However, it is fairly accurate to history though and I can say I have no qualms with the addition of another faction in the universe. 

A lot more lore now. You can read the history of the world, and there are campaigns. They are NOT single player. More like progression with classes and feats to accomplish in game. 

Chiv1 players WILL be called cheaters and if you were good at the first game? Then your actual level is probably around 100 or so. I'm a level 12 and can take on level 100s more often than not in a fight. Third person is a bit closer than I'd like but it still is usable.",1687184892,1687184892,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game, much as it is beloved by its most dedicated community, is suffering a huge list of problems, and Torn Banner Studios is... interesting.

Firstly, I'm going limit mentions of this review's purpose to only Chivalry 2. Torn Banner themselves, and all previous titles before this in addition, will remain minimal at most. With that out of the way...

Chivalry 2, in its broadest strokes, is at its most, absolute fun when it works. Combat is robust yet simplistic, offering a lower barrier of entry than most other first/third person slashers to date, especially its predecessor and Mordhau as two big examples of comparison, but there's still a lot of room to work with in terms of manipulation and expression of skill. It is also only helped by the game's audio design being focused on the raw, savage cacophony of swords clashing against others, maces and hammers blunting against each other, and especially when such weapons collide with the person behind the opposing force. This is the part I have nothing but praise for, and commend the efforts of Torn Banner for characterising this so well.

HOWEVER... This is where my praise falls apart. Where the base foundation is absolutely solid, the supports, comparatively are not. There is, and have been, a myriad of issues that have plagued this game since even its very release, especially as of Patch 2.8: Raiding Party--and this is only further compounded by the current Patch not fixing *any* of the bugs introduced as of 2.81, most notably the Invalid Join Data mismatch and the horrendous stuttering issue that plagues a huge number of the community at large, and especially renders Console almost unplayable in many respects. Furthermore, Crossplay parties are still nonfunctional (Despite TB themselves claiming otherwise), and the stuttering problem is caused by how the game performs networking checks, which have been proven to be easily solvable by two people, one being Ziggylata (a notable community figure for Chivalry 2 as a whole), and the other a modder who performed a more elaborate fix that even reduces some of the drawbacks to Ziggylata's method. Finally, there is also the biggest issue that still exists, the netcode. It is not a comprehensible netcode, and due to the way it functions, there WILL be times you see weapons passing through players and dealing zero damage, among other things that can happen simply because... they can. And it has been this way since day one, and it is astounding that this has NEVER been touched upon.

Along with many, many other issues that add up, Chivalry 2 is a game that, at its core, is amazing... However it is also mired with a fundamentally broken set of supports that simply cannot hold the metaphorical house up. Why is this?

A part of this is due to development mismanagement, most likely, but it could be benign yet very harmful mistakes that weren't caught. Or it could be full incompetence. It could be anything, but historically, Chivalry: Medieval Warfare had no such large, glaring problems (aside from balance, far as I can remember), and it was much more stable in performance. Whatever the reason for all of these issues, it is inexcusable that such problems have existed for over a year, if not the entirety of this game's existence since commercial release, and that some of these fixes have not even solved these problems, and then created *MORE* problems unrelated to the original issue.

This game needs help, and while I want to dearly love this game, I cannot in good conscience recommend this readily. I would genuinely wait until the game recovers into a much more stable--and sustainable--state if you have any inclination to give this game a try.",1687042147,1687042147,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1685487197,1687024393,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

From S To F (S,A,B,C,D,E,F) i give this game a B  


time for my very indepthss review.

the game graphics are pretty solid i love how smooth the game runs with fighting with the blades and such. the sord fighing inside of it is also one of my favorite  with how the parrying and blocking works inside of it ,being far much better then the mordu game.  The characters are also pretty good some being faster but less health the basic type of the stuff that gives people the style they would like to go for. Being a tank type build or other garbage. 

Do i recommend this game Yes , if you like sword biased games  that is not  to difficult to learn this is prob one of the best choices , learning the combat in this is pretty simple.              The Game modes are also lot fun , you get to do 1v1s ,3v3s or go wild do 64 players matches 32vs32 taking over fortresses to other junk. 

i know im not doing the best explain  the game but main reason i wanted to comment is to complain a little bit maybe get some changes.


My first complaint is the combat. The combat is good but i want more , this game does not satisfy me at all. I want different postures for my different swords. For 2 handed weapons you got sheeeeeeet like , the plows guard , the fools guard , the roofs guard , the tail guard(its like ahsokas light saber posture) and ton of others. Now you be asking  what changes will this bring, it can simply change how much damage the sword does  , the swing speed of the  sword and   adding different attack animation giving that true spice in fighting. If not the stat changes to the weapon then at least try consider the different attack animation idea because you level up your weapon i should get cool different tricks with that weapon.

         Now onto my second idea. in the game you get this cool power move , you should also get more different power moves instead of just one. maybe a fast , slower one or instead of the sword going for a straight thrust maybe a 1 or  2 quick slash. the short sword does 70 damage for landing a power hit onto the person so changing that 2 quick slash to maybe 30 damage each. of course the idea of this attack would be able to be parred.  I personally dont see this as an bad idea both of these ideas add diversity to the game, im not asking for like 50 different types but around 2-4 different styles that a player can equip. What i want is more of that realism that i go against enemies with different style of attacks. Maybe that might make things to confusing who knows but thats just me.

                Issues. This is actual issues im now be covering that i think is unfair. when i first started playing the game i had to level up get other variations of weapons , thats fine and all but some of these weapons gives higher stats  to certain characters which i think is kinda forcing the character to not do a weapon they would like to use to something that  is ethical to use. with these stupid stat increases for differnt weapons of the character it would be more logical to let any class pick any weapon  in that case. like a officer using a rapier  or using the giant highland sword. mostly what im saying let us pick any weapon for the classes maybe that would be broken idk bro i want full power in my choices. 


    issue 2. i do not like the 1v1 arena maps its bit unfair. like one map gives you tons of shields , so it makes it pointless in a certain sense to pick a character that has a shield and makes it unfair for a non-shield character to pick up a shield. the character you pick is the only thing you should be given to work with not anything else. i dont have to much of a problem but i can see other people having that type of issue , so a easy solve, let the person pick the map. some of these maps have also death traps , to fruits you can throw , so add one map where there is nothing where people can go pick if there. (i would like a giant like piller where you can go fight people NO Walls so like you can be nocked off of and theres like fire surrounding it, just wanted to ask that) 

besides that there lot more i can say but im getting bit bored typing want like do something else. i would like if that one soul that actual does read this give me like their oppion i guess , like is this reasonable request mostly wanting see what they would think of my idea.

I played the Chivlary: Medieval Warfare for so so many hours. This ""sequel"" is like if you took Chiv 1, balanced a whooole bunch of stuff, removed all of the cheese-able stuff, added better animations, more customization, more dynamiclevel objectives, more useable objects on every map, more factions, etc, etc.

If you are a fan of the first Chivalry, you WILL love this one too. (There are a few key changes that take a bit to adjust to- Play the Tutorial!)

Bottom Line: I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the first Chivalry game, and I would highly recommend it to everyone to try. This is still the best series for a First Person Melee game, bar none.

Game is fun to play at times, but that's where it ends. The game is very unbalanced, from the maps to the weapons. Everyone uses a two-handed axe (Dane or Executioners) or the Highlander Greatsword because they are utterly broken. (Highland Sword got nerfed thankfully, Dane Axe remains completely broken).

Maps are unbalanced in the sense that the attackers get very high advantages while the defenders get shafted. Be it extremely generous time windows for the attackers, or an almost impossible way to defend objectives when the enemy attacker literally has a dozen ways or so to get to said objective - along with the defenders' spawn point literally being HUNDREDS OF METERS away from what you're supposed to defend. 

Everyone gets a dodge, which in Chivalry 1 was unique to the Man-at-Arms. Oilpots in this game are broken, they are spammed everywhere and even standing inside it for 0.5 seconds means you'll lose half of your entire health. Block-holding ruins the combat of game, paired with absolutely abysmal hitboxes, server lag and de-syncs. I have lost count how many times my sword or two-handed hammer literally went through an entire enemy's torso and did absolutely nothing. 

This game will suffer just like Mordhau and Chivalry 1 did, at least the combat in Mordhau was consistent. In this game it is not. Sometimes my kick interrupts and staggers a blocking enemy, or an enemy with a shield. Sometimes it doesn't. With the latest patch, the block hitbox has even increased further, which is absurd. You could already hold block and the only thing you need to time correctly are counters, now with how laggy, stuttery and de-syncy the game is - it almost feels like sometimes enemies have a 360 degree block window. Especially notorious on shield users.

Garbage. Trash. FIX THE GAME

For comparison, I also put around 200 hours into Chivalry 1 (which was the reason I even got steam), and 130 hours into Mordhau, the main competitor, and ~50 I would estimate of For Honor.
The classes are mostly balanced and feel different, can be tailored and customized decently well for the main 2 factions, and feel unique. The maps and objectives are often cinematic and large, and in first person, quite immersive. If you played Mordhau or Chivalry 1, I would add that they have changed the gameplay, mostly for the better; you can hold block, throw any weapon, and have an interrupt and special attack for each weapon, as well as the community being less toxic than Mordhau. There is still a mild, continued story told between the maps, for those who care about lore, with the recognizable factions and characters (and yes, there are named, playable characters too for top scorers) that give the game character.
However, there are some issues. Updates often come slow and are small in terms of new inclusions. More of the new cosmetics are locked behind battle passes, whereas before most were purchasable with earned ingame currency; unlike other games, the battle passes so far don't expire and you can do any you miss as of writing, but you still must pay for them. The third and new faction, Tenosia, has limited, expensive (for ingame currency), and honestly bad cosmetics outside of the newest battlepass. If you are used to the old Chiv 1/Mordhau fighting style and customization, then that can't be helped. However, those aside, the game is a more than worthy successor to Chivalry 1, and a better successor than Mordhau, in my eyes.",1686613623,1686613623,True,1,0,0.520905971527099609,0,True,False,False

There's a lot to be said about interacting with other players. It's kind like TF2 in a way, where the limited voice lines can make for some very funny conversations. Part of me is glad there's no team voice chat but I kinda want to see what kind of chaos that could bring. 

Even the game pass is nowhere near as predatory as some games. They give you unlimited time and you earn nearly all your money back over time. 

However, it is still a tough sell for its price. It's straight up only multiplayer and honestly the game could use a few new maps. What it has are great for the most part, with only some minor balance issues for one side - I'm looking at the latest map in particular when the attacking team has absolutely no time to complete their objectives. It doesn't help when it can feel that you repeat the same maps over and over again but the game play still holds up even then. 

One thing I would say is to please let parties stay on the same team. As much as styling over my older brother is fun, he needs all the help he can get! It ruins the night if we're switching teams half the time. 

Also, the fact that some weapons can hit you when you're behind the enemy gets annoying but I'm just nitpicking now.

There is a high degree of freedom in your combat style where you can mix things up to create your own style.  Blocks, kicks, counters, throws and a multitude of striking angles, accelerations etc makes it a very diverse combat system where you will bound to find something you like.  The game is however hindered by the following problems.

1) Matchmaking
From my experience with the game, very little thought seem to went into making both teams balanced during matchmaking.  Teams will have players in single digit levels all bunched up in a single team facing off against 5-10 stack level 300-900 players.  Teams also do not fill up evenly when new players join the game.  So you will have a team of 5 players vs 7 players but the new player will still go to the 7 player team.

2) Attacker advantage 
Significant advantage in favor of attackers in most maps as most attack objectives can be accomplished with bum rushes or involves breaking or taking certain resources that does not flip the progress bar the other way once attack side gets progress.  Defense side requires extensive knowledge of choke points as well as teamwork.  Which isn't to say it cannot be done but with how much of a mess the matchmaking is, attack side requires so much less teamwork than defense.  Attackers are also given way too generous amount of time to complete objectives, and the game actively hampers defensive side with very far spawns and the deserting system, which we will get to later.

3) Team swapping
The game allows swapping of teams throughout the game.  Which causes most players to pile onto attack side or whichever side is more favorable on the specific map.  Making the teams further imbalanced.  Which  makes defense side even harder to play when people straight out swaps off the team or just leaves.

4) Auto-balancing
The game's answer to the problematic matchmaking comes in the form of their ""Balancing"" mechanic that only seems to trigger very late into the match in which it force swaps the best players in the winning team.  The player that contributed the most in their team throughout the whole game into the losing team.  This is very insulting and disrespects the hard work the player put into the match.  So many games where you will think you finally have a good match then players fro other team will drop out of the game and you will suddenly get swapped into the losing team in the last 1-2 minutes just to take a defeat.  Which is extremely frustrating.

5) Deserter system
When objectives changes, you are given 20 seconds to move to the next objective zone or you will commit suicide once timer runs out.  And so many of these zones are sooo far apart especially when you are in the middle of an epic duel.  Some will have you run from the field all the way back up the walls while having 2-3 guys chasing you around.  This forces you to die and respawns if you catch the zone change mid fight.  The deserter zone also kills any ambush/backline assassination play styles.  While archers sits at the other side of the map sniping you with a warbow, you can't approach them without risking zone out if you run melee.

Once again, the game is not a bad game.  Combat is solid, graphics are nice, and the 32vs32 skrimishes are epic, but the game is held back by some very fixable problems.  A dive into improving the matching making and a tweak here or there on objective timers/zones and I believe it will take off.  But until these problems are addressed, at the current state of the game, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend the game to my friends.",1686140704,1686141408,False,2,0,0.502081573009490967,0,True,False,False

It's not just the kind of character you can play, it's the way people act and what they say. To me this the most important aspect of an online game, and I think it should be the most important aspect to you as well.

Gameplay-wise, though, the two are very similar. Chivalry is more forgiving to players new to the genre, while Mordhau is very unforgiving. The horse mechanic in Chivalry is, I'm sorry to say, garbage and Mordhau's horses are much better handling and much more fun. The graphics of Chivalry look more up to date, but Mordhau has much larger battlefields with less restrictions on where you can go or when. Chivalry feels somewhat more cinematic but leaves something to be desired.

Overall, I would recommend either game but they are very similar. The main non-community difference is that Chivalry 2 is very lacking in armour and costume options, which is the main reason I like games like this. Mordhau definately trumps Chivalry in the customization area.

It's a good game in its own right and has a large burden to bear by trying to carry on the legacy of its predecessor. Some of this it accomplishes with aplomb and in other regards it falls flat on its face.

Pros:
+ True cross platform play (after two years)
+ Hack and slash fun (no limb is safe from being severed)
+ Many throwables, including your own weapons and even severed limbs (and good ol' dung)
+ Pick up heads and throw them
+ Creative and great looking maps
+ Visual assets are fantastically drawn
+ Many great skins to look at
+ Despite having no private servers after two full years since its official release, there are pockets of good communities on Discord to find and join up
+ Weapons feel weightier and more impactful than from Chivalry: Medieval Warfare
+ Soundtrack is pretty good
+ Buck-Ock

Cons:
+ Bugs bugs bugs (the developers only focus on visual assets and adding new skins, they do not put much, if any, focus on fixing core game play issues so expect to see some bugs, sometimes they break the game)
+ Team balance is still very much an issue after two years. Expect to play entire matches with one team having four extra players and no one is switched by the game
+ Horse controls are very counter intuitive (you have to aim the camera in order to turn your horse)
+ Spawns for Team Objective maps could easily be reworked to make them more balanced (usually the game will spawn characters on one side of the map when there's two objectives, forcing the player to run all the way across the map when it could just spawn them center of the map)
+ Some objectives in Team Objective matches are not balanced well (looking at you Stronghold)
+ The developers are slow to address game breaking bugs and will usually do so when releasing new visual content such as skins or a new map


All in all, the game is great fun, but I would wait until there is a sale to purchase since the replay ability diminishes quickly outside of joining a community on Discord or having friends to play with (no private servers to hang out in and play with general community yet).",1686013814,1686013814,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not casual sicne you will die to one trick that you need to practice for hours in order to beat them. So really, you epic fights will be more of a fight that ends in 10 seconds cuz your opponet does a big mix of attacks.

Worse part is that there's no practice bots since the bots only attack mindlessly without doing feints or counters etc. 

So really, if you want to get something from this game, it's a game where you randomly die. Yes it's a skill issue, but just cuz you see it it dosen't mean you can fix it. You will keep dying to it until it's day 5 where you somewhat know how to counetr it.

So, if you're more of an objective gamer & really wanna make sure your purchase is worth it, do not buy Chivalry II in its current state. Even gesturing at its current state, I'm skeptical if there's really any hope for improvement though, considering the game released in June of 2021 (Two whole years ago as of writing) & yet it has the issues it has.

It's inexcusable that in a competitive game like this, this far out from release, your playerbase is still  frequently & randomly experiencing a glitch where one will not respawn after dying in the middle of a match. Typically, one will see a 5-15 second countdown to respawning after dying. Unfortunately, one will frequently encounter an inability to respawn, having died & being left to only spectate for the remainder of the match.

Research online suggests that many others experience this issue, some reporting that they'll respawn after waiting 8+ minutes, suiciding (F10, sometimes multiple times), or by switching teams after getting stuck. Waiting 8+ minutes, even just 1-2 minutes is absurd in itself but also when considering how thoroughly one is impacting a match while effectively being benched for that long. Suiciding negatively affects your score and doesn't seem to work most of the times I've tried, sometimes suiciding 5+ times to no avail. Switching teams, you either can't in a full lobby, or will feasibly give up & lose a slot on a winning team.

The only truly reliable way to get around it is to leave the match, wipe the scoreboard, and hope that slot is still waiting for you on the way back in. Got 34 kills & only 3 deaths? Sorry buddy, if you want to respawn, you're gonna have to set that back to 0 & 0 for me real quick.

In addition to that issue, which can really ruin the high of doing well in a match, there's a stuttering problem that the playerbase has been experiencing. In a game where the visuals you can perceive within a fraction of a second tells you whether to block or swing to win a fight, sudden freeze frames & frame skips (stuttering) can frequently land you headless when you were certain you made the correct input 0.8 seconds ago.

Thankfully, there is a fix for this issue, conveniently explained in a video by Ziggylata on YT:
 - Chivalry 2 Update Stutter fix (On PC)

This fix basically involves going into your games files & deleting a file. While it's an available solution, and does work (from experience) it's another absurd issue to have this far out from release & when considering just how important visuals are here compared to something like XCOM 2 or Civ VI.

That concludes my review, fingers crossed they fix these issues some day.

I enjoyed the first game and Chivalry 2 is even better. While I do like the game so far, it has some problems. I can't recommend it at full price. Buy only on sale. I'm also not sure for how long I will play it, because of these problems. 

[b]1[/b]. Players can switch between teams, in the middle of the match. It may sound rude, but there are real pieces of shit in this and many other online (especially PvP) games. It can get annoying soon. Some players just can't play without being carried by better players, and they lack decency to stay until the end. So while these degenerates get a free win, after changing team, the opposite team tries to avoid the inevitable. Of course there's also newbies and those who can't carry others, so the balance is not a thing. Note that this game doesn't even have ranks or anything competitive. Imagine what can kind of game this could have been, if ranks were at stake. At the moment, luck favors the coward.

[b]2[/b]. No connection filter/ping filter. I checked connection few times, every match. There were always at least a few people with close to 100 ping, often above 100, and even one guy with 220+ ping. You can say that in this chaotic mass genocidal game it’s not a big deal, but I will politely tell you to go fuck yourself. If the game has a really low number of players at the time we search for a match, then okay, I can live with 100+ ping players. On a regular basis? No, thanks.
Also, you can't check connection of other players or your own, other than ping. Even with good ping, players can lag etc. Either the data shown is fake, or server quality is below average.
Today I saw how few players just disappeared. I was fighting with one. They haven't DC.

[b]3[/b]. There are technical problems. When I changed an active character customization menu, the previous one haven't moved away. Two characters were standing on the same spot. ""Texture clipping"". I had a similar thing with weapon, in training mode. This time, my sword was in the air and not usable at all, while I had fists as active weapon... Imagine if it was a real online match.
Recently had a bug where I couldn't use/equip any weapon, after using horse.
Had server-side stutters/connection problems recently. I've seen players teleporting.
The game crashes with error, each time I quit it. Not a big deal, but it makes the game look like an EA/Indie game.

[b]4[/b]. There's one very low quality voice. It sounds like it was recorded with a cheap microphone, at home. I'm talking about one of the locked sounds. Not DLC or Northman.

[b]5[/b]. Customization is poor. 

I'm very sad. Faces are just presets, and there are only a few, not very attractive presets. The game is far from historical accuracy, so why make these faces?

Lacks of hairstyles.

Lack of facial hair, and you can change beard and mustache separately.

No face paint colors. I understand the armor color based on faction, but why force face paint color? 

Speaking of armor color. There are few armors without distinct blue/red color. It makes it harder sometimes to tell who is who.

Serious lack of customization options, and there's no shop for separate parts, like helmets and hair. Selling items is a good idea. It's an ethical way to get money. Players don't an advantage, as with XP boosters etc., and they know what they are buying (hello loot boxes).

With current DLC and updates, you can customize your character to not like a knight, but there's still lack of choices. No discrimination against knights, but since we have highlanders, horned black knight and now a Huscarl, why not introduce (fictional/popular design) the vikings, mongols etc.? This is what got me interested in the game For Honor. You could play as a fictional Viking, Samurai etc. The game was bad, but you got the idea.

[b]6[/b]. Maybe I'm a bit picky, but I'm not a fan of attacks based on how fast you can move your camera. It also looks silly. I saw a random video about another, similar game - Mordhau, where a guy moved like a damn spinner. Do you really want this type of game?

[b]7[/b]. Armor customization interface isn't the best.

[b]8[/b]. Too often, too many people just stand still, doing nothing. No auto-kicks or bans.


[h1]Final[/h1]

Buy on sale.

UPDATE 1: Changed review to negative. While I still enjoy playing the game, I'm not going to spread lies and BS. Reasons are below.

1) Poor quality of online matches. I mentioned it before. Players all around the world, with any kind of connection, can join your server, and you won't even know if they had bad connection, unless you obviously saw it. 

2) Progression is bad. I play normally, and receive cosmetics as rewards, but as I said before, customization is bad. There aren't many cosmetics to earn or ways to customize your character. Also, too high level requirement for some items. You will have a clone character.

3) Some classes have trash fixed loadouts. I remember that one good M&B Warband mod had equipment, which you could buy for money. You had to play better to get more money, and equipment was different for each class. In Chivalry 2 there are too many limits. I mean, how often will you use spikes? And that throwable toy for Vanguard? There are few others, much better options for class system/loadouts. I mentioned one.

4) King knows how many times I played with passive players. Literally each damn time I play the game, there are at least few players who don't do anything. They just sleep and give the other team free kills. Auto-kicks and permanent bans are necessary here.

With all respect, fuck the Tom Banner and his gang. Unless they fix these problems...",1671033109,1685726068,False,0,0,0.544289886951446533,0,True,False,False

Getting kicked after a few games IF on the off-chance we did get into one.

I feel like the devs should focus more on the play-ability aspect of it than adding in ""New Modes"". They need to take a step back and acknowledge and solve errors and bugs. The fact that I can't 1v1 my friend in a combat game is mind-boggling.

Would definitely recommend for anyone interested in role-playing as valiant melee fighter, or perhaps a sneaky ranger. It's really up to you and your personal play-style.

Two (2) things I would suggest the developers to improve: new maps and new cosmetics. The game needs more maps, and the reason players all feel this way is because after around 60 hours players will literally have played all maps a couple times: and it feels kinda dull to have so few rotations! I also felt it takes too long for Torn-banner Studio to come up with new maps: the average time it takes for a new map to come out is about 5 months! The second suggestion about having more cosmetics is so obvious when you compare it with Mordhau: Mordhau has literally infinite combinations of cosmetics, whereas Chivalry 2 has way less options to choose from.

However, I still recommend this game because its flaws are so negligible compared with its core mechanisms! Go Chivalry2!",1685192048,1685192461,True,2,0,0.502380967140197754,0,True,False,False

The first step: Make a cool, informative steam guide like the one your reading right now.

It's a total blast, and the weapons and classes offer a good bit of diversity of playstyles. Unfortunately, I cannot give this game a positive review, because nothing about it works. 

Due to the influx of new players from the game being put on PS+, the servers are completely overloaded all the time. At best, this is a mild annoyance. At worst, some of the weapons that require more precise aiming and timings are completely unplayable. You and your opponents will teleport around, strikes will faze through enemies multiple times per game, and sometimes a server will just time out and end the game. 

Assuming your game does function on a technical level, multiple main features of the game have been catastrophically broken by the latest update. The queue system for arena modes, which are some of the best modes in my opinion, is terrible. If you solo queue for arena 3v3, it will either 1) fail to connect you, resulting in you having to queue all over again, 2) connect you to a game that is LITERALLY already over, as in the win animation for the other team is playing by the time you load in, 3) should you be lucky enough to be playing with a friend, the game will place one of you into the game and force the other one into spectator mode or 4) connect you normally. This fourth option is, in my experience, a pretty low chance. 

An honorable mention for bugs plaguing the game is that pretty often upon joining a game, it will randomly change your equipped weapon/class. While not game breaking, it gets pretty annoying.

Despite the developers commitment to crossplay, allowing you to party and play with people on other platforms, the game lacks many key social features. There is no way to add friends from within the game, as even though the game gives you a friend code to share, it is regenerated every time you view it, making it impossible to send to people through the chat. Speaking of the chat, there is no way to party chat or message an individual person. There is no support for custom games, so to 1v1 a friend you have to connect to one of the (usually completely full) duels 1v1 servers, which are just free-for-all that relies on player etiquette to keep people sticking to respectful 1v1s. Usually, this would be moderated by a votekick system, in which people who interrupt others 1v1s can be removed from the server. Like many other things in this game, unfortunately the votekick system has been completely broken by the latest update and no longer works 90% of the time.

In my opinion, complaints about the games balance are overdone and frankly overstated. The games balance is pretty good, you can perform with just about any weapon, and there's a good variety of playstyles to master.

Should this litany of issues I have talked about (+ a good amount that I haven't) get fixed, Chivalry 2 would be one of my favorite games of all time, and I would be recommending it to anyone with a steam account. Unfortunately, in it's current state, my recommendation is to wait 6 months (or more) until the next update to see if they fix any of this before giving it a shot.",1684816901,1684872622,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False

It's not due to janky mechanics, however the balance of pretty much everything all over the place. The main reason I'm not going to play it anymore is because the playerbase is beyond toxic. Do not use the chat function in this game or you will be screamed at for the next 5 matches before being votekicked. Do not kill an archer because they will go out of their way to focus you and only you for the entire match. The game's ability to show skill is also very poor. Instead of getting kills most of the time, you end up getting takedowns (assists), but that affects your KD ratio. The average player will end up getting 5 kills, 10 deaths and 40 takedowns if they are a good player. What is the point of this system, to try and tell people they cannot do a good job trying to play for their team? Screw this game and screw it's toxic playerbase in particular.

There is a pretty good variety of great TO (Team Objective) maps that all feel different each time you play them, they aren’t balanced that well but that doesn’t really matter that much, because it is a pretty casual game where losing isn’t that devastating.

Combat wise this game is absolutely amazing for someone who wants to play a medieval combat game that is easy to step into, it isn’t like MORDHAU where you are expected to put 100+ hours in to the game to be not completely trash (not necessarily a bad thing, just not something you want if you are looking for a more chill game). Like I said, there is a pretty good variety of weapons and most of them are viable.

The classes are also done pretty well, you have a classic knight class, archer class, vanguard (glass cannon) and the footman (in-between the knight and vanguard health and speed wise). Within those 4 classes you also have subclasses with different pros and cons.

The maps are great, even though they aren’t balanced all that well, it doesn’t really matter that much. Each objective is fun, the only complaint I have is that attacking is more fun than defending (some people switch teams so they are always on the attacking side, pretty annoying), but I don’t see how they can fix that.

The cosmetics are honestly pretty shite, there isn’t a lot of customization (way less than MORDHAU) and what is there is pretty meh (for armour and weapons).

**Currently there is a big issue where the game completely freezes for 1-2 seconds every match or so, that wasn’t an issue last year, unfortunately now it is an issue…**

Conclusion:
This is a great game if you are looking for an easy to step into medieval combat game with great gameplay. If you are looking for something more competitive/with a higher skill ceiling/higher skill floor, I would recommend MORDHAU.",1655243445,1684607505,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

it also doesnt help that 90% of the games combat boils down to mirror matches where you and your opponent just counter each other until one of you screws up

customization is also a big issue, unlike mord where you can customize anything about your loadout, from the chestplate to the shoes. chiv 2 is restricted to body armor sets and helmets and some of these sets look a bit tacky and stylized.

aside from cosmetic customization there is also barely any loadout/weapon customization, your given four classes and usually three subclasses that you can pick from, all with their own strengths and weaknesses and are restricted to their class weapons. so unique playing styles are completely out the window as you cant be creative with loadout customization, compare this to mordhau where play styles range from your usual heavy knight to a wannabe shaolin monk jumping and weaving through attacks.

and if your the type of guy who is frustrated and annoyed by ranged fighters in these types of games then you won't like the fact that two out of the three melee classes you can pick from have subclasses that have throwables and are pretty much played like pseudo-archers, staying in the back line and throwing throwing knives that deal an absurd amount of damage and unlike the dedicated archers, they can actually hold their own in melee.

chivalry 2 sets out to make the slasher genre more open to casual players and it achieves that but it's held back by its janky combat mechanics and lack of customization, as a person whose been playing mordhau casually on and off for a long time and have reached what is probably the zenith of casual skill in there, mordhau just seems more appealing.

however if your intimidated by mordhau then get this game, you'll have good fun.
but, mordhau. despite all of it's flaws has surprisingly less jank than this.

1: The game has been out for 1 year on epic game store. However hitboxes are complete BULLSHIT, catapult stones land on a different area from what you see (ex: the catapult fire was supposed to land at least 100 meters in front of me according to what i was seeing, it did, yet i died and the crater was created right on my body). Halberd is a complete joke, at least 180 degrees angle on the hit without the player turning the camera, short sword (and not just that one) are apparently as heavy as a two handed polehammer and swing as low no matter what the weapon stats say and the respawn system is a parody. There is even a map where you can respawn beneath the map and just fall and die. 15 of my team died that way at the same time. 
    Again. 1 year out.
2: Maybe they fix everything i mentioned above. Even if they do they will not fix the hilarious kick system. I was kicked twice in a day and lost around 1 hour of my life just because a snowflake was insulted when i said ""this isn't a chatroom, shut up and play"". Both times same reason. The votekick requires the majority of your team to pass. Unless they make it to request the majority OF THE SERVER this negative vote stays here to contribute to the negative percentage of reviews.
**EDIT**
Also the game says it has customization but that's a pile of bullshit. Your knight wears ONLY what he decides he wants to wear for the battle. You want to wear no helmet? Well bad luck, you are now forced to wear the ugliest most basic helmet because fuck you. Because we are the Chivalry franchise devs and can't even fix that bug, yet our modders make a much better game than ours called ""Mordhau"".
Achievements count only when they decide they want to count, there is one for 50 kills in a match, i get 50 kills every other match, yet nothing. It's still there to be unlocked. These people dared to rob 30 bucks for this shit.

*UPDATE*
Game is still a piece of shit. Hitboxes are still total crap, you see 360 swings everywhere, no turn cap, you just swing around and hit everyone like you're fcking Deadpool. People block hits coming from their back and even if you stand behind someone, his swing will hit you. That's how bad this game is. Seriously there ABSOLUTELY no reason to buy this piece of crap instead of Mordhau. It's AGES ahead. Player skill base is beneath the sewer, one faint or morph will confuse them and you can hit them. They just spam left and right click. That's it. Oh btw, you can block for like half an hour before you are out of stamina, but hey you can kick that person and the block breaks. Why not kick while there are 10 people swinging at you anyways right? Waste of time and money.",1655749806,1684177485,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game is fun both for newbies and casuals, and do not require 2000 hours to have fun. High-level player stands little chance versus an organised group of casuals once surrounded.

Archery is well balanced too: it is not OP, but not symbolic either. Horse riding is rudimental, but fairly enjoyable. Scenarios are fun and tons of animated emotes, screams and commentaries are meme material. 

Animation is meh. Very Bethesda-like, wich is not a compliment. Also, character faces textures are very low-quality, wich is annoying, given how pretty the rest of the game is.

they say the devs are hands on but these main factors have never been fixed since release as well as so many other issues said by the main player base. 

The player base is also an issue with griefing and afking. The tutorial also does a terrible job at teaching objectives, so you have so many players clueless for so long. This game is free PS+ so you know what that also entails.

The game really is all about ""git gud"" in your ability to play. I've used all classes and truly no one class is better than the other if you PLAY them. I've defeated shielded knights as an archer, I've stormed through vanguards as a footman. You just need to read the battlefield, know your strengths and weaknesses and it's a very fun game.

It's very immersive and keeps you playing for a long time.
Skins are cool and very lucky to create mixtures.
Some of the quotes are funny.
Very Detailed.

Dislike:
Toxic chat (least amount of times)
Teamkillers (Idea: If a player kills a teammate, it should have the same idea as R6 which is to deal the damage to yourself instead of the player).
No skins for one of the factions.

Ideas:
Add more skins on a daily basis.
Anti-Exploits
More Badges
Campaigns (Like Call of Duty)
More Maps
Self Customization for cloth patterns

1. Customization is kind of lacking compared to competitor (Mordhau)

Bad mechanics miles away from what the game is from (age of chivalry source mod that was a super melee game), even mordhau did a better job and yet it's boring asf as most mechanics are useless cause they designed it around one mechanic only : delays and drags.

Animations are bad

Class selection is bad

Mouse sentitivity restriction is infuriating and badly managed (kinda like in chiv 1 btw). No dancing trully allowed.

All the bad sides of modern melee games trying to have fancy animation and all but resulting in unresponsive game with absurd 3d movements on player's screen.

But when in game, oh the guy parried you, making his massive 2 handed axe now as fast or faster than your knife which now takes longer to swing than his 2hnder.  Ya, I get they want to balance things out because then no one would play 2hnd battle axe, but thats ridiculous. They strive for combat ""stages"", which largely negate an advantage of weapon choice. 
 Gain some realism.  Sword and shield had been used for thousands of years... and these guys down play it to make this game stream lined.

2. Plus, allow people to choose their class instead of grinding thru the shit play.

3. I watched as one guy can sit in the middle of 5 guys, riposte one of them, then kill 4 of the attackers.  WTF is that bullshit.  Realism? Not even close.

4. Full plate armor means the attackers have to hit vital areas or tire the other guy out, not just swing once and BOOM, 3 guys are dead.

Summary: Realism is shit in weapons, armor, and combat itself.  All they want is a hack and slash game... Mount and blade is far superior.",1683141736,1683611561,False,4,2,0.421494543552398682,5,True,False,False

I'm editing this to add that they had the resources to add a paid battle pass, but cannot fix bugs that should have been fixed before it came to Steam at all. 


I'm editing this AGAIN to tell you that the latest update has effectively destroyed the viability of one of the classes, the engineer. As an engineer you get access to barricades you used to be able to place strategically around an objective in order to slow the enemy down, but now this is made impossible. On Thayic Castle, the first objective could be defended by a single engineer if his team remembered to come beat the attackers off, now, you can't place anything near the shacks. You used to be able to make a little bunker for Argon II to hide behind from arrows and bolts, no more. Engineer was by far my favorite class to play, which now i probably won't even look at anymore because now it's just a class that takes more damage from 75% of the weapons in the game. Guess i'll just pick up a highland sword or dane axe and swing around from left to right with no regard for my team, like the most of the other players already do, amplified by the introduction of cross-play.",1668292668,1683570790,False,0,1,0.486163049936294556,0,True,False,False

A good comparison would be that Mordhau is akin to a HEMA match, while chivalry is akin to a bar fight. both demand similar but very different and sometimes contradictory playstyles (eg: Chiv doesn't reward melee headshots beyond guaranteeing a kill with a beheading, while Mordhau rewards melee headshots with increased damage, sometimes to OHK levels)",1655490082,1683454408,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My True issues with this game.
Archers - The Archer class is fucking insulting and absolutely dog crap, Imagine in any game in history when you lead your shot with a bow would your arrow be able to hit its target if they are moving in only one direction? The realistic answer is Yes, Yes it absolutely would. In this game Chivalry 2 Arrows do nothing like this, the way it seems the devs have designed arrows and archers specifically makes it to where if your Crosshair isnt Directly on the person your shooting at it misses no matter what, and if your target is moving from left to right or right to left well your arrow will never hit because you cannot even lead your aim to have your arrow hit your target like in every single video game ever made up to 2023.

Class System - The Class system I assume has its reasons such as balance however is also absolutely garbage, The main issue is that the Class system has 2 Sub Classes per class, For Example Vanguard is the Main class and it gets two Sub-classes one specializes in CQC the other Specializes in dual wielding or something (I don't know because I don't play Vanguard). All Classes in the Game follow the same premise However in order to unlock that class you have to reach a specified level in order to pick one of the other two options for that Classes sub-Class Making all the stupid overpowered Meta weapons everyone and their grand parents used locked to new players who will constantly get stomped on in every fight due to this issue.

Customization - Absolutely a joke no effort was put into Customization you cannot even buy better weapons and use custom loadout's or kits that you make, The only customization is the Colors your wearing for each of the 3 Factions in the game, There is no Customization to the point where when a new player is playing this game for the first time, you get so little its sad and you cannot even try out any of the other Sub-Classes your just forced to use what the game gives you.

Team Stacking - Yeah this game has tons of it, if your Not on the Team with the Highest kills you basically lose every match and the Player to Player skill level is through the floor one team will end up with players who just got this on sale and  the other team will be level 400+ on the opposing team.

Graphics - I'll give the game this it looks pretty when you can stop and take in the view from time to time.

Maps - The Maps are massively unbalanced and favor one side or the other side heavily to the point where there's no reason to even try to stop the enemy team from completing the objectives because your just going to lose no matter what happens Unless you somehow end up pulling a hail marry then good luck.

Game Modes - Currently the game only has 5 game modes that you can choose from (this is not including those stupid limited timed event maps) This game's game modes are fun in concept but are unbalanced due to the map issues present in them, This game also has no PVE mode except for the Offline stuff which is boring quickly the Enemy Ai in this game are so brain dead stupid they just run directly to you and your other AI teammates (Sometimes) and even to the point where if your standing in a specific spot they will just commit suicide in a pond over and over just to reach you. So there is no Horde Mode then whats in this game? Well there is
  ->  Invasion and Team Death-match and that's it other than the Arena 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 stuff but that's literally it other 
       than mounted warfare which lets you ride a horse and die constantly.

And that is basically everything in this game, Otherwise I can only say that my experience with this game has been horrible it has small glimmers of hope sometimes but otherwise I would not even recommend this game to anyone that I know at all due to the issues present in the game its just shit if you want a game that feels real and not some sick cash grab of a genre that Torn Banner abandoned a lifetime ago play Mordhau at least in that game you can have fun.

This entire review is coming from someone who has only 16 hours playing this game so far probably more later if they ever end up adding better modes to the game.",1683357084,1683357313,False,0,2,0.401144057512283325,0,True,False,False

has real nice gameplay, the maps are nice plus all of them have small details that make them fun to explore and play in furthermore  the combat is fast and easy to learn and all the different classes  are fun to play .
But the biggest problem i have  with the game are first the new maps that are never properly optimized and 
are laggy for the weaker pc and the second problem are the bugs , that are  getting corrected really slowly so that you can wait for a bugfix for half a year.

So in total nice game and  i would buy the game again

I do not know how... but the game sucks even harder. Yes, I know, I play a lot witha a couple of friends... but matchmaking and social features have gone to the worst state ever. Pls do something right

Matchmaking sucks
Want to play with friends - can't play with friends
Want to join friends - can't join friends
Want to add friends - can't add friends
Want to kick trolls and feeders - votekick is way too hard to pass
No 64 player standalone servers
I mean, I like the game and alongside friends we've managed to have fun occasionally.
Great idea, ambiance, music. But it needs to be balanced and have a better social experience. It's absolute feces.

Edit after 57 hours more

It still needs improvement. I think that adding horses to some maps is fun but for 40 player modes it totally kills game pace.
Social features still suck hard
But if you want to brainless kill and have a good time with friends this is it

EDIT AFTER ANOTHER 99 HOURS

Yes, I may enjoy the game with me laddies. But votekicking feature is still absolutely useless. You'll always have to deal with at least 3 or 4 griefieng, trolling, and negative saboteurs. 
Its been a couple of months since the game doesn't exit properly, seems like sending the crashing report is as well useless. You will still spawn somewhere down in the void or abyss forcing yourself to commit suicide.
I'll keep playing and hoping for more improvements, I would like, eventually, to change this to a positive review",1662345110,1683169061,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The combat is the big thing here so let's talk about that: it's solid and surprisingly broad. You're able to swing from side to side, thrust forward, overhead attack, charge swings(you can do light attacks and heavy attacks), special attack (dependent on the weapon), kick to break blocks, interrupt enemy attacks, riposte, dodge, morph attacks, and feint attacks. And depending on your class you have additional moves as well: the footman can do massive damage with a charge attack, but it can be blocked or dodged, though blocking this attack will leave the player open to a normal attack. The knight tackles, which same deal, leave the person you hit open to attack if they block it, but if they don't they take minor damage and their ass is knocked to the dirt for a painful few seconds where you can get a free hit on them. And then finally there's a sprint attack for the vanguard which is a really powerful and quick leaping-slash that can often one shot people if it's done from behind. Your class, of which their are four to choose from (archer, vanguard, knight, and footman) also have three additional sub-classes which come with special perks that charge over time. These perks would be the horn, which is an AOE healing effect, flags, also an AOE healing effect though its far less effective but continuous until the flag is destroyed, medkits, which heal a lot for one person, firebombs,  which burn people, and fortifications and traps. The latter perks are often the least used. 

So, to summarize all of that real fast: you can do a lot already with just your weapon, but your weapon also has a special attack, YOU have a special running attack (unless you're an archer), and you get some sort of perk that charges over time which can often turn the tide of a fight. Not to mention just like in Mordhau you can accelerate and drag your sword swings by turning with your attack and practicing good footwork, and that is on top of already being able to charge your swings which would delay an attack already.

 Speaking of Mordhau, let's talk about that too: the combat in Chiv not as intricate as Mordhau's, but I honestly don't think this is a bad thing. It's far easier to grasp for noobs. As a level 20 I was steamrolling people in the triple digits. Granted playing Mordhau religiously probably gave me an edge here, I've had the same happen to me now that I'm level 100-something.  The combat is also far harder to abuse too: like in Mordhau people can still feint spam, but because you're no longer only able to parry and can effectively hold a block their animation manipulation isn't nearly as damning and generally punishes only themselves. That being said you do have a ""block meter"" which will gradually empty the longer you keep up a defensive stance and when you actually block an enemy's attack. The larger the weapon or the heavier the swing the larger portion of your meter will go down. If your meter goes down, you're disarmed, and if the actual swing of the weapon (the damage is increased) goes past your block meter threshold you take damage as well. That being said, feint spamming is pretty worthless because you'd only be wasting your own stamina, not your enemies. It's far more effective to just hit them with your weapon than to try and snake-eyes every millisecond, and that's just how I like it.

The battles are cool, down right cinematic at times, there's events almost every week, and the chaos generated from the battles is just awesome. The only thing that I think is lackluster is the game modes: there's TDM 1v1, 3v3, 20v20, and 32v32. Respectively, there is also a death-match, which can also have 64 players max. Those are pretty insane. There is a gamemode where you can ride horses, which is alright I guess. The weekly events are neat: brawls, bar fights, and archer-only fights are welcome. There's no true PVE gamemode besides offline practice and the tutorial. Training grounds is a thing, but it's technically PVP/PVE cause there's 15 bots on each side, plus 10 players tossed in, five on each side respectively. 

I really don't have much to say about the game con wise. The fashion is lackibng, but what's there, most of it anyways, is really cool looking. Nothing is really pay to win, it's just cosmetic. Some armors can't even be paid for with real money which is pretty rare now-a-days.",1682612922,1682997070,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you push the envelope into more creative iterations of these systems you'll do much better down the line than previously.

But please don't invest your money in a multiplayer game with a dying playerbase. If you don't play at peak hours, you're more often than not stuck with 4 v 5 in a 64 player map. Yep. As of today, just one laggy server is barely able to be filled (sadly a quarter of those players will be AFK) and that's only if the lone working server doesn't crash. 

The devs rarely update their own game and when they do it's half-baked ideas (ex: the terribly implemented mounted combat mode is a ghost town and long abandoned by the community). The game breaking (stuck in animations - unable to attack or defend and constant map loading crashes, anyone?) and QoL bugs that never get addressed just make you wonder if they care. 

Finally, if you do get a rare match going, the majority of the maps are unbalanced. Ex: You can run off not playing the obj as an attacker on Dark Forest and still win. And because all the level 500-1000 players teamswitch to the winning side, you can be stuck on a team full of newbies and console players (no communication) who can't coordinate.

I find myself thinking ""I wish I was playing Battlefield right now.""

The biggest problems I have with it are around the combat and movement of the characters. As an example, one move available is a push kick which will stun the target, but only if they are blocking the attack. What kind weak bitch gets stunned by a push kick that they block with a metal shield? Why am I being punishing for being fast enough to recognize an attack is coming and blocking the damage? It's like the developers were going for decent realism as a whole, but just randomly decided that some aspects should be totally unrealistic.

I have seen plenty of reviews talking about the matchmaking and it's failures, so I will simply say 'yeah' and move on.

Moreover, the in-game store appears to be a vehicle for pushing players towards purchasing downloadable content, ostensibly for both cosmetic and level-progression purposes.

While the Chivalry 2 community does seem to possess a certain level of camaraderie, it is predominantly comprised of individuals in their early to mid-teens, along with a significant number of individuals who could be characterized as deplorable eccentrics.

I love this game, I've always been a fan of medieval games but games like Chivalry and Mordhau are something else, I played Mordhau since launch and at launch it wasn't bad at all but then it just got worse and worse and the playerbase just died. When Chiv 2 released on Epic I was like this looks really bad cuz the combat didn't look as smooth as Mordhau but I decided to give it a try when it came out on steam and holy fuck this game is so fucking good. I absolutely love the atmosphere, maps, graphics and the gameplay. Its way more balanced and I really love the different classes you can choose from. So far I've played 11 hours in 2 days and I really recommend this game, love the feeling when you and 31 other people charge into battle and everyone starts to kill everyone it looks like a cinematic movie. Also the maps look really fucking good.

edit again: came to the realization how the balance is really bad to the point now where i don't have fun getting stomped on defense and it just is not fun to play attack because your more likely than not stomping  the other team and i just feel empty beacuse there's almost never any challenge. honeslty this games super fun half the time you play and a complete shit show the other half. also the community is pretty toxic.",1669948281,1681776232,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game has no sensible combat - devolves into a back and forth until stamina depletes and one of you gets disarmed...then they draw a weapon and block your next attack anyways. (Even better, get that blue counter only to get blocked...what's the point of timing anything other than to save a little stamina)

Archers got the shaft, no pun intended. 3-4 arrows to kill any class that isn't an archer unless you become a god of headshots - which still takes 2-3 hits to kill someone. Meanwhile, captain full plate runs up without making a sound and one shots you with a 90 damage attack.

Even more fun yet: People throwing items at you nonstop because there is no time involved to pick something up. Legit a strategy to use a crate to kill someone.

Capstone it with a level locked system for classes to get the more effective weapons and a new player gets to drag their member through glass just to get on an even playing field.

Not sure why this has any popularity when Mordhau has a much better combat system and kit system.

This game has everything else to make it so fun, but the glaring glitches and clipping issues on maps just makes it un-fun to play or can just make you tilt off the planet. I honestly worry for my mental health when I play this game, no other game makes me as upset as this one can, because of moments where my hit won't land, or somehow the enemy has timing advantage despite weapon speed, or i get caught on some badly clipped rock or stone that prevents my character from moving in any direction, or situations where my teammate is downed but because of some revive glitch I cannot lift him back up and just watch him die before my eyes.

At least in other games when I get upset, it is at my opponent or maybe a weapon is overpowered and should be nerfed, or cheaters, etc. But with this game there have been too many times where I have actually felt CHEATED out of winning a duel or fight because of a glitch. Every dev diary is just mentioning new maps and new content, nothing about addressing issues like where the siege ramps don't properly fold out and cause players to get clipped at the top, etc. Honestly pretty disappointing when there are so many glaring issues with this game engine and how it interacts with the game. Like trying to throw a med kit to a teammate, the engine is so broken and the hitboxes are so messed up that if you accidentally misthrow even SLIGHTLY, your medkit will go flying in the total opposite direction or just bounce flying in some random direction if it hits a teammate with full health. How is something so basic like this still in the game? Why not just have the med kits deaden upon impact and fall to the ground and stay there? at least i could pick them back up and try throwing them again. Another situation that is similar is if a teammate blows their trumpet/horn to heal their teammates at the same time as you, thus negating the effect of your horn and only one of you gets points. There shouldn't be situations where you just waste your trumpet if no teammates can even be healed, it should at least come back half full if not a single person is healed, thus allowing you to get it faster, or something else that can balance this effect. Sometimes the refresh can be minutes on this, just making it that much more irritating when it happens.

I could go on and on, but the point being that I'm sure many of these issues have been around since the start of the game and it doesn't feel like they ever plan on being addressed. I've honestly decided to uninstall this game and no longer play it until I hear about some progress being made on these glaring issues for the actual gameplay and balance between teams. If some progress is made on this, I would be more than happy to change this to a positive review! The gore is fun, the humor is dark, the voice acting is both amazing and terrible, mostly in good ways but maybe re-record some of them? they actually sound like they are recorded on different quality microphones for some of the base voices... (The voice acting itself is great, I'll miss being the Highlander!!!)

What bugs me the most are the hitboxes.

This goes for spears, javelins, overhead swings etc. Also, it somehow feels it is getting worse. One extremely annoying ""feature"" is the ability of opponents to block your swing behind their back when they are starting their swing. It will happen often that the opponent does this without having any idea that you are swinging at him.

Your character customization resets itself and you have to redo it multiple times a day if you play a lot. Arrows are not consistent with where you shoot. There's a white line of where it should've gone and it didn't go there at all. Sometimes arrows don't do damage even though it makes hit noises. you can enter the game and not be the character that you customized. I died twice today to invisible fire pits on a convoy course. It didn't say anyone killed me and I staggered every time I hit the fire pit. Some construction items like ladders and catapults can only be constructed from very specific spots on the items themselves in some maps. It's just a bunch of minor things and I really enjoy this game, but these minor things are starting to get very bothersome, mainly just the projectile inaccuracies and character menu issues. I've been wanting to play chivalry for about ten years after watching it for so long. I got the game and am surprised that this company is willing to sell a game with such obvious issues and not fix it. Great game though, just have to take a break every few rounds to stop being frustrated.

The scale of combat in this game feels just right. Although there are only about 30 people on each side, the map design, sounds of swords clanging in the distance and overall chaos when fighting people makes it feel like you're fighting in a large scale battle similar to Mount and Blade. They really nailed the feeling of medieval combat (with added humour to boot).

My only gripe about the game is that the only modes available at the moment are two sides fighting each other similar to a typical Battlefield match. It would be cool to have a story mode with this style of hack n slash combat. If not that, a horde mode would be interesting as well.

They added battle passes in this game with the Winter update and I'm not sure what to make of it. In the past, you could either pay real money to buy in-game skins if you didn't want to go through the hassle of levelling up to the unlock level of the item. It was not a requirement, though. With the battle pass, you do have to pay for the items. They seem to be following suit to Halo Infinite in terms of battle passes: they will always be available to purchase long after that season's over. You can choose which one you want to level in the future.

In terms of player numbers, a lot of people play this game. It's cross-platform, so Steam numbers aren't really accurate. Even if the game had 0 players, it could still be a fun experience with bots. In fact, I enjoy playing against bots & players as it has this League of Legends-type of feel. When you encounter another player, it is difficult to end them, but bots in high numbers can also be a threat. Individually, bots are easy to fight, though.

I give the game a 10/10. Very few games like it on the market. Mount and Blade Bannerlord didn't really scratch the itch for me: that game had a lot of time-sink qualities to it. This game brings you straight into the action.",1680210801,1680210801,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Trebuchets too, siege rams could learn some improvement with Mount & Blade Bannerlord II where you could push the ram yourself. Mounted combat is somewhat buggy, but it's fun. I think Chivalry 2 could also release a paid DLC, something like Chivalry 2: D&D Frenzy. What is great about Chivalry 2 is how simplistic things are. There is a way of incrementing what we already have = adding JUST ONE more skill. Make it through D&D classes. The classics. Paladin heals, hunter's mark, Barbarian rage, cleric inspires. Make it simplistic though, just one skill would do it. Make it expensive also, I wouldn't mind paying for it. Anyways.

pros
-there's minimal grinding for gear, so you start on a fairly even playing field (not pay to win/grind to win)
-controls make sense and is easy to pick up, so you're not at a huge disadvantage against someone with 300 hours in the game once you have like 5 hours under your belt
-maps are well-designed for the most part, very beautiful and make you feel like you're in an epic battle
-cleaving off someone's head with a battle ax is extremely satisfying

cons
-archers (cowards, fun to kill though)
-projectiles in general (fire bombs, catapults, etc)
-a few maps have really lame objectives (either they're too easy for one side or just relatively boring)
-the devs haven't gone brazy enough with their maps/objectives -- i'd love to see something truly crazy in one of the maps, like maybe the final checkpoint is killing a dragon or some crazy shit like that, it's a game, might as well go wild!
-most people can't play as a team and will leave you hanging at the worst times, don't rely on ANYONE unless you're playing with friends
-ONLY UP TO 4 PLAYERS IN A PARTY?!?!?! this one is so dumb, hope they expand the party size ASAP

The player count is stable and there's no shortage of new players, but don't expect every playlist to always be playable outside of peak hours.
Fighting is fun of course but it has weird collision issues where enemies swings can go through you and miss (or so it seems). This, ironically, can get you killed.

Regardless of how good you are you will be relying on your team. Unfortunately, the game is in dire need of a team balance system. Sometimes there will be several triple-digit level players on one team and none on the other. You can guess which team will win 100% of the time. In this scenario you're best off either quitting and finding another match, or trying to swap teams. Sure, the game can be fun while losing, but the situation puts a damper on things [i]even if you're on the decimating team[/i]. It simply isn't as fun as having a close and balanced match.

Speaking of unfair situations, for some reason lagging players have a major advantage. When they lose connection they become invincible, continuously walk forwards, then teleport back to where they were. It's pretty ridiculous when you and a teammate are chasing down a player who proceeds to demanifest, reappear behind you, then kill you. I'm really not sure why the client gets to tell the server where the player is after lagging rather than the other way around but what do I know.

Some of their servers are just you, and sometimes you get sent to a server across the nation with a horrible ping for a match. Be prepared to be matched with people 300 to 600 levels higher than you in almost every game type. There needs to be more level balancing. The main thing that makes this game interesting is the customization. They also have three different emote wheels, leading to many fun interactions with the community. The combat system is my favorite fighting-style game I've ever played. There are three different attack types and alt attacks. If you see what your opponent is throwing, you can counter it infinitely if you do it right. However, each weapon has a different range, wind up, and damage. Learning new weapons and how they feel allows you to get much extra game time. Lastly, I would like to mirror some of the other reviews. Don't pay the full price for this game; it may be fun, but the player base has been here for years, and as much as I would love to see other new people, the game isn't worth the price.

-Ducking costs no stamina, makes no sense, everything else does, but squatting wearing a 100lbs of armor and weaponry, nope.
-Matchmaking non-existant, hope you're a fast learner, you're going to go up against lvl 1000 people with 500hrs in the game at level 1.
-Hit-detection is wrecked, even though the game is years, swings don't connect, players block attacks on their back even though they are facing the opposite direction.
-The developers add some new maps every once in a while, unfortunately, the latest map is an absolute FPS destroyer, very poorly optimized.
-For some odd design choice reason, your weapon, if it's bladed, will pass through the enemy unencumbered, even though it doesn't kill them, just does damage.  Which is fine, however the same does not happen to allies.  You can swing with a fully charge sword the size of an ironing board and it will not pass through friendlies, which makes being around team mates a liability.
-Fire bombs are thrown and don't explode
There is a holdout map, Coxwell, that has been ""fixed"" at least 5 times that I've seen.  It's not fixed, it has never been fixed.  At this point I don't expect it to ever be fixed.

[h1]Bad[/h1]

❌ [b]No matchmaking[/b]. I thought this wouldn’t be a big deal for me personally as I spent so much time on the first game, but the prior experience I had did not do me many favors. Frustratingly, a lot of the time when I responded to an incoming attack using the muscle memory I had from the first game, my character did not do what I expected them to and I ended up dying. Blocking and recovery don’t seem to work the same way at all and I honestly can’t be bothered to relearn an entirely new combat system at this point just to have a small chance against the Rank 853 turbonerds.

❌ [b]FOV is hard capped at 120.[/b] You can’t change it with console commands or by editing config files like you could in the first game. Overall, I guess you could say this is a good thing since it puts everyone on a more even playing field (not really though since there’s no matchmaking, kek) but 120 still feels extremely claustrophobic and makes it hard to play optimally when you can’t see enemies approaching from your sides.

❌ [b]Coat of arms customization from the first game is gone.[/b] Overall there’s a lot more customization, but they’ve inexplicably got rid of the ability to create a custom coat of arms. You can’t even change the color of your FFA outfits. I don’t get this…

❌ [b]64-player servers are once again the main focus, and they’re a mess.[/b] Mordhau tried to make it happen, failed miserably, and now Chivalry 2 seems to be following in their footsteps. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who enjoys the chaotic, laggy mess brought about by 64-player servers in games such as these. There are other gamemodes too, as well as a 40-player alternative, but these take longer to find games for — speaking of which, the 3v3 gamemode is dead. It sounded interesting and I wanted to try it, but after waiting 5 minutes for a game and not finding any… I had to call it quits.

❌ [b]Toxic playerbase.[/b] Who's surprised? Because I'm not. I actually found it hilarious that in my very first online match, I, a Rank 2 player, got stomped on by a Rank 400 who then proceeded to t-bag my corpse. A few games later, I saw another player teamkill some poor dude repeatedly because they ""thought it was funny"". When they tried to votekick him, everyone just voted no and let it keep happening.

[h1]Good[/h1]

✔️ [b]Does chambering better than Mordhau[/b]. Basically, if you want to counter an enemy’s attack by mirroring their attack (i.e. chambering), you have to assume a defensive stance first by holding RMB. I found this much better than Mordhau’s system as it makes it easier to predict that your opponent might be trying to chamber your attack, therefore making the mechanic much more balanced.

✔️ [b]More customization[/b]. You can now change your character’s gender, face, voice, hair, and facial hair. There are also titles and some other stuff that I thought was pretty cool. Well done.

✔️ [b]Good RP elements[/b]. Just like the first game, there’s plenty of potential for fun roleplaying with all the emotes and voice commands. They’ve even brought back a lot of the voices from the first game which is nice.

✔️ [b]Good optimization[/b]. Despite my complaints about 64-player servers, I was surprised by how smoothly the game ran on an RTX 3070 and Ryzen 7 5800X. I didn’t experience any stutters or frame drops and I had smooth ~150 FPS in almost every map. Some maps are a bit laggier than others though, but that was also true for CMW.

✔️ [b]Good graphics[/b]. If you’re someone who’s into good graphics in games, well, Chivalry 2 doesn’t disappoint there. The game looks really nice, there’s no denying that.

In conclusion, despite any of the positives it may have, I can’t recommend this game in good conscience simply due to the lack of matchmaking as it makes it nearly impossible to learn this game. Well, I suppose you still can, but you're not going to have much fun ""getting gud"" while players with much more experience in the game stomp all over you. If you’re willing to put up with that, go for it. Otherwise, it’s a no from me.",1678117979,1678118564,False,6,0,0.581756174564361572,0,True,False,False

No drags and accel bullsh*t though so that's something i enjoy.

The structure of the progressive invasion stages and the combat flow around it is superior to all but Mordhaus best invasion maps, the voice banter is GOOD, but Mord is 12/10 incredible and they were never gonna beat them at that, especially with the new dlc voice pack from Mord.

There are hackers and its hard to deal with, harder than on mordhau, restricting the numbers of archers possible on your team is a great feature though. 

The customisation system is sinfully bad compared to Mordhau. I have my issues with that game but much less than this one. It's a MTX crap show and i don't like it, Mordhau did it better, charging full price for a game means you don't get to lock cosmetics behind paywalls.

Get it if its cheap, OCE users will suffer gameplay wise as there are dedicated servers but not many and they lose pop late at night, but then again so does Mord.

At first you may find it fun but eventually getting constantly body blocked, interrupted and hit by your team mates from behind gets old. Defence is horrible unbalanced as to make the game a chore. Players constantly switch teams and stack Attack because of this, which makes the problem even worse.Why even let players do that? The combat also is not great. It becomes a gank fest because of the horrible spawn wave system or just a stam battle. When you do get hit it's because the visuals don't match what's actually happening. A lot of animations just seem to be missing. People counter into an alt swing and all you see is the parry animation....and then accel hit. On human benchmark.com my avg reaction time is 160-170ms depending on the day. This shit is unreadable sometimes. My ping is often less than 20.  Hitboxes are horrible too. You get hit like 180 degrees from a horizontal. Overheads hit you when they visually look 3 ft to your left/right. Then on the flip side you can overhead or stab into someone and not get a hit. I think my biggest issue with the game is the animations and the fact that they fundamentally make the game unfun for me as it often feels like a guessing game if someone is parrying or attacking me. All classes and weapons basically die/kill in 3-4 hits which is quite stupid when you consider class differences in stamina and speed and same for weapons. No headshot dmg on melee means there is no point to aim at head which means ""matrix"" is quite a bit hard as everyone seems to be slightly looking down the fuck with the animations. I've played Chiv1, Mordhau and now this and have to say it's quite insane how the problem with ALL these games is the animation system and after all these years there has been no improvement. I would actually say it's worse.

This game is easy to pick up, but there is plenty of space to get good as well.

Maps are slight blemish on the overall game as they are a bit steamrolly and are easier for the attackers, but a significant amount of defender maps are designed with the final stage defending a king, and the top defensive player gets to be the king, and you can indeed sometimes single-handedly carry your defensive team in such scenarios, despite what would otherwise be a steamroll",1676604613,1676604613,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

________

the game is far from perfect when it comes to bugs etc but is enjoyable regardless. i would say that the developer does a good job of making changes based on community feedback, regardless of whether the changes are ultimately well received, or the timeframe involved. 

there is no cross platform party system, even to other PC platforms like gamepass or epic, which is unfortunate. and definitely not to console. so just be aware that youll be relegated to matchmaking in the server browser to efficiently coordinate. 

this is a game where you will have to rely on your own wits and situational awareness to stay alive, team balance is not really a mechanism that is functional. 

i would encourage players to not only do the tutorial but actually learn what its trying to teach you. it will make you a better player, even if its not a complete tutorial. it will genuinely put you ahead of a lot of the game.

[h1]🎮 Gameplay[/h1]

[i]Chivalry 2[/i] offers you an opportunity to experience all the grit and gore as if you were a medieval soldier caught up in battle centuries ago.  Players can select a few different modes to play, mounted, mixed or 1v1/3v3. In a normal mixed game, two teams of 32 players face off on a variety of different maps, each with its own goal list and introductions. Each map has unique goals that must be achieved by the end of a timer by the attackers.
  
Combat is fun and exhilarating. You can choose between four classes of infantry, and weaponry for each class. Each selection will have different benefits to your combat. The stamina mechanic allows you to sustain quite a few attacks before you get mauled, which I found was a nice way to reflect real medieval fighting (ie. Exhaustion is the main weakness). After dying, the action is just a short distance away from your respawn, so you can jump back in – literally. [i]Chivalry 2[/i] does not give in to the trope about medieval armor being really heavy and burdensome. In the game, you are able to sprint, jump, kick and dodge attacks, all off which requiring a small amount of stamina.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933694003

The learning process is very simple and straight-forward. The tutorial is quick to complete, and you can see the controls again anytime by pressing F1. You will, however, be mashing a lot of keys, so a good gaming keyboard is recommended. 

Gameplay is very inviting and fun, and [i]Chivalry 2[/i] does a good job at offering a realistic medieval fighting experience to players. I do, however, think the decision not to use more historically based factions and battles was a detracting factor, although minor. Real factions and battles would have made [i]Chivalry 2[/i] stand out incredibly amongst its cohorts. There is lore but I have not dove deeply into it, it has no impact on the game, as there is no single-player story. Each map is paired with another to represent an ‘eye for an eye’ type of feeling. If the Masons attack Agatha in one map, the next map will have the Argathians getting their revenge. There are over 15 maps that you can play currently.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933691695

You can create a party and play with your friends, but there is no in-game clan feature or way to add friends (without adding on Steam). Cross-play is available for those who want to play with friends using different platforms.

[h1]💻 Graphics[/h1]

Visually, the game looks spectacular and is very detailed. Buildings are especially well done, and for the most part historically accurate. Small details, such as fire animations and dust are also are very nice. Each little detail further adds to an immersive experience.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933271145 

Building destruction animations play out very smoothly and also look amazing. Although it would be nice if more things were destructible.

I do not have any recommendations, apart from adding some more armor-coloring options.
[h1]🎶 Sounds[/h1]

Every sound you would expect to hear on a medieval battlefield is present in [i]Chivalry 2[/i]. Each slash or block makes a different noise. Crackling fires and the screams of dying soldiers fill the air almost constantly, with catapults or ballistae adding to the symphony of war. Could be improved by adding more background screams from “peasants” and barking dogs/hissing cats. Also, if [i]Chivalry[/i] had used real-life factions, different languages would have been a bonus.

[h1]👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Audience[/h1]

[i]Chivalry 2[/i] contains strong violence, decapitations, mutilations and gore, which make it mostly unsuitable for younger children or more sensitive people. 
It is aimed at people who are interested in the Medieval Era.

[h1]🔥 Performance[/h1]

System: Gigabyte G5 KD (11th Gen i5 11400H + RTX 3060 6GB 105W)

I was able to play [i]Chivalry 2[/i] with ‘Epic’ graphics settings at a maximum of 90FPS stably (I personally limit to 70FPS with PL1 40W, PL2 45W and Turbo 28W on my CPU to keep temps in 80s) at 1080x1920 resolution.

I did not encounter many bugs, although I had the occasional crash. Every time I exit the game, the Unreal crash report comes up but it does not affect the game in any way.
[i]Chivalry 2[/i] is quite demanding, but can be played on weaker systems as long as graphics and effects are set to a minimum. If you are using a gaming laptop, make sure it is elevated and cap the CPU wattage if temperatures are concerning. 

[h1]❓ Conclusion[/h1]

[i]Chivalry 2[/i] is an excellent example of medieval warfare, and will keep you occupied for many hours. But this comes at a cost, as [i]Chivalry 2[/i] is priced at 40USD. I would recommend waiting until the next 50% off sale. The developers are constantly updating the game and there is an active Discord community, so you do not need to worry about the game becoming inactive any time soon.

[h1]✅ Overall rating: 8/10[/h1]

I figured out very quickly that Chivalry 2 was unfair, unbalanced, unconcerned with status, and unconcerned with whether individual skill is given room to change the outcome of a battle. Players can freely swap teams to get out of a losing situation and start kicking their old team in the teeth. If you find yourself in a 1v1 and hold your own for a bit, the enemy will ignore everyone else on your team to single out the distracted guy fending off his death, and jam a free spear into his undefended, unbaptized bits. Sometimes a catapult just obliterates you for 2550 damage with no hope of counterplay.

This is a big dumb meatgrinder where you beat other players bloody with swords and hammers, to unlock more swords and hammers. You run in and die, repeat, and every bit of the game's design acknowledges that it's meant to be this way. You even respawn freely at a full sprint and are equipped with loud, hammy, extremely-committed battle cries.

And you know what? I could cry tears of f-cking joy that they still make multiplayer games like this. It doesn't care about being esport material where celebrity-hopefuls have a ladder to climb, or whether it's watchable on stream. 

It's betting every dollar it has on the idea that if it hands you a warhammer and lets you flatten Brave Ser XxKushSniper69xX like a soda can, then you, the player, will be having carefree, selfish fun... and then it gives you 31 other knights to try and clobber, because that's 31x as much fun. Yeah, it's messy, but I have so much fun just trying to bonk the guy in front of me that I don't care at all who wins, I'm just glad to have fresh skulls to crush.

Yes, you'll almost always see one team losing badly to the other, even on something as unstructured as an open-ground team TDM battle. It's okay to be bothered by this, but personally I don't mind this even when it's my turn in the washing machine full of knives. I find this adds drama and a personal element to these matches, where it's much more satisfying to send a plate helmet clattering across the floor when it belonged to a complacent knight that thought everyone on my team would go down so easily... 

...this goes doubly for when you corner one of those much-hated archers, where they'll either win back some small dignity by putting up a decent scrap with their backup weapon, or die shamefully with a bow in their hands and piss in their grieves. There's just something about swinging a cannonball of a mace into to an enemy that's EARNED your wrath.

A couple more quick pros: as implied earlier, there's a progression/unlock system to offer you more options as you play, and the melee system is great, even if it translates kinda predictably over the net. Maps are ASTONISHINGLY gorgeous with some of the most beautiful mosques and churches I've seen in a game, and they rotate quickly without much downtime; everything about this game is constantly pushing you back into the fight for another reckless charge.

Overall, 10/10 for dumb multiplayer fun. I wish more online games were confident enough to implement a fun, simple concept and be content to let the damn thing breathe.",1676154580,1676237491,True,175,19,0.903980255126953125,1,True,False,False

Edit 2: I'm flipping back to not recommended. There are some serious bugs that need to be worked out. Every other game, literally, I run into a spawn bug where I do not respawn for 2+ minutes. Sometimes after that two minutes I am kicked from the game unexpectedly. I've unistalled and reinstalled, verified game files. Do no not know what to do. 

There is also an invisibility glitch where some characters on Fall of Aberfell are invisible.

This, in conjunction with some balancing issues from below, warrant my not recommended for the money.

Edit: I am changing my review to recommended after about double the hours put in. Watch some tutorials on how to play, find a few people to play with, and this becomes a better experience.

This game is very fun and very well-made. 

I'm not recommending it because it is a multiplayer game that desperately needs balancing. Frequently one team or the other has a huge load of level 200+ (which takes at least 300 in-game hours to achieve) that absolutely steam roll 90% of the lobby. 

There are levels for a reason. The game shouldn't put level 19s with level 400s. Tiered matchmaking would make more sense (placing players with levels 25 above and below their own level, for example).",1671572644,1676173621,False,0,0,0.510843396186828613,0,True,False,False

Let me start with how the game scammed me only 5 minutes in. Since I bought King's Edition, I got 2000 crowns. So I went to the store to see what they can be / should be spent on. There wasn't much, but one of the products had no description or any disclaimers, the ""Winter Pass"". So I hover my mouse, no info. I click on it, and the game tells me politely, that I had purchased it. No conformation, no warnings, just took 1000 crowns.
Got pretty mad as I had no intention at all to buy it, I only wanted to see what it was. After I looked it up, I realized it basically unlocks everything in the season, which I could have otherwise unlocked by just simply playing. If I knew this, I would have never bought it, but there is more.
After I spent ~12€ worth of crowns on something I had absolutely no intention buying, it turns out NOTHING GOT UNLOCKED!
I posted about this on steam forums and it also turns out I was not alone.
Contacted the developers, but after 24 hours I just asked for a refund.

The game itself seemed good at first but many times the same problems come up that happened in the first game. You attack but it doesn't land even though you were close and the animation finished, using bows still feel slow and unrealistic.

[h3]Summary:[/h3]
This game is the pinnacle of medieval combat. Fight in a war, desecrate a relic, kill pagan religious leaders, abduct peasants and pigs, decapitate an archer who didn't respect your greatsword, blow up trebuchets, kick people off bridges, commit regicide, get launched out of a catapult, kill someone with bread. If you believe it could exist in the medieval combat setting, you can probably achieve it in this game. With combat presented in 3rd or 1st person, and a complex but fair control orientation, the grueling lows of getting absolutely destroyed in 1-on-1 combat are completely erased by seeing heads, arms, legs and everything between go flying as you mow through the enemy forces. The boards are incredibly detailed, with huge intricate stories interwoven into the game play directly. 

[h3]Pros:[/h3]
The game is a pure spectacle of gore and violence, and allows for the player to be completely engaged with that as up close and personally as they desire. The combat presents a complex, fast paced rock-paper-scissors type countering game that has easy work-arounds through either positioning, feints, or the well timed kick. The game has an absolutely humongous weapon set, with everything locked behind progression, which feels spectacular. The cosmetics are also largely available through progression alone, which provides for a very satisfying capacity to customize the presentation of each character. The classes and sub-classes, with their own distinct weapon sets and progressions provides consistent engagement with the larger progression based meta-game, while still improving their distinct paths in fun and unique manners. 

[h3]Cons:[/h3]
The party management/UI is terrible and buggy as shit. The menus are also wonky as hell if you're playing on a controller and have a mouse and keyboard active. The game crashes constantly when its closing, but it doesn't seem to affect game play at all. Cross-play between steam/xbox game pass is doable, but limited, which feels bad. The game doesn't have DLSS turned on as a standard option, so for higher end optimization, check that in the settings. 

[h3]Overall Score: 8.5/10[/h3]
Buy this while its on sale, its well worth the money.

64 player battles can be quite crazy, it is very much a fun game once you learn the ropes of combat. It is always annoying running into level 400+ players as they tend to have combat down to a T and the matchmaking likes to throw several Higher levels on one side, making it a one sided afair

that gripe aside. It is everything and more you'd want from chivalry. Way better graphics, way more fun imo.

Also half of the time whilst I'm in a game I have to look back at the controls. The games weapons are not good too.

Update 7: Devs release stupid game modes instead of useful features, which are missing, like:
- crossplay parties
- ingame ranked play
- capture the flag
- better and bug-free customization
- voice chat

By the way player numbers are now down to about 2000. Most unknown, casual F2P-Games have about the same number of players.

Update 6: Devs released some winter special shit and a battle pass to grab money. Guess what they didn't release: cross play, promised features and fixes for bugs which are present for months now. Also the new winter map has like 3 fps on low settings, even when all other maps work fine on highest settings.

Update 5: Man, the developers still don't care. Same bugs since release, no fix, no cross play, no good game.

Update 4: Big update 2.6 and the promised crossplay feature was postponed to... nobody knows. Steam player numbers dropped from 17000 to 2300 per day, game is almost dead.

Update 3: Two months after the steam release the game still has the same bugs. The workaround to play on dedicated servers is not applicable anymore because there are no players on them. Player numbers are shrinking drastically.

Update 2: About one month after the Steam release the game still has the same problems as in the beginning. Cannot recommend, the devs don't care.

Update: LOL the devs release a big event but you can't play it with your friends because they didn't fix a known bug which prevents you from creating a group.


Initial Review:

The game seems to be fun but it has annoying bugs like you can't party up for some reason - even if both players use steam. I spent a whole day trying to fix this shit and had no success, which is super frustrating. I hope the devs fix it soon.

Only solution is you use dedicated servers (with max 40 players, dog shit ping, and waiting until some dude leaves so you can join - or play on an empty server, lol) OR searching for a game and then leaving like 200 times until you randomly are on the same server. To add some fun: if the game crashes, just do it again! :)",1655564442,1675593280,False,2,0,0.485294133424758911,0,True,False,False

If your looking for a game with a mindless amount of screaming and having fun then look no further.. 
However, if your looking to get serious compared to mordhau or even chiv 1 dont get this game. Its full of desyncing hits and lag... At times it works as intended and can be very fun.. but when you see your sword inside the cheeks of your enemies but causing no damage.. It can be infuriating...
