Boils down to cutting shapes, rotating them, painting them, and then assembling them.

Levels increase in difficulty until its just annoying more than fun.

You play the entire game on one board so you can reuse factories but if youre anything like me you delete everything to start over and make something more efficient/convenient based on location

At first its very addictive and fun as you try to figure things out, then once you understand everything you realize its a very boring and very repetitive game.

Perhaps the most annoying feature is that copy/pasting designs (essential in a factory/assembly game) cost in game currency which is more frustrating than anything. Should be free, no argument.

Found myself alt tabbing/idleing just to get factories to finish the level instead of building massive ones that could do it quickly, no incentive to do otherwise really.

Really no risk to playing the game, you are a godlike camera that can go anywhere and do anything. Nothing costs anything (aside from the one feature which should be free ie. copy/paste)

Overall: If you enjoy a casual assembly/factory style game I guess this is for you but I really wouldnt recommend it to anyone. I got bored quick and found myself playing it just to see if it got more interesting. If you want this game but better and with a real challenge I would highly recommend Factorio.

After initially pointing it out early, if you don't happen to have accidentally made an upgrade available, you can completely ignore upgrades after that point unless you click on the icon.

- Can't not compare it to Factorio - it is a fun production line game.
- Good sense of progression.
- It is challenging enough but also quite chilled out.
- I am 9 hrs in and looking forward to playing more of it.

Cons:
- The game really, really needs a system that saves blueprints, rather than copy/paste only one blueprint at any one time.  I find it baffling how blueprints are the weakest part of the game, when games like this rely so heavily on this feature.
- Blueprints should also be free - the game claims ""this game is not an idle game"", but it is and idle game if you're waiting for blueprint parts to fill.
- Some resources are way too close together and you are sometimes forced to just build on top of other resources to maintain a decent layout.",1706443357,1706444510,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is primarily a puzzle game, with a copy-paste factory mechanic. I can see how people would like this, especially if you've never played anything else in the genre. Perhaps it's a good entry point, but I think not. It misses enough of the key ideas of the genre, and has enough little papercuts, graphics glitches, and QOL issues, that I fear it might turn someone off the genre entirely.

Do yourself a favor, go buy Factorio instead.

The only difficult part of the game is figuring out the obtuse way required to combine a shape. The actual automation portions of it can be solved by simply creating yourself a few template types and copy-pasting the perfect necessary factory. Once you've built the perfect chainable combiner factory, painter factory, paint mixer, each level becomes ""figure out what's needed to combine the shape"" and then just copy-pasting.
Not knowing what shapes are going to be needed in the future levels is frustrating because you don't know what you should tear down and what you should keep.

If you enjoy Factorio you will enjoy this game. (I have never played Factorio but this game is inspired by Factorio and I heard that it's very similar)

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

- Very fun and addicting
- Infinite map
- 10 different machines, each with different variants (You can get more with mods!)
- Wide variety of shapes you can produce
- Colorblind mode
- Many supported languages (yes, this includes English)
- Relaxing soundtrack
- You can build machines without using any shapes/resources, meaning you don't have to grind for 10 hours to build a factory
- Mobile support

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

- For some features, such as mods, you will have to go to a website outside of Steam (I will link all the Shapez websites [b]THAT I KNOW OF[/b] below)
- No workshop support
- Requires brainpower
- May occasionally glitch and delete part of your factory
- May freeze for a few seconds if you select another window and then go back to the game

[h1]Overall score:[/h1]

9/10

I am not a fan of minimalism so if you are this review can be safely ignored but if you find the idea of staring at a light/dark screen with almost no variation in colour all day to be an unpleasant idea do not buy this game. 

Furthermore the challenge itself is weak, it's not a difficult game, but in spite of that they feel the need to lock blueprints behind the 12th level which just increases _tedium_ and not challenge.

While shapes seem simple to create at first, they get much more complex with painting and stacking, and it is incredibly fun to figure out each new logistical challenge. You also have infinite buildings, resource patches, and land, making this an even more chill and minimalist game. (Copy and pasting works differently, at a slight cost though.) 

Of course, comparing any factory game to Factorio is inevitable, so some QoL features that would be nice to have are smart belt dragging (auto place tunnels), side belt loading, flipping blueprints, and a blueprints tab. However, the belt planner and map markers are great tools for building and managing production. Look at all the pretty shapez.

Or the colors. Or the honey. I hope no one can smell my farts. But I can't help it. It is a thing that happens. A thing of shapes and colors and honey and farts.

Sometimes I play this game in my cave, where it is dark and quiet. I like to make shapes and colors that match the seasons. In spring, I make green and yellow shapes. In summer, I make blue and red shapes. In autumn, I make orange and brown shapes. In winter, I make white and black shapes. I think they are pretty. But sometimes they are hard to see with my big eyes.

Sometimes I play this game outside, where it is bright and loud. I like to see the sun and the sky and the trees and the flowers. But I also have to watch out for the hunters and the traps and the cars and the dogs. They are scary. They make me run and hide and growl and scratch. They also make me fart more. I think they are mean. But sometimes they are easy to avoid with my big nose.

I wish I could play this game with other bears. I think they would like it too. But I don't know any other bears who play this game. Most bears are busy with other things, like eating and sleeping and mating and fighting. They don't have time for games. They also don't have computers. They are expensive and hard to use with big paws. I am lucky. I found my computer in a dumpster. It was broken, but I fixed it with some wires and some honey.

I like logistics games. I've played all of them. At least probably the most popular. If I could relate this to something, I'd say Factorio minus realistic world and enemies. The equivalent 'resources' are not finite, but instead finding best spots where 'resources' (in particular, shape combinations) exist that benefit whatever particular goal you're trying to accomplish. In both, you're goal is to build the most efficient delivery of processed 'resources' (in particular, shape combinations) for an end goal.

What makes it not replayable for me is there's no 'sandbox' mode. I've had at least one issue (one is all it takes) where the game file became corrupt. I'd basically gotten to the point where you just level for new random shapes and basically my set up was automated. I am forced to go through the whole game from the beginning.

- Fun and relaxed factory game.
- No monsters or environment, just building nice conveyor belts without minding anything.
- Built a machine that can make any shape, wee.
- Extensive mod library.

Contra:
- Gets laggy when you actually build something, and I am only done with a prototype machine that can merely produce 1 conveyor belt of shapes.
- Copy/Paste of large machines can get super laggy super fast.

In factorio for instance I can feel overwhelmed and a little lost at times, and while Shapez is obviously very similar, making massive and impressive feeling  builds fairly quickly, the next goal is always provided and the tools/machines to do so are more limited and obvious in their purpose. Which takes away the 'what next?' feeling. Also not being eaten and having new bits of the factory destroyed is much more chill.

Overall a very chill and relaxing game for tinkering around with your factory. I really like the concept of not much resource management with just flow optimization in a simplistic art style without any clutter.
The controls are a bit wonky from time to time, but they work fine overall. Finding the right merger in the correct orientation doesn't go as smooth form the hand as I'd desire, but I'm not sure, if there is a significant better solution.
Performance should be further improved as at least for my current factories (which are still operating for lvl4 and lvl5-upgrades) it does not run as good as I'd wish.
Later down the line there might be some depth missing due to the lack of more in depth production chains, but I'm more than happy with the current state.

I don't know if it's the limited number of machines, the constant changes to speed of them (so layouts that did work, stop producing full belts of stuff), the fact that there's just one item sink (like the rocket silo in Factorio) that everything needs to go in (so it's as much about managing space around the hub, as it is about constructing the factory), or is it the fact that you constantly are asked to produce new shapes while making old shapes useless (so you are tearing down large parts of the factory as it's making useless stuff)...

It just feels like a slog, and doesn't give the sense of progression, even when new machines and mechanics are rewards for completing new levels.

My issues all arise from the UI of shapez. I personally couldn't come to terms with these design decisions. Towards the end of my playtime, building and planning began to feel like a chore.

The first thing I noticed was the locking of copy/paste until level 12. It feels repetitive to make any optimizations/expansions before this, as you have to manually place each building repeatedly.

Navigating the variants of each building feels like battling the game. You press the hotkey for the building, then press ""T"" until the desired version is selected. However, the version that initially pops up when pressing the hotkey is determined by the last used version. This leads to pressing ""T"" a variable number of times. Creating pathways using the same structure in different versions is slow because you have to manually confirm each version change. An alternative is to use the pipette, but this requires you to have previously placed the building in the desired orientation and version.

Planning out long paths is made challenging. If you zoom out to check which direction to build next, your planned progress is erased. If you zoom in to verify that pathways align, your planned progress is erased. This results in either planning the entire path zoomed in or fixing any mistakes manually after planning (and ignoring any misalignment issues).

If you don't mind these design decisions, shapez is a great game concept. It offers a lot of depth in factory management and production. Unfortunately, it just was not for me.",1694006004,1694006004,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The rest is just copy & paste upscaling to make more of that shape. Many of the required shapes are one offs - you can delete that part of the factory once you've reached the required quantity. Too much unconnected puzzle solving, not enough automation and optimisation. There is little reward in building a large factory. You can just build a small factory and go play something else while it crunches out the quantity.

The game world is a procedurally generated field populated with deposits of various grey shapes and the colours red, blue, green.
You mine shapes and transport them with conveyor belts to the Hub for collection.
As the game progresses, the type of shapes to deliver to the Hub change, and as you fulfil the deliveries, you gain more tools to manipulate the shapes delivered.
The tools enable you to blend colours, and cut, rotate, colour, and combine the shapes into what is needed by the Hub. 

[hr][/hr]
What used to keep me away from most games like this was the tension of having to monitor your resource usage, and/or time management.
Limited time and resources gets me worried about losing precious materials and opportunities forever.
An aspect i really enjoy about Shapez.io is that the gameplay avoids these stressors, allowing me more freedom to play at my own pace.
There isn't any time limit to beat.
The resources you mine do not get depleted.
This allows one to play without worrying about the cost of building and destroying components of one's delivery system, so you can play around, modify, and optimise your delivery system to your heart's content.
[hr][/hr]
It has a neat, minimalist graphical design I enjoy. The inclusion of a dark mode is very nice.
I don't really care about the music one way or the other, it's not my style, but i guess it is suitable as a background.

[hr][/hr]
Building the sprawling network of conveyor belts and machines, and discovering creative ways of optimising your design - both visually and  logistically - is very addictive and enjoyable.
I highly recommend this game.

I don’t have a lot of experience with automation games, and I’ve found those I have tried to be very “hit & miss”. After multiple attempts I just couldn’t get on with Factorio, but I took to Dyson Sphere Program and Satisfactory immediately and now consider both of those amongst my all-time favourite games. As such, I’m always on the lookout for games with that type of gameplay loop.

Shapez uses a clean and simple interface to take shapes from sources laid out on a large map, process them in some way and deposit them into a central collector using belts. Seems simple enough, but using the methods available, such as cutting, rotating, colouring and stacking, a vast array of intricate shapes can be produced.

The games uses a progression system of depositing different shapes in quantity to unlock additional tools to create shapes of increasing complexity. Unlike the previously mentioned games, there are no time limits, resource restrictions or currencies to be carefully managed. It’s simply the player, the tools and that brilliant soundtrack.

I wasn’t long into the free demo before I decided to buy the full game and it’s soundtrack. It hooked me from the start. Once into the main game I continued with my spaghetti of belts transporting my shapes all over the place, eventually ending up in the central hub by some miracle. Then I discovered ways to create elegant and efficient systems that could be easily copied, like quality pasta (see what I did there?), and it felt like I was playing a different game. Experts of these kinds of games may work that way from the start, but for me it was a breath of fresh air and really opened the game up.

I’ve found Shapez to be an interesting, enjoyable and relaxing experience, with a soundtrack that perfectly compliments a game such as this, and recommend it to anyone interested in automation or logic puzzles. It’s also priced very reasonably.

Standout qualities:
 - Satisfying progression through the levelling system
 - Easy to learn
 - Becomes suitably puzzling to match each level requirement with their unique designs,
      including space and resource 'supply and demand' challenges
 - Simple and clear interface that looks neat
 - Gentle yet elegant sound design

Some shortcomings:
 - Becomes quite repetitive, especially once you know efficient and compact designs. Replay value is low.
 - Given the above, the blueprint feature unlocks far too late in the progression. Manual labour required.

I really wanted to play something like that, so I searched on Google for a browser game and found Factory Idle. It was quite fun, but it required a lot of waiting time. I kept on Googling and searching until I started to feel desperate. However, I finally found the web test version of the game, and it was incredibly enjoyable. As soon as I saw that it was available on Steam, I went ahead and bought the game, along with any related DLC and the soundtrack, to support the developer. The idea of providing a web test version of the game was amazing, and I truly loved it! Even if the game was ten times its price, I would still have bought it.

I've spent six hours playing, and it has been really fun and mind-bending. I particularly enjoy zooming out and admiring the amazing factory I've created in the game.

Overall, I would rate it 10/10. I highly recommend it.

While shapez.io is firmly planted in the same genre of automation and system design, it emphasizes different aspects of factory building and manages to stay totally relevant and fun, even if you're a Factorio pro. Some of the limitations and realism of Factorio have been foregone, but instead of making the game feel weak or under-featured, it just enables you to diver deeper into designs and strategies that are too unwieldy to face head on in Factorio.

Especially at this price point, shapez.io is an absolute must-have. It's just ridiculously good.",1602273272,1684948407,True,1,0,0.505948424339294434,0,True,False,False

This game is more about making something new every time from scratch. Which is honestly a breath of fresh air. Some items or ""shapes"" can be useful in multiple areas or entire factories can be repurposed when a new shape is requires and you were already making something that will help you build the new shape. 

The only downside is the game suffers from slight stability issues beyond level 20. prior to that I was able to let the game run while I was sleeping but after my map become more populated the game becomes frozen if my monitors go to sleep and I have to reset it when I come back. It does seem to maintain counting shapes while it looks frozen though so its a milk annoyance. The game also states its running in 144fps on my screen but I dont feel like it really is.

I want to like this game, I really do, but there are so many QoL features missing that make me want to play other games that accomplish what Shapez.io is trying to do. Building your base is not fun at later stages due to in-game features that seem more like roadblocks than tools to help you progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On it's own, Shapez is fun until the base and quantities start to get bigger. The motivation to keep going is to accomplish the goal of whatever shape is being asked of you.

That's a fine motivation for the first 10-12 shapez, but once you hit 17ish and have unlocked most of the buildings, it starts to become more of a chore than it is an actual game. Ultimately, you are limited to 16 belts of whatever is being asked because of the input capacity of the hub. Belt speed can be upgraded, but there is no reason to have more than 16 belts of a particular shape because it can't be delivered.

Put simply, building your base is not fun. I would hardly even call it a base because of how much changes from level to level. The game does not encourage you to use existing infrastructure to make a product. Everything must be catered to the shape being requested by the hub. It almost seems that this game should have been instanced in some sort of campaign with preset layouts on a restricted map for each level rather than being an open world resource production simulator.

After each level, you need to tear down and replace your base as needed manually or with copy/paste command that is unlocked later. I am going to avoid the word ""Blueprint"" because you never really have a blueprint to reference. It's just part of the base you made and are copying over. That's an important distinction because whatever you are looking to copy MUST be made in your base at least once in the save you are in before you can copy/paste. There is no library of copies, so pick one that is already in your base, make what you need in the moment, or put them far away with a way marker to compensate. The cost to copy is a nice touch and, in my opinion, mitigates any issues that a free blueprint library would bring, but the surrounding mechanics don't make it easy to take advantage of this. 

A lot of small QoL features could make this game much more enjoyable and more engaging such as...
-being able to see belt direction when zoomed out along with I/O of buildings
-mirroring copied items (turns in belts are the greatest offender)
-the aforementioned library of patterns/copied items
-cutting stacked objects remaining small instead of returning to normal size
-some building improvements like a placable delivery hub, quad painter having it's own on/off buttons, or better transport than belts across the map.
-wires. I personally didn't get far enough to see a good use for them other than turning on the multi-painter, but a lot of it seems needlessly complicated.

The game has mod support which probably fixes a lot of these issues, but I question why they weren't added to the game to begin with. I see the similar issues starting to pop up in the dev log of shapez 2. Idk what the dev is going for, but I can think of 3 or 4 other games that does what shapez is trying to do better while keeping players motivated to progress. Not saying that shapez should be copying these other games, but if it expanded on what it already has and improved some of its existing features, I believe it could be something special.

One problem though is that the game says it has colourblind support but only actually has it in some aspects so, if you're red/green colourblind like me you'll find it really damn hard just working out what the level wants you to build. I've had to send a finished resource to the hub just to check if it wanted blue, magenta, cyan etc. If you have a colourblind mode I shouldn't have to still ""trial & error"" it

Devs: The current colourblind support is cool but instead of it just displaying the name of each colour resource please have it display the name of whatever colour the mouse is hovering regardless of what element it is. I can use your current colourblind mode to check the colour of a resource but I would like to be able to hover over each element of whatever design the level wants me to build and it tell me: ""CYAN"" ""MAGENTA"" etc

Shapez is best described as a combination of automation and puzzle. While there are some similarities to Factorio, it is far more on the casual and slow-pace side of things. Each level gives you a certain shape that you have to combine from three different colors and 4 different shapes. As you progress, the required shapes get more complex.

[h1]Who is Shapez for?[/h1]

If you’re looking for a causal automation-puzzle that could also be played as an idle game in the background, Shapez is a good pick-up for you. If you’re looking for a more action-heavy game, this game isn’t for you.

[h1]Are there annoying/negative aspects I should know about?[/h1]

Some game mechanics aren’t really explained in the game, making it somewhat annoying to understand how to get certain shapes. Also, after level 26, every new level has a randomized shape required to advance. So while you could keep on playing after level 26, it does get stale fairly quickly.

[h1]Should I buy Shapez?[/h1]

Honestly, I recommend trying out the (shortish) demo version first. If you like the game, feel free to invest the 10 bucks. Or wait for one of the Steam sales and pick it up for 3 or 4 bucks. The Steam version gives you access to achievements as well as the option to connect to your Itch.io account and play the game inside your browser.

This PC game, developed by Tobias Springer, offers a refreshing take on puzzle games by incorporating industrial design and optimization mechanics.

The gameplay of Shapez is simple, yet challenging. You are tasked with designing production lines to produce various shapes and colors.

But the real magic of Shapez lies in its replayability. With over 150 levels and endless possibilities for custom production line design, you'll find yourself constantly coming back to the game to improve your production output and beat your previous scores.

I transferred one of my desktop saves to the web, spent several hours on it, and it destroyed my save.  At some point while I was playing, it seemed to lose my SSO token (kind of signed me out).  After logging back in, it re-awarded me levels.  But since some levels require one-off shapes that can stop supplying after clearing the level, I lost 6 levels.  So I would have had to replay them to proceed.

Compounding this issue is the fact that the game auto-saves every two minutes on top of your existing save.  Most games written in the past 10 years or so know better than this.  They auto save to a new save.  And most store manual saves separately from auto saves.  So instead of being able to recover before my save game corruption, I was left to either replay the 6 levels or revert to my desktop save.  Neither one is appealing anymore, knowing that the developer fails to utilize proper save game techniques.  

The lack of an ""undo"" feature is equally annoying, since a less frequent or separated auto save would allow a rewind.  I do understand that auto save can be disabled or have its frequency adjusted.  But there are no settings to separate and archive auto saves from manual saves.

Hopefully shapez 2 will have better save game functionality.  

In summary, the game itself is fun.  But the described major bug prevents me from recommending it to anyone else.  This is the first loss of progress I've had with a game that wasn't my own fault since my original Playstation (1) memory card stopped working when I was 40 hours into Final Fantasy VII.",1680391489,1680391489,False,3,0,0.568015098571777344,0,True,False,False

This game has no enemies, no power management, and no build costs. The only thing you do is build and watch your factories go. It's relaxing.. at first.

Don't let this game fool you. At first tasks might seem easy and simple, but overtime you'll see yourself building larger and more complex structures. You'll eventually need to figure out how to make stackable, expandable designs, you'll be tinkering to find out how to produce a shape, and you'll be asked to produce more and more to progress.

I almost would call this a ""puzzle"" game due to the complete lack of survival. All of your brain power goes into figuring out how to build increasingly complex machines, not the best way to set up defenses, or the right resources to focus on.

Overall, this is a great, simplistic factory game that I would recommend to pretty much anyone. It's perfect for older audiences that don't like stress, perfect for young audiences who want to use a bunch of brainpower, and everything in between.

I am a huge fan of puzzle, resource management, and automation genre games and found this to be a great balance of casual and challenging. The game says in the beginning that it is not an idle game, but as someone who currently has to care for their injured partner, I really enjoyed the flexibility of the game to accommodate my need to occasionally walk away. No alarm bells or time sensitive alerts blaring in my ears while I helped around the house, and nothing was on fire when I returned! I know for some gamers, this may not be a plus, but it is for me.

I liked the upgrade system, I believe this helps keep the game adapt to the increasing challenge level as the game progresses. Early on in levels, the upgrade Shapez are often more challenging than the level up Shapez. I Think this is a good thing, as it challenges the player between tasks, and if upgrading was too easy, there would be no reason not to fully upgrade anything before pursing level ups. Great job devs on this balance!

I am currently on level 20, and will not spoil anything. It is the infamous ""Shape"" and it was the first time I had to look up a little help online to make something. I watched the official walk through with the dev and greatly enjoyed the passion behind the voice. This is truly a project with love and care behind it. In that video it is stated that Lvl20 is the ""last level"" and I certainly hope not! I plan to update this review once I am past it.
Hopefully there are new techniques to figure out and challenges ahead, because I could play this forever!

Overall, I would Strongly Recommend this to fans of the Automation/Resource Management/Casual 2D gaming community, as well as my friends. What sets this game apart is the pace.

This game does everything Factorio does, but cleaner, simpler, and presented in steps that guide you in the right direction if the ""sandbox"" nature of it bogs you down with too many choices.

It's very easy to see what steps you need to take next, but there's no reason to rush through each level.

I think it attempts to prove that you can actually reduce all of the concrete concepts (like circuits) in games like Factorio down to just an abstract grind (with abstract shapes) and still have just as much fun. I don't think they're right.

In games like Factorio you at least get a sense that you're progressing toward something. In this game.... it's literally just the conveyor grind.

Shapez is a top-down 2D automation and factory building game developed by Tobias Springer and published by tobspr Games and Doyoyo Games. The premise is simple; you extract materials and build factories to build and paint shapes, than deliver them to a delivery hub to progress to the next level or unlock upgrades. This map is seemingly infinite, fulled with varying nodes of shapes and colors to extract, with plenty of empty space to build your factories before you send the products off to the delivery hub.

This game is simple to learn and the further you get in, the harder your ingenuity and efficiency is tested. You start off a new game with the camera centered on the hub, and a simple task to accomplish before you progress to the next level. The levels progressively get harder and introduce new mechanics with each level you complete. Mechanics such as cutting, rotating, stacking, and painting will allow you to produce more complicated shapes. You can unlock upgrades that speed up processes like painting and cutting by delivering other unique shapes to the hub as well. The addition of the Puzzle DLC and mod support leaves plenty of other options on the table to play with. Replayability is not an issue at all with this one. 

There's really not to much I can say about this game. It's a simplistic game that's easy on the eyes. It sounds alright, and controls great. I suppose my only gripe would be the music that plays as you're in the game. It's the same song on a loop, which can get under your skin after awhile. Despite all of this, Shapez is a great, inexpensive little game for those looking for a mental workout.",1674411538,1674411538,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's very easy to fly in and out and get the lay of the land. And there's not much limit on space so you can decide how you want to be efficient. I liked to spread out so I could progress without having to fret over making extremely space efficient designs. 

The best part was getting blueprints (which allows you to copy and paste whole areas) rather early on in the game. So I could design machines: painteries, mixerizers, combinators, cutting stations. I could change and redesign them. When I needed a new complex product, I'd plop down blueprints of each these as needed and then do a little custom work to tie it all the together. Run a conveyor belt to the drop-off point. Done.

Making new designs was easy too. I'd make a modular segment and copy paste them together until it was enough big enough to match the throughput. New designs created in a fraction of the time.

It's a bit like Factorio or Satisfactory but pure logistics. There's nothing narrative about the products (like technology for survival/escape or goods to deliver to a corporation) but that was always an illusion. Shapes strips everything down to the essence of the genre. 

Good stuff. A+

My only gripes are minor, though they could arguably contribute to the game's character:
- The world is micro-random, to the point where there's no character or landmarks... Abstract, infinite, and lifeless.
- Coupled with the above, there's no real 'existential' challenge, short of how much time you care to spend on it. No monsters will ever invade, no resource constraints, and no cost of expanding too far (except using the clone function costs resources... An odd, if welcome design choice)

Shapez is a factory building game, no enemies, no cost to building, no time limits, you pretty much pick up and go and start building. Your goal is to deliver shapes to the main hub, starting as basic circles and squares, then half circles, then colored, and then mixes of the shapes, The game is pretty fun as you can build, destroy and then rebuild again, without any cost and not having to worry about anything. 

The major Con of the game is it does lose it luster after a while because once you starting building complex shapes, you then have to build other complex shapes, but if your someone who like Dyson or Factorio, and want a simpler version of those game, this is def the game for you!

    big fan of Steam, spend all my time on there

    start playing, and it's great

    as I progress through the game, I start to notice something strange
    the shapes in the game are starting to look familiar
    like I've seen them before

    keep playing, and the realization hits me
    the shapes in the game are me

If you are a beginner at any form of automation game and are struggling to grasp the basic fundamentals...
If you enjoy or are best at learning through problem solving and hands-on experiences, and absolutely adore logic puzzles...
Buy this game.
Buy it immediately, if you have the money to.

With that out of the way, shapez.io is a relatively simple automation game that gets increasingly complex as you continue to play it. There are a variety of shapes, as per the game's name, and your goal is to take apart, put together, color and fuse these shapes together and ship them to your hub in order to upgrade it and further your progression.

While there isn't any ""main objective"" outside of reaching the next level to my knowledge, the puzzles you're presented with when you play are incredibly engaging. Not only that, but they also provide you with a basic understanding and will test said understanding as you continue to go up in levels, adding tougher and tougher challenges to complete in order to unlock certain things.

One of the big things about it that really hammers down why I say this game is perfect for beginners is the things that are intentionally held back from the player at the beginning, such as blueprints and copy/paste being locked behind Level 12. This is what hit me with a realization that genuinely taught me something about these types of automation games - that being to start ""messy"".

What I mean by this is that you shouldn't concern yourself with making things look pretty or organized from the get-go - you should be setting down your foothold as soon as possible. Don't worry about the specifics - just get it working and start stockpiling as soon as you're able to. Once you have basic resources settled and stockpiled, that's when you can start to organize. Trying to ""save yourself time later"" will actually hurt you in the longrun due to the constant rebuilding and organizing, and you'll end up taking much longer to set up than you really should.

So. With all that said... You should play this game, especially if you really like automation or want to take your first steps into learning it. It's great.",1667817253,1667817253,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is nice and simple to learn and resembles factory building games like factorio (just the building part). You basically extract shapes and colours from a 2D map and then cut/paint/stack them to form new ""shapes"" that the game asks you to build. You can build any kind of shapes that you want but need to build specific shapes the game asks to progress (and unlock more processors) or upgrade stuff like belt speed.

It starts out simple but it can get really challenging soon if you don't plan well enough. One nice thing is there is no cost involved for manually building and removing stuff - So you can start out as a noob and build crap but remove all that and make a proper factory later.

Overall opinion - Try it out if you get it on sale - Otherwise, better to wait for Shapez 2 which has just been announced and includes all the things in this game and more. If you want to get a hang of the gameplay, you can go to shapez.io on your browser and try out the demo version - That's how this got added to my wishlist.",1667066512,1667069513,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

I mean, I got into projects and more advanced levels, but I did not really master the game's tecniques. And I was even a Factorio player!

A feeling that, as a passionate PC player, I was not having since a long time. Shapez has really resuscitated my will to play videogames!

I got up, laboriously reawakening my atrophied muscles and almost tripping on my years-long beard and the IV drip my family must have put me on at some point in the past. I opened my mouth to speak to him, but he stopped me with a gesture. With tears in his eyes, but also with a composure I could not help but be proud of, he said ""No, father. The shapes must flow."" Then he left home without looking back. My wife, carrying her own suitcase, followed him, sparing me a look full of tears and reproach.

I sat back down, stunned. I took a deep sigh and reopened the game.

I'm tapping out at Tier 8 item for Belts upgrade though. The grey/blue circle with red on top and a white circle on top of that. The result of this one item has just turned me off the game entirely because it breaks its own rules.

I tried making the shape how my logic was going to make it, thinking top layers shrank as you used the merge tool. But to my surprise (wasnt really communicated in tutorials), the layers have 3d depth to them, so so if theres ""space"" underneath, the top layer just slots in, and doesnt actually shrink in size if theres space for it to fit in the same layer. Okay, interesting. Completely fine mechanic, shame the tutorial wasnt clear.

Then I look up the solution from others. And I recreate it to fully understand it. And this solution fundamentally is using the same kind of logic I am (different layer types, but layers on top of others where theres space to ""drop down""), but this time for some unknown reason, it works.

I am monumentally frustrated at this point because I was loving this game, but in my eyes it has completely contradicted itself in what is possible in its own framework. So I have no interest in going futher because suddenly every new shape now carries the risk of ""lol actually this is built in this dumb arbitrary way that doesnt follow the other rules"".

I'm leaving a positive review because if whatever I'm experiencing ""clicks"" with another persons brain, theres no issue here. But from my PoV there is an annoying inconsistency in the rules of merging.",1658260849,1658260849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game does that really well, you have some shapes and colour and you need to create new shapes and colours from those. A simple start that gets expanded on with more complicated shapes and colours needed to be made.
However, what killed this game for me and stopped it being fun was there was nothing requiring me to think more than ""How do i make this shape?"". By this i mean, there was nothing forcing me to be more creative with my factory constructions. In other games the landscape can be fixed meaning you have a set space to work with, or there is something that is going to undo your work if you don't expand properly. In Shapez.io you don't have that fear or constraint. If you need to make a new shape you can just zoom out and look for a new area of the map to go to and build a new factory there piping the output back with no additional worries. 

For me this didn't quite scratch the itch. However, if you love factory games and want a gentler factory building experience then Shapez.io is likely the game for you. And definitely worth a look.",1658043921,1658043921,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a lot of weird flexes in this game that feel unique for the sake of being unique, new features don't get unlocked fast enough to keep my attention, and it is NOT well optimized.

I think that's my summary in a nutshell:  ""Weird flex.""

One problem I have though...

Every time it asks for a new shape, it is in no way related to the previous one. Spend 3 hours automating half blue square, half yellow circles? Sucks, now it wants red pointy with a white square on top. Like now you either rip out everything you just worked for, or you leave it never to touch it again. This doesn't make me not want to play the game, but it does make things feel a little pointless every time you need a new shape. Plus since you have to start from scratch every time, you spend 3x as long building each factory than you do running it. Spend 2 hours automating one shape just to spend 10 minutes running it and then start over again.

A simple fix for this would be to ask for a new shape that's a modification of your old shape. That way you now have to expand and modify your factory, rather than abandon/erase it and start over.

It is very addictive and fun to play, the default levels are quite simple but there is so much room to explore. The Demo is also a neat feature and I think that got me the most to get the game.

The Electric side of the game is also quite interesting. It acts basically like an Arduino and is very expandable with almost no limit. However, there is not an inbuilt denary number system from the Electric side of the game which makes some projects harder to complete, and the intense amount of wiring and machinary required can be hard for some lower end computers.

As you level up the hub, you get new buildings allowing you to construct more complex shapes and more complex shapes are then required by the hub. I enjoyed this gameplay loop as it allows you to gradually learn how to optimize your production and find reusable, space efficient layouts. Once you get the hub to level 26, you have all the buildings unlocked and free-play mode begins, which is my favorite part of the game. This is due to the wires layer, which allows you to use logic gates and virtual processors to essentially program your machines, allowing you to a machine that automatically creates any shape required by the hub. Such a machine is called a MAM (Make Anything Machine), and I really enjoyed creating and optimizing mine.

First, note that my playtime includes at least 150 hours of just letting the game run in the background.  In short, I do recommend the game.  It's fun to plan, optimize, and think through the various levels.  However, this game performs incredibly poorly when you start making a decent sized factory.  I have a 3080 Ti and an Ryzen 9 3900X with 64GB of 3200Mhz RAM and when I try to use the game's ""copy"" feature to copy anything more than a few hundred placed items, I can go to the restroom, call my parents, grab a bite to eat, and browse Reddit for a few minutes before the game catches up.  Without the copy/paste mechanic, this game becomes outright physically painful to play, requiring constantly holding down shift+wasd+LMB to place belts.  I actually had to go find my gamepad to alleviate some of the finger/hand pain I was experiencing.

I know this was developed by a solo developer, and it's far better than anything I could do, so I'm not trying to rag on the game at all.

It's not filled with action, it doesn't have any story to tell, and there's no sex appeal to speak of, it's pure gameplay. You take shapes, cut them up, color them, and splice them together with a variety of machines that you have to use to create given patterns. It looks a lot more complicated at first glance than it really is, once you take the time to understand how everything works. Sometimes you have to spend a lot of time designing a process, but once you get it down you can design a new one that's even more efficient. You can continue to make more and more efficient machines as the game gives you more advanced machines that make things easier while taking up less space and time.

This game is also very technical, so those looking for something simpler might not enjoy this one. However, if you enjoy a good puzzle, this one is right up your alley.

Simple yet effective visuals as well, makes things very easy to understand.

Achieving these different forms gives you new things and shapes to use. You have to cram things in to your limited space, providing a challenge to your peaceful automation.

A visual programming game, in the same vein as Zachtronics games and Factorio, but stripped down to its core components.

Its an amazing game for the price, hours of tinkering to be had to solve all the shapes, get down your modular 'functions' optimise a neat little factory. Once youve completed the levels youll likely still have a bunch of tools youve barely used to further change things up.
 
I can see why some may prefer Factorio, but for me this is a much smoother experience. You dont have to worry about your resources running out, you dont have to think about Biters who arnt all that much of a threat short of starting a death world, you dont have to actually run around, or wait for anything to be built by bots. If any of these mechanics felt good to you then you may miss them, but for me they were largely just irritating and dragged out some of the more tedious aspects of the experience.

[A word of warning though, the requested level 26 shape is tough. As far as I can see it effectively has only one solution (and one line of symmetry for that solution.) I have no idea yet how Im going to work such shapes in to a fully automated factory.] 

Final and important point, this game is also open source as well, so you can feel free to poke around in its code. Which on first look appears to be very neatly laid out stuff, and fairly accessible if you are familiar with these things.",1605380245,1650720274,True,0,0,0.472972989082336426,0,True,False,False

Stays engaging for a good while with always having a next goal to work towards, and the achievements are fun to work to also

Puzzle DLC is less engaging, seems like it could be a game you break out on your phone to pass the time, not necessarily a bad thing, but its not gonna keep you going for hours and hours like the main game does.

Once you get to the free play levels, the motivation drops off sharply though, once you get your make anything machine for the achievement you can just sit back and watch your factory work and thats kinda boring

Not really the fault of the game, since you can't just make infinite concepts forever, but still something to be aware of.

2 hours in I had these words prepared for my review. The game was cute but not interesting enough.

But I knew you unlocked something called wires later in the game, so I decided to keep playing until I unlocked that at least.

Needless to say I'm glad I did. While the shapes you need to produce become more and more complex, the thing that truly unleashed my enjoyment of this game was realizing I wasn't playing Factorio. Everything I built in the beginning was built with the expectation that my resources would eventually run out, and in this game they don't. Splitters everywhere is a bad practice in Factorio. Here it works surprisingly well.

There's all these tiny pitfalls you're likely to fall into if you come from Factorio. Spend some time designing your painting and stacker arrays. If your throughput isn't what you want, add more. Resources are infinite. You can spend a little time doing trial and error instead if breaking out your calculator. The map is infinite, there are no enemies and there's really no need to plan ahead. It's very ""casual"" in that regard.

But if you think that means there's no challenge then you're in for a surprise. 

Two shapes in particular are very weird and require you to more or less solve a puzzle in order to make them. 

Freeplay, which unlocks at level 26, starts generating random shapes for you to produce. You could make a new factory for each level... or you could spend time making a factory that can produce any shape with the power of logic, wires and shape analyzing. A ""Make Anything Machine"" or ""MAM"" for short. A very daunting task at first and when you finally get it working... shapez.io basically becomes an idle game. But watching your factory adapt and make the requested shapes without any input from you at all is incredibly satisfying.

There's also the speedrun stuff I guess... why do these factory games make me do this?
(Yeah they don't MAKE me do it, but having just one (1) achievement locked is torture for me so I ""had"" to.) Speedrunning isn't really why I like these games, but if you do, there's that as well.

There's mod stuff and puzzle DLC too. My playtime as of this review is for all achievements.
I can see myself returning to this game in the future, but for now I am done.

All in all, shapez.io is a factory game about producing and delivering shapes that takes clear inspiration from Factorio, but is in no way in its shadow.

Give it a solid chance, even if you think the earlygame is boring, and don't let Factorio habits influence you too much!",1648979197,1648979309,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This is a very simple factory game. Every level is built to be longer than the last and try's to push you to try pushing for more efficient lines. It does sometimes cause my game to lag when it's auto saving. I don't know if it's a $10.00 game but the length should keep you busy till the next big game comes out.

It is really a perfect game to blow off some steam for a few hours but also still engage your brain, and I highly recommend it.

Simple premise, you have resources to ""mine"" and you extract, transform and load them into a master unit. As you start you're introduced to the small number of basic transform tools.

The real skill in this game is a) learning how to mix the tools to make the required shapes and colours and b) learning space and efficiency skills. You have finite space after each level you're often left with a bit of a twisty-turny mess of feed tubes, however you cannot just delete them as the game devs offer you extra goodies if you can leave feed tubes from previous levels in place to gather more transformed items. All this forces you to think carefully about the finite space you have to work and that's the real joy of this game. Logic puzzles and restrictions, superb challenges.

A great little game and the latest release also offers mods. As an added bonus if you are a coder and want some extra fun there is a whole API, Discord channel and github project that allows you to use Jscript tooling to design new levels and items.

Once you finish that delivery, you unlock a new tool (up until level 20, at least, after which you get random shapes and get to try and figure out how to design a machine that will produce anything).

Oh, it starts out simple enough. Just supply some squares. Or maybe some circles, painted red. But then you get the ability to cut shapes in halves. Or quarters. Or pasting them together.

I have played Factorio, Satisfactory, Automachef, While True;learn, Dyson Sphere Program, Opus Magnum and SpaceChem.
And I will say that Shapez.io is my prefered game for a pure product line maker.

It is clean and lovely presented. The UI is minimalistic and nice. 
There is no hassle of product cost or external threat.  But at the same time, it has clear goals that are easy to understand and with many ways to solve.

Gameplay
You are making different chaps, where the end product are clearly defined. Seen as it is shapes with colors, it is quite easy to understand what to make, and very many ways of doing it. 
You are also using old products to upgrade. This makes old stuff still useful.
It is also nice that everything is always upgraded to the highest, so you don’t have to manually upgrade.

The copy function cost a specific produkt. This is a good way of doing it. Seen as it gives more meaning to your product and value to coping. The cost is not to high, so you can use the copy function for what you want, but at the same time, you will think before placing things around.
Gives more meaning to your placement.

The tools are logical and understandable, kutting, turning, coloring and so one. 

One can also mark the different factori lines, so it is easy and organiced where everything is placed.

This gives a great opportunity to optimize and make product lines that are very satisfying.



Will definitely recommend Shaper.io for people on the look out for a logic puzzler where you build and optimize production lines.

I'm one of those who were attracted by Shapez.io because of its similarities with Factorio. To put it further, I can say that the only thing this game has that is similar to Factorio is its incremental nature (building stuff to get more stuff and using those stuff to get even more stuff) and maybe belts and splitters. 

Don't get me wrong. This game is far from being a bad game. It is very straightforward in his premise: you have shapes that you need to transform and then deliver them to the hub, located in the center of the map. New goals come with new levels, which involves producing other shapes. This requires more complex and better thought out ""factories"".

My problem with the game is that a lot of things seem meaningless. Sometimes you need to scrap all of your starter factory to produce new stuff, which is rather disappointing. Everything feels arbitrary and with no purpose rather than ""transport it to the hub"". Surely in Factorio you can also get rid of old factories, but sometimes it is not worth your time and it's better to just repurpose them. Shapez.io handles the shape thing in a very simplistic way that surely didn't appeal to my taste.

This could be fixed by adding more hubs that players could find around the map, or just having the ability of expanding your hub and consequently the input squares.

In resume, if you want a Factorio-like experience, you'll probably be disappointed. If you just want to relax with a simple and straightforward game with simple graphics, go for it. 

I know I have barely an hour in this game, but I couldn't stand it. Maybe I'll give it another chance in the future.",1645914300,1645914300,False,1,0,0.499909967184066772,0,True,False,False

I just can't heartily recommend it, because for me, the appeal evaporated so completely at a certain point. It's a very pure experience, but in that purity it distills away a lot of things that should keep a game like this interesting.

The first way this game is different from Factorio is that all the belts and things are free. There's no ""you."" You're just a camera, placing any belt or building wherever you feel like. And you don't need to produce anything to be able to do so. This is a fun choice. It's very freeing and relaxing. Your ability to fix your crappy factory isn't limited by the crappiness of your factory.

The other way this game is different is that everything you make is just arbitrary abstract shapes. At first, that seems fine. It's basically the same fact as not producing your own materials, right? Well, not really. What it boils down to is that every production line feels the same. You cut, you paint, you combine. You come up with a design for a combination line, then copy paste that wherever you need another one, which is everywhere. It doesn't need to be any different because it doesn't ever matter what the inputs or outputs are.  The basic schematic is always the same. Then you combine lines with identical schematics and eventually you have the thing you're trying to make.

It was around the third time I was making the same big setup to mix white pigment that I started to feel like I wasn't solving any problems anymore, and I could foresee no end to it. 

You do a little thinking when it comes to finding the best shape mines to use for whatever you need. You do a little thinking with load balancing. But with limitless space and resources, all you're really doing in scaling up the same simple factory patterns over and over.

Is this an inevitable artifact of making structures free? I don't think so. I think an interesting tech tree and varied production processes could result in a game with a lot more flavor and challenge, without turning the player's inventory into a cog in it's own machine.",1644538126,1644538126,False,24,0,0.750441253185272217,3,True,False,False

It's a feature stripped from Factorio and sold as its own game. It is what VR Missions is to Metal Gear Solid. It is that custom level where you stand still shooting bots in Counter-Strike. It is what the starting menu warm-up mode is to FIFA.

If you're not familiar with Factorio, go play Factorio.

If you are familiar with Factorio, shapez.io is not all bad. I give it a thumbs up after all. But be wary of these reviews, they are spinning the game in a very positive light. It is not just Factorio without the context, the resource management, the pollution, the danger, the difficulty, the player character. It is all those things, but that's not all. 

In Factorio, each material represents a resource. They require specific manufacturing steps to build more complex compounds and devices, allowing you to process further in the tech tree and thus the game.

In Shapez.io, there is the cutter, the stacker and the painter. That is all. Each is introduced in the 15-minute tutorial, and the rest of the game is cutting, stacking and painting. Any progress in the game is having more cutters, stackers and painters in conjunction.

Some reviewers are saying ""there's endless complexity in the variations!"" as some sort of replacement for the content found in Factorio. It's true, there are many variations. Each ""block"" is just the titular shapes after all. When playing the game you are asked to build quarter circles combined with a green square combined with a yellow star. Undoubtedly the mathematical possibilities of different shapes are astronomical. There is no complexity to it, though. Manufacturing any shape happens in a combination of cutters, stackers and painters. You might rotate a block differently, or stack from left to right instead of right to left, but the procedure is the same each time. 

This gigantic number of possible variations is of course achieved by having the blocks be entirely meaningless. You're not using them to build anything like in Factorio, they are simply ""collected in your HUB"", so you can open up the pause menu to view how many you have collected. You do get some missions that don't seem to do anything after the tutorial, and a level up mechanic, which basically just speeds up the game. Not ""speed up"" via unlocking features or abilities. Literally speed up by sending a multiplier to the game engine to run faster.

Because there is no context, no setting, no story, no character and no danger, there is also no incentive for the player. You could just leave the game running on its own, and you won't be any further along or in a more advantageous position if you spent the ten hours playing intensively. That might not matter to you, but it's worth mentioning.

That lead me to the dreaded conclusion: this is a game for people who like to ""kill time"". I don't like to kill time. I do it out of my own stupidity or laziness, but I don't seek it out. To me it's like saying ""I like to burn money"" or ""I like to throw away food"". I gain no enjoyment from it.

There is however something in this game that in my opinion pretty much justifies its existence: the Puzzle DLC. I should review it separately, but giving access to the Puzzle DLC is what makes this game worth getting. The Puzzle DLC is very self-explanatory, it's puzzles with limited resources, using the same mechanics familiar from Factorio. It truly is ""a unique spin on the Factorio formula."" So if you're buying this game, get it with the DLC. 

The base game might have some value in keeping your fingers occupied while listening to a podcast or something, but you could also just learn to knit. It's more engaging, more exciting, has more variety and you get socks or a nice hat out of it.

Since it seems to get updates i probably wouldn't have not recommended this but, from what i saw, some bugs havent been fixed for a long time and ill assume the later they avoid fixing them the more likely itll break more existing stuff people made so i somewhat doubt those bugs will ever be fixed.

What an amazing game this is. So simple, but so busy.
The goal here is to build a factory that produces all sorts of shapes in all sorts of colours. You can see the shapes as different food objects, or anything else you can picture.

The graphics are good. Good does not always have to mean realistic. Simplicity is a virtue too!
Considering the simple 2D graphics, it can run on any potato you van think of, with even more settings to push more FPS out!

The game starts simple, and may seem dull at the beginning, but it gets more complicated overtime. You even have the possibility to build computers that automate everything, and create any shape you want. 

For the little amount of money this costs, you get a lot of TOF (Time Of Fun), and you support the nicest developer of all time.

I found myself losing entire evenings to this game and it was difficult to quit until I was able to create a Make Anything Machine of my own design and have it play the game automatically from level 27 onward (up to 518 as of this writing).

Doesn't have the depth of something like TIS-100, but that's because it's a simpler, lower level factory game, not a set of puzzles. 

Speaking of, there is a puzzle dlc but I haven't played it.

There are no distractions in Shapez.io, only the factory and the problem laid before you by the game. 
	You will enjoy Shapez.io if you like new logistic problems to be thrown at you in careful succession but don't enjoy dealing with the ramifications of your old work. In Shapez.io, your old factories can easily be deleted or forgotten by comparison to other logistic simulators. The game can be jumped in and out as easily as a pair of socks or a matchmaking game, with no spin-up to remember, ""What was I doing before I quit last time?"" The objectives are simple and you need not find your own goal.
	Shapez.io can be pronounced as Shapes, Shapez, or my personal favorite Sha-pezeo (saying the whole thing in one mouthful). Shapez.io is a colorful, minimalistic, obvious love poem to Factorio. So obvious in fact, that one of the loading screen tips of Shapez.io is ""Play Factorio! It's my favorite game"".",1636825079,1636825079,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a very satisfying factory-type game with somewhat simple mechanics. You start out extracting simple shapes from your surroundings into your Hub, and slowly start to expand on what shapes you need, what you can do with those shapes, and those then give you rewards to help further expand your factory.

The shapes around your factory are randomly generated, which can either help or hinder your progress as finding the right shape source and how ""perfect"" that shape is determines how complicated your factories need to be, which then have knock-on effects on your throughput (your shapes per second on a given track), there are also paint colours you will have to extract but your throughput is usually determined on the colour source size rather than the random nature of the shapes.

The gradual way in which you unlock the features allow you to get accustomed to how they work, I've not yet unlocked all of the features of the game, but so far I've unlocked the ability to: Rotate, Delete, Cut, Stack, Colour, Merge Paints and Merge Tracks, which all have various configurations you can mess with to create compact yet complicated factories.

There is also a fleshed out wiki that has a bunch of design suggestions if you need advice, and plenty of YouTube videos on the optimisation of your factory. 

It's not as complicated as similar factory games, such as Factorio, Satisfactory, and so on, and doesn't demand a lot of computational power to run properly.

For what it is, it's an experience well worth the asking price.",1636243306,1636243306,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The beginning, where you learn the ropes and unlock the stations -- the idea behind this game -- it's really fun, and challenging. Simple turn ins, in the 10s? Ok. After the tutorial stages, it gets interesting! What's this strange shape I'm supposed to turn in? It's a combination of 3 different mine-able shapes, you gotta decompile them, color parts differently (coloring requires some mixing too), rotate each piece into position, merge together, stack in order, etc etc. The core of this game, the puzzle and logistics behind creating a ' shapez ' , is genuinely really fun.

The part that sucks is ... I spent 10-15 minutes setting up the most complicated shape I've seen yet, that can't... really get too much more complicated with the limited number of shapes and colors in this game... and I'm producing like a quarter of the shape a second. I optimize somethings (split every mining path up a couple times, since the time-consuming is all these little stations, and I can now double those)... and bam, ~20 minutes, I've got this shape now coming out at .5 / sec. Oh wait, I don't need ~3k like last level, now I need 30k. Or 60k seconds, a hair under 17 hours. 

Well, I can do the entire process again. And again. and again. Now after an hour and 20 minutes of solving the same puzzle I've already done before, my wait is a mere 4 hours. At least I'll finally get a new puzzle! Only... after 6 upgrades, up to 1000, there are no new puzzles. It's the same shapes, over and over. That number of turn-ins is the only added difficulty, and scales into tens of millions. There's no new challenge of "" how am I going to make this "" and it's more like ... "" how am I going to spend 20 hours making machines that make this shape, and still have to wait weeks before I can unlock the next difficulty, which is the exact same thing again, but my ramp speed will go from 8.4 to 8.5! "" 

The beginning of this game is really great, the idea is really fun, and I feel like it has a lot of potential. I may leave it overnight a couple of times to unlock the simple upgrades, and then set up a couple lines for the campaign and leave it overnight for the next mission. I can't imagine trying to play it out by making the same ' shapez ' production line tens or hundreds of times, then still waiting hours, though. I feel like if the system replaced "" the tens of thousands, to millions, of the same shape you have to turn in "" to "" several hundred to thousands of a constant variety of shapes "" , ((which wouldn't seem hard to do?)) this could be a real game to get lost in! Instead it's in kind of a gray area of "" a good game, but with some terrible implementation. ""

/edit After playing some more, I think it does have some appeal like an idle game. If you can leave it overnight to crank the higher things, it's not so bad? I still wish it wasn't quite so necessary, but oh well.",1634285888,1634340893,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Shapez.io is like Factorio but without the following:
- Every placeable object is completely free to construct
- (you have no inventory since every building is free)
- Every 'ore' patch is infinite
- There are no obstacles or enemies or terrain

On the face of it, you might say 'well that sounds strictly easier than Factorio,' but: In this game there is no single 'assembler' building but rather multiple smaller buildings that do discrete assembly tasks, and going from raw resource to finished product can involve up to dozens of these tasks. It's like if someone 'opened up' the assembly buildings in Factorio and let you design your own. Also, there are hundreds of permutations of shapes instead of the dozens of craftable items in Factorio. You might say 'okay, we'll think of the circle shape as Iron,' but then - what is specifically the lower-left quadrant of the circle supposed to be? What if it's green? What if it's stacked on top of something else?

Basically, Shapez.io removes resource management and environmental challenge completely, and adds extra complexity in assembly and item variety. In the end I think the two are equally challenging, although I would suggest Factorio for players new to the factory-sim genre.",1631501194,1631501194,True,107,1,0.913401901721954346,0,True,False,False

Awesome modular building game with a good progressing pace.

Throughout the first 40-60 hours you'll find that new challenges keep presenting themselves.
You can make your base as beautiful/ big/ complicated as you like as there are infinite resources on the map which wonderfully enough does not take away from the challenge.

I personally also really enjoyed the achievement hunting in this game.
Without spoiling too much there's a certain machine you'll want to make which will pose a nice late-game challenge. There's also a couple of achievements to sample speedrunning with.

It's an automation game that reduces the scope down purely to the conveyor belt logistics element, and then expands on that with numerous ways to interact with the belt objects - in this case, shapes.

You rotate, cut, reassemble, stack and paint shapes to make whatever the goal is for the level, plus various other shapes that are needed for upgrades. And, really, that's the game. There's not much more to it than that...

...except for the steadily increasing complexity of the shapes, plus the constantly expanding array of tools at your disposal. The game has a perfect learning curve, starting you off with the absolute bare minimum amount of tools you need. When a new one is unlocked, you get an explanation and demonstration, and the next shape or one coming up soon after will require some simple use of your new tool.

The game is essentially a sandbox with objectives; you have infinite amounts of every building, all resources are infinite, and the map scales infinitely in size. And that's the greatest strength of Shapez.io; it goes at your pace. Experimentation is free, and it's easy to naturally play around and discover ways to make your factory more efficient in size or speed. The game gently nudges you towards doing better by steadily increasing the number of shapes per level, but it's still ultimately up to you how optimized it needs to be.

After level 26, you get your final set of tools, so the game issues you one final challenge: build a factory that can make ANY requested shape, without needing to be changed; each subsequent level requires a randomly-generated shape, so doing it manually is simply no longer practical. Figuring out how to do it is a doozy, but it's a fantastic final challenge to the player to really test what they've learned.

If you have ever played Factorio or simply don't have the money to buy Factorio, shapez.io will scratch the same itch quite well with a much simpler art style.

My only single gripe with the game is that you have a 4x4 box which all of your shapes will be delivered to and the game encourages you to never delete your old factories. This creates a massive issue within the first half hour at most in which there isn't enough space to keep your old factories which leads you to deleting them anyway and redesigning them.

In Factorio you can have similar issues of spacing, but this rarely matters in the long run if due to there not being one single ""hub"" in which all of your resources need to be poured; just other factories in which you can choose the location of. In shazpez.io this is not possible and can create some extremely frustrating situations in which you need to redesign literally everything you have created over a certain period of time just to allow for a new item to enter the hub.

This becomes even more infuriating when you then need access to the old item, the one in which you had to disconnect or destroy the factory of as to make room, to progress later in the game (usually in the form of combining the old item with a new one as to continue).

This sounds like an oddly specific gripe to have, but it impacts the game to a massive degree and can lead to dozens if not hundreds of wasted hours in the long run simply because you built your factory off by a single tile.

There are three big problems I have:

1: When you build something and have not unlocked every Tool/Variation of tools yet, you always build stuff knowing that you will have to tear it down later because there will be better ways to do it available. Games like Factorio handle this in a (imo) much better way because the only types of upgrades you get for existing machinery are speed upgrades. New machinery always either belong to different game areas entirely or does not allow you to suddenly half the size of your creation by rebuilding it entirely. This constant ""throwing away"" of your builds really makes it feel like your first (im guessing) 15-20 hours of gameplay really have no use at all.

2: The developer made choice to lock the copy/paste/blueprint functionality to only be accessible later in game. I dont really mind this for blueprints, but not being able to copy and paste in a ""sandbox"" game really sucks. Building stuff, especially in tighter spaces was made extremely tedious due to not being able to just shift your builds over by a few spaces when needed. You are forced to build your stuff over and over again until it fits.

3: Most of the machines you build consist of 30% actual machinery and 70% belt balancing and other logistic stuff. This wouldnt be that big of a deal if it werent for the fact that all of the balancing stuff is pretty much the same in every single production line you build - again, a big help here would be a copy/paste functionality unlocked from the start. I also feel like this issue would be easily fixed by just allowing loading a belt from more than one side at once, like basically every other game in this genre, but that would probably also bring a lot of other design decisions with it that I am not able to consinder so take this point with a bit of a grain of salt.

Now for the good stuff:
- This game really nails its visuals.
- Very good balance between simplicity and mastery of tje mechanics (think: ""easy to learn, hard to master"") 
- Good introduction to the Genre
- The puzzles mode in the DLC is pretty unique and actually a lot more fun to play

Again, this review probably does not affect most of the players, so you will have to decide this for yourself. I also looked over some other issues, like poor performance due to the game being coded in JavaScript (which isn't necessarily always bad, but certainly not the choice for a game of this kind) and some other small stuff, that didn't really affect my enjoyment in any big way. In any way, I still have to commend the developer for making a daunting genre accessible for a lot more people and serving as a good introduction.",1630363953,1630363953,False,11,0,0.637620329856872559,0,True,False,False

The only thing I'd change is add something that helps with space, such as actual modules that shrink a selected mini factory into a single unit. The tips on the loading screen imply there's a feature like that, but I'm either an idiot and can't find it or it's not implemented yet.

Also there are a few computer resource/lag issues, but they're pretty light considering the nature of the game so I can't really fault the devs for that, just something to be aware of as you get further into the game and your factory gets more elaborate. If you're having trouble with it hanging and crashing, try launching outside of Steam, that helped me significantly. Only downside is that it doesn't recognize the DLC if you launch it that way.

General tip: Save often, exporting the save file in case it gets corrupted. Also very helpful to do if you want to try something but want to be able to revert easily if it doesn't work out well.

The large amount of agency it gives the player - combined with relatively simple ideas and mechanics - creates an elegant challenge that will satisfy players of any skill level.  It is both intriguing and relaxing in ways few games are.

In a way, shapez.io is quite straightforward:  You design machines that build shapes, and get those shapes to the central Hub.  The game presents the players with tools, a goal, and very little hand-holding, which is both rare and admirable in modern puzzles.  This creates a wonderful space where the player is able to challenge themselves to make smaller, better, faster machines at their own pace, and to their own satisfaction.  I sometimes found it fun and rewarding to look over old designs with new ideas and find ways to optimize; I sometimes found it fun to try a new idea from scratch; and since the restrictions came from the base mechanics, I never felt overly frustrated or unfairly blocked.

Each time I found myself satisfied in my understanding, the game threw a curve ball:  A new tool with new possibilities, or a new shape combination I hadn't considered, and by the end it had evolved into something that it had been leading up to from the start, but was also somehow surprising and unexpected.  All the way until the moment I stopped playing I was solving mini puzzles in new goals I had created for myself.

Get it on sale though because I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this very simple version of Factorio unless you really need to get stuff on conveyor belts.  Building is simpler and moving from place to place too, quickly you'll unlock things you might be familiar with like underground belts as well as unfamiliar bits like cutting, rotating, cutting again, painting, and finally mashing it all together in the correct order to make the HUB's required design to move-on.  After you beat a level you aren't whisked away to a clean slate with a new requirement.  No, instead you wallow in your own factory of filth and need to continue sending those previously crafted shapes to upgrade your factory.  Things get tangled up and space becomes crowded.  You encumber yourself with your early factories so its really all your fault.  But you can destroy faster than you can build here so no matter.

One lil thing that I really don't like is that the hot bar at the bottom with all your construction supplies doesn't have enough options.

Its a little problem but annoying enough that I hafta tell you about it because you are gonna use the splitter and the joiner quite a lot in this game and more so than everything else except conveyor belts.

I also find that the easiness to change production with all the tools available to you is a big plus.

The levels progressed really naturally, introducing new mechanics and teaching you how to use them. Only levels 20 and 26 required some non-intuitive stacking patterns that the game would be better without.

I liked that the upgrade system overlapped with the level objectives, but was disappointed that it stalled after tier 7 where everything started to require more of the same components rather than a variety, and the upgrade rewards became insubstantial. Worse, those shapes were the most awkward ones from levels 20 and 26, making their production hard to scale.

The level rewards got strange after level 20, unlocking a bunch of electrical components that you didn't need to progress through L26. It seems like they tried to transition you to a different kind of game play (flexible factories) without the natural progression from earlier in the game. I completed L26 and unlocked free play, but still had no idea how to use the electrical components to build this new kind of factory. I think the game needs several more structured levels to get you over this learning hurdle.

~~~ Update ~~~

After a break I went back to this to try creating the build-anything factory. It ended up being a ton of fun. With modest initial goals I was able to prototype a general purpose factory, and then slowly scale it up, work out the kinks, etc.  Eventually I made a second and third copy of the factory that pushed me up to level 234. In theory this keeps scaling until you run out of hub delivery slots (16) which should be enough to put you over level 1000, but there's not much point in actually building that.",1626020817,1626555334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
When I think of simplifying the genre, I always come back to the core concepts of Shapez.io, it's simplicity in style and in function. It's emphasis on ratios, how many items per second the machine can handle in relation to others, encourages large scale factories and production of something as a full flowing belt.

The game features no cost to place buildings, which also encourages large factories. But to use the copy-and-paste features you need the blueprint shape. I ended up building a giant factory that produces 12 belts of blueprint shape by hand to make the later game easier.

You are encouraged to keep old factories, so you end up with a mess of spaghetti belts and chaos if you don't organise things. This can look really cool.

THE GAME IS LIKE $5 AND IT GOES ON SALE ALL THE TIME! You can play it online for free but you don't need to!

Cons:
Shapez.io used to have almost two endings. There was beating the premade levels and fully upgrading everything, and then there was making a make-anything machine. This took a while, and a lot of logistic work. But with the addition of the wires update, once you were done the game would automatically progress. No interaction. BUT THEN an update came out that made it so later levels progressed based off item throughput, and made upgrades infinite. This ruined the second ending. You now had to do the bare minimum of setting the upgrade shapes and pressing upgrade to progress. It's tedious and stupid. It isn't fun.

The music can get a bit annoying. It's good, but annoying.

Stacked miners should be something you get from square one.

Honestly, 4.5 stars. While I love Factorio and more traditional Factory-Builders, Shapez.io is my pick for it's simplicity and enjoyable experience.",1626322194,1626322194,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But then I started playing it. And quickly I realized that the gameplay is a mess. The idea of the base shapes and colours being locked in place means you quickly end up making a big mess of your machines, constantly having to change them to work in the new parts and new goals.

Then you come across the level where you have to build a blue shape, but there's no blue colour in sight. And as it turns out, you have to zoom out to find a blob of blues far away, something the game doesn't tell you, so now you have to build very long conveyor belts between parts of the ridiculously big map.

Others have compared it to Factorio. I have never played that game, its graphics do not appeal to me, so I don't know if the comparison is accurate. But many of those reviews mention it having a sandbox mode. And that is what this game desperately need to be any good. I came into this game wanting to be creative and make all kinds of shapes from base shapes and colours, not having to micromanage everything because of locked in shapes and colours.

This is an amazing automation game! You extract and process shapes to deliver to your hub as the goal shapes get increasingly complex as you unlock new machines to make them. At first it seems like simple cutting and extracting, but soon you will be painting the pinwheel white then cutting it into quarters then fusing three of those quarters back together then painting the other quarter blue then stacking that quarter on top of a semicircle... yeah, shapes can get real complex. There is also some tricky parts, such as Level 20 where you have to make sure one of the quadrants is smaller than the other three (there's no scaler) which requires some hard thinking and work. You can also upgrade your machines to go faster until your conveyor belt becomes a Formula 1 racecar. Buy now, it's totally worth it!

This is an exceptional game at the most reasonable price. I am the type to buy a game, play it for 30 minutes to an hour and never look at it again. It's a problem. I clocked almost 12 hours in one day and I feel I have received more enjoyment/entertainment out of this few dollar game than I have AAA new releases. 

This game really pushes you forward, without being over-bearing. The concept I find wildly amazing is the fact that the devs ENCOURAGE mistakes. Most games often punish you for making a goof-up. This game has no currency (except blueprint shapes to copy and paste HUGE machines.) This essentially means the only investment you have put forward is time and brain power. But the more the game continues, the more you build very optimized, successful machines. The map is never ending, so if you want to keep a junk-pile for inspiration, just keep it!

Soundtrack is amazing!! I can play for 12 hours in one day and bob my head along the WHOLE time. Absolutely perfect job catching your intended vibe. 

Brain power. This game will exercise your mind, if you let it. I am on break from school, and I usually find the idle mind syndrome a bit overwhelming. This game is a perfect remedy to keep your mind active in a light, casual STRESS FREE zone. I can't stress that enough, this game is absolutely relaxing. It allows you to sit back and watch your contraption for a minute. Judge its progress and determine where needs to be optimized (you can always get better lol.) 

I have played this genre before, but have never tried factorio. This game has made me wish list it for my summer break (when I have more time to play.) If I had to guess, this is more of a logistic puzzle game to chill out to without stress, where factorio is more involved. Nothing wrong with that, but I have a feeling this will be more played.

One thing I wish I had been told is that you should be really mindful of how you use your space around the hub area. Part of me is too lazy to redesign the space around it and it seems like a daunting task to finally organize everything.

One small complaint I have is the fact that you slowly unlock each machine part. It means that as you progress, you have to keep redesigning your previous builds to be better and faster.

Despite what you may think, this is not like factorio in many ways.
Factorio is a sandbox of creativity. If you like creativity, you'll will barely find it here. The game is pretty linear and has pretty clear objectives.

shapezio, is a puzzle game, with levels that you progress each time you solve a puzzle. Not a creative sandbox. Nothing like factorio for some of us that don't like this style of puzzles. 

You solve a puzzle, you're done with this factory, go to the next one and make an entirely new setup from scratch. 

What if I just want to relax, and drive a vehicle, kill some creeps, deal with an easy task, improve a bottleneck just because I want to, not because a puzzle forces me to? And that's my point! This is not factorio, it's a puzzle game. Do not play this game with the wrong expectations. You might love this game, or if you come with the wrong expectations, you might just ignore it and hate that you spend 6 dollars for something you realized you're not interested in.

I'm not recommending this game, because I came with the wrong expectations because of some reviews. The game might be good for other people, but I expected something different so unfortunately I did not enjoy it. The fact that I had to rebuilt the factory over and over, and solve very specific puzzles instead of relaxing and do whatever I wanna do like I do in factorio, threw me off. Do not listen to the reviews that talk about factorio, they'll make you not enjoy this game for what it is.",1624642519,1624642704,False,0,0,0.41778254508972168,0,True,False,False

If you’ve never played Factorio or a more complex factory game, and found the genre a bit daunting then Shapez.io is the perfect place to start! If, like me, have experience with the genre then you should still have an enjoyable experience.

I like the progression in this game a lot. Each mechanic unlocks as you progress through the levels, gradually teaching you all the different elements. Eventually you run out of unlocks and move onto freeplay. The ultimate goal is to make a “Make Anything Machine”, that will automatically make whatever shape freeplay throws at you (and the shapes do get harder in freeplay as well, so there’s even more progression past this point).

The game is not very well optimised - not surprising, considering it was written in javascript. This kind of game REALLY needs proper optimisation. Factorio can handle way bigger and complex without as much as a hiccup (*cough* C++ *cough*). Even though the game lags it wasn’t so bad as to be unplayable.

I recommend you pick up Shapez.io and discover the joy of automation!

I don't remember the exact circumstances, but I very much struggled to shut this game down, even after playing well past my normal limits. Again, I want to emphasize that this isn't because of anything malicious done by the developers, but the psychological hooks are still there. If one wanted to reduce this issue, I would recommend putting in more stopping points and even reminders to take a break from playing.

[b]Differences to Factorio[/b]
- There are no power (or monster) concerns - build as many of anything as you like
- Blueprints cost shapes to place
- There are no 'grabbers', so you can't pull items off belts, you have to split everything
- Belts only have one item instead of 2 lanes
- You can't do a ""main bus"" because you need different shapes for everything

- Good background music
- Runs well
- Distils the Factorio experience to simple shapes

The price is great and worth at least twice as much. Knowing what I know now I'd pay upwards of 30 or 40 dollars for this game. 

The music is actually lowkey tremendous and I look forward to hearing it every time I boot the game up. 

The graphics and UI are SO crisp and clean. It's simple, very effective, and easy to look at. Not overtly complex graphics but the style is perfectly crafted and it feels amazing. 

The game play is very zen and enjoyable. There's nothing to pressure you and you can't fail, it's all forward progress. It starts simple and slowly gains in complexity with some real brain teasers along the way. The first thing it wants you to do is use conveyor belts to bring basic circles to the main hub. By level 18 you're figuring out how to stack shapes onto ghost layers and maximizing throughput on your blueprint shape for mega factory copy pasting. WAIT WHAT? It's awesome

WIRES UPDATE?!?! This was a HUGE addition to the game and an absolutely incredible one at that. It's completely not necessary to beat or enjoy the game, but if you are into programming or want to experiment with logic gates, this is a great game in which to do it. I played an alpha version not connected to steam before the wires officially came out. It was a blast! So I actually have about 40 or 50 more hours than what my account suggests. 

You should definitely check out this game for it's amazing content at a ridiculously good price! The dev has even more planned additions to the game in the future like a puzzle dlc which I'm really excited about! 

I was really lucky to stumble across this game, do yourself a favor and check it out! There's a free demo available as well!",1599763545,1619815122,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will say that most of these reviews are misleading though...this is NOT factorio, satisfactory, etc...and CANNOT even be compared to it. 
There's really 2 phases to this game...the first 26 levels, are puzzles...that's it.  You can check out shapez.io for the free in-browser demo...run through some puzzles, see if you like it.  You're NOT building a mega factory, there's no rockets to launch, you're not getting off any planets, etc....you're solving puzzles.  Logically: 99% are simple, however it'll take you hours (overall) to actually design the ""factory"" (I use the term loosely) and optimize it.  If that doesn't sound fun, then you probably won't like this game.
After level 26 you're in ""free play"" mode and the shapes you need to craft factories for are just randomly jumbled mess.  Well, obviously making/destroying factories for quick puzzles is lame...BUT...because of the fairly robust logic/wire system in this game, the end-game goal is actually to make a ""machine"" that can analyze and actually create the required shapes automatically.  Sounds insane when you first start playing, but yes it's possible...and super fun.
If anything I wrote sounds appealing, you'll love this game.  I've gotten probably 100 hours with it already...hard to argue with a $6.99 price on that!",1619589013,1619589013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

progress is made by delivering a specific shape that you need thousands of to upgrade your equipment. this either gives you a better machine or just increases the speed at which they operate, the latter of which can increase seemingly infinitely. its a super simple and extremely addictive factory builder game and its my favorite to date. big yes, do buy.",1619417143,1619417143,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

get this game like it is, you won't be dissapointed!
_______________________________________________________________
First of all, the game itself is great, but I will give a thumb down because of one terrible design flaw which will ruin the whole game.
So before I say something good about the game I want to say the following:
The game has a awful savegame design. I played for 8 hours and everything went fine but then the game crashed during a save. And that's it, everything is gone. If your game or PC crashes while the game saves, it will delete your entire progress and that's my problem.
A savefile should always be kept until the next save progress is fully done. Or just keep always 2 save files. This way you can always go back to the last autosave instead of loosing everything if one file get corrupted.

And now to the good point of the game.
I didn't wanted to play it again after I lost everything. What would be the point of playing a game, where I can always loose everything down to nothing? Especially for a game like this one. It just didn't made any sense.
But... I couldn't. I had so much fun playing it the first 8 hours, optimizing my whole build make everything better and better and develop flexible systems all over my base. It is so addicting. It is like a factorio simplified down to it's essence and nothing else. Relaxed and challenging in some weird way. I am sure that my review will not always be negative. The day will come where I will give it a thumbs up. I'm even glad that I didn't bought it in the sale, but paid the full price.",1605263961,1618679184,True,0,1,0.714900672435760498,4,True,False,False

I think shapez.io is a great idea, and for the price, a great game too. It is very simple to understand and get into, and very easy to lose time with too. The only real problem I had was that after a while your map gets very cluttered with old production lines you made that get in the way. Yes you can delete them and make them better, but it always sucks a little to erase a bunch of progress. I wish that a game could be spread out over multiple maps perhaps, or have some sort of reason to reset everything.

Overall the game is just very tedious; you do the same thing over and over, with increasing complexity, but not much variety.

At its most basic, this game is about manipulating shapes and colours to deliver a requested combination of the two categories. While a few of the shapes are surprisingly tough to crack, solving the combination method isn't really the ultimate goal. 

What makes this game so engaging is that you can use a series of operations and circuit logic to make smarter, more efficient ""machines"" to produce the requested shapes. The real point is to create the fastest machines you can without wasting space or materials. You'll want to find ways to make your machines easy to re-use with the copy-paste tool, as well, as you'll be needing them multiple times. 

After unlocking Free Play at level 26, you will have all the tools you need to make a fully automated factory. But that's really just the beginning, as you build and improve upon your Make Anything Machine (MAM). Soon, the level requirements shift from demanding a certain number of a shape, to needing a shape delivered at a given minimum rate. Can you create a MAM that produces shapes quickly enough? That's the end goal of the game. Though I personally think you'll get more out of the solution if you work to make a MAM that is also easy to build and pleasing to look at.",1616750680,1616750680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The factory must grow
- Clever and efficient designing

shapez.io embodies ""The factory must grow"" which I'm sure will be good for most players. You will spend your time getting larger and larger. The gameplay loop is obvious and addictive.

shapez.io chooses to drop ""Clever and efficient designing"". It doesn't take very long before the ""best ways to do everything"" become apparent. There's no puzzle game aspect here. The map is infinite in size and the game is not punishing. There's exactly one way to do everything. The result is that my game will match up to your game nearly one-to-one, just change the locations of stuff. 

For the above reason, I wasn't very into shapez.io and didn't play for too long. Still, I feel like I got my money's worth and I think many will agree. For that reason I do recommend, but be aware of what type of experience you are looking for.

For extra praise:
- Man, the music is just banging. Music easily kept me playing and having a good time.
- This game is unnecessarily attractive. Makes the price tag feel low.
- The UI is minimalist, sleek, easy to use. shapez is ahead on how a factory builder should incorporate ease-of-use.
- Very late into the game, ""wires"" are unlocked. These are a bit more ""puzzle game"". Just introduced too late imo. 

For minor nit-picks:
- Copy-paste has become a standard of the genre and this game has it - unlocked after level 12, quite far into the game. Even worse, it costs resources to use in a game about everything being free. The inclusion feels confused. Copy-paste should be introduced very early and cost nothing to use. Knowing what to do, but having to painstakingly build the exact same thing more than once is just tedious.

After having played Factorio and Satisfactory thought the automation genre was at it's peak. shapez.io shows that it still has new ways to express itself in an entertaining way. As with all automation games, the game starts of simple but becomes increasingly more difficult as the game progresses. Have just scratched the surface. 

The game isn't penalizing you for placing buildings as these are free. The only thing the game is restricting is the number of inputs to the main Hub. To this hub you will bring all sorts of shapes that you will have to create through automation. Having your buildings go faster means bringing a specific shape to the main hub. Every shape is build of max 4 blocks with an additional 8 colors the shape can be in. This give a lot of different combinations that the game may ask for to be build. The next step is adding shapes on top of each other to create even more complex shapes. Not sure what is beyond that but am afraid to ask.

So basically, I got tricked there, since the sale is now cheaper, and that I was promised the lowest ever price. But to not be a raincloud, get this game.

In the game there are 4 basic shapes, and each shape can be chopped up in to 4 quadrants and recombined with other quadrants. You can stack shapes on shapes creating a stack of up to 4 shapes.

You can rotate the shapes.
The game slowly unlocks all this in a very logical way, asking you to send specific combinations to the central hub to unlock the next feature.
You move shapes around using conveyor belts.
After 26 different shapes have been provided, you have unlocked all the features and you get advanced tools to do sorting and even make a factory to auto build the shapes being requested. At which point you are optimising your factory to build it ever more efficient.

If you like building factories (i.e. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/]Factorio[/url]), you will probably like this game too. You can also [url=shapez.io]try[/url] it first.

[h1]Longer version:[/h1]
This game (as the name implies) is all about shapes. The shape is made up of four corners, every corner can be colored. You can even leave them out. You can also stack the different shapes together to create more complex looking shapes.

In the game the so called ""hub"" will ask you to create and deliver a certain amount shapes. After delivering them you will unlock new buildings, which introduce new mechanics and makes the progression faster. At the same time though, the shapes will get more complex (multiple colors, shapes, etc.). You will also unlock speed upgrades for the buildings in the game.

So if this speaks to you, you will (probably) enjoy it

My only issue with this game over other logistics games is the simple nature of making various simple shapes and patterns is slowly becoming repetative but I find it relaxing still.

The ""campaign"" or main progression is honestly probably 10-30 hours depending on how quick you are with it. After that its all creative based.

Like others have said, think a simple SIMPLE factorio concept but no power, no resources (to build with).

What's great about it is if you make a mistake it doesn't matter, just delete everything and start over. You don't control an avatar, you're just a god view camera that can go anywhere.

The actual building feels very fast and satisfying, you can play it for 15 minutes or several hours at a time.

I personally think the soundtrack is awesome, it makes you kinda groove and inspires you to ""get to work"". Great game paired with a cup of coffee.

Finally, for the price, even if you play it for 5 hours its completely worth it.

If you like factorio but find it overwhelming you'll love this game.

It's really the resource/belt/machine/ratio mechanics boiled down to the simplest possible form of geometric shapes. Think Factorio minus graphics and combat with colors and shapes in place of resources with unlimited resource nodes and no electricity.

In absence of story or overarching goal the challenge here is managing growing scale by continuous refactoring and standardizing existing hubs. The game does and excellent job by giving you smaller objectives (literally just shows you shapes you need to assemble) early on as it familiarizes you, in pace I find perfect, with progressively complex machines and additional, space-efficient, versions of existing ones.On top of this you have semi-optional goals granting you speed upgrades to entire ""classes"" of your machines, e.g. cutting/rotation/stacking, painting/mixing colors, belt speed, node extraction.

I can see how some people would be turned away by the simplistic visuals but to me this is part of the challenge. At a certain scale, when everything starts blurring together, you need to up your space-planning and standardization game, with blueprints unlocked to help you with that (copy/pasting costs some accumulated shapes!). In the late-game wires and simple, programmable logic kicks in to let you automate entire sections of your factory, down to automatically picking and producing the shapes you need.

Game is being actively expanded (wires being a late 2020 addition) and on top of it all game's source-code is mostly open-source which further ups the chance of future additions even if the original developer takes a back seat.

There is no dangers, no time limits or anything else of the ilk. 

Instead the game simply asks you to create simple objects of increasing complexity. Whether you want to go with minimum effort slow production, or try to create the most lean efficient machine ever is entirely up to you.

While there are the ""main"" objectives, keep in mind you will still need to make more of the previously created shapes and maybe some other similar shapes to improve the efficiency of already unlocked technologies.

In all, don't expect the game to blow your mind if you have played any other factory games. What it does is deliver a clean looking puzzle for you to just fiddle around with in your own pace. Just be aware that time might disappear quickly if you do.

If you like optimisation, production ratios and maximum throughput, this game is for you.

I tend to measure games on a hour per £ ratio. 1-1 is an acceptable ratio for me. This has a 6-1 ratio so far. Great value.

Pros - 
Fun and diverse soundtrack that didn't get old in the 30+ hours I played.
Sleek, clear and good looking visuals.
Engaging, complex gameplay that builds and iterates on itself.

Cons -
A couple of QOL things missing. Auto-tunnel would be great, for instance, as would the ability to build from the zoomed out overview.
Can get a bit jankey and framey towards the later game
The editing mode is a tiny bit too zoomed in for me, but that's likely a performance conceit.

Make some shapes. No rush yet? Just wait. Use your skills. You know you're better than this. You know how to make GOOD machines. There... that's better. Hmm... running slow... must make more...
Oh... that piece would have come in handy. Oh well, I'll just make my new machines using that. If only I could make PARALLEL machines...

...but you don't have that copy-paste item yet. Patience. It's what got you this far into your career. THERE. Oh what sweet dopamine that is! Now you have currency to spend on expanding your beautifully crafted parallel machines. Now you feel it. If only just one more level. Oh... GODDAMMITT!!

Know what?  If this is what I have to work with... these are the tools I can expect later on... I'm going to throw everything away and start from scratch because I.am.SO.much.better.than.this.

Then you start over.
Then your machines are beautiful and parallel.
Then the rush comes in.
Then the sweet dopamine and serotonin get you high.
Then the responsibilities in the real world can wait... because you keep playing... because it's sooooo gooooood...

Then you begin to shiver from the serotonin syndrome.
Then you question if you should keep going.
Then you realize your daily responsibilities are being neglected.
Then you see that at some stage it's the 'end'... you will get to ""Freeplay""... the ""End"" of the game.
Then you will quit... you promise yourself.

Then you get to ""FreePlay""
Then the floodgates open.

What you once thought would be the stage that lets you quit this drug and go back to the real world... will, instead, get you bit by the Everything Machine.
Just build it.
You know you want to.
Tweak it when it fails a level here or there. Build a gated storage tank to pump shapes into the hub at a faster rate. Build an automated timer to do the work for you. Build a way to adjust the timer automatically. Enhance. Repeat.

Your job, s.o., chores, pets... kids...

-Music is surprisingly wholesome.

-Controls are very intuitive, although do take a look at the settings and change a few things like enabling Multiplace and Theme to Dark. (both should have been enabled by default IMO)

-I love when games don't have a ""difficulty"" setting but you can still put the effort you want, casual or hardcore. You can have a small factory and leave it to collect resources and don't bother with optimazation or actually take the time to make it massive, in order to complete the objective faster.

Imagine Factorio without having to worry about threats or having to manually build items before you can automate them and then build with those items. In this game you just build. This is an ultimate sandbox title where only your imagination and designs are the limit here! 

The game is simple. You mine for shapes which you can cut up and re-arrange into a different shape along with different colours. Colours are also something that you can mine but with colours you can also combine them to make new colours to use.

This game presents you with constraints such as needing to scale up production of making these different shapes so you can make them fast enough to achieve your production goal. Of course you could just leave the game running all day but it's encouraged that you do it quicker as the amount of shapes you need to produce increases which means you're going to be forced to have to scale up eventually. Some shapes also require you to make a certain amount each second.

However, this game makes it insanely easy to scale up. You can copy, paste, cut and then rotate a pattern that was derived from what you've made before. There's no cost other than time.

The graphics in this game are also rather simple but they are simple in such a way that is pleasing to the eye. 

I am satisfied with this game. However, if you're a hard core Factorio player then you may find this game to be overly simplistic but in my opinion I think this game is a wonderful introduction for a beginner to learn how to scale and produce things for a simulation title.

I would highly recommend giving this game a go! It's very cheap and has a lot of replay value.",1609740367,1609740367,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is like factorio stripped down to its bare bones, there are no resources, it's all infinite, no enemies, no terrains, and the graphics are quite minimum. Your objective is to construct shapes out of other shapes and colours. This may be one of the simplest games I've ever played and yet I still found it endearing. Making shapes out of other shapes was interesting to figure out and the milestones were always satisfying. Paired with a nice soundtrack this games is quite fun.
But it isn't perfect, once i got up to tier 17 the game got too laggy for the game to run smoothly and building became almost painful. Looking for certain shapes was tedious and annoying. After a while building became the same and was quite monotonous.
For a game that is in early access i'll let a lot of these slide but the developers need to optimize the game for a playable experience and different buildings and/or something that breaks up the same copy paste construction line should be implemented and some way to make the area interesting would also be nice.

My recommendation to anyone who gets frustrated early, is to build it spaced out, so you get a feel of the belts and such, then figure out how to remake it to save the most space. There are no baddies to shoot, the resources seem to be infinite, and the music is chill. The only enemy in this game is your own impatience.

If you liked Factorio but hated the critters-research-gathering, this is the game for you. It is a simple relaxing factory builder but you do not have to worry about materials or enemies. You can build however you like and demolish and rebuild without have to worry about anything. The beginning of the game is pretty simple, is that you need to deliver simple shapes to you HUB. As the game goes on you add colors to your shapes, then start mixing different colors and shapes together.
I have attached some gameplay above to show you the first few minutes of the game, so you know what your getting into.

Pros
Simple game, easy to learn, and super relaxing
It’s a great game for when you don’t have a lot of time or something you can drop and pick back up quickly
Can’t beat the price

Cons
It hurts my soul when I build a beautiful part of my Factory then have to get rid of it because I no longer need that shape/color.

Initially, I love it.  I enjoy the concept, and the leveling is fun and somewhat intuitive (for the most part...we'll get back to that).  Taking just 4 shapes and cutting them into quadrants, coloring, cutting and combining them into the required shapes is actually fun.  So is developing your own little 'factories' for each operation you can eventually copy and paste around the board...then upgrade, and move on.

But there is a bad.  And it's hard to describe without actually playing the game.  Eventually, there seems to be a large dependence on a piece type that's not actually supported by the games own systems.  You need to combine 'shrunken' pieces to make the shapes.  But the game doesn't actually support shrunken pieces.  Every other type of combination can be made separately and combined later, even 4 separate quadrant pieces.  But not shrunken ones.  They force you to create these frankensteiniean, ugly pieces and go through some odd cut and combine process to keep the game from restoring it back to the correct size.

This is exasperated by the level that is supposed to teach you this technique.  The instructional bit says to seperate the pieces out, and recombine them...but you can't.  It's own instructions can't show how to make it work.

Now this wouldn't be a problem to me, but the later levels DEPEND on this.  A LOT.  I got to a level that required a shrunken piece inside another shrunken piece in only one quadrant and I said that's it.  It simply isn't worth the pain to try and not undo the work you've done trying to make these pieces because you can't figure out how to rotate it just the right way.

So while I want to recommend the game, I can't for it being too annoying in the later levels for me to want to continue playing.  Make it so I can shrink a bit and cut it apart WITHOUT it undoing itself, like you would actually think would happen, and I may actually come back to make endless factories of increasing sizes just to fiddle with the game.  But as long as it depends on that mechanic itself doesn't support, I can't recommend this game.",1607666411,1607666411,False,27,2,0.648289024829864502,2,True,False,False

Ever play Factorio?  Here’s a minimalist version of the game, also there’s no enemies. Just crazy amounts of tracks, machines and shapes. 

Gameplay - 10

The game starts off simple enough, you have to deliver a shape to the main HUB.  Okay simple enough.  Once you reach the required amount you unlock something else.  Now you need to provide a different shape.  Okay still not too hard, each shape builds upon the other ones, unlocking new machines to use in crafting/constructing newer shapes.  Then they add in colors, then mixing colors, then stacking then  then then.

How is such a simple game so good?  I started it up and then 5 hours later was trying to determine the best way to rearrange my various ‘factories’ to make them more efficient and productive.  At one point I had to have a certain shape with colors produced and making 8 of them per second. Simple enough.  Just have to tweak this, and this and build a new production line.  Well now that line isn’t producing enough, let's go back and replace some of it and now we’re up to 2 per second.  Hmm.  That’s not right. 

Seriously how is this game so good? The premise is pretty simple but they way they introduce each thing and build upon your previous knowledge is done very well. Each new machine/improvement adds more and more to the game.  I haven’t even finished everything and my ‘factories’ are ridiculously complex. Yet it’s all one simple thing piled upon another and another. 

Story -  N/A

No story, no bad guys, just infinite building. 

Graphics - 10

Simple, elegant and perfect. 

Controls -10(mouse/keyboard)

Point and click.  Then use the keyboard commands as you get more and more involved and don’t have time to click way over there. Again, super simple yet so powerful. 

Repeatability - ??

This is tricky.  In games like this you’re constantly changing things over and over, or thinking of new ways to make your production better/faster.  Or you just unlocked a new piece of equipment or an updated version of something you already have.  Now you have to redo several pieces of your ‘factory’ to make them run smoother.  

So yeah there’s a ton of repeatability.  I even started over 2 times and now have 3 factories at various stages.   Each one is built differently as you can see my thinking and trying to make things easier for later. 


Music - 10

Background noise. Serene and soothing as you rack your brain trying to build this section perfectly. 

Multiplayer - N/A

There’s not any and that’s a good thing, don’t want some moron messing up my exquisitely crafted factory. 

Initial Thoughts:

Only 5 bucks huh?  Well I’ll give it a shot. 

Hmm. so just move squares over, that seems simple enough. Oh now I unlocked a new machine.  So wait I can.


6 hours later. 

Me muttering to myself about how the damn shapes don’t make any sense and how I need to color the bottom left color white, while the top left corner needs to be magenta and then both pressed onto a solid cyan square, then move that onto a blue star shaped.  Which then needs to be delivered to my Hub at 4 per second. 



Soma Says: 

If you’re a fan of automation then this is a must play.  I don’t often do videos, but I got into a streaming mindset and started my 3rd factory.  Here’s a video of the first 2 hours of playing the 3rd factory.  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/811974618  

I’d like to say I’m a master of the game but I’m not, however it’s still fun to watch, you can see the progression and all that. Try not to be too critical of how I did things, I'm still learning.

Now, this is definitely a puzzle game in the vein of games like Factorio where you have to create long complicated conveyor belts to connect various shapes and colors together to create outputs of ever-increasing form.  Unlike other games in this genre, including the previous game made by Tobspr, this is just what it is.  There's no monsters, aliens or zombies at night: you just have to build ever-more-complicated shapes to unlock various upgrades and to win the various levels.  It's very relaxing in a zen sort of way as there's no way to fail: at worst you build a slightly wrong shape and can adjust the various cutting and rotating widgets as necessary. 

Note: I advise looking around the map when you first start.  I spent about a half hour trying to cut squares into diamonds before realizing that those come from a separate quarry and weren't some trick of turning squares 45 degrees.  (There are quarries of circles, squares, and other shapes plus red, yellow and blue colors that need to be mixed to make the rest.) 

Also, the tools are great!  Use them and experiment with them.  They are all useful and necessary especially the one that merges and splits lanes, as there is only one end point, The Hub, and while it has about 16 ports you can connect to, you will have dozens if not hundreds of starting points.   I also enjoyed figuring out how to make green and cyan.  I assume I can also make purple, but I haven't experimented with the paint widget enough.  

I'm only up to level 10 and really loving it so far!

It looks and sounds so simple, but the longer you play, the more you realize that the game can get very complex and very challenging quite fast. But the thing is that it doesn't get too complicated, because the tips and help you get along the way make sure that you have the time to work with and understand all the new mechanics and intricacies that the game slowly pushes your way.

And it's strangely relaxing. It doesn't push you towards an endgoal and at times I just look at the wonderful 'machine' I've built and enjoy how efficiently it's doing its job. To see you start with simple shapes, then cut them up, turn them, glue them back, add colors, layer them on top of each other to create all-new shapes that you didn't even realize you could make is just so rewarding.

As you ""advance"" by fulfilling certain objectives (building X number of shapes) you unlock more complicated machines, even more upgrades... as your ""manufacturing"" spreads across the land... 

The game starts simple: connect a certain ""shape"" production zone to the ""hub"". Then you steadily step up in complexity as you need to cut the shapes apart (up to 4 times!), rotate them, color them (and combine colors), and recombine different shapes. You also need to combine multiple ""completed"" shapes together, each a different color. 

While you have ""level"" objectives, there are also ""upgrade"" objectives where building a certain number of shapes (and combinations thereof, like 3000 of shape X, and 5000 of shape Y...) would enable speed upgrades. 

You can simply have patience if you don't want to optimize the production, but the fun is attempting to squeeze in some production optimization with some fancy layout. It's easy to put in ONE paint node, but how would you layout FOUR paint nodes, which requires TWO inputs AND one output each? Can you double that too? 

You get stats for how fast is your production for each shape variation, like you are making shape Z at 2.4 per second. As some of those objectives later requires like 8000 units or even more, it can be a LONG wait if you don't optimize. But it can be done. 

And you slowly gain more and more capabilities as you can go ""refit"" your old area with the new tools you got... and go further and further from the hub (and add ""markers"" so you can jump around) as you discover more shapes and so on. 

It's endless, and hard to stop playing. If you like the genre, buy it. It compares to games that costs many times more.",1606491287,1606491287,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

there is still some stuff on my to-do list. Like building a machine that analyzes and replicates the required shapes in their color. I think the term here MAM.

The game has a decent pace. You can totally relax while building or speeding things up considerably by constructing more units.

Take the building elements from these and subtract the action segments, and you get a game that is purely logistic based- hours of fun. 

The game is simple and relaxing, yet makes you think about complex approach to logistic problems. Before you know it, you get acquainted with methods such as concurrent and parallel processing; things that would otherwise sound boring and tiresome. 

Shapez holds your hand gently, teaching you along the way how the core mechanics work, but also lets you think for yourself without breaking a sweat. Of course the aforementioned games also have similar concepts but instead of focusing on either the waves of enemies, or the timer, or the grinding, here you are left with thinking about only efficiency. It is this goal that drives your design, and can turn your entire system into a complex piece of art (just look at the sceenshots! some look like PCB components for microprocessors) or a distorted, mumbled, scattered work of art. Either would do! But you would feel the inclination to go back and constantly fix the previous mistakes in your design. 

In a sense this game is a disguised educational app: a perfect logistics simulator without the fancy gfx or high system requirements. . Not to mention the price is darn cheap too.
So what are you waiting for, if you are into the genre, get it. Support the devs while having a blast with it. 

New wire update makes the game million times better thanks to logic system being implemented. If you are one of those who love make logic-based system in a game or software, you know what you are up for!",1593126896,1606370585,True,22,0,0.732522726058959961,0,True,False,False

Build big, build small, build duplicates, build simple, build complicated. The game is criminally cheap. The developer is, as of writing, knocking out updates regularly. You can devote as much or as little attention to the game and still get a lot of enjoyment. One of the best valued buys for me this year.


A casual, stress free automation/factory builder. Sure, it's no Factorio but that is its strength. There is no resource restrictions on factory components, if you want a 100 mile long conveyor you go for it. Likewise you're not limited on space which often, in my experience, can prove frustrating when playing games like Factorio.

The challenge, build different shapes and colour combinations from resources dotted around the map and deliver a specified amount to your hub. There is no end state, you can walk away and leave your machines to it. You can make your production lines as efficient, expansive or compact as you like. This allows you to play the game to your preference rather than through arbitrary limitations of the game design.

As you progress through level objectives and targets (reach a certain number of a specific shape and colour combo) you can upgrade equipment and unlock new factory components. These range from faster operational effectiveness of your components to new components that provide extra functionality. The choice is then yours as to whether you want to use these to improve your solutions.",1593166031,1606338413,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Shapez.io is best explained as Factorio without resource management (atleast, not in the sense of resources that can be depleted), its a game about building a factory that uses recurring shapes to make more intricate shapes that you use for upgrades, and these upgrades then in turn give you access to more elaborate things as well as increase the speed of your machines to make things more intricate in efficient.

In a way, Shapes.io is the embodiment of efficiency and speed, and that's the whole point of the game. Other than ""currency tokens"" that you start making early on, there are no concrete resources in the game that you need to micromanage. You can build as complex of a system as you want since there's no material requirements for the construction of items, which adds an air to creativity because you feel you aren't constrained to not go ""all out."" The sole goal is to keep expanding, upgrading, and leveling up. Its an endless gameplay loop, that although might sound boring, never really did for me. Its a very calm and relaxing game to play, and if you're a fan of games like Factorio I highly recommend you try this game.

I purchased the game on sale on a whim thinking it would be a good way to find out if I would enjoy the factory\automation genre.  Instead I found a gem of a game that stands on its own. 

  Shapez.io is very much a problem solving game about solving the flow of production and doing the right action at the right time and optimizing as needed .  It is quite fun creating designs then trying to redo them but more efficiently.
 
 I find Shapez.io relaxing to play, a kind of palate cleanser. I play a lot of games to de-stress and have fun, but even games I really enjoy can sometimes add stress. But shapez.io does not. It is simple and yet still challenges the mind. 

  If you are at all interested in trying out the factory\automation genre I recommend giving shapez.io a try.

As others have said, this game is similar to Factorio, but without the survival aspect. I did not like the survival part of that game. Other games that this is similar to are SpaceChem and Blueprint Tycoon. However, instead of having an overworld map and a building inside map like those games, everything is on the overworld in this game. So, you can see your inputs and outputs next to each other if you want. If you enjoyed those games, then you will likely enjoy this game.

If you have never played those games, and the video/images of this game on the store page look confusing, this may help. The game starts off simple. You start off by placing parts (extractors) on specific shapes on the map. Then, you add a conveyor belt to move the items that those extractors pull off the ground from the extractor to a central hub. As you add more of the requested shapes, you are rewarded with tools and tool upgrades that allow you to get more items at once, and move them faster. Eventually, you will be tasked with taking shapes apart and recombining them into new shapes. Finally, you will add various paint colors to the parts.

There is no story. There is just extracting, changing, and depositing. As you do more, you increase the speed of your system, and extract more, change faster, and deposit more. You can make things as efficient or not efficient as you want. I think this game is more enjoyable if you enjoy flows and processes with inputs and outputs (be it games, work, or whatever).

Shapez.io has no set time to complete your current shape. So, you can focus on the level up shapes while trickling in the current level's shape, or build your own shapes. You can have a single processor for a shape, or you can build multiple processors to create multiples of the same shape.

Once you hit level 20, some of the shapes get complicated. I had to look up the Level 20 ""Logo"" shape to figure out the small square in the bottom left. Once I learned how to do that, some of the later ones were easier, because I was able to use a similar process.

The music is chillin, the gameplay is making fun and feels motivating.
There is no timelimit, the map is hugh, not sure if even endless.
Mechanics are simple,intuitive and work fine.
5€ and already totally worth it!

Factorio is still better.

+No walking, traversal in general has been tremendously reduced, especially since you can setup fast travel points just by right clicking on the map
+Unlimited resources and buildings allow the game to have a tighter focus on logistics
+belt planner allows you to build straight belt lines without needing a steady hand
+Unlocking new buildings and features requires more complex and different shapes, including levels that require a minimal manufacturing speed instead of large quantities

+/-Weird logistic numbers force you to think differently about your setups, but also makes your setups liable to inefficiency when you get upgrades, making reconstruction a common task in the game
+/-Linear tech tree enforces various aspects of the game's challenge, but unmotivates you to beat the next level if it's for an upgrade you don't really care about (like the throughput reader)

-various simple features (like blueprinting, throughput reading, etc.) are locked behind the tech tree when they should've been unlocked from the start
-painting is incredibly lopsided and slow, asking you to make weird setups that take long enough to figure out that you'll usually beat the current level with a slow and basic setup while making an upgrade tree setup
-blueprinting (copying setups and placing them down) requires you to craft and send in cash just to do so. More annoying is that you can't simply move setups by 1 tile and have to pay for cut pasting as well at the same price as copying too. The fact that it's relatively cheap to do so makes the requirement completely pointless.
-unlocking tech makes you wait 5 seconds before you can continue playing",1605550660,1605550660,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not perfect--it feels almost too simple (at least in the early stages), the copy&paste requiring shapes is aggravating (also, is it actually possible to save blueprints, or can I only use whatever I copy?), and there are a few idiosyncracies I've found when attempting to curve a belt near an unused splitter/merger output (the belt cannot be curved; it *always* takes items out of the splitter), but it's very addicting to play. I keep coming back to this game to improve throughput and change entire sections of my factory to create new shapes more efficiently.

One complaint I really have, though, is that I can't actually use copy&paste very effectively. Aside from requiring a *lot* of difficult-to-produce shapes, I can't seem to figure out how to build anything from a template, instead having to one-at-a-time adapt items I have nearby (this makes systems of sequential operations tedious to construct). Items like painters or stackers are very particular about what inputs you use, and I have to interleave my belts. This is a lot of fiddly work that I had to do many times in the early game, and they're slow, so I can't just use one or even five. Even with copy and paste, I have to wait a while for my stash of Copy Shapes to build back up, *find somewhere in my factory* that I have an existing not-too-horrible design, copy it, paste it, fix all the bugs that the new layout caused (I'd love a feature that deletes shapes off of a belt by clicking it, somewhat like Factorio's F button except without picking up the items), and then have to live with crappy throughput until I can paste it a few more times.",1604866246,1604866246,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay loop is awesome. The game constantly ups the complexity of shapes, requiring even more monstrous factories. There's even resource goals, aside from the main goals, which let you upgrade your belts and buildings by making other shapes.

shapez.io is a minimalist take on Factorio, where you aren't restricted by resources, but rather only by your imagination. There's a certain zen to its simplicity. You build factories that chop up, paint, stack, and piece together various shapes. You start with only a few options for building, but quickly unlock more as your deliver the required materials. Many are direct upgrades, allowing you to retrofit or rebuild old factories with new technologies. Eventually you unlock circuits that allow you to automate things further, creating completely independent factories.

At a certain point, Shapez's simple premise takes a turn for the worse, adding in unintuitive puzzle-like mechanics to the previously simple shapebuilding. Floating parts, empty layers, and a weird set of logic behind it all makes it more frustrating than rewarding. It doesn't help that the system for stacking shapes is bug-ridden, sometimes locking you out of progressing if you happen to have made a mistake in a stacking formula. This system is purposefully obtuse, with prominent community members claiming these puzzle-like aspects ""make the game worth playing."" To me, they keep it from being something I want to continue playing.

But after only about six to ten hours, you finish everything, and you really don't have any new or exciting problems to solve.  This game is really great until you reach the end.  You can keep playing and improving things, but it starts to feel repetitive and bland like a cookie clicker game.  So it's not quite as great as Factorio, but it is still very fun to play the first four or five hours of a playthrough.

This game is also a little bad on memory management.  While you can build numerous, large factories, you still have to be mindful of the tick time.  If you get too creative, you might slow down your game!  One time, I had an average tick speed of about 1.5 ms per tick (pretty fast), and then I needed to extract a shape that was quite far from the center of the map (around a thousand units along both axes).  After routing those shapes back to the center, my tick speed would still average out to around 1.5 ms per tick, but it would spike to 4 - 6 ms per tick, forcing me to lower the tick rate from 240 Hz to 120 Hz.  That was caused by only one extraction site far from the center, so that's kind of disappointing.  You still have plenty of space to build around the center, though, and in the early parts of a playthrough, everything is perfect and works just fine.  Performance is much less of a concern in Factorio than it is in this game.

Probably arising from the suboptimal memory management, this game has trouble maintaining accurate throughputs in large processing lines (having many steps in ""crafting"").  The numbers say that something will work at certain speeds, but if your factories are large at all, there will be enough of a performance drop that the ratios don't work out the way they should.  (Of course, I rarely see Factorio have that kind of problem.)  I shouldn't compare this game to Factorio too much because it's cheaper, and there's simply less (not a bad thing).  It's like comparing a squirt gun to a kinetic energy penetrator.

I find that this game is worth the money.  For five bucks, it provides many hours of fun, depending on how fast you intend to reach the main goal.",1604114955,1604114955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game still has annoyances that make me reluctant to recommend it, but it is fun.

The belt placement continues to be an annoyance. In later stages, scaling up can be problematic. You do eventually unlock the ability to copy/paste designs which help, but copy/pasting isn't 'free', it costs a number of a specific shapes. Certain UI features aren't intuitive.

The biggest issues for me are:

* Belt rotation is not honored. If a belt is rotated to face right and you drag from right to left, it faces left.
* There is a rotate button, but no keybind to rotate in the opposite direction. The issue is the same for selecting variants of a building/factory/whatever. You can move forward through the list, but not backwards.
* Late game requires you to scale to obscenely high levels unless you don't mind idling. This normally wouldn't be an issue, but the controls feel cumbersome for this.
* Late game has timing bugs and performance issues.

The core gameplay is fun. I will keep playing, but the issues above still stand.

Took me roughly 20 hours on the first play through to finish level 18 and unlock Free Play Mode. The biggest challenge is coming up with new and creative ways to organize the various processes, otherwise you end up cut/paste a cutting/painting/etc module that works and using just that all over your map which takes some interest out of the game.

Wiring Update:
I've put another 30+ hours into the game since the update (and started a new factory). The tutorials for when you finally get the unlocking any of the wiring components in the late 20s are pretty bad. There is no reason to integrate the first few components you get as you don't unlock the logic elements until last before freeplay. Unless you have a background and experience in designing circuitry/programming, the tutorials will do absolutely nothing for helping you fully integrate these new components into a working factory, let alone work towards making a ""Make Anything Machine"". Very frustrating as I love this game but just don't even know where to start with utilizing these new components. There are also some throughput related bugs that now courtesy of the belt readers, even perfectly mathed out factories do not reliably produce a full belt's worth of shapes.

Shapez.io will do. It's only a few bucks, and if even that's too much, a good portion of the game can be played completely free on their website.

Shapez has problems. There are balance issues that become apparent in the later stages. [strike]There's a game-ending bug that makes the final level broken.[/strike] The soundtrack, while catchy at first, is better turned off before its looping eats your brain. Shapez appears to be Javascript running in a self-contained browser, and that may uncover performance problems.  Scrolling across the vast map is painfully slow.

That said, the fix to some of these problems -- including the game-ending stacker bug -- is alleged to be arriving in about a week.  Unfortunately, it is coming with a whole new *layer* of functionality (wires) that should cause all new problems! The game is under active development by a single developer, so this review will be out of date within weeks.  But I think there's a warning to be made:

It feels like they have fallen into the trap that is eating Minecraft -- they are providing the bare atoms for building a world, allowing the clever-but-insane types to create **ANYTHING**.  They're bringing redstone to their world. While it is academically interesting to see what people can build, the *game* starts to suffer, I feel.

As it sits today, though, [strike]modulo the game-breaking bugs,[/strike] the game is catchy and fun and has destroyed days of my time. It is a great deal, and I recommend it, but I think you should prepare yourself to walk away when it gets insane.  

I should take that advice, too.

Edit: As promised, the 'Wires' update has made some changes to the balance, the broken stacker/cutter has been fixed, and the soundtrack extended, along with some performance fixes that I can't say I really noticed.  I haven't yet gotten to play with the new Wires system, but so far I'm pretty happy with the update.",1601325702,1603079551,True,2,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

But lets dig in a bit.

Shapez.io has a interesting minimalist take on the traditional factory builder style game. You get a (I assume randomly) generated field of shapes and colors, and are given a variety of increasingly complex shapes to create from the shapes/colors around you with the machines you have.

As you progress you increase the speed of your machines, unlock new types of machines, and unlock more complex or niche varieties of machines you already have. This works to have an almost integrated tutorial system, where each level gives you a new tool, and then helps ease you into the use of that tool.

However, it never really gets old. The shapes begin getting complex in ways that require new approach's to your manufacturing systems, and once you hit freeplay the goals shift from being a certain number of shapes, to a certain rate of production/delivery of the shapes, this forces players to adapt and try to either create more efficient designs, or consume large chunks of their world with expansive machines to pump out more of the shapes.

Now there are some downsides, for one, one of the major shapes in the games progression relies on a really odd and counter-intuitive mechanic to make, although once you get it figured out it is relatively simple to produce, it can make trying to naturally discover how to make that shape somewhat challenging (beyond a traditional trial/error system, due to the mechanic almost being bug-like in nature). HOWEVER, thats the only shape I've found that has an issue like that, and from browsing the discord/reddit it seems it really is only that one shape that has that issues.

Additionally, there are some optimization issues with the end-game. Until you have 12/16 of the hubs inputs filled with maxed out conveyor production of 3 or 4 layer shapes, you likely wont notice it, but once you get to making ""everything machines"" or ramping production of the Tier VIII+ upgrade materials, you will feel it. However, the dev has made a few optimization updates, and from what I've read the game will likely continue to get optimization updates, especially as it just received the wires update, which dropped the whole new wires/logic system mechanic.

Speaking on that. Honestly, not much to say regarding the wires mechanic, it functions like basically every other boolean based logic system in games, if you've done redstone computers in minecraft, or any wiring in terraria, it'll be a very familiar system, and offers some very interesting ideas for late game machines and automation.

All in all, if I'd paid $20 for this game I still would feel like I got a fair amount for my money. Its a solid game, easily a 8/10 or 9/10 for its genre and what its trying to be (minimalist factory builder), but given that it also is only $5, its an easy sell for me.

Mom: We have Factorio at home.
Factorio at home:

Seriously, though, this game is fantastic. Shapez.io innovates on the concept that Factorio is, a 2D factory builder, by making it essentially bare-bones. It does not involve combat, depleting resource nodes, or even power (not for now, an update is coming soon), which are some of the more challenging aspects of a game like Factorio. This minimalistic approach to such a genre makes the game quite enjoyable, but not necessarily easy or simple. The challenge and thrill of designing efficient layouts of machines and belts is still very much there. And, as you progress through the linear milestones, unlocking new ""buildings"" or machines to work with, the game's complexity increases along with it. You're still getting all the action of a factory builder in this seemingly dumbed down game, and this is certainly a good thing. To top it all off, a $4 price tag for a game like this made by a single person is essentially a steal. I will go so far to say that this game is severely underpriced for the amount of quality work that has gone into this game. So, do yourself a favor and pick this game up now (the price will increase to $6 after the power update) and enjoy Shapez.io, a simple but amazingly well crafted factory game.

Update 10/9/20:
The wires update has finally been released (10/8 it was released I believe). This update appears to add a whole new level of complexity to the game, a second layer that contains wires that are used to control factory machines. This update also brought along several other changes, mainly to the user interface. The settings menu looks complete and clean, an animated factory background for the title screen was implemented, splash text was put on the title, and much more. These little changes make the game that much better. i have to seriously give props to the guy that is making this game, he has been hard at work for months developing this and it is absolutely fantastic. The price increased just a buck to $4.99, but it is still worth every bit of that. I wouldn't be disappointed to buy it at that price at all. This update has brought many good things, so consider picking this game up to enjoy a well made game.",1595795139,1602289683,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False
