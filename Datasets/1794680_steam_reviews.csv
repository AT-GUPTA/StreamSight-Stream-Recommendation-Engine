Imagine this: You're a lone survivor armed with a measly whip, surrounded by an endless horde of bloodsuckers with questionable hygiene. This, my friends, is Vampire Survivor, where death is your BFF and garlic is your holy grail.


➡ The Good:

• Simple but Addictive: It's easy to learn, hard to master, and impossible to put down. Think ""bullet hell"" meets ""endless runner"" with a dash of ""why am I laughing while dying?""
• Power Up Frenzy: Garlic, crosses, spinach, axes...the list goes on! Each upgrade is hilarious and hilariously overpowered. Who knew a clock could be so deadly?
• Death is Just a Suggestion: You'll die. A lot. But each run is different, and the sense of progression is incredibly satisfying. Plus, watching your character explode in a shower of garlic and spinach is oddly therapeutic.
• Price is Right: This game costs less than a pizza and delivers more entertainment than a whole haunted house. Seriously, what are you waiting for?


➡ The Bad (But Not Really Bad):

• Repetitive After a While: The core gameplay loop doesn't change much, but the sheer number of unlockables and challenges keeps things fresh.
• Can Get Grindy: Reaching max level takes some dedication (or a lot of garlic bread). But hey, that's part of the fun, right?
• Story? What Story?: There's no grand narrative, just pure, unadulterated survival against the undead masses. But honestly, who needs a story when you have garlic?
• Cross-Platform Blues: I played this on my phone first, then my PC. Sadly, no cross-platform sign-in, meaning my garlic-fueled progress vanished!


➡ Overall:

Vampire Survivor is a hilarious, addictive, and surprisingly deep experience for the price of a latte. Just be prepared to die a lot, question your sanity, and become strangely obsessed with garlic.


⦿ Would recommend to: Anyone who enjoys fast-paced action, doesn't mind a little (or a lot) of death, and has a healthy appreciation for garlic-fueled mayhem.

⦿ Would NOT recommend to: People with anger management issues, those who prefer their games with a side of sunshine and rainbows, and anyone who is allergic to garlic (or vampires).

‣ P.S. Don't underestimate the power of the clock. It's a game-changer. And seriously, watch out for the Reaper. He's not here to party.

‣ P.P.S. Devs, please hear our pleas! Add cross-platform sign-in, and we'll be eternally grateful (and garlic-powered)!",1708871493,1708871493,True,1,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

10/10: A really satisfying arcade-style game. Great game to play while listening to podcasts or music. 

[h2] Gameplay [/h2] 
Arcade-style gameplay: replay levels to try to do better and better. You earn gold to spend on permanent power ups to help you survive longer in the next stage. Your character auto-attacks, so you really only need directional movement and then confirming choices of power-ups when you level up. 

I could see folks getting bored with this gameplay, but I think this game is really useful if you want to listen to audiobooks or podcasts while playing a game.

[h2] Story [/h2]
There's no real story. You just try to survive each level as long as you can.

[h2] Graphics [/h2]
Pixel graphics but with great effects

[h2] Music [/h2]

There are some cool sprites and interesting ideas, but the excessive animations and especially the obnoxious chest cutscenes make this game painful to look at most of the time. And the maps are generally bland and overly repetitive such that it's tedious to walk from one end to the other past endless copies of the same few tiles for the one thing that is found at the far corner of the map. They keep adding content but it doesn't fix any of the core issues with the game.

The music is [i]amazing[/i], the weapon combos are overpowered as hell, the characters are cool with no dialogue and little-to-no story (especially the ones from Legacy of the Moonspell), and the effects some of the attacks make are insane. The lore was a bit hard to grasp for me, but it's a minor part of the game and isn't really the main selling point. There's much more offered here than just a mindless point-and-shoot game to kill time with. If you think you'll enjoy it from the trailers and have a lot of time to waste, try it out.

So fuckin addictive, simple idea that makes u wanna play whole day. Many stages and characters to choose from which means u can play for many hours.

Achievements are easy to obtain, u just need to play and unlock every item and character. Instructions about achievements  are avaiable in game so u don't even have to use guides.

I didn't know about this game at first. I didn't know when it was released on year 2022 after it got developed in 2021 -which the demo available on itch.io. After got married and got children, I became mobile phone gamer: someone who just actively searching game that can be played quickly in my small spare time, and yet really enjoyable to be considered as ""fun"" entertainment for me.

At some point in early 2023 I stumbled upon certain genre of game in mobile phone game market: top down shooter with rogue lite elements. I played few games that I considered ""Okay"", but got annoyed with -of course- mobile phone game model with ads, energy system, and with a lot of games have exact copy of asset and weapons that can be used. It moved me to search similar game with unique asset and not a copy of others.

I found few, and installed a game that I actually enjoyed. It was difficult, but felt different. I went to give rating for the game, but surprised with the bad reviews. Many of them said it is a clone of ""vampire survivors"". That is the first time I knew about this game. I immediately search about it and found it is available here on Steam. I didn't purchase it that time - because it was around the time vampire survivors got released on mobile.

So, I played it in my phone and it is light enough for my kind-of-old phone. It was a blast. I got a game that easily started, played, and enjoyed in my spare time. I went through all original unlocks and secrets after struggling at first. I am sure time spend playing it in my phone reach hundred hours. After enjoying it in mobile, I decided to buy this game, and later the DLCs. Because I have experience before, it didn't took long to get 100% achievement.

I simply recommend this game for someone who search for a game that could be played in short-time frame, and yet still really enjoyable in the long run.",1708502963,1708502963,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

I got this game after watching two of my favourite YT gaming channel videos, but I got very disappointed of what this game actually is. It is in fact a casual game, as casual as Pac-Man and for me that's a bygone era. I'd give the game a like if it'd require more input from the player; there are some maps where you have to walk down the path to grab an item to unlock it, but that's all about. You've got a bunch of characters to choose from, but it doesn't matter which character will you pick, the gameplay is always the same. Basically you've got to get the most OP weapons and then just stay in place and wait for the run to end. I understand it's a causal game, but nobody mentioned it's a part-idler! For 15 minutes let's say you've got to gather gems to get your gear, but once you have it you just wait until you get your goal. Sometimes another 15 minutes, sometimes 45, so go ahead and make yourself scrambled egg and wash the dishes while your game is playing. I don't mind idle games, but this one requires you to check on within the run.

Another thing are DLC's, where each one costs about the same as the base game (£1) and adds only one map and a few characters. Nice trick to milk the money from completionists.",1708288098,1708288098,False,0,1,0.427288174629211426,1,True,False,False

I think it's worth a try (especially since it's a relatively cheap game) to see if you enjoy the game style then check out similar games if you do.

No element of the game, in any given run, is unique enough from the others of its kind to provide any functional difference in gameplay from run to run in virtually any circumstance. With a handful of exceptions, every map, playable character, enemy, and even item or statistic is functionally comparable to one another to such an extreme that they may as well be identical. The content in this game does not quite feel cloned, but it does lack any semblance of individuality, meaning that two runs played on separate stages with separate characters and completely separate builds will both come across and functionally operate as completely the same. There is no creative decision-making or problem-solving to be done.

To me and to many others aware of these shortcomings, this is still a very fun video game. There is something inherently satisfying about watching waves upon waves of enemies get obliterated without lifting a finger, and reaching the threshold in any given run where you become unstoppable. If this simple enjoyment is enough for you to disregard the repetitive tedium of the gameplay loop, or if you have no priority on unlocks in general, then you will probably like Vampire Survivors. It is easy to learn and requires little attention. This praise comes hand-in-hand with recognizing its surface level gameplay. 

The concept of merging the genres of idler and roguelike is genuinely worth exploring - what is unfortunate is that Vampire Survivors seems more intent to demonstrate and glorify it than undergo any such exploration. You might forget you’re playing a “roguelike,” the only element of the game that is random (and also the only element within the player’s control) are the weapons offered with each level-up. As aforementioned, your choice in items will have so little bearing on the outcome of your run that they may as well also simply be handed to you.

The developer team is devoted to continually providing new updates to the game, hopefully they are eventually able to properly expand upon the concept and add more to the game than additional functionally identical items and stages, which has been the case for several (paid) updates. Vampire Survivors can be additionally commended for its music, and humor.",1707877548,1707877548,False,1,1,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

With the disclaimer out of the way... While I am all for roguelike games, this just did not scratch that itch in the slightest. The loop is simple enough to master, and once you figure out what you like to use the most, you just end up spending the rest of the time unlocking weapon combos/characters etc.

So, why did I buy it and not just immediately ask for a refund once I realized I wasn't really having fun? The ratings for one, this is a lot of people's favorite game/style of game. Also, saw a bunch of Youtubers with gameplay videos and they just sounded like they were having so much fun... Also of course cost.

Maybe I would have more fun if it didn't feel so time-gated? Or if the upgrades (aside from character passives) felt like they really made a difference, looking at you To The Core. Not that collectively you don't get more powerful, it's all just really RNG based until you figure out the loop and can start farming chests.

In conclusion, not a bad game, but not one that I would recommend to anyone like-minded. Cheers!",1707715304,1707715304,False,2,0,0.462841540575027466,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I mostly ignored roguelikes but the meta progression makes a world of difference.  The trailers show you exactly what to expect as things start to get crazy. It is comparable to a clicker, but without the hand-strain (so, enjoyable).  

I played through much of the base game on android.  When an official Linux release was published, I bought it on Steam along with the available DLCs.

The creators of this game have developed a formula for being one of the most addictive games ever made; Such as the use of bright colours, numerous gems to collect, and as you upgrade your weaponry, there is the satisfaction of killing hundreds of enemies coming at you simultaneously. Another aspect of the game being so good is the achievement hunting.

I like to obtain the game achievements, and I find this the most fun part of the game. There are so many achievements that add to my satisfaction.

 Overall this is a fantastic game with endless re-plays. Also great if you want something reasonably quick to play.

I stumbled upon it after watching Asmongold struggle through it, and I was hooked by the sheer challenge.

For a while, the game lived up to its reputation, providing a satisfyingly tough experience that justified every penny spent. I relished the endgame battles, especially the epic showdowns with Death every 30 minutes, a feat I accomplished with Leda just like Asmongold did in his video.

However, revisiting the game left me feeling uninspired. While updates introduced some welcome improvements, such as upgrades for the clock lancet and laurel, they also unbalanced the game dynamics. The once intriguing Arcana mechanic lost its charm with the addition of scaling, tipping the scales too heavily in favor of the player.

As I reached god-like levels of power in the endgame, the thrill of replayability vanished, leaving me with a sense of closure rather than anticipation. While my review may lean towards the negative, it's worth noting that I did spend 200 hours in the game, which speaks to its initial appeal.

It's flashy, it's simple to pick up and play, has a decent sense of progression, and the luck based power up system is alluring. Coupled with catchy music and tons of unlocks, and the dollar to playtime is unbeatable! The production quality is also surprisingly nice.

Pros:
-Very affordable
-Tons of unlocks
-Catchy music
-Nice sound effects

Cons
-enemies play exactly the same
-Visuals can obscure the screen
-Adventures Mode seems like an unnecessary game within a game mechanic, despite added story.

Gameplay wise, it's a topdown action game where you defeat enemies to get EXP in order to level up your weapons. There's a time limit, and you have to survive for that long in order to clear the stage. Your character attacks automatically. Every time you level up, the game gives your 3-5 random choices to level up, whether it be a new weapon, a weapon upgrade, or new passives. You can ""evolve"" weapons if you have the right combination of weapon and passives and it's such a blast trying to strategize what build or weapon to go for depending on the choices you get. it's that sort of ""gambling"" element that makes it addicting at times. You'll always remember that one perfect run where you get everything you need. Then, you get a really bad match, you curse the RNG, and retry again, hoping to get a better shot at it. There are special mobs which drop chests and are extremely helpful, and they're the only way to fully upgrade a weapon.

Most of the enemies will always go towards you. Some will have projectiles but their main form of attack is to simply touch you.

The game is meant to be replayed over and over, and contains a Power Up menu that let's you buy permanent in-game upgrades. They make a huge difference. From moving faster, to getting more EXP, to regenerating health, it makes you feel stronger and better, enticing you to keep playing the game. In the game are also Relics. These add additional gameplay or QoL elements such as endless mode, picking the stage music, shorter stage timer, and my favorite: Aracana mode. This one adds a bunch of goofy gimmicks and gameplay elements that completely change the game. Game Killer and Suor Clerici. That's all I'm going to say.

Story wise, there's not much to it. You're a survivor in search of a vampire. The Bestiary and stage description reveal bits of lore and world building but nothing too solid. Adventure Mode also provides some character motivations and expands what the Bestiary already says.

But the game does get a bit boring after awhile after realizing there's not much to it beyond the exciting visuals and sounds.

Each character has their own unique starting weapon and different passives. Some are faster, others are tankier.  But overall, every character feels more or less the same, barring a few, with very weird gimmicks or large hitboxes. 

As you play through the game, you'll unlock more stages. They vary from difficulty, and the difficulty isn't linear. Sometimes, the stage you unlock will be easier than the previous one. One stage will have deliberate enemy mixups that make you think on your feet, countering defensive players, while also forcing offensive players to rely on some sort of survivability.  Other times, the stage will be an absolute breeze for the next 20 minutes, then it floods you with incredibly tanky monsters.

And all of this asskicking wouldn't be complete without kickass music. I'm not a musician, but they're catchy, straightforward, and get stuck in your head. My favorites are Red and Blue, Castle People, Moms are Tough, and It's Raining Minotaurs.  There's an okay variety of synthy music, with some DnB and heavy electronic elements. I like that a lot of them sound so 2000s with the MIDI. Some just sound straight up Castlevania. Other tracks sound like homages to other video game series or composers, like Dark Souls (PLIN PLIN PLON) Hatoshi Sakimoto (Final Fantasy Tactics, FF12, and Muramasa The Demon Blade) to even Yoko Shimomura (Kingdom Hearts, Live A Live). It's all so nerdy, but even if you don't know some of the puns and references, they don't take away from how awesome the music is. Speaking of references-

The game has lots of references to Italian culture. No surprise because it's made by an Italian. It adds a bit of flavor and exoticism imo. As an American anyway! From pop-culture references to dumb puns, it's a tip of the iceberg from another culture. For example, there's a character named, ""Poe Racho"" which is a pun of the Italian word, ""Poveraccio"". A poor or trashy person. Another are the names ""Belpaese"" and ""Christine Davain"". Bel Paese means, Beautiful Country in Italian, and Christine D'avena is a famous Italian singer. Also, cheese. LOTS of cheese references. Get it? Because it's Italian and players are trying to cheese the game to get the best results possible?

All in all, there are worse ways to spend $3. At worst it's just mental stimulation.; it may not be ""fun"" but it keeps you occupied and makes you feel something. At best, it's a simple, wonderful game that's a feast for the eyes and ears. Buy this game.",1707034848,1707034848,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Other notes:
-Chest animations being un-skip-able got old in the 1st 2 hours
-The hit boxes are not what they seem visually, treat it like TF2 melee, except the sever ping isnt there so the excuses lack for VS.
-Hyper mode made the maps i did play it with feel better but that's cause it's not a snails pace.
-the 30 min rounds leave you sitting with nothing to do for 18 mins most times cause maxing out will only really take 12 to 15 mins to do. 
-Holocure is free and with actual interaction in the game play.

Don't buy this at full price, $3.00 or less is best.
Could work as a time waster like many people talk about but wanting to ""play"" a game is counter intuitive for what this title offers.

Play sessions for first time players typically start off slow, but as you progress through the game it gets more challenging, more active and much harder. Sessions typically last about 30 minutes after playing and unlocking things, so it never feels like it drags out too bad. The music is hella good and the action is just super entertaining if you're into rogulikes. It's definitely a good time waster game if you're just looking for something relatively casual to play.

The devs have been working hard to make sure this game stays pretty fresh and fun. A lot of updates involve new characters, wepaons, upgrades, maps, even some mechanics and it just keeps coming. I don't think I've ever found this game becoming stale because of it. The amount of care they put into this game is amazing ESPECIALLY FOR A $5 USD PRICE POINT! You get so much more than what it's actually worth. I've pumped in just over 20 hours on this game and still come back to it a lot of times when i just need something to do!

In this game, players select a character and survive against hordes of supernatural enemies, continuously upgrading their abilities and weapons to withstand the ever-increasing difficulty. 

Gameplay Mechanics
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
The core gameplay of Vampire Survivors is deceptively simple, focusing on movement as players automatically attack incoming waves of enemies. The simplicity of the controls belies the depth of strategy involved, particularly in weapon and power-up selections, character positioning, and timing for using special items. This minimalist approach makes the game accessible to a wide range of players while still offering a challenging experience for those looking to maximize efficiency and reach the later stages of the game.

Progression System
Rating: 8/10 - Good
Vampire Survivors features a progression system that rewards both short-term and long-term play. Throughout each run, players collect experience to level up, choosing upgrades from a randomized selection to enhance their character's abilities. Additionally, the game incorporates a meta-progression system, allowing players to unlock new characters, weapons, and passive enhancements that persist across runs. This system encourages experimentation with different builds and strategies, though it can feel grindy at times as players work to unlock all available options.

Visual and Audio Presentation
Rating: 7/10 - Good
The game's visual presentation is minimalist, featuring pixel-art graphics that pay homage to classic 8-bit and 16-bit games. While the visuals are not groundbreaking, they suit the game's straightforward gameplay and add to its retro charm. The audio, consisting of catchy chiptune tracks and satisfying sound effects, complements the action well, enhancing the overall experience. However, more variety in both visuals and audio could further improve the game's immersive qualities.

Replayability
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
Vampire Survivors excels in replayability, thanks to its randomized progression system, a wide array of unlockable content, and the inherently addictive nature of its gameplay loop. Each run feels distinct, with different weapon and power-up combinations leading to unique playstyles and challenges. The game's difficulty curve and the lure of unlocking new characters and abilities keep players coming back for ""just one more run,"" making it a perfect game for both short bursts and longer play sessions.

Overall Entertainment Value
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
Vampire Survivors offers an exceptional entertainment value, especially considering its status as an indie game. Its simple yet addictive gameplay, combined with a deep progression system and high replayability, ensures that players will spend hours trying to master its challenges. The game's straightforward mechanics make it easy to pick up but hard to put down, striking a perfect balance between accessibility and depth.

Overall Summary and Recommendation:
Vampire Survivors is a standout title in the roguelike genre, offering a refreshingly simple yet deeply engaging gameplay experience. Its success lies in its ability to hook players with its straightforward mechanics, then keep them engaged with its complex progression system and high replayability. 

Highly Recommended for fans of roguelike games and those seeking a challenging yet accessible gaming experience. Vampire Survivors is a testament to the idea that simplicity, coupled with well-designed gameplay mechanics, can lead to a highly rewarding and enjoyable game, promises endless hours of fun and satisfaction with best value for money.",1706916581,1706916581,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gonna have to call it a VS like i guess.

I know theirs been more before it but Brotato has been the only one that has really come close to this masterpiece.

Rules for this game.

1. Turn the music off and put on your best tunes in the background... i use spotify.
2. Get very drunk.
3. Make sure if you have a job its not a Sunday!!

Nothing taking away from the awesome soundtrack by the way.

Its such an amazing game.

If anyone told me i could play a game without pressing a button and id love it id say there mental.

So people only play it because it has some addictive progression mechanisms?  Nope!  This isn't Cookie Clicker.  (I tend toward big-brained games.  I've beaten Factorio solo 5 times and scored 30 consecutive wins in Shenzhen Solitaire, however) Vampire Survivors has a very good amount of depth of strategy (not extreme though) combined with excellently-tuned progression mechanisms.
10/10, would recommend to anyone.. anyone, that is, who is completely immune to addiction.  If you have any propensity to get addicted to anything, this game will eat your life.

I don't give a flying F about co-op or versus and characters are plentiful enough already.

Stuff like new stages and music are ok but what I'd really like is a freakin' qol of being able to peek at union/evolution grimoire on level up choice

You just move your character around and choose from a variety of weapons and passive items that you gather around or when you level up... it sounds so simple and yet it´s so adicting.

I got all the achievements so I longer play Vampire Survivors or/and do crack. Instead I wake up early and go to Will Ferrell movies to laugh when everybody laughs hoping the darkness of the movie cinema hides my tears and are confused with a laughing cry and at night a voice in my head keep asking ""why is it call Vampire Survivors if there are no vampires and you can´t really survive unless in endless mode?""

I should point out this review is neither an invitation to either do crack or buy Vampire Survivors, but if you must do one or the other, I suggest Vampire Survivors, it´s as cheap as crack but a one time purchase and your skin and teeth will thank you for it.

Original

I mainly bought this just to see what all the fuss way about. People rating it ""Game of the Year!!!"".

I figured it MUST be good!

In my opinion, it's not.

It lacks skill. Nearly all of the abilities you gain are random, so you can go in with a plan, and have it completely thrown out the window. You also can't turn down upgrades most of the time, so each run is random.

I've been playing on my Steam Deck, and I actually get thumb fatigue because I pretty much have to hold it in the same direction for at least 6 minutes straight, because I'm heading towards a coffin I want to open.

It's fantastic for people with disabilities, as it's nice for everyone to be able to play this game. However, there are significantly better games for people out there.

The fact people chose this as their game of the year over something like Elden Ring (Which I hate, by the way) and God of War is completely surprising to me.",1672842727,1706551995,True,0,0,0.496836632490158081,0,True,False,False

If i'd have to ask for anything at all, is that i'd love more complexity to it, more weapons, multiple evolutions to the already established ones, other than the arbitrary stat changes that arcanas seem to present.

 But the fact that i just can't get enough of the game proves that its... Low key perfect... I mean, there are slight bugs that get you stuck and some mechanics like the cats aren't fun nor intuitive early and just turn to a featureless max damage field at max level, before the ""devolving"" into something a little more utility based, somewhat like garlic was before the change.

It keeps getting better the higher levels you gain and by better I mean a large amount. It's exponential progression and respectful of the time you put into it so if you are pressed on time, this is the one. You will need a strategy guide or tons of trial and error to figure out how to break the game. Look up the strategy guide on steamlists by darkwell is a good place to start, it is a dps focused guide and cleanly laid out.

The highest priority when you first start the game is to farm for gold on the inlaid library map, which is the second map you unlock. Buy the best power ups for the amount of gold you have. Gold for power ups is refundable, so no worries, keep upgrading your selections, then when you make more gold, refund and reinvest, repeat. You will need 10-20k gold roughly for late game to plow through enemies. It doesn't take too long.

The characters you should make a priority to purchase are Imelda then Arca, after that, Mortaccio.

You will need to be good at kiting enemies, very similar to black ops zombies. When you select the right weapon/item combinations in game, you will beat the level and plow through enemies. Once you have enough gold for power ups, are good at kiting, good at weapon/item selection, then you will be able to beat the level over and over and get better scores. Beating the level in this game means you are on a 30min timer, survive the whole 30 and you will see a results screen that shows you your stats. The faster you are at plowing through enemies, the better your results will be. The stats results page gives you a lot of info, I usually screenshot it and compare to my previous runs or other's runs.

The first map will be likely make you feel frustrated, though eager to try over and over. The initial goal is to get rich or die trying, literally. You will need to die many times before you have farmed enough gold from map 1 to be able to plow through enemies nonstop and survive. It doesn't take too long.

---

Pros: 
Everything is done right. It will make you eager to advance to the next levels even if you get frustrated, upgrade your characters and power ups.

Cons:
Initial frustration may discourage you and make you feel like late game isn't going to happen anytime soon and you will need to grind forever. Don't worry, this isn't the case, it will happen much faster if you follow a guide.

Overall:
It has hidden content.
Definitely worth full price.
This is the game. You found it. Have fun

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

At first glance, it plays like a super shallow ""idle"" ARPG where the only thing you have to do is move around while your character automatically attacks. The game deceives you into thinking it will be boring, but then you become absolutely overwhelmed with enemies and start having to approach each run differently to get further and further.

Almost every aspect of this game is made to be incrementally more plentiful as you play. Speed, damage, variety of items you can find, modifiers to those items, variety of playable characters with unique buffs, even the amount of enemies you'll fight. At times, Vampire Survivors will play like a bullet hell, sometimes like an ARPG, and even a Doom/Dynasty Warriors style game where you mow down colossal hordes of enemies. There is an absurd amount of progression and different styles of play. What seems like a simple game at first, eventually becomes deep with an enormous range of builds and ways to tweak those builds.

As for aesthetics, the music is utterly [b]fantastic[/b], and while the art style is pretty basic with limited animations, you'll find that it far more than suffices when you have hundreds of enemies on the screen at once. That being said, the weapon effect animations are about as pleasing to the eye as you could every hope for with such simple pixellated graphics.

When Vampire Survivors released it was practically a new concept combining the likes of similar games that came before it to create what became known as reverse bullet-hells or bullet heavens as I prefer, where instead of facing an onslaught of projectiles like in the latter genre of bullet hells, you become the bullet hell in that your weapons fire independently of your input and that the enemies must instead make it through your bullets to get to you.

Releasing a game like this that is so simple yet so addicting and easily and quickly updatable, all for an insanely low price releasing at £2.47, inspired a huge variety of developers to dip their hand into this genre and create their own spin on the idea, a lot of which are still expanding to the time of this review as well as new games in the genre releasing almost weekly. Not only did this inspiration help developers in that the concept was so simple to recreate, but players also received a huge influx of cheap and easy to pick-up roguelike/lites. Poncle updated Vampire Survivors weekly to bi-weekly for the better part of a year after it's release, playing during this time was practically like playing a different game each week, updates have slowed down to every few months now but that's down to the immense growth of the game and higher quality of each update with Themed DLC's and more intricate maps.

[b][h2]Gameplay[/h2][/b]In Vampire Survivors, you select a character, select a map and you are into the gameplay within just a couple of clicks. Each character starts with a weapon which fires on its own without your input. By killing enemies you gain exp, you level up and choose up to 6 weapons and passive buff items throughout a run, with the whole goal of becoming strong enough to hold out for 30 minutes against endless hoards of enemies. The game released with 4 characters and only a handful of weapons but now has almost 60 unique characters and over 80 weapons (including each weapons evolution) alongside 20+ passives that you can mix and match throughout your runs. Weapon evolutions are practically super enhanced versions of the base weapon that are gotten from chests after your weapon reaches max level in a run, depending on the passives you pick, no one weapon will act the exact same between multiple runs, with systems in place to let you limit-break your weapons beyond max level, choosing different stats will make for completely different playstyles with the same weapons. You can also choose to limit the number of weapons you can take in a run and super power only your favourites with limit-break.

With that being said, the game is basically infinitely replayable as long as you are having fun. Each character includes a page showing which maps you have beaten with them, and with 17 regular maps that works out to a total of 986 runs you can do if you want to be a completionist.

As of this review there are 18 maps total in the game, including challenge levels, DLC stages and Boss Fights, each play completely differently and have a variety of challenges/achievements, special unlocks and hidden items, all of which can be customised to your own liking with modifiers that can reduce total game time from 30 minutes to 15, speed up movement, increase difficulty, make runs endless and more.

One thing Vampire Survivors gets right that a lot of the games proceeding it do not, is a real sense of progression, While a lot of the maps are similar endless plains with few obstacles, the enemies on the maps get more difficult as you play through making it harder to complete each subsequent map which makes you really have to learn what weapons work with what passives and which combine to create a huge damage zone that enemies cannot enter. All unlocks are tied to maps and achievements which make for an experience where you start with very little when you start the game but as you progress map to map finding secrets, you unlock new in game features that drastically change how the game plays, like all the map modifiers mentioned earlier, mini-maps and a whole lot more.

Now of course this game is a roguelite so there is also a page for meta-progression, you collect coins throughout your runs which allows you to upgrade each individual stat in the game that will apply to any character when you pick them, there are also ways here to increase the difficulty further for those looking for the extra challenge. All of these can be disabled or reset at will outsides of runs.

[b][h2]Achievements (196/196)[/h2][/b]It's impossible to avoid the achievements in Vampire Survivors as all of them are tied to in-game unlocks in some way or another, the majority of them are easily unlocked just by playing with all the different characters and weapons, there are a certain few that require you to find secrets or kill a certain amount of enemies that only spawns in a certain location, but given how big this game has gotten there are countless guides out there detailing all of it.

Given that this game has 2 DLCs now, it is important to mention that they are [u]Both Required[/u] to 100% complete the games achievements, while I am usually apposed to DLCs having achievements, their price is so low at £1.59 each, for handcrafted new maps and a bunch more unique weapons, boss fights etc, that its worth the money on top of the base game.

[b][h2]Music/sound[/h2][/b]The music and sound design in this game is amazing, I mean this game even has it's own Orchestra now. Each map has multiple sound tracks that can play, which leads to the game currently containing 50 music tracks including the DLCs that you can choose from before you start a run, These songs will be sped up and slowed down based on the mode you are playing, basically sounding like different songs altogether.

[b][h2]TL;DR[/h2][/b]This game is a must play if you are into Roguelikes or want to get into the genre, it has tonnes of content and near infinite replayability all for an insanely cheap price.

You don't control the firing of your weapons, only your characters' movement, which can be a bit strange at first, but adds a lot of depth for me, as weapon cooldown and which combinations of weapons/items you pick can make up for that lack of control.

The first few levels can seem very difficult, especially with just the whip to start with, but keep at it, and remember, you don't have to win to unlock new things; even a failed run can earn you some really useful stuff.  

The art style is fun, and my older machine (Xeon E5-2643 3.5ghz, GTX 1060 mini 6gb, 32gb ram) can run it just fine without any slowdown, even when the screen is completely full of monsters and projectiles.

In my opinion, this game is just about perfect for parents or late night workers; the 30 minute time limit on levels is a perfect bite sized gaming experience, and won't keep you up all night.  Although the ""one more run"" factor is pretty high!

Try to avoid watching or reading too much about it when first starting out; the game has built in clues, upgrade guides, and other reference stuff to help you out, but half the fun of it is trying new weapon/item/character/level combinations and seeing what you like best.  That said, some things can be a real bear to figure out without help, so it's good there is such a vibrant community for this game.

The value for money on this one is out of this world, and I definitely recommend grabbing the DLCs, as they add a ton to the game.

The castlevania feel of the whole thing is great, as a CV fan will spot lots of references to it, ranging from the subtle to blatant.  The 2d sprite style is also easy on the eyes.  HOWEVER, this is one game where I would take the epilepsy warning very seriously, once you become powerful, some weapons generate a LOT of flashing lights.

As for downsides, some levels feel far harder than others, but with experimentation I've usually been able to find a build that works.  Some of the snowy levels still frustrate me, but that can be a positive thing too, keep me experimenting to find new ways to deal with them.

I know I'm heaping praise on this game, and it may not be for everyone, but it really works well for me, and I think most all folks can get some enjoyment out of it.

to make it clear - I WANT TO LIKE THIS GAME. i've bought every DLC and sunk in two hours. i don't have this problem in 20 Minutes Till Dawn or Death Must Die where i get unlucky for 5 minutes straight and die repeatedly. it's being offered for a good price, and from what i see by twitch streams and others experiences it's supposed to be good, but the key to enjoying this game is luck and if you don't have luck i suppose your custom isn't welcome? the soundtrack is good, the visuals are charming. i can't speak to how well it runs because i've never made it past the 5 minute mark.

in case the developer reads this, the one piece of constructive feedback i can offer? i haven't seen any stage past the first one given survival is impossible, but that first stage is hell on my eyes - blind in one eye with failing eyesight,  the visual palette combined with the visual noise makes the game physically painful for me to play. not colourblind but more options to visually customise the game to make it readable would be appreciated. ultrawide support too would be nice. also i have no idea how to open the map, i know one exists in the game but i can't see keybinds in the options menu anywhere.

i'm not going to refund the game - i will continue to play, see if i can get lucky on a run eventually and see what the game offers. will update my recommendation if it changes at any time. maybe one more run and it won't be a miserable experience. and if not? there's always the next run.",1705878899,1705878899,False,0,2,0,1,True,False,False

It's a game that mesmerizes with its simplicity yet hides layers of depth and endless possibilities. Each run feels like a new adventure, with myriad combinations of powers and weapons that can completely change your playstyle.

The game's design is ingeniously straightforward, focusing on survival against hordes of nightmarish creatures. But don't let its apparent simplicity fool you; the strategic depth here is immense. Deciding which power-ups to pick, which character to use, and how to navigate the relentless waves of enemies makes each session unique and exhilarating.

What's truly hypnotic about Vampire Survivors is the game's rhythm. There's something incredibly satisfying and almost meditative about mowing down endless hordes of enemies while progressively becoming more powerful.

-great sound design

The bad:
-can get stale once you've started upgrading character/global stats unless you modify to make more difficult
-the trial and error to figure out certain secrets/combinations can get frustrating if you don't want to look them up, especially if you get to a point where you're more likely to make it to the 30 minute mark than not

This game is a wild ride into the heart of roguelike gaming, offering an addictive blend of heart-pounding action and strategic depth. The diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique abilities, adds a layer of excitement and experimentation. The procedurally generated levels keep the gameplay fresh, but sometimes the pixelated chaos can be overwhelming, making those intense moments a bit of a struggle. The responsive controls, however, allow for some seriously slick moves during the heated battles. For newcomers, be prepared for a bit of a learning curve as the game throws a lot at you, but the thrill of mastering each character and conquering the challenges is undeniably rewarding. Despite a few visual hiccups and a tough start for beginners, this hilarious game is a blood-pumping, action-packed adventure that's hard to put down, making it a must-try for roguelike enthusiasts looking for a challenge and a good time.",1705617722,1705617722,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The price is right, and will net you a good 20+ hours of addictive survival as you try to last 30 minutes against increasingly powerful hoards of enemies.  Be tactical with your upgrade choices, or you will very quickly find yourself overwhelmed.  Best part, you don't need a particularly powerful PC to run this beauty.

Lots of unlockables: new characters, better weapons, item fusion combinations, and even arcana cards to completely switch up your playstyle or augment some of your favorite elements.  Many of these upgrades can be enabled/disabled at will in the options menu to further customize your experience.

The major downside is that many of the levels can feel identical as far as progression and power creep: walk around, level up, gain new powerups, while fighting increasingly numerous waves of tougher enemies   But each stage brings its own new unique power ups, enemies, and stage hazards to the table to balance things out.  

If you have no patience for gameplay which feels repetitive and involves basically just walking around (attacking is done automatically), give this one a pass.  But if the premise sounds interesting and you are looking for another low-demand gem to add to your library, have at it.",1705613762,1705613762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My first ever roguelite and it was extremely fun. Coming up with different builds of weapons and perks was amazing as the weapons can evolve depending on the perks you pick. It was fun seeing how crazy you can make the game become depending on all these interactions and stats in terms of kill rate and enemy spawn rate. The different enemy and level designs as well as bosses and story events you experience all add to the game's charm.

I never liked roguelite/like games due to not liking having to start over from the beginning upon death, but after buying a steamdeck and seeing this game recommended due to it being steam deck verified, I jumped into this game blind. I did not regret it.

The game has opened me up to trying the genre out more and would recommend anyone pick this game up. Its free on mobile iirc and regularly goes on sale on other platforms.

Some people like or don't like the pixel graphics, but it does ooze with a classic Castelvania style. These are perfect Steam Deck games as you can play an entire session in a very short amount of time and will hardly drain your battery.

It has a ton of content, constantly being updated, reasonably priced DLC, and has 4-player co-op. It is not my personal favorite in the genre, but it is certainly in my top 3 and is THE standard in games like this.

20 minutes later you have no idea what the hell is happening on the screen anymore but it doesn't matter. The numbers go up and the colors on the screen increase. Eventually it all ends when an invincible grim reaper collides into you at Mach 10.

And then you do it again.

You realize there are secrets to be found. You realize the grim reaper can be killed. And you do it again, and again, and again, and again, and before you know it there are no more things to upgrade, nor to grind for. No more characters to unlock. No map that hasn't been crawled across in every manner possible. Then you find 'adventure mode', which is essentially a standalone 'gamemode' with minor twists where you grind to unlock all the same characters and powerups again on different maps.

And then you do it again.

Soon I will eventually clear the adventure modes and have nothing left to unlock yet again, no reason to keep playing, staring into a color-filled void as I watch a number go up. How many times will I continue this cycle? When does it end?

And yet despite almost 100 percent clearing everything this game has to offer, I still haven't found a single vampire.

It starts super slow and weak but gives you a path towards getting stronger and stronger. The more characters unlocked leads to more weapons unlocked which then leads to methods of manipulating the weapons that show up in the run. This type of scaling continues for the whole base game. There even is a way to brute force past challenges with a purchasable stat boosting item. The best DLC was Tides of the Foscari though compared to base game the weapons are OP and will make any base game weapons look bad.

Pros:
-Amazing progression and unlocking system
-Tools to play the game your way
-Time respecting hyper and rush modes that halve run length.
-A good amount of weapon variety and addon item variety

Cons:
-some of the late game things basically require reading the wiki to determine locations of enemies or what level the next part of the ""end"" lives on.
-the secret characters are OP to the point of making non secret characters redundant outside of picking your starting weapon. Even a 400x egg main character is weaker than most of the secret characters.
-The shop could have used more upgrades not necessarily for character strength but to augment other systems such as the vendor.

While all you do is move around the massive stages and let the auto-shooting kill enemies as damage numbers go up, this is like saying all DaVinci did was put paint on canvas. Choosing the right power-ups to create OP combinations isn't just fun, it's vital to surviving the last 10-minutes of each 30-minute stage, where your feeling of godlike power is put to the test and the free space to move gets smaller and smaller. The most fun I've had without using my higher brain functions and proof you should never go to a casino if this is your jam. Can't believe this is only $8 with DLC. A less ethical developer would have it at $30 and I'd still pay for it.

Vampire Survivors is basically a roguelite bullet hell game that enemies are the bullets. But it’s not the charming effect of the game. It uses some of the bright and addicting ideas from other games, and shows us all how to create a good game with just game mechanics with minimum effort. I’m saying minimum effort because when you see the visuals and the gameplay aspect of the game you realise how basic and simple these aspects are. At first glance I wasn’t sold into the game, because of the visual aspect. But after playing it once you’ll get addicted to playing it.

The gameplay consists of moving in the basic directions to avoid enemies and combining the randomly given weapons/abilities. It has run based gameplay. Each run you start with the selected character and level. They have 30 minutes for you to successfully complete them, and the levels have some secret areas for you to explore.  From this simple explanation you can guess the attractive part of the game with ease. You have 6 slots for weapons and abilities each. Most of the weapons have a second phase. In order to unlock that phase, you need to combine it with respected ability. The came have quests or you to complete. Completing these quests gives you the feeling of accomplishment but more importantly it gives permanent characters, gifts, or weapons/abilities. So, you have another reason to try the new equipment you obtained. Explore new synergies to create with other combinations. On top of these each unlocked character has their own passive abilities, stats and starting weapons. Furthermore, the game doesn’t stop here, you unlock tarot cards at some point that give good buffs to some weapons. In the end I hope I was able to let you see how many mechanics the game presents to make you play it repeatedly.

The game thematically and visually is homage to some titles. Some of these titles are Castlevania, Bayonetta. In addition, it just added some characters with stereotypes such as knight, ranger and mage and it just revealed the last expansion pack is with a well-known game Among Us. These additions and reminiscence of other games are cherry on the top of a well-prepared game. Last thing I want to praise about the game is there are some meta jokes and meta gameplay tricks that hit you pretty good. There are not much of them, but because of this they’re impactful, and more fun to encounter than most meta game’s that tries the same thing.

Finally, I can easily recommend this game to anyone that tries to see what makes a game playable and spend a good time on it. One of the issues I have with the game is it visually unappealing and visual effects become tiresome at some point, because of the intensity of spells that are seen on screen. Another problem is I know it shouldn’t be a problem but the game doesn’t allow you to take a break. In a way it doesn’t respect your time if you don’t respect that time as well. Each run takes around 30 minutes without using any level modifications, and the rewards the game usually gave you trigger you to play another round.",1703191907,1705236914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At the moment there are 18 characters each with their own unique weaponry and passive buffs. Theres an upgrade menu where you spend coins you earn during gameplay to upgrade your characters before starting a stage, giving you a good head start and allowing you to become more powerful. The coins you earn in game are also used to purchase new characters that you've unlocked with a corresponding achievement.

The game starts slow and kind of difficult as you will have no power ups to go into a stage with. The starting characters you are given fire in random directions except for Antonio and Gennaro. You'll want to pick one of these two characters until you progress a little. As the others are very frustrating since you cannot control where the attacks go. You will run around randomly hoping it will kill the mobs blocking you from the EXP Orbs but mostly to no avail.

I would say you could get around 15-30 hours with this game. Completing all the stages, achievements, and unlocking all the characters. Which is excellent considering the price.

The only two things I would of done differently is allowing the player to attack manually or automatically. Sometimes its better to let the mobs get closer so you don't need to run as much to get the orbs. The powerup menu I would of done differently too. If you have enough coins its possible to purchase EVERY powerup. I think making it more methodical and having to choose which ones you want over others would of been better. Making the player really think about which powerups are best for each character they choose. Overall I would give it 5 stars, it's all about fun and multiplying your power.

It's one of the few games that gives you the sense of achievement after beating a boss or a stage but instead of most games that gives you that feeling once or twice, the game allow you to re-experience that feeling multiple times.

Despite this game just being bullet-hell and stuff, it's gonna require using your brain to solve puzzles and find the perfect strategy to beat a specific stage with given RNG items, even if you lost, you're not that upset and happy to play more cause what you gain from previous run aid you in the next.

Vampire Survivors is a rogue-like survival game where you kill thousands of monsters in order to become an unstoppable force of weapons and spells. The game is highly addictive, and despite the visuals not looking the finest, it fits the aesthetic that I believe Poncle had in mind.

There is a good progression system, in that by exploring maps and levelling up weaponry, you unlock more maps and weaponry to try out in another run. Weapons and passive abilities can combine to make evolved versions of said weapons, and it's good fun discovering all of the evolution combinations.

The game runs superbly well; I only encountered frame drops about 3 hours into each run, so I would say it has been very well optimised. With a huge amount of content in game to explore,new content being added here and there and a fun gameplay experience, it's a must-buy game at its low cost.",1700996317,1705022240,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is pretty much a horde mode type of game where your only input (outside of menus) is moving and selecting upgrades when you level up. There are several levels and characters you can choose from. A lot have to be unlocked and some are surprisingly well hidden if you don't have a guide. Also the OST is really neat but whatever song you start with on a level, it repeats until the match is over. Lastly, there are next to no load screens and between booting up the game and a match is almost instant!

I highly recommend this game! It is cheap (so is the dlc) and very fun! Also to those that are photosensitive, the flashing lights during certain bits of the game can get intense even for me.

Creating a compelling loop and deep strategy with the simplest controls imaginable sounds like a big ask, but VS manages it beautifully.  I could give this game to my 80 year old arthritic grandmother with confidence that she could manage it.  I could also give this game to my L33T gamer nephew with the knowledge that it may very well take over his life. 

 I've personally poured over 100 hours into this game (most of it on switch), and I could easily pour in 100 more and be glad.

Vampire Survivors perhaps produces more dopamine per minute than any other game I've played.  It works on a deep, lizard-brain level.  The second to second action is engaging without being overtaxing, and the constant pursuit of the right concoction of weapons and upgrades to create a game-shattering build is the video game equivalent of heroin.  Once you understand the synergies that exist in this game, you will come back to it over and over.

At first I was put off by the visuals, but the need for simplicity makes itself obvious once you've got hundreds of things happening on the screen simultaneously.  My PC is grateful.  And VS runs well on everything, even the iOS version.

On top of all of this, the base game (which is all I have experienced so far; I'm adding the DLC to my cart while I write this) is $5! Insane value.  Even if you are certain that you will hate this game, it's worth risking 5 bucks to be sure.

Whilst the game mechanics are pretty simply; you just control where your characters moves, the other other mechanics keep each run fresh. You have to pick up gems that build up your experience, and at each level cap you can pick from a selection or random weapons or powerups. 

The real goal here is to max out your weapons and make sure you have the relevant powerups to evolve your weapons. You can also sometimes combine weapons. In order to expand your inventory of weapons you have unlock new characters. But there is also a lot more. You can unlock special cards that effect game play and level up characters to increase stats. There is also a bunch of hidden characters that can only be unlocked by achieving certain goals (ever tried killing the Grim Reaper that attacks you at the end of each stage?).

I've seen some reviews that say that it's too easy and repetitive. However, if someone has only thrown 3-4 hours into the game and never really pushed themselves on through the different levels, they have not really experienced how hard some of the later levels get. You need to level up you characters and unlock new weapons in order to progress. 

It's dead cheap, addictive and a much deeper a game than you might think. Give it a whirl....those vampires are not going to kill themselves.",1704815432,1704815432,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once in a while, you stumble unto a video game that just peaks your interest. Wether it be the title, the synopsis or simply the visuals, there is that something that pulls you in. I was just that way when I found this game, innocently browsing the Steam Store. If someone told me I would spend more than 100 hours playing this, I would have laughed. Surely, this game can't be [i]that[/i] engrossing. I boot it up and while curious I was not expecting much, primarily due to the price. One singular dollar for a video game these days sounds like a joke you'd play on your audience. How cheap can the production of a game be that it only costs $1 for you to play? Again, my ignorance and innocence at play. Some may say that it makes me a an eternal sceptic, others that it makes me just likeable. The main screen pops up, and the pixelized figure of a man who could use a little more sunshine stares at me. Eerie but nothing to be afraid of.  I click play and choose Antonio, the man with the whip. Over the course of the following 30 minutes, hordes of classic horror creatures (except bats because bats are just animals that are associated to horror despite being mainly inoffensive to humans with the only exception being when you are turning out to be tinge too curious and getting inside their nests at night with a flashlight a few dozen times too bright for these poor little creatures) such as skeletons, werewolves, dead man walking and of course the ever oh-so-scary smiling ghosts. The mood was set, the cards were played and this game had just revealed it's true colours. Indeed, what I thought was going to be a simple, gentle ride down gimmick valley was instead going to rocket-jump my ride towards the never-ending hordes of pixels that seek to agressively hug my character until my bones are nothing but dust had finally arrived and there was no such thing as brakes, only more and more destruction. I was at the three minute mark and already my character had whipped his way through dozens and dozens of [strike]evil[/strike] bats and skeletons, all yearning for my precious crimson-coloured life juice. All seemed lost as my experience bar barely reached level 9 when I picked up an additionnal weapon. A runic weapon of some sort. A dangerously pointy and ever more destructive square whose edges could cut through even the densest materials of the known universe, perhaps. It's flight was as majestic and unpredictable as the ever-gracious Ostrich, whose legs and sheer mass wouldn't care about your feelings even if you were several feet higher than it was. For this weapon you see, had no concepts of choosing where or why it went the way it went, Perhaps operating on a different plane of existence than my protagonist ? Perhaps it's inherent qualities made it's perks and querks only irrelevent to the greater picture, a weapon designed to destroy the vile entities of the mad forest ? It bounced and bounced again in a arythmic pattern until it's duration ran out and it vanished once more into the darkness, where it would come from again...maybe one day...or a cooldown cycle. My brave hero, unconscious to the great schemes of the Runetracer (the runic weapon), trotted and plotted a brisk walk to the right and left of the fields, swining occasionally his longer-than everage whip into the corpse-enemy that ever seemed so interested into turning my poor Antonio into a much more munchable version of himself. As the combat went on, I saw on the edge of my eye, something I thought could not be. Something, adverse to the natural order of things. Could it be that this game broke the conventions of reality to bring forwards something so horrible that only a brave man with a whip could face ? As the five-minute mark struck it's deep, resonating bell with a macabre tune, a large circle of earth-bound, agressive plant-based enemies rushed on the scene of the horror, forever trapping the daring hero inside a cage of vines and teeth. Left and right, up and down the whip struck, its edges caked in mud. His boots, now covered from toe to heel in viscous earth and blood as the dead and undead threw themselves, past the barrier of plants and unto the singular man trapped within. The struggle went on for what seemed several more minutes, Antonio covered in leaves, twigs and roots, persevered through the chaos. As I saw the ring of death closing ever tighter around my neck, a new abomination had reared it's ugly head and challenged me to a combat of sanity : the one to keep it intact would win, the other would be banished. The monster had skillfully consealed it's true shape, only showing to the mortal eyes of I and Antonio, the shape of a giant, ravenous Mantis. It's bug-eyes glistening with evil intent, it's scythes sharpened and prone to viciously attack at any moment. The duel of fates went on. One blow against the fiend, rending it's legs and heavily wounding it's eldritch form was not enough to stop it's murderous gait. It shrugged off the wounds, apparently driving it ever forwards to search within itself ever more rage and fury to fuel the forges of it's animosity towards the hero, the smoke of it's ire venting from it's frame from the several orifices that failed to be consealed. As the hour seemed lost, the strike of the creature inevitable, one final blow struck the foe where it could not ignore the pain and with a shriek, fell apart, it's shape devoured by the cosmos, turned into nothing more than what it was made of : dust from the stars. Antonio, bruised and battered was victorious. His wounds barely able to close as his life bar was nearly depleted. His vision, a blurry haze of colors, some green, some red, all his senses overloaded. The fiend was gone but it's influence lingered inside his mind, tremors of fear and hatred coursed through his veins like parasites burning his muscles. He picked himself up and struggled to keep himself from falling, the ground, treacherous as ever, had strained his balance to the point of being unable to stand straight anymore. As the air cleared and the visions of the creature vanished, more foes from far into the mist of his tired sight appeared once more. The enemy had been felled, but the greater foe had not said it's last word. Antonio first felt like he had given his all. Truely, what could be worse than the very ground coming seemingly to life to gnaw and bite at him ? The howling and heavy breathing of a wolfish shape came into view. It's fur waving in the wind as it's yellow, piercing eyes broke the monotony of the fog. Antonio gathered it's strength, lifted his whip triumphantly as a Runecaster flew off his chest. For once since the very start of his quest, the magic weapon finally seemed to understand the threat. It flew true, towards the menace, it's edges shining in the uneasy light. The shape's advance seemed to waver, it's confidence in it's wolfish agility and speed ever more in doubt. Could it be ? Could it be that this mindless missile knew that it's end had come ? In a desperate gambit, the wolf reared it's back legs and threw himself upwards, hoping the jump above the adversary, hoping that this [i]thing[/i] would be as dull-witted as it always was. For a second, the air stood still. Antonio's gaze fixated on the missile's trajectory. The wolf's wavy fur seemingly caught inside a time bubble, as the Runetracer missile flew towards it. Impact. The runetracer had hit something. Antonio could tell, it had bounced a final time before it vanished. Something had happened. Upon inspection, it seemed like the missile had hit, not the wolfish fiend, but the very side of a flower bed. The same flower beds that litter the forest, hiding within their neatly arranged boxes something of arbitrary value. Antonio sighed in disbeleif. The wolf sighed a sigh of releif. The hero had learned a valuable lesson today. Don't rely on runetracers to aim at anything, ever.",1704703249,1704704019,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So when I found that Steam had the full game, of course I bought it for me and my friend who told me about it. Hello  many lost hours of the night! 

One cool thing about this game is that it is self limiting,... at first.  Its just ""How Long Can You Survive?"" 
It is a dopamine rush with each upgrade you find. In my opinion, the learning by Doing is a great feature of the game.  it doesn't waste time with tutorials, and the weapons are pretty straight forward. the Shock and Awe when you realize it does something Extra is worth the time trudging through the basics.
No Run is ever the same no matter how you planned.  and the Chests, Oh My Gawd! I had a little dance I did each time I found one. 

But it only gets better when you learn what happens if you survive...

It is hard for me to say what I don't like about the game. Mechanics that had me angry at first, had me nodding my head once i realize what was actually happening and revealed that I had a LOT more control than it appeared from the start. Of course no one is happy at dying, but the way I died had me thinking how to avoid it next time so it wasn't a defeat, just a learning point.

So, becuz I'm stubborn and I like what I like, I muted the game music at first because it was different from the demo. But when my friend convinced me to listen to the level soundtracks, It elevated everything. the Music is SO Massively Epic! It is Familiar yet New, It is Holy and Sinister, it is Motivating and  Captivating and puts the fear of Des[aratopm in you and the Promise of Hope just within reach.  I dont' know who wrote this stuff but its becoming my favorite Get Shit Done music! 

I would recommend this game. It is a great gift in my opinion, a great way to spend a half hour, In and out, and totally Sparkle Joy for the brain!

I can see why this game is popular is insanely addictive, you'll sit down to do one run and next thing you know you've spent 2 and a half hours on the game. In fact the game is so addicting it took me about 13 hours to realize I wasn't having fun.

The game was presented to me as a rouge lite bullet hell, it's not, it's a clicker, were every click takes a half an hour.

 The only time it was fun was the first few runs where I was still figuring things out. After that it quickly becomes repetitive, first to 5-10 minutes you're a mortal and actually have to try. 5-15 you're a superhuman and as long you're focusing on leveling up to out-scale the enemies you're near invincible. 15-25 minutes you're a demigod who can only die if you stop moving for too long. last 20-30 minutes your a god and you can't die even if you try to, you could literally stop playing the game except for the fact auto level ups don't happen till like level 100, so you have to manually level every 10 seconds. Then death kills you, you unlock new stuff which will allow you to unlock other new stuff on your next run.

There are some variations in levels and goals, while refreshing it's still just another click, on the long roads of clicks layed out infront of you before you're allowed to beat the game

I'm pretty sure you can't actually beat the game (kill death) on the first run. Each run is about unlocking new items/characters/levels which will allow you to unlock special weapons which will allow you to beat death. It seams impossible to kill death with any combination of skills and upgrades. You have to go to a few different to unlock special items to kill death. I even tried to kill death without the special items by crafting the perfect build that would heal me and prevent death from ever reaching me, but nope after a couple of minutes of stun locking/freezing death he just teleport on top of you and kills you. Instead you have to have to use the special weapon that freezes death and stops him from teleporting.

If you're just looking to kill time, then there is no game better than this. But as I've got more games than I'll every play I want a game that provides me with a fun or satisfying experience, this game failed at  this more than any game I've played on the past decade so it just wasted my time. Perhaps the most disappointing thing is there's a good bullet hell rouge-lite in there somewhere but it's buried under 72 layers of Progress Quest.",1704572405,1704572405,False,1,0,0.427757740020751953,0,True,False,False

I didn't know what to expect when I first got into this, it was just hella cheap and I was looking for Castlevania clones, but what I found here was a truly original arcade videogame experience. Vampire Survivors does not pretend to be anything greater than what it is and yet it exceeds expectations and readily reminds me with every session, why games are so great. This game somehow melts my negative emotions away.
In the first 30 seconds, I was somewhat annoyed and disappointed that there is no button mashing involved, it's purely a joystick style game... then those 30 seconds elapsed... and then 30 hours elapsed in like a week.
What compelled me to leave a positive review now, with about half the characters and maps unlocked, was the session I just played with my 10 year old cousin. This game is just as fun solo but with local co-op, it is so simple and yet so thrilling. Nothing beats the horde survival format when it comes to gaming with others for me, whether it was Boxhead Zombies or Nazi Zombies with my childhood best friend or Gears of War horde mode with my dad, it has always created the most interesting experience of cooperative gameplay in my esperience. 
If Castlevania and Pac-Man had a child, it would be Vampire Survivors and I'm here for it. Such a great time killer and truly so much fun. Make some Kool-aid, get two controllers and plug in with a buddy to turn a boring evening into a great one with Vampire Survivors!

It's a casual game : if you make some basic good choices, everything can be pretty easy.

You have to defeats hordes of ennemies in a limited time.
Your only controls are the arrow keys (or controller) to move your character, your weapons fire automatically.

It's a refreshing game, very low price (2 DLC needed right now for the 100%, maybe the third later, but the bundle is about 10€...)

Developed by indie studio Iced Lizard Games, this title seamlessly combines retro aesthetics, strategic depth, and addictive gameplay into a concoction that's as satisfying as it is challenging.

From the pixelated art style reminiscent of classic arcade games to the pulsating chiptune soundtrack, ""Vampire Survivors"" oozes nostalgia while delivering a fresh and engaging experience. The game's simplicity is its strength, allowing you to dive right in without the need for an extensive tutorial, yet it maintains enough complexity to keep you hooked for hours.

The core mechanics are elegantly straightforward. You, a lone vampire, must survive relentless waves of enemies in procedurally generated levels. The variety of weapons, power-ups, and perks scattered throughout each run ensure that no two playthroughs are alike. The thrill of discovering a powerful new ability or stumbling upon a game-changing item adds an element of unpredictability that keeps the gameplay dynamic and exciting.

The rogue-lite elements shine through with each death, as you're rewarded with in-game currency that can be used to unlock new characters, upgrades, and items. The sense of progression is both tangible and addictive, offering a constant incentive to jump back into the fray and try out different combinations.

The strategic depth in ""Vampire Survivors"" is surprising, considering its seemingly straightforward premise. Balancing risk and reward becomes an art form as you decide whether to push deeper into the level for greater rewards or retreat to safety. The game's difficulty curve is finely tuned, providing a satisfying challenge that never feels insurmountable.

The cooperative multiplayer option adds another layer of fun to the mix, allowing you to team up with friends for chaotic and laughter-filled sessions. The synergy between different characters and their unique abilities enhances the cooperative experience, turning what could be a solitary pursuit into a social gaming delight.

While ""Vampire Survivors"" doesn't reinvent the roguelike wheel, it embraces the genre's strengths and delivers a compelling experience that is both accessible and deep. Its addictive gameplay loop, combined with its charming retro aesthetic, makes it a standout title in the indie roguelike scene.

In conclusion, ""Vampire Survivors"" is a bite-sized roguelike thrill that effortlessly balances simplicity with strategic depth. Whether you're a fan of the genre or a newcomer looking for an accessible entry point, this game is a must-play. Iced Lizard Games has crafted a delightful experience that proves you don't need flashy graphics or complex systems to create a captivating and endlessly enjoyable game.

HIGHLIGHT: A thrilling, immersive, hard to put down bullet-hell style rouge-like
DOWNSIDE: Say goodbye to your free-time.

If you're like me, you love a good ""one more run"" style game. Something that will have you red-eyed in the morning at your job. Your co-workers will invariably ask, ""Rough night?"" and because you're too embarrassed to say you've been on your Steam Deck until 2am and lost track of time playing a video game, you tell them you went out on a binger. 
(Sounds cooler anyway...)

Vampire Survivors has no hint of a story. I'm sure somewhere in there I missed the developers having thrown in some tacked on tale of an overrun castle, and monsters, etc. Truth is, I have been too busy repeatedly playing to even care.

From first boot, you might even hear yourself utter ""uh-oh"" like I did, because the front end does not properly tell the tale of the gameplay you're about to experience. After selecting the initial character (you can unlock more later) you get thrown right into the mix of the action. You're severely underpowered at first and I found myself thinking ""wait... my whip totally sucks"". That isn't just a reference to your mom's hand-me-down rusted out Corolla, your initial weapon will get you beat up faster than a 12 year old in his white belted karate gi on the 1st day of school, but that soon changes...

In minutes, all doubts go out the window and you realize you are in for one heck of a good time. 
The sheer amount of enemies on screen had me wondering if my Deck was going to get some lag going. Not a hint of that. Just onscreen madness. It's incredible fun, and if you've played this style of game before (of which there are quite a few) and are fond of the genre, you will likely find this to be the best of the bunch... it's that good.

You will be grinding that left analog stick into powder avoiding all manner of creatures and collecting as many blue gems as you can muster, looking for an often illusive ""floor chicken"" to boost your health, keeping you in game for just another few minutes.

I completely adore the not so subtle nods to Castelvania in both music and character design. The library specifically conjured up fond memories of the series and I am sure it had to be an inspiration.

This game is likely scribbled on many a seedy bathroom stall wall.

1) Low effort relaxation because it's an auto-shooter.
2) You mostly just move around to avoid damage, maximize damage dealt, and gather up ""xp"" dots dropped by monsters as quickly as possible.
3) After doing that for a while you try to pick the most optimal powerup to select next for the situation.
4) Lastly, you try to get ""unlocks"" for new characters and more power-ups by finding ""relics"" on the level or fulfilling achievements.
5) Even if you've effectively turned into god and everything that comes within half a screen radius of you now just dies instantly, the game will still kill you with an invincible monster at some point or keep upping the hp/defense of the mobs of monsters until they increasingly land blows on you.

After that, you spend the gold you got during that game on unlocks/powerups for future games.

Basically the ""unlocks"" is the main addictive reward mechanism in this.

If you're looking for some sort of coherent story, rational worldbuilding, or clever content or something go elsewhere because the game basically makes no sense at all. I can't tell if you're supposed to be vampires, or if you're supposed to be vampire hunters, or where you're supposed to be or what you're trying to accomplish other than ""unlocks"" in some generic insane world full of mobs of monsters. Basically questions like ""who, what, where,. when"" and especially ""why"" don't seem to have answers provided within the game.

But somehow it still seems to make more sense than Brotato.

So some advantages:
1) You're going to die anyway, so if you need to just walk away from the computer and let your character get killed then no big deal. Because of that it's a good thing to play to fill time when you may need to quit any moment.
2) It works well on the steam deck (and probably a bunch of other handhelds and mobiles) so you can do this while waiting in waiting rooms in public if you need.

Disadvantages:
1) Most levels have little to no level design. Some are just big open floors with some random obstacles. Some are more like hallways with walls on two sides of the screen, but overall the procedural generation is rather weak.
2) Ultimately there's not much to do but try to unlock everything. Unlike Hades, for example, there doesn't seem to be any final goal like ""kill dracula"", but maybe it's there and just not apparent to me yet.
3) Also unlike other games, it's not possible to ""win"" a level and move on to the next one. You always die, but a new level will be unlocked if you manage to fulfill some achievement before that happens.

Overall though this is good for when you need something that doesn't need to be taken seriously, and i've ended up playing it more than the other two most similar games I've bought recently (Brotato and Shape Shifter Formations).",1704453455,1704453657,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pick up a whip and smack them hard sideways. Or a magic wand that auto aims at the nearest monster with a projectile. Or play as the handsome shirtless man dual wielding his daggers and throwing them in whatever direction he's facing. Or just be an old man with really tight pants and a lot of garlic and stand there to weed out the weaker monsters, before taking a walk when the elites show up.

Or combine multiple weapons, upgrade them, and pick up accessories with passives to create a survivor that can survive for 15~30+ minutes before the end comes.

Explore your options across 190+ unlockables and counting, many of which add a new weapon, character, stage with its own obstacles, feature, or mechanic to change up how the game is played.

The soundtrack is amazing, the unlocks and ways you can build your character keep me coming back for another session and to clear the next unlock or sate some curiosity, and there are settings to make the game more difficult or getting more power to make the game easier.

There's also an Adventure Mode separate from the main game to get a more structured playthrough and some story to go with it.

I tell you this, when I started up this game, I did not ever expect to be scared, confused, feel blessed by the universe, or cry.  By the time of this review, all of those things happened in some form. 

DUDE! 

You're not listening to me. 

I. CRIED! 

Did I mention the soundtrack was amazing?

And while this game isn't for everyone, you may get bored getting too powerful and playing the same way intentionally without a curiosity to try something different, with no interest to adjust the difficulty settings or trying Adventure Mode to keep things fresher. 

The game has kept me pleasantly entertained and even after what appears to the last Steam achievement worth of unlocks, there are things that aren't achievements that I am still curious about and things that give me motivation to keep trying out thematic builds in different scenarios and even coming up with some head canon. I also turn on Endless Mode so that after 15~30 minutes, I can leave a mission on my own terms instead of seeing my little fellow get slain in one way or another.

e.g., a vampire hunter wielding a whip, axe, and daggers. A priest using a book without evolving it, holy water, and a cross. A witch with cats, a magic wand, fire wand, and other magic implements. Or a warrior that enjoys a good melee with his great sword and heavy armor. And intentionally limiting what weapons I pick up (limit break is available) so that it is a thematic build / playthrough instead of ""let me just grab every screen clearing weapon and maxing them out"".

So yes to recommend. Especially for that price.",1704391134,1704391134,True,1,0,0.50301206111907959,0,True,False,False

If you like fun little gratifying games, this is definitely for you and the second you open a chest with more than one item? brain goes brrrrrrt to hell. Its great!

Mild bullet hell but it does gradually increase into the hell part of bullet hell, but it IS possible to get to the 30 minute mark. Nothing more satisfying than getting close to that mark and basically becoming the most insanely defended tower in Balloon Tower Defense, Essentially, you are the tower and the tower said ""Forget this I have wheels now and I'm coming for you.""

Sound track slaps.

I'm also offering my hand to Krochi and Arca is goals (who DOESN'T wanna look like a stereotypical badass vampire hunter?)

Haven't tried out multiplayer yet, but my brother and I have been looking forward to it so, assuming my ADHD butt ain't forget, I'll update this when we try it out!

[EDIT]

So, still haven't tried multiplayer but I've heard from some friends that its good (brother and I had some family emergencies happen and haven't had much time to play together). BUT, I thought of another way to describe more or less what your goal when in early game and late-game kinda is:
> Early Game: Save as many Survivors as you can and find your favorite weapons and what synergizes well with them to you.

> Early / Mid Game:  Become the boss of a bullet hell game.

> Late Game:  Become functionally immortal and rattle them mobs for all their gold. You are now Midas without the debuff of making food and water gold and no kids to worry about accidentally murdering",1693149447,1704328134,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sure, it's probably inspired by a phone game that came before it (?), but nonetheless, I do believe it's the first of it's kind on Steam. That genre is one where you can move around and your weapons/skills are cast automatically.

This lead to a game where you can focus on running away from monsters and dodging attacks, while you automatically shoot back at enemies. It's a roguelike, so every games you start, you begin at level 1. At first you're weak, but through various level-up, upgrades, tarot cards and weapon evolutions, you get progressively stronger. The monsters do so as well, of course. Eventually, when you reach the end-game or grind enough, you can absolutely obliterate the whole game, which feels really rewarding.

At the same time, this brings on to the most negative point about this, sometimes it becomes an AFK-fest. If you care too much about how you build your character during a run, you become literally immortal. Some of the characters are so overpowered that you can literally AFK from level 1 as well, looting XP gems from time to time to level up and then go back to AFKing.

I would still highly recommend this game, which now cost $4.99 at full price and is an absolute bargain considering how much content it offers. Many levels, an awesome soundtrack, retro graphics, hundreds of unlocks and much more.

This game will take you to a world full of mysterious creatures and your job as a hunter is to kill them all. The concept of this game is very unique where you will use one character where that character will fight against hundreds or even thousands of creatures in the world of Vampire Survivors.

There is a lot of content provided in this game. Starting from the many characters that can be played, the map is large and endless, and the choice of weapons is very diverse. This makes gamers definitely want to try all the existing combinations and experiment using their own builds to complete each given stage.

The gameplay of this game is centered on the shoot 'em up genre, where you are tasked with killing all the monsters with your weapon. The choice of weapons provided is also very large. From melee and range weapons, to lasers that are ready to destroy all existing monsters. There are also a lot of characters provided. Each character also has its own stats and each stat also has advantages when combined with certain weapons. The map is also unique. There are many maps that you can try and each map has its own uniqueness. Additionally, each map has several unlockable characters, so the progress you make in the game will feel rewarding. Each map is limited to 30 minutes. After the time ends you will be killed by the Reaper. But don't worry, as time goes by, you can change the time limit using Endless mode. While in the game you have two objectives, one to defeat the enemy and two to collect crystals to upgrade your weapons. When the crystal touches a certain number, a random weapon will appear on your screen. Be careful because each weapon has its own use.

The weakness of this game is the weapon aspect. Each character can use all the weapons in the game. This means that characters who have weak stats will be easily replaced by overpowered characters. In my opinion, each character should have their spesific weapon that other characters cannot use. That way, the character has its own uniqueness. Another one is that if you have played this game often and know the movement patterns of each enemy, then this game will be very easy to complete. You'll often have to wait until the stage to end because your character is already overpower. IIt becomes a sometimes tedious waiting game. Another drawback, this game is not suitable for people with epilepsy. Repeatedly flashing lights and attacking sprites that shoot everywhere can make your eyes hurt and even make you nauseous.

The most important aspect of this game is its simple, fast-paced and chaotic gameplay. Great pixel art coupled with great game performance makes this game a lot of fun to enjoy. You will be addicted when you play it. Because it contains Rougelike elements, every time you die, you can restart each map, with a different character and with a different weapon. It's no wonder why many people spend hundreds of hours on this game.

In conclusion, this game is very suitable for casual or hardcore gamers to play. Simple and fast gameplay makes this game very suitable for anyone to enjoy. With specifications that are not too demanding and a very affordable price, this game is worth trying. But remember, this game will take up your time, a lot of your time. And don't forget, this game will get very easy as you progress and will feel a little boring once you've unlocked everything.",1697121866,1704304435,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

On a standalone review, this game has value for its buck. It is amusing and has different characters to keep you exploring new features or starts. At some point where you have unlocked everything it can become easy, but the developer thought of that with 2 optons. 1 is to unlock enemies becoming harder and the other is to reset the unlocking. Perfect. I can play the game however I like it and nothing stands in my way. You walk around trying different options untill you find the combinations that you like. Ever played they are billions? yeah dont seny you play it for those undead rushes coming for your base and you shooting them all. Well thats what this game is, just remove the tedious boring parts. And all the clicking.

But (and this maybe where the actual review starts) this game may be somewhat of a statement. I grew up with games that worked and are good, so I may be biased, I think this game is a statement to the A list game devolpers out there that you dont need graphics, you dont need in-game markets, you dont need to be pointed to where you need to go, you just need fun. The fact this game manages to do so in a very simple way - mind you, in a way that would be reprehensible in those days - is a lesson to be learned within the current gaming industry: stop focusing on micro transactions, graphics, trailers, hyping before lauch, and focus at least 90% of the budget on the journey of the gamer itself within that game? no? OK....good luck with that.

And I know, call of duty, madden, fifa, they all get away with releasing basically the same game every year. And if your moron friends outnumber the smart ones you have to buy those to keep playing multiplayer. I dont think this statement of a game will get you worried on that one. Oh here are some abandonware titles you might wanna check: conquest of the new world, imperialims 2, oh yeah civilization 2 vs the new ones (throne room seriously rocks), master of Orion 2, lands of lore thrones of chaos. ill just stop here.

Really loved the progression style, totally unique at least to me - no hand-holding, your curiosity leads you to seek out more content and easter eggs. Someone compared it to bubble wrap, very accurate.

Sadly though, the content does actually run out. Especially if this isn't your first time playing a rogue-like bullet hell adventure game. But it's actually priced right, unlike Slay The Spire.

I like that each match is pretty much maximum 30 min but I do dislike how you are locked into specific starter weapons on each character. Some weapons are just hella annoying/hard to start off with. Also takes quite a while to get going, much longer compared to other games in the genre.

There is some out-of-game progression with the gold you rake in at the end of every long match but even there, it's like a maxium of 10-15 hours before it's all maxed out. 

I am going to buy the DLCs and such but for a rogue-like it's not giving me the same scratch as something like Brotato or Hades.

I do not understand how I've gotten to this point. I bought this game and its DLC on a whim after seeing a streamer I liked play it, and didn't stop until I had collected every character, every item and did every challenge. At first it felt difficult to live for fifteen minutes, but it soon evolved into constant 30 minute affairs ended by Reapers. You know those rare runs in Binding of Isaac where you manage to get so overpowered, you can't see the screen for all the projectiles you shoot? That. That at all times plus infinity. 

The game is very good at making you feel strong and gives you a nice rewarding feeling with each unlock. Plus it's so simple it makes it a perfect podcast or audio book game. I love all the weapons, the Amongus gear always puts a smile on my face because of how ingeniously it was put in. Character sprites are also a treat, there are a lot of good looking enemies too. The DLC maps are fun to wander around in, being actual levels rather then endless plains of fields or bones.

The downsides are few but are there, I've never fallen asleep playing a game before and it happened twice to me here. Because there is less interactivity than a DvD menu, if I didn't have something in the background to engage with I'd drift to sleep. The only other thing is once you hit that point where you can consistently turn every run into an enemies die on spawn and you don't need to move even on inverse mode, it gets very dull. Though this is by choice, you have lots of characters, weapons and items to choose so it's on you for how easy or hard you make it. Regardless you'll still be either spinning in circles, walking forward or stationary. Not very engaging once you've found everything including secrets.

- Pretty simple pixel art. Honestly, when I first bought the game, I thought it looked pretty bad, but it's grown on me over time
- The sound effects, however, are awesome. It's like the dev had a folder of audio files called ""dopamine triggers"" and used them throughout the game
- The soundtrack is another high point. I love that music is selectable at the outset of a run, too

[b]Story & Vibes[/b]
- Vampire Survivors is unique in its approach to a narrative: there isn't one, but it really seems like there should be one hidden there somewhere. All the pieces are in place--there are interesting looking characters, lore entries in the form of collections, settings and locations in levels, etc--but they don't really add up to a plot or story
- It follows that the vibes are a little hard to figure. All the vaguely fantasy set dressing and absence of a narrative makes you feel more like you're playing with a toy than playing a video game

[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]
- Here it is: the birth of a new subgenre. There are plenty of imitators, but this gameplay loop is the original. You walk around on an infinitely scrolling surface while autofiring your weapons at waves of enemies that fill the screen. You collect items and upgrades for your equipment that help you cope with the growing forces of bad guys
- Eventually, the timer hits the limit specified in level select screen, Death comes out to claim you, and the run ends (...usually)
- Vampire Survivors is packed with secrets, unlockables, and secret unlockables. You'll spend plenty of time looking through the collection and unlock menus to try and figure out how to get everything
- Despite the lack of engagement offered by a gameplay loop like this one, it's highly addicting. It's like rewards and progress are spaced out at optimal intervals to keep you coming back for your next hit. That said, after nearly 40 hours, I feel like I need a break for a bit before coming back to try Adventure Mode and the DLC stuff

[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]
- It always feels weird putting together a review for a game that's become a cultural phenomenon like Vampire Survivors. The word is out already: it's a fun game with broad appeal and a casual learning curve
- I'm just so impressed with how addictive this game is. Poncle has a grasp of dopamine and reward timing that would put a neuroscientist to shame

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
- [b]8/10[/b]. The market for so-called ""bullet heavens"" is saturated now, but you'd be doing yourself a service not to try the original. Pick it up and see what the fuss is about",1704122779,1704122779,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

What irks me the most is the blatant lack of originality, with each new game in this tired genre merely rehashing the same tired formula. In an attempt to provide an unbiased review, I'll compare it to established video game standards, exposing its inability to measure up without resorting to copying other games.

Much like a poor imitation of Minecraft, this game clumsily throws players into mundane environments, forcing them to engage in uninspired combat against unimaginative enemies, all while mindlessly collecting orbs for generic experience points. The so-called leveling system presents players with a limited array of dull choices between uninteresting active and passive skills, resulting in a forgettable and unimpressive character build. Succumbing to the mind-numbingly predictable hordes only leads to a swift descent into mediocrity, akin to being devoured by a forgettable and lackluster creature.

One facet that attempts to salvage the game's dismal appeal is a feeble attempt at humor, which falls flat and fails to inject any genuine enjoyment into the overall experience.

On a scale of 1/10: not worth the purchase, even if it came with garlic as a desperate attempt to add some flavor.",1678875281,1704122167,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

the game often introduces new mechanics every now and then and has loads of secrets that you likely wouldn't find without the wiki

I originally got this game due to it's low price and because it looked like a fun game to keep my hands busy and turn my brain off while I watched videos. Turns out this game was extremely addicting and fun due to the nature of it's game play. The pixel art-style isn't anything extraordinary but rather the highlight of this game is it's game play. The game play is quite simple but as you progress you unlock new weapons, passive items, characters, maps, and discover secrets.

The main game play loop doesn't require that much thinking as you try to level your character and weapons without dying to the monsters that spawn endlessly every wave but it's enjoyable as you play different characters on different maps and try different combinations of weapons. The only times I found myself really critically thinking while playing this game was trying to figure out some of the secrets, but there isn't anything super challenging that I couldn't figure out eventually, making it enjoyable to complete everything in this game and discover all there is to it.

As for the end game there isn't really one, there is not content in the game that is extremely difficult that very few players have been able to complete, the only (sort of) end game that exists is over levelling your character via golden eggs. I personally dislike this form of an end game as I don't exactly see the reason for it and at some point due to the random nature of the golden eggs you end up getting too much speed on your character where that character is almost unplayable with golden eggs enabled.

My final thoughts on Vampire Survivors is that I personally recommend this game as I enjoyed it a lot and for the price you pay for the content you get it's very worth it. As for the additional content in the DLCs, I don't think they're a must buy to enjoy the game as just the base game has hours of enjoyable content to discover but for the players who want to discover everything there is to the game or those dying for more Vampire Survivors content then you might consider buying the DLCs.

It can be cool finding the best combinations of certain things to do the most damage. 

Certain parts of the game that may seem ""buggy"" are actually quite endearing. If your movement speed is high enough you can actually clip through walls occasionally which allows for some fun transitioning through the maps. The maps feel well thought out, the weapons and passives all feel strong and powerful in their own ways, the win conditions for the game is varying and cool. Late game mechanics like golden eggs allow for some amazingly broken builds.

To be honest, I can think of absolutely nothing negative to say about the game. It would be easily worth 20€, which in my region would be four times the current asking price. The last time I had this much fun for this little money (relatively) was probably with Terraria (which was/is astonishingly cheap and the developers regretted it, but still supply massive free updates to this day) or with Europa Universalis 4 (which has an extremely, [i][b]extremely[/b][/i] high replay value and the developers are moving heaven and earth to monetise it, so far only managing to lessen the replay value).",1703810277,1703810490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It may have the graphics of a 1980s Commodore 64 or an OG Nintendo game but it has the depth of a much bigger RPG.

If you want a compulsively addictive main game its also for you.  When you start the game you have only 2 or 3 Survivors unlocked: you get the rest by completing tasks in the game.  The weapons pool is a bit spartan too: you find extra weapons and modifications around the maps: once you've found them you can use them in subsequent games too.  It will take a few hours of grinding to unlock all of the enhancements by earning gold coins in the game and then using them in the lobby to improve your abilities.  You'll be dying a lot when you first start as your characters only have their base abilities but stick with it: it gets easier.  There's no tutorial, you're just straight in there, the weapons fire automatically by the way: you just need to use the movement keys.  There's a lot of content and about 150 initial challenges to complete (which allow further unlocks), plus a recent Adventures mode which I've hardly played but looks to be a campaign-style mode plus three very cheap DLCs.

Highly recommend the game on mobile (iOS/Android)

Here's the reasons why:

2. DLC Is cheaper
3. WAY easier, since the randomisation is not as brutal
4. ALOT more features

In all seriousness, this game.... there's a reason why it's one of the highest rated games ever. It's fantabulous in every way. You can play it anywhere on about anything and it's a price anyone can afford. 

I struggle hard with anxiety most days and at first this game overwhelmed me to the core and it sat in the library for a few months. I laugh about it now because I get it and it's quickly moved into a cozy little favorite.   Hell, just last night I was playing on my main PC, finished a few rounds and tried to sleep. Nope. Ended up turning on my ROG Ally and played for 3 more hours. Ooops

So if you've always been on the fence about this gem, you should just probably get it already. Music's pretty bitchin' too

The game's mechanics are both simple to grasp and incredibly deep, allowing for a satisfying learning curve that keeps you coming back for more. The variety of characters and their distinct abilities add an extra layer of strategy, making each playthrough a fresh and exciting adventure.

Visually, the pixel art style of Vampire Survivors is charming and nostalgic, reminiscent of classic arcade games. The game's soundtrack complements the intense action perfectly, immersing you in its dark and mysterious world.

What truly sets Vampire Survivors apart is its replayability. Each run feels like a new experience, and the randomized elements keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. The game's community and developer support also contribute to its longevity, with regular updates and new content that ensure there's always something new to discover.

In conclusion, Vampire Survivors is not just a game; it's an exhilarating journey into the heart of challenging gameplay and strategic depth.

Don't take it from me, though.  We've got a guest appearance from one of the stars of the game, so without further ado, I present an Interview with the Vampire.

[i]Otter: Thank you for taking the time to be with us today. I'll get things started, since we have a lot of ground to cover.[/i]

Vampire: As long as it's not hallowed ground.  Mwa haha. I kid, but it's great to be here.

[i]O: The player is up against a wide variety of enemies, and in large numbers.  How did you coordinate such a cast?[/i]

V: Well, we really wanted to focus on the diversity in the evil creature community, and celebrate the different ways we have to maul, mutilate, defile, and desecrate the player, so we went all out.  From evil bats, to mummies, zombies and witches, mean trees, very evil bats, cryptic eyes, you name it, we got it.

[i]O: Impressive.  Although I couldn't help but notice they all employ a similar strategy.[/i]

V: There is that, true.  There wasn't time to do much rehearsal, so we just kind of went with ""Everyone move directly toward the player at all times"".

[i]O: Understandable.  Still, it is a bit unfortunate, since a player with evolved garlic and lightning can just stand there, and the enemies sort of...[/i]

V: They all die.  Yes, we're working on that, and to be sure, there is a way to go, but we do have an eternity to work with, so I'm sure things will improve.

[i]O: Well, I do wish you luck in the future.  Thank you for your time.[/i]

V: Glad to do it, and I would like to say to any players reading this.  Just, take it easy on the garlic, will ya?

2. lack of player agency in combat. This is the big one and the main reason I quit and got a refund. I cannot control the attacks at all. They're all automatic. I don't want to play a combat game where I only control movement. If I can't control when and how I attack, I have no interest in playing.

🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it
🔲 Easy
✅ Normal
🔲 Hard
🔲 Dark Souls

Relatively easy, major focus on meta progression, when you can get gold on a good level then you've basically won the game

~ GRAPHICS ~

🔲 MS Paint
🔲 Bad
🔲 Meh
🔲 Graphics don't matter in this
✅ Good
🔲 Beautiful
🔲 Masterpiece

Has a distinct art-style that matches the old Castlevania games, which this game is mostly taking inspiration from.

~ MUSIC ~

🔲 Really Bad
🔲 Bad
🔲 Not special
✅ Good
🔲 Beautiful
🔲 Add to my playlist

Pretty good music, still taking inspiration from Castlevania, overall really good.

~ STORY ~

✅ This game has no story
🔲 Some bits of story
🔲 Story is there but doesn't leave any impact
🔲 Well written
🔲 Epic story
🔲 Top tier story writing

In my time of playing this game, I haven't really come across any major story plot. Mainly a game for the satisfaction of large enemies being devastated.

~ PRICE ~

🔲 It's free

✅Under-priced
🔲 Perfect Price
🔲 Could be cheaper
🔲 Overpriced
🔲 Complete waste of money

Game is incredibly cheap for the amount of time you can play this game for.

~ REQUIREMENTS ~

🔲 You can run it on a microwave/toaster
✅ School computer
🔲 Average
🔲 High end
🔲 NASA computer

I can run this on a cheap laptop, however, it can get pretty hot and slow down a tiny bit because of all the calculations needed, so it can run on a cheap laptop, but recommended to be a bit better

~ LENGTH ~

(Full Achievements)

🔲 Extremely Short (60 minutes or less)
🔲 Very Short (1 - 3 hours)
🔲 Short (3 - 15 hours)
🔲 Average (15-50 hours)
✅ Long (50-90 hours)
🔲 Extremely long (90-110 hours)
🔲 Long Long Man (110+ hours)

I only review games I platinum, so this is dedicated to how long it took me to get all achievements

~ FUN ~

🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry
🔲 Hard to enjoy
✅ Turn off brain and relax
🔲 Actually pretty amusing
🔲 I wish I could wipe my memory and play this again

Game is fun to just sit down, relax, and play something simple for 30 minutes or longer, no complex thinking needed, no story that needs to be focused on, just turn off your brain and relax

~ REPLAYABILITY~

🔲 One and done
🔲 Multiple Endings
✅ Fun to replay over and over
🔲 Infinitely replayable/Active Modding community

Fun to replay over and over due to the roguelike gameplay, don't know if there is a modding community but the base game already offers a lot of replayability

~ WORTH BUYING ~

🔲 Remove this from the steam store
🔲 No
🔲 Wait for sale
✅ Yes
🔲 You NEED to experience this game

8/10, not a high high priority game, but if you want to just relax for hours then this is the game for you",1703530274,1703530274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is even MORE valuable that that box of snack cakes you would have bought with those three dollars.
More maps, more characters, more weapons, more MUSIC.
Hot damn, the music is fantastic, with an all new soundtrack that you can switch up during matches.

Lots of stuff has been added to the base game. No DLC required to access a lot of stuff this game has.

The gameplay gets faster and more difficult the more you progress and after a while, you can make choices to determine how hard the game gets.

There are combinations in this game that you can use to wreck the game itself. It doesn't matter how beefy your pc is, it doesn't matter if you have the CPU Lag Fix enabled. If you know what you're doing, you can become a godslayer and bring the engine to a near halt with the amount of death, destruction, and particle effects you can cause.

Play this.

(ORIGINAL REVIEW)
Will give you more enjoyment than the box of Little Debbie snack cakes you were thinking about buying with that $3.
Currently under Early Access, this game continues to get regular updates, adding new characters, items, and areas with their own fantastic music.
Vampire Survivors may be a cheap game, but it isn't cheap on vision.
It plays like an arcade game in a similar vain to Smash TV, dropping your totally not Castlevania character onto a map with a top-down view, putting a weapon in your hands, and you just start swinging/shooting/blasting.
Direct your 16-bit avatar in the way of one of the many monstrous denizens and gather jewels to level up and become stronger.
It may start slow and difficult, but keep gathering coins for permanent upgrades and new characters and soon you could become a boss yourself.

Well here we are... This Game is insanely fun!

Despite a lot of RNG to the item drops, you can always outline some builds and follow them more or less, in most runs. There's also so many unlocks to discover in the different stages, you wouldn't believe it at first considering they seem to just endlessly loop.

Also, you'll think ""just one more run"" quite regularly once you get a little deeper into the game.
Endless chaos, mayhem and loot await. Give it a try, that price is a steal!
Easily 12/10 from me.

Edit 110ish hours later: They keep adding new fun stuff, it's awesome! By the time you've unlocked half the available stuff, you become bullet hell!
It even runs very well on the trash PC at work. You really only need any input device hooked up to a potato. Nice!

Edit: another 200+ hours later: Goddamn man! The DLCs (3 at the moment) add a ton of great characters and weapons, a bunch of awesome maps, and the Adventures are pretty fun as well. You'll unlock so many tools to tweak runs as you want them to go, difficulty will more or less be up to your tastes. Gimp yourself in one way or another, boost the enemies, disable items from the RNG pool and make that aspect more bearable.

I waited those 8 more minutes more or less just standing in one area, occasionally moving to collect gems, and doing nothing else. Subsequent runs have had me in the same situation again and again. I get that this is a cheap game made by one guy, but I would not recommend this at any price point. It's a roguelike with no real skill expression, it loses steam once you get a few upgrades, the gameplay is repetitive, and it really struggles to be engaging for the last 30% of each level.

Just buy it. Eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or two instead of eating out for one meal, and you'll be able to with all the DLC. Its under $10 USD even when not on sale.

Vampire Survivors is a reverse bullet hell (a bullet heaven?) rogue-lite where *YOU* are the bullet hell and a swarm of enemies comes after you. Every run is just walking around to pick up stuff and dodge enemies/aim your weapons at the enemies, and making decisions on items/upgrades. It's very addicting (do NOT start playing if you have anything to do tomorrow/any important project deadlines coming) despite its simplistic gameplay. Make builds, unlock a bunch of stuff, and have fun.

Value-wise, it's THREE DOLLARS, so little to no regrets will be had, plus the amount of content alone for the price is insane.

The game revolves around vampires, a concept rich with possibilities for diverse characters and storylines. Unfortunately, the developers missed a golden opportunity to embrace inclusivity. The character choices feel limited and stereotypical, and it's disheartening to see such a one-dimensional representation in a game that could have explored a broader range of identities.

In a gaming industry that is gradually recognizing the importance of diverse narratives, Vampire Survivors feels like a step backward.

For the price, even if purchasing the full game and all of the DLC, it really is a bargain. While it takes a bit to learn early what is going on, it's worth playing. Once mastered, it's what brings one to be able to make runs with little effort and kick back with it.

It is not that it takes long to play or finish, I've completed each DLC's full content in around 30 minutes or less. It is not that the graphics are great. Although, they are solid and show little to no issues regardless of the system. The music is good though I tend to turn it down or off after a bit because it becomes repetitive. The fact that it's spawned a different genre and many clones is a testament to the Devs and what they've managed to achieve. Added to the point of price and how low the cost is overall, I recommend this game to anyone looking at the genre.

I will say that of all the content that's come out after release, the one thing that I've not enjoyed was the ""story mode."" I was hoping for some in-depth context of the origins and reasons for the runs. Something akin to say Children of Morta. Maybe I'm just missing it, but a paragraph at the beginning of each run with what is essentially playing through the whole game again is a little bit of a letdown.

This review is based off base game AND all DLC content.(To date)
[Among-Us DLC is amazing!]

This game is the best game I have ever played. 

The main reason i consider it the best is because of the perfect rate of progression. 
Your not thrown into an intimidating mess of abilities, characters and maps. 
The game slowly introduces you to each mechanic one run at a time. It makes for way more exciting game play. 

It also lets you take charge of what you would like to unlock next with only the spoiler of the item picture to guess what it does or a character silhouette. 

The player is not locked into choosing specific characters and items. They all have benefits making them all super fun to play.

Vampire survivors has an amazing way it approaches maps. When you first play it your under the illusion that its just a simple map but you'd be fooled to think its only that Adventuring through the maps and revealing secrets is another one of the great game designs.

Not to mention.. its split screen which is amazing with friends!

I did have a few negative thoughts on the game but they really did not take away from the experience.

Cons;
A small handful of characters felt kind of bad due to the amount of similarity between others.(3 only)

Secrets codes. While I get the codes are handy a prompt would have been nice to warn that by using the code the player would not be able to do the challenge.

With nearly 20 hours of immersive gameplay under my belt, I stand here in awe of the epic journey that awaits any intrepid adventurer who dares to traverse its sinister landscapes. Allow me to share my experience, which has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on my gaming soul.

From the moment I stepped foot into Diablo 4, I was greeted by a breathtaking world meticulously crafted by the visionary minds at Blizzard Entertainment. The attention to detail is second to none, with hauntingly beautiful environments that simultaneously evoke a sense of dread and wonder. Every corner of this world pulsates with life, and the atmospheric graphics draw you in, making it impossible to escape its grasp.

The gameplay mechanics of Diablo 4 are nothing short of addictive. The combat is an exhilarating dance of destruction, whether I was unleashing devastating spells or wielding mighty weapons. The fluidity and responsiveness of the controls heightened my sense of empowerment, enabling me to effortlessly dispatch hordes of foes in a symphony of chaos.

But Diablo 4 is not merely about mindless hack-and-slash action. The intricate web of lore and storytelling weaves its magic throughout the game. Engrossing quests and captivating dialogue breathe life into the rich tapestry of Diablo's universe, introducing memorable characters and gripping narrative arcs that kept me invested and hungry for more.

The character progression system in Diablo 4 is a testament to its depth and replayability. As I honed my skills and unlocked new abilities, I felt a genuine sense of growth and evolution. The freedom to customize my character's playstyle and experiment with various builds added an additional layer of excitement, ensuring that no two playthroughs would ever be the same.

It would be remiss of me not to mention the cooperative multiplayer aspect of Diablo 4, which amplifies the experience to staggering heights. Joining forces with fellow adventurers, battling formidable bosses together, and sharing in the spoils of our conquests created a sense of camaraderie that is truly unparalleled.

In terms of longevity, Diablo 4 offers an expansive endgame that guarantees countless hours of enjoyment. From the challenging dungeons and raids to the endless pursuit of powerful loot, the game continually entices you to push your limits and prove your mettle. With future updates and expansions promised by the developers, the Diablo 4 experience promises to be an enduring odyssey.

In conclusion, Diablo 4 is an absolute masterpiece that has captivated my gaming heart. Its awe-inspiring visuals, addictive gameplay, immersive storytelling, and robust multiplayer elements combine to create a gaming experience that is nothing short of legendary. If you seek an adventure that will leave you spellbound and craving for more, Diablo 4 is an absolute must-have.

But after watching a few more runs I began to understand... 

This game has a very large pool of items , characters, maps, gameplay modifiers and secrets to unlock and play with. Like any good roguelike it allows you to mix and match combinations to make each run unique. I was impressed by the amount of content you get for only £7.17 (including DLCs). Every handful of runs I would unlock a new gameplay element that allows me to change the game even more. This game feeds that itch that is scratched by games like Risk of Rain 2 and has that same ""just one more run"" feeling to it. I have on more than one occasion sat down to play a single run and ended up playing 4 or more...  And even after getting all of the achievements and playing for 60 hours I still feel like I have not seen all the content this game has to offer. I know i haven't unlocked all the characters yet.

TL;DR : 
[list]
[*] basic gameplay
[*] fast, chaotic and fun
[*] lots of content
[*] good price
[*] much replay-ability
[*] fun, non-grindy achievements
[*] great on Steam Deck (might make u lag :) )
[*] VERY addictive
[*] no vampires (yet?)

Regardless, this is an absolutely fantastic game and very deserving of its Overwhelmingly Positive (currently 98% for both recent and all reviews) rating. Getting through the ""base"" level of content would probably only take you 7-10 hours, but there is so much hidden away that you can discover and explore. I've not even made it through unlocking all the secrets on the secret menu (despite using guides to do so... yes, I'm that type of gamer lol) and I'm over 50 hours in. The gameplay is extremely satisfying, the aesthetics are dope, and unlocking new characters and secrets is a never-ending drive that I love (and that doesn't feel too frustrating beyond my difficulties finding the damn cheese... don't ask). 

Oh, and did I mention the base game is only $5? And the DLCs are only $2?! (Besides the Among Us DLC, but that is literally... $0.50 more. Oh no, my bank account, it's broken by this MASSIVE cost. /s) Point is, this game is incredibly cheap, considering the huge value you can get out of it. 10/10, would recommend the base game and DLCs (I have not yet tried the Among Us one, but the other two absolutely add a ton of value to this already high-value game).",1703010758,1703010758,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The first complaint I have is that there is no aiming in this game. Your directional attacks are based on your characters current direction and you cannot strafe or fire in a direction you are not facing.

[strike]The second complaint that I have is that without mods (more on this later) there are many limitations that make very little sense, such as being limited to one Golden Egg per stage, which means you will have to quit the stage after obtaining the 1 from the shop and the 4 from killing a few specific superbosses from the end game that spawn when you collect a certain item (one item for each boss) which means grinding stats takes [b]ages[/b] to increase your permanent stats of your favorite characters, even if you have huge stacks of coins laying around after buying everything you can (though I'm not quite there yet, but I've had 50k plus and found it annoying that I have to run 5 stages to buy 5 golden eggs, so I can definitely understand the pain of someone who has a million or more sitting in their coffers being forced to run one stage for one golden egg when they can afford hundreds of them)[/strike] EDIT: This has been changed! No longer an issue!

And my last complaint is related to the secrets in the game. Not a 'real' complaint, just me whining about how much I have struggled in figuring things out because I'm too stubborn to go online for a guide.

All that in mind... This game is $5. Watch the trailer and see if it looks like something you hate. If it looks like you won't hate it then stop thinking and buy it. 

Satisfying progression, interesting mechanics, hilarious secrets, and a killer soundtrack that apparently no one else is talking about. This game is worth $20, but you'll pay at most a fraction of that, so just buy it.

And if you're as stingy as me with your wallet... then go play Holocure for a few minutes to get a feel for the gameplay there, and then come back to play the superior game of that style... at least until the next round of Hololive characters are added.

If you couldn't tell from the previous bit, I got this game as a means of killing time to wait until the next update for the unmoddable Holocure... and I ended up liking this game a helluva lot more. I would really appreciate a strafe feature, but besides that... Vampire Survivors is the superior game in almost every possible way. Though I will say that Holocure will still have my heart because Korone is best doggo... unless someone makes a Korone mod for Vampire Survivors.

‘It’ is particularly hard to define. It’s the point where all your weapons and items blend seamlessly into a rainbow of death. It’s the moment you watch every enemy enjoy a lifespan of half a second, before they’re wiped off the face off the earth by a torrent of special effects. Yet as much as I could continue to list examples, none of these will actually be able to capture the sheer [i]euphoria[/i] of the thing – of beating the numbers game, of literally sitting back and enjoying the carnage, of…

Well, perhaps we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Firstly, it’s worth taking a step back to digest what Vampire Survivors is actually all about. As it turns out, however, only a brief step is needed; you pick a static character sprite - each with their own unique weapon - and move around the screen to both dodge foes and destroy them with said weapon. Kill enough, and you level up, allowing you to add new gear to your arsenal or power up your existing stuff. That’s it. That’s the entire thing. This is game design stripped down to the barest essentials – your movement keys, and an occasional tap of the space-bar to confirm a menu of two. That's everything you need.

[h1]Embrace the chaos[/h1]

Yet, as classics of design such as Pac-man and Tetris will tell you, you don’t need anything intricate to create a compelling experience. The joy in Vampire Survivors is mastering those key gameplay elements. It’s all about deftly weaving your way through the small gaps left in the frankly ludicrous amount of enemies to grab those precious experience points in the brief moments you can. Then it’s about learning what each weapon and skill does, and – crucially – how they synergise with each other. Simple throwing knives not enough? Pair them up with the bracer, and watch those singular knives become an endless torrent that would leave even the most powerful machine gun jealous. 

This builds and builds, until you reach that point of ‘it’ – where it all clicks together, and it just feels so good. Your attacks can end up swarming the screen, and it’s entirely feasible to create runs that require no input from you that still end in victory. I’ve seen the tagline “Be the bullet hell” be used by the developers, and I think that’s very apt to explain what’s going on here; this is a game leaning into the idea of glorious excess so hard the concept practically starts to strain against itself. Even the sheer act of opening an item chest is overblown; hitting a jackpot on these starts with a shower of fireworks, ramps the music up to 11, and then sees more rewards swing in from the side of the screen as your reward plays out. It’s like the developers have tapped directly into the pleasure centres of the brain, and are determined to feed it with as much serotonin as possible. 

This extends beyond what occurs in as singular run of a level, as well. Each success sees you unlock more and more features. There are extra weapons, which naturally add variety (and insanity) to your play. There are extra levels and gameplay modes, which modify things in ways such as speeding things up or just making the entire experience infinitely harder. And there’s such a vast amount of them, as well; after over 15 hours I’ve only just opened up what essentially feels like a campaign mode, which is so in-depth it has its own section dedicated to it on the menu screen.

[h1]Lost in translation[/h1]

One of my complaints, however, is that the sheer amount of content in the game isn’t that well reflected and presented through said menus. Beyond a brief explanation when you first unlock a new feature, there’s little guidance on what everything does, which can be overwhelming, and not in a good way. Some descriptions or explanations when highlighting stuff, or even general tool tips, wouldn’t go too far amiss. If anything, they feel like a strange omission.  

My other complaint is that, despite all attempts and intentions to spice things up, the core gameplay does essentially boil down to doing the same thing over and over again. Survive the initial onslaught, become a nigh-on indestructible demon, rinse and repeat.  Realistically I accept this isn’t really a slight against the game’s minimalist design, which honestly is one of its greatest strengths. It’s perhaps more a recognition that this isn’t the sort of title where you’re going to want to settle yourself down and play it for hours on end. It’s definitely best played in short bursts, when the need for an endorphin hit strikes you. The words ‘Steam Deck’ come to mind – as does the word ‘Switch’, come to think of it, but I’m not sure if that’s a dirty word to say around here. 

Still, these are trifling concerns in the grand scheme of things. Vampire Survivors is offering so much at a price that is so very little – at the time of writing, what amounts to essentially a generic brand cup of coffee. To split hairs over some minor concerns seems necessary and, indeed, perhaps missing the entire point as to what is on offer here. You should get this and really find out what ‘it’ is for yourself. You won’t regret it. 
(Oh, and I’ve still not survived any actual vampires, mind you. Not sure what’s up with that.)

Vampire Survivors, minimalist rogue-lite tarzı ile son zamanlarda oldukça popüler hale gelen bir hayatta kalma oyunu. Şimdi size oyunu detaylı bir şekilde anlatıp inceleyelim:

Oyunun Amacı:

    Cehennem ateşinde hayatta kalma mücadelesi veriyorsunuz.
    Binlerce vampir, hayalet ve diğer yaratığı avlayarak şafağa kadar dayanmanız gerekiyor.
    Her gece hayatta kalarak altın biriktirip, bir sonraki denemede yeni beceriler, silahlar ve karakterler açarak kendinizi güçlendiriyorsunuz.

Oynanış Mekaniği:

    Oyun oldukça basit bir oynanışa sahip. Hareketinizi kontrol ediyorsunuz, silahlarınız ise otomatik olarak ateş ediyor.
    Yönünü değiştirerek ve stratejik hareketler yaparak gelen düşman dalgalarından kaçıyor ve onları avlıyorsunuz.
    Silah seçimi ve güçlendirmeler çok önemli. Doğru kombinasyonları seçerek hayatta kalma şansınızı yükseltiyorsunuz.
    Her gece harita değişiyor, size yeni stratejiler deneme imkanı veriyor.

Oyunun Olumlu Yönleri:

    Basit ama bağımlılık yapan oynanış: Kolay öğrenilen ancak ustalaşması zor bir oynanış sunuyor.
    Rogue-lite unsurları: Her denemede farklı bir deneyim yaşamanızı sağlıyor, tekrar oynanabilirliği yüksek.
    Yüksek hızlı aksiyon: Sürekli hareket halinde olmanız gereken tempolu bir oynanışa sahip.
    Minimalist grafikler ve müzik: Eski klasik arcade oyunlarını hatırlatan bir tarzı var, nostaljik hissettiriyor.
    Uygun fiyat: Oyun oldukça uygun bir fiyata sahip, fiyat/performans açısından başarılı.

Oyunun Olumsuz Yönleri:

    Basitlik zamanla tekrarlayıcı hale gelebilir: Uzun süreli oynanışlarda aynı aksiyonun devam etmesi bazı oyuncuları sıkabilir.
    Hikaye ve karakter eksikliği: Oyun hikaye veya karakter gelişimi sunmuyor, sadece hayatta kalmaya odaklanıyor.
    Optimizasyon sorunları: Bazı platformlarda performans sorunları yaşanabiliyor.

Sonuç Olarak:

Vampire Survivors, oynanışı kolay ancak ustalaşması zor, bağımlılık yapan bir hayatta kalma oyunu. Basit grafikleri ve yüksek hızlı aksiyonu ile sizi cehennemin derinliklerine sürüklüyor. Oyunun rogue-lite unsurları sayesinde her denemede farklı bir deneyim yaşamanızı sağlıyor.  Eğer basit ama eğlenceli bir oyun arıyorsanız, Vampire Survivors tam size göre. Ancak derin hikaye veya karakter gelişimi beklemiyorsanız hayal kırıklığı yaşayabilirsiniz.

I did NOT expect to get so addicted to the game that I'd spend nearly 24 hours on it in the first 4 days of me purchasing it. Like this is probably a very polarizing game i'll be honest, you likely love it or hate it with no in-between, but just hear me out: Go watch AliensRock or someone on youtube play a few runs of this game, and if you think for even a moment ""hey this seems fun"", BUY IT. Even if it's not for you, you've helped some cool devs out. Hell, buy it just for the soundtrack (which bangs). Steam remote play is kinda janky but works like a dream with this game, and playing this with my friend for the first time tonight was great. There's progression, there's unlocks tied to Steam achievements, there's an adventure mode with a sort of plot? Among Us DLC in like 2 days??? Speaking of silly content, this game wears clear inspiration on its sleeve with many silly little tongue-in-cheek jokes hidden all over the place (the music for the church level quotes Bach's Toccata and Fugue and when I heard it for the first time I had to pause to laugh for like 5 minutes bc it was just in-and-out before going back to being its own thing).

I started playing the game in my phone out of curiosity and dang I was hooked up. I only stopped because it was destroying my neck and eyes to play on a small screen so I had to get it here.

Despite being super simple when it comes to gameplay (You just walked around, auto-shoots, and choose upgrades), it's super gratifying and fun and the amount of content and unlocks will keep you entertained for a long time.

It's funny because it feels like it has like all the marks of a game that could have been incredibly predatory and full of microtransactions but they made all these addictive features, design and choices and then just made it a super cheap game with no bullshit. It's perfect.

It's the best game to get a dopamine injection right into your brain, either for a quick session or for a couple of hours because the game is also one of those that make you go ""Just one more round"". Music is banger, graphics are charming, and it's full of little things that give it depth and fun. Specially considering the price it's hard to not recommend it and it's gonna appeal to casual gamers to a more ""hardcore"" audience if you want. The amount of positive reviews are well deserved.

The closest thing I would it plays like is Binding of Isaac. 
But only one endless room and endless enemies.
Your main objective is to find good weapon sets and evolutions and make it to 30 minutes.
At the time of review I have 176 hours and 87 achievements.
Well worth the money and a great chill game.
UPDATE: Coming up on 500 hours, this guy does not stop. The game has become a monster. Mad props to the dev. Constant updates, with new weapons, passsives, upgrades, enemies, relics, characters, secrets and arcanas. It is my go to Chill play game now and I have made a few leaderboard runs. And the dude is not done yet. I have a feeling I will gets another few hundred hours out of this game. Currently %100 achievements and missing 1 secret but I know what to do, just haven't done it yet.
UPDATE: Vampire Survivors actually got so big it is spawning clones and kinda of making its own genre. You can say Slay the Spire but VP I think had a much better feel and the most of them are straight up VP with a skin. You cant really say it's classic so fast, but I would say it started a wave of games of his this type. Currently at 542 hrs. Think I will get 1000 for sure.  
UPDATE: 1.0 is almost out, it is now a huge and pretty well polished game. So many cool little things now like bestiary, and a random button, And the audio has made a huge jump. I'm so happy I caught on early. 
Completed everything and still make runs. Its one of the best chill game ever.
UPDATE: 700 hours, 100%, and I am still playing. Making new builds, doing challenge runs. 
I switched my Binding of Isaac addiction for a Vampire Survivor addiction.
At least do a few runs a day. One of the best games of all time. Thank you so much Luca.

how people can think this is good is beyond me. this game does a terrible job of conveying information (just look at the maps) for no good reason but there are people simping it because they're dumb. a map that doesn't convey where things are is bad. that's it, that's truly all there is to it.

But that’s exactly what you have here. There’s a reason it was nominated for a bunch of awards when it was released in 2022. I still kind of wonder if that “reason” is some kind of charm spell hidden in the game’s files…

I don’t mean that in any derogatory way, of course. I’ve played this game for hours and loved every second of it. (It was the first game I sank any meaningful amount off time into on my Steam Deck, for god’s sake.) It’s just that this is, on its face, a very simple game. Most of the player input, outside of menu navigation, is moving your character. Attacking and spell casting are both done automatically – the player only needs to position the character among the throngs of enemies for optimal obliteration. To me, when the enemies are coming at you in full force, it ends up feeling like I’m navigating a moving maze as I try squeezing through gaps in the enemy front. That is, until you get swallowed by the mob or Death himself comes for you and the level ends.

And that’s kind of it. Don’t be fooled, though – the gameplay loop is addictive as fuck. There’s something about watching your leveled-up spells ripping through a hundred skeletons at a time that never gets old. Besides that, trying different characters and loadouts to see what is most effective kept me busy for a long time.

If you’re looking for something entertaining to kill some time, you’d be hard pressed to find something better than this one. But, if you’re looking for something to really sink your teeth into, you might want to look elsewhere. Still, at this price, it’s probably worth picking up anyway.",1702407916,1702407916,True,58,1,0.756323516368865967,0,True,False,False

I was initially hesitant on buying it on Steam, but then I eventually read an article somewhere saying the game was also free on Android which I then tried it out during an international flight. 

It ended up being one of those games where you have to play it to really understand the appeal, since the trailers alone hardly looked convincing. I really had blast though, enough that I decided to buy it on Steam anyway for the couple of dollars it was worth. 

For a game where the only means of playing is by moving around and choosing your upgrades, it's is wildly addicting. 

My only complaint is how easy the game gets. The game eventually becomes so easy that you have to plan out what handicaps you want to find yourself a challenge. From that, it would be nice if there was an in-game ""Challenge"" list to do specific scenarios with limitations.

Edit: I finished the game, then I bought the DLC for two bucks. And I never usually buy DLCs. It's that good of a game.",1673383687,1702304544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The proverbial rabbit hole into a budding genre, ""reverse bullet horde action roguelike survivor"" that was the first to hook me (and the best). 

Vampire Survivors hits a spot. With that sit down and play simplicity, it's not difficult to grasp what needs to be done in the early stages. Survive...

...And it feels good to mow down a revolving carousel of enemies of all shapes, sizes and colors. In fact, seeing what horrors lie beyond the next 5 minute mark is all part of the appeal. 

Then there's the choices, they come in that perfect steady stream. Bit by bit, your pitiful projectiles give way to whole new beast of destruction pixel pizzazz. Spinning axes, whizzing cats, explosions, magic, and powers beyond (at least my) imagination. It all adds up to some kind of coherency in your mind and total chaos on the screen. Unless you look for the patters beneath. 

That's what has got me so impressed with this genre. Drawing from tried and true mechanics, hearkening to schmups, bullet hell, deckbuilder, ARPG, and who-know-what's-next, these games are all trying to pack that right blend of variables. And we're getting picky. If the progression doesn't feel right or the movement is off...it's only a matter of time before it shows. 

Vampire Survivors is a labor and love and these variables have all been tweaked to near perfection whilst still allowing plenty of room for evolution (see DLC, but additionally see collab with Among Us!). This game is certainly not going anywhere and I have no doubt will continue to offer a lot.

The achievements, secrets, challenges, and just straight up experimenting or pushing your PC's framerate to the limits is a powerful continuum of reasons that this game and others will no doubt continue to evolve.

The characters, weapons, vocabulary, levels, and the ever endearing treasure box techno party will always hold a special place in my gaming heart. I'll be looking at many other games in the genre going forward, with some notable releases for sure. 

Perhaps not the textbook 'original' or not even 'the best', Vampire Survivors is a phenomena, a great game and testament to a developers creativity. People love playing games that just hit that spot!",1651275073,1702229218,True,1,1,0.51841360330581665,0,True,False,False

I bought this game and all of its DLC for like 9 bucks when I was sick and have almost no lifed this game since. I absolutely adore bullet hells and the way this game spins that formula on its head in a new and interesting way was exactly what the genre needed. The thing that also separates this game from other bullet hells and especially Vampire Survivors clones is just the amount of content. Even on the surface this game has so much to do, but somehow there's EVEN MORE to do under the surface. The end game has end game content, the bosses have bosses, the DLC has DLC, and the music goes so fucking hard. Just how many times the devs seemed to say to themselves, ""fuck it, let's add more because we can"" absolutely astonishes me and is the reason I love this game and it's one of my favorite games literally ever. As someone who loves achievements, I also adore the fact that game progression is tied directly to the achievements so 100%ing the game isn't tedious and is as simple as just beating the game and unlocking everything. It makes the dopamine in my brain very happy and probably the other main reason this is one of my favorite games ever. I wish more games would do this. 

Much recommend if you want to play casually, or no life the game for 65+ hours like I did. The one thing I will say though, is that I NEED that Among Us DLC right NOW because now that I've done literally everything there is to do, I don't really know what to do in the game anymore and probably won't open it for a while.  Now does that matter after the amount of time I put into the game already? I'll let you decide for yourself.

Either way I very much enjoyed my time with this game, and for such a low price there's literally no reason to not at least pick the base game up. Support the devs, they deserve it.

Update: even more free updates with adventurer mode. Devs are adding more value to the base game. Greatly appreciated considering how many abandoned games there are on steam.

It gets super easy in the mid-game when you have powered up and know the weapon evolutions. I played almost exclusively on hyper-mode. It's way too slow otherwise.

My play time includes long stretches of just letting it run for hours while nothing could kill me. I didn't even have many golden eggs. When I did come back I had to navigate using the mini-map as you can't see anything. In levels like the milk plant it's a frustrating experience trying to get around when you can't see the walls.

It gets a thumbs up because it was entertaining for the most part, but sometimes headache inducing. Don't expect much challenge after you get enough unlocks.

I've played a lot of survivors but this is, bar none, the most boring. Everything but movement is automated, so if you like those auto-clicker games this might be a nice time sink for you. Even then, movement itself is utterly pointless outside of artificially grafted mechanics such as the coveted vacuum pickup which sucks in all experience gems on the floor, of which there are ALOT; you can't do much in the way of collecting them all because of the nature of the automated attack system. There are also sometimes swarms which occasionally blitz across the screen (forcing you to dodge), which were fun, but as far as I can remember this only happened on the first map.
For a large majority of the level, you could stand completely fixed in one position, never moving, and you would succeed all the same (assuming you passively gained exp).

The graphics are vapid - if not painful to look at, making me feel forced against my own will when I'm told by luminous green arrows to run in one direction across the undifferentiated, bland landscape for some unlockable or additional powerup (and miss all the experience gems in the process; infuriating!)

I think a huge step in terms of making this game more enjoyable would be to reduce the prevalence of the all-encompassing automated gameplay loop. For example, they could give you an option to toggle specific skills at the demand of an assigned hotkey (this way you have an opportunity to reduce the spread of gems and at the same time inject player autonomy into the currently very, very boring equation). Add enemies that do something interesting other than run straight towards you, such as enraging them if you hit them during a visible animation-cue.

At the end of the 30 minute gameplay loop, instead of a thrilling final showdown with some unearthly demon to practise the culmination of your exponential power creep, you are immediately insta killed by an immortal phantom?? I don't understand this. There needs to be some reason for the 30 minutes I just invested into the game. Why is there no boss at the end of the stage?

This game is fun and addictive like the good old nes, Snes and sega games from the days of old and oh the about 80 hours i have put into this game to get every single freakin achivement!

Camera angel - stuck above. i would like it to be further zoomed out or have a unlock option for it.

The Art n graphics - this game has graphics just like the good old days and a art style that will never leave your heart! the art is good and i truly enjoy it!

The music - has truly good music! its not straight rock and roll or metal or Mic Gordon but the music speaks to you and  i enjoy it. 

The Game play - slightly repetitive but you wont mind as you unlock more and more stuff! FEED ME MORE!!!

Tons of secrets and i mean tons of em! they even have a cheat code system in the game which i love!... and only used a little... lol. only real problem with the game is NO ONLINE CO-OP! when it gets that ill give it a 5 out of 5.

In the end - in the end i give it a 4 out of 5. however i would give this game get a 5 out of 5  if it ever gets ONLINE CO-OP which i would be willing to spend 5 dollars more if it came as a add on or whatever. to play this with friends or family in another state would be awesome! 

this game is good all the way through and its easily a 30 dollar game but its under 20! now thats a a deal! this game deserves far more appreciation than it gets! it truly never bites :)

While I enjoyed my time with this game, I'm not going to simply gush over it like everyone else. Definitely buy it on sale, but it's far from perfect. 
I thought I was going to have mostly positive things to say about this, but at the near 100% mark I'm just sick of it and feel that it's overstayed its welcome.
Random weapon selection adds nothing to this game except tedium and frustration. With the random selection gone, you could also do away with the irritating-as-hell re-rolls, banishes, seals, etc., fucking etc. All this does is keep you doing mindless (and endless) pre-flight inspections, when all you really want to do is be up in the air flying.
It's like being handed a delicious slice of ice cream cake, and then having to eat it with a fucking demitasse spoon. Before long, the ice cream begins to melt, and the enjoyment you would have is lost because of pointless frustration. You could have simply got a bigger spoon, and enjoyed the cake before it melted, just like you could simply choose your load out each time and enjoy the game before your interest wanes.
This isn't entirely Vampire Saviour fault... I'm just sick of random shit. How much better would Spelunky 2 be in you could simply CHOOSE the jet pack and plasma gun at the start? If I want to put myself through hell and beat the game with one bomb and a toothpick, THAT SHOULD BE MY FUCKING CHOICE, NOT LEFT UP TO SOME RANDOM FCKING B*LLSH*T ALGORITHM. 
I know the reasoning -""Well everyone else is doing it!"" We all know that's a stupid reason to do anything, but the gaming industry seems hell bent content on all swinging on the same vine. Until it breaks. (Case in point - look how many fucking clones there are of this game already).
Random selection doesn't promote varied weapon and item selection. Well thought out weapon challenges and unlockables that come from clever item utilisation and experimentation handle that already, so in this regard, random selection becomes a moot point. I fail to see how randomization manages to add a single entertaining aspect to this game, or any game in general for that matter (feel free to present your take / viewpoints on this in the comments and prove me wrong). I'm not a fan of restricting choices, especially with a product I payed for. You can blame growing up with Game Genie for that, because it gave me freedom and opened my eyes to a world of possibilities. This random shit feels like the Anti-Game Genie, and we all know the Anti-version of anything is bad (Anti-Monitor, Anti-Christ, ((Aunti-Edna, when she pinches your checks...?)).
While the game does make you feel great mowing down tons of enemies, it can also be equal parts of tedious and flat out boring as well. There's nothing like getting twenty minutes into a level, not taking a single hit, and then having the screen FILL with enemies in seconds... and you're dead. Fucking piss off. 
As much as I felt great mowing down enemies and discovering secrets, I also had times where I literally fell asleep because there was nothing to do except wait for the level to end.
Many times you can't even see the items on the ground, or any of your character except the life bar, which is always present, except when it goes black it's nearly impossible to see.
The game can also be played one handed while eating a sandwich. The lack of complexity in the controls could be a good or bad thing depending on your point of view, but it could also be part of the reason I fell asleep a few times - I prefer more engaging control schemes. To be fair, this is simplistic to the point of being ridiculous. It was clearly made for touch screens from the start.
There's also not a single vampire in the game. There are vampire bats, and lots of references to Castlevania and other video games (Sonic?), but I call that false advertising ( <- this is a joke. If I get one single comment taking this seriously, I'll be upset). In my mind, the only way to justify it is since it's called Vampire Survivors, these are all characters that survived Dracula's castle, and are now trying to escape through hordes of enemies (as you can see, the game gives you a lot of time to come up with stupid shit like this).
At the end of the day, I got my $2.50ish cdn out of it. I've spent money on far stupider things that I got way less enjoyment from.",1682984866,1701957887,True,0,0,0.414286166429519653,0,True,False,False

I know that I can turn off the option, it just gives me less of an incentive to turn it off since it is an option and makes getting the achievements easier. I would rather it not be in the game at all honestly, I just recently came back to get the achievements with a character that has 100,000's of golden eggs just because it was easy to get the achievements.

I highly recommend this game to literally anyone but I do HEAVILY suggest you do not go near golden eggs if you want to experience the game in all of its glory of difficulty.

It's simple yet challenging. 
It's got wonderful vintage vibes without trying too hard. 
It's got little references sprinkled in that are an absolute joy. 
It's got lovely item and enemy descriptions. 

You get to progress and attain new things that keep it interesting for hours and hours and hours while also being excellent for a quick 30 minute game when you don't have the time or energy for much more.

(Because there's already thousands of positive reviews - who's really going to read this? Do kids even actually ""read"" any more?)

More Depth for those that aren't ""tl;dr"" by default in life.

One very important detail I need to make clear about myself...
I NEVER PLAY GAMES LIKE THIS. EVER. I have an appreciation for the retro art style in games. But you see, I'm a grown-ass gamer, old by most kid standards today. I grew up as a little kid with the Atari 2600 (from my older siblings) and an original NES. Lots of good memories. Yet I will never forget the wishing and waiting for the days when graphics truly advanced. Even as a teen in the 90's I knew the ""3d graphics"" of that early era were weak. 

So at this point in life I have no taste to recapture my youth in gaming. I played a lifetime of sidescroll and sprite graphics. I've even had enough low res polygons to fill a second childhood. I DO NOT seek out old style games. I was even dismissive when I first saw VS pop up in my Steam queue, even more as it became a streaming sensation (for however long this lasts.)

Then I finally watched some, a few dudes from Neebs Gaming playing co-op (couch co-op only, no online). I really don't know why but his nudged me to checked it out. -Didn't pick up on the couch co-op only until after purchase.- Despite being disappointed that there is no online co-op (at this time?) I went with it anyway. Now I've spent way way too much time playing games alone, like any normal gamer. So at this point in life I try to avoid single-player stuff and aim for co-op potential. Which lead me to believe I'd get momentary fun out of it. Like 15 minutes. ... I was WRONG.

It IS addictive! Let me explain with my many years and console generations worth of gaming. On the surface it almost seems dumb. You don't even have a fire/attack button! You ONLY move. Everything auto-fires/deploys. The ONLY real effect you have on your loadout/weapons is what you pick when you level up! Early levels will be options for other weapons to use at the same time, or defensive things, or more subtle things like cooldown time, or duration. The MAGIC of the game comes from your choice of combos. Some of which work in conjunction to make very powerful weapons when fully upgraded. At first it feels kind of random. Yet over time there are strategies of combos. You just keep going with it. 

As far as any kind of mobile game, auto-clicker, dopamine trigger games with rewarding sounds, colors, and flashing whatnot is also NOTHING I have any taste for. But this game also feeds you full of it and: I LOVE IT in this game. Those gems start rolling in by the hundreds and it's a constant jingling of points.Level ups feel rewarding. Even the health pick-ups and strike noises all are arcade perfect. The treasure chests also feel really good. The final evolved form of weapons if very rewarding. 

This game has taken SO many little features from old and new genres to create this sense of perfectly distilled classic gaming. It's like a strange modern version of what you imagine all your nostalgic memories of gaming as a kid were like! (weather it be actually lived or inherited nostalgia from the gaming life) This really has taken something so simple and purified even more into basically a free-base version of oldschool gaming. Straight to the brain. The hardest part is getting my right hand to let go of the mouse since there's no use.

Oh even the music Kicks the Hell out of All the Ass! All chiptune yet so amazingly perfect for this. I always turn down the music in games... this one I forgot and I am glad! 

It's also a great palette cleanser. You don't need hundreds of constant hours. Lots of rounds may only be a few minutes. 15 minutes is a good run. 30 minutes completes the level I think? But by then, if you make it to the last few minutes, you'll be in such a gaming zen state that it's a whole other thing!

I [b]ADORE[/b] this game in a very weird & unique way. But I still have a lot of gripes, of course.

I have to mention that one of my most hated genres is the rogue-like/lite genre.
And while this is a rogue-lite game, it's one that actually decides to strike out & do something unique with its genre. Creating a spin that's so vast that it created a whole new genre within the rogue genre. Very impressive! I congratulate the developers very honestly.
It's also why I appreciate games like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/mossfan1/recommended/1313140] Cult of the Lamb [/url] so much, as they're rogue games that actually decide to do something different & noteworthy with their genres instead of following the formulaic tendency the vast majority of other rogue games follow. [i]ugh.[/i]

But just like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/mossfan1/recommended/1313140] Cult of the Lamb[/url], I'm not sure if I'll ever actually want to get around to beating them.
They're neat games that I've obviously decided to spend quite a few notable hours on, but they're still honor-bound rogue games -- of which is enough to off-set me from finishing them due to solely that. The only rogue game that I've ever come to enjoy enough to actually beating it would be Hellboy: Web of Wyrd.



[h1] Progression Pondering [/h1]

Anyways, moving on from my nonchalant Hellboy: Web of Wyrd shoutout I want to comment on this game's progression.
I don't enjoy it. Kinda.
I'd so much rather prefer the game stuck to simply reaching a certain kill count or reaching a certain time alive within a level to unlock the next one. Because some of these are so darn niche & specific that they crave me to research how to even beat them, because they're on the verge of feeling like discovering some niche easter egg or something more than actual necessary progression. I do not enjoy that.
I wish I could dissect my brain's thought vastly more to translate my raging thoughts into words... but 'nay, just WOW. WOW... I can't even verbalize my frustrations. It's really that outlandish? What the hell were they thinking?
Especially since so much of it is purely luck based or grind based. Not fun.



[h1] The Anti-'Bullet Hell' Game [/h1]

I've heard this game described as an anti-'bullet hell' kind of game, where you create the bullets instead of dodging them. And I cannot agree more!
The combat is great & it becomes greatly enthralling late-game when you've got most of your power-ups from the run maxed out & trying to survive these ever-lasting hordes of enemies, as you desperately try to slither through wherever there should open a new hole from recently killed enemies. Absolutely lovely.
It keeps you constantly on your toes & quite engaged.
It can be a tad sluggish during the start of the round where you don't have a lot of attacks & there are only very few enemies. But it luckily doesn't take too long to get truly started.

A lot of the unlocks per run & permanent ones are very creative & often very fun to play around with.
I appreciate the creativity that has went into this, even if it goes a little overboard at times like the level progression.



[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Listen, I have a lot of shit to say about this game. Negative & positive kinds of shit; both the kind of shit that sprays everywhere but also the kind that just keeps hitting your g-spot as you push it out. Yeah.

Still, I do mostly have fun while playing this game on a moment-to-moment basis. So I feel comfortable recommending this game, regardless of my harsh complaints.",1701554730,1701721966,True,4,0,0.554451227188110352,0,True,False,False

But keep in mind this is like a walking simulator because you don't actually control the attacks other than what direction they will travel. 

But I keep seeing comments saying this game is highly addictive and i just can't get behind that. I think Path of Exiles offers more entertainment in spades.
 
I will still say yes for other people to buy this game though because its price is so low.

I've been playing this on a non-gaming laptop as well as on the Steam Deck. It works just fine on the Steam Deck, without toying around with it too hard (I just choose the standard boot option, from a choice of 3 available when you launch the game).

This game only *looks* like a twin-stick shooter. In fact, you don't actively do any of the shooting. This game is all about unlockables and challenges. You start with a base set of characters that each have a weapon type. The weapons in this game are automatically deployed based on whatever rules the weapon follows (for example, a basic whip will arc around in front of you, similar to Capcom's Strider arcade game; or some ""holy water"" will fall from above every X amount of time, create a circle of fire on the floor with Y radius and last for N amount of time on the floor). You can learn each character that you have available, learn their base weapons, and then as you upgrade those, you unlock the ability to acquire those for other characters as well. 

You accumulate new characters and their base weapons for use in future runs and that's what keeps this game going.

So this game resembles a twin-stick shooter in appearance, in that you are on a map which is basically an infinitely-scrollable arena and face monsters along the way that come at you in waves in a way. As you kill, you can collect dropped XP which you use to level up. There's also a currency system for unlocking permanent stat buffs in the main menu, as well as being able to use that cash on a merchant for temporary items during future runs (merchant must be unlocked, as does most of the features of this game).

The game opens up a lot over time, going from only a couple of main menu options to unlocking new maps, new modes, a secrets menu, a bestiary, and more. The base-length for a standard run can top out at about 30 minutes, at which point the game generally forces you to die. There are alternate modes you can unlock (like hyper, endless, and more) which switch this up for your liking as well.

There's one ""secret"" objective in the game that basically caused my laptop to struggle (only onboard intel graphics, on an I7 11xxx series processor with 32gb RAM and an nvme SSD), otherwise the game has run just fine on my laptop. The secret involved essentially leaving the map in a trippy ""out of reality"" kind of teleport which then places you temporarily on a different map, and that entire sequence was too intense for a non-gaming device based on the visuals of that entire sequence. I made it through after a few minutes of extremely choppy gameplay, where then once the map reverted back, my performance went back to normal. 

I've mostly played using the Xbox 360 wired gamepad for Windows as well. You spend most of the time just using your left analog stick (or moving with the keyboard), while the game otherwise plays itself according to whatever rules are in motion (based on buffs, unlocks, debuffs, etc.).

For the price I paid ($4), it's a fun *almost* auto-play game, and being loaded with objectives and achievements is the incentive to keep going, aside from any personal goals you give yourself (like trying to beat a level without upgrades, or with only 1 weapon, etc.).

I'd recommend checking out some gameplay videos if you're on the fence, otherwise if you appreciate twin stick-style arena shooters, you will likely enjoy this as well!",1667550528,1701593608,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★★
_____________________________

The core gameplay loop of battling through waves of enemies in procedurally generated levels is deceptively simple yet incredibly addictive. The variety of playable characters each with unique abilities adds depth to the strategy, ensuring that each run feels fresh and exciting. The balance between risk and reward, especially when choosing upgrades, keeps you on your toes and constantly engaged.

The pixel art style is both charming and functional, providing a clear and visually appealing backdrop for the chaos that unfolds on the screen. The game's simplicity doesn't sacrifice its aesthetic appeal, and the enemy designs add a delightful touch to the overall atmosphere.

The progression system, where you unlock new characters and abilities over time, adds a layer of long-term engagement. It strikes a perfect balance, encouraging players to keep coming back for more without feeling overly grindy.

In conclusion, Vampire Survivors is a testament to the beauty of indie game design. It takes a simple concept and executes it flawlessly, delivering an addictive and rewarding experience. Whether you're a fan of roguelites or just looking for a game that's easy to pick up and play, Vampire Survivors deserves a spot in your library. It's a solid 5/5 in my book—a true testament to the joy it brings to players.",1701267076,1701267076,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I ironed a shirt.  Nothing happened.

In all seriousness though, if you are REALLY on the fence about this game like I was, you'll be disappointed at first and wonder why you spent that money for just 4 levels with potato graphics and potato story.  Then you'll discover a bunch of global upgrades and unlocks (including more levels - but the graphics and story remain potato), you'll figure out your favorite combos, and become a true force to be reckoned with as you fill the screen with evolved weapons fire to the point you can hardly see anything happening.  If all goes well, the game loop mostly turns into a Sitting Simulator around the 22 minute mark...every loop.  You vacuumed up thousands of gems and applied 50 or so upgrades.  You worked hard for the moment.  So let that addicting dopamine rush settle in.  Then repeat it all again until 2 am.  The best part of this game is you can play as little as a single 15 or 30 minute round (depending on the level) and the RNG aspects are generally quite decent (i.e. it's rare to fail due to bad RNG).",1701219721,1701219721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You won't have to worry about [strike]criticals[/strike] and evasions (or dodges).

Edit: They added criticals from the patch 5.0, but only for certain weapons, okay.

↑ This is me reviewing the early access of the game. 

And now, we're here, on the official release on the game. I really like the game ever since I bought it since February (It wasn't even on sale, but the $3 I spent here was totally worth it). You really become the bullet hell on this, simple game, and the only thing you do is to move (and sometimes dodge), pick up chests and select your weapons/items. By playing this game, you will never realized how much time did you waste playing on this game, and I like it. This would be my best game of 2022, because of the soundtrack, as well as the effort on delivering updates in either every 2 weeks or a month since early access.

Edit: I noticed yesterday, the mobile version of this game has been already released like a week ago. Now, we can play Vampire Survivors literally anywhere with your phone (except save files from PC to mobile isn't possible).

There's [i]lots of secret gaming content[/i] as well. For example, at the given stage of a session there's the Reaper appears and instantly kills your character. Seems like an end, right? Well, yes. [i]But no[/i]. 😁 The Reaper can be defeated under certain conditions. And not only that: if you do it, the Reaper becomes available as a playable character! [i]Isn't it fascinating?![/i] 😱

The developers continue to [i]actively update and expand[/i] their creation. Two DLCs have been released at the moment; each of them has its own theme, adds a [i]very detailed and atmospheric stages[/i] (with new enemies, quests, items) as well as [i]several unique characters and abilities[/i]. Overall they feels like a breath of fresh air.

[i]The co-op update[/i] forced me to play the game with my wife. She's not a gamer type, you know; but we tried co-op a few times. And now on launching Vampire Survivors I always hear something like [i]What do you think you doin', sumbitch?! Gimme the gamepad![/i] 😁 Love her; it's great fun to play together.

Surely can't insist; but [i]consider the game[/i].

its so simple that it really SHOULDNT be fun.

 it's so addictive that once I start a run i CANNOT stop until I finish the whole thing,, though my only issue is that unlocking the evo weps is really annoying without a guide, because you're just guessing at combinations. and if you guess wrong, well then I'm playing the next half hour with sub optimal weapons, which isn't that fun.

i love how innovative the game is when they REMOVED skipped manual shooting and focused hard on making the weapon progression super satisfying, they NAILED it. the high point of the game is definitely unlocking new mechanics in each of the base stages, that HOOKED me so hard, and its like each new relic totally redefines the game",1700937946,1701142747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is dynamic and strategic, making each playthrough an enjoyable experience. The continuous updates and DLCs have expanded the game in mind-blowing ways, offering new challenges and surprises.

However, there are a couple of things that could be improved:

Firstly, the tooltip that appears after opening treasure chests disappears too quickly, and it would be more beneficial if it consistently reappeared, giving players enough time to grasp the information.

Additionally, customizable navigation arrows for items would be a valuable improvement, allowing players to adjust their size or color scheme for better visibility during intense moments.

There seems to be an FPS-related issue, as the hero can pass through objects like middle libraries, pianos, or even the boundaries of water and forest when the areas are crowded with enemies, affecting the overall experience.

Lastly, while the opening animations for treasure chests add excitement, having a toggle option to skip or increase the animation speed, particularly for epic and legendary chests, would address varying player preferences and streamline the overall experience.",1701110716,1701110716,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You know it's good when you revive an old style of game and everyone is copying your game!

Gameplay : 10/10 (Move, avoid enemies, find secrets, challenge yourself with different build, what a pleasant ride)
Story : 6/10 (The lore of each enemies and characters is nice bit of reading, but no main story per say)
Music : 10/10 (Each level got it's music and there a remix if you add different modifier, perfect!)
Graphic : 8/10 (8 Bits of pure pixely mess when get strong enough, but that's the point!)
Replayability : 10/10 (Try to finish all level with all characters, you'll dig so deeps in the hours that it will turn to weeks.)

Pro
- Lot's of enemies and way to play, but when you find your build you'll mostly stick to it.
- Lot's of free updates and DLC content, never had a boring moment whit this game.

Con
- No Vampires
