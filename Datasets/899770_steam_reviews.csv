All those aspects come into play if you even get a chance to load into the game. Most of the time I got stuck in 30 minute long loadingscreens from character selection, got into a login queue with over 40k people in front of me not moving a single position in 30 minutes. Also those problems only happen randomly so it could be that your friends get in even if you dont. 

The game in general looks and plays fine, there are a few awkward decisions made e.g. the fact you have to move with LMB and cant change it to RMB, but nothing you couldnt get over. 

In conclusion: imo if you wanna play with friends give it a week or two. If you wanna play solo but have online interactions also give it time aswell, if you wanna play solo for gameplay and story only and dont need any online interactions you can just enjoy it on full offline mode and you should be more than fine. Just keep in mind that characters created in online mode can only play online and offline characters can only stay offline.

While that's obviously not ideal, and negative feedback is fair, these issues were to be expected. The developers have been in constant communication and are clearly working around the clock to get things fixed. Performance has increased dramatically over the last 48 hours or so. I sincerely hope the people leaving the negative reviews will come back to adjust/remove them when the issues are fixed. But given the horribly toxicity of some of these people...I doubt it. 

Regardless, there's a 100% offline mode that worked perfectly fine throughout this launch, but of course it means giving up on some social online-only features. 

Now to the actual review. If you're sick of Diablo 4's simple gameplay, lack of endgame, bad and underwhelming seasons, the general disconnect and cluelessness of its devs, and the beyond obnoxious monetization... If you're interested in POE but find the new player experience too overwhelming and confusing... Then Last Epoch is the game for you! LE is perfectly in the middle of D4's simple themepark experience and POE's overwhelming abundance of systems. 

All of the subclasses (masteries) have their own unique identity and playstyle and they're all viable. While plenty of guides exist you'll be perfectly fine if you just use some common sense and put your build together yourself. Between the monoliths, the 3 dungeons, and the arena there's plenty to do in the endgame. It's obviously not quite as mature as POE yet, but it's a lot better than anything D4 has to offer. There's no 'uber Duriel mats' grind; you can just jump straight in. 

It has target farming for specific items, it has a robust loot filter, it has plenty of stash space. It's very generous with loot and gold. Because of the loot filter you can actually play the game and don't have to spend half of your playtime painstakingly sorting through an inventory full of items. The elaborate crafting system allows you to adjust your items, or create them from scratch. 

If you're not interested in the social features like grouping, trading, etc there's the offline mode!

There was so much to do, especially late game, and I only had a few months to wait for ""full release"" that I got my 30 or so hours in right then and there. Before releasing officially this game was totally worth the money I spent on it, which is more than a lot of EA titles can say.

Official release and there is TONS of stuff to do, especially in that sweet sweet late game. Never find myself being bored, always something to cycle between, grind for, murder, or optimize. I've been discovering things, too. The two factions based around loot drop, or trading, are really interesting and fun to engage with. Characters have THOUSANDS of possibilities even before you find a legendary that ""defines"" a build (which I still haven't really).

Granted, release was rough, hence the totally reasonable negative reviews during that 3 or 4 day window, and we are still dealing with some small lag spikes. There are still optimization issues with network on their end, and some graphics settings that cause FPS spikes, and dips, on higher end computers. I am playing on the lowest of settings on purpose, long before I heard any complaints about said FPS drops, and do so BECAUSE I am so used to spiking FPS. I also get some lag during play, especially when I use a traversal skill (teleport).

I played D4 and got bored very quickly. There isn't much to ""figure out"" in D4. 

I played POE and sunk a LOT of time into it but it felt ""too hard"" to do the figuring out. Never made it to late game with a single character (I have issues with skills being so heavily tied to drops, being literal items you need to equip.)

This really is that nice middle space for dumb old dad who has a job and two kids to deal with, and I GREATLY appreciate that.

It's addictive and that's a good thing when it comes to games. It falls somewhere between D2 and PoE in terms of complexity so it's not as daunting to get into.

As for the endgame content, I don't know how good it is going to be on release.

# PROS
- Crafting is wonderful, incites you to stop in random scenic locations to tinker with stuff
- Visually vibrant with creative creature designs
- Builds are kinda fun the first time if you find skills that affect other skills...

# CONS
- Completely un-engaging narrative/world, if that's something you care about in an ARPG, delivered as text+sometimes-voice where you have to stand and watch scrolling dialog, instead of things occurring in-game bar 1 or 2 exceptions.. and even if you stand listening to these clowns it's uhm... yeah
- Aesthetic very ostentatiously-anime-ish, and lacked... levity? lacked something... reminiscent of early 2000s fantasy kingdom sims in how it's a bit gaudy and takes itself a bit too seriously despite this, see for yourself
- Endgame: you're funnelled into monoliths, these are just a gear grind without much to grind said gear FOR beyond the joy of... having gear for a build for... reasons. There is an arena-survival thing and a dungeon too but... eh, they could look at some warcraft 3 custom maps for inspiration of what more interesting endgame activities could look like
- Lacks longer-term hooks (e.g. PoE's open-ended complexity, diablo4's open worldiness), a very is-what-it-is situation, which may simply be enough for many anyway
- Some of the combat felt a little not-fluid, ended up picking skills that felt better to compensate which is maybe a worry if your desired build-stuff happens to feel jank
- Game's central loop is very samey as a result of all prior ""cons"", but is you know.. in typical ARPG fashion, kinda relaxing to zone out to and do other things meanwhile, so, hard to criticise it too hard really

# OVERALL
If, for you, the price is worth a single romp through a campaign where you ignore the story, make a crazy build and explode some things, crescendo-ing into a pretty fun little boss fight at the end where resistances matter, with some cool crafting downtime, go for it.
Personally, to get my attention back after that initial play-through, this would need more endgame, social hooks, better-feeling combat, replace the narrative... so I don't expect any of that to happen considering the cost, BUT the space areas are wonderful to chill in, they had some serious atmosphere, so there's that... and I can absolutely see myself randomly playing this for a day or 2 in a few years time on a whim, so... if there was a thumb-sideways, i'd have selected that",1708862237,1708862701,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What I've rarely seen is the CEO of the company keeping the community updated on the status of the servers, while [i]also[/i] playing the game, according to his Discord status. That's commitment right there.

Also, keep in mind that the number of CCU (concurent users) had previously peaked at 40k in March 2023, that's when they released the multiplayer update. They had 150k CCU on launch. And those numbers only kept increasing in the next few days. I'm not shilling for the game or whiteknighting the devs, I'm just asking everyone to cut them some slack. 

I bought a copy of the game in January 2024, so I had a good one month of playing the game before the actual launch, so here are my impressions. The game itself is very, very good. The best collection of systems that I've seen in an ARPG - deep enough while managing to not be overwhelming. The graphics and animations leave some to be desired, but they're easily on par with anything else on the market that is not Diablo 4. People would often say that the combat is floaty and feels worse than other games in the genre, but I don't really see it. The endgame is simple, but good enough, and offers a lot of scalability. The campaign is decent and the story is interesting, but hard to follow. The two factions are a great idea and they offer a lot of account-wide bonuses. Last Epoch has the best stash system, allowing you to buy as many tabs as you want for in-game currency. The microtransactions are cosmetic-only, and the pricing is [i]extremely[/i] fair. The same goes for the special editions. I'd say that the supporter packs are a bit overpriced for what they are, but they have ""supporter"" in the title, so you know what you're actually paying for.

The game could be a bit more alt-friendly. Currently you can't skip the campaign [i]per se[/i], although you can skip some parts of it through dungeons. Pretty much everything stash- and inventory-related is shared between alts in the same game mode (e.g. Cycle-Softcore, or Legacy-Hardcore, etc.), including the faction reputation and favor. There are still some bugs, mostly visual ones, but on occasion you can run into other things. The stash has a search function, which is great in theory, but it doesn't work quite like you'd expect it to. E.g. you can search for ""fire"" or ""resistance"", but ""fire resistance"" won't actually work. The campaign is not finished, there are a few more chapters that are expected to drop in the future. Long story short, there are things to nitpick for sure, but I expect that most of these will get fixed in time.

I really tried hard not to jump into a negative review, as I really enjoyed playing it for more than 2 years, but after 3 days of suffering.  The online issues are not new issues, they knew about it since at least March 2023 but here we are.

update (25/11/2024):
A post was sent today in the official discord having the links to the original issue and showing that it's not a new one as I stated above:

To everyone that thinks this is normal issues to have on release read this:

-This game was built from the ground up as a standalone offline singleplayer game due to budget restrictions when they first started making the game.
-Online Multiplayer was added in the 0.9 early access patch last year in march 2023, and ever since then they've had the same exact problems that were never fixed.

--Here is some early access reviews of the game when the online multiplayer patch released last year (you can see the dates):

I'm playing it solo offline and don't use any guides for now, just exploring the world and different classes - the builds can be found by players easily, skills and their synergies are quite advanced but easy to understand at the same time. Last Epoch offers three late game systems currently - arenas where the player needs to defend against waves of enemies; dungeons and monoliths that similar to Path of Exile maps that offers different loot options as rewards and more difficult bosses from the campaign. The released version has two guilds that become available in Act 9 - Merchant's Guild that enables trading with other players (doesn't work in offline) and Circle of Fortune that provides better loot and so called prophecies with quests like ""Kill 7 rare monsters in Monolith"" that reward various rare, unique and set items.

The game is very entertaining although the servers are in a really bad shape at the moment which is the reason why the game gets so many negative reviews recently. The developers are very open and communicating with the community on Discord, forums and Reddit trying to fix the server issues. If you plan to play online with trading or want to play with your friends, it's better to wait until these problems are fixed before buying the game, otherwise you risk to spoil the impression and get a very frustrating experience with  not being able to log in, get randomly disconnected or have long loading screens between zones.

I highly recommend to give this game a try and wish developers all best to fix the launch issues. Looking forward to play this game for a long time and hope that it will be one of the best competitors to Path of Exile.",1708861183,1708861183,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My fears about abandonware did not materialise. The developers have continued to work on the product and were finally able to release version 1.0 in February 2024.

Of course, there are the usual problems at the beginning. Either too many players or too few servers. Queues even 4 days after the release, waiting times of minutes to be able to enter a zone. Okay, most players will just pop in to have a look anyway and then leave it alone. The developers would be pretty stupid if they set up new servers, they would have to take them down again in three months at the latest.

Okay, the classes don't seem to have changed that much. The classes that aren't available yet don't read exciting enough for me, with the exception of the falconer. But I have to wait a long time before I can play them, that took a crazy long time during Early Access.

The graphics seem to have improved, and the font in the game is a bit nicer. Five skills, the choice of which should be carefully considered. Skills with their own talent trees.

I haven't played that much yet, my druid is only level 12, but apart from the waiting times, it makes a good impression. Negative mana is still possible, it also seems to be a game mechanic that doesn't make sense to me. I wonder if life can become negative without having to die ;) I'm currently playing with the Woelfen and Lightning Strike, and that's fun. More fun than Diablo 4 - where I really struggled to get to the end of the main quest.

There is a permanent offline mode. This is very rewarding, and the first few hours in version 1.0 make it very interesting. Not because of the waiting times, but because the chat is full of links to any items found. It's a pain in the arse, but that's how today's players are. ""Look what I've found.""

Since you obviously can't live off the sales from Early Access in the long term, there is a cometic shop, similar to Path of Exile. Blizzard, you should get some creative inspiration for what cosmetic items should look like! I haven't looked at the prices in detail. 100 points for the store cost 10 euros. A cosmetic item for the back costs between 50 and 100 points, depending on the effort involved. At the moment there are three complete armour sets available, for 150, 200 and 250 points, i.e. for 15 to 25 euros.

When you create a character, you can not only choose between offline and online, but also whether you want to create a ""Legacy"" or a ""Cycle"" character. This ""Cycle"" seems to correspond to the Seasons in Diablo 4. Whether there are any special mechanics is not yet clear to me, but leaderboards definitely are.

Diablo 4 was extremely disappointing. I haven't played Path of Exile since the first PoE 2 announcement. I never warmed to Grim Dawn and am currently waiting for the add-on. If the skill tree in Path of Exile is too complicated for you, if Diablo 4 is too simple, you might be happy with Last Epoch. A manageable skill tree for the main class, a manageable skill tree for the specialisation, and five skills that can be adapted to your own play style via your own skill trees.

I enjoy the game, it offers enough depth for the character to be able to experiment, and it's definitely worth a look.

I played the game with German texts, which I quickly changed to English. Either there was no localisation in Early Access or I didn't notice it, but for reasons of cost they seem to have run it through some online translator.

...the same bugs I encountered in Early Access are still there. 

A non-exhaustive list:

- Early in the campaign, using a town portal at the wrong time will seemingly halt your progress, until you Google for a fix (which was posted back in 2022, when players first reported the issue).
- You still can't compare both of your equipped rings.
- Controller support is still garbage. Want to remap Y? Click on ""Remove mapping"", then try to bind it to another skill: ""Can't rebind Y because it's already assigned"". Changing skills on your bar requires the use of an emulated mouse, because the UI wasn't thoroughly adapted for controller use. Diablo 3 (!) already had a great blueprint for controller support in ARPG's, why not copy what works for others?
- Your FPS will randomly tank until you restart the game. NO FSR support, by the way. CPU is barely utilized while your GPU already starts cooking on the character selection screen. 
- Multiplayer launch in 0.9 was absolutely terrible, with horrid map loading times because their matchmaking service is just broken. Guess what, it didn't magically fix itself when their CCU quadrupled with 1.0.
- Oh, and the story? Not finished. It ends abruptly with promises to add the last 3 chapters after launch. ""But PoE did the same, who cares about story in an ARPG""? Well, I do, and another game setting a bad example isn't an excuse.
- Not the game's fault, but LE's community is quite frankly childish and unpleasant. Expect your chat to be filled with ""dae think d4 bad? amiright or what?"" day in and day out. We get it, D4 sucked, fully agree. But maybe it's time to move on, now that you have an alternative? Plus, don't dare to criticize EHG or aspects of the game openly, they can't handle that. Also has one of the worst gaming subreddits out there, run by EHG itself. 

EHG's lack of experience shows at every corner of the game, and while one might be able excuse that for an indie developer, the dishonesty of releasing a game before it's ready simply isn't acceptable.

""Engrossing Character Customisation"" is in the store page description, but the game has zero character customisation. Which is fine for an ARPG (even tho their base models are horrendous), but it's extremely misleading. Little details just put me off, like looking at lily pads in the water and they were all carbon copies of eachother facing the same direction. The voice acting is pretty good for being from an indie studio. Odd that some letters are voice acted while others aren't, and if you click to speed up the dialogue as it rolls into existence, it just skips it instead. The build customisation is very good, probably up there with Path of Exile. The auto targeting needs some work, you move your mouse to face the enemy you want to attack, and if it's not on the enemy, you may just attack past them instead. 

The community was immediately toxic, even before I said anything. I asked if there was any form of character customisation since I expected to see it in character creation, and this set off the entire global chat. It felt like they were defending any small aspect of the game because they spent the money on it and are trying to convince themselves it's good. 

The shop wasn't thrown in my face, and it is purely cosmetic, but feels predatory as it claims everything you buy helps fund the games production and future updates, despite you just paying for the game itself. It kind of felt like a Korean Gotcha game because of this, but not nearly as bad. You can get a set of wings or something if you buy [insert pack here] and you should def buy it so the game can one day be good.

Anyways, I'm going to go play Hello Kitty: Island Adventure like the community suggested I do.

Edit: So when I looked at the shop and saw the over-the-top cosmetics, I really got gotcha vibes from it. Doing a very small amount of searching, I find that they're partnered with Tencent games. They have been since before the game was in development. It really connected the dots for me. If you don't know Tencent games, they're known for making Pay-2-Win Mobile games.

Now with 1.0 release I will keep it as negative but for other reasons.
- Visual quiality. Game looks.. okaish, They definitely improved visuals but core animations and skills look bad. Clunky, goofy, not impactful, half-baked, some are on a junk level (yes, fireball, I'm looking at you)
- Sound. You don't notice how important is sound until you play a game with bad sound effects and sound design in general. It amplifies other problems the game have and makes them feel even worse than they are in reality. Combat sound effects are just flat.
- Combat feel. The engine feels weird, combat feels weird. You can walk through enemies and while you clearly see that their attacks are not connecting with you, you are getting damage. But on the other hands its very often when your attacks do not connect at all when you target is moving even a little bit. All together makes combat feel too aritfical or nominal(symbolic).
- Character progression and itemization. Even though its clearly has more depth than d4, but its not as much, as you would like to see. Its simplistic and quite quickly falls into looking through countless amounts of items (hello d4). Yes, loot filters exist and help, but it actually makes the problem worse, because you end up knowing exactly what drops to expect and have 0 excitement when you get them. Itemization system without dopamine hits is just wrong. And it actually is closer to d4, than it is to a better games of the genre.
- Lack of content ( Or more like it feels boring). Not much to say. Monolith is boring, dungeons are boring. Maybe it will change with time, who knows. If game at least FELT great or rewarding enough, i wouldn't mind blasting through simplistic content. But it isn't and I find myself getting bored way too quickly, than I wanted to.
Its a bit overhyped atm, and time will show will it be able to live up to the hype or not. Hope this game will become better and arpg market will have real competition. ",1663258175,1708858699,False,5,1,0.492028594017028809,0,True,False,True

It feels very clunky, especially in combat, where it has the fluidity of a rock.

My 2 cents of the game: 
- campaign is boring and I do not remember anything from it (the fact that currently you cannot respec your specialization and you need to create a new char and do part of the campaign for the specialization is annoying)
- crafting system is decent, still can be improved a lot
- merchant vs fortune factions is a nice touch for the ARPG genre, I personally like it, but it can also be further improved
- build diversity I observed is quite nice
- the UI has a huge load of bugs, but I expect those to be fixed in time

I personally played a Necromancer specialized in the Bone Golem and the campaign, the dungeons and the monoliths felt like a breeze (I quit @level 76) but became quickly repetitive.

Issues encountered with my build: Minion AI is trash, encounters with barriers will absolutely annoy the living hell out of you and the buff I needed to give my minion every minute or so a lot of the times does not apply (most likely a bug, but when it is your build enabling thing it will frustrate you a lot)

I quit quickly because I feel I have experienced the current bread and butter of the game and I do not want it to leave me disappointed. I will come back in 6 months or a year to see the status of the game since I believe it has huge potential.

Biggest pro of this game is that it still is better than D4 (my worst 100$ spent ever) by a lot, so if you enjoyed that garbage you will love this game as it is right now.

More complex than Diablo, less complex than PoE. Lots of customization which leads to replayability.

You're never really punished for changing your build as the cost is only gold (you cant change your Mastery, so choose this carefully!).

Endgames is good, but leaves alot to grow into. Uniques can make a build very... unique? Any the ability to add 4 additional affixes to them makes them some of the best items in the game.

It sits neatly between the ultra casual simplicity of Diablo, and the 'needs a Masters Degree' complexity of PoE.

Combat is satisfying, with enemy spells and attacks telegraphed well, and most importantly, very clearly. Minion builds are especially refreshing in that they are effective, act predictably, and are controllable.

The game at it's core and it's mechanics are fun. The endgame content is obviously not at a level of a game that's been released 10 years ago but at the same time, it has much more depth than a particular game released about a year ago that costs 70$ to play. Considering how little studio EHG is, the amount of content in the game is massive. Hopefully we'll be seeing more variation in the endgame though. Not really a fan of objective-based monolith system.

That said, server stability issues are a complete fiasco on their end. Long transitions between zones have been a thing ever since they'd added multiplayer in early access. The loading screens were definitely not as exaggerated as right now but it often took 1-2 min to change zones in previous players peaks (60k players).

I am coming from PoE (which has frustrating servers this season). I am certainly a noob but still an enjoyer of PoE. Coming to LE made me feel quite different. LE just is not stressful. I did not reach endgame in any of the two, but I can tell LE feels more laidback and this is something I sometimes need. The game is pretty and the visuals of the world design are really really nice: versatile and detailed. The mechanics are mostly fun, except the assassin is quite dull but with high DPS. but most of the time skills can be altered well enough to fit to a play style. Game still has bugs and visual glitches which can be frustratring at times, but i bet they will be solved during full release. The translation into German is bad. The dialog text is written with no mistakes, but system information like stat description etc. is just wrong in various cases. They must have used a bad translator software. Therefore play it in English. The story presentation is better than in PoE. Although the story seems a bit generic, while PoE has quite some depth. PoE story is just edgy and cruel and LE feels ""less violent"".
Also I don`t need a PhD to understand the games mechanics.",1708419414,1708856359,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Played just a Marksman then realized that Flurry and explosive arrow are bugged and projectiles go through mobs. Wanted to switch to blade dancer.... nope, not allowed. So played hail of arrows until empowered monoliths. It fell off hard.

Almost all top builds require legendary's (much like D4 does, the thing i hated most about it) and you need to target farm to get them until the market place comes out in v1.0... so have fun running the same thing over... and over... and over again as the target farming is kinda shit. There's vary little variation in mobs, maps and content so it all feels the same. Most mobs are reskins of each other.. same skills, different look.

Skills just all feel kinda meh. Nothing stood out on the marksman or felt good with the exception of cinder strike which is a generator mostly (can change to spender).

May be try again at v1.0... paid the 40 eur but there's already a much better game out (PoE) and much better newer game (PoE2) in May (beta), both free and has less aggressive monetization that the paid LE.

Unfortunately, the servers are still garbage and even worse off due to the high traffic.

I've seen this issue pop up a couple times in the past couple of days and it's ANNOYING.

Game Overview
The game has promise, but the dev team needs to move fast and fix the game servers ASAP. The longer they take, the more players they lose to another flavor of the month game. Coming back from player population loss is a long and arduous task. For a data driven team, there also doesn't seem to be much research done on how the servers would react to a potentially huge amount of week 1 players.

Pros:
-Customizable loot filter
-Varied character builds
-Okay itemization

Cons:
-Online servers are taking a beating and have been bad since early access
-End game isn't great at the moment (not enough variety in how to progress a character)
-Bosses will actively take less damage if your DPS is too high -> Game forces you to do mechanics even if you outright can destroy a boss in a few seconds
-Story isn't bad, but it's not great/memorable
-The lack of persistent zone mapping (what you uncovered) isn't great. The story mode maps are static as far as I can tell, so having a persistent map view would be awesome so that I don't have to backtrack (maps are reset upon zoning).

PRE 1.0

The mechanics per se are great. Guys who like it simple and just need leveling and loot are welcome here. Is it tough enough for hardcore gamers? - Dunno. But it has it's occasionally hard fights.

More often than not, the player is fighting the game design choices than the game.
It can be so rough around the edges... and I just don't mean QoL options only, but c'mon: to compare my off hand (2. ring) item with stuff in my backpack, I must change it into the main slot? Really?

And there are A LOT of those little, nerve-grinding things. Sure, you can play the game with them - a lot as you can see on my time. But being part sociopath, part masochist is easing the pain.
Did I mentioned tiny little ""holes"" in the map? You can 'see' them on the minimap, more or less, but on the 'real' map? Maybe a patch of grass, yeah. But your character get stuck and maybe you had to avoid the red sh*t on the ground.

1) No predatory monetization. What seems like a rarity nowadays, the cosmetics are so inconsequential to me that I don't feel compelled to spend at all. The price is also surprisingly low for the amount of content you get.

2) Great gameplay and design decisions, the respec being so accessible makes it easy to play without looking up builds in fear of messing up the character. It's neither too complex, nor too basic (like in D4 where it feels like just choosing between a few boring options).

3) Great artstyle, story and sound design. It's a joy to experience and you can see there was a lot of love put in. The story still isn't finished though from what I can see.

4) Offline gameplay option, another rarity nowadays, but much appreciated by me, especially considering the rocky launch it came in clutch. Concerning those issues, they seem solved for the most part now for me as I've been playing online without issues.

Server issues are much better, but load times are still inconsistent, sometimes taking half a minute to travel to a different area. Missing cosmetics have reappeared. Cosmetics are still not enabled for Singleplayer, honestly if they enabled it, I wouldn't even bother playing multiplayer considering that the game just feels better run solo due to high ping lag/region differences. 

Had to crank down graphics settings from Ultra to Very High, then from Very High to High. Framerate is now at 80 to 150 fps. I still think this is better than D4 when you don't account for the server issues. 

Edit: Cycle 1 (Season 1) doesn't seem to have any benefits? I should have made a new Legacy character to access my old gear, I didn't understand that until I've committed many hours into my new character. 

[h3]Updated Review for 1.0 Release[/h3]

Problems I mentioned below for my Early Access Review has yet to be addressed. Multiplayer is as janky as before, currently, it is worse than usual, taking minutes to load when travelling to a different area. Cosmetics are still unusable in singleplayer, with some cosmetics (purchased in early access) having disappeared. 

Graphics have been improved, at the cost of significant framerates. On a 3080ti 3440x1440 resolution, the framerate can fluctuate from 30-90 depending on what's happening on screen. Not unplayable, but unsatisfactory. 

Steer clear until these problems have been resolved. 

[h3]Review for Early Access[/h3]

First played on Jan 2022, came back December 2023 for the 0.9.2 update. Tried Diablo 4 in mid 2023 and was annoyed by the time the first season arrived, have not returned since. I restarted Last Epoch completely new in Dec 2023 and very much enjoyed the singleplayer experience again. Overall, this is a pretty good experience, especially since I got it at the original price which was lower (if I remember correctly). Apparently this is more complicated than Diablo 4 but simpler than Path of Exile, I am not sure as I have not played many ARPGs, also my Diablo 4 experience was easy from following online guides very closely (which you can do the same for Last Epoch).

However, I launched multiplayer and noticed the problems. The ""endgame"" or monolith farming is still as repetitive as ever. Having just unlocked empowered monolith on singleplayer (basically a repeat of the same maps and monsters just harder), this made my multiplayer experience even more monotonous. Connectivity is still an issue, I tried launching multiplayer earlier in 2023 but the lag was so horrible because they didn't have an Asia server yet. Presently, even with a 15ms delay to their Asia SE server, the connection can be janky at times. Have yet to try partying up with other players because they'd join my party and immediately leave due to regional server lag (300ms delay for someone in US/EU I think).

Overall, I'm still looking forward to better performances by 2024 1.0 release, I saw the graphical enhancement, hopefully the technical aspects are also improved. Hopefully they'll have a way to negate bot farmers (unlike Diablo 4) when they launch item trading.

Edit: Runemaster is still kinda broken as of Dec 2023, very easy to gear up frostclaw + frostbite stack, Snowdrift unique is very easy to acquire, highly recommend as an option for completely fresh start players.

Edit 2: Also, they disabled paid cosmetic items for singleplayer, which is really dumb, please enable, I hate online lag but I like cosmetic items",1701837230,1708853253,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I understand that you want to play instantaniously Then you can try and buy an AAA""A"" Game for 70 USD who have the bility to scale their server park with a couple click cause they have the funds, and you play your content on the first day, but even GTA 5 had BIG issues on their PC launch so it can happen... 

Aside from the extended loadtimes, which really did make the gam unplayable on the 1st and 2snd day, I have found no issue on the 3rd day.

TLDR;

Devs were not expecting so many players on launch day, so it went badly with loading screens all day, this is the reason of the greatly increased negativ reviews.

The gameplay in its self is great, combing the best elements of PoE and Diablo with extra (for free) contents coming in the future. 

Absolutely great value for the price had no issues of 3rd day of launch.

Fck You people, you are really spoiled. Better get some patience torwards  companies (especially indie / small companies)  who actually try and listen to you and admit their mistakes. 

I'd rather wait 3-4 extra days for a great game with a responsive dev team than play on day 1 and put it down after 50 hours, all that for 70 USD.

If you like ARPG, and you want to see something that is built players with smart solutions, buy it. I guarantee you wont regret it.

Story, classes, loot, crafting - everything is done the way I like it. It’s not boring to play, I feel the impact of my skills, for crafting you can always farm what you need, regardless of how strong you are. The scalability of endgame mechanics can be taken to infinity for any challenge that you come up with for yourself.
   At the time of release, the developers encountered server problems regarding multiplayer and transition between locations, and other things. Yes, this is bad, but many wanted to play with friends and enjoy finally a properly made ARPG. And the players’ indignation is quite understandable. Human time is precious and not everyone has enough time for games. But I stand by the fact that they are neither the first nor the last to face problems. If the game was bad, like [i]some others[/i], then the players' anger would be understandable, but here it is absolutely not true.

I have always felt that getting games when they are in Early Access as flipping a coin when they, if ever make it to an official launch.  Most games these days it almost seems that development teams and studios exploit EA access or have lost the good intentions that Project Greenlight was actually started for. 

Last Epoch for the most part have stayed true to their intentions of making a solid ARPG and in my opinion, did an excellent job of being in EA and being cautious and listening to feedback and trying to provide a new and unique take on the genre without letting go of what us top downers know and love. 

The game itself is not what I would consider ""The D4 Killer"" or ""The alternative to POE"" but more of a ""We sit in the middle"" game with a lot of content that is easy to understand that isn't trying to be either of the titles it's been given. 
While hype is hype, the game has come a long way from where it started and though you can't 'choose your race or gender' as that is somehow a negative to some for me it really reminds me of those old Dungeon Siege games with a bit more style and class. 

While in EA there weren't too many broken things to worry about, the main story needed work and of course, we all want MOAR stuff to fall on the ground, but overall coming into their launch day - the game for me was truly solid enough.

4 days after launch still a dumpster fire , devs providing no support or solutions. Servers are DC-ing, game is full of bugs, 10 min loading screens between zones are a normal occurence now, and if you even mention refunding on their discord you get timed out for 24 hours.

Well, first off, you can still play in offline mode and enjoy the game, Diablo 1-style. It's not terrible, whine more. 

So I gave it a couple days after launch before really trying to play. I experienced a couple minor server related issues, ultimately, smooth gameplay and a decent little story line. Oh, and mobs. <3

Tonight, I tried to log on with my online character again, as I have the last few nights. Online Play Unavailable.

I spent some time with my kids, ate some dinner - actually did my dishes, took the trash out. Came back after bed time, joined the Last Epoch Discord - Official Link in the Game Main Menu. Check the General Chat, see some guy yelling about everyone spamming General about Server issues saying, 'GO CHECK THE NEWS SECTION'

Went to News Section; ""We're currently in the middle of some back end deployments to address getting stuck at the character select screen. We expect it will only be down for a short period.""

I've had LE for over a year, saying I would play it more once Multiplayer came out. It did, and I have been playing it for quite a bit now. I enjoyed Grim Dawn, but something always felt off. Wolcen has good ideas, but the execution is a mess. Diablo IV is looking like just Diablo III with poorly thought out trees and core gameplay while having the worst itemization I've seen. Finally, Path of Exile is good, but if you haven't been playing consistently for awhile, you don't really feel like there's a goal to aim for and you just   

LE is scratching an itch I had no idea I had. Itemization is great, you can pick a mastery and mix the others to a point, the time jumping is much better Rifts, and it presents it within a nice package that all interconnects well under the hood. 

My only gripes are that I just want one more skill to spec into/put into the hotbar and have some way, without making a whole new character, to select a different mastery. One more skill slot would help round out so many builds (like the werebear druid). I, also, wouldn't care if it was a super rare drop for a hard quest/dungeon that I had to do for a mastery swap. Sometimes I just want to change things up without having to level another class.

Edit: I was right. D4 blows.

Edit 2-Dawn of the Third Day (of launch): Servers are a bit spotty, but I am thoroughly enjoying all on offer in the 1.0 state. Rolled a new class, got to a wall because my gear wasn't up to snuff. Went to do monoliths to get equipment. 9PM quickly turned into 5AM and I hated myself the next day, but I still love the game. 

EHG is still having a few server issues, but when I could play for that long, I didn't want to stop. I'm very happy for the success EHG are finding. They should be proud, because this is at least ten times better than D4 because it sticks to its roots and expanded instead of whatever the hell Blizzard is doing. I hope they continue to give this game love for many years to come, as I will probably be here for all of it.

They can't get their servers to work since release. You can definitely play offline, in that case the game is not worth it's cost.

The gameplay side of the game might be complete and pretty nice but the server side of the things definitely are not. The servers don't work, the devs can't get them to work. The game was not ready to be released.

It was hard to play before release because of bugs related to zone changing. For example, I had crush on changing virtual desktops (ctrl + win + right arrow) while loading new zone. I had game crush loading gamezone and taking screenshot via ShareX (game crushed and ShareX crushed with ""out of memory"" exception).

But after release the time needed to change zone also increased. As a software developer myself, I'm not able to figure out how is it possible, that game zone loading is connected to servers bandwidth and I don't want to know either, to be honest.

Another damn thing is that in-game buttons are reacting to ""mouse hover""-event when there is another app, opened in front of Last Epoch, i.e., browser or telegram desktop app.
I chose to play at a time of lower online, but I've got another 3 crushes in a row trying to simply change the location: loaded location was fully black, only game interface was visible, and on entering previous location I had crushes. These were the last straws of my patience.

Not gonna describe in detail my experience with chosen class or progress system or levels design etc because problems, provided above, neutralize small amount of positive thoughts about this piece of garbage.

-----------------------------------
Inspired by Diablo II and Grim Dawn.
A well done combination that feels like a solid Arpg.

Classes are fun, story is great, lore is awesome.
A must play Argp for sure, Last Epoch does what i want in a game from this genre.

The graphics are solid, music has some fantastic tracks, level design is great and feels like a true Arpg.
Last Epoch is probably one of the best Arpg's made. not the best, but sure as hell is a great time.

The game can be played offline with no connection required or online.
Offline works perfectly and is the place i have played 90% of my time with the game.
Online had some issues on launch and still can have some hick ups.
Keep in mind their player numbers skyrocketed over a few days hitting 200k+ players.
I hope they will get their server issues in order !

Last Epoch is a fantasticly well made game. Created with a passion, from fans of this genre.
And it shows.

Story design - the story is so bad ,there isn't anything memorable ,unlike with other competitors. 

The campaign is one ""boss"" after another ""boss"", who do not say anything and your character is almost mute. Where is the fun in that?

 Yes ,its an ARPG ,but when I play PoE ,I get to hear ""By the GOlden Arse of Innosence"" or Piety begging for help or Malachai going off the rails. And then Izaro going hard with his lines. 

Each act there is full of NPC's and overall story, meanwhile in Last Epoch ,you talk with 1 npc for main quest and 1 npc for side quest each zone. 
AMAZING right ?

I don't feel my character is awesome at all or accomplishing impossible things.

Game design - if they implement ""Loadouts"" it would be great ,but currently switching talents and skills is really annoying. 

Combat is fun ,but the minimum point system is complete ass - you level some skills ,you decide you want to try other things and then you have to relevel if you go back to your old skills. Same thing with respeccing points, you actually delevel the skill ,so you have to level up the skill while still using it . Wut?

Level design - the zones you go throught while leveling are LONG and not intuitive in which direction you should go - yes there are quest markers ,but at some points I was just hoping I do not reach a dead end and backtrack.

There are dungeons while leveling ,but no Dungeon keys drop ? Are they for your 2nd character and so on? I wanted to try these Dungeons, no key so far at act 8.
As for crafting , I do not understand why the  crafting materials - shards (which do no stack) you pick are not transfered directly, maybe technical reason, but you have to use a button for it. Its a minor QoL problem.

In short, combat is polished and feels ok( so far ) ,but thats it. 
I do not recommend this game right now / patch 1.0 /
 Maybe in a year or two, it will be more fun.

Played an ability-heavy class and a right-click class. And there's just...something missing. Maybe it's because you can fine-tune your drop filter so accurately that drops become so rare you're not even interested in them anymore. Maybe it's because your build is set in stone at such an early stage of the game that all you're really doing is exploring the world and looking for upgrades of your already set gear. Or maybe it's because forging allows you to completely ignore the loot drop aspect completely and just break down everything to then turn whites into your favorite gear anyways? Could also be that the story just isn't doing any favors, with the epoch being this magically perfect device that can cure cancer AND bring the best orgasms in town AND save humanity from bad politics.

But most probably it's just all of this combined... I really wanna like this game. The little lore-drops are cool and give a view into the interesting lives of the individuals in this fantasy world. The skill system is big and diverse, so there's plenty of builds to make. The early maps look astonishing and beautiful. And from what I've seen there's lots of interesting end-game content to run. But playing the game in itself is just not fun. Walking through the hordes and hordes of cookie-cutter monsters but with different models and themes is just not fun. Even the bosses have only been remotely interesting and that should be the part where the game shines.

I find myself just teleporting through the areas, looking for the next interesting thing to catch me off guard. Maybe a secret? Maybe a puzzle? A boss fight with an interesting mechanic?

Revised:
Slowly getting some stability but I think that is worse. You get into anything like an echo (dungeon) and that is when a disconnect happens and you lose your progress.

Still lots of bugs. Quest/echos sometimes don't reward what they are supposed to. You interact with vendors to buy something and you end up with something else because their screen is off by a bit.

Theres something off about the visual style that feels weirdly lifeless, stiff and also not clear enough for me to orientate myself smoothly in action. It reminds me of the same feel that Ashes of Singularity had, which is not good for action RPG.

Second negative - controls - again they feel off - for example I cant have one ability combined with move on left click, which im used to so much and I consider this basic functionality.
 
Third nail in the coffin for me is gender lock of characters. I would very much so play male Rogue, but I cant - I knew about this one and I tried to give game a chance regardless. And I would get through it, if the feel and controls were good like in PoE for example, but theyre not.

Combined together I just cant enjoy this one, breaks my immersion, makes me sad, I really wanted to immerse myself into this one. Maybe some other time. I wish EHG the best, will give them a year or two to improve it and check on LE later.

I've clocked in 400 hours, mostly in early release. I like it then.
With the new graphics and better combat it feels great.
It doesn't have the compelling story D4 does -but it does do AARPG way better. Skills in this game is amazing, and build diversity unlimited.

Diablo 4 had a great story but lacked any meaningful endgame whereas Path of Exiles story is nothing to write home about but has an incredibly vast endgame. Last Epoch in its current form is mediocre at both and even with all the different builds and ways to change how skills function, if the actual sandbox to use those skills in is lacking, I don't see a reason to play. 

I hope the devs go back to the drawing board and re imagine their endgame because it's currently the equivalent of speed running white maps in Path of Exile. The story is also an incoherent mess and you can tell certain parts of it are multiple years old at this point. I personally don't care as long as you can beat it in a reasonable amount of time and can spend a majority of your characters playtime in the endgame.

There's also performance issues once you get to the endgame with pretty bad frame drops depending on your build and a 1 second lag spike when you pick up a bunch of runes/fragments.

I haven't played this game during early access, but the sheer amount of bugs (not just limited to server bugs) make it feel like it's still an early access game. Could the community be more patient and supportive? Sure. But when you launch without any discount after five years of early access, that in itself comes as a strong proclamation that you are ready to deliver the quality. And you simply didn't.

Leaving aside these issues, I feel that the graphics are really nice and the storytelling isn't as bad as many people say it is. In fact, I found it quite engaging as compared to many ARPGs out there. The soundtrack isn't very memorable but it fits into the game well enough. 

One thing that did break engagement for me was the lack of ANY challenge early on. Fights are relatively easy, and death has no penalty; you just revive right there after 3 seconds with no exp loss whatsover. Many players say it changes later on when they unlock monoliths in the endgame, but I don't wanna blitz through 20-30 hours of 'story-mode', devoid of any survival aspect, just to get there. Unlike server issues, this is not a bug. It's just terrible design decision from my perspective.

Beyond the launch issues, Last Epoch is one of the best thought-out iterations in it's genre in a long time. Playing it, you can see where the devs took inspiration from Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, and Diablo 2.

Some of my favorite things:

* Character building is deep and complex without being too dense for new players
* Every character has multiple viable build paths (even within each mastery class) allowing you to play what you like without having to slave yourself to one build guide
* Item crafting is easy to pick up and has less RNG than some other games (*cough* Path)
* Combat is fast paced without being frantic and rewards you for learning the tempo of your moves rather than button mashing
* The graphics look great, and there is a good variety of map designs and enemy designs
* Endgame play is fun and feels like it should have good lasting power
* Necromancers are actually good

Some things I don't love:
* The cut scenes are exceedingly meh, as is the character dialogue
* The sound design could do more to contribute to the game's atmosphere

TLDR: If you like ARPGs, this game is absolutely worth your time and money. If you can't stand server lag, wait a couple weeks after launch to let the devs work out the last of the kinks.

You could do anything you wanted, no meta's, no gates, play as you please.  That has been completely wiped out, and i mean worse than d4. You will have a blast until level 80, then good luck to you. If you dont play a massive defense build/character type ) i/e tank) your in for a rough time. You either tolerate repeatedly being anhilated or go do subpar content way below your level and hope you get gear that can carry you. Every map mod just say more damage, and a lot of characters now have almost no defense. Armor is manditory, but only the tanks get enough of it. Certain builds on some classes will get you through somewhat, but you must take skills that will take you there. Forget pets completely now, they will never make it. Basically look on le tools and find a build doing atleast c200 maps or you will regret it, and no one on there is posting these. There is gear that you need c200 to gewt, not much, but still...  .7 c 500 was a goal, now its gl on c100 with out going meta. sounds like D4 anyone?

 Sad face, another game that has a fail on launch.

And these devs nerfed everything again, why pray tell why? It has been so fun leveling and playing with stuff and then you hit endgame and wham, nerf galore. The biggest is now corrupted maps have defense buffs with mob dps buffs and then to start 50% more dps and def to mobs at minimal. What are these developers of late thinking, no one wants to go from perfectly fine to one shotted with amazing defenses. I mean 56% armor, max resistances, 100% crit avoidance, 60% endurance and 500 end threshold just to start and still they hit for 10k without a crit, theres no point in playing until they get their act together. Maybe they hired blizzard devs, who knows.

Came back after a year and this game is even more solid now. Dev's actually listen to the player base, they improved all aspects of the game and seem to undone all the nerfs they started to do back then. End game is revamped and is awesome, i have 0 complaints for a beta game, it feels almost good to go for release. Now if only other game developers would follow suit with last epoch (cough, blizzard, cough)



Now into 7.10 patches the game feel and playability has returned. Very fun, and extensive skill lists make for an almost never ending combination of builds. End game farming is renewed with crafting and unique combinations that make the game fun to repeat farming monolith of fate. Hopefulyy the game keeps going fdown this path of hard choices between excellent crafting pieces and uniques that add diversity to the builds.


6 patches after 7.7 the game is still bugged to all hell. It was perfect before and now they are slowly unnerfing everything nerfed and nerfing  everything people changed to after the massive nerf bat. What a sad sad thing. A great game destroyed. I don’t who they hired, but they need to be fired immediately. 

They finally did what every game developer seems bound to do, ninja nerfs galore. The game was awesome at its previous state to 7.7 and now is nerfed into crud!

While still in alpha, Lost Epoch offers decent game play so far  I say so far because of the extreme diversity of characters leaves me still a newbie in all of them (level 27 highest). It plays like a mesh of d2+d3 with aspects of a ton of different, popular, successful games (PoE,Grim Dawn,Rifts Everquest 1, and a few others. Sounds impossible that someone would be smart enough to try to incorporate popular aspects of all these games but so far the devs are doing a decent job. There are still many bugs, but this is alpha. If you love these kind of games, eventually you will regret not getting this one, especially when they put it on sale. Now keep reading for explicit game details.

There are 4 characters who will all eventually morph into a choice of 3 more ArcheTypes. For instance, the mage morphs into a lich, or a necro and will have another class to choose from once it is finished in development. I believe only 2 archetypes are missing total, dont hold me to it.

Each base class has a set of skills that unlock with levels and you also get passive points when you level that are used on Passive trees for the character and each arch type has its own tree as well. As you spend points you unlock skills in the trees as well.

Skills can level also, proving points to placed in the skills own passive tree that enhances and or changes its playstyle.

Respecs are available.

So far every stat has clear and concise information of what it does and how it effects you. This is the best part so far, clear information on whats happening.

Loot drops are adequate and Unique's seem to drop after 15.

Unique's are nice, but they are bugged atm.

There are 4 maps with travel nodes offering various enemies from different times and eras and you seem to be hunting for missing relics of the past. Time Portals (similar to rifts) and transport you to a fun mini mission to find the exit and escape. The Boss drops the missing relic.

Fights are real easy at first, trash white mobs, then there are blue elite packs, yellow champions and i believe orange/red bosses. Identifying them is tricky as so far you have to target them to id them (EQ1) and the information is basic. Engage at own risk. Like i said, at first the fighting seems too easy. then you die. then you go back find out there was a champion you didn't recognize. I love this. Nothing has been brokenly op or anything, but this allows for great opportunity. Making CC viable again as you would have to stop and target groups if you havn't memorized the mobs yet, and even better if you have as the cc can now just target the main threats. This also complicates rushing, adding a better challenge to someone who is geared above the content.

And finally the game has gambling! About time devs remembered to put in a cash sink at a fair rate.

Despite only ten hours, and only scraping the tip of the iceberg in this ""Path of Exile meets Chrono Trigger"" time traveling expedition I think I have to caution this isn't for everyone. While the online servers are 50/50, you do not need to play online so people who hate interaction in any form are going to fit just fine with this ARPG experience.

Story: The story is interesting, but nothing special. Events shape the world, you get these shards of the epoch... you drift to the end of the world and build an epoch to go back in time and change the course of history. I mean you hit M and see your map in 4 periods of time... I figured all this out in 5m, I don't need to have the game tell you any of this. ""I never looked at my map..."" How do you even play ARPG's?

Gameplay: If you haven't played an ARPG since Diablo 2, Last Epoch is essentially a compilation of the last 20 years of developments in ARPGs. 5 classes, each class has 1 of 3 specializations. You get the great, and you get the bad. You can respec easily except your chosen elite specialization and you can focus on particular skills to complement a build. You can find items with basic stats, and then you can craft additional stats or take a chance to remove affixes by shattering an item to put onto something you already own. This is pretty much a simpler Path of Exile item/skill system. No gems or funky bloat here, just ""what you see is what you get"" You can focus on up to 5 skills to boost their effectiveness, sometimes with tradeoffs and some are just improvements. All is good, except the maps (even in offline mode) seem to love respawning so if you go ""My inventory is full, I need to sell"" in the wrong spot, enjoy reclearing an entire map to get where you really wanted to be.

Sound and Graphics: Game looks good on my 1650 Super and 3600. I get a steady 100FPS except the first skill usages of a session seem to have an initial spike. Characters change armor as you get new equipment, but those of you wanting ""create a character"" will not get that here. Music is great, but even boosted to 100% is still on the quiet side of default settings. I want to buy the soundtrack, but I can't even hear it in game so I'm not going to buy it... sorry.

TLDR: So I think if you haven't played an ARPG in 20 years, this is a good window into what you missed. IF you hate ARPG's, skip this game. IF you want a simplified Path of Exile, buy this game. I'm not going to comment on online servers outside of the fact this is week one of the game, and when you underestimate demand you get issues that will be worked out... so the fact the entire game can be played OFFLINE (and most of you will probably not be playing with friends anyways, you love spreadsheets and bigger numbers means bigger better damage.) means that the game can be reviewed as is. The game is complex, but nothing makes you scratch your head... except Negative mana... what the heck is negative mana? The game guide has nothing about negative mana... so I give this game negative mana out of a good time? I mean 7.2/10, its not a bad game... but it caters to one audience really well and misses a chance to cater to a casual audience.",1708837902,1708837902,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unlike some other arpgs, it gives the appropriate balance of being casual-friendly yet offering enough depth in its skill trees, build opportunities with classes, crafting, loot, etc. I have yet to fully explore the entirety of the end game and all the builds and items available, but I have not felt this good about playing an arpg since the days of Diablo 2 (I spent many thousands of hours on that game). So far, no other arpg has come even close to me. I played Diablo 3 on and off for 10 years (about 1000 hours), Diablo 4 (about 250 hours), Grim Dawn (150 hours), and PoE (about 70). Admittedly, PoE is the most unique in that it is excessively complex and ultimately not for me who is much more of a casual. I hated the fact that I felt pigeon-holed into looking up build guides and could not spend the time to figure out the game myself. Last Epoch is a game that I can enjoy and figure out on my own, which provides me a great sense of satisfaction knowing that I can and will figure out my own builds without the need for the help or guidance of others. I have tried out every class and a single mastery thus far, and I was genuinely surprised that every single class felt GOOD to play. I'm going to play this game a LOT. 

If any of what I have said resonates with you, give this game a try. For $35 you will not have to spend a penny more for every bit of content they will release in the future for this game.

That's about it though, the world and monsters look like peak unity_store_assetpack_01, there's practically 0 world building or atmosphere, resulting in an experience that's just 50 different bland corridors, seperated by an odd mobile game-esque world map.
Can't say it doesn't do anything original, as resetting a zone if you leave it for any reason is a first and utterly incomprehensible, serving no other reason aside from just massively inconveniencing the player.
There's no real story to speak of, being more brief than most mobile games, mainly just exists to point you into the next corridor.

Pros: 

Gameplay is awesome. Great for people that enjoy a variety of playstyles. You can play as your generic warrior class/mage, but the subclasses are where the game 'pops off', where you can go and fixate yourself on a very specific way of playing said subclasses. For example, you can turn your lightning strike melee skill into a totem that becomes a spell if you'd like. 

Carrying on from there, if you enjoy 'lazy' playstyles, like minions, totems, ballistas, then this game has you covered. Diablo IV and PoE nerfed those playstyles for the sake of 'vision', but this game lets you play how you want.

The game has a decent-ish endgame. You either like it or you don't. They have their version of maps/rifts, and it comes in the way of monoliths, which are way faster than maps/rifts, and you are able to target farm items through them. 

The game also has an awesome developer that cares a lot about the community, however, just as good as they are to show good intent, they have developed a protective shell of criticism that will get defended by the cult-like fanbase regardless of how kind your feedback may come across. 

Game looks quite nice, the maps are very detailed and with everything cranked up and an OLED monitor it looks beautiful. People telling you that the game looks bad are playing on potatoes with potato settings.

Now onto the cons....

Cons: 

Game has so much jank its ridiculous. There are boss encounters that don't work. There are graphical issues/not being able to complete quests because you didn't complete them in a certain way.

Let me give you an example: my druid is a spriggan form druid and during boss encounters he will stay in his human form despite being transformed. I will then lay down my totems (which should be visible) and they will not be able to be seen, same goes for the bosses' tentacles, can't see them. 

There are many many more issues with your typical unpolished jank, but I don't feel like going into great detail over everything as it will probably be longer than the 'pros' section, but on the whole it has a lot of jank that has existed for YEARS, and has not been fixed yet, literal forum posts of people reporting bugs from as far back as 2019 that haven't been fixed. 

I am willing to bet a million dollars that there is not a single player that has played this game during its 'grand release' that just happened a few days ago that hasn't encountered bugs that have existed/have been commented on for literal YEARS.

And you want to know why? The community blindly defends them regardless of what they do, there is stockholm syndrome that exists and if you criticize the game (even in a constructive way), you'll be met with people arguing with you, which leads to the developers not actually fixing real issues.

Usually such server issues would be an issue for Arpgs like this one but the launch of an offline mode (that worked perfectly well the minute of release) and the lack of racing based events/leaderboards (8-16 hours of lost gameplay time meaning very little compared thousands of hours the ""launch league"" leaderboards will be active to record character lvl and waves completed) to the alleviates such concerns. 

The game itself is a fun change of pace from PoE. The classes (through passive trees and skill trees) are detailed enough to create unique build while playing without needing 3rd party tools and ahead of time planning. The crafting is intuitive, easy to jump into, and well-encouraged/rewarded. The end game content, while not as detailed as PoE, is in a great place for a game launch and will provide well enough enjoyable playtime to be worth the price tag.

If you are playing solo, you can play offline and explore a bit as online isn't really required unless you want to play with friends. The only thing lacking would be an offline p2p mode where you and friends get to play without going online similar to lan parties.

Current experience,
Day 1 (Launch) - Can create an online character but couldn't enter the game, played offline.
Day 2 - Started playing my character in online, loading to another zone took a while and needed some retries (moving away from the transition zone and returning).
Day 3 - Continued character in online, loading was shorter now.

1) Last Epoch team did a very good job designing spell trees and classes/mastery classes.
I had a blast making my build, trying different spells and unlocking new synergies and game styles. My warlock went from a DOT based build, to a curse/burst build stacking damned/affliction/witchfire. It was so refreshing not knowing what to do and figure it out. Felt very rewarding. As a GGG/POE fan, Last Epoch nailed it.

2) I really like the 'Idol' system in the game, it is really well done (sort of D2 charms with a twist).

3) The campaign was good. I am now enjoying Monolith and other End-Game content. I am blown away. Finally a team that was able to get inspired by POE mapping/Atlas and do their own thing... Monolith is very good and fun. Factions are interesting too. I also tried an Arena run because a prophecy sent me there. I had fun doing it (rogue like content risk vs reward sort of thing).

4) I cannot talk much about crafting yet but so far it is positive. Different than POE, probably better.

5) I found a bunch of uniques, was able to use some during the campaign. I got lucky with a few set items as well, prophecies and Monolith helped.  

Overall, I am impressed and I can see myself playing this game for a while. Last Epoch took good ideas from others games but also implemented successfully new mechanics and were not afraid to be creative! 
Thank you to all the alpha/beta testers and the Last Epoch team making a great game and putting AAA studios to shame. We finally got a good RPG, a great successor to POE, while we wait for POE2.

However, now 4 days into the full release and I have yet to be able to actually play the game for any meaningful amount of time due to the seemingly endless server stability issues. At best you can play for an hour or 2 before getting stuck in a never-ending loading screen and have to crash the game and try again later. At worst, you'll never make it into the game at all.

I have now uninstalled and reinstalled, deleted all local files and verified the files twice and still no joy.

Pretty much every online ARPG thats released has had similar levels of issues during launch, it should really just be expected at a certain point, and while not ideal it really isnt a huge deal in the long run.
My review will be for the ACTUAL GAME not the servers, because their current issues are temporary and not the game itself.

The story of this game is fairly generic, but ARPGs are well known for having just okay stories as an excuse for the gameplay. This game succeeds in making satisfying gameplay the core of the game, with high levels of customization. The skills are easy to respec, allowing a lot of build variability and customization even with two players playing the same base class with the same sub class. Most of the skills interact with one or multiple other skills, and each skills own skill tree has multiple major modifiers for the skill, allowing a ton of variability and replayability.
The game has enough min maxing that if youre the kind of player that enjoys looking up ideal builds you'll likely enjoy it, and just enough freedom that if you prefer trying things and theory crafting for yourself like I do you'll also very likely enjoy it. Striking that balance without overwhelming players is tough, and frankly they nailed it in this one.

The main story gameplay is just easy enough to sort of breeze through as long as you pay some attention, allowing you to really experiment during it to decide what build you'd like to make. The end game content is just hard and just varied enough to allow you to fine tune your build, as well as having interesting loot thats near exclusive to end game meaning that you're truly encouraged to play the end game stuff and not just drop the game once the campaign ends.
Issues definitely exist in the game, but there is a good reason why this game has stayed well above 50% positive even with major issues with the servers on their 1.0 release and the positive reviews continue to climb while the negative reviews have gotten less and less.

While not perfect, this is absolutely the kind of direction I want devs and ARPG games to go: lots of open communication from the devs, fun and fulfilling gameplay, lots of variety and customization, ability to play online or offline, and just enough depth of end game to keep players coming back without being overwhelming or too grindy. Giving this game a bad review based on temporary issues with servers is a knee jerk reaction and not actually based on the game itself",1708833022,1708833022,True,1,0,0.515625,0,True,False,False

The graphics are gorgeous, and LOOKING at gameplay, it seems amazing!
But you come to realize VERY quickly, that it LOOKING fun and it BEING fun are 2 seperate ideas.
The default control scheme was created by someone without hands. It IS rebindable, sure, most of it, but the main issue being your main attack key. You don't hold down shift and click to main attack, you RIGHT CLICK. You don't open your bag with B, Instead using the I key. I nearly started using a controller just because it feels less weird, but that was quickly ruined, too, as instead of using the right stick to do your main attack, you simply hold the right trigger, and HOPE LIKE HELL that you were pointing at the bad guy, and that you don't need to make an escape anytime soon.
Shift-click works for main attack, regardless of being two button presses, because moving after an attack is essential in many cases, and having to switch between left and right clicking rapidly is much more confusing for most than simply tapping and letting go of shift. It just... Feels weird.
I really, REALLY want to get on them about barely having ragdoll physics in an ARPG, limiting it only to humanoid enemies, those enemies just slowly dropping to the ground like CS:GO characters before the CS2 update... but I feel that's a bit nitpicky, especially when your average ARPG fan is fine with it, the main ""you should totally play this!"" game being touted being a game where characters just fall to the ground the same exact way every time they die, and they're fine with that.",1708832006,1708832513,False,4,0,0.429042905569076538,0,True,False,False

Online is playable and only problem with matchmaking is queuing into different regions which can take 10 minutes. They do have an offline mode which sadly is a different save and has no online cosmetic micro-transactions which I will add are heavily over priced but they are mostly to support the game anyway.

TLDR: Game is good, server issues aside. Play in offline mode and wait for a fix. As this is a smaller studio working on this game they may not have been prepared for the influx of players on their server infrastructure. Wait for a fix and shut up you blubbering sacks of waste. 

As my standards for games has been lowered by AAA studios over the past 5-7 years I have ventured towards ""indie"" studios as a form of silent rebellion of said AAA studios. As I have played the game sense its early access was a thing I have watched the game grow over its development. (unlike other unfortunate investments I have made in more recent past...BLIZZARD) 
Last Epoch fits into the category of how an indie studio can accomplish what a AAA cannot. Drawing comparisons to the Diablo franchise as well as PoE is natural and all in all this game is a good middle ground between the two. 
It has a less complex trait/skill tree compared to PoE but more complex then D4 (by a LANDSLIDE) 
The loot systems are similar, different rarities of items, unique items that do fun and funky things (like bees) and they dont look terrible! (looking at you D4) 
The crafting system really just focuses on adding/changing/removing passive benefits items you find throughout the world can give you, not crafting new items entirely. 
There is a micro transaction shop in the game much more like PoE. (As of now it is more of an afterthought and not a MAJOR presence in the game...like D4) As of now it focuses on in game pets that don't do anything other then look cute, portal/armor skins and mounts. It seems that the dev team are planning on adding ability skins like how PoE has as well. (At the time of this review there is nothing of the sort in the shop) 

As someone who skips through story because I have no hope for writing in video games anymore I have no idea what the story is about or if its good. I just like that I can skip it and carry on killing my enemies with their great great great grandmas reanimated skeleton. 
Side quest are a thing, again I just do them and skip the why because I don't care *why* you need me to kill this thing just give me my EXP and leave me to it. 
The game-play is best described as ""I can turn my brain off and not think until either I, or a skill levels up."" It serves its function and it dose a great job of doing that. I can closely tie it to more D3 than anything: Move to the quest marker, as you do so, kill this mob with one or two rotations of your skills or smack them with your primary ability over and over, kill the boss, loot and repeat. 

The art style is pleasant not the prettiest environments or characters but its something you can stare at for at least 4 hours a day. The most common complaint I hear is that it is *dated looking.*  When looking at D3 or PoE in comparison it looks on par or better then them. But I will hand it to Blizzard D4s environment is bounds better. That being said graphics don't define a games worth or the enjoyment that it provides. I enjoy playing games like Fallout 3 or OG Doom and they are EXTREMELY dated in terms of graphics. This however doesnt diminish the enjoyment I experience when playing them.
Multiplayer is,,, there.... I have to say the one other thing Blizzard gets right (at least with D3) is the multiplayer aspect of their games. Last Epoch (and to an extent PoE) has an interesting multiplayer function. In order to play multiplayer you have to play the game in online mode and for the most part its functions, if a little jank. Kicking party members doesn't always work, when you move between maps the game can get stuck in with long loading times but other then that its decent. 
After ALL that I do have to point out the HUGE problem the game has right now, and that is the strenuous server issues. Unlike D4 there IS an offline mode, though the characters you make in offline mode are stuck in offline forever. If you have no internet or there are server issues and you want to play your main, tough luck. Create a new character or wait for better connectivity. There is no LAN feature to play with friends offline, which is unfortunate. 
As of right now the Devs are hard at work trying to get the servers to function with the load that is put under them with this launch. From an outside perspective I think the devs weren't expecting the amount of interest that the game has garnered, especially from D4 players that are mad at Blizzard and the PoE players that want a break from the franchise before PoE2 comes out. With that being said the devs have said time and time again that the issues are fixed when they aren't, garnering mistrust and anger from said D4/PoE fans. In time the issues will be fixed. As I want to play this game with my fiance I have no drive to play in offline mode and await for a more permanent fix to me made on the servers before I play further. 
If the server issues are a problem wait to buy the game (unlike me), or buy the game and play in offline mode and wait like me.",1708829588,1708829588,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You like a skill? Just build arround it by looking at the tags (Int-Zone-Fire-Spell) on the skill icon. The craft is the best of every HnS (including PoE). Items and their mods/rolls are great and can modify your skills and synergy. The campaign is correct, I mean, it's better than PoE but not deep as a Diablo. The end game is really good, below PoE, but still very good.

You buy the game, and that's it. You buy extra tab stash with in-game gold. Every class is fun, to be honest, I want to make 2-3 builds for the 15 mastery. This game is more simple than PoE, but still deep. It's between Diablo and Path of Exile, but closer to PoE than Diablo 4.

Comparing the two, I'd say that PoE is still my favourite ARPG, but Last Epoch is a close second on that all-time list. Launch-weekend server issues aside, it's well worth its asking price, especially if you enjoy playing solo and/or offline, which I do. If you're a big fan of online play, though, or wanting to play with friends, and you're reading this during the launch window, be sure to check Eleventh Hour Games' Discord or Forum for updates on the server situation - they've managed to attract far more interest than they were expecting, and the servers do have some of the same early growing pains that we've seen from other wildly successful online indie games recently.

A few other thoughts:

* Offline play really is a big plus - it's nice to see both offline and online options in the same game, something that seems to have mostly gone out of fashion. If a game can be played solo, and comes with a purchase price, then I consider an offline option to be a basic requirement, and I'm glad that EHG agreed.

* The campaign is OK, although there are points where objectives are not clearly communicated, which can be a little frustrating/boring for a bit. For players who are wanting to level different characters, rather than just respeccing, my pro tip is to save those dungeon keys, since there are alternate/shorter levelling paths available which require them.

* Visuals and animations all received significant upgrades just before launch, and it shows - the game looks great, and moment-to-moment gameplay feels good. The pace might feel slow to someone who's used to the crazy pace of PoE, but it never felt too slow - monster density feels like its well dialled in, and difficulty feels well-balanced, at least for the Classes/Masteries that I've played so far.

* Itemisation is solid, and I'd say on par with other top-notch item systems in the genre. Crafting, however, is absolutely top shelf, and may be one of the most interesting and engaging crafting systems I've ever seen in an ARPG, even compared to other games with excellent crafting options like PoE and Grim Dawn. No doubt about it, EHG have raised the bar for ARPG crafting systems.

* I haven't spent any time with it yet, but from what I've seen the end game looks serviceable - it's obviously not at the level of PoE's, but I wasn't expecting it to be. We'll see how EHG develops their game's endgame over time, but for now, I expect most of LE's replayability to come from exploring the build options afforded by the game's fifteen masteries.

* The trade system, by contrast, looks to be significantly better than PoE's - EHG may have set a new standard for ARPG trade systems. It's still early days, and I'm waiting to see how things really shake out there before passing judgement, but things look promising on this front.

I do have a couple of very minor quibbles with the user interface, like the way that clicking on a waypoint doesn't just transport you to the location: instead, LE wants you to notice and click the ""travel"" button.It's only one extra mouse click, but it's a thing that you have to do all the time, so it adds up, and it's annoying every time it happens. I can understand wanting a confirmation step on an action which will alter an item, or destroy an item, or spend some other resource, but these are just waypoints. Why else would I be clicking them except to go there? 

The UI has a few of these tiny pain points, extra mouse clicks for common actions, with no obvious reason, and no option to modify the behaviour,. Again, its a tiny annoyance, but I do hope they tidy up these little details. Another quibble: why is the cosmetics menu greyed out in offline mode? I'm playing offline, in part because the servers are borked; why can't I engage with this system? Assuming I wanted to give EHG more money here, this is an active disincentive to doing so. It doesn't even make business sense.

Still, overall, I'm having a great time, and I heartily recommend this one. 8 out of 10.",1708749270,1708828597,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It provides you with resources and quality of life features like no other ARPG. Features are introduced with pleasant pacing and instruction. This is a game you can pick up, play and finish without having to follow a guide or use external software, and I think it thoroughly rewards you for doing so.

Say what you will about the launch, but the game was fine before launch, give it time and it will be so again post launch. The developers have proven themselves both trustworthy, hardworking and kind humans. No launch will ever be perfect, and surely we've endured worse launches than this.
No launch will ever be perfect, because that's the very nature of large-scale releases, there's so many issues that cannot be detected no matter how long betas are, nor how many server stress tests are performed. 
There are issues that only arise in a real-world launch scenario. 

Every large-scale launch is bad, we've just mostly clouded our memory of them with all the fun we had afterwards.
Just relax, play something else while you wait, or hop on offline mode which they've graciously included.

The story is pretty good and you can get though it in a day or 2 if youre familiar with arpgs.  If what you are looking for is a solid game of hack, slash, and loot then dont hesitate.  Its fun.  

Its not as difficult as Path of Exile.  You can build a character however you want.  If your build isnt working out like you wanted.  No problem.  Unlike PoE respecing isnt a punishment.  The builds arent as diverse as PoE.  However, one could argue that PoE just has lots of choices but most of them dont lead to a good build.  In Last Epoch there are very few ways to end up with a build that isnt viable all the way though the story.  

Gearing is easy through the story mode also.  By the time you get to the end you will know what works with your character and what doesn't.  Everything in the skills is easy to understand and tells you clearly what it scales with so you know what to look for.  There are indeed nuances and more advanced ideas to consider at the end game.  But its not overwhelming.  Once the story is over you can start target farming the items you want and probably wont have to make it a second job to find good items for your character either.  

Last Epoch feel like a cross between Path of Exile and Grim Dawn.  It doesn't try to be either one though.  It's has its own unique feel.   Personally I think Grim Dawn is a better overall arpg.  Much more content and customization.  But these are early days for Last Epoch and there will be more content arriving.  In time it could become another classic arpg.  

Id give this game a solid 7.5 / 10.  It's good.  It doesn't cost $70.  No loot boxes.  No season passes.  Fun game with a good game loop.  Developers are responsive and appear committed to supporting this title for a long time.   Could use a bit more content post story.

... because of a few loud and ultra-negative people.

I still saw way more love for the game than negative reviews though, so I decided to visit their Discord to ask people what the situation is.

After hearing from actual players, it became apparent that most other people I speak to have zero issues with the game. I've spoken to people who have 100+ hours online and had only 2 disconnects for example (which is in huge contrast to some negative people claiming they disconnect every hour).

So, after seeing the community's enthusiasm, I decided to buy the game despite my fears, and was ready to refund it if needed. But as I kept approaching the 2 hour mark, I was too hooked. I already knew: I want this game. This game is something special...

The fact that I am writing this review is huge. I almost never review any games.

This game is actually extremely good. The world was a bit ""boring"" in the first hour, when I was in the plain landscape and didn't have many skills, but it quickly evolved after that and hooked me around the 2 hour mark. The graphics are really beautiful (when you get past the ""plain, normal world"" intro area), the sound effects are fantastic, the skill trees and classes and depth are brilliant.

I can see why there's a huge cult around it. The creator is just a nerd like us, and he wants to make the ultimate ARPG for himself. This game is not driven by the apathy and greed of typical ""big business"" game companies. Just watch his development streams and various interviews. Mike is one of us, and he's a great guy.

Everything in this game's design respects you, the player. It's not a soul-less, corporate money sucker like most other ARPGs.

Even the pre-order bonus is pro-customer: The only thing you get by pre-ordering is a small Guppy pet, which is available in every edition of the game (even base edition). All other deluxe/ultimate items will remain available after launch too. And guess what? If you decide that you want any of the cosmetics of the more expensive editions, you can buy the upgrade to those cosmetics for the exact price difference. If this was any other company, they would have used ""FOMO"" (fear of missing out) to guilt you into the more expensive editions immediately.

In fact, this game will never sell any powerful items. Only skins. And the game already gives you beautiful skins just by playing it and finding items, so you don't need to buy any skins at all.

The game will also never have any paid DLC expansions. All world expansions will be completely free.

What a refreshing game developer!

Every game mechanic is also a labor of love, and are meticulously designed. There is so much innovation in this game that it's kind of blowing my mind how good it is.

Inventory tetris, wasting 1 hour per day optimizing your storage layout? Nope, there's a 1-click sort button.

A huge, messy inventory and world floor full of unidentified items, with a bunch of scrolls of identification and scrolls of town portal in your inventory at all times? Nope. Portals are free (good, why should we permanently waste 1 slot for that?). Items are already identified (good, why should we waste time and space carrying totally worthless items around?). But best of all, the game has a built-in loot filter builder, where you can easily tell it ""hide all plain items, show me magic items, highlight items that give boosts to my class skills"" etc. The system is very deep yet very easy to use. You can play with the exact loot filters you need!

A cluttered inventory filled with endless crafting items that are playing tetris? Nope, there's a ""send to crafting forge"" button usable anywhere in the world, which moves them all into permanent storage immediately.

Stash tabs? You get 100+ huge tabs (with a global ""name/stats"" search), entirely via in-game gold!

Crafting? One of the best systems I've ever seen. You can break down items to extract their affixes, and then attach them to other powerful items. You can literally craft your own specialized gear.

Being trapped in a build? Nope. You can respec everything except your chosen Mastery (Ascendant Class, basically). And the respec costs are very reasonable, usually just a bit of in-game gold, or the time to level up your newly chosen skills. It's very liberating to be able to change your mind after investing countless hours into a character.

And then there's the way they have solved the ""auction house goblin vs farmer"" gameplay styles: You can specialize into trading or farming, depending on what you prefer to do. And you cannot trade items with the other ""faction"". So you can relax and enjoy the part of the gameplay you prefer the most.

They also solved the ""auction house goblin"" problem in these games, by making items account-bound after you buy them from other players. So you won't see goblins buying up all items on auction and re-selling them for 10x the price. Because that's totally impossible in Last Epoch. Thank GOD!

This just scratches the surface of the amount of innovation in this game!

The game even contains in-game help in every tooltip (by holding Alt) which reveals what every buff and status effect means, and also has an in-game guide with the G key which means that I have NEVER had to visit a wiki for this game. All of that is of course searchable in-game, so you can quickly find your answers. It's such a refreshing game design.

I've played 18 hours online in beta, and have zero bugs and zero lag. World transitions take around 3-6 seconds, at 25ms ping to EU West. People who said that the game lags online or that ""everyone knows the EU servers are awful"" must have terrible internet connections.

Perhaps most importantly of all, I have never seen any complaints about the game in the game's global chat either. That means the people who actually play the game are enjoying it!

My favorite game of this style was Diablo 2. The classic. This game has definitely dethroned that. :D So it even managed to beat my massive nostalgia goggles. :P Maybe Diablo's story is a bit cooler (gothic devil stuff), but Last Epoch's story is brilliant too!

Last Epoch also easily beats Diablo 3 and 4, the soul-less corporate games. Those games are so bland, so dumbed down, and so monetized that I am amazed that anyone even plays them at all.

And it even beats Path of Exile, the ""you need a math degree to make a viable build that won't get you crushed at endgame"". The story of Path of Exile is literal nonsensical garbage, and the world design is nowhere near as cool either. I used to love Path of Exile. But Last Epoch is way, way more fun in every way.

In Last Epoch, every build is viable, yet there's tons of depth to every character. Each base character can specialize into 3 different masteries, which unlocks different class trees and skills. Furthermore, every skill in the entire game has their own per-skill trees where you can choose your favorite customizations and adapt the skills to your desires, in very meaningful ways that wildly change the way the skill is used.

The per-skill trees are very deep and rival the size of entire class trees of Diablo. And they allow you to make any skill in the game viable for endgame. Sure, there's technically a ""best meta"" like every other game in the world, but the difference here is that you can play the way you want to play, and you don't need to follow guides like a slave.

It is even close to the skill depth of Path of Exile, without needing a math degree to play it. You'll discover that there are some ""obvious"" paths to play simple builds in Last Epoch if you're a beginner, but there's simultaneously an incredible amount of depth for people who want to create wild, crazy, unique builds with chain-cast synergies.

This is an amazing game. And I have complete faith in the game designers! It's the best ARPG I've ever played!

Last Epoch was refreshing from the get go , from the very first mob I killed it felt FUN , and when I opened the powers and talent tree option , while there were lots of things in there,  everything was extremely easy to understand.

Invested in buffing my minions, and I absolutely love my small army of undeath wrecking havoc across multiple time lines . the game is just FUN, the filters ? love em , the Crafting ? Simple while interesting with amazing items resulting from it.

So if you want something fun and interesting while not being as complex as to require a degree in nuclear physics to understand the damage you deal or a astrophysicist to invest your talents in.

The good

The campaign is good
The classes feel fun to play
The graphics are ok
Has a good build diversity
More endgame than Diablo2

The neutral and personal bias

The game is way too easy, I never felt challenged
The game plays a lot slower than d2/poe
No complicated mechanics, everything is straight forward.

The Bad

The crafting:
You add affixes/suffixes you want to your item, each time it does cost ""FP"" an item has a value of 10-40ish FP. When the FP run out, you cannot modify the item anymore.
Each try takes ~1-20fp with a chance of crit/glyph of not consuming any (like 30ish% total)
Removing affixes costs 1-25fp and targets a random affix.

TLDR - close your eyes and roll the dice a lot. You kinda have no control over the outcomes.
This wouldn't be so bad if the bases you might want to use werent so rare and/or filled with useless affixes.


Bugs:
Yes this is beta and I am pretty confident that those bugs will be fixed. On high graphics settings expect to encounter screen tearing, flickering and random crashes.

The endgame:
The endgame is a bit of fun for 5-20hours, after that it just gets insanely bland.

The Campaign.
While the campaign is good, it does take ~5hours to beat it. So every time you want to try a new class or subclass you have to make a new character going through the entire campaign.
No shortcuts like in PoE possible, there are some, but no amazing leveling uniques. You cannot share waypoints.

All in all, I would say the game definitely is worth its pricetag, it offered me ~50hours of fun for like 30€ that is nothing I can/will complain about.

The main problem being that Path of Exile does many things better than Last Epoch - on top of being free.
If you do not like Path of Exile or find it too complicated, it might be worth it in comparison, otherwise just play POE

-edit-

Now with the full release I wish I could give a double thumbs down.

New additions:
Outrageous zone transition times, coupled with an error disconnecting you.

Quests, some of them vital main quests occasionally cannot be completed - preventing you from progressing further.

Currently I can't recommend this game in any good faith at all. It will most likely take a while for the server architecture to get fixed and then some more to fix all the progression bugs currently in the game.

Yes the servers on launch have been bad but the game itself is still very much fun.

Give this game a chance. The servers will get better, there will be improvements but people are just so impatient. This studio has 90 people. 90! People! Give them a chance to get stuff fixed before you destroy their reviews online.

I am reminded every time an indie game releases that gets too much hype for it's own good.. *For the record*, contrary to what other reviews are saying, the game is completely 100% playable right now. The only issue plaguing the game right now is the online mode, which is honestly also completely playable imo aside from some pretty slow loading screen times at peak hours. And a few bugs dealing with co-op play. However this is an optional mode anyway as this is one of the only ARPGs that have released since like Grim Dawn that supports true offline play. So during these unstable server times, until they are updated for better load balancing, if you don't have much patience, you can simply choose to work on an offline character. If this were one of the games forcing always online play I'd understand some of the frustration. But it isn't, and not dealing with the servers at all is always an option. Offline mode is the exact same game minus co-op and the auction house. There's not even seasonal content at this time, so you aren't even missing out on that.

Anyway. Moving on. As far as the actual GAME, it is excellent. Itemization, item crafting, endgame, buildcrafting, balancing are all on point right at launch and some of the best I've seen in the genre. No fixes somewhere down the line with future seasons or expansions. It is solid as it is right now. Any future additions to the game will truly be additions and not efforts to fix the game in some way. As for difficulty/complexity, as others have said, I'd put this somewhere between Poe and Diablo which is a nice middle-ground where they respect both your time and your intelligence. There's also a ton of variety in environments which is nice. And the environments are really nice to look at too.

With all the toxicity going around, I hope devs see this review because they truly have done a great job with this game and I think it'll be a major fixture in the ARPG community for a long time to come.",1708825319,1708825319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Single player: 9/10

-Online: 2/10  currently broken, often offline or long queues with severe server instability. 

They nailed crafting in this game.  Upgrading weapons and armor is done in a very simple yet intricate way. 

Build diversity is phenomenal.  Passive skill trees are large and yet not overly difficult to manage/use.  Each class (5 classes at launch) has access to 3 sub classes each with their own skill trees.  You can access all 4 for builds (with set amount of passive skill points to use). There is no character customization.

The world map is large, there are different time lines in which you can explore the world in. Mob density is near perfect.  Difficulty in early to mid game is in a good place as well.  Leveling is evenly paced and enjoyable.

There is your typical loot for an arpg, its not overwhelming and at the same time it isn't lacking at all.  There is a very useful loot filter in game.  The stash system in game is dam near infinite in size. 

Currently the only glaring issue is that online isn't working at all.  I have been able to play online for only an hour at best.  Queue times are long if the servers aren't completely offline.  Single player is however working flawlessly and you have access to chat.

This is still Early Access, they just decided to call it a day and ""release"" the game as a marketing move. It is not done. The campaign is not complete, some skills don't yet have mastery trees, some tooltips are very lacking, etc.

My main issue with the game was terrible performance, but that part seems to have improved, at least.

It's a decent ARPG with sane damage formulas and a simple but interesting character build and item craft system. The moment to moment gameplay feels decent too now that the performance is improved.

Speaking of sane formulas and decent systems - the game has a in-game [b]Game Guide[/b] that actually tells you the formulas and explains the systems. You don't need to rely on a community wiki for that. This is really good and should really be standard practice for this genre.

One thing I like about the build system here is the Skill Specialisations - they accomplish what I think was the true potential of the Support Gem system of Path of Exile (that one unfortunately became nothing but a math game of optimising ""+x% more damage"" instead of having more gems that actually morph a skill into something different).

The story and narrative is.... really bad. The background lore and worldbuilding seems decent enough, nothing particularly good but not terrible either.

One minor annoying thing is that maps have zero persistence. Not even a second. Step out of a zone and the instance ceases to exist instantly - this applies to Town Portal as well. So no leaving loot on the ground for a short return trip or anything like that.

The game is complex enough to keep you engaged for a long time, yet incredibly accessible to newcomers. You don't need to look up a guide online, or follow anyone's build. The skill trees are flexible enough to try any number of combinations on your own and still achieve interesting results. That's not to say there isn't any challenge to this, just that it's structured so you can figure things out on your own. The skill resets are also very generous while committing to choices still feel meaningful. It's a nice balance.

There's a built-in loot filter, and crafting is fun without being tedious. It never feels artificially drawn out or unfair. There's also a rather novel mechanic in the way of factions. You can join one of two. Circle of Fortune grant bonuses for players who like to farm their own items. It's a bounty system with its own currency, delivered through an astrological style and flavor. The other is the Merchants' Guild, for players that prefer to trade items instead. Very cool.

Visuals, sound design, environmental ambiance and aesthetics are all A+. Combat is weighty and impactful. Skill combinations are fun, thematic, flexible and varied. Plus, the overall story lends itself really well into endgame activities. I'm surprised at how much I'm enjoying it, to be honest. Having owned this since early access, figured there was nothing new to see or be surprised by. The amount of polish applied really shows. 

There are people giving this game negative reviews due to launch day connection woes. I get it, but it's now two days later and all major issues have been resolved. If there's one thing I understand by now about online games, it's that the initial launch is always unpredictable. The fact that these devs solved it in two days is pretty stellar. They also gave updates on Discord for everything they were doing the moment they were doing it. At times, minutes apart. No bs pr nonsense. Just facts. It's an incredible amount of transparency that's basically unheard of. I'm not sure they fully understand how much this sort of honesty is appreciated. 

Finally, the price. $35 is a great for what you're getting. Yeah, there's an in-game mtx shop for cosmetics. I typically hate those on general principle. But you don't feel the need to buy anything here, ever. The only reason I considered it is due to how satisfied I am with the overall experience.

The Pros overwhelm the cons with how well thought of most of their systems has been.  It's definitely easier to learn and play than Path of Exile, without compromising on depth and content.

Pros:

- Great end game grind for better gear.
- The Arena and the Corruption in the end game both progresses the difficulty to fulfil a need for the gear grind.
- Crafting has many layers, too much to summarise.
- Build diversity is immense with each skills having it's own skill tree. Skills can have their damage types changed, change it's interaction entirely, auto cast other skills and more.
- More build diversity with a lot of options to spend passive skill points (from levels and main story quest) including up to halfway into those other sub-classes that was not chosen.
- Circle of Fortune faction is a great way to let you have a little bit more control of what drops.
- In-game tools that explains many of the mechanics a terms
- In-game loot filter that is relatively easy to use
- Each dungeon serve a unique purpose and have a very unique mechanic.
- Other than picking your subclass, everything else (skill specialization and passive skills) can be easily changed without potentially ruining a character.
- Leaderboard to compete against everyone, against each class and against party sizes.


Cons:
(Keep in mind that the game is still new, and the developers have been great in communicating with the community, which is a concept beyond most AAA studios.)

- Merchants Guild is too restrictive (especially towards casual players.)  It is also poorly explained as I had to scour the internet for someone who cared about it and took the time to learn all they can.
- Minor Bugs.  I have not encountered a game breaking bug. Most are visual effects or UI. (Having played prior to release, they fix a ton of gameplay bugs already going into 1.0.  With new sub classes and systems, these big changes are bound to run into a few hiccups.)

P.S. - Even though it was frustrating to deal with the server problems from the first 2 days of 1.0, the game itself is worthwhile, not only a great ARPG but just a great game in general.",1708822293,1708822293,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Theres a good amount of customization you can achieve with your skill trees. Yes, that's plural for one character. It is in beta so some major stuff at this time is unimplemented: multiplayer, 4 out of the 15 mastery classes, and some of the story (of which only goes to chapter 8 now). The story currently implemented (8 chapters) took me about 12 hours to ""complete"". There is an end-game system in place that'll let you farm gear after you've completed the story as well. Only frustrating thing so far I've experienced is getting the same legendary shield four times in a row.

If you're a fan of the genre I'd say it's worth the buy.

The server/matchmaking problems during the day of launch and the following days have been a big dissapointment. I've enjoyed playing offline mode while waiting for the servers to operate as they should, but I would of course preffered online playing.

The game itself has had some really good updates, and the gameplay feels better than ever. Even if I've been playing offline, I've enjoyed playing the game more than ever before. For me that is more important than  the server issues (given that EHG manage to sort them out in reasonable time). Be cause of that I still will give a positive review.

So, I was able to get into the game finally and can provide some initial thoughts. However I will be up front:  [b]The server infrastructure cannot handle the player volume, so loading areas often crashes, disconnects you, takes forever, and there are numerous issues rendering the game online pretty much unplayable. [/b]

I will update this if it changes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The skill system is really deep and rewarding, with plenty of meaningful choices for you to make, and it does so in a way that really lets you carve out your own play style.

General presentation is good, not as satisfying as PoE or Diablo 4 but for what it is the game is astounding. It's got better skill systems than Diablo 4 with more meaningful and unique builds; but it isn't overbearing like PoE. This is not better or worse than either, but it is a contender with them if they fix it's other issues.

There is one problem with the skills however. Respec is way too punishing. Not only does it cost gold and/or skill points, but changing a specialisation will take all or most of your skill points away entirely. It punishes you greatly for experimenting and not using build guides online. I very much dislike this.

Overall though, my first impressions would be mostly positive I think, but again, I could barely play due to the servers.

For PoE players, especially the ones who theory craft and limit test stuff themselves, I think you will have one of two reactions to the systems in LE. You will either appreciate how simple yet deep the item crafting is, or you will feel like there are things you still desire to have. 
LE isn't a game that dumps hundreds of mechanics on you and expects you to figure out how to use them in order to craft awesome items. But it also isn't so simple that you'll only farm items from drops. If you want to survive in the end game, you will be using the crafting systems. And while it might be slightly overwhelming at first, the more you use the forge, the easier it will become to identify if an item is just okay for your build or if its exceptional and a massive upgrade to your play-style. 
There is so much great content in this game that its hard to believe its only $35 in an age where games like this could easily cost you 60, 70 or even 100 dollars BOX PRICE and then still charge you an arm and a leg every 3 to 4 months for additional content. Last Epoch isn't like that.

This is the type of game developer that we all should support and give at least a little bit of a break. From what I can see find this indie developer that has less then 30 employees has done a tremendous job with the resources they have had trying to solve the issues.

This is their first big release and server management is always a tricky situation for any developer, especially when you suddenly have a influx of hundreds of thousands of people. It's not a easy fix where ""more servers"" will fix the issue, when thousands and thousands of people overload a systems with millions of actions per second their will be new problems that the developers never has encountered before with countless of stability problems constantly popping up.

The story isn't really something I typically pay attention to in ARPGs but it seems like the voice acting is good at least. All around enjoyable imo.

Loading screens are better -- however you can still tell during peak times they have server issues.

Partying still puts other people in different instances occasionally when switching maps -- wasn't this a core mechanic added w/ factions?

LOST CONNECTION - Add a announcement feature to your live service games and give a 15 minute warning. World of Warcraft came out when? Exactly.

It's a fun game -- but there are so many technical issues occurring I can see **by just playing** that are considered just to be 'best practice' in software development that have not been followed by the developers. ""But they're new"" -- and... your point? It's 2024 -- information is everywhere.

Still a negative while Party Issues exist.

--
I bought this game in early January. My biggest issue was maps taking a minute to load -- which as a software developer I was like ""Ah, it's not optimized yet, 1.0 is coming"". 

That issue is still here, but much worse. 
I can't play duo because my partner will occasionally join a random map and I have to port to them. Thus increasing the time I wait for a map change.

Get your servers fixed -- if the developers are true ARPG fans they know that the worst launch was Diablo 3 which was having the EXACT same issues -- do I need to wait for the expansion for this stuff to be fixed?

Endgame is in a good place for a new game. the game has a half and full offline mode! In 25 years of playing online games this is the first to implement either. Granted progression from offline play is not available for online play the fact hat you can play during server downtime is a major plus in my book.

This game is not perfect though. Far from it. There are some bugs that still exist in official launch. The servers are not optimized and a re causing a lot of MP issues. At some points logging in and/or zoning times are long. This is not the extent of the issues but it is the major issue at the time of this review.

Speaking of the devs, they are very communicative. Mike, a senior dev, does a Friday live-stream and answers community questions while playing the game.

If you want to play ""Online"" in an ""Online Service Game"" - well, come back in a week or two when nobody wants to play any more.

I would not recommend to buy any upgrades at that point. I unfortunately did that before the release...

Ok, it's now day 4. Servers still only sometimes work.
Discord and Forum are flooded with white knights who would defend EHG even if they would kill their hamster. It's ridiculous.

Let me see if i can get a refund on this clusterfuck.

Bow skills barely register, if the mob is slightly on a mole hill your skills wont register and things like Templar hammers just disappear for no reason, Fireball from Sorc is wonky to say the least, Reaper skill from Lich either goes and replenishes for a good period of time while using skills, other times it just doesn't at all, button responsiveness is really bad, I'd say it's even worse than POE and doesn't even come close to D4 or hell even D2 to that.

You can say it's early access as much as you like but the truth is it's out since 2019. Doing a graphical update doesn't warrant game-play mechanics to be ineffective and having a good chunk of input latency. If these get fix soon, I will edit my comment and change my review but until then this is quite bad.

Edit 23.02.24: Servers are dead, unplayable on online mode with problems with offline mode too. Really bad launch, one of the worst ones when it comes to ARPG's in recent history.

There is a hardware optimisation issue for the game that fps is really low. My old 6700k cpu and 1060 gpu goes with 45 fps and when I do monoliths and get a ton of mobs it can drop to 26. This is really bad as for example D4 even in the most mob dense situations it doesn't go under 70. If you have a newer PC you shouldn't have any problems here.

Edit the second 25.02.24: Servers worked fine in 24.02 but somehow they chocked again today.  Even tho the gameplay is good enough, kinda boring. Endgame mostly presume you do monoliths and some dungeons once in a while to merge gear.

Game development is something very difficult, and it can be difficult to scale things up.

I love the QoL improvements LE has over PoE and D4 (in-game loot filters, sort button, crafting item transfer button, ability to respec multiple times, and HUGE amount of stash space available to be bought with the basic game currency). As many have said, this game is a great ARPG for those that want a little more freedom and flexibility than Diablo offers but not as complicated as PoE.

The story is meh. I wouldn't consider the story to be super great but it's fine. The good news is the story doesn't take too long to get through and you can get keys for dungeons throughout your first play through that can help you skip story aspects if you wanna make another build in the same season. 

Endgame: The endgame is better than D4 in current state but not nearly as fleshed out as PoE. This is to be expected since PoE has 10 years of seasons that have added stuff to their endgame but that doesn't mean LE should be let off the hook for what is, currently, a relatively limited endgame. It's basically a watered down maps system without much else but it is still fun for a bit and held my attention much longer than D4 even in it's third season. 

Crafting/trading/observatory: S tier imo. The crafting system in LE is really well done and how they are handling allowing users to choose between trading guild or getting a higher drop rate to try to do it all themselves is the best system in the ARPG landscape currently. PoE has a really good system but can be a lot to digest and is very complicated for a more casual user. LE has a much more user friendly crafting and trading system and also allows the user to work to build the right gear for their build. 

I could go on but overall I would say this is a 7 out of 10 in the current state. It does what it set out to do - create an ARPG that can appeal to a casual ARPG player but offer enough flexibility and build crafting options to entertain a more hardcore ARPG enthusiast. They still have work to do on the endgame to ensure the hardcore ARPG enthusiasts have enough to do to stay invested in the game for more than a few weeks and they need to figure out the server side of things for the next season to ensure they don't have the same issues they had for the 1.0 launch. I also have to give props to the devs who did a great job maintaining constant communication with the player base on Twitter (X) and Reddit even though they knew it would consistently be met with an angry mob of users having trouble with logging in and long load times. Sad that this has to be a note to give props to versus the expectation but this is gaming in 2024.",1708817065,1708817065,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tried it again at 0.9.0 launch and was plagued by server issues and general instability causing a myriad of glitches and issues, particularly any time playing with a buddy was attempted. Tried it again after 1.0 launch and my original opinion is basically unchanged. The game (when you can get in and it works smoothly) is pretty damn fun and much easier to get into then the spreadsheet simulator Path of Exile can be at times, while also not being baby mode easy like Diablo. 

Unfortunately all of that means absolutely nothing when the servers and online portion of the game is essentially unplayable due to game breaking server instability. While there is an offline mode, myself and many others want the online mode for the ability to play with friends, and with the implementation of a trading system this patch, online capability is even more important for many others. Unfortunately, similarly to 0.9.0 launch, area transitions take minutes at a time and still have a chance to fail, crashing and disconnects are far too common causing areas to have to be run through again, and the game just isn't fun when your experience is constantly broken up by these sorts of problems. I figured that post 0.9.0 launch they would have some basic understanding of how to fix at least some of these issues, but this ""1.0"" still feels like a beta where they have no idea how to setup their servers in a way that works. 

Until every patch doesn't lead to the same always online bullshit frustrations, I can't recommend the game to anyone hoping for the online portion to work.

Camera zoom is so, so, so, so much better compared to PoE and Diablo 4. You can actually see more than 5m ahead. The 2 aforementioned are too closely zoomed in for liking.

Enjoying it so far. Gives me a lot of D2 vibes overall. :)

Little let down by the story/presentation of the story and that the campaign isn't finished. But it's cool. Time travel is a neat way to set up a lot of possibilities for future content.

From until where I got seems that L.E doesn't really reinvent the wheel in anything in particular (which sometimes for the genre, less is more), but still comes up with a few good ideas like having the changes in time eras (Chrono Trigger style) and offers some solid classic Classes choices but manages to add on top some unique Sub-classes that really diverge and feel different one from another, which will definitely bring a lot of replay value to try some different Classes and Sub-classes builds.

The biggest issues right now to point out are the technical problems they are having in these past days of full release, but they have mentioned they are working to fix them all as quick as possible so hopefully that's the case (also seems they will give one or two specific cosmetics to all players to compensate for this period) and also the story it's quite convoluted which becomes quickly uninteresting, but not the biggest issue to have in an ARPG since aside from that the rest is really solid.",1708816518,1708816637,True,2,0,0.540636062622070313,0,True,False,False

The game is great, simple as.

The visuals are flashy and modern, yet the game runs butter smooth (I think the first frame drop I ever saw was during said monolith when an enemy died and split into 50 mobs that all died instantly as well... the effects defintely forced my GPU to choke for a moment).

The soundscape is on point, and I particularly like the addition (in 1.0) of cues to your character state, such as stuns and whatnot. Voice acting is a bit hit and miss, with some characters having no voice acting, others having mediocre actor, and then you suddenly come across one guy you interact with once who's just on top of his game.

ARPGs aren't usually very story-focussed, but I've got to say that from any ARPG I've played, LE definitely does the story-part best. So that's a plus to whom it may concern.

Gameplay wise, it's an ARPG, and it does it's job well. I would love WSAD controls and people have asked for a mouse button invert option, but other then that the controls are tried and tested. Kudos to ability key presses being queued instead of eating, meaning you can hold down your base attack key, then hit an ability key and the ability will fire off after the next base attack animation completes.

But the game's biggest strength, by far, is it's itemization and skill specialization systems. I've often heard the comparison that 'LE is more complex than cookiecutter Diablo 4, but also doesn't require you to have a PhD like Path of Exile'. Which is fairly accurate, but I would append that I don't actually see LE's build concept as less complex than PoE... but it's way better organized and intuitive.
And the variety is just staggering. You can pick up a mage, take his basic lightning blast, and turn it into anything. Fire beam? Yup. Cold Aoe? Jup. Channelled Force Lightning? Aye. Frontloaded chain lightning on cooldown? Covered, too. Now consider that each class gets like 10 base skills, and then another 5 based upon the chosen mastery, and each of those skills comes with a skill tree of *that* flexibility... and you actually start thanking the devs that you can only ever use (and level up) five of those skills per character.
(The game does fully support respeccing though. Except for your class mastery (aka subclass), you can switch out *everything*, costing only some meager amounts of exp and gold.)
Itemization wise, the game takes ARPG standards and adds an extremely freeform and nuanced crafting system to it. You still move from item to item across the leveling up process, but not nearly as rapidly as in older ARPGs, and you can break down items with useful effects to then slap those effects onto your current gear. It takes some time figuring out how to use this system efficiently, but once you got a grip on it, it's a blast and I fear I might not be able to play any ARPG with a lesser system ever again.

As for downsides, the only one I can see right now is that Multiplayer and Item trading is abit of a dumpsterfire, due to the stability issues for online mode (servers being overloaded by player count, the usual). Thus it's strongly advisable to play in Offline Mode (which the game has in two variants, one with global chat, and one without. Both of them run locally and skip any server issues).

And whilst I cannot yet exhaustively comment on the endgame (aka mechanics, legendary crafting, etc), from my first glance into monoliths it looks like a good mix of precedural and roguelike elements to create longlivety. Ntm that the game already has a vast replayability based upon the number of classes, subclasses, and build possibilities within subclasses.

Lastly, I'll point out the very positive experience with the dev team, which is running on a refreshling straightforward policy of open and honest communication (and a lovely portion of snark towards their AAAA-competitors). It's very obvious they're passionate about their game, and anyone who has been following the industry recently, knows that's a VERY good quality to have.


Overall, I would give the game an 8/10, with the major subtractor being the server issues, and a minor detractor being occasional (usually visually or text) bugs and a few missing QoL features.

As of now the game is in a bad state.

First 3 days of 1.0 and servers are up and down with horrible performance for most ppl.

What i have seen:

Multiple login attempts needed to get to character select.
Never connects after selecting a character(alt-f4 required).
Huge loads between zone transitions, town being the biggest, can last 1-30min, with you just sitting in zone with a ""entering"" msg and then you hit the load screen.
Travel will fail and you will never hit the load screen(try agian).
Never leave load screen(alt-f4).
DC randomly or during loading.
Quests are real easy to break:
TP to town and u loose the npc and the quest will not update without zoning to previous zone to respawn npc.
Quest that auto travels you and the travel fails and you will have no quest and have to look through the map to travel to the place where the quest is.

Disastrous launch. Can understand a few hours getting things tuned up. But every area you load into (and in this game there is a lot) its an additional 10-30 mins just sitting around. Will update if resolved quickly. Buyer beware for now if you want to play online.

But it turned out that in this game there was no place for joy or delight, only a cold wind of silence and hopelessness, enveloping me like a black hole, absorbing everything bright.

Last Epoch was the promise of a new beginning, a new world, but instead it became my final fall into a bottomless pit of disappointment. I opened the doors of this world in the hope of finding solace and the opportunity to immerse myself in impressive gameplay, but what did I find? The servers, like cracked bridges in a forgotten city, were destroyed, leaving me alone with static images.

Like raindrops endlessly falling from the sky, my expectations were shattered by the harsh reality of faulty servers. The face of the night was frozen with an expression of sadness, and my heart, like glass, cracked with pain, flooding me with waves of endless suffering.

In this black and white palette, where shades of gray turn into my tears, I wander through the loading screens of Last Epoch, searching for answers, only to find stubborn silence. And in this hopeless darkness, where even the night seems brighter than my future, I understand that this era is not the last, but only a new chapter in the book of my disappointment.",1708814538,1708814538,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Last Epoch is probably the most fun I've had since Diablo 1. LE is one of the few games that doesn't punish you for respeccing which allows you to experiment and learn how to play your class. You can learn what works and what doesn't work on your own, without forced into meta slavery and needing to know exactly who you want to be when you grow up from the day you are born. This is a HUGE positive for any ARPG because it's a rare design philosophy.

I've got about 2 to 3 years of experience in this game. The fight and boss mechanics are exciting and can be challenging. There are progressively challenging end game activities that range from speed clearing maps, waves of enemy arena's, and dungeons. All of which have unique rewards and the replayability of this game is IMO the best in the entire genre.

Class design and loot make this game extremely fun. I've seen three lighting rune master builds in the last week, all of which play very differently, and are all very powerful at endgame with their own strengths and weaknesses. This is the only ARPG where I have replayed a class more than once. I have 3 druids, 2 rogues, and 2 sorcerers. Part of this is because of unique loot but mostly it's because every skill that you choose to use has it's own unique skill tree on top of your class's skill tree, combined with your unique specialization skill tree. Build diversity in this game is fantastic. It has depth, but doesn't punish you for not understanding the mechanics by letting you respec easily.  There really is no barrier to entry in this game like other ARPG's.

I reached this lvl because I played the game offline. While the devs really try their best and being transparent people are justified to their opinion that the launch is a mess. And to avoid this whole bad experience i went offline (even tho normally I would go for trade league)

So the review is only viewed with perfect conditions since i only played offline. 
I was met with no bugs that i could notice in my whole play-through, the campaign i didn't really care to read but the art was cool and the characters were voiced over. Some bosses were pretty funny sounding (Lagos).
Endgame systems such as the Monolith and Arena is where the main thing is at. Which are a great way to progress endgame. 
Monolith is more like Maps (of PoE) rather than D4 (Nightmare dungeons), but very transparent about rewards and what to expect on each node. 
Arena is a harder mode of progress, i do not know if u actually get better loot from this, because i didnt run it too many times, doing endless arenas offline feels useless since its about leaderboards, but i did Tier 1 of waves and it was pretty fun. You select modifiers which modifiers you want from 2 options and they stack all together as much as you progress (so be careful to remember what you put on there for endless).

But the best part about Last Epoch is Crafting, if you like crafting, you going to love this game. It is fun, you can do it from anywhere and very early on, and with that way you can also make your Alts crazy strong from the start. Being able to put the stats you want, or crafting your own unique items for your build is awesome, and it all correlates to your loot filter, since games like this drop too many items, if you set your loot filter right, you can make it in a way to show you specifically what you looking for, and not only that, but imagine that you can do that for the crafting as well. if you are farming a specific thing, for your crafting (because the way that you get affixes/sufix is by destroying items with said affix/suffix and get it's shards) you can set it off to that and continue farming without being pestered with useless drops *cough d4*. 

This game has the same fluidity of character combat as Diablo games but the a milder system volume and complexity of Path of Exile. So far i prefer it from both, I found diablo 4 to be mostly a waste of time or 2 days games per season, and Path of Exile as a new player i had to do research harder than i do for programming. 

This game you can experiment, you don't have to search for builds immediately. If it fails you can reset your stuff at pretty low cost. So my suggestions for anyone jumping into this would be:
1) Try offline mode, it may sound like it's a bad thing, but if you don't plan to play immediately with your friends  it is the best way to experience the game atm
2) Experiment, this game lets you go wild with experimenting, and if it doesn't work out, go to maxroll and check a guide out, you don't even need to do everything the same, but get inspiration of what would work better
3) Try out crafting and buy early the runes of shattering to break the main stat and resistances that you want to upgrade or put into your items.",1708812858,1708812858,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But it's not ready yet. Should have stayed in the oven some more.

These are issues I noticed in roughly 3 hours:

-Portals don't work half the time.

-Server issues.

-Unable to rebind RMB, why?

-Map opacity don't stay the way I want, resets when I exit Settings.

-Spelling errors.

-Long loading times.

-Co-op feel very unpolished. Lots of stuff not working (chat, social/friend menu, minimap etc), and no enemy scaling?

-Enemies don't interact with for example water when they are dead. They just end up landing ON it. And on the same note some enemies don't ragdoll off of cliffs when they should and just float in the air. Gives a sloppy impression and breaks immersion.

-A Main Quest NPC wasn't interactable and no explaining why - had to google it to find a workaround.. been an issue since last year.

I like the game in general. Just sad it was released way too early..
I hate being a beta-tester when I buy a 1.0 release. So it's a thumb down for me, but I'll be back later.


Edit:
I've been playing offline since my initial review.
Works much better as one could imagine.
I'll let the thumb down hang here still though, since there are still quite a few issues that don't belong in a 1.0 release.
I'm angry with myself that I fell for the hype, I should know better by now. :<

Uninstalled today. There's just so many small annoying flaws. And the game relies heavily upon crafting rather than loot, and the crafting is not that interesting and also badly explained.

Cons:

Loading screens every 10 seconds, with bad servers you just wait 5 min to load per screen. Poor design choice, making play through first 58 levels VERY annoying as you spend more time waiting at load screens than playing the actual game. 

The chat setting of who you want to talk to keeps switching from whispers or party chat to global on each loading screen.

The game crashing in The Shattered Valley and the Courtyard, has been submitted in bug reports during beta and has never been fixed. Crashed over 30 times in these 2 zones, no crashing anywhere else.

Very small radius for gold pick up making it ""time waste"" to pick up gold. Gold pick up range needs to be significantly increased or add a pet to pick up gold for us!",1708808812,1708812370,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Changing review to positive since the devs seem to have fixed the major issues and I was finally able to play a full day without any problems.

Great game that doesn't revolutionise ARPG's but takes what has worked best in the genre so far and seamlessly merges them into a polished package that is very obviously made by fans of the genre. 

Your character and skills feel powerful. You can build your character the way you like and don't have to ever bend over backwards to play the game the way some game designer intended like in D4 chasing every last possible stat effect... On the other hand your class choice matters in determining the archetypes available to you and isn't just an optimisation exercise like in PoE.

The graphics and effects are great. The art and level design is just gorgeous and really immerses you into the drastically different eras and regions each with unique enemies and abilities that feel like they are a part of their environments vs the generic cold/fire/lightning reskins of the same mobs over and over again in much higher budget games. 

I'm also really enjoying the story. It feels fresh and not chock full of generic fantasy cliches. There's just the right amount of side quests and optional dialogues that give you a little extra immersion to dial home the ramifications of the wars and disasters on the poor regular folks just trying to survive.

In summary, if you haven't played an ARPG in a while like me and need to scratch that itch with a fresh stick, I totally recommend. It might not blow your mind but it'll definitely satisfy it.


*Original Review*

Hate to put out a negative review on a game where the devs are so obviously passionate about it, but the game just doesn't work right now. Passion and design frankly just don't matter if the product you're selling doesn't work...

It started with the class selection, which is gender locked. I love playing a Necromancer, but alas I am not a female and therefore had to switch to a different class. So mage it is.

Then the graphics are not that great to be honest. I guess it looks better in the trailers and their web page than on my screen. And yes, all graphical settings are maxed out.

For spells, I find myself pressing the same single spell button mainly because it blasts everything in it's path. The rest of my skill bar is filled up with different spells, why I have no idea.

I have not seen any point in the skill trees, as this single spell is really all I need to wipe the floor with everything I encounter, including the mini bosses.

Also this game is buggy. I'm running into spells/abilities not working as intended with some regularity.

Finally, the endgame itemization isn't that interesting. A lot of builds simply don't have a decent unique or set that will do anything transformative for them, In the end the best of the best stuff will probably be +skill affixes since so much of your damage and mitigation is built into your skill tree.

-I don't feel any ""impact"" from 90% of my spells and attacks, thus combat feels meh. [Strike]This is without a doubt my largest complaint that's killing the experience for me.[/strike]
[b]-Crafting. When it dawned on me that the itemization in this game mostly revolves around crafting and that the most exciting things you can find are shards with a specific stat to put on your gloves I gave up and uninstalled. I hate crafting so much and it was not clear to me how much emphasis the game puts on it.[/b]
-Game does not feel accessible, sure there are guide articles but most of them are just so cumbersome to read, with mathematical equations as part of the explenation. D4 for all it's shortcomings atleast did not make me feel like I had forgotten to study for a test and looking at text going ""Should I understand this?""
-QoL things like not beeing able to compare offhand weapons when dual wielding, something that's been asked for in in their forums since 2021 and devs writing in 2023 ""We're working on it!"". And the inventory ""roleplay"" where I need to go in and press the button ""Transfer Materials"" just because reasons?
-Story, there might be a story, but it did not capture me enough from the start to even pay the slightest attention. Who is my character? Why is my character? Who are any of these other characters? Why am I in this dark world where I can't  see anything?
-Loot, I don't look at anything. Loot filter is very nice, but it leads to me not looking at 95% of all the stuff that drops. All it does is clutter upp my inventory, I can only ""salvage"" it with the use of a 2000 gold rune, unique items can't even be salvaged or altered in any way, I can sell items for a miniscule amount of gold and what am I supposed to even do with gold?

Many of my minus points might be interpreted as me not understanding or ""getting"" lots of stuff, beeing lazy and not caring. But the problem is that I am lazy and not caring because the game has not done a good job of introducing these systems and quirks. It feels like I'min PoE light. Where as in D4 I got to maxroll or youtube to get tips for what builds are cool. Here I'm looking at videos that can explain to me what even is going on. 

And lastly the hypocrisy from the community about a cosmetic store. D4 gets ALOT of criticism for this, that the coolest items are stuck behind an ingame currency, it't the same here!

Playing the beta it felt a little rough, but after you get some movement and attack speed things seem to smooth out a lot. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes but I wish I had a better vid card.

1.0 launch was a bit rough with the server log in and loading issues but for me it's just a small bump in the road for release of the game.

So, for that reason, I can recommend it to people who are looking for that. There's tons of itemization puzzling and the crafting system is smart, and skills have skill points and sometimes it changes the skill. It's obvious a ton of time and energy went into the variety of skills and nuances there. 

For me, I'm a little bored by this game already and struggling to get through the campaign because the core gameplay just isn't there for me. I don't feel like I'm fighting, I feel like I'm playing a game where I'm thrashing my scissor hands through paper. It doesn't feel visceral, crunchy, or weighty. I know some people don't even notice this stuff, but a lot of the skills are AOE of about the same size, because the only thing to do is to walk long distances and clear trash. Of course, conquering hordes is what dungeon crawlers are supposed to offer, but I don't feel like a dungeon crawler, I feel like a person playing a game. I keep waiting for something to happen and it doesn't. The only memorable enemy for me are the exiled mages. Everything else could be ""hit me"" signs for all the difference it makes. 

I have some other gripes, but they are really minor, like the character just looking so goofy to me personally, and the controller support just isn't quite good enough, I frequently switch to MnK for anything other than gameplay. That said, I am sure a lot of folks out there, this is exactly what they are looking for. Very Diablo 2 style walking from point A to point B with a map overlay and tons of loot on the floor, most of it uninteresting. Crafting system is really unique, I like it quite a bit. It would be nice to get a game that's trying to not just do Diablo 2 but better. The time concept was cool, feel like it was a missed opportunity to bring in a fresh aesthetic not a classic one.

I think its a testament to the team that they have been transparent about issues and have obviously been grafting to resolve them. Hopefully in the coming days the issues from launch are a distant memory and people can review the game in the context of game play.

 Moving onto that the game itself is great fun. Builds are complex enough to be engaging and require a little bit of thought but not so complex (as POE) where you need to sink hours into refinement and use 3rd party software to calculate damage in order to enable late game viability (massive POE fan here). Love the crafting system and itemisation most of all. Crafting is a favourite feature of mine in any game and LE does an amazing job at offering an easy to understand but relatively complex crafting system that balances RNG and deterministic outcomes. Overall a great game and well worth playing for ARPG fans. 

As of yesterday I have been able to play free of technical issues with minimal bugs, I know this has not been the case for everyone. If this would ruin your game experience perhaps wait a week, the devs seem to be working overtime to eliminate these issues.

I purposefully waited for 1.0 before touching or even researching the game, to have the purest experience, so I could have avoided buying it in the first place, but here we are. I was told this would be the best ARPG by miles until PoE2 comes out.

Graphics and performance - visuals are horribly dated most of the time, like, Grim Dawn levels of dated. There are some interesting and creative environments and monster designs but they are completely ruined by choppy animations. Skill effects are bland, with a few exceptions (pray that the skill you like the look of is actually viable - most aren't). Performance is weak, with completely unjustifiable CPU and GPU load given how dated the visuals are.

Gameplay - Movement feels okay, choppy outdated and clipping animations aside. By far the biggest issue with the game, however, is the absolute lack of impact in combat. To say that it feels like everything is made of paper and foam is an insult to both those materials. This is an absolute deal breaker in an ARPG. A game where you spend 99% of your time exploding, impaling and quartering monsters to get a dopamine hit, Last Epoch feels like trying to lick ice cream through a window. 

Story is trying way too hard to be deep and complex, but ends up being so convoluted and forgettable I completely tuned out around the third time travel jump. There is a ton of zones but most of them are tiny, and feel copy-pasted.

While I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs, there are a ton of aesthetic ones. Missing icons, texts, wrong tooltips popping up (I really wanted to compare the stats between my helmet and my weapon, thanks LE). There is a general lack of polish all around. It could have used another year in early access.

I will not comment on classes, character progression, itemisation, crafting and the endgame because I have no motivation to engage with those systems, in-depth and good as they probably are, because of the points I raised above.

Furthermore, and I did not want to put this first because everyone is talking about it, the game is still outright unplayable online as of today, over three days after launch, after years of early access. I played a little bit of offline but that mode is basically pointless, as its missing core features of every modern ARPG, it does not allow cosmetics (which they happily let you pay for), and any progression is separate from online. Their constant promises of fixes and improvement amount to nothing, and I suspect the problem will only fix itself when people lose interest and stop trying, a week from now. I just tried to log on for the last two hours, three days in a row, and I know for a fact I will not be trying anymore for a good while after submitting this review.

If you are considering buying this game right now, don't. It is not worth the full price at the moment. Wait until at least the online mode is properly fixed (do not believe dev forum posts, check with actual players). I personally have fundamental problems with the game that will probably never be fixed - the lack of combat feel and the overall poor quality of animations, and if I did more research before buying, I would've passed on this one.",1708809765,1708809765,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Their gameplay mechanics may have been finished and ready to go to 1.0, but a modern video game is so much more than just a collection of mechanics. The network connectivity of this game is just as much a part of the experience as the 15 sub-classes, and it's not ready. They should have launched a 0.99 patch that had the new classes, bugfixes, etc, and then spent a month prepping their infrastructure to handle their existing player base as smoothly as possible. Then, at least they'd have been prepared to scale the infrastructure up to accomodate more players.

TLDR: This game is not worth your money until the servers are fixed. It's embarrassing that they called this the 1.0 launch when core features of their game (networking and multiplayer) aren't done.

LE has sufficient complexity in character/build creation to remain interesting for extended periods of time. Every skill has its own skill tree with up to 20 points you can distribute (more with items that boost skill levels), and those points can sometimes drastically alter the way a skill plays. You can specialize in up to 5 skills this way. For example:

Frost Claw, a mage skill, normally shoots out 3 projectiles in wide arcs that deal a burst of combined cold dmg on impact at the cursor location when cast. The Artor's Sceptre node increases the dmg of the skill, and also adds a chance to inflict frostbite (cold DoT). The Lava Talon node will convert this skill to a fire skill, changing its damage and scaling, and change the frostbite chance from before to ignite instead. Hand of Morditas adds 2 more projectiles, and Volley of Glass removes the burst on impact, but staggers the projectiles and they can now all hit the same target. So it becomes a fantastic single target dps skill that stacks ignites very quickly on the target. Grab some cast speed and you've got a fire slinging machine gun.

Wanna make it crazier though? Grab Celestial Conflux, and now you have a chance to cast Elemental Nova on the target once per cast. You can put nodes into Elemental Nova's tree to specialize its damage type, or customize it, just like you would with Frost Claw.

That makes the skill's mana cost quite large however, so you'd then need to build items/other skills to compensate. It all gets quite deep and interesting, and we're not even talking about unique/legendary items yet.

Yes there have been some connectivity/stability issues post-launch, but that's generally expected and already mostly mitigated as of a couple days in.

This game doesn't offer the sad BS D4 has brought to their gamers..  
This game also doesn't make things too complicated as PoE was. Hitting that wall was just a quick good bye!  

The Last Epoch It's a great game with a great story!

The negative comments are mostly about servers, but if you want some real criticism I would say trade factions need to be tweaked. Specifically in how you can bounce back and forth as many times as you want. Even though items are limited to those factions, if you have one good set not allocated to any faction you can easily grind empowered monoliths at base corruption and continue to switch your faction. This is especially accessible when your faction rank doesn't reset lol. I don't really mind that right now because at least Im getting a ton of loot in a legit way. Just seems a bit too good. Not to mention a lot of balance changes and bugs that need to be looked at. 

Overall super solid launch from the team considering there were lots of people who were able to play within the first two days. I'm honestly not sure if loading screens are something they could have prepared for, but their game director Judd has been more than transparent with the community about whats going on in their discord, and I don't understand how people can complain about that. Do you want a sketchy dev team that doesn't tell us anything? I have played games with these problems and they die because there is no passion or communication. Anyone who knows EHG knows they're drowning in passion and welcome constructive criticism. The hate is unwarranted in my opinion.

The game is just boring. There's very little enemy variety and the game is very, very easy. There's no way to scale up the difficulty during the 2-3 hour campaign, so you will get board quickly. It's even easier when playing with friends. I was mowing down enemies so fast as a Mage my brother had nothing to do. On top of that, the loot is boring and there is very little variety in loot. For some reason they made treasure chests few and far between and affixes on items are so vanilla and uninteresting the game makes Diablo 4 look like a masterpiece in comparison. You shouldn't have to wait until corruption tier 500 for some challenge. The story concept is interesting, but dumb. I guess technology is stagnant over thousands of years? Devs shouldn't do time travel if they're on going to change the map to a dark theme. Being an indie game, there's tons of little quirks that will annoy you as well. For example, if you try to equip a 2 handed weapon when your character had something in their offhand, you won't be able to equip it, which made be think several times I couldn't use a 2 hander when I in fact could. Controller support is there, but is poor compared to competitors. You have to stand still to listen to this game's equivalent of audio logs. Sometimes quests will just break and you have to restart the game to fix it. The list goes on. The game's main selling point is skills and there aren't very many of them. What skills are there have a lot of overlap. You could probably get by spamming one skill to beat the game, because there's very little reason to every change things up outside of boredom. The skill trees for individual skills are the coolest feature, but even they suffer from every skill having a +% damage modifier, allowing you to scale past the game very early on. How did the devs not see this as a balance problem? Why didn't they just copy Diablo 3's skill system which is much simpler and easier to use. See, the problem is that you can only level up 5 skills and if you want to experiment and change skills well the devs say f you, you're going down to the minimum skill level and have to level up your skills again. Why not let people freely swap back and forth like Diablo 3? Wouldn't that be more fun? Music is bland, not offensive, but not good either. Sound effects are horrible and make the combat not feel ""crunchy"" like the Diablo series. It's not satisfying to play. Maps are not random and very linear. Paths may branch slightly but most other games of this genre have bigger maps and reasons to actually explore them. Like I mentioned before, your lucky if there is 1 treasure chest per zone. Many have none. I haven't even mentioned the ""crafting"" system, but imho it's not great. You can only change existing items, but not craft new ones. You can't reroll existing affixes you don't want. It's basically another upgrade tree for endgame that you can safely ignore.

This game is an almost, but not quite with tons of technical issues. The game was in beta for 5 YEARS before the 1.0 launch and it's really telling it's still so content poor and unstable after all this time. What has the devs been doing this whole time? Not very much apparently. Path of Exile, Diablo, Titan Quest, ect. There's a ton of other Diablo clones that do it better. Hard pass.",1708806437,1708807329,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics: Overall, it's a Unity game, and with that comes setbacks; animations are locked to 60fps (Not the game; the game can be unlocked), and animations feel stiff without consequence. For example, hitting enemies with a two-handed mace feels and looks underwhelming.
     - Art direction is highly subjective, but I find it lacking; I find the environments and monster design unappealing. I'm not saying EHG doesn't have good artists, but their sense of scale and direction is not for me.

Sound: there is not much to say here, but I will say I'm disappointed in combat sound; nothing sounds 'big' or 'powerful,' a constant issue I have with many games that push the 'epic' marketing for their game. Best example I can give is listen to a Primalist's Upheaval cast in LE and than listen to a Barbarian's Upheavel in Diablo 4 (this isn't a D4 vs LE comparison, but both use the same skill and close animation) for sound difference and you'll hear what I mean.
     -Voice acting is good; they chose a good set of talent for that.

Gameplay: This is my biggest gripe when it comes to ARPGs. Every game has been chasing Diablo 2 and managed to come up short; despite bringing new ideas to the table, they seem to need that core feel. This game brings some unique ideas with its crafting system and ways to roll affixes to gear, but the core gameplay could be more varied and fulfilling. It seems hollow to piggyback on my Diablo 2 statement; by the time you hit level 5 in that game, you're already starting to feel the power creep. This game, like most other ARPGs since D2, feels hollow and weak by comparison. Combat is the core of an ARPG; without it, feeling fulfilled early on is a huge missed opportunity, and you'll commonly hear things like: ""It's so much better at endgame!"" Alas, it would be best if you didn't have to put tons of hours into a game for it to finally feel good at the end, a gripe I have firmly with PoE.

Despite server issues (which are grossly abundant and take away from the online experience), this game doesn't feel polished or complete, and my problems with it are fundamental at its core. It is on that notion that I do not recommend this game if you're looking for a ""Diablo clone"" that feels like Diablo (Diablo 4 excluded; that's another story in and of itself) because this is not it.

Edit 1: The 60fps animation issue was fixed; it originally had the FPS limiter off, but putting it back on and raising the limit to 300fps (max) resolved it. This may be an RTX 40 series issue, as friends with other cards did not run into this issue.
Edit 2: I will say the gameplay is growing on me, especially with the loot filter and crafting system. Though I still stand firmly on my prior criticisms of the game, but I am enjoying it more as I get further in from a gameplay perspective.
Edit 3: I can't believe I'm doing it, but I am. I'm flipping my recommendation. I still have a lot of the qualms listed above, but the unique way to spec your character is growing on me and I find myself getting more invested as a result, so clearly I'm enjoying my time.",1708642051,1708807250,True,0,0,0.363833248615264893,0,True,False,False

Edit: Now that servers seem to be a bit more I'd like to expand on my initial review. **Servers are still not fixed apparently endgame isn't as affected I'm finding out**

The game does a lot of things really well and very uniquely to other ARPGs you may have played. It also has really nice ways of incorporating things you may be familiar with, such as loot filters which are built right into the game and after a little bit of playing with, are very straight forward and easy to understand.

Some of the things I think this game does really well are things like playable classes, the campaign, and trading vs non trading/and wrapped into this, playable game modes.

Playable classes: This game has some of the most unique combinations of classes I've seen in an ARPG and to summarize what I mean by this we can use the Runemaster as an example. The class is crazy with the different ways it can built (and still viable) and how unique it plays with each different way you want to play it as. What do I mean by this. The class uses different elemental abilities and each time you cast an ability you take that abilities element as a rune. Rune combinations can then be used up to 3. So if I use a fire spell I will get a fire rune, then if I use an ice spell I will get an ice rune for a combo of 1 fire rune and 1 ice rune, in that order and order matters. Combining these rune combos then allows you to do different abilities that range from buffs to devastating attacks. It's a really really cool class and it's very different from what I've seen in other games. 
NEGATIVE: Each class has 3 subclasses and the game makes you choose 1 at a certain point in the game. This is a locked decision and a lot of people think this is a negative. Me personally, I don't mind the idea of leveling other characters but I understand this as a fair point. I will point out that even though you are locked to the subclass you've chosen, you are able to spec into passive points of the other 2 sub classes you didn't choose, up to a certain point.

The Campaign is usually what people hate the most in ARPGs (I think this may be a bit of an illusory truth effect) and I was somewhat in this way of thinking until Diablo 4 came out. I went into launch day campaign and realized they actually added some little things that made me appreciate the campaign a bit more. For example they added these ""events"" ( can't remember the name of them right now) that allow you to fight this elemental wizard guy and then drop special items that have special affixes that are interesting, not always good but interesting none the less. This is just one example but it makes the campaign a bit less tedious and made me want to explore a bit and see what little things were hiding.

The play modes are almost standard when compared to something like PoE where it has softcore, hardcore, softcore solo self found and hardcore solo self found however they split up solo self found into 2 different modes as well. They've made solo account found where all items you find are shared between characters, and solo character found meaning all gear found is per character. I think solo account found is the way for me but for people wanting a bit more of challenge I thought this was cool. Wrapping up the faction system into this seems applicable as well since the way this game does TRADE vs NON-TRADE is pretty cool. The make it a bit of a grind but you can choose between wanting to trade with other players and opting into that faction, which as you level up will allow you to trade different types of gear, or you can opt into the circle of fortune which enables buffs to loot drops as you level it up, with the down side of you cannot trade with other players and you cannot trade any of the items found with the buffs from circle of fortune (this maybe all items or just ones found with the buff, still a little uncertain). You can switch between the factions but you will not be able to farm with circle of fortune then trade those items later. On top of that, they also have different systems in place to keep you engaged and help farm specific gear and they call them prophecies (this is for circle of fortune as this is the faction I've chosen but I'm assuming the Merchant faction also has something like this) 

TLDR: The game is unique and fun to play in many ways and has put a lot of QoL into the game without taking away what makes an ARPG good. Yes launch had some server issues, which now seem to be mostly resolved, but the game itself is really solid and worth a play",1708639410,1708806235,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The overall gameplay is good, but to me the game lacks a soul and nothing about it is memorable to me thus far. Aside from like 2 bosses, I don't even recall any of the rest of them and I still don't even know their basic moves.

For context I was a previous POE player but haven't been for a couple leagues. My char in LE is a lvl80 Acolyte Lich running a personalized version of the DeathSeal build.

Good thing I liked about LE:
The leveling process was fun. Gameplay is smooth. Everything that makes an ARPG feels good is there. I like both the flexibility of the skill and crafting system.

Things I dislike about LE: 
-The game seems to actively discourage listening to the story. If you even accidentally press a button it skips a cinematic. I usually like paying some attention to the story but I could not even try for LE because of this ""feature"".
-Game zones reset upon ANY rezoning. You literally can't explore a map fully because its something that resets, even for towns. I really dislike this. I'm pretty sure this ""feature"" broke several quests during the campaign for me and I had to restart ~5 times throughout the campaign because something broke. This is not a major issue though as there is never any reason to clear a map, but it adds to the lack of soul feeling.
-Difficulty Level/Regular Enemies: The game feels very easy to me thus far...to the point where I still can't recognize any of the enemies until I see them to their major attack if they have one. I honestly have almost no idea what any of the regular enemies do aside from a few of the really big looking ones, and this is partially because of the low difficulty I think. Everything just dies and doesn't warrant further thought. Even at level80...I have like -10 to +20 resists (very low!) and I get by just fine and rarely ever die. I feel like there are a decent number of enemy types and some do some cool stuff but I guess I just can't appreciate it for these reasons.
Bosses: I won't too much about endgame bossing because aside from monolith bosses and the initial bosses from the arena/soul bastion/etc I haven't really done them at high levels. Though for the initial levels I did them at (levels 45-60ish), I kind of just steam-rolled them so they felt pretty weak to me. For bosses, this is the only time where I felt that resists somewhat mattered. Lagon boss at the lvl75 monolith killed me in 1-shot sometimes when I didn't have any cold resists and Majasa during the story mode was pretty hard without physical resists. Aside from these two bosses that I've died on, I have no idea what other bosses exist, because they are so unmemorable and I never even bothered to learn their attacks.
MerchantsGuild: I think the Merchant vs Fortune guild is a cool idea...I did merchant, but its such a pain to figure out how much an item you have is worth that is almost seems not worth selling anything unless you are at the late-endgame and selling very high-tier stuff.",1708709662,1708805884,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now I just need to decide if I am going to use more sick days. This game makes you want to try out every class and see just how they measure up to my mage. I am looking forward to future content and updates. The CEO of this game is a pretty decent dude, knows how important it is to keep the players happy. All in all this is a game I feel great referring to people. Sure, there are capacity issues and little launch bugs here and there but they have already patched it a few times and more is on the way. 

To be fair the server issues we had to deal with didnt even bother me. That's how much fun this game is.

Out of respect to the talented developers I'll join a large number of players in encouraging you not to pay much attention to the negative launch reviews.  This game had 90%+ reviews until launch day where they had some back-end/API services issues that were creating loading errors in the online version of the game.

If you're mature and patient enough to allow the Indie Devs (EHG) to fix this, I think you'll find this game to be quite awesome.  I'm relatively new to ARPGs, but after sinking 31+ hours in over the past 4 days I can say I'm pretty hooked with the feel of combat, the massive skill trees, unique crafting system, solid story-line, artwork, etc.  (And yes, I'm playing in online mode, which has worked relatively well for me).

There's a reason the game is getting so much attention - because it's great and everyone knows it.  All you're seeing is a bunch of immature children who are angry their new game has had launch issues.

The Devs are active on Discord working to resolve the online/multiplayer issues and have had both progress and setbacks.  They are responding to the negativity with professionalism.

If it didn't have constant glitches and bugs impacting the core game loop, it might be a good game, but as it is, the developers seem to be expending every effort to advertise the game through sponsorships on YouTube and Twitch rather than funding their ongoing development. Issues that have plagued the game for the entirety of its early access phase still haven't been addressed - from 10+ second loading screens between every zone to hanging disconnects where the whole game just stops responding to abilities just deciding to fire off in random directions because they're colliding with the environment in ways they aren't supposed to, the game just lacks basic functionality that a 5-year-old game should have. At this point, I don't see these problems ever getting addressed, and I can't recommend a game that just feels so bad moment-to-moment.

The community also sucks, people genuinely asking for help are just told to push ctrl-G to read the game manual that is frequently missing information - most class mechanics and item mechanics are completely missing from the game, so if you want to know what Fire Aura does your only way of finding out is resorting to poorly maintained 3rd party websites. If you talk about a problem with the game in global chat, you'll get harassed with whispers from people telling you to go play Diablo 4, even if you don't mention anything about other games.

I'll try to keep a running list of bugs every time I log out over the next few days:

Passives that are active when you respec get stuck until you log out and back in.

Logging in often fails, it can take several minutes just to start the game.

Once you are logged in, loading into a new zone takes at least 30 seconds, the longest I've had to wait was over 3 minutes.

Sometimes the game will just hang on loading screens, so you have to force quit and go through the log in process again, at which point you zone in to a zone that will require at least 2 loading screens to resume the campaign.

Floor textures in later campaign acts will sometimes fail to load, so you'll end up walking on an invisible floor in an area that clearly shouldn't have invisible floors.

Runemaster class bugs:

Sometimes skills will fire in directions they aren't supposed to, the most common bug with this is Trinity Of Elements firing one or more of the beams in the same direction as one of the other beams when cast using the passive that leaps your character forward. 

Explosions on-screen will often occur on the server in a different place than you're actually seeing them, so they will look like they would do damage but they're actually missing your enemy. This became more noticeable whenI was against bosses when the abilities weren't one-shotting the enemy with overlapping spells.

New Bugs (Day2)

Players reporting offline characters are being deleted when the game updates - I didn't experience it myself, but with one of the main talking points being ""at least you can play offline"", I think it's more than fair to note this.

Endgame zones sometimes don't generate an objective - this means they can't be completed and you have to teleport out and reset it. Because of the design of these endgame systems, you lose 1 of 3 buffs from your previous zones, and you have to rebuild it after completing 3 more zones because they build over time through each zone completed without leaving or dying.

I seem to be chat banned? Not sure if chat is broken or if I was banned for talking about the game being buggy, but I definitely didn't say anything inappropriate, just basic criticism of the game and that the community should analyze games equally, not treat Last Epoch with kid gloves just because fewer people worked on it. My best guess is several people blocked me and triggered something that auto-bans people from chat if multiple people block them. At worst? The devs looked at the chat logs and decided to ban me because they don't want people criticizing their game. I don't want to think that's what happened, but there's either an inability to properly monitor their global chat or a maliciousness, and either makes for a pretty crappy experience. Edit, Apparently this is a bug that has existed since at least 2020. I tried to do some digging, there have been hundreds if not thousands of bug posts about it on their forums. The devs just don't care to fix it.

Sometimes health bars above your echo (map) boss's head just don't show up, so you can't tell if it's the enemy you need to kill to complete the echo or if you're just fighting a normal rare enemy.

Waypoints in the endgame system will sometimes just not work, so you have to spend several minutes walking to do your maps.",1708688532,1708805016,False,5,0,0.499473899602890015,0,True,False,False

The ""real,"" old review.

This game has pretty quickly evolved into one of the best ARPGs on the market. Tired of PoE or waiting for  the new league? Want something faster than Grim Dawn? Diablo 2 feels a little bit stale? - This is the game for you. Not to say that it is just the next best thing after those other ARPGs.

Combat - it could be better on some classes, Rogue being the smoothest class by far (it really does feel reeally good to play it), but we already know that they are working on overhauling other classes.

Skills and Passives - the passive tree is deep enough to have a plethra of choices for builds. The Skill leveling system is amazing, this is what D3 wishes it was - not too complicated, yet you could build each skill 3-5 completely different ways, combine that with multiple skills and sub-classes - you got a ton of variation for each class.

Items - more or less the usual ARPG stuff, but the crafting system makes sure that you can get the item that you need, you can just craft the affixes that you need on the base that you want. It is not that simple, as you add instability to your gear that way and can lock up or damage the item in the process, but the system as a whole is great tbh. Uniques, well, they are uniques, they have some modifier that a rare item can't have, more or less specific build enablers and whatnot.

Visuals - the game looks great, gives me enough old-school vibes, yet looks fresh and pretty.

Sound - leaves a little bit to be desired, could have more impact and weight behind skill sounds, but that also might be fixed in the future.

Overall, would say that the game is a good 7.5/10 that also has the potential to become a 9/10 in the nearest future. And I am quite sure that it will.

The game has a lot going for it, but very much is still in need of work and the fact they are calling it a 1.0 release is kind of insulting as the game still doesn't have its main story finished, as they only have 9 out of 12 chapters finished and the story still has a lot of placeholder art for NPCs, seemingly placeholder voice lines that don't match the text, and the fact it goes ""Here's the big bad... but this is the end of the chapters we have, go do the end-game Monolith of Time now"" is a slap in the face.  I'm glad they finally added all the class masteries but this is more of a 9.5 then anything.

Onto the things I do really like about the game.

The crafting system is easily one of the best I've seen.  Collecting shards, runes, and glyphs and being able to go ""I like the stats of this item but I can't use it... imma disassemble it and use the stats on a piece of gear I can"" is awesome.  I love finding items in shops or from a boss that's missing one stat and just being able to craft it is something I wish I could do in other ARPGs.
The Skill System is great.  Each skill has an entire skill tree associated with it allowing you to tweak skills to fit your play style.  Being able to play as a Necromancer and either focus on a few, super beefy minions or have a variable army to a million weak minions for the sole purpose of having suicide bombers or to turn them into one massive beast is neat as you aren't pigeonholed to just one specific play style.
Itemization is easy to understand as you can basically just look at your skills, what they scale with, and just go ""I want those stats"" and look specifically for them.
Speaking of stats... the loot filter is one of the best as well as you can create up to 75 specific rules to look for specific items with specific stats for specific classes and it's fun to figure out and once you do and know what you want to look for, just create the rule and go.  They can even be imported into other classes with ease.
The faction system they added is quite fun too.  I love the RNG one where you select ""prophecies"" which are tasks that, when completed, shower you in loot which feels nice.  The second faction is a bazaar which is good for people who like trading... I don't though so the first one is perfect for me.

Now the things... not so great.

Again, the story isn't finished despite it being the 1.0 release.  We're at chapter 9 of 12 so we don't have a resolution to the, fairly nonsensical, story and are basically told ""It's over, go into the end game grind"" which is the Monolith of Fate.  I don't mind the Monolith to much, as it's a simpler form of Maps from Path of Exile, but just... the fact the game stops and then tells you to do it that I'm not a fan of.
Due to this, you don't really care about any of the characters.  A lot of jumping around in time, a lot of these that happen for seemingly no reason and just ""happen"" so you'll fight a boss, suddenly cutscene about the boss dying, suddenly in a new time period with no reason as to why as there was no portal or lead up just boss dead, new time.
Skills, while featuring great customization, don't have the ""Oomph"" or audio feedback so outside of a few instances, none feel super impactful while being used so not all of them FEEL great, even if they are pivotal to your play style.

Some things I would like to see added.

Male/Female option for every class.  Currently each class is a specific gender but I would like to have options like a female mage (please make it an old woman, tired of seeing mages as old men and young women) and Male Acolyte.
More dungeons/arenas as there is only 3 plus and arena which feels a little low.
Finish the story so we have a resolution since we're in 1.0.

Overall, I do like the game and do recommend it despite its flaws.  It is a nice middle of the road ARPG where it's more complex then Diablo 4 but not as much as Path of Exile while having its own things that makes it great such as the crafting system but it needs polishing and finishing.",1708802986,1708802986,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""We’ve scale tested for months with third parties, consultants, the help of infra providers, and our own backend team.

From the extensive testing we’ve done, unless we do have a really crazy turnout, we should be stable. It’s not lost on us that many much larger companies than us have had issues at launch though... We’re optimistic and if there are issues it certainly won’t be for lack of effort, spend, or ignorance to the importance of launch day."" - Judd (Game Director)

So, that was a lie. Four days later, and still massive server problems.

Original - STILL STANDS:
Not a fan of the direction the game is going at the moment. I'll continue wishing for something more like PoE and less like Diablo.

The biggest problem? EVERYTHING is locked down. From animations, to maps (there are no map skips via movement skills), to items, to build interactions.... Items are actually the most egregious problem. I found myself struggling to make endgame builds that actually rely on dynamic use of unique items/skills. Not because they don't exist... but because the items that could be used are far too limited.

I'm here to exploit the game for my amusement. I want complex interactions. I want to spend hours building characters before ever playing the game. I can't have that here, and I don't really see it happening until the developers RELAX a little. Make an item that can be exploited. Let people have fun with it, and change it later. Do it.

That said, the devs have been communicative and the game is still playable, both in offline mode as well as online mode with (a decent bit) of patience.  

All the above considering, I started playing about 1 month prior to launch as an avid aRPG van. I played through the campaign once on each of the main classes and took my fave to Empowered Monoliths corruption 150 (early endgame).  The game offers a ton of fun options for killing hordes of monsters, and pretty fun endgame boss designs (nothing quite as epic as PoE's ubers, but still pretty fun). 

From what I've seen from the changes from pre-launch to 1.0, the game is even better now than it was prior to launch. The new masteries (subclasses) (currently playing through Warlock) are thematic, powerful, and interesting.  Additionally (loading screens aside) the game runs smoothly and graphics have improved since a month ago.  

Please, ignore the constant review bombing.  The servers are struggling true, and if they continue to lead to disruptive gameplay in a few days, i'll be sure to update this review/revise recommendation, but if you want a good, modern aRPG this is the easiest one for me to recommend to newcomers (we all know PoE is a bit daunting).

UPDATE FROM DAY 4: Loading times between town and non-towns are still longer than desired during peak hours. Developers still active in giving updates to the community.  Still hoping for load times to be normalized soon. Been able to play without interruption once loaded to the Monoliths without any issues so am starting the empowered monolith gameplay. (Warlock is incredibly fun)

The servers are pretty pretty messed up ATM for launch, but I am sure they are working on it and most likely by the time you are reading this they have it all ironed out.(Hopefully)

I'm not going to try and sell you the game, the truth is... I don't care if you buy it or not... But, I will tell you why I enjoy the game and the few things I don't.
1.The game looks and feels great.
There are enough different bioms that you don't feel like your just running back and forth on the same color gradient for the entire game
Playing the game feels good, Every thing about the combat is just next lvl for an arpg; The enemies look slightly different depending on how ""strong"" they are, most of the abilitites that I have used have great sound effects and animations, and heck the enemies even have different death animations depending on how you kill them.
2.The crafting is great. It might seem confusing at first, but once you understand how to use the UI and how shattering works everything else is just common sense.
3. The loot filter being in the game is great. This one might be a bit confusing and I do often run into things that i want to do but just can't because of the way it's designed.(Mostly just convience things though) for example If I want to make a lvling filter for armor pointing out only base items with certain aspects. Then have multiple different base items. It can be done... But, it's a mess. I have to make five different rules... one for each armor slot.
4.The stash is just AMAZING. It has a search bar... Enough said. Oh, it also doesn't cost real money to expand.
ATM the endgame is pretty... meh... honestly once I hit empowered monoliths I am usually wanting to roll another character, so I haven't even experienced ""All The Game Has To Offer"" like; the different dungeons, climbing the arena leader boards, the faction system, or high end monolith farming. Well, I have done a little bit of all of it, but that's the point... It feels Kind of stale pretty quick to me.
Uh... Performance... yeah... I have a pretty good p.c. and don't run into many problems. I will say the different areas have different baselines, but they will stay at those baselines. For example in town I get capped frames of 244, in the fire area I'll get like a steady 90-120, in a void area I'll get like 144-160, etc. Some Skills do Murder my fps consistently as well... sooo LOL. If your a 60 FPS GAMER then your more than fine. I'm also running at 2k resolution so if your a 1080P gamer you should be fine.(relative to your hardware)

TLDR: Even though I don't really play the endgame much, don't usually play with other people, server issues, and run into performance issues from time to time I still think the game is worth the base price of (currently) 35 USD...

I have 7.2 hours played, so says steam, but I have only really played the game for about 45 minutes, what I played felt between good to fine, but with over six hours of frustration and boredom this has had a big effect on my very negative views of this game.

I am currently giving up on this game, I may check back in a few days to see if it is any better, but I feel so deflated about this experience that im not sure I will even bother, I may just request a refund from steam.

Come on devs, how hard is it to do proper load testing of a game before you release it, very poor, very poor.

1. Server disconnects and general stability.
2. Quests not registering or no ability to reset quests.
3. Accurate math and causation to abilities procing or working with all the buffs from builds and gear. Feels like some stuff isn't working.
4. Clipping into objects and incomplete graphics. (this has changed drastically since beta)

Overall this is a very promising installment to the world of ARPG. I have played 15+ of them recently and this one seems to have the most endgame contributions. It says a great deal about how the ARPG world is always plagued by yes, having a storyline but then not supplying a healthy endgame to work with its longevity.

1. Diablo
2. PoE
3. Grim Dawn

Now, Diablo 4 is a mess, but so is the monstrous behemoth that is Activision Blizzard and its eternal pursuit of profit at any cost. Gone are the halcyon days of Diablo 2.

PoE? Well, if Diablo 4 is a mess, PoE is a F2P hoarder's house filled with old Excel spreadsheets.

Grim Dawn is a good off-brand substitute, but even it falls short of the original genre masters, Diablo and Diablo 2.

Enter Last Epoch, an ARPG that almost reaches those original ARPG heights. The gameplay loop is satisfying, the class building is varied without feeling overwhelming and the loot! Yes, the loot is there and it, too, is satisfying. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the title of ARPG champion bestowed upon the original D2 still remains out of reach, but Last Epoch makes for a better offer than other currently available options. Where it fails is largely down to the tightly-scoped world building of D1/D2 being subbed out for vast time travel hijinks and a release marred by a very conservative playerbase estimate that has left the development team scrambling to maintain the necessary infrastructure to handle the unending stream of players.

I'm loving this game.  The build diversity is so massive it's almost hard to choose what to play!  I played Lich with a huge frost mage during beta and been pushing a Falconer to 100 since launch.  It is such a different style of play than the first but still very fun.  

The game is approachable.  It is simple on the surface enough that you can just start playing without a build guide for a league start or something.  Deep enough that you can spend your time chasing after perfect crafts. Rarely do you completely brick anything and there is only one singular choice you cannot change, your mastery.  

When you decide you want to do your own build it is not hard to sort out the mechanics and figure out how to scale things because the info is right there for you to read.  In the in game guide, on the skill trees and on items you have all the details you need. External tools can be helpful for planning but are not strictly necessary like some other ARPGs.  Show out to Last Epoch Tools though, fantastic resource.

The launch has been a bit rocky but not enough they deserve obvious review bombing.  If you enjoy the game I highly suggest leaving a good review.  I've never seen any online game smoothly launch and I've been playing them going back to the early days of NWN on AOL and I've worked in IT for nearly 30 years.  The vast majority people talking about ""normalizing bad launches"" or think that throwing servers at a problem somehow magically fixes it.  Or that you can properly stress test an environment like this somehow, which is flat crazy if you know anything about enterprise architecture.

What is important is they have been highly responsive to feedback.  They are constantly communicating and the servers are better and better day by day, hour by hour.  I realize that can be frustrating.  I humbly suggest that if it is so frustrating you have to turn into a vile person to communicate that rudely, then you are probably not the type of person who should play any game on launch.

The rest of us will keep playing and enjoying ourselves.  Shout out to EHG for being so tolerant in discord of some truly hateful rhetoric and still engaging despite that.",1708800447,1708800447,True,4,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought the game in 2019  - pretty close to when it came out
I have several lvl 100 chars and several 85+
I saw the development of it and almost everything made it better, some of my builds were nerfed but then i got again into it and created a new build - and it made as much fun as before if not more
No other game to me is as much incentivizing going for several chars and subclasses as last epoch
I tried out several oscillating builds, single target hard hitting builds, screen clearing builds, minion builds and the best thing of it all - almost any class can do that as the other one but in a different way and therefore it feels different and i enjoyed all of it (obviously minion builds and a few other excaptions are excluded by that)
Respeccing the build is not punishing at all - so i tried out the subclasses in several ways and end builds
And the skill system in which you can modify a spell to a different version of the spell that has nothing to do with the initial one is marvellous

10 out of 10 for me

I ran into a complete game breaking bug where the main story cannot be progressed since the portal to activate mastery cannot activate. Made 3 attempts over 2 days before I gave up. When you introduce bugs in the 1.0 launch that prevent story progression 3 hours in, that's when I have to walk away from the game. This game breaking issue was not present in .92 beta.

It's very interesting to compare the launch experience of Helldivers 2 to Last Epoch. Both are similarly sized companies. Helldivers managed to fix most problems for 400k+ players in 2 days. Compare that to Last Epoch where online is still broken for 100k players and no root cause has been identified outside the API authentication issues on day 1 which was only the first domino that needed fixing.

LE-61 is Last Epoch's version of the Diablo 3 error 37 launch debacle.

+ Respeccing in this game is very easy which allowed me to explore different builds without it feeling punishing like in PoE.
+ The skill trees are interesting giving enough build variety but they could be bigger.
+ The Observatory makes SSF more fun to play.
+ Leader boards for endless arena is cool.
+ Picking up crafting mats with one click is nice QoL.

+- Why can't I change my mastery class? I think this should be an option for a cost.
+- The difficulty of the game feels too easy, I made my own build and struggled with nothing except for the first time facing Lagon. But getting my resistances capped made that easy as well.
+- The 3 dungeons the game has to offer are decent and unique but not really challenging, they don't really fill the spot of a big check for you to see if your build is good (completed tier 1-4 0 corruption as of writing this). They only fill the spot of making legendary items, gambling for items and loot. 

- Absolutely terrible launch experience. I'm used to terrible launch experiences (classic wow 8 hour log in queue etc) but the fact that they still have the same server issues as at launch multiple days in is unacceptable.
- Some skills I used bugged my characters animation causing my character to effectively stun himself until I spammed another skill. I was playing a sentinel and this happened mostly with my mobility skills. This happened all the time with the javelin skill with surprise initiative. If there was some terrain in the way of between me and my javelin it would still allow me to jump to it but cause me character to get stuck in the animation.
- Ranged mobs can shoot trough objects that should clearly give line of sight. wtf?
- The game play loop when you reach monoliths gets tedious quick. It comes down to loot filtering the stats that you need for your build. Picking those items up only so you can shatter them later. But during my time doing monoliths (done around 200+ as of writing this) I couldn't sustain the shattering runes with how much gear I was finding. Which meant I had to buy the shattering runes from the vendor every time his stock would refresh, this whole process became extremely tedious after about 50 monoliths.
- Doing monoliths only the objective matters because getting into the higher tier monolith gives more rewards. So the entire game play loop became rush objective in 1-3 minutes, portal out, do the terrible shattering system, go next monolith. And maybe every 50 monoliths an item would drop that was actually an upgrade or worth crafting. This game play loop is extremely shallow with very little variety. You have the quests for each monolith which changes the objective from: ''defeat waves of enemies, kill the boss or kill enemies until the boss/ambush comes. To talk to this npc, pick up x of this item. Not very interesting game play. And the last boss would always be a completely trivial boss battle. Nothing more then a PoE map boss, nothing epic like searching exarch, eater, shaper etc.
- The Bazaar trading UI could use some more QoL options. Not being able to sort by reputation rank or idol size is annoying.

 There is a fully offline mode, so you Could play even though the servers are down, however, you cannot take an offline character online, so any progress you make doesn’t really matter. 
 ALSO, anything you Buy with Real money, cosmetics, Can Not be used in Offline mode. This makes absolutely no sense to me. So, if you bought the big deluxe editions, and can’t play online due to their bad servers, then you are stuck offline and can’t even see or use any of your fancy cosmetics. Terrible design that punishes people for wanting to play alone. 
 Additionally, many of the quests at the beginning of the game are bugged. They will not be fully complete, so they will stay active on your mini map and quest log, even though you turned them in already. This creates an annoying experience when trying to follow real quests. I could see that maybe happening with a late game quest that was overlooked, but these quests are at the beginning of the game. 
 The rebinding of keys does Not fully work, half the time it gives you an error when trying to change the key binds for keyboard and for controller. I’m not sure why they even added the feature when it doesn’t fully work, did they not fix or pay attention to anything in the 5 years of early access? Maybe give them another 5 years at this rate to iron out the game.

LE is a reasonably solid ARPG that has some cool new features but some areas where some ideas were likely better left in the hypothetical space. If you REALLY want a new ARPG to play right now LE is worth the grab - otherwise, waiting until cycle/season 2 or for a sale may be a wise decision.

PROS:
• Combat feels good - abilities are impactful and smoothly executed (at least early on)
• Replayability - the time travel shtick works quite well for a game that should scale almost indefinitely
• Decent class design/class identity
• Performant - For a game this ""new"", FPS is quite solid with legacy hardware (GTX 660 min? what year is it?)
• Great UI - snappy, intuitive, and looks good all at the same time
• Beautiful in-game environments, and in general, a nice looking game

CONS:
• Network issues - for the moment expect long load times, rubber-banding, transition/scene failures and sporadic downtime.
• Ability respec - This is badly flawed. The potential to encounter a situation where you de-specialize too many skills at a high level and can no longer effectively kills mobs any longer (until you grind the skills back up to a higher level) does exist. The provided skills to catch up at higher levels are not enough to save you from some ""valleys"" of under-performance (very much so past level 30).
• No character customization - missing because the team is either too cheap, lazy, or incompetent to implement this. IMO totally inexcusable given the amount of effort for all of the other features.
• Item forging - this is a needlessly convoluted item augmentation system. While I can appreciate turning otherwise trash items into something useful, being able to whip a forge out of my ass to pull shards out of a breastplate just doesn't make sense and is annoying to boot. Just copy Diablo 3!

Ultimately, Last Epoch feels a bit undercooked. I would have been happy to wait longer and even pay a higher price for a better quality experience with some character customization.",1708798437,1708798600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mostly because i don't want to comeback and change this review down the line.

3 simple words... I love it.

As a disabled player with only 1 good arm and doctor set click limit.
Im thankful EHG had the foresight to put disabled friendly builds in.
They have multiple classes that can run one button / walking sim / Auto Bomber builds

They have no bubblegum currency, by using gold your not dependent on RNGeebus dropping you that widget you needed 3 acts ago.

Your not even forced to do the campaign if thats your thing.
There is a legitimate alternate path you can do instead using dungeons.

You can tell this game was made by gamers for gamers

Reviews went from down from ""very positive"" because of server issues since launch.

Right now you will have problems playing an online character because the servers are overrun with over 200.000 people trying to get in at the same time.

But you can play offline, test out all the classes, different builds for the classes etc.

I bought D4 and was done with it after 2 weeks or so. I bought this game 2 1/2 years ago and seeing the development was amazing. The devs actually listen to the community, are very communicative and come up with great new ideas for the genre (the way they solved the old ""trading yes or no"" discussion for example).

Buy it now and enjoy offline until servers are fixed, or wait a little until the servers are fixed if you only want to play online.

I'm quite surprised how much more I enjoy this game now that I turned *off* all of the voiceovers. I actually hadn't realized just how *annoying* the random, stupid, *repetitive* voice exclamations by every random NPC were until they just weren't there any more. In general, I think the voiceover work in this game is not very good. Good riddance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, in between the first time I tried Last Epoch and now, the game has improved significantly. The NPCs with trite, nonsensical filler voice lines that do not match what the dialog in front of you says still annoys the crap out of me. The story is still on rails (at least for the campaign portion, that is). But the actual *playing* of the game is very good. The loot filter system is excellent, and the game actually has a crafting system that I *LIKE*, rather than detest or merely tolerate. The skills and passives progression are excellent, and meaningful.

I think I'll play some more now...

My original review, from much earlier in the beta: 

Sluggish response and graphics, story on rails, UI full of gobbledegook, NPCs full of trite nonsensical filler dialog...

Played this game in early access and im about 15ish hours in 1.0.... The amount of change is incredible. I'm 
not gonna lie i was very worried on how 1.0 was gonna turn out based off of what we had in 0.9, but it was well worth backing EHG. 

Game is highly polished, and provides good challenges. Honestly the best hybrid of POE and Diablo 2. Has a good amount of complexity without being over bearing. Unique items allow for highly unique playstyles. And while, yes there are 'meta' builds (stat efficient), This game has always done a good job of allowing the player to adjust skillsets/passives to fit their playstyle regardless of class. This essentially allows you to cater to your own playstyle and allows for creativity. 

EHG has done a fantastic job on keeping people updated through the 1.0 growing pains (insane on how much traction this game got in the last 2 weeks). Never have I experienced a Studio so invested in their community to the point of just giving updates as soon as they know something.

They've been putting out fixes for an incredibly difficult problem to solve at great speed, but most players wouldn't recognize it. I have confidence that the online issues will eventually be fixed.

As for the game itself, it's been one of my favorite, if not my absolute favorite ARPG to be released so far. The builds and customization options are incredibly diverse and the skill upgrade system is uniquely entertaining. Combat is very satisfying, and abilities feel very impactful. The skill tree system is not as overly simplistic as Diablo's but also not as convoluted and punishing as PoE's. The crafting system is amazing, and makes it much easier to get items that you need, yet keeps the feeling of finding upgrades rewarding. The trade system could use some bits of refinement, but is an overall great improvement to that of their competitors'. However, if you are not into trade, there is also an alternative option to not have to deal with it and boost drop rates instead. There's a lot more good that could be said about how this game has taken all the best (and worst) parts of ARPGs and improved upon them. 

There's also a true offline option where the whole experience is very smooth, which is an absolute rarity in the modern gaming world with every recent release being a ""game as a service"".

Edit 24-02-2024: 
Changed from a positive review to a negative one and here's why:

The fact that this company has severe connection and back-end issues for 4 days in a row is just a meme at this point. Apparently, looking at the forums, this was mentioned in feedback topics many times over, even with only 3-6k CCU. Yet, it seems they've never truly addressed it, and now the problem is exacerbated.

There are also stories going around that the company can't scale horizontally fast enough and had to buy servers. It seems unfortunate in this day and age, but if that's true... I really hope you hire a solid technical/cloud architect and some better operational back-end engineers. But I guess the problem is more complex than that.

So, yeah, once again: if you can play, it's a beautiful freakin' game. I really love every minute I played. If they fix these issues, we have 2 amazing titles to play throughout the year: PoE and LE :-)",1708563333,1708796520,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It seems like you can make a large variety of viable builds with each class/mastery, so finding something that matches your desired playstyle should be fairly easy.  Originally, I wanted to be a Necromancer, as I love minion classes in ARPGs.  I played it a bit, and it felt great, but I didn't feel exactly like what I wanted.  Switched to Beastmaster and it's exactly the feel I wanted.  Me and my minions, ballz deep in melee combat, leaping from pack to pack just laying waste to anything in our way.  Having a great time leveling so far.

Could 1.0 launch have gone better?  Yeah, the dev didn't account for the massive influx of players with 1.0.  Day one server issues happen.  Sometimes it takes a few days to perfect things.  I'm not a patient man, and I'm finding these issues to not be too big of an issue.  It helps that the devs are in constant communication with the community, explaining what they are doing to fix the issues and the fixes they are implementing are actually making a difference, so you know it's not just lip service.  You can play offline if you want to and avoid any server issues, but if you want to play online, go ahead.  It's not perfect yet, but I haven't experienced anything nearly as bad as what other people are saying they're dealing with, even on day one of 1.0.

For the price, this game offers tons of content.  Honestly, it's probably under-priced and I'm likely to buy some unneeded cosmetics because I didn't overspend on the initial purchase price.  Try it if you like ARPGs.",1708796369,1708796369,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The Game.: 
Easy to Learn, Hard to Master ARPG/H&S with focus on Skills who u can Refine over time, even when u play with 3 people all playing the same Class and Mastery, all of them will have completely different Skillbuilds and Playstyles. 
The game itself was created over Reddit, then Kickstarter and after that CLOSELY with the community unlike other 
genre-representatives, not naming them! 
when the community dislike something, they change it and so on. 
To my Knowledge the Best Crafting/Trading and Adventuring System/ Lootfilter in the ARPG World, with great thought behind, but there are already some great Videos on that in youtube u can Watch :D. 


2. The Steam Community!!!!!!! 
the game is fallen 15% overall to 73% from over 88% (was the last i saw before launch) since launch and only dropped so low because people are having 0 understanding of Development, Even when u stresstest with TOOLS there are the real server load missing, and within the beta there where only 31k people max at some point, going nowhere near the 130k+ people at the start trying to go in at the same time to overlook the data because there where never this much to look over .... ! there where Other ""recent"" releases that had the same problem because they had 0 data to work with and where overstomped after launch and that will ALWAYS happen to indies..... because they don't have the money upfront like AAA Industrie who don't even care as long as they get ur money, THIS TEAM DOES, they are Communicating Everything since the beginning over the forums, sooooo instead of writing a negative review because ur little feelings are scratch, get a bandaid and look in the forums if the servers are stable or not... 

Once u get over a Certain threshhold, (130k+ at start, 230k+ at writing this review apperently Oo) they had 0 data if the infrastructure was going to hold, and to the time of this posting they already wrote in the forums they will use a different infrastructure to TRY to garantee to get better results for the online play. 

Oh and the Developer AND Puplisher is ELEVENTH HOUR GAMES ......... NOT TENCENT, they made a frikking Forum Post ... just search Tencent in the Last Epoch Forums on their website and they say what Tencent does and what not .... 
even when some Reviews here are telling u something different........ + tencent would be puplisher on this page and it isn't ....",1708796087,1708796087,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The storyline is meh and not the best thing ever which is also easy to gloss right over. The story is not a reason to play this game at all. If you want story or solid narrative, I would definitely give this a hard pass. It's there, but it seems secondary.

In the vast sea of action role-playing games (ARPGs), a new titan has emerged, standing tall with an aura of innovation, player respect, and sheer enjoyment that radiates from its core. Last Epoch is not just a game; it's a revolution in the ARPG genre, masterfully weaving together the essence of classic gameplay with groundbreaking features that cater to both newcomers and veterans alike. This review delves into the myriad reasons why Last Epoch is not merely a game but an unforgettable experience that reshapes our expectations of what an ARPG can be.

[h2]A Promise of Adventure and Respect[/h2]
From the outset, Last Epoch greets players with a promise – a promise of adventure, depth, and a respect for the player's intelligence and time that is often glossed over in today's market. Unlike its contemporaries, it strikes a perfect balance between accessibility and depth, ensuring that players do not need a PhD to enjoy its complexities, nor will they find their intelligence insulted by oversimplification.

[h2]Community and First Impressions[/h2]
The journey into Last Epoch begins with trepidation for many, influenced by the cacophony of ultra-negative voices that often dominate online discourse. However, a deeper dive into the community, particularly the vibrant discussions on their Discord, reveals a starkly different narrative. Here lies a game beloved, with players reporting minimal issues despite extensive playtimes, a testament to the game's stability and the developers' commitment to a seamless experience.

[h2]The Evolution of Gameplay[/h2]
As players venture beyond the initial plains, the world of Last Epoch unfurls with breathtaking beauty, intricate sound design, and a deep, engaging gameplay that hooks you beyond the mere hours. The graphics transition from mundane to magnificent, the sound effects immerse you in its universe, and the skill trees and classes unveil a depth of customization and strategic play that is nothing short of brilliant.

[h2]A Developer Who Cares[/h2]
At the heart of Last Epoch is a developer who is one of our own – a nerd driven by passion rather than corporate greed. This is a game designed with a profound respect for the player, evident in every facet from the fair pre-order bonuses to the rejection of paid power items and DLCs. Every decision, every feature, speaks of a pro-consumer ethos that is refreshingly rare in today's gaming landscape.

[h2]Innovations and Quality of Life Improvements[/h2]
The game redefines convenience with features like one-click inventory sorting, an intuitive loot filter, and a crafting system that respects the player's time and effort. The dread of inventory management, the clutter of unidentified items, and the hassle of crafting materials are all addressed with elegant solutions that allow players to focus on what matters most – the adventure.

[h2]Flexibility and Depth[/h2]
Last Epoch also champions flexibility, allowing players to respec their characters without punitive restrictions, liberating them from the fear of permanent choices. This freedom extends to trading and farming, with thoughtful mechanics that encourage a healthy game economy and community interaction.

The depth of Last Epoch is staggering, from the skill trees that allow for unprecedented customization to a crafting system that empowers players to create their unique gear. The game even addresses common ARPG grievances with innovative solutions that enhance gameplay without compromising challenge or enjoyment.

[h2]A Commitment to Accessibility and Enjoyment[/h2]
Moreover, the game’s commitment to an accessible yet deep experience is showcased in its user-friendly in-game guides and tooltips. These features, along with lightning-fast world transitions and a bug-free online experience, underscore the developers' dedication to quality and player satisfaction.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Last Epoch is not just a game; it's a testament to what happens when developers listen, care, and innovate with the player in mind. It dethrones legends, challenges norms, and sets a new benchmark for what an ARPG should be. With its compelling story, rich gameplay, and unwavering respect for the player, Last Epoch is the beacon of the genre, illuminating the path forward for others to follow.

After finally alleviating it to a degree (-it's not fully resolved yet-), the game is now somewhat playable.

Now that I'm able to actually play it, I'm realizing its not much fun. Atleast not $50(CAD) fun.
((Maybe $25? So if it's on-sale when you read this, then it might be worth it.))

The skill system at first, yes is fun. But then you realize that if you want to try different things, the penalty is loss of a skill point on every reset of the skill tree... Then you begin to realize the skill system, despite being able to edit how the skill functions to a fair degree, doesn't exactly have meaningful change. At least not without having an entire set of armor and weapons to work with that particular skill. Meaning this game is very much going to become a, ""Look Up A Build Online"" sort of game. Which immediately negates the entire ""freedom"" of being able to adjust your skills to your own play-style. That or do the Freedom thing, but have to spend hours upon hours regaining lost skill points.

I'm reminded of a game with similar skill editing to Last Epoch but does it in a different way. The game Undecember, despite having some monetization flaws, does in-fact do what Last Epoch is attempting to do, but much better. Not to mention the boss fights are actual boss fights. Last Epoch's boss's are pathetic. To sum it up, it's just a larger trash mob with more health. So if your looking for challenging gameplay Last Epoch is simply not.


General Gameplay - 5/10 [somewhat dull.]

Gameplay Loop - 4/10 [Feels like running in circles.]

Graphics - 6/10 [It's okay, although there are some really low quality skills rendered at a very small resolution that look they were just blown up in size, which makes them look really pixelated and blurry. There was one boss in particular that used a lightning skill, and a bud and I both started abruptly laughing at the same time, and both knew exactly why.]

Difficulty - 3/10 [You will honestly feel drowsy while playing this game. There really isn't much to keep you occupied other then reading skill definitions.]

Story - 3/10 [there are few interesting concepts. In general just about every cutscene has voice acting wasted on depicting what we are currently looking at.]

Music - 2/10 [Sounds like someone took the most annoying music from the Witcher 3, but replaced it with people screaming Vowels(yes vowels A,E,I,O,U are literally sung in the main menu) and sounds like it was all made in GarageBand...]

Audio Engineering - 3/10 [There are often distortions in various audio samples. From voices, to some of the music.]

Ambiance - 8/10 [Honestly the best part of the game. From various sounds monsters make, to creaking sounds of trees and various other environmental sounds. Probably the most well done aspect of the game.]

Quest Context - 2/10 [You will quickly find yourself wanting to skip through any text after awhile]

Would I recommend this game at regular price: No.
If this game was $19.99, absolutely, many of the issues can be overlooked at that price. At full asking price. Just no, not worth it IMO.

The devs are actually communicating about what is happening so we are not in the dark and if you got a bit of patience or are playing outside of peak times you can actually play quite well. Especially end game is stable since once you got a connection going in the end game system you stay on one server.

- Gameplay and combat does not feel good, one could argue that it should be expected from an indie company.
- Online servers are unplayable, even four days after the release, feels like Wolcen all over again. At least they have offline play, but then you're cut off from trading and so on.
- Story is boring, made even worse by the fact that you cannot change your mastery and you'll have to level all over through the boring campaign again (ye i know the game has fast tracks)
- Endgame is fairly good however, I do like the crafting system, being able to target specific stats farily easily and the ability to merge unique items with Exalted gear, better than what PoE has imo:

One other thing that I didn't like was that all characters are gender locked and cosmetic locked meaning you can't change their face or details.

Game starts slow and seems lame (especially in the initial hallway-esque zones), but it develops much more into what you would expect. The skill trees and spell customization is great and seems to offer a wide variety of builds (similar in design to Grim Dawn, with more focus on the spell customization trees). I haven't reached endgame yet but heard good things, so I won't speak to that.

In the game's current state, I wouldn't recommend it. There is a lot of zoning and the servers are horrible. Sometimes it will be fine and other times it will literally take 5-10 minutes to load a new zone, or it will crash on load entirely and you have to restart the game. At present, the servers are down.

Fun and fluid combat.  Cool bosses & mechanics.
A very customizable but intuitive skill system, (not PoE complex, but not D4 baby-mode).  
A good number of classes at launch.
An amazing crafting system that is easy to understand.

You are given a long time to appreciate them too, so you can get lost in the art design. The colour palette choices are exquisite and the context is very original. The refreshing image highlights the artists' vision on the game's world fully. You can find small hints from the game areas and be suprised (at least I think that's the case, since I haven't seen the game areas yet). Besides the art, you also get very useful hints and they really help a ton before you get to play the game you actually can imagine playing it with the small hints you are given. The font is chosen very professionally to make you read it so you can't miss it, and since there is a lot of time for you to read the hints you can actually memorize them for the rest of your adventure. The loading is shown on a diamond shaped icon and two sparks that chase each other in it, just like the people chasing each other to get an opening and log into the game, the metaphorical meaning is what makes me like the icon most.

If you wanna play with friends or side with the trade guild, just wait a couple more days to get the game. Server issues are temporary, the game beneath has been my favourite arpg for a while now after playing Poe, Grim Dawn and Diablo 3 extensively.
Sad to see recent reviews being mixed, but peoples' frustration is understandable.


A rising star on the arpg horizon - but it's still in beta, so it's far from perfect.

+Good balance between simplicity and depth

+ The pace feels nice, faster than Grim Dawn's, but slower than PoE's or D3's paces.

+ Classes feel unique and pretty much all skills feel relevant enough to potentially build around.

+ You can experiment and come up with functional builds on your own without following any guides or watching tutorials.

+ Detailed loot filter customization and a game guide for all sorts of topics integrated into the game.

+Overall cool devs, very communicative, healthy design philosophy and keeping up with their roadmap for releases of new content etc. so far.

+ Interesting deterministic crafting and the best item modifiers come from drops only and aren't craftable.
Edit: Crafting got completely reworked and is much more fun now with more options.

+- No multiplayer or trading yet. Irrelevant for singleplayer, but if you want to play with friends, you gotta be patient. EDIT: The recently presented trade/notrade concept in form of factions looks amazing on paper, we'll see how it's gonna turn out in the near future.

- Still not well optimized performance wise. If you have a lower end pc, you might get really low framerates in some areas. (also exclusive fullscreen has to be forced with steam's launch options). EDIT: A shitton of performance improvements and polishing of every department happened, game feels MUCH better now!

- In beta there's not too much content yet. There's the campaign, endless arena and 1 major endgame mechanic, the Monoliths.
At least 3 or 4 more endgame mechanics are planned before 1.0 launch.
Edit: The new dungeon is cool and monoliths got a bit better.

- Itemization is fun, but there aren't too many unique items or modifiers for some builds yet. More items and legendaries coming in the future.
Edit: Lots of new unique items and legendary items took itemization to another level!

Although the game was unplayable at launch I persist and continue to play the game. Yes, through all the disconnects, LE-61, etc. I rarely write reviews for games and this was my 2nd ever review (1st one was POE after 500 hours spend in the game). 

I love this game even when I realized that I wasted 4-5 hours looking at the loading screen. Day 3 was somewhat stable and I manage to finished the campaign. I'm currently level 83 in the game and will continue to play as frustrating as it may be. One of the many reasons why I try to login everyday simply because the devs have been absolutely amazing in keeping the situations as transparent as possible. They don't have to but they did, so credit where credit is due. Plus the gameplay is fun.

My takes:

1)""I can't login but here's an upvote"": I paid for the product that didn't work as intended therefore I cannot (in good faith) tell others to spend money only to be disappointed. If you say otherwise you need to touch grass more than I do. Would you recommend a shitty restaurant to your friends after a terrible experience? Hell no! If you do, well that's why we ain't friends.

2) Speaking of friends why are people treating the devs like you're the best of pals. You don't know these people. They ain't your friends. I'm a customer, I paid for the product and I expect it to work. It ain't that deep. Some of y'all treat it like I have it out for the devs. I don't give a fuck about the devs. If they fix the game I'll play if they don't then I won't.

3) ""Offline Mode exists"": It infuriating that people uses Offline Mode as an excuse for the product not working properly. I didn't buy the game to play in Offline Mode you dumbfuck. BTW, you cannot transfer offline to online, you cannot play with friends, you cannot use cosmetics. I don't want to masturbate by myself in offline mode. If you ain't circle jerking with your homies in 2024 what are you doing?

4) "" They're a small indie company give them a break"": Who cares? I hate comparing one company to another just because a larger company also struggles with the same problems. I was more than content to play 0.9.2. Its Why not use those big companies as an example to do better? Why not stress tests the server some more? Why brag about the sales and preparations only to failed the delivery? ""Look at HD2, D4 or POE launch"". I don't give a shit about their launched. I care about this game launch.

For example I was to use a gamepad that isn't detected as a controller and the Dpad has a thumbstick I can't use because the game does not have multi directional key binds for movement. 

I would also make it so map fog and enemies DO NOT respawn when using town portals.

Also add more character customization and ability to change gender/other options with some character creation.

Reviewed at time of patch 1.0 at release

[h1][Systems][/h1]
- Great crafting system, can add and remove afixxs off gear if they have enough forging potential, each change can decrease your forging potential and when its at 0 you can no longer craft more onto that item. You find ""Affix shards"" to be able to change your affix's throught killing monsters or using a ""Rune of Shattering"" on a item in the forge to get affix shards off a item that has affixes you want and sent to use with the crafting system.

- Crafting mats have their own space and infinite storage, The ones you find in the world will be in your inventory but theres a button to ""transfer crafting mats"" that will put them all into the infinite crafting storage for you from your inventory. What I do after a while is ""Transfer"" crafting mats then sort my inventory and continue blasting until a true full inventory.

- Has Idols a system similar to the Diablo 2 talismans and they don't take up inventory space, because they have their own slots,

- 200 Stash tab cap with tabs for categories, for example you can have a tab for idols and have 3 or 4 tabs under that that are the actual stash tabs.

- Game Modes: Softcore, Hardcore, SCF (Solo Character found, that character can only access loot that they have gotten), SAF (Solo Account Found, that character can access gear in the stash only from other SAF characters)

- Every skill has its own skill line tree, if you mess up a point allocation you have to respec the point, but it wont give it back immediately, you have to ""earn"" it back again through xp using the skill but its at a accelerated rate over the first time getting that skill point

- Each class has 4 mastery class passives, mastering a passive tree means you can fully allot passive points into that tree but the other non mastery skills (besides your base class) you can only put points into half those trees. (You can not change the mastery skill once you select it)

[h1][Endgame][/h1]
- Cant speak much on this yet as of the 1.0 patch as i haven't reached it yet, but from what I did play Pre 1.0 it had a system called ""monolith of fate"" which is like a bunch of maps you just go through with almost all of them having some sort of loot buff, for example ""15% ring drop rate"" or such. From what I've seen in 1.0 you can actually do them before you complete the campaign too.

- Dungeons: Haven't tried them yet
i think there is one more endgame system too in patch 1.0 but haven't tried it yet.

[h1][Making alts][/h1]
- From what I've read online is they have a unique system of skipping the campaign on alts, after a little campaign progression, you need dungeon keys from your main and you need to complete that dungeon on the alt in order to skip that part of the campaign. There is 3 dungeons in the game currently. While I haven't tried this yet I will eventually.


Yes there is server issues at launch, what new game doesn't in 2024, But what people don't talk about is that the online patch came out fairly recently at version beta 0.9.8 so it will take them time to iron out some issues, plus they probably weren't expecting as many players as they are getting either. As well as them being a small team comparatively to large AAA companies. the company only has about 90 developers, give them some time people they are working on it. Another game suffering from success in 2024.

It is bananas to me that you can leave a review without even breaking an hour or so.

Has the launch been great? Nah, but is it worth burying a dev in negative reviews for a game that could very well become a main stay in a genre starved for more?

No predatory in-game store. Only cosmetics.

Upon release it is impossible to play the game. Nearly impossible to connect to the game, If you're lucky enough to actually get in, the wait time for portaling or transitioning between zones takes minutes and will definitely break all party members up if playing with others.

 The designers of this game thought it would be a good idea to have lots and lots of very small zones with many loading transitions between them, then not address the fact that all those players zoning might overload the servers.

Braging about selling 1 million copies in steam (35 millions dolars) and CEO posting that they tested and ready for release, but this is the worst ARPG release ever.

For a problem that cursed this game for almost one year with less players, trying to solve in 4 days, it will never happen.

This is a true loading screen simulator, you will spend more time trying to connect or stuck between zones.

The solution? Devs told us to play off-line, however you can NOT transfer you progress into online and can NOT use any paid cosmetic in offline, not good at all.

The release trailer was wonderful, but the cut-scenes inside the game is not in the same level, it's bellow average.

The graphics had some improvements but it's same old cartoonish graphics with diferent contrasts, lighting, and more darker, it's a trick, looks better, but it's not a complete redesigned graphics as advertised.

The graphic performance is very low, not optimized, even if you have a powerful PC, full of glitches and FPS drops.

It's a very promissing game, should be a great game in a future, but at this moment, it's not ready for full release.

POE still the greatest ARPG of all time, D4 is more polished that LE.

I love the look and feel of D4 and a lot of the gameplay, at the same time that the basically Beta-stage of the game is frustrating almost to the point of being insulting. 

So when I say that I'm enjoying this game, I know that goes against the competition between the two games. I like the time travel thing -- it's confusing, but I'm digging getting a handle on it. The skills and combinations of skills are novel and fun, and the system for managing them -- unlike the bee pet referral system -- has clearly been thought through. Gameplay is pretty fluid, and you can take your time or buzz on through as it suits you. I haven't gotten to endgame, yet, but I am having a good time playing the campaign. As an Alt Addict, certifiable, I love the 25 character cap. Offline play option is also a big plus.

If I have a criticism, it's about the look and feel. Maybe it's not even a criticism, but a personal preference. One of the things I love about D4 is that visual vibe. I'd like for the game to feel a little less like a cartoon, visually speaking. That's the thing that put me off when I first started playing. But once I got about an hour in, I was having enough fun that it doesn't really bug me any more.",1708789998,1708789998,True,5,0,0.514925360679626465,0,True,False,False

And don't come with the ""oh this studio has its first time game release be patient bs.."" cmon, we live in a world where information is so easy to access and they had years to prepare based upon other companies cases, fails etc. 
- Servers were still down after 4-5 hours (*correction=4 days now online is unplayable!) of the kickstarter. 
- They did not allow downloading patch ahead of time only after the time they opened the servers (the servers lol which all crashed after 20 minutes..). - 95% of people who purchased bought for ONLINE game not for offline.
- They were not able to prepare for the player amount based on simple review of preorders game purchases... 
- They were only advising us to go ahead and play offline mode while they were waiting for the player numbers to reduce to keep up the servers, (meaning ur character and progression will remain offline and u gotta start all over again once online is back). 
- Long story short, apart from being patient, understanding etc... we paid for this game full price ffs, and they promised a server start at XX:XX time, we kept our side of barging, they did not. Simple.
- I wouldn't be here writing my rant if they would have at least said ""look guys, servers will be open on 21th but it most prob be unplayable for a day or so"". 
Then many of us would not organize their day only to be forced to observe the fundgin ""unable to connect"" pop up the whole night.

So all in all, because this is my first personal experience and impression with the game after purchasing it, my opinion so far is negative so I don't recommend it. 
But I will come back in a week or two and will change my rating if... I see more honest, equal, playerfriendly communication from dev/studio side and secondary if the game will be as good as it was initially promoted.

The review bombs do not reflect the quality of the game.   It's fantastic.  I've played ARPGs for 20+ years and this game gives me the vibes that nothing has been able to give me since Diablo 2.  The gear and loot is awesome, the crafting is awesome.  The variety of the builds you can play with the class and subclass system is so good.  There are so many options and so many things are viable.  Best part: it's finally a game that isn't predatory.  Cosmetics only for sale for micro transactions.

Game is fully playable at the 1.0 release. There's still some really glaring issues. One thing that's completely ruined my experience is incredibly long load screens. I'm running a 12th gen i9, I know it's not a local problem.
Assuming they'll get that figured out soon.
The game itself is ""good."" I think a lot of people are really singing its praises because it's not diablo 4. I like the story. It seems they've changed out some of their voice actors. Overall, it's a compelling and interesting story which is really the only thing that I can really recommend playing for. The game does ARPG well but there's nothing revolutionary here. It fits into its genre and doesn't progress it. So, how can I recommend this game over the dozens of other ARPGs? If you're like me, you've got that ARPG itch every couple years. Why would you scratch that itch with Last Epoch?

Its character development systems are good, fair amount of grind and complexity. End game is good and fun, too.

I've toggled from a No to a Yes simply because it's no longer a bad game. Big complaints are the long load times, sometimes failing to transfer from zone to zone (and there's A LOT of zone transfers), and the frankly flat multiplayer experience.

I think Last Epoch owes at least 3/4ths of its hypetrain to anti-Diablo sentiment and it's really not fair. Diablo 4 is not a bad game. Last Epoch has some significant advantages over D4 in some of its design features, namely character development, but D4 has some mechanical features that make it ""feel"" so much better than last epoch. The fluidity of movement and the visceral combat and action, the seamless open world, complete with open world events and bosses. Even PVP features... Diablo 4, while some of the RPG features are frankly flat, the overall game is much better than last epoch. For me, I'd rather play last epoch, but if someone was going to play one ARPG, only one, I'd send them towards Diablo 4 or PoE.

previous review:
TLDR: By the time this game is worth playing, it will be F2P with MTX, PASS

update: I'm still at a not recommend because they still don't have multiplayer and I'm seriously doubting their ability to technically pull it off.  However, if you're a big fan of ARPGs, you probably want to play this game.  I'd still say there's plenty of time to wait but you'll almost surely get your money out of it.  However, if you're not an ARPG fan I think there's a lot of better places to start in this genre, at least for the foreseeable future.

Very far from complete.  Lots of broken skills, lots of broken features.  Account issues, basic systems malfunctioning, crashes, graphical bugs.  overall, it's a paid alpha.  I usually recommend early access games, forgiving them for being incomplete, however, this is clearly a GaaS title.  If you're serious about a character builder ARPG, you probably want to do a lot of min/maxing and theorycrafting.  Whelp, this game is incomplete and/or broken in that regard.
Gameplay is clunky
Voice actors sound like modern millennials who aren't even trying to sound like legit voice actors.
In game, you're referred to as a player, so the RPG itself breaks the 4th wall
Skill trees are half-baked or just missing.
Everything you want in this game is either half implemented or not implemented.

Fun game when it works I suppose, but better working options exist.

Edit: 24 hrs post release and the problems still persist. No concrete update from the developer on when a fix will actually be ready/tested. The only communication is effectively we are working on it and ""seeing improvement."" Do not buy this game currently, wait for a heavy sale at best.

Edit 2: Going on four days post launch the server issues are still not fixed. If you manage to get online you will have disconnects, lag, and worst of all 10-20 minute loading screens between each zone which is bad for a game like this which is segmented into many, many, very small zones. You load all of that time for 10-20 enemies and a minute of content.

The devs have yet to give any sort of indication on when these problems will meaningfully improve and in fact are spending time talking about how to cook rice in the official discord as I type this. Do not buy this game, do not support this company, if I could refund at this point I would.

Edit 3: The devs are now actively ignoring people asking about problems or time for a solution, only responding to positive comments. For clarity, the problem has not improved since launch despite the company saying they are ""seeing improvements"" every day yet having to rollback the ""fixes"" they make.

The gameplay of this game is super polished and I really appreciate how the skill trees actually make an impact on your characters skills rather than just increasing a number on the screen like Diablo. Despite the server issues on 1.0 I am really enjoying the game and would now recommend it.

Yes, there are server issues shortly after release and no, that is not fair to the consumer.
The issues are dissappointing but I hope they will be fixed in the near future.

Now the evaluation of the Game itself:
This is an amazing Game. The Gameplay is smooth, the loot is diverse and it has a highly engagable crafting/gear altering system. It feels very satisfying to figure out different builds and gives the player a good feeling of discovering something new if a new piece of loot dropped that synergizes just right.
Last Epoch is a good pick up for different kinds of Players and is worthwhile for 20 but also for 100 hours and more.

After a bunch of playing I can't really recommend this game. I hate how most ARPGs have devolved into ""Hey you didn't notice that small ground effect? Welp, you're dead now"" type of game play. As a visually impaired person I'm not enjoying it at all.

These features collectively provide an experience that's hard to come by, captivating players with its intricacies and strategic depth. The game's ability to keep you hooked, experimenting with builds, and hunting for the perfect loot is a testament to its well-thought-out design and the developers' commitment to creating a compelling action RPG.

However, it's not without its issues, especially noticeable around the launch of 1.0. The excitement was somewhat dampened by server instability and matchmaking woes, problems that weren't entirely unforeseen given the long loading times experienced when partying up pre-launch. These technical setbacks have been a source of frustration for many, myself included, as they hinder what is otherwise a stellar gaming experience.

Despite these hiccups, the core of Last Epoch remains strong and enjoyable. If you can look past the server issues, which the developers are actively working to resolve, there's a rich and immersive world waiting to be explored.

No cutscenes, nothing interesting at all during the whole campaign.

Character controls and animations are stiff, slow and unresponsive. It plays like a game from the 90s when developers just started using 3D and couldn't create fluid animations.

This is far more approachable than POE I`m able to craft the questing is clear I can see the build possibilities have depth its complex but makes sense easy to understand but there plenty to master.
Boss fights are really fun its a good game over all the pace is decent.
The graphics and sound need a little work but its Beta the animations in combat could use a tweak so hit detection feels a little more  precise overall i`m having a good time and look forward to playing more.

Add to that some qol features that Last Epoch came up with or at least refined to a new gold standard (ingame loot filter, balance features between economy / solo self found, crafting system, offline mode) and Last Epoch is currently my favorite ARPG to play by a significant margin.
Downsides of the game as of the posting of this review are graphics inferior to the obvious competitors, especially in character models (which I dont care too much about, during gameplay of an isometric ARPG you couldnt pay attention to character details even if you wanted to), loading times that are just a tad too long for my taste (with me playing on a five year old PC), and a rough server performance right now during official 1.0 launch week.

Gameplay is smooth and is great to view. Spell effects and background are beautiful, but not distractingly so. Talent trees are fairly well thought out, although some redundancy is present, and respec costs points, so choose carefully and view all options before selecting. As advertised, the Necromancer is the closest to a true ideal than almost any game of recent memory. 

However, to be blunt, who releases a game without spellchecking it first? I am going to make a drinking game out of every time the lich in Welryn Undercity says ""sancturary"". Is this Scooby Doo's undead form, and if so, does that make Shaggy a warlock?

The game presents as a comfortable remake of Diablo III. Characters have limted skills that they can specialize (rune) up, monster packs with affixes are ""elites"", and there are Shrines that give strong effects (crit, move, even gold). No treasure goblins, though. Boss encounters are mechanics based, and fun to learn.

Sound effects for combat and interactions are satisfying and provide good feedback, which is crucial in intense battles.

Performance and Technical Aspects:

""Last Epoch"" runs smoothly for the most part, with Eleventh Hour Games regularly releasing updates that introduce new content as well as optimizations and bug fixes.

Its a good game, for sure.  However, the end game content is extremely lacking.  Its basically PoE map system, over and over.  There is not a lot of complexity to it or intricacies to it at all.  However, I know that they will add more to the game to do at late game, and when they do I will HAPPILY change my review to a recommended.  Right now I just cannot justify recommending a game that costs 35 bucks for roughly 40 hours of game play, when at least 10 of that is gonna be very repetitive.

Edit (2/24/24): The devs are incredibly slow to fix the servers.  Constant server down and LONG loading times.  The troublesome part is that tons of top end streamers said that they were going to be playing this game at launch.  So they had to have known at least 300k+ eyes were going to be on their game, just from that alone.  They should have prepared, over shot the server needs and then scaled back afterwards.  Instead, they are scrambling right now to fix bottlenecks.  It shows a gross amount of negligence on their part.

I don't want to play Black Paladin. I prefer European because to me it makes more sense. This is why I never touched D2's Paladin. It was weird. When D3 came out I was excited because I could play a witch doctor. I didn't ""feel"" offended. I was pretty impressed at the character and class itself.

I'm growing tired of people forcing us into these weird character roles that don't line up with our own interpretations of our selves as well as having people who are not black tell us how we should feel about how they butcher our image in many mediums across entertainment when we're just trying to escape like every other race from the real world just for a few hours.

I wanted to try a rouge but wanted it to make it latino or hispanic in looks because I like those people and they often have this suave and dexterous vibe to them. Doesn't mean I think they are thieves. Rogues have a slickness to them and I wanted to make one but I quit the game after making my lv100 mage and turning him into a spellblade.

But character creation aside, the overall tone of the game is very flat and dull. It's like a training ground for people who don't know how to play other ARPGS but are fascinated by the LE class system that, at first glace would be overwhelming to some, is a watered down version of something you'd get from other ARPGs. What's funny is that Grim Dawn has a comprehensive and obvious explanation of the class progression and hybridization while still excelling in making the player understand what their investment entails.

I would score LE, today, 5/10. No hate, just disappointed in the launch and the execution overall. It has potential should the devs regroup and fix the parts that mire the game from becoming something others would love to recommend to others.

Right now it's being recommended by streamers/youtubers who are paid to promote it.

Side quests are mostly text based, but that doesn't really matter since it is optional, and chances are, if u aren't into the story, u where going to skip it anyway and visa versa.

Interesting unique items that change the way you can build a character.  I see myself playing this game every day for months.,1708785010,1708785010,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is fine. I recommend it for its price. Has some nice systems, not too overwhelming. There are enough things to explore. But overall it feels a bit dull. As an ARPG enjoyer I don't think I would play it for as long as I have D2 or PoE. Not in this state atleast.

Positives

+ Devs are transparent about the launch issues, though, this is done with 3rd party software, i.e Discord, and not in-game

+ Crafting system is great, though, you get waaaay more shards than you get useable bases

+ Game performance is overall great, some occasional fps dips

+ Abundant stash tabs, bought with in-game currency

+ Beautiful UI

+ Graphics, terrain and other related textured elements look sharp and the game has neat lighting. The only problem is there's not a lot of moving elements, so if you stop moving the game generally looks like a still image

Negatives

- Launch issues... yeah. I don't think I need to elaborate on this one as thousands already have

- Story is ...idk, there's 3 gods and uhhh yeah

- Monster sound effects are scarce in variation, and are often human voice lines. Those become repetitive

- You cannot rebind RMB and LMB, even if you clear them first. Some passives use a specific skill slot. RMB is slot 5 by default, these skills use skill slot 1. This is a fundamental flaw. If you try this and attempt to get RMB back on slot 5, NOPE. The only way to get it back there is to reset ALL keybinds to default. The game stores and reads keybinds IN THE WINDOWS REGISTRY. Why in the bloody hell these are stored in the registry, and in a completely clumped-together, unreadable format is way beyond me

- The character's movement animation is laughable when the cursor approaches the center of the screen, with some skill you can even moonwalk like Michael Jackson

- Loads of UI elements become stuck until you hover over them again

Ending words

I think the game has a lot of potential. I will edit my review as the issues are resolved but for now, it's not something I'd recommend until they manage to sort out some of the major issues.",1708784955,1708784955,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off many of you don't understand how much work goes into publishing a simple game, and this is no simple game.
EHG is not a AAA studio and networking/multiplayer issues with such high user demand are to be expected.
They even went out of their way to make a Full Offline mode so people can play while the servers are down.

All in all, the game is amazing and it might not be for everybody. The game feels like a mix between diablo and path of exile leaning towards the latter. Not to be discouraged it is not as complicated as path of exile and every feature is well explained through gameplay. For the price of 35€ as of writing this review I would say it's more than worth the price.

It's sad that such a great and hard working developers are getting left with bad reviews because of peoples ignorance.

Fast forward to present day, at its official 1.0 release, and I'm still blown away by the game and its staff. Yes, its having issues right now at launch, but that's not unique to them. What I'm impressed most about, is their communication and transparency through everything. Sure, I would love nothing more than not to have the issues we are all currently having with online play, but what tempers that is their dedication and communication to work through things. 

While its still not perfect after 3 days of launch, it has gone from almost unplayable online, mostly in cycles, to being able to play almost seamlessly within 36 hours or so. Its still not perfect, but I'm quite impressed by their response. 

The community, however, is still pretty divided between ""why does this not work, fix your servers, game is crap"" and ""y'all have no idea how much goes into something like this and their response is been pristine by other company's comparisons,"" and I happen to be in the latter camp.

I love the game and it's my main arpg. I played a little before D4 and when I was left sour with D4 I came back here and put 200+ hours in. I don't have much experience with PoE due to a very late start and not wanting to catch up to everything.

I come into this review a little biased. Having over 300 hours in game of the early access, I absolutely love it. It's very easy to get into without being very complex. I'll echo what everyone else says, not as complex as PoE, but more complex than Diablo. It has an offline mode if you want to play solo. It's a good middle ground between the two. It has skill trees for each skill in game. 5 different classes with 3 subclasses that are permanent. The game isn't very easy, but it isn't unforgiving.

The characters are not customizable. The game is getting reviewed bombed right now and it's not without merit. The launch was pretty bad in terms of server issues.

- don't need 20 spreadsheets open to learn something
- very and I mean VERY good crafting systems
- A WHOLE LOT of stash tabs with IN GAME gold
- you can make literally any build and it will work [of course some are better than others]
- Respecing passives is TOO easy
- IN GAME gears looks amazing [not some bucket on head and pant less armor]
- pretty easy to craft unique gears
- Unique gears are NOT one in 5 million chance to drop 
- there is no ""900 Unique gears and 896 of them are BAD"" situation.
- it has IN GAME loot filter creator and its super easy to make or fast to import.


CONS:-
- Can't make jokes like ""loading everyone else's stash tabs""
- Can't cut social interaction for WEEKS in order to learn the game.
- Main story could've been better
- Character customization is non existent (not skins)
- Respecing skill specialization feels kinda bad [but I can accept it]
- Can't change current ascension class
- 5 skill slots are not enough [I WANT MORE BUTTONS TO PRESS]
- currently no dedicated dodge in the game
- Gambling for items is kinda meh
- some boss's AOE attacks are too fast to move out of their way [or maybe I'm just bad XD]

The build combinations are insane. So many ways to customize your build. I ended up making a rogue that is basically a caster, throwing poison nets all over the place and slowing enemies while my falcon pet drops acid flasks on their head. Unreal.

Combat doesn’t feel “right” like in POE and the loot is confusing , salvaging requires resources, instead of auto sort and auto arrange crafting material, they have a button for you to click ( why? ). Controller support is an afterthought, to be able to check your filter you need to have 4 hands.

Last Epoch is a solid ARPG that offers a decent single-player experience, but unfortunately, its multiplayer aspect leaves much to be desired. While the game itself is enjoyable, with satisfying combat and a good variety of character builds to explore, the multiplayer aspect falls flat.

Despite the promise of co-op play the multiplayer experience is marred by a host of technical issues, from frequent server disconnects to servers not working completely. As a result, many players may find themselves frustrated by the lack of a reliable multiplayer experience.

Additionally, while the game's graphics and sound design are generally good, they are not particularly standout or memorable. The game's story is serviceable, but doesn't offer anything particularly unique or compelling.

Overall, Last Epoch is a decent ARPG that will scratch the itch for fans of the genre looking for a solo experience. However, those looking for a solid multiplayer experience may want to look elsewhere, as the game's multiplayer aspect is currently lacking.",1678920695,1708782137,False,12,1,0.518464565277099609,6,True,False,True

I'm not in IT so, no I don't understand the difficulty of making an online game, I also do not care. Customers do not care about how a product got to their door, they just want a functioning product.

As for game play. It's mostly the same as it was in EA, except now with controller support which is a major plus for me. The character customization is amazing. The graphics, are ""fine"". The character aesthetics are beyond bad, if you care at all about this (I actually don't), skip this. It's hilarious to me that 2 genders for each class was too much, but being able to handle 100s of thousands of online users was deemed doable.

Overall, I want to like this game, I do. The deal breaker in the past was the combat was clunky and lacked controller support. Both are fixed. 

But, I can't play it. As I'm writing this review I'm stuck on a load screen after my 3rd restart. I actually loaded in briefly only to crash when trying to leave the town. I have spent 7 hours according to steam ""playing"" this 1.0. Reality is I'm only level 15, because it is just not playable online.

I could play offline, but then if I do want to play with friends I'm screwed. This isn't Grim Dawn with a nice co-op feature.

In conclusion, if servers ever get good enough to play for me to really try 1.0 out, I'll update this review. Unless I move on to some other game of course and forget this exists, like Diablo 4.

Recommendation. If you just want to play offline, liked Grim Dawn, think PoE is too complicated and Diablo 4 too dull, you will probably enjoy this game. If you want the online functions, stay away for now.",1697657882,1708782047,False,0,0,0,15,True,False,False

I've posted my review when the game was in beta giving it a 9/10 score, now I'm editing it to fit the current state of the game. I know this game had terrible launch day and it might not recover from what that means. I hope it does recover and I hope the devs fix the servers and players can enjoy this awsome game. Still I'm taking the bad launch day into consideration for the score because it does affect the playerbase in a negative way.

🔵 Overall game score: 7/10

✅ Pros:
• Smooth combat and overall controls 9/10
• Build diversity and character customization 9/10
• Item hunting factions (next-gen feature) 9/10
• Charm inventory system (idols) 10/10
• Crafting system is awsome 8/10

❌ Cons:
• Bad launch day (servers overloaded, players can't play the game) 3/10
• No character customization (gender, hair, etc.) 2/10
• Repetitive endgame content 4/10
• Slow character progression 3/10

The game was really fun in early access. The transparency and consistent updates from the dev team are cool. Reminds me of the late 2000s before audiences got plain nasty, effectively sending that communication into the abyss. Unfortunately, none of us bought transparency or communication. We bought a game. Having trouble for the first several hours of a launch is sort of expected the last several years. Being a few days in and still having online issues is not ok. 

I know the white knights for EHG hate these reviews. That's fine. I didn't buy them either. I understand that you cannot test for literally everything and you found yourself in an outlier situation. For that I'm empathetic. But the game doesn't function properly and that's what I'm reviewing. Cannot recommend a game that you can't play to its fullest.

And the game is still a buggy, unfinished mess.

Look, you see my play time and I will continue playing this game, BUT I would only recommend this with severe caveats and the developers general behavior pushes it in the ""No"" category.

First things first, if you take a look at established software standards you can easily read up what constitutes a ""beta"" version of a product. Feature complete, bugs to iron out, public testing sometimes engaged.

Last Epoch is not a beta. It is an alpha, still with missing skills, still with missing campaign chapters and quite frankly buggy up the gills.

But the ""juST cOsmETic"" shop works. Oh and the supporter packs work and the Ultradeluxe edition works.

And now the big release creates the next problem, where the ARPG hungry crowd hugs its multiplayer finally to death. A multiplayer mode that was barely functional in the first place, with loooong load times, skills not working, rollback issues etc..

Why play it then?

Because the skill system is actually amazing.
All of my playtime comes from trying out new combos and builds. I only reached the (utterly boring) ""endgame"" twice.

The rest of the game is in a sorry state, barely holding together with Unity Engines already messy optimization and amateurish art, sound, animation, design.

The story is absolutely laughable, incoherent, poorly written, unfinished.

But the predatory MTX store works. And this is AFTER the backlash and the ""SoRRy wE hEar yOu"" apologies for putting overpriced, ugly, cosmetic armor in an early access game, hidden behind currency where you always buy the wrong amount.

I'm all for amateur game development and I don't think there is laziness or malice here. On the contrary I believe the team is probably crunching like there is no tomorrow, but somewhere a marketing guy needs to be fired. And a couple more experienced project managers need to be hired.

TL;DR

Do not buy this if you don't like bugs. Do not buy their microtransactions. This is NOT a finished product.",1680867995,1708781399,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You all are expecting an indie game studio to react to an overwelming amount of players in a matter of hours. They have litterally a 10th of the D4 team and other triple A titles. Which ALSO have server issues on the first days. But there it is just ""Normal"" I guess (They do still complain but it doesn't seem as extreme as in this case)

I feel like you are all to entitled and narrowminded to not just play it in Offline mode or be patient for like 3 to 4 days for the devs to fix the server issues.

Now onto the devs, in just the 6 years of beta they have shown so much promise. It's on the level of GGG in my opinion and on the front of cooperation with the community they're even better by a wide margin.

There is plenty of endgame content to make up for this thou!

+ They are working hard on fixing the remaining server issues. Be aware that some minor issues remain, there is a offline mode thou which is sperate from online. You cant switch a character back and forth due to cheatprevention. Thank the cheaters out there. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3165902092]How to offline mode.[/url]

+/- Cosmetics [b]can not[/b] be used in offline, be aware they cost money, some can be obtained by other means. 

+ Likable characters with their own backgroundstory (the background played when you started a new game but seems to have been removed, will update if it pops up. I like it.), please keep them sex-locked it would take away from their character! This is [b]not[/b] a CRPG.

+ Amazing skills, each with their own skilltree to make them as you want for your build! There are character-archetypes that add specific buildvariants with their own skills and passivetrees. You start with one passive skilltrees and get another when choosing your archetype. These can help define your build more.

I hope we will be seeing a tank archetype that either can reflect damage, get buffed when damaged and can use giant twohanded shields to attack. That would be lovely.

+ This game seems to be more skillbased, you dont [b]just[/b] push for the highest numbers and any character that doesnt cut it is useless. No you the player have to handle your character properly and use abilities wisely, no guides needed. Just look for those shared effects. I like it that way, even when the perfect gear doesnt drop you are not hopeless. Lets hope on full release it still is this way.

Endgame content will demand both skill and choice of items to equip. Dont forget to use the forge to enhance items and perfect their stats!

+ I have not seen any unfair attacks that autohit you in my playtests, keep it that way > looking at you Grim Dawn with the unavoidable lightning hits and so on. There are also circles and lines as a warning, showing you on the ground the attack pattern. You need to figure out directions yourself thou. In a game with that much stuff going on a times this is a must have!

+ Game looks good, great choice of artstyle! Beautiful graphics, animations, enviroments and effects. The early game got a really good overhaul.

+ There will be a bazaar to buy items which you will need to upgrade your factionrank for, this mitigates the problem where people will just buy gear and become overpowered early. You can also choose between two factions: One for selffound player and one for Coop players (bazaar to sell) with boni for each playstyle!! Amazing solution for all kinds of players!

+ There is a forge system in place for making your items better. Check [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT7uuV-_28]here[/url] for a better explanation of this mechanic than what I could do.

+ There will be ladders > basically a race for each player in online and seasonal content was promised, it is unsure when we will see the first season.

+/- PvP was promised in their Kickstarter, if they are pulling through with that promise it will be after some balance updates. I am also sure that most players are [u]not[/u] interested in PvP, so I think mentioning it is the least I should do.

+/- I agree that if the devs need to pay for servers that they should be compensated (game sales alone arent going to cut it) but the current pricetag for other editions of the game are laughable. Just way to expensive. They are not forcing us into buying these purely cosmetic options but come on, at least give the EA testers something more than a crappy guppy...

[H1][u]My opinion so far:[/u][/H1]

This game will be something I spend my free time on after work.

The story line is OK so far. Not as cinematic as Diablo but good enough as I'm just here for the loot and explosions. 

Looks like they have plans for more endgame content so I feel I'll definitely get my moneys worth playing through the game. Of course mileage may vary depending on your financial situation and disposable income.

I've seen it said a lot but bears repeating as I agree with the comment. This game feels more in depth than the D3, D4, and Grimm. I feel like I can pretty much set up my character myself or follow a guide and be pretty successful. This may not be the case at end game depending on the challenge of that content.

LE is less complicated than PoE. I played through PoE a bit and it took me a lot longer to really understand what was going on in that game. Maybe it is me just being older but it was a bit overwhelming. Not so with this game.

Maps look and feel good. Not a lot of running back and forth.

Mob density could be a bit higher in some spots but I feel it is challenging enough.

Spells and abilities look good and it feels good when you can wipe the screen of enemies with your abilities.

Controller support is pretty decent. I prefer controller as it is easier on my hands.

I don't have to load everyone else's inventory when I visit a major hub. Bonus!

The cosmetic store doesn't have prices that would require a second mortgage on my house to purchase if I just wanted my character to look different.

[H3][b]Is it worth the purchase?[/b][/H3] 
In my humble opinion yes.

[H3][b]Do I think there will be plenty of content and support in the future?[/b][/H3]
Yes the devs seem to be working pretty hard to get the game issues fixed and seem to be very open with communication to the community.

[H3][b]Was it frustrating as hell on launch?[/b][/H3]
Yes but D4 was a bit sandy too.

Game is amazing. END of story. 

Its the best of PoE and D4 and gives you a fresh alternative between those two. 

Now with the launch there are problems with the connectivity due to technical errors and not the actual server capacity but tbh i don't really care. WHY though? Because we have tolerated this since D3 launches and many many other game launches. So I am willing to be lenient when an ACTUAL small indie company has similar issues but actually tries to fix them and is really open to communicating their progress and etc.

People don't mention this but the game is actually very stable now with some maybe longer transitions and sometimes requiring a re-log to fix your character getting stuck in a loading screen. But nothing that's too much to bear.

ALSO with the launch the game looks incredibly beautiful, like its totally different and everything runs butter smooth for me on the technical hardware side of stuff.

So yes, major positive and fully recommend it now, before and after. Have Fun Travelers !

Edit 1: Playing it after the official release and the servers are in awful shape. They were definitely not ready for launch. Wait for the devs to fix the issue before buying the game, if you intend on playing online. However, you could still choose to play offline, where I don't think there are any issues currently.

Obviously melee should be viable but no they made it the age old mobs stand/move just out of range nuking you and you can never get a decent weapon.  The beginning of the game feels good until you realize you were only having fun because the only gear it can drop at the beginning of the game is level appropriate.  As soon as you move up chapters it keeps dropping beginning game loot and you start struggling.

I'm struggling in a level 25 zone with my old level 10 weapon.  You know what doesn't drop in level 25 zones?  Level appropriate weapons.  Same junk that was dropping in the first chapter still dropping.  You know what you need in a loot game.... Nope devs missed it.  You need loot.  OMG such revelations.

Now I'm just going to use a small bit of common sense when it comes to gear.  If you are in a higher level area the mobs are probably going to be using higher level gear themselves and should probably drop that.  Just saying.

The shop doesn't sell you any good gear.  You need forge points in order to forge a weapon to be usable.  The shop intentionally only sells gear with a low unusable amount of forge points for whatever inane reason.  To get gear that you can forge you need mobs to drop it because mobs drop gear with lots of forge points and guess what mobs don't do.... DROP LEVEL APPROPRIATE GEAR.  

I'd be fine with crafting gear instead of finding it but you need to provide craftable bases.  I can't fix your loot for you and I have no idea why if you actually played even one ARPG in your life you would think dropping low level bases in high level areas is intelligent.


UPDATE.  You pass the refund window just trying to get on their servers so I'm stuck with it.  Fine I can't go melee unless the RNG gods bless me with a weapon.  I'll go caster which is favored in most games anyways.  Tried some skills I found interesting.  Tried their ranged class.  Started looking up guides because the skills I liked couldn't do anything.  Turns out this is another of ""those"" ARPGs.  You know, they have ton of skills but only 1 or 2 per class is actually useful.  

They actual took development time to make a skill that is not viable and build out a full skill tree for a non-viable skill.  Those are man hours that could have been used in useful ways but no they wanted the illusion of choices without putting the hard work in to make sure those choices have impact.  Diablo 3 might only have 1 or 2 skills viable for ladder pushing but at least all their skills can take you to endgame.  Some of  Last Epoch's noob trap skills they made cannot even get you through this games campaign unless you are willing to throw endless virtual bodies trying to push through the campaign.  Everybody is going on and on about all the ""customization.""  Why isn't anybody actually using all this ""customization?""

I am so tired of these lazy development farces that want to provide illusion instead of content.  I saw a video clowning D4 for lack of depth.  You really shouldn't clown other games if you can't even see through the facade on this one.  While D4 most assuredly lacks for depth this game does as well.

People are so thirsty for some good ARPG content they'll go chasing any mirage.  I feel bad for anybody that thinks there is depth here.

Art team you did good.  Not high resolution stuff but the whole world looks and feels like it fits together.  That is hard so kudos to you guys.

Sound I always take for granted.  I didn't hate it which means you guys probably did good as well.

Game play and design team you should be ashamed of yourselves for providing such shallow content.  This part is the meat.  The dessert eye candy was great.  Why was there no meat to dig into in this game?

Also, even in the limited play time due to the ceaseless server issues I managed 3 characters to around level 30.  I had a quest bug out on me and get stuck in the quest log.  No way I can see to even remove it even though it was completed so it kept trying to send me to a place with nothing in it.  Why do ARPG developers insist on putting in quests if they don't have the talent to make them work?  I'd rather a straight hallway with monsters in it than a broken quest line.  

If you don't have the talent to make quests than dumb the game down to your talent level.  At least then the game would work.  I'd rather a boring game where I can say, ""I came, I saw, I quit"" rather than,""That game is broken trash.""  You did it to yourselves.  Don't reach beyond your talent level and stuff won't break.",1708584181,1708779831,False,6,3,0.346955806016921997,0,True,False,False

POE didn't do it. Diablo 4 sure as heck didn't. But Last Epoch is a terrific ARPG that scratches all the right itches for me as a hard-core player in the genre. The class/sub-class system has so many ways to spec out different builds and play styles even within one class, since each skill/spell has an extensive skill-tree and you can't level everything. As soon as you start realizing how 2 or 3 skills/spells can work together well in battle you'll realize that, just like with Grim Dawn, you'll have a LOT of fun restarting (or respecing) in order to try out new and inventive ways of killing mobs and bosses. For example, with the rogue, there's a spell about 15 levels in where you can throw 2 then 4 daggers that pierce enemies and then stick into the ground with clicks 1 and 2. Third click pulls all the daggers back to you, damaging anyone in their path. Combine that with the rush skill -- which takes you a good distance down-field -- and you've got a whole new combo to mess around with. The crafting system is COMPLEX but not COMPLICATED. By which I mean there are a lot of options, but not a lot of crazy rules or many different types elements/items to find. The graphics are beautiful and if you stop once in awhile to look at some of the fantastic parallax backgrounds and compare them to the gray-brown drabness that is D4... you'll just whistle and shake your head. I like some grim dark in my fantasy, but not every scene, every time, and Last Epoch has a huge variety of environments and foes. The biggest thing for me? The combat is fast and fun and keeps you moving from scene to scene without a ton of dialogue or cross-country hiking/riding. The story is fine and has some nice, new details. The inclusion of time travel adds both some texture and humor, as a ""future NPC"" will send you back in time to warn their earlier self of something, and that's just a good time. I understand that there have been a lot of people frustrated by the server issues for multiplayer gaming at the start... I trust they'll work those out. I play these games solo, and there have been ZERO technical issues for me on either my main gaming rig and my ASUS Rogue Ally, which handles the game nicely. 

If you're a fan of Grim Dawn, Torchlight 1 and 2, or the early Diablos, you really are in for a treat, especially if solo play is your main gig.",1708779406,1708779406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And there are unique items that can change how a skill works, opening more possibilities. Never did I regret buying this game.

Previously I left a bad review because of pricing issues. It's no longer relevant but I'll keep it for archival purposes.

Edit: they fixed the prices
I bought this game for 1475 moneys, enjoyed every minute of it so far, great game. But today, almost one month since I started playing it, developer released deluxe and ultimate edition preorders (1600 and 2100 moneys respectively) and base edition upgrades (550 and 1100). I would be happy to get myself ultimate edition but it feels punishing to me that I, already owning the game, am at a 475 moneys disadvantage compared to not owning the game in the first place.

Don't forget to get your secret boots in the very first area!  When you encounter the first bear, go around the corner where you start seeing the purple and pink crystals, break down the wall in the corner and kill the first bear, break down another wall, then kill the bear by the large skeleton inside the cave, pick up your boots!

Update May - Multiplayer is absolutely broken.
Can't play with friends without getting disconnected.  Sometimes it's a monolith or two, sometimes it's impossible to complete a single monolith.  If you're looking for multiplayer, I would hold off to see if the multiplayer is addressed, or not.... TBD

Great game if you're into ARPGs!
It has the feel and vibe of D2, D3 and PoE, 
but you don't need to have multiple monitors filled with information to succeed and progress.
Beautiful graphics, great story and excellent, fun to play classes / masteries.
Love that each skill you choose to use has it's own specialization tree and there aren't really any meta builds.

GAME OVERALL: Great game. It requires less research compared to POE, but still has a lot of depth. The gameplay is really smooth and feels great. The endgame is very interesting and the classes are well done.
One thing that really stands out is that if you just dive in, find a skill you like, and start building around it, they’ve truly done a great job making most set-ups work well, so you run absolutely no risk of “ruining” your character and you can live out your fantasy.

LAUNCH: Rough launch, which undortunately has led to a lot of negative reviews. The servers are as of now a little bit shaky still but work well enough - it took them a few days to sort out the issues. Whether these issues are justifiably ”Their Fault” or not, I do not know.
What I can tell you however is that these Devs have kept up the best communication during these issues that I’ve ever experienced and keep us updated, make constant announcements , etc - so while I may only speak for myself, that builds my trust in them and I think It’s a real shame that these launch troubles, albeit severe, despite communications and professionalism, has led to a lower rating.

So all-in-all - I say - MUST-BUY for all ARPG fans. If you get real annoyed by longer load times and server hiccups, wait just a few days.",1708779099,1708779099,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Classes 9/10:
While not perfectly balanced (falcon boyz mostly), I feel the game offers a very good variety of playstyles through it's classes and masteries. A warlock feels different from a necromancer, a void night or a shaman - this is definitely a plus.

Skills 10/10:
While not as in depth as POE, this is way easier to both understand and build your own. I love the fact that you are not constrained by your gear as you are in POE by the sockets for example, but more on your character's level. 
Skills and items do a great job to complement each-other and for now I haven't felt like I couldn't play the build I wanted because I couldn't find that unique / set item that completely gatekeeps my desired build. 

Story / Lore (I don't know)
Apologies to the dev team for being a complete ahole and not paying any attention to the dialogue or try and bother to understand the lore. This is how I go about any game personally so it would not be fair to try and rate it .

Leveling experience (6/10) 
Completely ignoring the technical difficulties and given my current progress to act 8 level 48, I feel like I've done too much walking along ignoring anything but paying attention to the marker on the minimap. Probably because of the lower density of mobs than I would have preferred I feel it's a net loss to stop and kill those 3 monsters on my screen at points and I only do it where there's a big group only.
The overall path through the story mode feels confusing (might be because I don't spend any time reading what NPCs are telling me and just skip the whole thing). While I don't think a completely linear path would be a good thing, I felt confused on multiple occasions. The UI is better compared to how it was an year ago when I tried the early access Alpha, but I still believe it could be done better.
For me, personally, I feel this is the game's biggest weakness.

Combat (8/10)
The spells feel very good. When you call down a meteor or use a big ice blast etc you can feel the impact on-screen instantly. I do believe it's very in-line with what Diablo or POE have to offer.
As an enjoyer of the Lost Ark's combat system or Terra's this does not match the same level of visual & animation awesomeness. 

Graphics (6.5/10)
Not it's strong point but it's not what the game was designed for. It is enjoyable though and some big improvements are noticeable in 1.0 vs 0.9 or older versions. 
Definitely a lot of room still left for improvement

Itemization (9/10)
You can customize your own loot filter....imagine that D4 *wink
No affix feels completely useless, your don't end up having to choose between 10% more damage to slow enemies or 10% more damage to close enemies.....

Crafting (100000/10)
The most enjoyable, easy to pick up, medium to master system I have seen.
I strongly encourage everyone to give it a try, you don't need to read 10 PHD thesis and follow a 50 steps process just to craft a helm to put on your head (POE).

Trading (15/10)
Amazing innovation, a great way to make everyone happy without relying on 4 different external tools just to get the item you want.

Latency is 200ms+ because it put me into US central servers, despite me living in Northern Europe and putting EU west as my server of choice. There is no way of actually changing the server either, so you are stuck with it.
And all of this is if you are ""lucky"" enough to actually get into the game at all, because despite every beta testers telling them for literally years, that their servers was not ready, they ignored them and launched the game without enough capacity.
Also, the game isn't actually out of early access. They say it is. But it is nowhere near finished. Even the main campaign is not completed. Add this to all the other bugs and server issues, and they still have the audacity to sell it as a ""out of early acess"".

The worst part? The actual gameplay isn't that good either. People say it is like a perfect middle ground between PoE and D4, but from the limited time I had with the game, it is just not so. The skill system is just barely above Diablo 4 in terms of complexity, hardly a ""middle ground"". There certainly are some skills that seemed fun, but in terms of how they change the way you play, it didn't seem like it really made any difference.
The combat itself also feels clunky and unresponsive, the maps/zones are extremely linear and boring. The enemy designs are bland, the general aesthethic is bad, the voice acting is mediocre and if you care about story at all, that seems pretty boring as well.

I asked for a refund, but it seems stem won't accept it since I ended up playing for 3 hours.. Or, playing for 2 hours and getting stuck in loading screens and disconnects for an aditional hour.

Group play is a thing but is causing the most issues so far (imho) 


So why do I  still recommend the game? 


- Gameplay is more than good
- Solid end game base (Dungeons, ""Maps/ Rifts"" and PvE Arene with a leader board) which will expand with time
- Grafics improved alot with 1.0 and are an always ongoing process. Every update came with new models, new shaders/ lighting etc.
- Weather/ Season FX made replayability so much better
- so MANY viable builds that you can make almost everything work with enough time investment
- best crafting I have experienced yet
- chose between trade and (S)SF - each option comes with it's own perks to even the playing field between both",1677194827,1708778822,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you're a fan of waiting, watching, and finding joy in the unexpected, this game might just be the one for you. The central theme revolves around the art of patience, as players navigate through a world where everything seems to move at its own pace.

One of the standout features of Last Epoch is its unparalleled commitment to realism when simulating server downtimes. Map changes become a captivating experience as players find themselves engrossed in activities such as binge-watching entire seasons, completing a puzzle, or even learning a new hobby while waiting for the environment to load. The game truly captures the essence of anticipation, creating a unique and memorable gaming experience.

The lag, a characteristic feature of Last Epoch, adds an extra layer of challenge to the gameplay. Navigating through the world requires strategic planning and a keen sense of timing, as actions are executed in sync with the sporadic responsiveness of the game. It's an exhilarating dance between the player's inputs and the server's whims, creating an unconventional but strangely entertaining dynamic.",1708778805,1708778805,True,1,2,0.46875,0,True,False,False

I believe that the entire game cannot be judged based on the problems with the servers at launch. Build a reliable, high-performance scalable architecture, test everything, etc. - this is not an easy task, which even very large and cool companies do not always cope with.

- Do you want to start with falconer? Some users have reported visual bugs with the class, so maybe try a different class until it's fixed or wait a bit.
- Do you want to progress and play with friends? The online co-op experience is still being worked on, and has been reported to still not be fully stable. 

Was the launch messy? Yes! Wednesday the game was unplayable. Thursday barely, Friday I played the whole day online, and my experience steadily improved throughout the day. The devs handled their online infrastructure crapping out as gracefully as I can imagine - bear in mind as well that you can play fully offline if you don't want to deal with any of this mumbo jumbo. 

What makes this game special is how satisfying it is to put a build together. Synergies are fun to find, and you will get satisfying ones early on to build up. The difficulty and satisfaction of the game is ""How do I make this build idea as good as it can be""?

Ive been playing since launch WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS at all, because you can also play offline.
And even offline theres an online chat which makes you feel like youre online still.

The game is awesome. Its better than Diablo 4 in every way (except maybe slightly less on graphics).

I wanted to love this game, bought it last year played a bit but I thought the graphics were a bit dull and the wait times were horrendous (time for the game to load, to login and the go from a zone to another). Plus there were a lot of bugs (stuck in quests, event objectives not recognised by the game so you have to portal and go back to restart the event ... etc ...), but since the game was not finished that was to be expected.
I decided to wait for the launch of 1.0 and see in what state was the game:
- graphics are a little bit better, not good, better.
- 2 new specialisations, good.
- The game was so laggy and buggy at launch (and still is 48h later by the way) that it is nearly impossible to play online: I managed with a lot of patience and retries to get an online character to level 10 but got stuck in an infinite zone transition and gave up.

The devs are telling the players to try the offline mode which is a bit problematic since:
- you can't play with your friends
- you can't trade
- You cant't see your cosmetics which is baffling since those are litteraly on your steam account (not linked to a specific Last Epoch account you would have to be logged on). But the way when I was playing online, the load time of the cosmectics shop was instantaneous: I guess we see where the dev priorities are.

So I tried, I levelled up an offline SSF charecter to level 20 with no real issues except for launch time of the game is still stupidly long and the event objectives bugs are still there 3 months after ... This was pretty fun all considered.

Tried to continue offline, this morning and the offline mode is bugged; my charecter appears naked on the selection screen and when I click on the button to start nothing happens ...

I can understand the developers teams is small, it's their first game, online and server load is a hard problem to solve ...

 I have since posting this review rerolled my character 2 times now. For experimental purposes... I hated the necro in beta but felt i didnt give it enough of a chance. Rolled both a spellblade and a Warlock to the level 30 range and i must admit. This game does one thing no other ARPG has done for me. Made any class you play enjoyable. I hate caster type classes typically in ARPG's but they really cracked the recipe for making classes enjoyeable even for the most jaded of players set in their way (hai thats me :D ) I truly think that Last Epoch has a great formula for the future and simply needs to sort out server /game stability to really take over where D4 has completely failed.

Ive always hated POE,
Ive only played D4 because i used to really love D2/3

This game in ARPG's or gaming as a whole has restored my faith that there can still be good games made without it being stripped down for profit. Please dont Throw away this winning formula!!

11 hours played.

The early stages of this game really dont do it justice, it was hard to get into but once you started with a solid build for your character it starts feeling pretty good to smash through mobs and feel like a badass.

Super Spiel. Grafisch kommt es natürlich nicht an Diablo 4 ran, ist aber dennoch super gut!  Und auch die Skills haben von Grafik / Sound her nicht so den Punch wie in Diablo 4. Es macht super viel Spaß zu spielen und auch, dass man offline alleine spielen kann ist ein großes Plus. Ja, beim Launch gibt es sogar bis heute Serverprobleme. Da man aber, wie gesagt, offline spielen kann, sehe ich das als relativ unkritisch. Man hat so viele Möglichkeiten, seinen Char bzw. die Skills zu individualisieren, dass man ohnehin mehrere Chars / Runs haben wird. Auch ein großen Lob an die Entwickler, die aktuell mit Hochdruck an der Lösung der Probleme arbeiten UND uns auf dem offiziellen Discord auch ständig auf dem Laufenden halten. Wer unbedingt (ohne Probleme) online spielen möchte, sollte vielleicht noch ein paar Tage warten und parallel die News im Discord im Auge behalten und dann in ein paar Tagen in das Game einsteigen. Aber allgemein ein geiles Spiel, welches ich auf jeden Fall empfehlen kann.

Camera is wonky, bit of a high angle and too zoomed in, would be nice to control it to a degree.

The VA quality varies a lot, to the point some minor characters should just be removed and have no VA.

You have a lot of cool abilities but you're limited to not only unlocking 5 of their progression trees, but you can also only use 5 on your hotbar, and basic attacks count as one, you cant even just left click into barrels to whack them, you literally need an attack ability out of the 5 slots to break things, its a disappointing limitation just being restricted to 5 abilities when you get like 10 base + 5 from your specialisation and another 10 from the other two subclasses you didnt specialise in.

Theres a lot of weird difficulty spikes where youre doing fine and then just some random attack or a small group just deletes you, and it doesnt make much sense, its not really a matter of avoiding tells, which you do have to do, but you will just occasionally melt, even to trash mobs.

The Ruined Epoch and the Imperial Epoch are both back to back in the story, but very very similar, to the point the game becomes pretty dull during that part of the story, and theres essentially an entire Epoch that afaik isnt really used, but IDK.

Progression is pretty bloated with boring unlocks, like +1 to Vitality... that gives you +6 base HP and 1% resist to poison and necrotic damage IIRC, its not interesting in the slightest, it doesnt make much sense.

Speaking of not making sense, a lot of part of the game arent really explained at all, like the Forge for crafting items, its actually pretty neat and useful, but you wouldnt know that if all you did was read the in game guide for it, and while theres a lot of info in tooltips for abilities, its not clear or detailed enough to fully grasp spells, and theres such a dumb oversight where the tooltips dont work when creating a character because it doesnt tell you base damage, it calculates damage based on your gear, which a fake menu character obviously doesnt have, and also it will have nested abilities like proc'ing a nuke, and while the ability that proc's is highlighted, there doesnt seem to be a way to make the tooltip stick around so you can hover over the text.

The story is a bit mid, just really scatter shot with a lot of random elements and not any consistency, no setup for your own character, not really obvious what motivations and goals other characters have, and OFC because of the nature of the story where you're travelling through time, part of that cant be helped, but the different Epoch's are just so generic that none of them really stand out aside from the kind of really base level design you could see in a game from 30 years ago, like its OK to have a desert area and a grass area, but its really got to have some more going on than the theme alone, and here thats all it really is, and youre jumping between them so much that theres no real connection or pathing, especially when teleporting around is so easy, and you pretty much are forced to stop at every tear to jump to another Epoch, because that might be the only way to enter that particular area, needing to go through tears from one Epoch to another, no normal land access, its really disjointed.

UI is also a mess, with things not working and it being hard to track things.

Targetting sucks and doesnt work half the time, but that might be server lag.

Minions are indistinct from similar enemies. It seems like most of the minions suffer from this, but the undead minions are the worst because in the Imperial Epoch you're fighting nothing but skeletons that look exactly like your ones, and managing them is a pain, with no UI indications they are dead or dying, and you would think just highlight the buttons when one dies or a red overlay on the button when youre at max cap for that minion, but its no surprise because the UI in the rest of the game is pretty meh, and you would have to be cutting corners to be using such similar models anyway, if not what I actually think... that they are literally the same models just recycled, but IDK, hard to tell.

Also I really just dont get why you are stuck with the sub class you pick... just let me change it, why make me roll an entirely new character that spends the first several hours playing exactly the same, just because I want to try one of the other 2 sub classes, it makes even less sense than only having 5 abilities and not having a basic attack on left click.",1660644372,1708777187,True,0,0,0.50939476490020752,0,True,False,True

But this one thing baffles me beyond anything. Every ARPG Launch you witness goes wrong. How on earth are developers still surprised by this and why is no one doing pre release stress tests to mitigate this issue? 
I personally enjoy the multiplayer aspect of games and loading times in group play have been horrible between zones even before 1.0 release. 

Half a work day in and the devs are still trying to fix a module that seems to be the problem, which is basically seeming useless as a feature. They still did not make progress on fixing it. 

So at this point in time I am not seeing any progress in Multiplayer compatibility unless you love long loading screens between zones (and yes the maps are not that big and you have to change zones constantly. 

Edit/update: ""played"" 8 more hours and got asked to review again. I waited most of that time for the game to not load me into another zone, or to show me an error. Communication from the dev team is great though. So since it is either thumbs up or down I would still have to say down. What good is a game that is not playable or has you wait 50% of the time. 
Silver lining: if you manage to lag and wait through to the end game. That supposedly is stable and unaffected by the malfunctioning API/Container

Edit/Update2: The main problems seem to be fixed for now. The game is running smooth enough, that I can in good conscience give a recommendation for this game and the state it is in. The devs are working really hard on being transparent and involved, even when a lot of the community is sending negativity their way. That is something that is pretty rare these days it seems.

Last Epoch wows for all the wrong reasons: how can a game that is graphically this outdated and underwhelming have such long loading times? This is not a launch issue, this was even before launch. To start up the game"" wait 10 mins. To enter the world: another 5 mins.
Having spent 5 YEARS in EARLY ACCESS and you f*** up the launch this badly?

It looks underwhelming (version 1.x), the combat feels slow and clunky. Gameplay is repetitive and the world is just meh. There is way too much focus on crafting.

Diablo IV killer? Nuh-uh, I don't think so, and that game was mediocre at best. Even Warhammer Chaosbane is better!

Overall, Last Epoch is an over-hyped, below average game. There is nothing here that justifies forking out $35 when you already have one of the many other ARPGs. If you don't, there's better alternatives at a cheaper price.

Well I played in 2022 or early 2023, the game was fun, there were a plethora of bugs, but it was fun. Some of the bugs were deadly for hardcore and very frustrating. At the time, I had looked into the bugs to report them, because it was fine right? It was in early access. Well when I went to report those bugs, I saw they had already been reported, a year or two prior.... Ok, maybe they were low priority?

Well here it is 2/23/24, and woohoo 1.0 is out. So they must think they have fixed the bugs by now right? 

Haha, you already know... WRONG. I was playing the Lich class which I find quite fun. You basically transform into the grim reaper, use your abilities in that form, then it slowly drains your health and you transform back to your human form once your health reaches zero (but have full health back in human form).

Well there I was fighting a boss, transformed out of lich form, but what's this? The game decides I should lose complete control of my character. Can't move, can't cast abilities, but certainly can die? Most certainly!

Now this was all fine and expected during early access. But the dev's still have this happening now, after it has been an issue for years? It seems to me these dev's don't give the least care about fixing existing bugs, and I cannot recommend this game still at this point. Which is infuriating as it seems like it should be so much fun, but these bugs are so obnoxious. 

Also, in the 80-90 minutes I played with my brother, we de-sync'd from each other no less than 7 times. Which bugged out zones and caused other annoying issues as well. 

Now if you like softcore mode, then you shouldn't be as infuriated by the bugs because a death isn't a big deal. But if you love hardcore mode like me, this is in no way ready for such.

These guys have not learned or simply don't care, I don't know which is worse.

I'll give it a go one more time to see if I can figure out what the trigger is for the bug and avoid it, but I'm confident if I find another game-breaking bug I'll just quit once again.

Disregarding the current technical issues for the moment, here are the (subjective) pros and cons:

[h1]Pros[/h1]
- As far as a mere hour or two of actual game time allow for an estimation, the game seems to provide a gameplay complexity somewhere in between the latest installments of the Diablo franchise and Path of Exile according to the active and passive skill trees. The whole idea behind the classes and masteries also seems like an interesting approach, allowing for some specialization while keeping parts of the overall classes' mechanics.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Itemization feels ""odd"" from the very beginning, as common loot is comparably powerless quite quickly. Yes, there are loot filters, but why do such items drop in the first place if they're meant to be filtered out?! In addition, options to customize items are accessible quite early, even before the player has the means (i.e. the materials) to make use of them, adding to the ""oddity"" of itemization mechanics.

- Zones resetting each time the player leaves and returns to them bars any explanation. While there might be technical reasons for this, there are very few (if any) other games behaving the same way and it's somewhat enerving when a quest requires the player to enter a sub-zone, such as an indoor zone, already knowing that the main zone will be reset on return.

- The story seems bland at first, at least based on the names of locations and characters that are thrown at the player from the very beginning without fitting them into the larger context of deities and the time ""mechanic"". This might be intended though and resolved over the course of the game, but during the first few hours it feels rather irritating...

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Some of the above might not even feel so strange to players having played the game for a while during the Early Access phase, as they would be used to some of the game's quirks. Being a completely new player, it feels strange though, almost as if the game was mostly directed at and developed for existing players and not for new players. Targeting existing players with the end-game mechanics makes sense, but targeting the early hours of the game at new players might help those to get into the game a little easier.

I'll probably give the game another chance once the current technical issues are ruled out, but at the moment I'd suggest staying away from the game and better (re)turn to other games for the time being.",1708703095,1708775388,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

But devs failed to implement online gameplay, proper endgame, mob density, Interesting story, graphics. They promised it for ages, then promised to fix it when it was clear that it has some serious problems with online. Now its fully released (overall doesn't feel like full release, just another beta). It still has tons of bugs, online play is still broken (reminds of Wolcen), performance is nowhere near being good when there are a lot of mobs on the screen (btw mobs quantity is very low), graphics are ok'ish - but its art styyle is not for everyone - it almost  looks like it was made for kids (too cartoonish, soft, pets look like toys, chracters too). Story is medicore at best, poorly made, with not much detail, or depth to it. Soundtrack is also meh. Overall would give 6/10 - because of built-in loot filter, and good crafting system. If not for those two - 4/10.

 The engine they use will always be the limiting factor. So if you're willing to play offline only, solo, and dont care much about graphics and general performance - I would reccomend for its price, if you have money to spare, or better yet when its on sale. Otherwise - spend your money elswhere. Grim Dawn is much better solo/co-op experience overall, for example.

p.s.: I bought this game years ago. I always thought its going to be a mix of Diablo and PoE, but its not that. WIth 1.0 release its clear to me that the game had a lot of potential initially, but devs failed to make it happen. It's not capable to compete or even compare a bit to D4.

It's a live service game, with a cash shop where cosmetic sets are not too far off Diablo 4 (€20) and while the game does have offline mode, you can't use cosmetics you bought in offline mode.
The game is also not as great looking as Diablo 4, the combat is not as fun and the classes are gender locked and there's no character customization.
I really did try to give this game a try several times during its development (I bought the game in 2020), I just can't get into it and would rather play Diablo 4.


In a very saturated genre, Last Epoch stands out as a modern ARPG that does nothing special.

3 reasons why this game is not worth your money:

#1 The combat is bland and worse than 8+ years old Diablo 3. The skills lack oomph. Running around and hitting monsters, I feel nothing. Wolcen might be a game everyone is laughing at for slow progress, but boy, when I hit things there, I feel it!

#2 The characters are extremely ugly and unlikable as well as gear drop being bland. For example equipping leather armor on my knight doesn't change appearance compared to plate. I believe this is locked to item level, regardless of the type of armor. Lame.

And reason #1 and #2 are connected directly to the reason #3:

#3 Cosmetics store. This is why I don't play Path of Exile. It's updated often. It has content. But it has zero likability. Everything is ugly because there's a cosmetic store. From the characters to the item drops.
At least Path of Exile is free. This is not.

And on top of the above deal-breakers. They copied successful ARPGs and did nothing good or different.",1617481986,1708774103,False,3,2,0.429600775241851807,0,True,False,True

looks better than PoE and has an more easy entrance
so easy to learn hard to master
has very nice Builds like Wraith Necro (D3 Rathma necromancer) or Hammerthrow Paladin(d2 hammerthrow paladin KekW) this is what players of this genre want.

I have long searched for a game to pull me in where I could lose hours of time, enjoy myself, and just unplug from the daily grind of work and bills only to be let down by D4 and overwhelmed with the complexity of POE. Last Epoch is here now and is scratching that itch.

The game is easy to pickup, and you get out of it what you put in, meaning if you want to play hardcore to level 100 grind away hours and search for those perfect unique items or craft your own gear until you reach GIGACHAD damage numbers, knock yourself out. If you are more of a casual soft core player that wants to chill out after work and only have a few hours a day to spend playing its great for that as well.

You play your way either solo self found or by trading using the two in game factions each with their own unique twist that we have never before seen in any ARPG.


ADDRESSING THE MIXED REVIEWS....THE GAME IS WORKING NOW:
FYI the mixed reviews are from the initial first two days the servers were up and down. So called triple A titles have had similar issues. This is a small team yet they manged to provide a fully functional offline game mode while correcting those server issues and they fixed them in two days.

Things are getting better though, with only a few bugs after playing for a few hours. The graphics are mid, about the level of Poe 1 even on the highest settings. Even though the game claims it has full controller support, it's not great. It's fine, but not great. 
What makes the game good enough for a thumbs up from me is: the combat is pretty smooth and mostly lag free. I live in the Philippines right now, but I can still play with friends and family in the US. The customization is fantastic, without feeling overwhelming. Respeccing isn't a limited resource either, so you can play with new builds. Multiplayer has a few bugs in it, but I like how a lot of the builds have co-op utility in mind. 

If you don't want to read a rant, please skip this next part. 

As a whole, I don't agree with people thinking it should be an accepted practice for a game to come out like Last Epoch did. People have a right to enjoy their products when they are released, and if not, there is nothing wrong with leaving a bad review and moving on or refunding. 

However, I also don't agree with the other side of the spectrum. People start calling a game/product horrible or trash when their only experience with it is their limited amount of time at launch, and we all know the death threats are just flying in because people can't just shrug it off, give something a bad review and return the product when they are done.",1708772606,1708772606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Play in offline mode if you absolutely must play now.
2. Wait until things settle down and play.

The people at EHG don't deserve to have their game given terrible reviews for server issues that face launches. Yes, I know it is frustrating. Any thumbs down for server issues, at this point, is fair. If the reviews get updated after things have been fixed, then there isn't an issue. But there are probably many negative reviews that will not change.

The texture ?

The gameplay itself is very good but there are massive server issues preventing access to multiplayer and it feels like a dice roll as to whether you'll be able to play or not - and on the rare occasion I do get in I've been randomly crashed to desktop within half an hour of getting started and then unable to log in again.

I understand that people will say that you should expect day 1 server issues with games and I've experienced my fair share of bad launches but honestly at this point I feel like a lot of people have been conditioned to receive a bad product for their money and to just accept it. Perhaps I'm just frustrated with the combination of Last Epoch, Helldivers 2 and Call of Duty having server issues over the last few days preventing me from playing my main games - it's been a particularly busy week for me so being stuck in loading screens and unable to connect during the brief time I've had to play games is especially frustrating.

The game has an offline mode which is somewhat of a saving grace but I don't want to go back and re-do the start of the game just to get back to where I am in multiplayer. I did initially use it to play around with classes and work out what I wanted to play which was nice but I'd have loved to have seen LAN capability or something so I could still play with people even though the servers are dying.

I really hope that they fix the server issues but I'm not likely to change my review because of the sour taste this whole experience has left in my mouth, the industry should do better - if it truly is the case that launch day server issues aren't something that can be fixed then maybe the industry has to reexamine whether we have the technology or the infrastructure to do a launch like the last few that have gone particularly badly.

The game is already fun and will keep improving just like it did all these years in early access. The devs are honest and transparent which is a breath of fresh air given the current state of the industry. Support studios like that, support gamers gone devs. 

Server issues happen often. Should we accept this as the norm? Absolutely not! However, you should be able to think for yourself and not be entitled. The facts are LE is more successful than expected, EHG doesn't have Blizzard's budget/number of people/experience launching games. 

Is it the end of the world if you have to wait 1 more week for stability if you enjoy this type of game? For me personally the answer is no. Especially since you're able to experience the product fully offline while issues are sorted. It's not like we're unable to play like it often happens in all these online-only games when there's server issues.

The game is incredible. Servers are struggling of course, if you are surprised by that you have to be under the age of 12-14 and never witnessed any online launch ever. It was to be expected. How would a small studio like this be able to manage what no 1000+ employess AAA company has managed in the history of online games?
And that being said, this launch isn't even half as bad as some of those AAA launches of past years. For example, I opted to switch from EUW server with a 20 ms ping but lots of connectivity struggles, to EUE with a 100ms ping, which is still barely noticeable, and was able to play there almost flawlessly in multiplayer for hours.

Guys, they will figure this out.

On top of that: If you absolutely can't wait a few more days to play a game that you potentially waited for YEARS to get out of Early Access, then just use the offline mode for now? The fact that it is even there is huge and, sadly, not standard even today inbetween all those online-only games out there.

Again, as  soon as I switched to another Server, the gameplay experience was near flawless, even in multiplayer. And you don't have to start over on another server either, you still get to keep everything you played with on another server. The different available servers are just for ping and load dsitributeion, your character data is not saved separately on different game service servers.

The game has been praised so long for good reasons. Most of the streamers of you fanboys played and praised the game and everybody hopped on the Last Epoch train as a substitute for D4 or just an alternative action RPG until PoE2 releases.
To me, it´s just insane how quickly people become upset. The last years were only a few releases of such titles without any major server / online service issues. It was to be expected. 

With a couple more brain cells you would wait a couple days after the release and you could play without any major issues.

Yes you bought the game, paid some of your hard earned bucks and it´s clearly your right as a customer to expect and receive a working product. But as mentioned above, much bigger companys in the gaming industry had the same issues on launch day.

TLDR: tepid campaign, bland voice acting and slow/clunky game play - makes for a snooze fest. The flaws will become more apparent with time.

EHG have let us down much more than Blizzard, esp after all the heavy promotion and sponsorship they have done with content creators and streamers - the least they could have done was give us a good launch. Unfortunately, what they are doing now is banning and shutting down anyone who says anything “not nice” about the game, even if it’s genuine constructive feedback. Disappointing. 

I have lost hope that they will actually fix this game. SAVE. YOUR. HARD-EARNED. MONEY.

My early access rating: 6/10
My on-launch 1.0 rating: 5/10

The Good:
Graphics not bad - devs say they improved it on launch, but looks pretty much the same.
Loot filter.
Cool crafting system - easy to learn and get going (drop rate of crafting mats have been drastically reduced on launch when compared to EA - by at least 50%).
Awesome inventory management with endless stash tabs.
Can easily switch between controller and mouse (and you need to - see below).


The Bad:
Too many server issues at EA and on launch – at EA it was least 1 disconnect every hour or so and going from one area to the next takes 5-10 seconds. On launch it takes 20-60 seconds to got from one area to the next) - horrible!
Extremely slow game play - classes either have fast clear speed but slow movement (necro) OR slow clear speed with ok movement (sorc).
Map refogs and all mobs respawn every time you leave and re-enter a map. Totally kills exploration - if you go to connected area just to see what's there and come back - guess what? Everything fogged up and mobs re-spawned.
Have to speak with NPCs and go thru the dialogue options to start and end quests! Mercifully you can skip through and don't have to hear the dialogue in its entirety!
The above points paired with some of the really long map layouts and quests that go back-and-forth from one area to the next makes it really not fun. I actually dozed off a few times!!!
Some skills don't target properly (eg sorc’s basic shock and fireball skills) - especially when using a controller, really frustrating.
Controller support - There is VERY LIMITED controller support. Bad targeting, can't retag A and Y on controller, etc.
Still very buggy.

The Meh:
The story - which is I guess par for course for this genre.
The music/voice acting - really dry (esp since you have go through them) with some mobs and bosses making really annoying grunting sounds.
The lore - there are recordings that you can click and listen to some of the lore - but when you move away it fades off, what is the point? Who is going to stand there and wait for 2-3mins to hear it in its entirety? Just let it play while we get on with the game.
The bosses - none memorable.
Auto pick-up works only for gold in a very narrow radius. For crafting mats you have to pick up at least one and the rest in that drop then get auto picked. Not sure why this is being touted as a great feature.
Offline mode – your offline mode character is locked into offline, you cannot play it online. Kinda pointless mode. 


Early access bottom line: 
If you like PoE’s game play – you will find this game slow, and will likely not enjoy it as much.
If you’re looking for something other than D4 to play – this may be for you. Though for me the OVERALL pace of the 2 are about the same – with Last Epoch having a much better QoL and endgame (and of course much cheaper).

I really hope the devs add some options to speed up the game play, especially for those that want it, and fix the issues - but I have little hope.

Edit: 
I tried the Primalist and more of the same, had slightly better clear speed compared to the sorc, but the lack of fast movement or dash hurts. For the classes I played the skills seem to not be balanced at all.",1708070051,1708770344,False,4,0,0.473631769418716431,1,True,False,True

3 - offline characters are not backed up to steam cloud in what might be the most bizarre design choice I've ever seen in a game, meaning that any issues or corruptions that occur during e.g. updates can result in character losses, which is what happened with me after today's hotfix resulting in ~12 hours of gameplay being lost

It had server issues on launch, it still persists from time to time - that's why unpatient manchildren bombard it with bad rewievs. I don't think their opinion would be vailid in a couple of days as it will be fixed most likely. Most of the games have problems on launch and considering that this game was made by the smaller studio - such outcome is pretty predictable.
For me, after the recent update, the game works fine - even if I can't connect to west eu, i just can switch to NA servers as I have good IPS and ping is not that punishing. As some people said the game still has issues with auction and grouping but as I previously said - they'll probably fix it in terms of next week. Game is slowly but surely stabilizing.
As for the game itself - I really enjoyed it. Interesting crafting system which allows you wide opportunities in building item that will suit your playstyle - it can be compared in variety to POE, but it's so much easier to learn and understand. Interesting uniques system. Good skill and passive trees which add uniqueness to classes and at the same time you can learn passives from any mastery tree. Story and leveling is ok, but I never really enjoyed it in any ARPG so I can't make any statements on that. Endgame is diverse enough: you can run dungeons, you can go mapping - each map have a different bonus (gold, drop increase etc.), they've also added endless arena - and I think they will add endgame content  in the future, because the potential of the game is huge.
As a conclusion I definitely recommend this game as it is the most balanced ARPG in terms of complexity and fun I've ever seen or played.",1708769366,1708769366,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: Good graphics, optimized, very good game play and character customization options, endgame is mid but not bad, story was convoluted but not bad either. I like the whole jump through time lore, and the lore of the world but I can see how some wouldn't. I played only 1 class but I really liked it. The 2 trade systems are interesting, and possibly revolutionary for ARPGs - I'll have to wait and see for myself. You can still trade with friends who are there when things drop, and even when they aren't there you can use a resonator to trade something to them. The game has MTX cosmetics but isn't pay to win, and the purposeful ""blandification"" of your character's look isn't nearly as bad as PoE (driving you even more to buy cosmetics), but it's still there somewhat.

Cons: They dropped the ball on launch with server capacity/bandwidth. Hard. After their CEO saying that they were ""over prepared"". They are slow to add things, but when they do it does feel polished and worthwhile. Tencent bought into them, we don't know what % they own. We will have to wait and see what that entails. Still no option to turn off Public chat. Genderlocked classes, which didn't bother me, but I'm sure some people will find that annoying.

(1) On the game: I have played Last Epoch here and there during the last patches and decided to try it again with 1.0 and I have to say I already liked it, but with the 1.0 version they delivered something very good in terms of content and mechanics. When looking at what it brings to the table at launch I think it is also helpful to take into account how much content was delivered by other ARPGs at launch and in doing so realize that there is a lot being offered by Last Epoch (e.g. compared to launch D4 or launch of PoE in its initial versions - no sense in comparing LE with PoE in its 23rd season with literally several years of content and mechanics development).
Positive:
- Game offers good build diversity. Not to say all are equally strong - I think they do not have to be, but all of them can meaningfully get you into end-game content.
- I can put together my own build without being punished / bricking in my character and make changes through re-skilling.
- The game is very transparent regarding its mechanics and what is going on. The detail and structure of tooltips, the in-game guide, etc. all are super helpful without having to go out of the game and look at external resource and build pages. I wish all games would have such a transparent approach. If you do not want to read the information, no need to do so, so it is not like the game is burying you in text. But if you want to kniow what is going on, you can easily learn through teh game.
- QUALITY OF LIFE: one word: amazing (!). Idols going in a separate inventory. Crafting material stored in a separate inventory. Buy as much stash tabs with in-game currency as you want (all hail the god of hoarders). Re-skilling options. Easy to use lootfilter. And much more. Alone for that I think it could be worthwhile supporting EHG with purchasing this game. All companies should aspire to implement such a degree of QoL for their customers in their games.
- Masteries system (5 classes with 3 each) feels like it gives meaningful character identities to my different characters and provides quite the amount of diversity. Lots to try out and something there for most playstyles I guess. Very nice to see that classes are not held back behind payable DLCs or add-ons (EHG said they would never do that, so hope it stays like this). 
- Crafting is awesome! Being thoroughly intimidated by PoE crafting and thinking that the dumb single affix lottery of D4 does not deserve the name ""crafting system"" I was completely convinced by the accessibility of LE's crafting system and feel that it is truly meaningful for my play-through. Easy to learn, but by no means easy to perfect outcomes (so for min-maxing afficionados there is plenty to do later-on).
- Items are fun. I pick up every unique I find, not like in PoE where most uniques are crap and not helpful (dumb item bloat) ior like in D4 where the few uniques are all a bit lackluster. Additionally i am happy when I find a unique, when I find an exalted item but also when I find a nice rare or magic crafting base. 
- EHG provided a funtioning true offline mode. This is amazing! finally I can also play while travelling without having wifi. While trade won't function and the characters are not available to play in multiplayer, it is still nice to see that a company offers such an ""old school"" option. Very nice.
- Price: price tag is very reasonable, especially compared to current prices of so-called AAA productions. Also the ""PoE is free to play"" argument is bullshit. If you meaningfully want to play it, you need to spend at least 40-60 bucks for stash tabs. PoE is ""pay for necessary QoL"". LE developer has clearly stated LE will stay at its current price tag and is all you pay to enjoy the full content. All additional purchases through the very limited in-game shop are only MTX. No pay for QoL, no pay for power, no pay to win. So for me a reasonable economic investemnt for something that is likely to be able to rend you in the hundreds of hours of playtime.

To be further improved:
- Would be great to have auto pick-up of crafting material
- More endgame dungeons (developers said they will add with coming cycles)
- Need to balance and revamp older masteries (they feel somewhat lackluster compared to the newer ones)
- The game still can at times (depending on the skills you use) feel a tiny bit clunky, but it is definitely way better than in previous versions and more fluid. Still would be awesome to also get a dodge roll or WASD like in other concurretnly competing ARPGs (in development).
- Performance issues in some areas or with use of sime skills - is overall ok and I only had issues seldomly, but it happens sometimes.
- Loading speeds when playing in multiplayer with friends: definitely needs to get better. Is playabler but for an enjoyable experience more effort needs to be put in smoothing out current issues.

(2) Launch issues: No sugar coating it. The launch week so far has been rough and should have been prepared / tested better by EHG. However, looking at the deluge of anger-fueled and very unhelpful reviews in the past days I think it pays to keep in mind that (a) EHG is a very small company compared to other ARPG companies and it is their first game (not an excuse per se, but whoever expected no problems occurring considering the hype was just naive). (b) There is a functioning offline mode not impacted by any issues - so when people say they were sold a non-functioning product it is simply untrue. (c) The developer is very transparent in their comunication / updates on the current work being done to address the situation (more so than I have sse nother companies do). EHG seems to also immediately come up with in-game MTX as a ""sorry"" for all the problems that they will five everyone. While this does not at all have any impact on the problem per se, I feel that they care for their community and are way more reactive than other companies in this respect. If anything this should be appreciated. 
Nevertheless, similar issues happened during the multiplayer launch in 0.9 and I think, despite all limitations as  small company, EHG had the obligation to do a better testing of the servers in advance. You at this moment in time have two options: play in offline mode (nice to get to know the game) or wait with purchasing it until server situation is fixed (hopefully sooner rather than later). Good thing is that the base game is well done. The servers will be fixed at some point and then you will be able to enjoy a nice game for a manageable investment. Otherwiese i would suggest to wait until the game is on sale (assume this will happen at some point in the future). 

Bottom line: If you have not bought it yet and are thinking about it: Great ARPG as a game. Do not get distracted by all the server-related bad reviews of the past 2 days and wait a few days until servers are fixed and then go for it - you won't regret it.",1708765562,1708765562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It focuses on what matters:

-Nice class fantasies
-Interesting itemization
-High replayability
-Respects your time
-Perfect crafting (for me)
-Varied end game

Is it bad that you cannot play online? Yes and no. For a perfect release it should not be a problem (but remembar Lost ARK, New World etc). I had a blast playing the beta for >600 hours without even having online available. The game is perfectly playable offline. I play these games to theorycraft, chill out while killing monsters and binging youtube or netflix on the side. Use the time in offline to learn the game and find your class. It is fun!
The is no point of blaming EHG for the server infrastructure. They designed this love letter to the genre and delivered. I rarely write reviews, but EHG deserves more positivity! To all the people who write bad reviews after an hour, you are looking for the problem and are not interested in the genre.

The gameplay is good and the skill system is also very good and don't require an enormous amount of time and dedicationd to make a good build. The story is pretty good as well. 

A lot of reviews are negative and 99% of them are because the server issues that are being worked on. I've played ~25-30 hours in the first 72 hours (including one 12 hour session so I was there for highs and lows) and was there at the beginning and while the initial launch performed pretty poorly, the game functions just fine 90% of the time.

I'm having fun with single player, but hoping multiplayer gets sorted out soon for those that care. I understand the frustration, but saying an entire game is bad because of that is pretty whack.

Skills/Builds are awesome, insane amounts of choice and viability so far.
Itemization is solid, and in-game loot filtering is amazing (EXTREMELY specific if you want it to be).
Crafting is great, can hunt for exactly what you want and improve gear in exactly the way that you want.
Infinite customizable, sortable, searchable, organizable stash tabs.
Actual target-farming when you hit end-game - still RNG involved, but you can go for exactly the piece of gear you want.
Nearly endless min-maxing if you want to keep hunting for those 'PERFECT' drops/crafting, and the systems in place to make it not a massive headache, for those that enjoy this part of arpgs.

All combined making the game-loop actually fun instead of feeling like a chore.

My only end-game experience is from before 1.0, but seemed good even back then (obelisks/dungeons). Can't comment further than that.

The only things I liked better about D4 were the cutscenes, graphics, horses, and 'open world' (even though it was also pretty jank when servers were slammed).

But all-around GAMEPLAY/GAMELOOP-wise, I definitely prefer Last Epoch.  Although end-game, I think I still prefer Grim Dawn's numerous endless grinds. :)   And it's of course not as hardcore as PoE, if you never liked that (I could never get into it, and didn't have fun just looking up builds that explained the 20 different systems to learn *shrug*).

So it sits in a really good middle-ground where it just does everything it needs to do REALLY well. (except server issues at launch of course :).",1708764411,1708764411,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With that in mind, Last Epoch trully is a midway between the casual dead D4 and the goat PoE.

Add:  I finally finished the campaign and it was cool.  I felt it left more questions than answers, but it was clearly stated that more will come.  I like how the game ties-in the endgame mechanic.  I like how the end game works and how the game feels to play.  I can't say with every other arpg that I've finished that I felt that 
 need to try another classes, but with this one, I genuinely want to try as many as possible.  I love the power the player have over their items (storage and loot filter).

[strike]The strongest criticism I have right now is with the campaign.  It was cool but I wish I was more involved.  I don't know its weird.  The first half of the campaign was great and it felt like no time went by and all of a sudden we were at the second half.  The second half feels like the story kind of petered off and we were reacting and ""chasing"" as a character rather than leading events...Maybe it's just my personal biases with epoch stuff.  I don't know.[/strike]  Regardless I still want to play more and try a bunch of other classes and masteries.  Super excited for the necromancer release with 1.0 launching.

8/10.  Worth the price, and even the cosmetic micro-transactions.

more add: I like the face lift of 1.0.  The factions are cool.  I believe 1.0 answered some questions that I have had issues with in the Beta.

Old Review (pre 1.0):
While still being early access, the content that is present feels completely ready. This is a great ARPG for everyone that likes PoE, but also for everyone that thinks PoE is too complicated. This game has a good item chase, an easy to understand crafting mechanic that feels rewarding even though it is so simple. The spells and abilities all feel great, the monsters are pretty good.
There is still work to be done, but there are constant updates coming and the devs communicate well with us players.

-UI elements like party portraits will disappear at random.

-Map exploration resets every time you leave an area.

-Entering a new area can cause you and your party members to enter your own individual phases.

-Crafting materials go into your inventory by default instead of the material bank which you need to click its specific button for. I'm assuming this is by design so they can ""fix"" it later and pad their patch notes.

-Controller support is pretty abysmal compared to Grim Dawn or even Titan Quest and WASD movement isn't on the road map.

-Left click is somehow bugged and can't have any ability bound to it. Not sure how you release a game with such a staple of the control scheme broken that badly.

-Classes are gender locked and cosmetically static despite this not being Korean and games with lesser budgets having better character customisation.

-This is a live service game with a cash shop, nothing P2W but if we're going to hate Diablo 4 for selling cosmetics it's only fair LE gets a strike against it.

-Transmog only works for cash shop items. So I guess if dress-up is your end game LE [i]is[/i] pay to win.

-Have to use a ""gift"" menu to send items to party members because no one can see each other's loot drops, that includes items you drop out of your inventory.

Wouldnt recommend spending money on this game untill problems are fixed.

This game encourages thinking, which is awesome - skill system, crafting, items etc. Its just fun to make your build and experiment with it, you never feel like the UI is getting in the way like in another certain big ARPG that came out last year.

Graphics are very good, personally like them more than the flat grayness of D4, even if D4 has a bit better combat animations and fine details. Art style matters more imho, and Last Epoch has clearly amazing artists who were actually allowed to put some color in the game.

Anyway, if you like ARPGs even a little bit, I thoroughly recommend the game - from basic game systems point of view this is the best ARPG on the market to me. Everything can be improved later on, but if your core is faulty (IE D4) it is massively harder to pull off.

The game has a few good systems and good build diversity and skills are very customizable (you are pigeonholed into a handful of builds at endgame though) Itemization is good and so is crafting.

The gameplay is pretty bad, you get stuck randomly, your skills do not hit randomly (arrows get stuck in ground etc). It is often hard to see what is happening, black monsters in dark environment, hard to discern if monsters are dead or still alive etc. so the gameplay is more spray and pray type, no real skill or finesse.

Graphics, characters and animations are stiff and bad, they look like something from 2002. There is no feedback to your attacks, the impact is very detached and it feels off. Spell effects feels like they are 2D, they seem to not be part of the world but instead laid on top of everything else.

Its kinda in between ""Diablo Simplicity"" and ""Path of Exile (PoE) Complexity"".

Things I like about Last Epoch:
-All classes can be prestiged, Skills can be leveled up and customized, 
this way, there is a light complexity skill tree.
-It has custom crafting and runes, similar to PoE but simplified.
-Loot Filters exist, and you can import custom ones!
-There is an Endgame where you run randomized dungeons (D3 like-ish) but without the bullshit quests from D4.
-You can also modify these: Increasing your loot by increasing difficulty factors.
-Effects look good, are highly visible and distinguishable.
-A high variety in landscapes
-price is insanely generous (compared to AAA (or AAAA) games)

Critique points:
-There is no way to respec a character completely, so you would have to lvl a new one if you would want to switch prestige classes. (can skip campaign though)
-Bosses have basic mechanics and arent introduced that well. some do not feel like bosses at all
-some quests seem to be bugged

With that said cash shop stunts didn't sit well with me, so I decided to flip my rating.

[h1]Cash shop ""beta""[/h1]
[list]
[*] [strike]Cash shop sells Cosmetics for 95, 165 and 195 cash currency.[/strike] (fixed)
[*] [strike]Cash currency packs are sold in following amounts 120, 265, 755. [/strike] (fixed)
[*] 100 currency pack costs 10$. This puts the cheapeast item on the shop at 5$ and an armor skin set at 25$.
[/list] 


[b]""We listened""[/b]
They pretended like they didn't know what they did and fixed the pricing. In the same update they fixed cash currency prices to not be predatory on their own they introduced supporter packs, that play on FOMO.

[h1]Supporter Packs[/h1]
To state the obvious, these are seasonal packs that appear for a limited time and then disappear forever. This is not a 1 time thing, they are planning more of them. It's another predatory tactic that preys on FOMO (fear of missing out). 

Most expensive pack cost 50$ and [b]does not include lower tiers[/b] (not stated on official channels). If you subtract cash currency in the bundle it puts 1 item cost at about 11.6$. 

To elaborate on why I think it's bad, if you want ANY of those items
- You're pressured by FOMO
- An item costs about 11.6$ (if you subtract price of the currency). 
- Item price [i]could[/i] be considered reasonable, BUT you're also forced to buy 2 other items + currency you might not want (that by the way has questionable value).

To paraphrase their response, they justify their pricing with ""Well SOMEBODY thinks it's a great looking item and is willing to pay that much"". This indicates that if they knew somebody would pay 1000$ for that pack, then that's what it's worth and that's what they should be charging (common greedy ""value"" extraction logic).

[h1]My stance[/h1]
I don't mind micro-transactions as a whole (although it looks bad in Early Access).
I don't like predatory tactics one bit. I also don't appreciate devs feigning ignorance when called out on their obviously intentional actions.

Can you still call these ""support"" (i.e. supporting the game) if you're compelling people into spending more than they are willing to?",1678710697,1708761160,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Yes you did indeed pay for a product and you can't play it online immediately and that's unfortunate but I'll never agree with review bombing especially when these overly privileged ""reviewers"" will be no living the game anyway once server issues are fixed but leave up their misinformed reviews as a way to be ""spiteful"" or ""empowered"" behind their keyboards. This isn't a Triple A studio forcing us to to pay $100+ for a mid ass game with a broken launch. This is a smaller studio who is launching their first title ever and I'm sure has been a big learning experience for them. Also, their game got a lot of big last minute publicity before release which is in part thanks to Diablo 4 being an absolute shit game with an on going awful season, ended up getting way more eyes on their product then they were expecting. Plus, these developers in 2024 included a fully functioning offline mode that works so well. My friends and I have been running the offline mode and learning the game that way and don't mind waiting a week or two to start another character together as a four man party once the servers are functioning properly. I never leave long comments like this ever but it disgusts me the state of society and how people need instant gratification for every single little thing or their whole world goes to hell. These review bombers should just be happy the game-play is actually fucking amazing, only costs $35, and not an continually disappointing title like Diablo 4. Moral of the story is go play a different game until the servers are fixed if you can't be bothered to use the offline feature or maybe go outside and touch grass instead of tarnishing an amazing game due to understandable server issues since this was developed by a smaller studio.

This game hits a sweet spot, sitting comfortably between the complexity of POE and the accessibility of D3/D4. Sure, there are some launch-day server hiccups, but honestly, what ARPG hasn't had those? It's a minor blip in what is otherwise a finely crafted experience.

Last Epoch's skill system and time-traveling narrative are engaging, and it's clear the developers poured their hearts into it. It's a game with flaws, sure, but the pros far outweigh the cons. The great crafting experience, chase item options, and huge future potentials.

Great game. Combines what we like from Path of Ehile with the simplicity of Diablo. 
While many are unhappy with the lauch becuse it was hard to enter. Lets remind to everyone that this game is not developed by 9000 employee having bilions of dolars and still doesnt have even one successfull lauch in the last 15 years (Blizzard).
Overall developers are doing their best.
I played 20 hours in the beta. And now on the official release i am having a blast. 
Unless i change this comment that means that i am still having a blast. 
For refference in D4 i have spend 50h+ having few hardcore and softoce character but we all know the state of that game so i dont think need to mantion it. 
If there is a scale from 1 to 10. D4 being maybe 3(as the game is fine unless u want to grind a lot as the grind in it is meaningless most of the time and season are boring. but the base story and gameplay are fine). then you have last epoch which is 9.

Story and atmosphere are always appreciated, but if your game doesn't have unique and varied builds I'm gonna play the story once and drop it. And I think they actually struck a really good balance here between ""Fuck this, I'm following a guide"" (PoE) and ""Boring game for infants"" (Diablo 3/4). If I had to put it on a slider, I'd probably place it somewhere between D2 and PoE in terms of complexity. One of the things I really enjoy as a sweatlord who plays with others is that support builds are actually a thing in this game, so I get to do all my min-maxxy stuff without ruining anyone else's fun.

As far as the rest goes, it runs pretty smoothly and the newest update seems to have made the game feel a lot more responsive than it did last time I played. The story is engaging enough, but it is a letdown when you kill the boss in the desert and then the game goes ""aight, go do monoliths for awhile and you'll get more story eventually."" I'm not 100% sure if this is because they're still developing the story or if that's the intended experience. I think it's definitely a viable way of finishing the story out, but what's there now needs more work. Lastly, net play is a little unstable. It takes a long time to load into areas, and about half the time when you do your skill bar gets jumbled up for some reason, which is really awkward when you're traveling between combat zones as a druid in bear form. The studio is pretty small though, so I'm just happy it functions enough for me to be able to log in and play with people.

POST-FULL RELEASE UPDATE
------------

Okay, so setting aside the server issues (their stress test peaked at 40k concurrent users, there wasn't a snowball's chance in hell they were prepared for the 175k+ peak users they had after release), I really like the progress they've made since last time I played. The early chapters of the campaign have been reworked, and the story and pacing in those chapters is much better now. Plus, they shortened certain sections of the early story to make them *much* less tedious than they were before (looking at you, Temple of eterra). Movement and skill usage are even more fluid and responsive than last time I played, and several skills have had their animations redone, which is fantastic considering how janky some of them used to be. 

On top of that, they've finally released the last couple masteries they've been teasing for years now. Runemaster and Warlock both look amazing, and my next character will probably be one of those two. Falconer, which I've been playing since the game came out a couple days ago, is so fuckin cool, it's gonna be a very long time before I get tired and decide to roll an alt. The caltrops, the traps, the bird skills, I love all of it, this is some of the most fun I've had in an ARPG. If the other new masteries are this good, I'll be coming back for at least a couple more cycles to see what kinds of crazy bullshit I can pull off.

I'm pretty disappointed with the story still ending without any meaningful resolution. You still end up abruptly abandoning every story thread and npc you've been following for several hours to go do monoliths indefinitely. I don't know if the plan is to release more story content post release or if that will be part of the endgame, since as of right now there isn't really anything to work towards after hitting empowered monoliths. Adding some kind of pinnacle content that continues the story or at the very least gives you something to work toward beyond ""I need better gear to push harder content"" would go a long way.

Overall, the game is pretty great. What's here is already leagues ahead of whatever Blizzard is doing, and once the server issues are resolved and the devs can get working on some new endgame and story stuff, there's enough potential for this game to go toe to toe with PoE someday.

This even includes all the troubles at launch, especially around online connectivity features. I have no doubt the devs will fix the launch issues, even if it takes some time. The game design is the biggest highlight for me. It is more or less an ARPG ""sandbox"" in that it gives you a lot of tools to explore and ""solve"" a build that will easily beat the game. It has interesting skill trees, passive skills, crafting system, all of which have different ways to synergize and create interesting builds. The story is somewhat mediocre but at least ties in well to the hack n' slash genre and map farming. The graphics are also somewhat dated, which is why I compare this to D3 and not D4. 

So the game design and mechanics is carrying the game, with none of the other categories being too bad, so overall it's a good game with great potential.

2: Sometimes in between areas, a party member will get kicked from party. However, only they see themselves as kicked. So party leader then has to ""kick"" that player and reinvite. 
3: Just straight crashed once. Not sure why, so can't really provide details.

Update - The game remained unplayable for 12+ hours, and is still unstable at the time of this edit (3 days later)

The bee referral system was the worst idea in the history of any online game I've ever played, and ruined global chat launch day/week hype. I will not factor the bee chat spam into the thumbs up or down decision, but it shows the strong influence Tencent has on this game. 

I've slogged though the campaign a few times throughout early access, and was waiting for full release to give the thumbs up or thumbs down. This has been a buggy mess throughout four years of development, and the launch day fumble makes me feel ok with leaving a thumbs down. They didn't even have a queue, yet they have the audacity to state they were ""over-prepared"" for launch.

Many of the bugs from early access are still present, despite overwhelming reports from the community and false promises that they would fix the bugs before 1.0. Considering they didn't complete the campaign for the 1.0 launch and decided to roll it out with 3 chapters missing, I have to wonder what they accomplished during the several months the 1.0 launch was delayed by. Certainly not bug fixes or completing the campaign. I actually consider the missing campaign chapters a win for the playerbase, which leads me to my next point.

Ignoring the server issues and bugs, I can only recommend this game to those who prefer to play through the campaign once and then uninstall. Most games in this genre include several mechanics to accelerate progress on subsequent playthroughs (alts). The majority even allow players to skip the campaign after clearing it once. Not this game. The developers have been arrogant and argumentative when approached with this request by the community, insisting we would have more fun if we're forced to clear the tedious campaign on every playthrough. They also insist it's more fun to repeat the same dozen+ side quests, in addition to the campaign, to unlock idol slots. Imagine Diablo 4 if renown and altars weren't changed to permanent account-wide unlocks (a change met with unanimous praise). Path of Exile doesn't allow campaign skip either, but has the best endgame in this genre to make up for it. Unfortunately, Last Epoch's endgame is dull and unsatisfying. 

I've put a few hours into the 1.0 campaign during the short periods of time the servers were ""working"" (1-5 minutes of load time between zones, but at least we can log in) and it's still so boring that I can barely keep my eyes open. At least I have this game in my library should I find myself in need of a sleep aid.

I've kept a close eye on this game throughout development and really wanted to like it. It does have a few good ideas, but it seemed to have taken a totally different trajectory after they sold out to Tencent. The skill system is particularly well-done, striking a balance between the overly-simplified Diablo series and the convoluted thousand node trees in PoE. Unfortunately, the few things they got right don't make up for everything else they got wrong.

This would have been an easy thumbs up if it weren't for the anti-fun core design decisions, and plague of server issues and bugs. The 1.0 launch is finally here after four years of development and many months of delays, but apparently it still needed more time in the oven.

This game is such a breath of fresh air after the disappointment of Diablo 4, you're getting impressive almost AAA production quality work from just a small team of passionate developers. The combat is incredibly satisfying, enemy variety is healthy and encounters are unique, leveling is challenging and extremely rewarding. The gameplay systems are unique, well thought out, and very intuitive. Forging is a smart and unique system that allows you to target specific gear and craft items to synergize with your build. Personally, I am skipping through the story and just playing the game itself - the raw gameplay experience is fantastic.

I have not yet reached end-game, but from what I have heard, it's just as good.

Big Pros:
- Feels very ""Diablo"", not a difficult transition if you are used to playing Diablo
- Art is fantastic, AAA quality
- Music is solid
- Combat feels amazing (currently trying out blade dancer)
- Loot Filter is perfect
- Skill system is really smart and allows for easy customization
- SEARCH BARS FOR EVERYTHING <3

Couple of things that bug me that I want to point out (that may be fixed in the future):
- There is no way to compare an item with your offhand or secondary ring slot
- When clicking a portal to go to a new zone, there's sometimes a delay upwards of 10 or more seconds for it to register.
- Some of the portrait art on the NPCs is a bit jank
- I wish I could inspect players to see their current gear/skill tree

However, following recent events around the launch of 1.0 and the massive negative reaction the game and dev's have gotten, I wanted to express my opinion of the game itself - rather than just a short-term knee-jerk reaction to a couple of days of disruption around launch-date.

First off - the dev's response to the issues was fantastic. They were in the Discord, giving updates, answering queries from the players, etc. They were open, professional, and apologetic. Full credit to them for how they handled this (one suggestion I HAVE made to them though, is the possibility of in-game announcement of some kind to advise players of an upcoming server maintenance in order to alert those not on Discord - after the couple of days of ""server issues"" with the launch, having the maintenance happen had everyone screaming about more server issues, when it was in fact planned maintenance. But I digress...)

As for the game itself - loving it.

Pro's:
* LOOT FILTER! Omg... being able to set item types, item rarity, aspect types, etc. all as filters for what to show/not show... AND being able to highlight items with certain attributes on them in a different colour to make them stand out? How do more games not have this??
* Skill trees - yes, plural. It doesn't have a full-blown star-map like PoE, and it doesn't have a single skill tree + paragon board like D4. It has a ""passive"" tree for your primary attributes, and then a skills tree for each of your active skills. You don't need to spend hours watching videos to be able to understand your build, but the progression of the various options on each of your skills is reasonably flexible, making it actually possible to make yourself a decent build - without having to follow a guide.
* End-game activities. It's an ARPG, so there's always going to be a ""grind"". The way the team have implemented the end-game area allows you to focus farm certain types of items, etc. and the content changes (a little, at least). Am yet to spend significant time in this section of the game, but between my experience, response from others in the chat, and watching review vids etc. I am pleased with the way this works.

Con's:
* It's not as ""pretty"" as some games. Don't get me wrong - it certainly doesn't turn me off, but I know some folks are pretty picky about their visuals. Those that have a must-have of full-blown cinematic pixel-perfect graphics will need to look elsewhere.
* Load times between zones can take a little while at present. During the beta, my load times between zones were maybe 5-6 seconds? At time of writing, it's pretty much the same for me - but due to the recent (current?) issues with the release, some have been reporting (randomly) longer load times between zones. Not having experienced that myself, I am unsure if it was because they hadn't installed the latest update, or there was some other issue not directly related to the game itself. Just thought it worth mentioning, as folks looking into the game may see reports of this from some of the more vocal negative players.

Summing up - it's a great game, with some great bones to build on, and well worth playing - especially for the price. Also - no pay-to-win micro transactions, just some cosmetic stuff you can grab if you choose. If you like ARPGs, try it out - you're unlikely to be disappointed if you come into it with an open mind :)

-Enemies: Lot's of variety and huge packs. At around half way through the second chapter and beyond, you're pretty much constantly fighting outside of towns.
-LOOT: Plentiful and meaningful! No bs stats like ""2% extra damage to far enemies"".
-Crafting: Easy to get into, and rewarding to master, you can make some crazy gear in this game (rng willing).
-Loot Filter: 75 rules and tonnes of options, need I say more?
-Factions: LOOT faction ftw.
-Characters: 5 main classes with 3 sub types per, *but* the diversity that gear and idols allows in builds actually makes these numbers way higher.
-Co-op is essentially just enemies becoming sponges, so that's probably a downside for some; it's pretty fun nuking bosses with your buddies though.
-Skills: Just complex enough to allow for theory crafting, but not poe levels of needing a phd and 5 1hr videos to understand the full scope of a skill. Respecing is cheap and easy, almost like the devs understand that nobody wants to be punished for trying something new.
-Stash: The tabs are huge, customizable, and they just cost gold earned in-game. 

Overall I've really been enjoying all the new additions, can't wait for the next wave of nerfs to nuke my build from orbit!",1673675167,1708754005,True,0,0,0.392425298690795898,0,True,False,True

There is massive issues with the servers currently, it can sometimes take multiple minutes to move between areas and it gets MUCH worse when playing with friends.
you will get kicked out of game time to time, have matchmaking errors quite often and if your attempting to play with friends be prepared for some massively frustrating issues...

Me and my friends have managed to soft lock the campaign, we have had it put us in separate dungeon instances while still treating it like we were in the same instance(meaning monsters were stronger then usual while soloing a dungeon effectively) , getting stuck in broken parties that you cant leave, multiple animation bugs.

the game itself is fun but seriously, after 5 years of early access the state of the game is absolutely unacceptable.",1708751094,1708751094,False,2,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I think many of the systems were made by people who have an idea of what is good. But every other aspect is just terrible. There's so many little things that add up and it makes no difference if the game has depth or build variety when the main thing you do 95% of the genre like COMBAT, is so jank, weightless, unimpactful, and flaccid it brings every other aspect down with it. Right down to the default Unity Navmesh acceleration for AI, I am flabbergasted by the fact nobody said anything in the last 5 years regarding how uninteresting combat in general is. Random enemies have ragdoll death while others don't. There's next to no gore or feedback from powerful attacks, and it feels even worse then PoE. The constant flashing lights on hits, to the sounds attacks make all add up into a really terrible combat experience. Movement and combat as a whole is a mix between serviceable to janky. What good is all this ""depth"" if the main systems you use for the entire genre is unsatisfying?

While I understand the story is not a main draw to ARPGs, they could have at least made an effort. I am not surprised to see other reviews point out how the story is skippable and that's good. Then why even bother making one? It feels like the story is on par with a western erotic game. The character art for NPCs offer no help since they all look like they were made with AI with how uninteresting they look. The voice acting ranges anywhere from ok, to ""get the intern from accounting into the recording booth."" 

I see many people harping on D4 and treating Last Epoch to a steak dinner. But I need to address the underlying issues here. Both games have a cash shop, both games have horrible endgame content (D4 at launch did anyway), and Epoch has had a worse launch then D3 did. Not to mention people complain about the fact they can't play offline on D4, only to complain they can't play online on LE. This is coupled with the fact people hate Blizzard, and people hate any extension of Blizzard as a result. This means anything that's seen as a viable competitor is pushed onto a pedestal when the game itself is mid tier and low budget. I am not surprised to see that exact number pop up often on reviews. Mid tier is how to best explain the game. This is not me promoting D4, this is me telling both games are bad for opposite reasons. I just don't think it's right excusing one game's faults when they are the same as another that gets ragged on over and over. It just tells me people are hypocrites and can't follow their own stances and search for any ammo they can find to bring the company down.",1708749979,1708750427,False,9,6,0.522949755191802979,0,True,False,False

It's a breath of fresh air to stumble upon a gem of this caliber. With its distinct character and undeniable charm, it's clear that the developers invested their passion and dedication into creating something truly remarkable.

Addictive gameplay, It's reminiscent of the classic hack-and-slash RPGs that we all know and love, yet it brings something fresh and innovative to the table. The combat mechanics are fluid and satisfying, and there's a real sense of weight behind every swing of your weapon.

One aspect that particularly impressed me is the depth and challenge the game offers. Unlike some other titles in the genre, this game doesn't hold your hand every step of the way. Instead, it encourages experimentation and rewards strategic thinking. There's a plethora of options when it comes to character builds, each offering a unique playstyle and set of abilities. Whether you prefer to be a nimble rogue darting in and out of combat or a hulking brute wielding a massive axe, there's something here for everyone.

In conclusion, if you're on the fence about whether or not to give this game a try, I wholeheartedly encourage you to take the plunge. It's a shining example of what the genre can achieve when done right, and it deserves to be celebrated for that.

Even before trying it out, the promise of this game captured my interest. Its highly customizable skill trees, though simplified, added a level of complexity that further intrigued me. Despite the vast issues with the server connections, I decided to give Last Epoch a try, and it was everything I hoped for. What truly impressed me was the developers' remarkable commitment and transparency—an aspect that's been lacking in the gaming industry for some time.

This Isn't just any other ARPG. Its allure surpasses that of any other Action RPG I've encountered, drawing me in with its immersive gameplay and captivating world. Eleventh Hour Games (EHG) has made a lasting impression on the genre, and I eagerly anticipate witnessing further additions that enhance the game's already impressive features.

A heartfelt shout-out is due to the developers who poured their hearts and souls into this project. Amidst my own enjoyment of Last Epoch, I couldn't help but notice the unfortunate barrage of criticism directed towards the team on Discord. While the issues with the game were significant to some, the negativity was blown way out of proportion. Despite the onslaught, Judd, Eleventh Hour Games' CEO and Game Director, along with the rest of the EHG staff, exhibited remarkable commitment to their community.

Even in the face of relentless insults and unwarranted hostility, they remained steadfast in their commitment to transparency and support. Their tireless efforts to address player concerns and provide insight into ongoing issues spoke volumes about their integrity and passion for their craft. It was evident that they were not just developers, but individuals deeply invested in the success and enjoyment of their game.

In the end, the overwhelming positivity within the community serves as a testament to the exceptional quality of Last Epoch. Despite the initial hurdles, the game continues to shine brightly, thanks in no small part to the dedication and resilience of its developers. Last Epoch is a labor of love—one that I'm proud to support and eagerly anticipate experiencing for years to come.

Since then, I've gotten in every time since then and never had a DC. Other experiences may vary but that is mine.
 Stuff I like:
1) There is no pay-to-win. Microtans are for cosmetics only. Stash tabs are bought with in-game gold.
2) There is heavy emphasis on QoL features. You can tell the devs are gamers.
3) It has that feel of steady and noticeable power progression that PoE has but without the headache of that PoE skill tree (shudder).
4) The community is great. Lots of chatting, people are willing to help, and the toxic crap is minimal.

I wish it had WASD.

I would argue it is up there with the best ARPGs we have available to us atm. In its current state since launch (v 1.0) It's for sure better and more complex then D4 but at the same time MORE accessible then POE ( it's a very deep and complex game).
I'm not here to talk about ""we are collecting your data, and therefore we are a bad product/game"", but about the actual game-play and features.

+Enough different Classes and Mastery in those classes for a variety of different builds.

+Extensive class passive trees and separate skill trees but still very accessible and easy enough to understand.

+On-the-fly Crafting system that is very easy to use and understand, and yet delivers a deep boost into item stats customization ( glyphs, runes, affixes suffixes,.. ) one of the best IF not the best feature/mechanic in the game.

+Extensive stash and inventory system WITH the ability for LOOT FILTERS  xD ( kinda like POE with items having their own shape and size in a grid like inventory) where all crafting materials can be send to their own special inventory and the stash can be expanded with more stash tabs (paid with IN-GAME gold ) , with the ability to have sub category stash tabs in your stash tabs with the QoL of naming and coloring them for better organizing the stash.

+Not to long or to short of a Campaign with lots of areas and scenery to enjoy and explore , monster slashing and boss killing included xD (i like the time traveling to different Eras in different time periods as well), nice graphics with gorgeous scenery backgrounds that don't feel out of place with enough monster variety.

+Controlling your character and using skills is smooth and responsive. i am playing on EU server and since launch of v 1.0 i have not yet disconnected randomly, have had 0 lag (pretty steady 20-25 ms on server), and 0 crashes, so far. Runs very smooth performance wise with some frame drops, but nothing major in any way ( more performance optimization will come, i'm sure).  Did not encounter any bugs so far that hinder the progression of the game or my character development

+Solid enough end game ( for launch after early access) that consist of 3 things atm : 
Monolith grinding (kinda like POE mapping)
Separate Dungeons
Arena ( endless waves) with leaderbords

+ 2 very different factions , one is solo self found with passive boost for loot quality and drops, the other for trading and playing with other players ( without the passive boosts from other faction off course :p )

Conclusion: a SOLID 11/10 :p (worth its price of 35 €), sure you could argue for less, but at the end of the day this game has a lot of the positives going for it and has none of the negatives, at least for me, fun game and amazing crafting system, and don't forget, the small group of devs at EHG , not a big company with lots of devs and deep pockets, accomplished this together with a passionate community, thank you all for this game :) .

SIDE NOTE: for all the people that refunded the game because of multiple server issues  at launch: PATIENCE is a VIRTUE , it's one of those ""skills"" in real life you should master ;) , instead of being angry.
We all know by now that fully releasing a game with a multiplayer function is not an easy feat to accomplish (and comes with its share of troubles), and i give credits to the developers here that they have been very transparent with info since launch that they are trying to resolve the issues as fast as possible, with quick fixes as well. By Friday evening ( 24 feb) the loading times for transitioning to another zone has been substantially reduced (with constant feedback and updates from the devs). 

I agree that loading into another zone could take up to 10 minutes or give you the LE-61 Failed to match make error, but it never disconnected me back to the character select screen, and while they are trying to resolve the issues, i could still play and continue the campaign without any lag or rollback on my progression.
Sure enough online co op was out of the question with the loading times for transitioning into another zone or a town, but the servers only went down went they implemented a hotfix trying to resolve the issue , so except for the loading times and not being able to play co-op, still enjoying the game and having a blast knowing that these issues will be resolved quick enough by a passionate team of devs at EHG.

Hopefully this helps! enjoy",1708746480,1708746480,True,15,0,0.622772574424743652,0,True,False,False

Which means, that we get a game with very fun systems when it comes to character skill progression and skill progression.

Every base class has 3 advenced classes which gives this game a huge replayability in terms of sub-class selection.  Furthermore if u spec for one subclass, u can still choose around 1/2 of the other subclasses skills. That's a unique mechanic on its own.

All skills have their own update tree, which only adds to the complexity of the builds, one can make.

RPG game systems (concerning character developmenet)  are solid, polished and player oriented. Pure fun :)

This alone in my opinion is worth the price.

My play time is 5h. 1,5h is in solo game because I cant get to online content on launch. Dont want to play OFFLINE. 3,5 h is trying to connect to an ONLINE game.

I'd been holding off playing for a few days days, since I don't want to make an offline character, then have to re-do the whole thing online. Feels like a big waste. I also really wanted to try out the trade league mechanics. I had a hundred-something hours over the past few years before the release, with endgame characters in most playstyles, so I was pretty familiar with what I was going to get.

Devs, you guys did some amazing work between the last patch and this one. The graphics are hugely improved. Things feel smoother, the ""feel"" and sound of the graphics and sense of weight is improved. The difficulty is more balanced, and hard enough, even early-game, with a so-so build to not go on full auto-pilot and still have some work to do. As always, itemization is among the best in the genre.  

I am -really- disappointed that the awesome work that went into this patch is getting overshadowed by the catastrophic server issues. At this point, I'm just going to ignore online stuff for the foreseeable future. Most of my playtime prior to this has been single-player anyway, so it'll at least be familiar. If you're only looking for online play, give it a few days- maybe a few weeks and check back in. I am sure that this will be a resolved issue in not too long, just wish it didn't obscure the great work that is behind that mess!",1708744462,1708744462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

***UPDATE***
Day 3 - Looks like not all the $$$ they made on the Steam sales went to hookers and cocaine.
After a couple of grueling days it seems like they nailed the server instability issues.

They kept us up to date thru the process of game launch.  I think that says a lot for game dev company.

I'm glad I supported them Early Access, and with a supporter pack.
The game has gotten a lot of polish and looks really nice.

My only grip is with the controller support. I prefer to use a Playstation 5 controller, which does work thank to Steam Input. However, navigating menus with the controller does not work well. I find that I need to switch to my mouse just to be able to access specific skills. Additionally there are times that I cannot get my character to face specific directions while attacking. I get stuck facing away from enemies and need to move around to get my mage to turn and attack the right direction. It's nothing that I can't work around but I would be grateful if better controller support was added. 

Also, there is a strange issue where enemies can occupy the exact same space as my character. While in that position, they can attack me, but I cannot hit them.

What I do care about as consumer is some sense in game design and especially in interface and controls. And after 20+ years of  innovation or lack there of in the genre ARPG, for some unknown reason this developer decided instead of copying the wheel putting some nice decoration on the side it would be fun to reinvent it by making it close to square and presenting it as features.

Alright on to the review.

I personally have little to no tolerance for companies that think they can ignore any established law. (Yes they are a pain as company just suck it up and deal with it respect your customers, visitors and users).

EULA is your standard legal mess and does not correctly reflect what is collected  while running the application as it mixes both site use and application telemetry, non essential analytics. 

Again violation of GDPR. As datacontroller you need to have separate privacy policies per product, service for your data-subjects to review. (This is why you hire legal terms and condition specialized lawyers).

Alright boring stuff out of they way on to the next category.


[h3]Game design and gameplay[/h3]
Hold position button missing completely. (same for party members, pets, summons)

No defense, aggressive stance options for your minions. (they mindlessly aggro all that comes near).

No auto attack option.

Rebinding mouse controls can only be partially done on the game screen. For all other buttons except right-click you have to use the option menu. Great fun when you have a mouse with more than 3 buttons like most ARPG gamers have as input peripheral and want to swap around with attacks.

Controller functionality subpar. Buttons not working if you can get your controller even working that is.

No option to show all details during item compare without having to hold both Ctrl and Alt modifier keys while hovering over a single item on default keyboard layout. want to see weapon range well to bad. First you have to hold Ctrl and Alt. because for some reason that is not a important enough attribute according to the game to see upfront.

No inventory sorting options. There is a inventory sort button but what it does no idea. It is not explained or labeled. (no sort by type, weight, rarity or even value) Even if you do press the button it is the worst attempt at efficient organizing I ever seen in a ARPG. It even leaves gaps in between items instead of neatly closing any gaps which is just baffling.

Loot filters are there and advanced but no option to auto pickup the loot you just filtered. So you are still clicking on every drop which makes a loot filter rather less efficient. Worse it was by design to have the players make more conscious pickup decisions. I call it wasting my time. (Note gold currency does auto pickup thankfully)

Outpost, city stash has tab function with labeling but no auto sort function to bind it to. Want all your shields in one container better start dragging them all manually to it.

Attack feedback is poor. It is very hard to see what your character is doing exactly unless we are talking about ranged combat. But even certain spells especially acolyte are so tiny of a effect it is almost impossible to see its effect because a enemy effect completely obscures it. 

Camera distance, height and angle are subpar. Especially when dealing with enemies at the north of your current position targeting becomes a pain. Isometric was a design choice and understandable. Having bad visibility how ever is not.

NPC dialogue is bad to average on actual script and delivery. Beside a very select amount of NPC's and the introduction cut-scene. Story plot especially in first chapter contradicts itself.

NPC's say stuff that does not reflect the scene atmosphere you would expect. Worse dialogue options do not reflect which progress the content and which are optional. 

When a NPC or a object has been activated and all dialogue is exhausted and seen at least once there is no way of knowing this later on. This is due to the map icon not showing any change. Expect  to run multiple times around as a headless chicken if you think you missed out on dialogue especially from static objects like papers or corpses.


[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
After about 3 hours game-play in release 1.0 and having 5+ years of development time with community feedback and waiting for to get to a acceptable product *I give up on this product*

These were the bigger issues that you run into all the time. Things like Texture glitches, invisible enemies are all things I consider minor because they will get fixed with ease. The things mentioned above how ever are not so easy to fix or simply to late or developers are to stubborn to think they are required.

If this was designed by ARPG loving developers as marketed than I do not want to know what torture device they would have delivered if they were not ARPG fans. Try it if you want maybe they actually added features in the future who knows. I really hope so for you potential future buyers,

The people leaving negative reviews right now are moronically impatient, and the actual game itself do not deserve it. If you do not expect server issues on launch day, especially when a humble indie-title explode in popularity like this, you must be very very new to the internet.
The game is a brilliant little ARPG which already offer more replayability than titles like D4. Conversely it is not nearly as complex as PoE, so it is fine to jump in blind and make your own build as you go along. Systems are intuitive and it has the best crafting-system ever introduced to an ARPG so far. 
It is also rare to see a dev-team so in tune with their audience and so involved with the health of their product, so even though the game is not perfect, the future of the game is looking bright.
If you are having second thoughts or doubts, you may wait 2-3 days for server capacity to be upgraded, and the crybabies who have to wait a little to play a game to stop seething, but I have had no issues with online play in offpeak-hours as of writing this review.

It has pretty much everything I like of Diablo 3, Path of Exile, and TQ/Grim Dawn wrapped into one package, with little I dislike and some extra QoL improvements on the side. Highly recommend, even in early access so long as they don't mess things up.

Full review:
The game has, in my honest opinion, the perfect level of depth for a game of the genre. It manages to have a manageable level of complexity, without being overwhelming. To properly explain, let me go into specifics.

Builds/Build diversity:
The game is all about playing around with various synergies to boost the effectiveness of your overall setup. This can range from abilities that boost damage or other stats, to abilities that create a flow in your playstyle with a satisfying result. Your 1st character or 2 may not be as powerful as you'd like, but the game really opens up once you know how things work.

Crafting:
Easily one of the most straight-forward components of the game. As you play: you get gear and shards. These shards can be used to put SPECIFIC STATS on gear, instead of being completely random or focused but random. As well: there are various runes that can modify gear, or break it to give you a random amount of their shards back. The only limiting factor in it is the ""instability"" mechanic that gives you a chance to fracture equipment the more you mess with it. It won't make an item unusable, and most of the time: it'll simply make it to where you can't mess with the item further. Rarely does it actually hurt the item properly. Oh, almost forgot to mention: Crafting can be done from anywhere with no time/currency restrictions, making it handy for when you get the next tier of item but it doesn't have the stats you want.

Gameplay:
It'd be best compared to Path of Exile in terms of actual gameplay. It has very similar pacing, as well as ability functionality. Each class has a very distinct feel, without being tied down to a single playstyle. Being a Necromancer doesn't mean you'll just be a glorified beacon for undead who does nothing themselves, you have plenty of options involving several unit types and interactions where you can have an active role in combat.

Visuals: Not incredible, but I'd say it's ""On Par"" with similar games.

Sounds: Decent enough.

Content:
Could be more diverse, but is passable in its current early access state. If you're looking for a game that you can just turn on and enjoy without the content being overly complicated: The amount of content is fine for the time being.

Quality of Life:
Not something I'd normally have as its own category, but there's enough here to justify it. 1st and foremost: A BUILT-IN LOOT FILTER! Yes, you don't have to download a mod to have a loot filter! As well: you can set it up to be as simple or complex as you want, and is incredibly easy to use. Want a certain staff with spell damage and fire damage rolled on it? Simple: Just choose the staff type, set what stats you want on it, and even the tiers of the rolls it should have. You can set it up to emphasize the name of the item you're looking for, change the name color of it, or simply hide all other item drops! My only gripe is that there's no option to tell the game that the implicit or affix rolls should be of a certain threshold. Loot filter aside: Just about everything has a search function, so it's not hard to find any stats you want from your abilities and skill trees, or even items in your stash (if you're as disorganized as me), and there's also an in-game guide that's always available to give you any information you need. Also, going back to the crafting for a sec: The crafting system allows you the freedom fix up your character as needed, preventing you from hitting a wall because you forgot to bump up your defenses a bit. There are a few other smaller (but highly impactful) QoL changes, but I'll leave it there.

Developers:
Also not a topic I normally bring up, but I'm genuinely impressed with how they've handled things. They realized that saying they'll have a major update consisting of a long list of things at a specific date was a great way to shoot themselves in the foot, and create distrust in the playerbase, and decided to take a more suitable route. Instead, they say ""Here are the major things we want to take priority, we'll have more information after we iron things out"". Not to say they aren't transparent at any other point though, as they do monthly blog posts regarding what they're working on, as well as reveals when specific things are on their final stage of development. Absolutely top-notch way of going about things.

Overall: I love the direction the game is going, and hope the devs keep it up. Easily my favorite ARPG out there, without a doubt. Fingers crossed hoping the multiplayer has a smooth release, as they already have the game balanced around the idea of further synergies between classes.

Edit 2/23/2024:
This is meant less as an update as to my thoughts on the game, as they're mostly the same. It has improved in many ways, with only one or 2 questionable (balance) changes. The visuals are definitely a lot better than when I originally wrote this. The servers seem to be doing a lot better after today's fixes, if you wanted to know how that's going.

As for the main reason I'm writing anything new at all, a bit of a letter to the devs:
You guys have been doing fantastic. You could never have anticipated reaching nearly 200k players within a few days of launch, I am not even slightly irritated about the server issues. But despite that: You have managed to very quickly fix things up to where it is plenty playable again. Hats-off to you, honestly. Make sure to give yourselves a vacation or at least a bit of time off once things have settled down, you've d*mn well earned it!

Sincerely, a player who is more than happy to see how far things have come, and wishes all of you at the studio a very pleasant day. :)",1629511567,1708741829,True,0,0,0,4,True,False,True

This game seems pretty interesting, but I feel like I can't get into anything because every map load is a pain.  If it's not a disconnect, extremely long loads, it will be that you just don't load into the same map as your allies.  So you'll need to reload again.

Aside from being able to play the game, I do have a couple of other thoughts:

+ Character customization seems, as every other online viewer as stated, more than D4, but less than PoE, mostly only in a positive sense.
+ New animations look great.
+ Environment is great so far, in terms of appearance and graphics.  I personally really liked the color palette chosen.
+ Loot filter is great & easy to set up.
+ Not a difficult game to adapt to in terms of being able to understand how to play.  (Other than if you try to equip a two handed weapon while you have anything in your offhand, there is no indicator to tell you that you need to unequip the offhand first)

Some of the negative thoughts (other than connectivity issues):
- In my personal opinion, combat feels floaty, disconnected, and sometimes disjointed.  I haven't played much at all, so it could just be new player experience.  It doesn't feel like attacks are making impact and stuff just kind of dies around you as you have attacks just spraying in AoE cones all over the place.  For example, Riposte is just an AoE cone ability for some reason where you just spray physical attacks as if it was spray paint.  It doesn't feel good.  Most abilities I've encountered feel this way (again, 5 hours played at time of writing, so keep that in mind).
- Super subjective, but I absolutely hate the music.  I almost never turn off music in games because I personally feel that there was time and effort that went into creating an immersive environment and music almost always should support that immersion.  I don't know how to articulate it very well without being offensive, so I'll just say that I disliked it greatly.
- Similar disclaimer as above, but the voice acting is atrocious.  I would rather they have saved a few dollars, went text-only, and used the investment somewhere else for other improvements.  One or two of the main characters are...""okay"".  Almost everything else you come across, even down to random NPCs screaming, it totally immersion breaking.  Nothing quite like a birdman flying down out of the sky sounding like the most generic human you've ever heard.  Some sort of solar dudes in full metal plate armor, including face masks who sound like they're in a budget recording studio, or lowest bidder from Fiverr.  Actually.  I imagine what happened was that they had a decent-ish mic and just stood in a corner with egg cartons and had the devs record their own voices.  I have to say, great cost-cutting, but again, I'd rather have my devs doing dev things.  

It's stuff like today's announcement of how it's basically all hands on deck to fix server stability issues and then the last sentence of that paragraph says that they pulled the art and design folks over to help out.  What the heck does that mean?  Do I REALLY want an artist working in a technical capacity that determines whether or not my playerbase can access the game??  Maybe it was phrasing and what they meant was ""Art guy is getting coffee for the folks in the trenches.""  I'd understand in this case, but oof.  

I want to like the game.  Heck, I want to PLAY the game, but going in and out of loading screens until you finally appear in the same map as your friends is not featured gameplay.

The connectivity and loading issues on launch are unfortunate, given the outstanding quality of many features and systems in the game. There are a lot of wins here. One of them, the full offline mode, has saved the excitement of the launch for me. Other wins include:
- Build diversity: there seem to be a tonne of viable and fun ways to play, with many genre archetypes and new twists,
- A crafting system with more depth than complexity, which is meaningful from campaign to end game,
- Multiple target farming systems,
- A built in, and rather elegant, loot filter,
- Dungeons, Arenas, and Monoliths form a three pronged end game, and should serve as a solid base for growth.

Update for 1.0 launch. Ok yes the launch had its share of server issues but let’s face it what game and launch doesn’t nowadays. But the issues were quickly addressed and communication and transparency were a 10/10. Constant and regular updates from the dev team kept the community informed on what was going on. I’m talking every 30 minutes we got updates. That in itself was unheard of. When you have a team of 90 people dealing with a launch of this magnitude what they accomplished was impressive. Within minutes of launch they had 150,000 players logged in. We have hit 197,000 as of me writing this. The new graphics are way better than early access and the new cutscenes are nice. New stuff has also been added into the different areas as you go through the campaign. But again please don’t let the negative reviews about servers and not being able to play a day after launch determine whether or not you play this game. Because that’s something you will regret. We all need to realize these things happen now. And as of now most of the issues have been resolved or at least significantly improved and they are still working on patches for a few remaining issues. But for the most part they have worked tirelessly to fix the big issues. They aren’t a multi billion dollar company with thousands of employees. They are a indie company started from Reddit just a few years ago with people who never made a game before. For most this is there first launch. It really is impressive.

It's got a unique cool concept regarding time and you'll be time traveling back and forth in this one! Despite that, they don't have pistols, flintlocks or muskets/rifles as a weapon in this, kind of disappointing.

It has been a few years, rough years. And now it's looking and playing a lot better, can't wait for the actual release and blow-up everywhere for this game. Only concern is Diablo IV is coming this year as well, and I want this to have it's moment, so a release before then would be the best for this game. Or if Diablo IV isn't doing well, the timing could be everything for this title. GO!

As for Diablo IV, I'm not so concerned anymore. As the classes are boring and depth of the game isn't there. So this actually has a nice shot.

Only issue I've come across are related to controls, I rebound middle mouse for walk-to, but I do want walk and attack on ONE button. 
And second thing: this only has about 5 skills you can mix and match (5 you can specc into but not always do you have to have them on your bar, as other skills can trigger them), while Diablo has 6, some MMOs have 9 or even more. I wish there was more situational skills. For instance let us get the class spell for free, as an ""ultimate"" and leave the rest of the 5 as they are. Wolcen did nice in this, opening up another skillslot as you farmed for it at endgame.

Edit: While the game is generally fun and deep. There are some BIG issues, which so far, the devs have mostly ignored. While making some promises.

And as of late the servers are really soiling themselves, not porting you into the next area, just standing there dripping of piss. And there's huuuge balance problems, this is pre-release. So we all live on hopium, hoping they'll fix everything. But I have kinda lost faith in this. This close to release, it's one of many huge concerns. So servers and imbalanced classes, there's also things like bosses doing lightning damage or water damage. Those does NOT use the resistance system. Meaning if you stack cold and lightning resist, you'll take just as much damage from those attacks. This is logic 101 in most other aRPGs! So many concerns and red flags with this developer.

Edit2: Release. And no, they have huuuge server problems, days after release. and also annoyingly the skill trees has nodes conflicting with eachother, so how would you know they conflict, you really don't know to what extent it's gimping you. It doesn't lock you into taking ONE node over another, it doesn't say they conflict. So either lock the nodes that doesn't fit together, make them work together somehow OR make a third option once you have combined the two, three or four conflicting nodes.

For instance, you can make Healing Hands be a melee fire attack, and you can make it be a charge, and you can even get it so it's a channeled ability. So which is the ""dominant"" node? And so you could have it so it charges with the melee attack at the start or end if combined. Or if combined with channel ability, once held down it doesn't charge but channels. Or something.. And like Rebuke, getting two charges? Why when the ability is a hold down ability (to consume damage delt to you), but once that breaks it instantly uses the second charge for lols.. Devs have done some serious things which causes problems. Javelin has same issues, using it as a Battleflag, why choose it have it rain down multiple javelins? Why combine it with lightning damage when they rain down, why have it split but not pierce, when Battleflag choice doesn't combine with that? And if several things doesn't combine, where the hell to put the points then? Desperately respeccing to find viable combinations, isn't a huge deal, but frustrating. having enemies pick up the Battleflag has various results, sometimes when they die they drop it again, so it can last its duration, sometimes not, why have + duration then?",1678801553,1708737527,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

A lot of the game is building a character and the most ""official"" source of how subskill interacts with tree nodes are left to be found in reddit: https://old.reddit.com/r/LastEpoch/comments/11zmz83/last_epoch_needs_consistency_sub_skills_are_broken/jddovlg/

This isn't counting the fact that the things are broken all the time devs have the most passive take on bug fixing. You can find reports of Smite's Fissure subskill not working with Sacrifice all the way back in 2021. Guess what, it's finally fixed, 3 years later in 1.0. That's about one quarter of Smite's skill tree left unusable because they do things to Fissure which wasn't worth taking since it dealt less than 1/3 of the expected damage.
That's good news right? No, because I tested and another known bug (Flammable Toxins not working with Cinder Strike subskill) is still there. Who knows how many more bugged skill nodes are there?
Essentially you're still playtesting as per 1.0 for the games and praying that there aren't bugs that break your build. And given the track record it will take 3 years to fix those again.
You think I'm cherrypicking? Pick Primalist and cast the wolf. Now put the Summon Wolf skill icon to another location on the hotbar. Now the new skill icon doesn't have access to the Wolf Howl ability. This bug has been around since the start of development 5 years ago. The developers have a very curious process about prioritization. Nobody is asking for bugs to be fixed in 1 day but come on, there are gameplay affecting bugs that are around for years to half a decade.",1636486545,1708736672,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

If you're looking for the nice middle ground between the complexity of Path of Exile and the casual progression of Diablo 4, Last Epoch is the perfect middle ground. You can make just about any build endgame viable, the campaign is interesting but not arduous, the visuals are excellent, and the quality of life features are some of the best in the genre.

The endgame itself is way more fleshed out than a lot of other ARPGs, second only to Path of Exile in my mind. The Monolith system is akin to Maps more so than something like Rifts or Nightmare Dungeons, but they allow for tons of replayability and advancement. Dungeons add a ton of gameplay elements to the endgame, such as being able to merge items into items with Legendary Potential, making truly unique and insane items.

The launch was a little rough, but not nearly as bad as many people have made it out to be. It's Day 3, and after the most recent patch the game is running smooth as silk for me.

I've seen a lot of games, I've played a lot of games, and let me tell you, not many can compare to this one. It's got everything – the graphics, the gameplay, the depth. It's like nothing else out there, believe me.

And the gameplay, it's phenomenal. So many games today, they're easy. They hold your hand the whole way through. But not Last Epoch. It challenges you, it makes you think. It's got depth, strategy. You can't just breeze through it; you've got to actually play it, and I love that. It's about time we had a game that doesn't treat its players like they're clueless.

The developers, they've done an amazing job. They're like the very talented people – the best, really – who know what they're doing. They listen to the community, they make updates, they fix things. It's like they really care about making the game great. And it shows. You can tell they're not just in it for the money; they want to make something special. And they have, believe me.

In conclusion, Last Epoch is a winner. It's got everything you could want in a game – great graphics, challenging gameplay, dedicated developers. It's a model for what other games should strive to be. It's making gaming great again, and I absolutely recommend it to everyone. You're going to love it, folks. It's truly something else.

I give credit where credit is due. Last Epoch has turned out to be an amazing game! I can see the love and effort these developers have put into it. The fact that it has TRUE OFFLINE play is reason enough to recommend this game all the way to the moon!

While I maintain my criticism of the questionable microtransactions and the use of a shady currency(I firmly believe that MTXs are a blight and a plague on our gaming community), I recognize that this alone is not enough to condemn the excellent game that Eleventh Hour Games has given us.

Last Epoch has become my new go to ARPG. Bravo!

Yes, I do understand the game just launched but excuses like ""but this happens with every game launch stop crying"" need to just stop.

This is 2024, with AWS/Google Cloud scalability this should not be happening. Especially when Last Epoch can't even handle 160-170k concurrent players. Yes, having a few hours of instability is fine, but nearly 2 days later with no fix in sight is unacceptable. And no, I DON'T want to play OFFLINE. 

I'm not saying the Devs are self-sabotaging - it's just pure incompetence at this stage.

I might change my review in the future as I do really like LE and I DO want it to succeed but I can't recommend it in it's current state.

This game has immense potential. Only 29 hours in and loving it. 

Yes, it's not perfect but keep in mind it's still on patch 0.9 (beta). The most recent patch that released only a couple of days ago along with Multiplayer was the team's biggest (and best, IMO) patch yet.

The game itself has evolved MASSIVELY in the last few years and just shows how passionate the (small) dev team is. Really puts other studios (especially triple AAA) to shame.

I really do hope the game continues on this current trajectory as it deserves it. The high amount of negative reviews the game received recently are, for the vast majority, due to server issues upon 0.9 implementation as the servers imploded with the huge influx of new people.

Gameplay is ""meh"", ""Action"" RPG with the action of a 2003 game at best

Probably most people already knew the online server is basic not playable since 1.0 launched. Actually, I realize the server problem is way longer than this after I tried offline game mode. I first start playing before 1.0 launch in online mode. Quickly, I notice the unusual long loading and waiting when I changed maps. I thought it was the engine or coding problem behind the game until I tried offline game. There is no waiting issues in offline mode, so this game has a history of server problems.
Therefore, why the F are EHG knowing the problem for so long, and doing nothing? I have to give a negative review, not because of 1.0 launch drama, but they knew the problem long time ago, and did not fix it until it becomes a nuclear explosion.
If you are trying to build a modern online ARPG, please take the server problem seriously.[/strike]

Update:
They fix the server, at least for US Central, and it is even better than beta, very close to offline mode.
Now it is a solid APRG, and worth to play.
Just a reminder, for new players, you do not have to start with a build guide from other people. The skill and class system is not as complex and punished as POE,and very interesting and worth to try out all skills.

I find it highly insulting that the developers think this bug riddled mess of a game in its current state constituted a release build worthy of the 1.0 release title.

I quit playing the game over 6 months prior to the 1.0 release date to give them time to work out most of the bugs I'd encountered and to allow for a fresher experience. When I came back to the game upon official release, I was absolutely crushed to find that nearly every bug I encountered almost a year ago is still operating at full force. Simple UI and control issues that should've been ironed out as soon as they cropped up. I have to question whether the devs actually play their own game, because as a developer myself, I find it rather difficult to comprehend the idea that anyone playing a game with such nerve wracking control issues - particularly on controller - could ever be comfortable with letting them slide under the radar for any length of time, let alone a year.

In short, and for the above reasons stated among a myriad other complaints I have about the game, I feel everyone who is currently considering picking up LE should avoid it until the developers actually start paying attention and fixing the game.

I honestly believe that this is a strategic release to anticipate PoE 2 and future D4 expansions that will monopolize the market, and even Titan Quest 2 and future Grim Dawn expansions that could distract ARPG fans from Last Epoch. 
I must believe this because it's frankly ridiculous to release an uncooked product like this and sell it as if it were version 1.0.

I'm not considering the server disaster, which is frankly the worst ever to happen in the gaming industry, but I'm playing in full offline mode so I don't care.

The problem is that there are far too many issues besides the servers. 

The whole game is filled with typos and even grammatical mistakes, placeholder/recycled icons, very debatable respec mechanics that punish you without giving actual freedom to experiment, lack of fully voice-acted NPCs, and minor bugs. The world is aesthetically/artistically dead; it's all a copy-paste from Diablo 3 mainly. 

The story is undoubtedly hideous, even for ARPG standards. The world design is ""basic"" to be fair; you just have to run from zone A to zone B in empty territories with nothing to do. It just feels like I'm constantly speedrunning even if I'm not. 

Combat feels very inconsistent; sometimes there are slow animations like in D4, so you think it's a methodical, more tactical ARPG, then other animations appear in a fraction of seconds in a big area you can't even avoid damage. The whole ""idea"" behind skill personalization is basically an expanded version of D3's runes system, served with an unintuitive UI so you have to read every single modifier without having a global understanding of what is where. Masteries are nothing new for the ARPG enthusiast; they are just passive-only editions of Titan Quest and Grim Dawn Masteries.

On the other hand, combat is fun and quite smooth. Mob density reaches a whole new level, and frankly, sometimes it can be really fun.

I suggest buying this only if you are a sucker for the genre and knowing you are buying a very indie/low-budget/cheap game.",1708733412,1708733480,False,4,0,0.485249251127243042,0,True,False,False

So this review is for singleplayer gamers.

The offline setting that you can choose at startup works flawlessly. i have quick load times, no crashes, no bugs, offline is absolutely perfect. No fps drops, no complaints. I can play when I want, pause when I want. 

As for mechanics, Crafting has a little depth to it, but you don't need to go check a wiki. For every skill or item, you can hold alt to get an expanded explanation of everything about it. This also helps with putting your build together. From the very start, you can see every mastery passive skill tree, as well as examine individual abilities. 

You get a starting mastery and choose one additional mastery early on, and can specialize into up to 5 abilities. Specializing lets you adapt skills to a variety of builds. There's just too many options to even describe. I spent a few hours just reading through all the options before choosing, but if that's not fun for you don't worry. Respec is cheap and easy from the very start. Just start blasting and figure it out later. You also have a shared stash between characters, so if you want to try something else or send a cool unique to another character, you can. There's also the option of SSF with no sharing if you want the challenge.

The gameplay is smooth and fun. Very solid action, good visual and sound effects. I recommend warlock curse/DOT build, it's very flashy and satisfying. Really awesome to just spread plague through a pack of bad guys. 

Pretty graphics, great sound design. Lots of level and enemy variety so far. The lore and voice acting are pretty good too. Very worth it right now if you don't care about online and you like the genre.",1708732972,1708732972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, it's frustrating. However, the VAST majority of those issues are systemic issues with servers that have nothing to do with the actual game itself. The standalone offline version of the game is fine. The game itself is fine. Are there bugs? Sure. Are they bad enough to warrant a negative review? Definitely not. For anyone wanting an actual OBJECTIVE review of the game, keep reading:

I've dipped my feet in and played sporadically during beta. I've got 500 hours on record total. I've seen the changes that have come out and how they've impacted my experience. As for the launch version of the game, EHG has done a GREAT job of making the game more interesting. The graphical updates are outstanding. The gameplay itself was never bad, it was just buggy during beta and most of that has been resolved. There are still isolated issues, but EHG is doing a great job of resolving those.

Now that I'm in monoliths, I can say the overall feel of the game has changed. It used to be more of a slog. Now, it's much more interesting. I don't know if it's the transitional effects, the lengths of the monoliths, or whatever it is. I just don't find myself feeling like I'm mindlessly repeating the same thing over and over like I did sometimes feel in beta. I think they've done a great job here and I look forward to future content.

On the opposite end of that, I'm not so thrilled with some of the difficulty changes. Due to EHG making overall challenge levels higher across the board, there are VAST differences in power level between characters that are built well and Willy Wonka builds that are just thrown together with no real planning. This is actually a bad change in my opinion because it encourages more people to be meta slaves and play the same handful of builds that are ""proven"" instead of experimenting, as experimenting with ideas often has brutally punishing results. A specific example of this are the density increase has made summoner mobs spawn creatures ENDLESSLY and too quickly. If you lack the damage to dispatch these creatures quickly, you will absolutely get overwhelmed and absolutely mobbed by huge packs of creatures. Also, because targeting of some skills is also directional and the summoners like to hide out in the middle of the pack, once that pack size grows, the summoner itself becomes almost impossible to actually hit, compounding the issue even further.

Overall, on a scale of 1-10 I would give this game in its current state (server issues aside) about a 7. It's decent, but it has a lot of room to grow and get better. I'd like to see some of the skills get reworked to be made a little stronger and some of the other skills that are clearly OP brought back in line with others. I think this is a massive problem in ARPGs in general. The floor is too low and the ceiling is too high leading to very little diversity and at any given time you have very little real diversity because one node is 10x the power level of another.

Anyway, I like what I see so far. I do recommend. And I look forward to seeing what's next!",1708731804,1708731804,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

An enemy from above from an area I could not access nor target. 
Thanks. No. 
I also had a random wallpiece, the size of a whole screen standing in the middle of map where I couldn´t see the enemies behind but they could shoot and walk through that wallpiece. Seriously???
Also, long loading times in zones? That was an issue throughout all of the beta. I was trying to be understanding the first day of server issues...but it has been 3 days and IF the online mode is running at all, then it simply plays the same way as in the beta - five minute loading screens per zone. WE TESTED THIS FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS FOR YOU IN THE BETA. I REPORTED HUNDRED OF BUGS AND IF ANYTHING THE RELEASE VERSION IS SO FAR IF ANYTHING JUST AS BUGGY AS ANY OF THE BETA VERSIONS. LITERALLY BASIC ""SKILL DOES NOT REACH EDGE OF THE MAP"" STUFF. HALF OF THE ONES I REPORTED STILL PERSIST ON TOP OF ALL THE NEW ONES! I PUT IN 60 HOURS OF PRACTICE FOR AN ONLINE RACE THAT DOES NOT WORK EVEN AFTER 3 DAYS. ONLINE WAS A FEATURE THAT WAS ADVERTISED AND IT CAN NOT BE PLAYED AS A HC CHARACTER.

Honestly expected more from the release. Server problems can always happen. 
But in between LE61 error and the game randomly closing on me every hour...there is also bugs that I reported years ago already. Warpath still can´t target enemies on the edges of a map, lunge can get you stuck in animation until you find a viable target to redirect to while you are helpless just randomly stopping in motion. Some of the NPC visuals still look like pre-alpha with textportraits not depicting the actual NPC onscreen (Maceth and Leyda especially but there are enough others as well which is just such a simple thing to expect from 1.0). Some random side rooms are still not named properly or not tying into anything as was speculated in the EA. The minimap overlay is not working properly at times, zooms out so much that one can only see flickering over the whole screen or making it obscure stuff onscreen and giving you a flashbang if unlucky. And while appreciated, the visual updates on some of the early void infused locations look really nice now, they also have very weird kinda wobbly interactions with movement skills bouncing you around wildly like you´re on a flicker strike simulator. On top of that, even on character found soloruns there is still tons of unuseable exclusive class items dropping which obviously makes no sense at all and just feels bad when fighting an enemy and it drops an item that is literally unuseable for you. And obviously the story was always layed out for more acts than the 1.0 version has but it just feels off playing the same unfinished story as in EA. On that note, why are there still lore notes found where enemies can attack you from offscreen while reading them.
The one actual saving grace of 1.0 - when it is working, the online mode is working much smoother than it did in EA.

And in the end there is my personal gripes with the skill system. Clearly I like the game. Clearly there is enough to do and explore in terms of builds. But I truly wish there was more freedom to explore ideas in this system. Most stuff is literally ""balanced"" by locking the option away. Taking echo chance for example is not even doable on any other character but even on any other subclass than the Voidknight it doesn´t make sense to take it. That´s not balance, that´s just restricting. ""Millions of different builds""...yeah, try 4-5 per subclass rather. Guess I always hoped that throughout the EA phase that feature of locking every viable exploration of doing something actually personal behind subclasses would get scrapped just as the idea of ""fighting echos/shadows/whatever of your endless possible future forms"" to unlock the subclass got scrapped and now its just a textbox ""choose wisely I guess"".

And to a lesser degree since runic invocation got released, which is indeed a fantastic skill breaking the mold, I do gotta say: yes, this game sports all the usual playstyles one would come to expect from an ARPG, there is your volatile minion exploder, there is your aura damage build, there is your spin to win...but honestly, most of the times I am bored with how generic my builds end up playing. With only five buttons it usually comes down to some variation of: Q-random buff/utility ability, W or right-click: the mob clear ability, E - the movement skill, R - the big damage button. Like said, some builds break the mold, runic invocation specifically as a skill is fantastic although most the times it also comes down to the functionality of either trashclear or big dmg button, but still, that one is actually breaking the mold and that is appreciated. The rest tho...I was playing a bladedancer rogue and I literally almost didn´t find use for 5th skill to level up because nothing actually added any valuable gameplay aspect to my build. Everything that would have been able to do something that I would have appreciated having was character or subclass locked and as such unavailable. And so I play my 8th build with Q-random buff/utility ability, W or right click-trash clear, E-movement skill, R-big damage button...millions of different builds...


It´s still a fun game, I´ll still give it a positive review eventually, I´m sure. But for now I´m just pretty disappointed with the 1.0 release. And that kinda hurts me to say honestly. 
Better wait a few weeks, see how it goes by then. Because when this game wants to be good it has the potential to be a lot of fun...right now tho, that is talk I would have rather not had to resort to in the 1.0 version anymore.",1708569262,1708731370,False,5,1,0.432691335678100586,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★☆
""Last Epoch"" stands as a testament to what ambitious game design and a passion for the ARPG genre can achieve. The game offers an enthralling time-travel narrative mixed with deep, satisfying gameplay mechanics. However, my experience was slightly dampened by persistent server and login issues.
What I Loved:
Innovative Skill System: The skill system in ""Last Epoch"" is a breath of fresh air. It allows for deep customization and encourages experimentation, which kept me engaged for hours on end.
Rich Time-Travel Story: The narrative is compelling, weaving a tale across different eras. This not only adds depth to the story but also variety to the environments and enemies.
Engaging Combat: Combat in ""Last Epoch"" is both challenging and rewarding. The variety of skills and classes allows for numerous playstyles, catering to different types of players.
Regular Updates and Developer Interaction: The developers are committed to improving the game, regularly releasing updates and engaging with the community, which is always a positive sign.",1708730492,1708730492,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can't recommend the game enough! Strikes a very good balance between complexity and ease of access. It has one of the best crafting systems in ARPGs, a built in loot filter that's easy to customize, very interesting skill/character progression system and alot more!

The launch was really rocky so far but the communication about whats causing the problems and what is being done was Very good with hourly updates and as of right now (24.02. 00:16 EU) The biggest connection issues have been fixed and the game is very much playable online.
And aside from that the game was playable even during the messy launch because it provides an offline mode. Something that SHOULD be standard but sadly isn't. This game has it tho and it works as expected...offline :) But that's not all, it even has options for offline mode. You can choose to either play your offline characters but still be able to chat with people which is pretty neat or you can start the game completely 100% offline.

I think the main appeal of this game is that the sheer amount of viable builds are massive.  There's no need to look up a guide; you can make pretty much anything work.  Pick skills you love and go.  The ability to respec pretty much anything (besides your class specialization) makes experimenting fun and easy.  Well worth the money as is, and future content might bring this to the head of the pack.

[u]Common Questions :[/u]
[b]Is this better than a better game than POE? [/b]
Not yet.  I think the core skill system, itemization, and passive trees are more focused and feel meaningful in relation.  Both games have boring campaigns.  POE's end game is more interesting and robust.  I think Last Epoch is more fun, but it still lacks the content to continue playing on a singular character.  That will likely change in the future.

[b]Is this game better than Diablo 4?   [/b]
Yes.  If all you want is a decent campaign, Diablo 4 is your go to.  Last Epoch exceeds it every other way.",1708730330,1708730330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Eleventh Hour Games has ended up going above and beyond with addressing server related issues that caused problems for many players during the launch of Last Epoch.

I have never seen a team communicate as clearly and act as quickly as Eleventh Hour Games has. The only game that comes close in my experience is the Path of Exile team.

With that said, Last Epoch has released a great game with 1.0, providing amazing graphical and animation updates. It has shocked me with how many new enemy models have been added to the game and the visual impact they provide.

I will update the review again once I have time, but I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games, not just ARPG fans!

Thank you Eleventh Hour Games for your amazing response to launch issues. I look forward to the great content you are sure to bring in the future as well!


Launch Review:

I really looked forward to the 1.0 launch after enjoying experimenting with a variety of builds during the beta period.

I'm extremely disappointed that 1.0 has resulted in an utterly broken gameplay experience where I am in a revolving door of connecting and disconnecting when entering the game and transitioning between zones.

When I'm lucky I'm able to clear one or two zones, but then I hit endless loading/getting stuck on transition to the next zones.

It's an extremely disappointing experience as I know the core game is pretty great.

I've been around for quite a few online game releases and I think this may be the worst I have experienced to date, and I honestly say this without any exaggeration as someone who really likes this game.

I hope they resolve their technical difficulties.",1708615480,1708729772,True,0,0,0.502157807350158691,0,True,False,False

This happens with the Hungering Souls and Bone Golem passive tree unlocks for Acolyte class. There's now no need to do any strategy besides spamming hungering souls while the golem automatically mops up along with the four skeletons. 

It's not as broken as D4 was near release where people were showing broken lightning+werewolf builds that were doing godlike damage.

That said, the game is great otherwise. But boring a game is a boring game. It's as if the devs decided to throw as much 'cool combat stuff' as possible into LE without consideration for overall experience or walk the tightrope of too easy/boring vs too challenging/frustrating gameplay. Fun gameplay isn't merely a consideration of hard or easy it is, but here is a case where gameplay is too easy, too early IMO.

Keep in mind this is my impression only four hours into the game and the difficulty pendulum may swing back farther into the game.  

I can hear someone say 'yeah but wait until 100 hours in where the game gets fun again!'  Well that's absurd to play a boring game for 100 hours (FFXIV) to get to the fun part. 

Another issue with nearly all games like this is that the unlocks have no connection to the story or player actions. They just appear on the passive unlock tree from thin air. There's no sense of player connection to aquiring them. The unlocks weren't a quest objective, for example. The player and even NPC's make no mention of the appearance of huge a bone golem in combat, like 'hey wtf is that thing!' Must be so normal thing in this universe to have a huge golem appear that its not even worth mentioning. For us it's the same as seeing a Walmart or a gas station. 

Also the game is moderately woke. Gender AND race locked classes. Because there were black armour-clad medeival warriors (sentinal class)? No there weren't. Real history is raycisss....  It's an agenda, a politcally charged agenda whos objectives will not favor many.

I remember Diablo 4 having the same problem. Those will be fixed. The core gameplay however, is far better than Diablo 4. The skill/passive trees alone are waaay better than what Diablo 4 had to offer. There also isn't scaling, so combat feels much more fun and rewarding. I haven't gotten to the end game yet since I only have a few hours, but from what I see is available there is at least something to grind towards unlike Diablo 4, which is also riddled with so much MTX it's surprising people still play it. Game also looks gorgeous.

Especially after having spent hundreds of hours in Path of Exile, Grim Dawn and Diablo. Rest assured, Last Epoch blends well with the other juggernauts in this genre. The game does a good job at offering familiar game mechanics (looting, crafting, class passives, skill trees, campaign, end game) and adding some new twists to them (lootable gear stats, skill customization, parallel worlds).

I have only played about 16 hours of the campaign. So far, the difficulty level is just about right. As long as you invest in your gear, you will be blasting through the maps on any character with any build. Very satisfying.

The graphics and sound effects of Last Epoch are great. Highly detailed, quickly changing environments and a fairly wide variety of crazy-looking monsters show the dedication of the art team. Voice dialogue, creaking boards and gurgling monsters are all well done.

Last Epoch is still riddled with minor bugs, like quests not triggering properly or missing map icons, but the devs are actively working on those. Nothing game-breaking here.

A few things that I dislike are:
- Monsters (even bosses) respawning after taking a portal to town and back
- Lots of (lengthy) dead ends, probably serving as stitching points for map randomization
- Quest markers telling you where to go the second you enter a map
- Following an online point-by-point build guide can be challenging due to the complexity of the multiple skill and passive trees

Tho neither to say at the time of my review the game needs a lot of work.

- Information is often badly/confusing displayed or simply not shown at all, which makes deciding on how to progress ones character quite hard. The biggest example here would be what types of damage your skill actually does and on a skill by skill bases. Having things such as increase crit for x skill, and then not even seeing much much crit or fire damage you do for that specific skill, doesn't convey much of how much dmg the skill actually deals and how to properly scale it.
- The fact that if you want to respec skills require to relevel them is off putting to say the least. It makes it quite hard to change skill mid play though and if you build yourself into a corner its very easy to just brick your character entirely. Even in PoE you have more ways to fix a build and change a skill mid way if the one you choose isnt good for your character.
- Zones are as cool as they look often quite boring corridors, no open fields in contrast to the narrow passages of a dungeon. It has a lot of different areas, yet a lot of them feel very much the same.
- Leveling defence adjustments feel quite lacking, if you hit a wall and realise that lighting damage kills you quickly, there isnt a good way to fix it in a simple way like getting an aura or crafting a resistance. Often even simple adjustments need a lot of swapping around gear and/or sacrificing a lot of damage (having played bladedancer)

Might try another character to test the waters more. I believe the game is a fun game overall, yet not a simple quick fun like D3 nor a more individualised experience like PoE. (1000% better than D4)

--- Initial Review ---

Game version at review time: 0.8.4h

[b]IN SHORT:[/b]
 - WAIT FOR 1.0 RELEASE: Nice novelty title in ARPG market but leaning too much on the GaaS side for my taste, for now I'd hold off and wait to see how it will turn out at launch

[b]IN DETAIL[/b]:

- Update 2022, publisher has got staked by Tencent (https://web.archive.org/web/20220314210813/https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/eleventh-hour-games-new-partnership/48083)

- No offline game mode, designed entirely to be a live service ... yes with a game shop, dev claiming to plan selling only cosmetics

- Not possible to pause the game! (regardless multi player is still not implemented)

- Skills customization is nice, but not really revolutionary. In comparrison to PoE each skill has its own skill-tree, so it is at least less convoluted to build a character, skills customization is more comparmentalized but the tree even if should only hold the ""active"" customization is still marred by borring flat % bonuses sometimes even noticiable and eating up many of the very few points avilable for the skill customization, while most of the the more relevant game mechanics mutating skill nodes are some kind of template available also in every other skill tree (e.g. change damage from X to Y).

  Only 5 skills can be specialized at the same time, changing them will reset their specialization level (later on respeccing).

  You can play out the build system on the web, look out for ""last epoch tools planner""

- Respeccing Skills is a punitive mechanic, no fun in experimenting, it forces you to de-level the modified skill and to re-earn such respecced skill levels or an entirely new skill from a minimum level depending on your character level, each skill level taking exponentially more exp, an index off scarce respect for the player time, like any GaaS

- You can only have 4 skills in your action bar, plus one for the default attack. There is only one action bar, it can't be swapped, same as for the weapon

- There is a in-game customizable loot-filter, this is quite good, it still needs some refining but a real appreciated feature

- Graphics are good, not incredible but updated to current standards, yet very poorly optimized, the game runs on Unity, and as for now it chockes CPU and GPU cycles... even when in background and supposedly with its own frames per second limitator active

- Musics and sounds are rather good, a  quality point

- No randomly generated maps, endgame is replaying the same maps with increasing malus mutations

- (speculation) I'm afraid because of the above it might sells also convenience items in the shop, e.g. respec without the need to re-level the skills.. they say only cosmetics, like anyone had done before their game launched

- Modifying the save game file is against the ToS (yes even during Early Access), so probably even no modding too, ""because season and leaderboards""... honestly who cares? I don't.

- EDIT: forgot to mention that characters will be wiped at launch, always beacuse seasons/leaderboards, so at the moment it feels to play a paid beta

So a well made game for sure, there is quality in these devs work, but as for EA no thanks, Grim Dawn is still better for now and especially for my taste. Last Epoch might instead entice better to the D3 and PoE crowds burn out on those game and seeking an updated  novlety. I'll be sure to check back at 1.0.",1642506009,1708721583,False,6,0,0.509517014026641846,0,True,False,True

- Servers have made ladder unplayable on cycle one. Still a good game but if you want to compete on ladder. I can't recommend this game. I would say wait a week or wait for next cycle. If you are happy to play offline this works mostly and is an enjoyable experience. 





Okay, the game is about to release and how have things shaped up. Fairly strait forward micro transactions. Cosmetic and so on. No stash tabs in store. As my grandmother use to say, I find it very reasonable.

Have they sorted all the bugs, well largely yes but and here is the big butt. Its launch day and I am sure the world as his wife will find some bugs. Its a fairly huge game and servers will be packed. I think a lot of huge streamers and their audiences will play this on the day. 

Would I recommend this, yes. The value of the up front purchase is far exceeded by the value of the game. You could charge 35 to 40 GBP and this would be about on the money for its value. Solid end game, game play and solid story. 

I wish I could give this game a higher mark than 7.9/10 but my scoring system does not allow for it. Any game I play immediately loses 5 marks out of 10 for having a cash shop. Mostly because any cash shop is a detriment to the player base and this game has a reasonable cash shop. Plus on its own its easily a 8.5 out of 10. Losing marks for relatively minor things like optimisation, bugs and server instabilities. All within variance for the launch of a game. Things I don't grade on, graphics. Largely because its not an objective way to grade a game. Graphical errors, poor choices like overly cluttered screens, bad choices like green on green, stuff that impacts game play, yes. Keep in mind that for me there is no such thing as a perfect game. In my current scoring system. No game will ever get awarded a 100%. There is always room to improve. 

As this is an updated review, my first impressions below.

""Great game, a lot of rough edges but its still in beta. They are pretty much having the community beta test it to save some dosh. It started as a passion project. So understandable. Ultimately it all depends on what the cash shop is like. Keep in mind that the cash shop will change my review completely. If it launches like wow token, diablo immoral and so on. Its a risk to buy the game without knowing. However its a tentative recommendation from me.""",1679085388,1708721544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This isn't a ""we're so popular"" problem, this is a ""our multiplayer is fundamentally broken"" problem.

I have yet to play. I've been in contact with Last Epoch support, who eventually told me they'll try to fix Last Epoch later (after sending them all of the requested information twice), and Steam has denied my refund because I didn't just bounce out immediately when it failed to function.

I tried all of the troubleshooting. Don't make my mistake. In the future, if a title fails to work immediately, refund it and force the developers to either fix it or deal with the kickback.

Avoid Last Epoch, as it doesn't work. Making discussion threads in Steam has been met with many other players, also unable to make this game work at all as advertised. There are no fixes. If this title works for you, you're apparently lucky — go purchase a lottery ticket.

With the wide number of ARPGs that actually function, purchasing Last Epoch is a horrible idea. At this point, it doesn't even matter if the game is amazing — I haven't been able to play it once since I purchased it for $35 more than a month ago. Path of Exile is completely free to play, with some optional MTXs for cosmetics and organization, by veterans of the genre.",1682354579,1708721393,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

My first impression of the game back then was that it felt unfinished. The combat felt bad and loading times, when going from one zone to another, made the game unenjoyable for me. I did not think much of it back then because the game was still in early access.

Now the game is out of early access and I can therefore no longer tolerate the same kinds of bugs and lag of polish. The game is sold as a finished game and should therefore be judged as a finished game, and my judgement is that the game should not have left early access just yet, it is still buggy, janky and incomplete.

After launch I played for about 1 hour.

In that hour I experienced the following;
     - loading times between zones has increased.
     - Game crashed one time.
     - Fps dropped to somewhere between 1 and 5. I had to crash the game to restore the framerate.

Some might excuse my complaints by saying its all because of the new launch and all the new players putting pressure on the servers. I would agree with that to some extend, but at the same time I would have to say that my experience before and after launch was not that different, it was just worse after launch.

Maybe the game will get more stable over time, who knows? I guess only time will tell.

Edit:

So I decided to play the game in ""offline"" mode, which isnt actually offline. You cant play the game in offline mode without having the pc connected to the internet, and you can chat with other players while playing, so I have no clue as to why it is called offline mode?!

Anyway, I had some fun, played for a few hours on a hardcore character until I ran into the same bug I mentioned earlier. The FPS went down to almost 0 until the game actually froze. Of course this happened while fighting one of those whizard mini bosses, so I shut down my pc hoping I would not lose my character. When I booted up the game one more time I found my character still in good shape, but I can not log into that character, I just get a weird animation and then nothing happens.

This game surely wasnt ready for release, I suggest that anyone considering buying this game should wait and see what ends up happening. Im not too optimistic since this doesnt seem to be anything related to servers being stressed by a high number of players, but instead its the damn game that is broken. 

Edit:

So I waited a while and wanted to see if I would be able to continue playing on my level 30 hardcore character. I could not because it is no longer there, its just gone. POOF!

Ok, well that sucks, but I got over it and made a new character, but now the game is constantly crashing.
