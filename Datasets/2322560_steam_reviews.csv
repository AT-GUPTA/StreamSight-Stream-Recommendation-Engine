Who ever was the camera man did a wonderfully GREAT JOB!  I cannot emphasize this more.  A really really great job!  All the woman that play in this game have been filmed in a way that make their beauty...transcend the screen.  You will be moved by each and everyone of them.  From the girl next door feeling to the big sister type, all of them will be feel as if it was real mostly because of the simple but effective way this was filmed.

Second, each and every woman in this fmv game are gorgeous, not only because they are all beautiful, but also because each and every one of them knows their role and incarnate it VERY WELL.  These girls are actrices and they play very well.  The big sister type will give you vibes of characters like Mitsuru Senpai (persona 3), while others will give you feelings of Yukari (persona 3) if you get my reference.

Where the game get a little fuzy is where the protagonist fit in it.  You will often feel that your character have limited choice in what to do or say and with FMVs gaming, that is to be understood.  Sometimes, often actually, you would have like to be able to do a different choice.  But, in order to serve the story, there was no other choice i suspect...  but don't think this is a negative for the game.  In fact, you will realize soon enough, that when your choices are limited, it is often because the story must make you meet another girl to extend the story.  Also, very often, your choice will be to add a funny, goofy element.  So it is humorous or provoking 75% of the time...which is very nice.

I have not yet finish the game, so i will refrain from giving it a final score but so far, i will say it is one of the best i have played.  8/10 for me so far.  Funny in many places, Emotional involving, Well filmed (this guy deserve a price i think), beautiful set up, very good actrices, very entertaining.

Bought the game, cause the idea was great. Turning the video footage into an interactive visual novel game is the next level of gaming. All the actresses played great job in their roles, all the emotions were captivated well. It's like watching K-Drama, but you choose your liking, which kept me really engaged throughout the game. Also there is no NSFW scenes in the game, so it's very cutesy.

Adding on, each love interests have their unique personality and we don't have to be ""truthful"" all the time. Sometimes, you just have to read the character's mind and pick the choice out of your gut. That's my favorite part about this game. 

* Some frustrating parts:
- 1. Ch.3 is annoying, you have to be a ""playboy"" and satisfy multiple love interests to move onto the next stage, 1 love interest isn't enough to get you to the next stage, which is annoying, you have to go back and fix your choices, and it limits the freedom in a way.
- 2. Also when you rush with ""skip"" the feature, you often encounter black screens and you have to relaunch the game. 
- 3. Some characters, I had to reference to the community guide, because they have a ""hidden"" answer to unlock the hidden route. (shrug)

Overall, I rate this game like 9.5/10. My favorite love interest was Xiao Lu, she has a pretty face and plays a adorable role of being shy and innocent. She's very common route with not much of challenge.",1708221398,1708221398,True,1,1,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

I have never been in a relationship because either (1) confessed to lady but rejected or (2) too scared to deal with rejections and resulting pain so never confessed. Such is my life. When I saw Disguised Toast play this, I thought ""Hey, maybe this game will let me catch a glimpse of a timeline when rejection and cowardice are not the main themes of my love life."" But, even after purchasing it, I hesitated to play it. I intuitively sensed that this game will make me go through a bunch of situations and a myriad emotions that I have desired to go through and feel for so long but I am not ready and too much of a coward to face.

When I finally found the courage to play it, it made me more sad than happy. I was sad because these situations felt genuine but I had enough self-awareness that they were all fictional. Fragments of the imagination meant to soothe the troubled hearts and minds of many like myself. How I wish I could be in these situations like the MC - only the romantic ones, I mean, not the shitty financial situation he is in - and to feel loved and desired. Is this a cause for hating this game, that it does not make sense that the all these women, wonderful in their own ways, are attracted to a pauper and floater like the MC? Or is the game actually fulfilling its primary function of escapism to players because it is after all, entirely a fantasy?

By God, this game is good in my eyes because of its facilitation of a brand of escapism with a setting in the real world, like the movies and dramas we watch on TV and streaming platforms. We play the protagonist, with all the world provided to us in the game a stage to write beautiful stories with the ladies. Our decisions have consequences, and we can carve exclusive paths with whichever lady we desire. The storyline, while not complex, are not a bane to the game. Rather, I argue that it reflects the mundanity of life, and that excitement and fulfillment comes with us finding something or someone to live for.

[b] DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION. DO NOT EXPECT IN-GAME EVENTS AND INCIDENTS TO APPLY IN REAL WORLD CONDITIONS. [/b]

one of the best in its genre (visual novel drama) simulating the unpredictability of looking for love based on human relations, associated events, and spontaneity in making decisions. doing the ""right thing"" does not always bring the appropriate consequence just like how one prospect partner applauds you for taking kickbacks. 

what's there to not love about this game? [spoiler] day-one bestfriend liu sticks to you like tile grout, zheng ziyan drinks and parties with you outside or at home, xiao lu prepares you food, shen huixin treats you like her dog (she can strap that bell all day long), lin yueqin existing, zhong zhen offers you a flat for free, and li yunsi's eternal patience. there are also funny interactions with the supporting characters making it very enjoyable treading different paths in each chapter. i also have to add that gu yi is the worst ""master masseur"" in his country.[/spoiler] 

donated all my bears to lin yueqin as [spoiler]✨child support✨[/spoiler]. although zheng ziyan  is best girl in my opinion, she's already top 1 in the leaderboards as of this writing so it's still a win. this review wont justify the excitement and surprises this game brings. play the game :D",1706148157,1706155718,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game itself is fun though and I think it provides good value for $10.00. 

What attracted me most about the game, and what I like most about it is that it features live actors/actresses, I think this adds a nice touch of realism. The acting quality in the game varies a bit, but is pretty good throughout, I also thought the devs did a good job at making the romance characters feel distinct. 

I experienced a few minor bugs, one where initially the game wouldn't start, which seemed to be an issue with steam's cloud server, but restarting steam fixed that. Other minor bugs included black screens/crashing, but exiting and relaunching the game fixed those issues. 

The English translations are good, but it's sub not dub, so have that expectation going in. The game suffers a bit as all dating sims do in that the love interests' attraction to the protagonist are generally shallow and the protagonist himself is milquetoast. If I were looking for a realist take-away from this game, it'd be 'don't date a broke dude.'",1705523643,1705524132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a girl, I find this game very unrealistic. Characters are stereotypical and superficial. Among all the characters, Shen Huixin is annoying and ridiculous, in real life, if a girl ask others to remove makeup as a challenge to prove something, I will consider she as a self-centered and crazy girl, nothing lovely about this girl. Li Yunsi's face becomes stiff each time anyone said or done anything that not 100 percent identical to her expectation, deeply unpleasant. Xiao Lu seems cute at first, but later on a little bit boring. Zheng Ziyan is close to a normal person in my opinion, but that does not make her more attractive. I have not reached the part that Lin Yueqin or Zhong Zhen appear, but I doubt any of them have a more interesting personality.
In real life, girl will not accept to share an apartment with someone they have bad impression. They also do not invite a barely known guy to stay at their home, or compete with each other like all the wives of Wei Xiaobao in The Deer and the Cauldron. Play this game for fun, just do not believe in reality girls will behave like this.

The two main gripes I have with this game are: 

a) Zhong Zhen being shoe horned in at a time where I feel it would have been better to develope MCs character or try to mend our relationship with the others.

b) Li Yunsi getting absolutely sidelined, one of two characters who we are introduced to at the beginning, who we've being getting connected to through the whole story, and we just lose her? What makes it even worse is that the plot makes us choose to leave her, her only ""ending"" is us connecting as online friends, and in the ending where everyone turns into our friend, she's not even there. I really do not understand why they had to do this character like that.

Gu Yi is one hell of a lucky guy, Every girl wants to end up with him and wants him living with them. At this point he needs an option to choose them all haha. Honestly though just give me an option to propose to the one I like so I can stop entertaining all the others.

EDIT 1: As you can see by my current playtime I am enjoying the game a lot! Busy trying to 100% it right now and just wish I could meet some of these girls irl lol.",1703429835,1704584956,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not that, it's actually ""serious"" even though it has its funny moments.
But even with that, this entertained us nicely for the hours it took to complete a full run through it and some extra endings.

There isn't much to say about the game, it's a ""dating sim"" with a romcom plot with a beginning and an end. You play as Gu Yi, a guy that is broke and in deep debt. Even then, you meet six girls who for some reason are really glad to lend you money, rent, houses, rooms, jobs, lives and in the end even their love.
The acting is not that great and the game feels really cheap despite some cool shots. 

Even then, I recommend this wholeheartedly.
My friends and I actually had tons of fun and were engaged in the story. We each had our favourite girl but since I was the one playing I went the Xiao Lu route because she is the best and sweetest girl of them all, with Zheng Ziyan a close second.
This game while far from being the best out there is a really cute and sweet read/watch and if you like this kind of games I'm sure you'll love it.

One thing I really want to stress out is to be careful to play this if you suffer from depression/loneliness and are in a bad spot overall. While it may relieve you a bit with filling that gap with 6 virtual girls showing you love in sincere forms, you may end up taking it badly, thinking ""I'll never have this irl"" and it may worsen your situation. If you think I'm bullshitting you, you can check Steam forums and reviews to see how, among many meme ones, there's actually some people sharing how this game affected them.
I'll admit that I also felt a bit of sadness after reflecting on it since I'm not in the best spot myself, but luckily playing it with friends made me associate mostly funny thoughts to the events of the game.

This is all ll I had to say about the game. I bought it for the memes but I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.

Simple and cute point and click story game with many possible story lines. Some minor issues with freezing and getting stuck on a black screen after some cutscenes, but only happened a few times in the 17 hours I put into the game.

I saw this on the Steam Game Awards and ended up becoming interested after looking at other reviews and checking out the preview on this store page. I learned some Chinese in high school, even though I forgot most of it; so I thought it also be fun to jog my memory by playing this game. 
The first time I played, I went in blind and just tried to experience the story, even though it does encourage you to go back and try other options and even forces you sometimes if you don't get enough affection with the girls. But I do recommend just going in blind the first time to experience the story line you chose. There are cute, sweet, romantic, heartbreaking, and silly moments with every girl.
If you want to 100% this, there is plenty to grind for but it becomes very repetitive when grinding for 100%. I usually don't grind for getting all the achievements but all the stories ended up pulling me in so I did it anyway, and it's not too hard to do. There are some great guides out there to help you get there. I ended up beating the game (100%) in just 17 hours, with a chunk of those hours just experiencing the story my first time through.
Definitely recommend if you like romance story games. It felt like I was in a C-drama. but extra silly. And it's very PG-13.

First of all, there are a lot of bugs making the game unplayable (crashes, stocks, etc.), and you have to restart it.
Second, this may be a personal preference, but the game theme is Asian girls. If this was an American version, I would rate it with YES.
The third problem is that your game can quickly end early, and you get locked out. Not sure if that's because of my sh*t choices at some point, but you [spoiler] get robbed and beaten. You end up without the option to continue and get a girlfriend ending unless you replay the previous chapters to match everything, and this breaks the feel of being able to choose freely...

This is a Chinese Romantic Comedy with a Detroit: Become Human style narrative, BUT (and this is important) you suck. 
The main character is just the worst, during narrative sections where you have no control, he will do the dumbest possible thing every time. You can fight against that during the CYOA parts or you can lean into it. The game understands that you are the worst and has MANY endings dedicated to different versions of this theme. 
The game also likes to mess with you personally by giving and taking away the same heart within the same scene or give you a no-win scenario. Actually, there are a lot of no-win scenarios. It's a perfect recreation of dating in your 20s.

My only complaint would be the main character, Gu Yi. To me, he wasn't a great of a character. I know it's to allow people to self insert but I don't understand how girls were supposed to like him when his only redeeming trait was that he was kind.

[b]TL;DR: The game is quite entertaining, you can have fun with it even if you aren't lonely, and it's best enjoyed if not taken too seriously - think romantic comedy with a few twist endings.[/b]

I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I bought this game. I thought I would get an experience, but what I got was [i]an experience.[/i]. The main characters are all incredibly charming, and they do a great job at bringing their somewhat one-trait characters to life, in ways that made me sit here with a big goofy grin on my face the entire time. 

The supporting cast is equally amazing, being responsible for some of the funniest moments. The casting isn't always the best, with some actors clearly being more skilled than others, but it's a good mixture of professionalism and having fun with knowing how ridiculous everything is. It brings a lot of charm to the storytelling, especially when you see the occasional slip of character.

The game is not perfect, by any measure, but it manages to provide a great blend of comedy, romance, and absurdity. Who would've thought that [spoiler]I'd end up getting buried alive?[/spoiler]

It does, at times, feel a little too guided, with you not quite being able to escape certain scenes, no matter your choices, but as players we also have to understand the sheer amount of time and money that it would take to avoid that, and the creators still did a great job ensuring that your choices cause the story to branch out. The pacing could also be improved, though that would face the same issue, so we can only expect so much.

If I had to point out one thing that the game really lacks, it would be longer romantic arcs. The story is both cute and funny, but when you finally get with a girl, I personally think that the game just sort of ends a little too quickly. I would love to see some DLCs that expand upon your relationship with each girl, and I'd be more than willing to pay for each of them separately. [i]Hint, hint, intiny.[/i]

And seriously, Liu is the best part of this whole thing and absolutely steals the show with his genuine line delivery and over the top body language. The part where [spoiler]he's in the background of the ""interview"" during Zheng Ziyan's chapter even had me looking more at the actions of a mostly blurry background character than the beautiful woman sitting right in front of me.[/spoiler] If you don't bring him back for the hopefully inevitable sequel, I'll be sorely disappointed.

Finally, and this one goes out to the developers: can we please have a feature that allows us to, once we've carved our path through the game, watch the whole thing from start to finish, with scene composition based off of our choices?",1702820575,1702820575,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

However, the criticism that many raise against the game must first be acknowledged; admittedly, certain aspects of the game feel rather mechanical (the inspection of objects around a certain room which almost never yields any serious plot implications), the late introduction of characters like Zhong Zhen render the plausibility and attractiveness of any relationship prospects with the character to be dubious, as well as the way in which the game punishes loyalty to a singular crush are all rather irking. The most glaring criticism offered is undoubtedly that, the game is excessively unrealistic: Gu Yi, as a man who has nothing to offer whatsoever in either material or emotion, attains the attraction of six girls who almost all fall for him within their first encounter. I cannot help but agree with this observation. Yet, after playing through most of the possible ""happy"" endings, I must pose the question: is realism what we are really looking for in this game? I would argue, it is exactly the fantastically perfect romances that are on offer which makes forms the attraction of this game; the provision of such an oasis of delusion is what makes this game satisfying. The only dissatisfaction which occur during a play-through of the game is the dissatisfaction of choice, as each girl holds their own charm: the intensity of ZhengZiyan's emotions and the freedom she provides, the wordless care and love of Li Yusi, the persistent love of Shen Huixin which prevails even over her obedience of her father, the unquestioning sacrifice and simple and steady lifestyle which Xiao Lu offers, as well as the initiative of Lin Yueqin despite being shy in nature render a choice to be agonizing, yet no matter who you choose, the ending will be a satisfying one, but nonetheless leave you desiring even more. The escapist fantasy of the game is one that all must experience; such a fantasy makes any real life relationship to feel colorless in comparison.",1702815704,1702815704,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is probably the best £8.50 I've ever spent on a game.

First if all the girls are beyond beautiful, and highly attractive.
Which makes this game very captivating as its not like they are AI they are actual real actresses if you do the research.

Secondly the mechanics of the game is well put together. Each choice you make can have a huge effect on the time line of your story further on. There isn't just one ending either you have alteast 6 true endings with a few early endings too. Which strives you to back to the beginning again and try to achieve a different ending.

The dialogue is on point, and the English translation is perfect, it all makes sense when reading it. (My only down side here is that if your a slow reader the subtitles do not stay on the screen long enough to read them unless you pause).

Lastly, the game actually teaches you 2 very important things, 1) that it's not only about looks its about personality and giving affection. 2) it teaches you about how caught up in love you can get, to a point where you should take a step back and focus on earing money for your own stability.

There are alot of skills that can be taken from this game which can be applied when looking for a partner in the real world.

For example:  I've played this game up to chapter 5 and then got stuck.  A friend wanted to watch me play so I decided to start over.  Got through chapter 1 fine.  Chapter 2 however, I could not get any further even though I made all the same choices I made the first time I played.  I went back, chose different girls and all of their options and still could not get past chapter 2.

Not boring since the characters are the actual actresses and the interaction is much immersive than the other games similar to this. Also the mechanics of the game is not that easy to complete, It's like you have to meet the required love meter before you can proceed to the next chapter so this will make you more interested to find out the other choices since you need to go back and repeat the chapter. Also, the actors and actresses played in this game are so good that will make you wanted to continue playing the game. I also liked the way they made it look like a real dating sim, you know without those sexual stuff. Well most guys will definitely want to see it but most men would prefer it to be more wholesome as long as there is a good story and development of the characters. The only thing that I don't want that hopefully the developers will fix if they will make a sequel or dlc is the transitioning once you choose the answer. It feels off and it ruins the mood as the transition just goes by and cutting off the scene. I would prefer it to be more like a continuous scene right after you choose your desired answer. I think that would be better ( just my opinion). But overall the game is entertaining and I would say the price you pay is definitely worth it.

I'm not even finished but I can understand it - this is very interesting and enjoyable. I've played a few VNs focused on romance - usually from a Japanese perspective on how to do things -, but this one with the modern setting, live action and great acting performances together with a story that weaves around between the characters really makes it one of the best I've experienced.

Of course, it still relies a lot on genre stereotypes, but it's done tastefully, and when your supposed stereotypes are real life people right in front of you you can't just dismiss them as such - it's real women in front of you! A

Also, you get to explore so many different paths with any and all the girls, providing many different paths/stories all around. But there's so many interesting scenes playing out so interestingly and with perfect timing, I'm sold.

This game also has inspired my to get into Duolingo for Mandarin, which I always had an inkling to do after studying Japanese for like 3 years, but never quite got 'round to it. Just during gameplay experiencing the different locales it's kind of a mini virtual trip.

 After my first play-through and ending up with the girl my gut felt the most right, I was thoroughly satisfied with the journey. Also, I feel like it provides a huge incentive to try and experience the other girls' endings as well. ""love is all around"" indeed. 

I truly wonder if this is not a start of a new genre. Traditional VNs have felt to me mostly as ""this is cool, but so wordy and the translations maybe aren't up to snuff.... What if it's real live-action actors expressing themselves and you get the dialogue and the facial/body expressions just right to experience whilst you are playing?""

Virtual first person movies / TV series - this is what it feels to me and it's very enjoyable. Totally can recommend and join in the ""overwhelmingly positive"" crowd :)",1701651647,1701652941,True,1,0,0.501607716083526611,0,True,False,False

Love Is All Around is not just a game; it's an emotional odyssey that captivates players with its charm, warmth, and delightful storytelling. From the moment I embarked on this love-filled adventure, I found myself immersed in a world that seamlessly blends whimsy with profound emotions.

The visuals are a feast for the eyes, featuring a vibrant and beautifully crafted environment that mirrors the game's uplifting narrative. The story building, reminiscent of a living storybook, creates an enchanting atmosphere that pulls you into its embrace.

What truly sets Love Is All Around apart is its ability to evoke genuine emotions. The characters are well-developed, each with their unique quirks and personalities, making it easy to connect with them on a personal level. The dialogue is witty and heartfelt, contributing to a narrative that effortlessly tugs at the heartstrings.

The gameplay is both engaging and accessible, striking a perfect balance between challenge and enjoyment. Puzzles and tasks are seamlessly integrated into the storyline, ensuring that each moment spent playing contributes to the overall narrative arc. The game encourages exploration, allowing players to uncover hidden gems and intricacies that add depth to the overall experience.

The soundtrack is a standout feature, perfectly complementing the emotional highs and lows of the journey. From uplifting melodies during moments of joy to gentle tunes that accompany reflective scenes, the music enhances the emotional impact of the narrative.

Love Is All Around is more than just a game; it's a celebration of love, friendship, and the intricacies of human connections. It's a rare gem that manages to strike a balance between gameplay mechanics and heartfelt storytelling, leaving players with a warm glow that lingers long after the credits roll. If you're in search of a game that goes beyond entertainment and leaves a lasting impression, Love Is All Around is a must-play experience that reminds us all that, indeed, love is everywhere.",1701621711,1701627085,True,123,66,0.80205690860748291,8,True,False,False

Playing the game completely absorbed me into the main character's shoes. But it is a bit frustrating that the player has to play the main character who has fair for art but disappoints Yunsi, the gentle and understanding female visual artist. 
Aside from Yunsi, the other female characters will certainly enchant players. Personally, I can see a trait in every female character except Huixin that I want in an ideal girlfriend. 
The hidden ending of Yunsi makes me happy as I feel that e-pal and art should be together. I would have liked Intiny to make a follow-up after they made the male version of the female players.

The game is best enjoyed without having to look for the walk-through or guide, but I do understand if people had watched the walk-through or guide to beat the ex-husband. 

I want to thank Intiny for the game and effort they put in. In comparison to the visual novel that uses animated characters, it must have taken a lot of time to produce the game. For that reason,
I think the game will fit well with an audience who loves romance drama. This game is a romance drama that allows the choice of the main actor to be decided.",1701616323,1701616323,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Pros[/b]

1. Dirt cheap.
2. At least ten hours of gameplay with lots of variations on what you can do.
3. Very likable characters with tons of personality including some of the side characters.
4. At least from what I can tell, the team that made this seems genuinely passionate about making a good game.
5. Actually a good game.
6. Pretty SFW.

[b]Cons[/b]

1. Like most romance VNs, the male MC is kinda bland.
2. While having so much variation in scenarios is definitely great, it's also hilarious when you treat a girl like crap for ten scenes in a row but she still wants to get together with you.
3. Occasional audio quality issues mostly relating to the filming.
4. Occasional drop in quality in some videos and pictures.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Extremely good value, great plot and characters, well designed game made with love and passion. I found the Behind the Scenes section surprisingly funny and touching. Really looking forward to the next game the devs will make.",1701440383,1701440425,True,128,7,0.870821595191955566,0,True,False,False

If you enjoyed Ten Dates, I think you'll like this one. It feels very similar (even the music).

As an American, I'm not very familiar with Asian culture, and I was surprised by many of the turns the story took. There were times I thought ""Oh, wow. Now, I am truly screwed. I'll have to backtrack."" but then the story would go somewhere I didn't expect.

The only thing I didn't like is that, to progress to the next chapter, you're required to keep more than one woman happy. I wish the story was more open-ended.

The options in the story were pretty different, you could see more content.
But the issue arises when some of these options don't align and you suddenly appear where you didn't choose to be. Also despite how you treated a character, their feelings for you are still high. I think the cause of this are the expensive shots.It would've been very costly to shoot all the possible reactions of the characters.

Overall I really enjoyed it, I finished 3 of the routes in 6 hours, which for only $10 is pretty decent. The characters are all great, with one obvious best...


LIU, as with all dating sims, the kindest, most supportive and funniest character is the childhood friend! Unconditional support, he finds you housing, picks you up when you are down, jokes around and makes you laugh, he is the one and true best character.

Oh yeah I guess there are also six girls to choose from... they are all very nice, I'm guessing everyone has their faviroute, but you can't really go wrong (duh).

I guess the only downside is that there are six chapters, and to get to the next chapter you need to get a certain amount of ""affection,"" that was a bit annoying, but all the different routes are really well written and acted, so I don't mind too much. Also while there is a branching story with different paths, they sort of all lead to the same place, the only difference is how much affection you will get from one route.
I would of liked there to be more branching story, and more options, but for a dating sim, it had plenty enough.

Last thoughts before I go back to get the other endings; some moments are really cringe, and a few times I found the options available where all really cringe, unrealistic or bad, but I guess sometimes life just sets you up that way. All the acting was great, not like I could easily tell bad from good acting, but I never thought ""well that was poorly acted,""
Same with the writing, I don't speak a word of Chinese, but the English subtitles seemed pretty up to scratch. 

Overall, fun, and oh god I'm going to be alone forever pls help m-",1700830212,1700830212,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The actresses playing the main characters are awesome. The actor playing your buddy Liu is excellent as the comedic sidekick. The support actors are charming and even the crew get involved in the scenes. The production, camerawork, locales, and direction are top-notch. The behind-the-scenes and interviews are a nice touch. I wish the actor who played Liu was included in the interviews though. The UI, unfortunately, is a weak point and some features were not discovered until hours later or after completing the game. For instance, I didn't know you could click the golden bears. The forced replay to reach a goal on the relationship meter could have been removed from the game. Having to choose different paths to meet a specific goal on the meter wasn't needed and broke the narrative that I was creating as the player. I understand why this was done (addressed in the spoiler below), but the forced replay was unnecessary since players who enjoy the game will play it multiple times. Spoiler-ish improvements: [spoiler] There needs to be an ending scene if you don't get Yunsi and you don't have enough interest with the other 5 girls. I got stuck staring at 5 uninterested ladies with no way to continue or have closure in one play-through. Also, the actress who played Haohao's teacher should get more screen time in future games. It is unfortunate her time was brief.  [/spoiler]

The only minus points is the story line which is far from reality as in this game it's so easy to be in relationship with girls.

However after complete almost of it, there are many valuable things I learned from playing this game :

[olist]
[*] Each choice in this life is matters so it's must be taken carefully as each decision will have it's consequences.
[*] There are indeed many personality of people and through playing this game I learned how each people is unique with their character.
[/olist]

There are also many positive things about this game :

[olist]
[*] The characters are quite varied and that's make the game not boring to play
[*] Although the plot story is a bit unrealistic, the story line it's interesting as you can't predict what will be happen in each chapter. Like one of the actress said it's like mystery box.
[*] All the endings depicts everything including how all the characters becomes friends although the Secret Girl sadly not included in those scenes.
[*] The secret ending is a bit creative and the mechanic of the game that requires a bit of thinking and adjusting each chapters to reach the end is fascinating as well.

[/olist]

I give appreciation to all the actress that acted they role very well through this whole story plot. 

I would like to recommend this game because it's worth the price. 

You can learn about life, how someone choice will decide how he will become, how to deal which each person with different character. 
You need to find choices you needed to fully unlock everything in one run which is kinda challenging for me.

The MC  is not the brightest bulb and the player's task is to make the right decisions for him, so that he finds a happy end.

It's not a realistic dating sim and there is no content that's only suitable for adults.

Of course, the 6 main women are too cute, pretty and helpful to be true, but I love them all.
They are the stars of this interactive movie, not the movie's story.
The movie is divided into 6 chapters, nearly all are very good. Only chapter 5 can't quite keep up.
In order to see the next chapter, you have to reach a certain amount of positive reactions in the previous chapter. 
You can't save, but there is a very good diagram where you can enter at any known decision. It also shows you where there are still unseen scenes.

This is an interactive storytelling game to simulate a love lesson in a drama with multiple endings, the sensitive scene you see in the game is the same as you could see in Chinese drama. Don't worry if you are worried and don't be disappointed as it is more interesting than that.

Recommend everyone to play this game until 100% completion or at less reach the DESTINY ending. This game/drama does not really end if it does not reach the Destiny ending. You don't get to see the whole story of this game if you did not reach the Destiny ending and just feel disappointed with the story. If you reach the Destiny ending then you will give this game a very high score else you just have very little experience with this game. I give this game a 80/100 score.

[list]
[*]Story : almost have / a complete of everything about love
[*]Interesting : yes, Zheng Ziyan make it so interesting
[*]Humour :  yes, Liu does make some humour and your options make much more humour
[*]Character : very good, each girl have their own unique and interesting
[*]Puzzle : easy and hard but interesting
[*]Knowledge Gain : there is a lot of how to succeed in love if you realize and absorb it
[*]Soundtrack : I finished the game but come back just to listen to the music/sound
[/list]

A bit of story spoiling here, if you haven't played this game may skip this first, if you played this game until chapter 6 then continue.
[spoiler]At the beginning most everyone thought and began playing this game based on your (the player) interest and it is a story of you (the player) made. At chapter 6 timelines have many more things that you can't choose for what you want and get disappointed about the story. For example, if you are not interested in Li Yunsi, you don't want Gu Yi to go to see Li Yunsi have a new boyfriend and get so upset. If you don't go this path, then the path you can go is ending alone or just be friends with all the 5 girls. But until you find the ending of DESTINY then you realize, you are actually playing on Gu Yi timeline (at chapter 6), this is not the timeline you made, this is Gu Yi love story. Chapter 6 is correct, of course Gu Yi is so upset when Li Yunsi gets married to another guy. And don't be disappointed if you like Li Yunsi, the Destiny ending will surprise you.[/spoiler]

This game has a good love story and teaches us some lessons about love and life.

[h3]Compare this game with in real life :[/h3]
In real life you can't go back to the timeline and redo the mistake and you may have a lot of opportunities, just the wrong action you did caused you to lose it before you get it. If you play this game without going back to the timeline to redo something, you may found not enough favorability. There are also no future timeline paths of yours in real life, what you do now / next may open an opportunity / a new path in your life. In real life it could be the same with this game but not so many girls come at the same time unless you intend to get many girls. Each of your actions could open opportunities to yourself, you could learn this from Zheng Ziyan in the game, in chapter 1 she already opens an opportunity for herself with intent or she really just needs someone to have dinner and drink with her or could be both purpose. People who are very proactive get to know more people than people who are passive. When you know someone and do some activities with them, your relationship with them becomes better and this is like what is in game, but the game just makes it more interesting with everything happen at the same time and you may not able to do everything correct like in the game that you can redo.

[h3]Here is what you may have learned in this love lesson game :[/h3]
1) Fate may or may not come to you, it may only come to you once or twice, the rest is your actions (you know you need it and you have to get it), if you missed it then sorry you had failed it. (if [spoiler]Gu Yi didn't go to meet Li Yunsi it's over[/spoiler])

2) Luckily you can redo every mistake you made in the game, but in real life you can't, you have to carefully think and do the right actions. (Zhong Zhen teach you this in the game)

3) Do something better than do nothing, your action may change something or trigger another thing to happen or let you get more information. (Zheng Ziyan teach you this in the game by her actions and if it fail, well it's just play for fun)

4) If you don't do anything just wait, other people are doing something with him/her. You are in a losing and disappointed position. (how Li Yunsi feels when she just waits)

5) Keep scoring until you succeed. If you keep scoring max favorability on a girl, there are 3 girls in the game who have a quick direct happy ending with you and everything becomes simple. In real life, if the girl is not certain you are the right one then she will not easily accept you.

6) Don't hurt someone too much. There are 4 girls in the game who have a bad ending with you (if favorability is near 0). You know this in real life, if you hurt someone who likes you so much you better be careful.

7) Don't be so surprised or feel so unrealistic in the game where most of the girls are chasing you so hard. This actually is a lesson to you, you have to do this if you want to succeed or regret later when someone did it. The girls in the game think in this way, only one of them could succeed and the rest fail.

8) Opportunity, you should not and do not need to wait for opportunity to come to you. You can make an opportunity for yourself. Learn it from Zheng Ziyan in the game, in chapter 1 she already makes an opportunity for herself and many more opportunities she did later.

9) When you are in a relationship you should have a thousand patience and should not get angry. In the Personal Endings, no matter how many times you repeat the ending mini game, the girl will not get angry, it is countless repeats.

10) Horoscope, you can see the 6 girls' horoscopes (Sun sign) in their profile. These help you understand them better, same for in real life, you could understand someone better by their horoscope. Here I will give you much more detail about horoscopes. The Sun (most important) sign is easy to know by the birthday date, other signs are much harder to calculate, but the 1st House (2nd important) sign usually can be guessed by a person's behavior and lifestyle, there are many more other signs that do play an important role.

[list]
[*]Sun (life objective, inner self, CEO)
[*]1st House (action, behavior, outer self, COO)
[*]Others signs (the 9 Planets and 2nd to 12th Houses sign) - here are multiple horoscope signs represent different aspect, we may found a few signs play important role

You can play this game by trying everything and learn all the consequences/lessons and then get the 100% completion. Then go to make a happy ending story for Gu Yi or make your own story by focusing on a girl with max favorability in every chapter (there are 3 girls in the game that have a quick direct happy ending that you can make your own timeline without going through Gu Yi timeline at chapter 6).

The only other thing that I played which was remotely close to this was Doki Doki literature club, but I enjoyed 'Love Is All Around' way more. 

The stories interconnect well, the character development is written into the story really well and the character portrayal is done really well by the actresses. Most of the choices seem grounded for the context you make them in and when there is an element that may be a bit out there, it isn't too jarring but rather quite enjoyable. I was invested in all the characters when following their story arc to the end. 

The achievements were also doable without too much of a grind. 

I rate it a 9.4/10 the 0.6 would be for some quality of life additions they could include like allowing you to drag the story line across the chapter through your chosen path, instead of resetting it by going back into the videos. 
Another thing would be using a more discernible indicator to display affection gained or lost when making a choice instead of the heart indicator getting bigger or smaller which can easily be missed when you're focusing on the story. 

Or [spoiler] In the end game, letting you skip the destiny ending after you have seen it for the first time when unlocked in the other ending scenarios. [/spoiler]

I rarely buy games, but I was satisfied with my purchase and if they ever release another one, I will most likely pick it up. 

I'm glad the developers included a behind the scenes section, which will be interesting to watch after finishing the game.

Anyways here are my thoughts on the game subjectively as there are good things and bad things from my perspective : 
Good things : 
- The actors are all beautiful (yes yes, im shallow lol)
- The story easy to read and if we forget the slight lag from time to time, flows quite smoothly.
- The comedy isn't bad ( Not laughing your ass off good but not bad that you turn your head and scoff either)
- The music/sound effect is good. Simple and nice so it doesn't overlap on the visuals (quite like some series i've watched i have to say)
The Bad :
- The UI is slow....Sometimes it laggs during transition of each scene which might disrupt the flow of the story and the feeling that scene wants to convey.
- There were some inconsistency in the story ive noticed (for example even if you choose to go and become a roommate with other girls somehow your suitcase is still at Yunsi's and after the hospital scene you comeback to that house rather where you were staying)

All in all this is a good game if you want some light-hearted easy to play game with romance element and beautiful characters, but if you're looking for a game that has a huge world and character building then you might be disappointed. 

I enjoyed it for what it is and you might as well if you give it a chance.

Hope the next game from this developer rectifies this issue and become even better.",1700225000,1700225000,True,2,0,0.525268018245697021,0,True,False,False

2322560,149839151,76561198033321466,0,14,380,1,190,1708131686,"这个游戏刚听闻时候，看到过于“接地气”的标题（英文名LOVE IS ALL AROUND好很多）和介绍标签，一开始是拒绝的。然而随着一些了解，和自己的游玩后，觉得这个游戏有不少可圈可点之处，乃至满足了自己的一些“梦”，也来说说感想。

这个游戏的确篇幅不长，做工也不算很精致，特别每个转场停顿看着有些生硬。不过在于几个女演员的挑选上下了功夫，她们不算倾国倾城，不过都很符合角色的定位，演技台词也都可以。

很多人说这个游戏科幻，我觉得其实也不是都如此。不过我也理解了为何会被说成科幻，乃至作为卖点。

主角没有露脸，但是就游戏里面的各种信息来看，这个角色并不是那么的一无是处。他表面欠债几百万，钱都还不起。但是很多对话看得出，他家里家境不差。有艺术天赋，学过正规的画画。拳击可以打败林乐清的前夫，也看得出身材够壮有一定的锻炼。还有老六那句“你不比以往”自己说的“以前没把钱当钱”都可以看出他家境不差。是一时做生意失败，不想靠别人帮忙。债主还是青梅竹马小女友的老爹，并没有逼着他支付，只是不希望女儿和他好而已。

同时主角在大部分的分支里也很热心乐于助人，也很有自尊心。也就是长相有人吐槽过，但主要是那个前夫，还有沈彗星的闺蜜，可能他只是看着不够威猛。

这样的男生在有详细剧情描写的情况下，和剧中任何一个女角色发生感情，都是合乎情理的。只是6个人，彼此还不怎么吃醋闹，才显得科幻。特别是开头和郑梓妍的相遇的确比较扯，极大程度放大了这种印象。说科幻的，不少都拿这段来举例。

郑梓妍作为女一号，就是典型爱情故事里那种cipher式的天降女主。身份神秘，顾虑少极其看重爱情，在男主角低落的时候出现带来无尽光明。紫霞那么被人喜欢也因为她是这种类型。但是这个开头实在处理的不好，就因为穿件衣服就去喝酒了，如果改成主角低落时在酒吧里为她出头，这样会合理的多。虽然这就和后面林乐清重了。其实之后对她也做了一些诠释，她过去的恋爱结果都不好，但是看着还是太二次元化太虚幻了。这个角色本身塑造不错，很讨人喜欢，但是也同时放大了科幻感，特别和其他人对比。

其他几个女角色就要更现实不少，比如肖鹿作为来社会打拼的单纯少女，能受到哥哥那样的关怀动心是合理的，虽然进展还是略快。沈彗星和男主是青梅竹马却打不破那一层，所以把男主落魄看成自己成功的机会。林乐清虽然条件好，但是有儿子，有纠缠不休的前夫和家庭，有个能包容他的男人不容易。

钟甄这个角色被人说太简单，我觉得更多是追求过程太快太容易了，她自身的塑造还是有点料的，比如不安全感（后面的摊牌也看得出她有要求），工作之外感到枯燥，被人追求倍增压力。现实的女霸总自然没那么简单，但是同样，女频文的男霸总，也和现实里差别很大。

这个游戏这点也做的好，它不仅是让玩家感受到被爱，也让这些女角色各自展现的脆弱和烦恼。这样既不让她们爱显得完全是无根之木，也能让主角用自己的行动和爱帮助她们，同时实现自身的成长，去承担责任和关怀他人。这其实也是对于很多玩家的心理满足。好比樱木花道对赤木晴子的追求和对篮球的爱，本质上是为了脱离原本浑浑噩噩的生活，通过打拼得到大众的认可。爱是相互的，不是单方面的索取。

其他男角色也没有都丑化，虽然追求钟甄的总裁还有林乐清的前夫不是很正面的形象，但是李云思的未婚夫就是挺好的人。老六更是铁杆好兄弟。

李云思放最后说。我之所以会买这个游戏，主要也是因为李云思。因为事先知道她是附加结局，在之前的结局选择，我是有些别扭的，因为不想渣别人，选择上是根据“最能经受打击的”那个来的。所以肖鹿这种天真小姑娘是坚决不碰的，林乐清也是有个孩子不容易，最后还是委屈一下钟甄了。虽然本身钟甄也是第二人选。

这种大姐姐本来就是我的菜，但是之前也见过很多，演员气质不错算不上倾城倾国。能让我投入有一个极其重要的原因：志趣相投。

我不是一个特别渴望爱的人，相反更希望找到一个心目中完美的女神去投入自己所有的爱，哪怕没有回报。我有很多喜欢的文艺女角色，也追过很多女明星女运动员，从她们的作品、比赛、自传都看，去读她们或者她们角色的灵魂。乃至追求过现实里的一些美女。她们的灵魂大多也是同样美丽的，不少人都有着传奇的人生。但是这么多女神里，和我有类似兴趣，喜欢我爱的那些文艺IP和体育的非常少，甚至大部分是绝缘。包括女足球员里皇马球迷也极少。虽然这不是不喜欢她们的理由，但是多少也是有些遗憾。对瑞典女足球员阿斯拉妮的崇拜，也因为她是皇马铁杆。

而李云思除了温柔大姐姐的性格之外，她毫无疑问是最懂主角的，不仅知道主角的向往，欣赏主角的天赋，默默支持希望帮他成功，不让他过分在意俗务。同时她也和主角有相同的艺术爱好，还能看到主角关注艺术背后的人文精神。这一点，其他女角色显然了解得不够深入。

而且她也展露出了相对独立的人格。她的离开，最主要并不是因为主角和其他人纠缠不清，而是主角为了俗务放弃了艺术，和她所欣赏的他越来越远。因而她也一度选择了别人。

同时只有主角自己做出努力去求爱，加上之前的网络沟通让她看到主角的追求和见识，才在最后彼此都坚持到底。据说李云思没有独立结局是因为疫情等原因，但是现有的结局也别有一番韵味。比其他的一帆风顺更美，更搭她。这种爱是我所渴求的。所以她既然做出了这样难得的放弃，自己也值得为她放弃。

从李云思的身上，我看到了大姐姐那种默默的关怀支持，更有对于主角才艺和灵魂上的理解。而且她对主角的情感，同时也是对于自己艺术梦想的爱。从她身上，我不仅看到了自己寻找千百度的“她”，也看到了那个渴望知己的“我”。因而这个角色非常的打动我，让我买下这个游戏，从中得到了很多情感上的满足，甚至甘愿许诺他人后再离开。当然，戏是戏人是人，演员自己也说和角色没有多少相似，但还是感谢她的表演，给我带来的快乐。

总体而言，这个游戏虽然有不少粗糙之处，但是的确有明显的长处。只是被很多偏见所掩盖了。包括这段时间的正面宣传，也有一些过分强调了对玩家被爱的满足，忽略了它对于女角色本身的刻画，以及对于主角自身成长都有不少可圈可点之处。写下这篇出了发表自己的感想，也希望能帮大家更好了解这个游戏的长处。",1699572439,1699572439,True,8,0,0.565085172653198242,0,True,False,False

Most dweebish story I have ever seen in my life. MC has a potato for a brain. The girls start to love you because you give them the first piece of cake or choose to move in with them rather than the other choices.

Just when you thought you were about to progress to stage II of r3t4RRRRd level storytelling, you find out you have to go back and redo all your previous choices because you didn't choose only 1 girl to SIMP for enough. Or maybe the choice you made wasn't the SIMPiest.

It made me feel fantastic when I played it the first night. It's unbelievable to experience a life filled with all kinds of beauty around you. For many men who have never tried talking to any girls, this could be the best game for them to experience life as a handsome and charming man (though the debts in the game are quite heavy).

In the game, there are six girls with different personalities, and all of them fall in love with you (of course, you need to choose the right answers to make them like you). But in reality, you can't have all of them like you; you need to make a decision. There are six good endings in this game, but to me, I like none of them. You can choose the poor but positive girl who even motivates you to compete in a money-saving competition with her. If you don't like paying and working hard, there are other girls who own their own houses and can help you pay off all the debts. One of them is the creditor and also your childhood sweetheart, she is full of enthusiasm and a bit arrogant. One is a boss who manages a company, she is very rich but busy. One is the girl who silently helps you, never throwing a temper, and provides you with practical help. One is the sexiest and the second richest girl but has a son living with her; she always needs you to understand her family, including children and elders. Finally, the most popular among players, she is the girl you met first, and the most dangerous (if you do something wrong, she may ""kill"" you). She loves to drink and party, she is independent and free-spirited. They are like mirrors reflecting reality, both real and unreal.

You can enter each girl's ending if they like you, but before the end, the girl you choose will confess her shortcomings to you and give you another chance to choose a better girl without those shortcomings. If you don't like the ending, you can stop and reconsider.

I felt very tired when I finished all the endings of the game. Although the story in the game may not be true, the art in it draws from life. The craziest thing is that real life can be even more dramatic. I felt upset when I tried to put myself in those situations. I couldn't understand why we need to abandon something to find love. I don't want to experience this feeling, even if it may never happen to me. Actually, my favorite ending is living in a rental house with my friends and trying to pay off the debts.

My sister told me that it's fine; I am still at an age where I don't want to be in a relationship. I am living alone now, feeling free and happy. Maybe I will understand love in the future, but for now, let me enjoy the night with myself.

-Nice camera work. But not montage.
-Beautiful girls. Nice actors. They are good, it's interesting to watch over them.
-Good style. The picture and sound are really pleasant. 
Cons:
-Writing. The first chapter is ok, the last looks like it was written by an intern.
-Choices. Some choices do nothing, some stupid as hell, some don't give you a clue what happens next, sometimes there is no choice where they should be.
-Romance. You can't be a nice guy no matter what. You can't completely focus on one girl. The game simply will not proceed if you do not want to be a monkey. And if you do not romance a specific girl, so... bad end.
- Request time out. The game needs constant internet connection. Any ping and you will be returned to the main menu + bugs, lags do not give points to the game.

Result: Nice to play together with a friend to kek from writing (buy on sale). In the other way it is just a waste of time and money.",1699198172,1699198172,False,3,0,0.50205761194229126,0,True,False,False

Dating sim and hentai dating sim are two completely different genres for completely different audiences - something many developers failed to understand. Imagine Netflix's ""First Love"" threw in some 'sexy moments' every episode. It would only ruin it.

In terms of gameplay, dating sim games are, to me, all about atmospheres, characters and whether the stories can touch your heart. This game excels in all of them. Couldn't care less for gameplay mechanics, still they are not as bad as some implied. The simplicity, for example, is a huge plus for me - typical Japanese dating sims always involve some serious character-nurturing aspects (e.g., raising stats by going to school/work) and very strict time management, which I always find pointless and distracting. ""Love Is All Around"", as I would put it, has only the 'sweet stuff'.

You don't have to be single or pathetic to enjoy this kind of game. Just as everyone can enjoy a good romance tv series.",1699164947,1699164947,True,109,4,0.866504132747650146,0,True,False,False

Behold, above are just a few of the bold (some say true) claims brought up when mentioning the newly released ""Love Is All Around"". Don't quote me on that, see how many people are playing and have nothing but praises to sing. Play it for yourself to find out.


[h2] The standard for dating sims [/h2]

""Love Is All Around"" is my GOTY for 2023. It has the best girls, interactions, and romantic moments of all time for a live-action FMV dating sim released in October 2023. Of course the only reason you might be considering this game is because of the girls right? Not to worry, for LIAA has got a full palette to satisfy each one of your tastes.



[h3] I will now introduce and [b] (objectively) [/b] rank each girl [/h3]

[spoiler] [b] 1. Shen Huixing [/b]
There's no doubt about it. The top place belongs to your sweet and playful, sometimes tsundere-ish, childhood friend Shen Huixin. I will not be accepting any objections and anyone who claims that first place should be anyone else should reconsider their judgement, and maybe replay the game so their eyes can be opened. This is (without a hint of hesitation) definitely the true intended ending that the developers wanted us to achieve. She is the main timeline, the true heroine, and the canon event. The fact that she is so low on the global leaderboard is probably a nexus event and should immediately be corrected. What more can you ask for? She has loved our MC, Gu Yi, for the longest time and is upfront with her feelings, unlike some characters in certain shows nowadays. It is the job and responsibility of players like us to guide Gu Yi to the decisions that favor Huixin (the correct decisions) so that the proper flow of events can happen. Try as you may to challenge this, destiny still arrives. The childhood friends always wins, it is inevitable. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] [b] 2. Zheng Ziyan [/b] 
The One Ring, the one with the Force, and the original anomaly. Zheng Ziyan was never supposed to happen. She was born out of a need to stop the overwhelming might of the Shen Huixin timeline. Fearing that the prime timeline would destroy any hope of other possible timelines existing, the devs decided to create a wildcard to prevent the monopoly of strength --- something that would balance out the powers of the universe, in the form of Zheng Ziyan. Charming and caring, equal parts flirty and cheeky, while being carefree and shy at times, Zheng Ziyan is the perfect weight in the scale of power. She gives off girl-next-door vibes, appearing mysterious and closed-off, but willing to open up if you are honest and engage with her. Stick with her through thick and thin, and you will surely be rewarded with her affection. The devs made the right move to add her in, but they might have underestimated just how effective she is at power-balancing. Topping the global leaderboards (by a huge margin), she is by far the most popular pick. Although still not the true one (as I have explained beforehand). [/spoiler]

[spoiler] [b] 3. Lin Yueqin [/b]
The dark horse of this tournament. Universe 11's Jiren, unwilling to be erased from existence and still fighting for the survival of her universe, the hidden trump card --- Lin Yueqin. A single mom who recently got divorced when she first meets Gu Yi, she reaches out to him for help in dealing with her ex-husband. Whether Gu Yi accepts or not is up to you. As the Aunt May of this Parker household, she has to prioritize her young one. However, she is well-off and only desires someone's company under a lonely roof. She holds a youthful flair and is more than willing to share her love if treated well. This is the Blue Eyes White Dragon thrown in the deck by the devs, trying to counter the damage caused in the aftermath of Shen Huixin and Zheng Ziyan's scuffle. Their hopes of restoring the universe to a single earth after a showdown between Anti-Monitor and the Justice League might not be too far-fetched, as she has proved to be a worthy opponent, claiming the runner-up spot in the tournament of power. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] [b] 4. Xiao Lu [/b]
Young kouhai with the financial situation of a bald villain trying to steal the moon, we have college student Xiao Lu. Starting off on the wrong foot, Gu Yi ends up sharing a flat with her, but they aren't exactly Mordecai and Rigby. As she is younger than Gu Yi, it is best to proceed like you are Hiccup meeting Toothless for the first time, ensuring she's comfortable before approaching. And by that I mean sincerely like a friend first, then maybe something else further down the line. Gradual trust is built, and soon you'll be ready to fly through space together smoother than WALL-E and EVE. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] [b] 5. Li Yunsi [/b]
The exhibitionist. As in art, because that's where you meet her, at an art exhibition. Ready to moisten her (with water from your fountain of knowledge) about facts like Michelangelo's love for pizza, and how Edvard Munch likes scary movies. In this story, Yunsi is like the girl you can't imagine wanting you but she somehow does. Why she would go for a man like Gu Yi is something you will need to find out yourself. But this isn't some Amy Rose and Sonic the Hedgehog situation. If you don't play your cards right, you might find yourself as Romeo in this Shakespearean play. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] [b] 6. Zhong Zhen [/b]
Boss lady who doesn't mind taking charge and pampering you. Maybe you're Markiplier looking for his Lady Dimitrescu, or you have secretly dreamt of dating your boss. Well, now you can. Honestly, I don't have much to say about her as she only appeared later. If she manages to grab your interest in that short amount of time, great. But there's a reason why she isn't higher on my list. [/spoiler]


[h3] And there you have it [/h3]

The most accurate and objectively analysed (with facts) tier list of this game's love interests. Hopefully this gets you even just a little bit interested in this game, a game-changer in the genre. 

It took me around 16.5 hours to get all the achievements in this game, though some people can probably do it much faster. [spoiler] All in all I'd say, Shen Huixin is still the true path. Give all your teddy bears to her :) [/spoiler]

Positive factor
- real actress give a very different vibe and acting expression than 2d or 3d animated in the mean time real people are more difficult to manage this is a very positive point of this game 

- the camera and picture quality is quite good the brightness the close up shot done nicely make you feel even more ""There""

- it's been a long time that i never see an asian beauty dating sim on steam game most of them use western or animated women this game introduce me to many unfamiliar asian beauty vibe

- First person view , is another very positive factor of this game too because all the girl will look and interact with YOU and many time at a close up range so i have to re-quote myself when i said ""if you watch the trailer and see any girl that shake your heart JUST BUY this game and enjoy the visual is more than worth of the game cost"" for now i just curious about what my name ""GU YI"" means.

- Zero stats management . most dating sim game is about stats management but this game making it simple enough just let you feel the situation and decide , No item No Charming Strange Intelligent or anything that will effect your choice just be  in the moment and use your feeling to choose , therefore FOR THE FIRST RUN THROUGH it's very important to play AS YOU as possible and see to what end your judgement bring . No re-choice , until you reach the end thats the best way to play it first time.there is a best time you can score a high point for each girl you just have to find it.

- Easy rerun , after your first run. 'as a gamer' you just have the urge to explore the rest of the game and that is where the treasure is hidden is this game . there are many time that i have to smile in accepting that there is some beautiful scene hidden in a very specific part of the timeline . 

- End game quiz . Gotta admit that the difficulty of the game just jump when i least expected but it make the game worth playing and let you take your time with the girl you choose more.

- End game content , i really really really love it , no spoiling , fight for it people .it worth!

- it brings back memories. this is also a very big plus of this game . LOVE the emotion that have value in the seeking as much as when it found . and for some people it's long lost feeling of seeking love is very nostalgia and have a special feeling in your heart than your brain . This game make you remember how good the 'love song' and ' broken heart song' is.

Now about Negative Factor

- The chapter sharing of actress. is kind of a let down and some role is a forceful drama induce that is not at all related to your choice make this game not work as it should be if you choose to love a wrong girl at a wrong position of time . your relationship is gone downhill super fast without anything you can do . i hope next time it will be truly choice related and their chapter will be shared better .

- Good choice Bad outcome , because of this is a kind of visual novel instead of game your 'good choice' may not bring best result and you will not know it until you do a Rerun and this also many time hurt my feeling . it's my personal habit to notice girl by their hair style change but the choice want me to ""honestly"" say that i didn't see anything change . come on , not all guy are blind and insensitive.

-Uninteresting and ZERO power the protagonist being. penniless , powerless and even sometimes brainless , heartless (you will know what i means when you play real soon) i have to admit that i feel SUPER pathetic in this body and have to exit the game TWICE to cooldown , until all 6 girls give me enough persuasion to keep going! i hope next time there will be more interesting position for me to play a position that come with some REAL perk or power (even super power is expected)

- some minor bug here and there but acceptable for this is a point and click game not mortal kombat 15

Conclusion

i give this game an 87/100

for me i think 'destiny' is not canon (due to the way you achieve it) but most beautiful moment of this game i personally love it in every way

for me i think the best ending is not the endgame ending (you will know what i means)

i have make a purchase since day 1  and i'm glad that i NEVER see this game during developing , and i feel that's a good thing because the waiting will surely burn my brain. 
Thank you for developer team to bring this game through the pandemic and release it as beautiful as it be 
Thanks for bring me THIS close to all these Asians beauty i (will surely) never know of . 
Thanks for bring me back all those long lost feeling of love seeking moment .
and in the future if it can be i am looking forward to something like this (with something more) i will surely support it.",1698408569,1698684837,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False

The story has two problems. First, it's very short, leaving little room for every girl to shine. For example, first chapter introduces two of them, second adds one more etc. As a result, for most of them the relationship is not given enough time to blossom and feels contrived. The childhood friend suffers the most from this - you briefly interact with her in the middle and then never hear from her again until the end. And second, every girl is forced on you, so if you thought you can just ignore ones you don't care about - well, it's not how it works here. You WILL go home to a divorced mom after first meeting her and you WILL tell her son to call you daddy, because otherwise no matter which choices you make in chapter 5, you get a game over for not getting enough points with her by that point. Similarly, you WILL get drunk and depressed over one of the girls ending up in a relationship with another even if you ignored her for the whole game - because the plot demands it.

[h3]Unlikeable girls[/h3]

Basically, you have to choose between:
- an egotistical party girl, who needs you to carry her home when she's drunk (which she usually is) and cater to her every whim;
- an aging bland boring lady, focused on getting married ASAP because the clock is ticking;
- a divorced mother who's insecure about her inferiority due to being a divorced mother, and dating which also involves ""dating"" her entire family;
- a domineering CEO who's willing to keep you around as her pet and provide for you in exchange for giving up freedom and dignity;
- a clingy childhood friend who has a crush on you and who you basically have to marry in exchange for getting your debt paid off;
- a plain college girl, who is the least toxic of the bunch, but who you'll have to live in poverty with and count every dollar, most likely making such relationship short-lived.

As a result, staying alone feels like the best option here, which IMO completely defeats the point of such a game. Also, no ""content"" here, in case you were wondering.",1698631929,1698631929,False,17,1,0.628046751022338867,0,True,False,False

Plot: 6/10
Story Variety: 9/10
Humour: 10/10 
Fan service/ nudity: None
Casting selection: Impressive
Game UI: 3/10 

Commentary:
You cannot take this game seriously because it's written to appeal to many typical Chinese stereotypes. Most of the humour written into plot is slapstick and excessive levels of *nose-exhales* and chuckles are to be expected. 

The award of best actor in the franchise should certainly go to ""Ah Liu"". 

Think awkward situations involving multiple relationships, random encounters with unexpected people and stalker-ish girls that simply won't leave the MC alone. 

For individuals seeking a lighthearted storyline, this is the perfect slamdunk. Don't expect any sophistication to the plot as the game is pretty much one joke after another. 

If you're simply looking for fap-worthy material, this isn't your type of game. Although, who knows?

My biggest beef with the game is the downright horrible and slow UI. At times, the UI is not instantaneously responsive and suffers significant lag-time before a storyline loads. (This was a MAJOR minus imo). In addition, the game occasionally crashes and requires you to reload the game in order to make things work again. (Really hope it gets patched)

One other beef is the painful experience of having to replay the game multiple times just because you weren't able to gain enough affection points throughout the level. PLEASE FIX THIS and allow users to continue on without affection penalties.  This, coupled with poor UI, really made me want to mark the game as not recommended. 

Seeing how this is Intiny's first project, I wish to commend the efforts of the devs and hope there's more to come.

但就是觉得，很多选择都不太有意义。有些选择，无论怎么选，结果都大同小异。所以就会有种感觉好像男主摇摆不定的感觉？

Everyone is going to point out that the story is silly, but that's the point, it's basically letting men live out a gender-flipped misogynist fantasy of what life is allegedly like for women: so every female character basically wants to love bomb you into oblivion, inundating you with money, gifts, and nearly immediate offers to have you move in with them. Kudos to the main actresses and the actor who plays your best friend, without their efforts I think the silly story would be too silly, but thanks to their sincere acting and effort it's actually pretty effective and fun.

Another way of putting it: if you liked the show Californication, this is basically a very PG-rated version of the same idea, but in a branching path / choose your own adventure format, also everyone is Chinese.

The behind the scenes content is fantastic and it's a lot of fun to hear what the performers thought of the material.

The English subtitles are a little rough. For some reason whenever someone offers to prepare food for someone they say ""I will stand you a meal"" or something like.

The game is well worth the asking price considering they were able to hire very good actresses for their roles. I was really enjoying the game it ended sooner than I would've like it to. I hope we get a sequel or at least another similar type game from this studio they really did good work. 

My only con is that the last three FMC you meet doesn't get as much screen time compared to the first three FMC you meet. You don't get as much time to spend with the last three FMC as you do with the first three FMC.

I played Ten Dates, thought this seemed like a similar game and thought I should at least try it. I played this game with my mate for 5 hours in one sitting because we were so hooked by it. I personally think this game tops Ten Dates, which I wasn't expecting in the slightest coming into this.

Both my mate and I loved the fact that this game feels like there's so much to do. It's not a short game with some branches of events here and there for the characters, quite the opposite in fact. Each character's paths can bleed into other characters' paths, making you have to decide differently than you would normally knowing now ""oh, but this choice could really affect my status with this girl."" I'm in love with the story that's put together, as well with the fact that you don't JUST spend time with the girls. They are the main people you're with, but there are instances where you are out with your guy friend, other side characters you can develop an identity for, etc. This was done so well, and that's what I love most about this game is the thought put into the story and how each choice honestly does kinda matter (especially since you need a certain affection level to even proceed with the story).

I think the acting was well done, and props to the actors considering they are literally only looking at a camera and have to imagine there's an actual attractive guy. That's hard to do, especially when emotional connection with Yi is a consistent theme. The visuals looked really good, there are funny moments, there are sweet moments, and much more. No like really there's so much more. We played this for 5 hours and are like I think barely halfway through achievements...

TL;DR: Really good game, and one that might go overlooked. But I thought it had really good story and has a lot of content packed into it with great acting and some funny moments. Well done developers, 10/10! <3",1697844167,1697844167,True,11,0,0.622698187828063965,0,True,False,False
