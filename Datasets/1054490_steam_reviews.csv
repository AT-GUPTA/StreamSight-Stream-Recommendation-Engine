It will probably take you a few games before you start to get the hang of it, which I think is fun to learn how to play the game and start to think of your own ways to play. After you feel more comfortable with how the game works, you really can start to get creative with what kinds of birds you play as well as seeing all the capabilities of each habitat. 
   Even after 30+ hours of playing this game, each session still feels new and fresh to me, as I still haven't even seen all of the birds this game has to offer, and I am still learning how to use different strategies. There are also multiple DLC's that contain new birds and new mechanics, so if you are worried about the replay ability of this game, there is plenty of content to make this game worth your money.
   The only possible downside of this game is the online multiplayer. Because of the complexity of this game, each person is given 5 minutes for their turn and that can make online games last a very long time. It can be especially frustrating if another player leaves or gets disconnected. I have been disconnected from online for seemingly no reason a few times. To avoid those issues, I recommend using the AI that the game provides. The AI are fast and you can change the difficulty of them.
   Another small quality of life change this game could add is making a tutorial for the 'Automa' mode, or having a page that explains how the Automa bird works. As of right now, there seems to be no real explanation for this mode. I suspect that is because the Automa mode was made for the in person board game version, to be able to play the game by yourself. With the introduction of AI in this online version, there isn't really a need to play the Automa mode, unless you are going for achievements. 
   Overall I highly recommend this game if you like strategy card games and birds!!",1708749937,1708749937,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* Graphics: Colorful 2D pictures of birds and stuff.
* Audio: *scientifically-accurate bird sounds*
* Gameplay: Birds give you points and have special abilities. You make combos to score points. The AI is pretty decent, and there's a ""fake enemy"" variant that lets you know how well you did based on how the desk was shuffled.
* Story: None. Pleasant family-friendly atmosphere. No violence.
* Difficulty: Relatively simple to get into, but not without depth. 
* Multiplayer: It exists but... why not just play the board game?
* Dev: Small team, probably assembled just for this game. Used the Unity Engine, and they seem to be pretty good with it.

One critique is that the tutorial is not very effective. It drags on seemingly forever, repeating things constantly, but the description of actions is strange and sometimes poorly marked on the screen. It also doesn't describe objectives well. There are a few different ways to earn points, but the most important are the objectives for each round and obtaining the highest value birds, the other ways being supplemental. If my first time playing was on the computer, I'd never have known that based on the way the tutorial makes it sound like the round objectives like they're an afterthought. 

Aside from the tutorial, it's great. Very peaceful, educational, and visually appealing. The AI is sufficiently challenging to beat, the set-up onscreen was translated very well from the original board format, and it's overall very enjoyable to play.

The worst is when you play till the 4th round and then someone either doesn't take their turn because they were negligent or they are the victim of a bug themselves. Unlike other games I have played, the AI takeover is not seemless and smooth in such a situation. When the timer runs out it hangs up for a little bit. Then several boxes pop up notifying you that another player took too long to take their turn. It asks if you would like to continue the game with an AI. After clicking the multiple boxes that pop up in such a situation it seems like a roll of the dice if you will then get to complete the game. I have gone several rounds and then had the same AI takeover boxes reappear asking again if I want the AI to play the game. If I accept it reverts back to the spot where the player left, EVEN IF THAT'S A DOZEN TURNS OR MORE AGO! So frustrating! The absolute worst part is there's some other bug occasionally that shows it's still another player's turn. Their timer runs all the way out. Then, instead of asking if I want the AI to take their place it blames ME for not taking MY turn and says I will lose 5 Karma points! Since this is happening MORE not LESS of late, what I wonder is if you get put with lower Karma players the more times you lose Karma points. If so, this will only get worse, not better.

I wish I could recommend this game, but until these bugs are fixed I cannot. Since they have been reported for a while by others and have not been addressed I can only imagine it has to do with some of the core processes of the game?

I just really wish it could be fixed...


UPDATE 10/2021: While I still enjoy this game very much, the online play is what I'm most interested in. Unfortunately, this still has numerous bugs and problems with players quitting or taking too long to play. This means I rarely get to finish a game, which in turn makes me less and less likely to play. In addition, they have not provided any updates reflecting the actual board game expansions. The lack of improvements and expansions seems to have dulled enthusiasm for the game overall as matchmaking is increasingly difficult. There are many times you cannot even get 3 players to join at the same time.

UPDATE 1/29/2024: Continued improvements to the game have limited bugs that used to be so annoying. It's now rare to have an error that ends the game. What still continues to be the one major annoying feature is that you cannot adjust the timer for live multiplayer games. 5 minutes is too long, and when some players take their time to calculate every possible move it can irritate the other player and they decide to leave. Rather than automatically replacing the missing player the timer has to run completely out. Then the game is COMPLETELY replaced by AI, meaning you have to finish the game against the computer or just quit and start again. After playing for 30 minutes or longer this is quite annoying. Options such as single AI replacement would be much better. Also, the ability to select from more than one standard multiplayer game would be nice. The only way you can do that now is to create your own game and invite specific people. There is no lobby the general public can join from except the 3-player 5 minutes a turn live game or the asynchronous non-timed game.

It's really relaxing and fun to play with friends, and the rules aren't complex and feel intuitive. The game is very relaxing - but when you play with a few friends and try to race against the turns to reach the end-of-round goals, you can feel your adrenaline pumping.  The soundtrack is genuinely beautiful, I listen to it while studying all the time.
However, and I say this only for the base game without DLCs, you may find a few rounds where luck isn't on your side. No, there are many really, really good birds in the game, but a few overpowered combinations can basically gift the game to your opponent, so luck can be a factor. But most of the time, this is the case. 
One thing I really like is that the developers give players the option to discard ""Ravens"" from the game, which are OP cards.

overall 10/10 rendition of the board game; There can be some deep strategy if you play your cards right :)

Which is absolutely insane to me. They have a wide gamut of solutions to borrow from other wildly successful DCGs. Yet they pick none of those? Zero market research? That's just a bad look...

Wingspan is a beautiful game. THIS version is a waste of time. 5 minute timers per player per turn. FIVE MINUTES.
No self-respecting player takes five minutes to make up their mind in a card game. That's kind of player who doesn't get invited to the next board game night...

Other reviewers are mentioning this too, but I cannot stress how problematic this is, stretching what would have been a diverting hour to much much longer. It's an issue that is compounded by the fact that if a player disconnects (eg: they get fed up with waiting for another player to decide which bird is prettier...) the WHOLE MATCH ENDS. Remaining players are given the option to play an AI game... alone...

The AI isn't bad, but I guarantee you bought this game to compete with your fellow humans. Want to play alone? Go buy the REAL BOARD GAME. The Automata mode is good enough for that.

The developers need to revamp the turn timer system ASAP for online play. I cannot recommend this game as it is. There's are perfectly serviceable versions in Tabletop Simulator and Board Game Area for playing with your friends.

3-person online games allow 5 minutes per opponent turn. Too often they are running 2+ games so they take a full 5 minutes EVERY turn x 27 turns to complete their action.

Absolutely the worst tutorial in any game I have ever played. The tutorial is completely nonlinear. You will have no idea why you ought to do one thing vs. do another thing.

The only way that works is to watch many of the various strategy guide videos posted online. Obviously some are better than others. Pay special attention to the opening part of the game, it's crucial to understand how to get started properly.

There's absolutely no way one could understand what to do and why to do it and when to do it without extensive lessons from someone capable of explaining all of the little intricacies.

I typically baulk at digital implementations of tabletop games even if they're done well. Often, much of the charm and enjoyment of the tabletop game is attenuated in the journey to the screen.

However, Wingspan is not only a superb implementation, but one that has managed to not only match but in some ways enhance the experience. The addition of the audio bird facts, the beautiful music, and animations fit well & are smoothly integrated. The overall look and feel fits the game perfectly. It's a very relaxing experience.

Regarding solo play, you can play against AI or the Automa - I'm very pleased that they included the latter, as I play the Automa offline and you can see how it's managing itself (a good way to learn the offline Automa or fact-check your running of the Automa).

Regarding multi-player, you can play real-time or asynchronously (which is a really nice feature if you can't be sure you'll be available for a chunk of time.)

There's an interesting weekly challenge with a leader-board too.

At time of writing, the European and Oceania expansions are available and again expertly and beautifully done. For me, Oceania is an essential expansion because the new player boards & nectar really open the game up and make play more flexible.

Massive props to the team who put the digital version together. I have still not found another digital implementation of any game I am willing to play, but this I absolutely adore.",1610427845,1705110858,True,2,0,0.537241101264953613,0,True,False,False

Learn their brief history
Hear their sound 
See nice animations and illustrations of a wide range of birbs

Even if you do not have the dlcs, you can still experience them for free in online. (Most players activate their dlc pack so you also gain it during the game)

Also it is quite valuable and balanced as a strategy card game. Of course luck would help to win but you can still make great strategies and save your game even if your cards are not as useful. 

Only (-) is that I'd like a better competitive system. 
You cannot see your stats (for example wins/loses or previous maches (if you do not specifically save them to archive right after a game) ) 
Also there is kind of a rank system to match you with successful players but its not so detailed and only based on the matches you completed (no matter what your score is) 
And lastly, you cannot create a party with your friends to join a matchmaking online with other players. 

But other than that, the game is quite fun and its even better if you like birbs as I do. Maybe the best birb concept game I've ever played. I also own the real board game version and its so beautifully created, especially the bird feeder and quality of cards are amazing. 
Even the online feature is not so detailed yet, its great to make a custom game to play with your friends. You can make your own tournament with a prize for the winner at the end. (But then your friends will think that you are being overly competitive every time they see you play the game by yourself, lol)

The virtual form is delightful, the UI is easy to navigate and use, the music is pleasant (although I no longer listen to it after a couple of hundreds of hours of game time), the moving birds’ effects and their voices recordings are lovely, and I appreciate the little pieces of trivia about them. 

I almost exclusively play the online version with another two random players, with 5 minutes for each per turn. I usually run the game on the side when I sit to do some work on my PC that does not require much concentration, so I do not mind if people are taking their time with their turns and do not see it as a problem. Random connection issues and rage-quits by players that lead to the online session rendered void are not too common, so I do not think getting in the higher karma levels, where these things occur even more rarely is too challenging. In any case, make sure you have at least an hour of free time before heading into the online session with other players, to make sure you do not need to leave unexpectedly 😊

I have come to favor the digital version over the very high-quality board game version, the game is that good.

Just as with the board game, the birds are the stars. What the digital version adds that the board game cannot is animation and calls for the individual birds. The game is near the line in terms of complexity, IMHO, where it makes as much or more sense to automate the rules than to leave the players to do it themselves. I still play the board game version, and players inevitably forget to use the pink powers of their birds, fail to place their round tokens, etc. Having the computer take care of all that means that my digital games typically run as fast or faster than my board games with no cleanup afterwards.

The main complaint I have is the karma system used for online matchmaking. You lose 5 karma if you time out / miss your turn, and then you get matched with other players that also have lower karma and are more likely to leave or disconnect. Getting karma back is nearly impossible. You only regain 1 karma for a fully completed online game. If any opponent leaves early (even an hour into the game!!!), you get nothing.

Last year, it was Dorfromantik, this year, it is Wingspan. I had heard much about Wingspan from my board game friends but due to not really having the community with which to play, I gave it a pass. I picked this game up on a lark (get it?) and completely fell in love with it. 

Wingspan is a charming engine building game with warm artwork and pastoral vistas. The goal is to build your game engine through use of card draws and resource management. The tutorial the game provides is a wonderful introduction but the game lets you figure out which birds have great synergy with each other (Ravens+Killdeer/Franklin's Gull is a favorite). There is a competitive element between the 2 to 5 players in the game but there is not a potential for aggression like in Catan or Dominion, you pretty much build your own engine and see how you did against everyone. As a result, this game is ridiculously soothing, helped by the atmospheric music that my infant daughter adores. My only moments in frustration in this game are noticing someone snagging the Ravens or Flamingo before I can get to them or not being able to get a resource I need at a critical time.

With the two expansions this is an utterly fantastic game.

Examples of strategic thinking would be choosing what end of round goals to go for, what rows to focus on and how they will interact, and playing toward your bonus cards. Strategic thinking is looking opportunistically for combos and ways of being efficient in the various ways they appear. 

The art direction is superb, offering every bit of the tabletop version and then some (the animated birds, player mat, narrator, backrounds, etc) . Likewise, the music by Pawel Gorniak (no accents because of my keyboard) - string-dominated indie-folk/classical fare with plaintive melodies and sustained moods - is superbly effective.

Fantastic board game video game. It's so rare to get a board game video game that isn't cheaply made and/or full of game-breaking bugs, but I've yet to encounter any bugs, and the presentation here is really great!

I originally gave this a thumbs up because whatever short comings this port has, the actual board game is amazing. But let's be honest here, the computer version is just atrocious-- and I mean atrocious to the point where I feel like I got scammed by buying it. It's lazy, incomplete, and lacks the basic features that you need to have to have a functional online game:

No time controls (Holy crap. Buckle up because your options are Long games. Yeah that's it. There are no time controls, you can only play excessively long games with turn timers in the minutes. 

There's no MMR or any type of sensible matchmaking. 

Despite the above, they've released two DLC to expand the game. I get that the assets are there from the board game and there isn't much more work involved, but it is more than a little audacious to repeatedly ask for money when you didn't deliver the original product in the first place. 

This is borderline a scam. And I swing back around to the DLC. They could fix every issue here within a month to meet the absolute bare minimum required for an online game that you play against other people. But they haven't and it's clear that they won't. 

Why? Great question. There is no possible explanation to that question. I don't know who the developer Monster Couch is, but I hold them in the utmost contempt, as human beings

Wingspan's a great game, and it can be everything from from casual fun with a bird theme to the ecology version of Factorio, if you really want to delve deep into planning ahead and running a highly efficient scoring machine. It's a puzzle in all of the good ways, none of the bad. I will admit it has a few flaws both in game design and ornithology-reallismness (It annoys me you can use an egg from any bird to hatch a new one, for example), but they're all very easy to forgive since it's entertainment first, education second and all the overt stated facts and trivia is correct.  

This digitization of it is superb. They could have gone for good enough, but the aesthetic, music, voice acting and sound direction is all done so well. The worst thing about Wingspan was always the time it took to play with the physical board, the double-checking rules and so on. The digital version replaces all of that with a pleasant soundscape, great animations, beautiful bird-calls as you activate a bird. It's more Wingspan than Wingspan.

I learned how to play the game itself from this version.

It may be confusing at first due the clutter of the UI but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a fantastic strategy game. 
I'm not even crazy about card games and I usually avoid them.

Simply put, you have 4 actions to pick from each turn:
- Play a bird [in their corresponding environment, some birds live in multiple environments (3 total)]
- Take Food [used mostly to play birds]
- Lay eggs [used mostly to play birds and counts toward your final score]
- Draw a bird Card [in order to play, gain points and benefit from their powers]
You line up your bird cards to benefit from their powers in such a way that helps you gain advantage over other players (more food, eggs or cards etc). Of course there is some luck involved.

There is two types of goals to gain extra points from:
- Bonus Goal (that's your personal goal depending on the card you get in the beginning or from some birds during the game)
- End of Round Goals (randomized 4 goals each game)

I jumped in blind and the game took me by surprise. I'm glad I gave it a chance.

If you've never played Wingspan before, there is a bit of a learning curve but not too bad.  The game mechanics are of medium complexity, but the tutorial takes you through them fairly well.  There are a couple of things that could be more intuitive, but overall I'd say it plays smoothly.  You don't have to be a bird lover to enjoy this game.  I'm not and I still find it compelling.  The things that made this game moderately famous when it was released were the quality of components, the beauty of the graphics, and the dedication to authenticity with regards to each of the many birds contained within.

The digital version is a very faithful adaptation of the physical game. While it can feel a bit isolated since you only see one player's board at a time compared to the physical version in some regards it's actually better. The played birds are animated and they play the bird's sound, both when played and continously when viewing the habitat that bird is played in. That's super cool! There are also a couple of board game skins that you can choose from.

What makes Wingspan so special is that it caters to a wide variety of players. You just want to relax and play your favorite birds without caring about scores? You can do that. You want to focus on balancing cool birds while also focusing on the goals to score? You can do that. You want to create a powerful engine that nets you as many bonus resources as possible during your tun? You can do that. 

The replay value of the game is also huge. Between the ridiculous amount of birds available and the randomness of goals, bonus cards and available birds pretty much means that no match will be the same.

Only negative for me is that the real time online matches are on a 5 minutes per turn timer. This means that playing with people that overthink their turns makes matches an agonizing slog where you have to wait up to 10 minutes until you are allowed to make your own 10 seconds turn after which you have to wait minutes again.

I have not played the boardgame of wingspan.
I even have ""Board Game"" and ""Card Game"" filtered in Steam!

But-- and it's a big BUT-- I LOVE this one!

The art is so, so beautiful. It's so detailed and everything feels full of life.
The music is super chill and atmospheric. Even the effects are relaxing and fun.
The gameplay is easy to pick up and much fun and feels really intuitive.
The rules of the game are quite easy but you really need to pick a strategy to win-- perfect balance.

Like I said, I do not know the board game, but this one actually feels more like an actual PC game and not simply a boardgame you can play on PC. At least for me.

The game seems simple, but actually is quite deep and interesting,. but the overall concept is easy to understand.

The only thing missing from the PC version is kind of a story mode that progresses with birds until the end.

Pros: 
-Both the music and artistry are rich and vibrant, providing an extremely pleasant ambiance to the game's overarching theme: Birds!

-The abilities of the birds, themselves, provide a nice bit of mechanics that correspond to how they are IRL.

-Some of the bonus cards that you get are dependent on certain aspects of the birds, such as how big a bird's wingspan is and add a layer of mechanics that's actually pretty nice.

Cons:
-The tutorial overloads the player from the get-go with mechanics right on the very first minute. The pacing is extremely poor and really kinda confused me with how each layer of interaction worked with another.

-The game utilizes three separate boards to set up your birds. I'm personally not a big fan of this since this game could have been heavily optimized via using a singular board with different segments on it rather than how it's implemented now. (E.G. Have the deck where you draw your birds on one corner of the board, the eggs be a separate space on another part, and so forth.)

-The game was only responsive half of the time with my controller. I would have to switch to my keyboard and mouse to let the game ""unstick"" itself before being able to use my controller again. I thought it had crashed a few times, but a quick mouse movement and random keyboard face-roll always seemed to fix it.
-------------------------------------
Overall, I won't recommend this game. However there are some very obvious strengths to those who are both avid bird watchers and bird hobbyists alike. While the game's artwork and music is extremely top-notch, the mechanics that the game introduces you to are a-plenty from the get-go and the different layers of the board itself can be extremely frustrating to deal with. There were also controller issues during gameplay that could only be remedied via switching to keyboard and mouse to ""unstick"" the game.",1699670795,1699670795,False,1,0,0.476377934217453003,0,True,False,False

As someone who played an embarrassing amount of CCGs and card games (even competitively on both fronts) I find it easy to recognize Wingspan boils down to an engine building game. Unfortunately it just doesn't really feel like it achieves nice pacing in the process.

The goal is to fill your board with birds, birds with astonishing titles preferably. These birds will synergize in some way with the current game state. If birds abide by some inherent property they may or may not be eligible for some randomized objective at the end of the round. Your hand is small. Bad luck ensues and it stays small. The game ramps up in intensity as the rounds progress, but will consequently also be shorter.

Player interaction is non-existent. Other people play their own little game of pretending their respective birds are action figures or something. Occasionally a bird materializes that interacts with the board state in a way that can be influenced by another player. That's pretty much all interaction there is. Other players are more like external automata that might or might not tweak the variables in your favor.

As your engine starts to display signs of age right after its conception the game will consistently punish you as it progresses as falling behind is, for some reason, doubly punished by the way the game is laid out; the higher rewards come from being able to build your engine faster. On top of well... having an engine to do things to begin with. It's a very strange design and I'd love to have someone explain me the rationale behind it. The consequence is that those off to a bad start will pretty much never catch up.

Wingspan is quirky, but feels like a very flawed board game to me.",1699458325,1699458325,False,4,0,0.48780485987663269,0,True,False,False

Almost recommended. But with a sad face I'm gonna have to say no.
tldr is good atmosphere/pretty, crap ui

You mostly get the advertised serene atmosphere. Problem is this is combined with a UI that is very obviously crap, and it over complicates what is really a simple game. For no apparent reason, you can't see all the relevant info for a card without shifting through different screens or scrolling. You cannot see the whole board unless you switch the view, which makes it take extra steps to see all information for a card. This is really awful and makes simple calculations a total pain unless you've memorized every effect of every card (not happening any time soon). 

The tutorial is entirely overwhelming, again partly because the UI makes simple concepts confusing and some aren't at all explained well. The learning curve should be simpler if you've played the physical card game, which I haven't. After playing a tutorial that's like half an hour long, and 2 full games, I kind of know what I'm doing. 

I like this game and I'm upset how much the UI makes it annoying to play. It does make me want to get the physical card game though. If you can deal with UI being pretty clunky, this is fun especially if you have a friend to play against.",1698785314,1698813154,True,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

ONLINE MODE - I haven't tried it, but other reviews say it has its downs.

AUTOMATA MODE - I was in love with this game till I tried the automata, this mode is completly unsatisfing. Tbh this brought me to write this review. The automata is SUCH a crap, it's hard to ignore. UI is very confusing, much different for automata than for the player, so you just can't understand what is going on at your opponent's turn. Nothing is signed, even though there is a space for that. I did not play the paper version of the game, so I don't know if the opponent's cards are to be seen there, but in the automata mode you can't see automata's card, even though when playing offline you can see other players' cards. The card visibility adds a lot to the game mechanics, making everything much more tactical. While in the automata mode you just can't react tactically on what the automata is doing. IT IS SO F** CONFUSING. All the gameplay just looses its point, it become just a fancy solitaire.

To top it all off, you are also treated to an interesting fact about each bird.  You don't have to be a bird enthusiast to love this game, but you will probably like them more after playing a couple times.

Learning the game can be a little complicated at first; however, the creators provide thorough instructions, an online video tutorial, a step-by-step walk-through of four turns between two or three people, and supplemental appendices for quick/easy access to further explanations.  At least, that is what is in the physical game.  I already knew how to play before enjoying it on Steam, so I am not sure how good the introduction is on here.  There were a couple mechanics we had to figure out with this online interface, but we had it down after a game or two.

I think the gameplay is great for a few reasons.  First, this is not an offensive/defensive, cut-throat ordeal.  Each player has their own board and focuses mainly on themselves.  There are a couple ways that players are affected by others, but it is usually not significant.  This is perfect for a relaxing experience, even if you have an overly-competitive group/family that is usually plagued by arguments and/or hurt feelings (like  with Munchkin).

Second, there are so many ways to earn points that you can either give your mind a good workout or just go with the flow and easily pivot to a new strategy when something does not go your way.  Combine this flexibility with the huge variety of cards and card types, and you also get major replayability.

The third thing I like is how many options there are for setting it up: from the number of players (1-5), to the difficulty level of scoring, to the interesting expansion packs they continue to produce.  Yes, you can even play solo, which is called Automa. I often do this because I enjoy playing games more than my friends and family (not to mention it takes less time).  The odd thing about Automa is that it is set up totally differently for the imaginary opponent (even in the physical version).  You play the same as you always would but the computer is doing something crazy different, so I am never sure if my cards/actions will have the same effect they would against real people.  Ultimately, I still enjoy Automa, especially since I started adjusting the scoring settings (I was getting my butt kicked every time, even on the easy mode!).",1696309924,1696309924,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

if any player fails to make their move within the 5 minute timer, 1 of 2 things happen:
1. all opponents are replaced with AI
OR
2. the whole game simply ends. 

this is an unacceptable waste of time.

I've started almost 10 online games and only ever finished ONE game to the end (with all human players).

this could easily be fixed by either:
1. randomizing that player's move at the 5 min mark
2. having AI make a single move at the 5 min mark
OR 
3. completely skipping that player's turn at their loss. 

any of these is better than auto ending the game after investing 30 min+ (usually closer to 60 min)

until this is fixed, this negative review will remain

The game itself is addictively fun and replayable, and this PC adaptation of it is really well-done, adding some nice mellow background music (I actually liked one of the songs - My Realm - enough to add it to my Spotify), interesting facts about some birds when you play them, and a pretty well-done UI. I do wish that when another player's card affects me (such as their card letting me lay an egg on my bird), the UI would let me hover something *while on my own board* to see the full details of the card affecting me without having to fully switch to that player's board to look at it, but that's a fairly minor complaint.

We never played until we tried our hand at the digital edition, and we fell in love after one play through. If you play board games (for reference, I own around 50 modern board games), it's easy enough to pick up on, but the replay-ability and depth within those mechanics keeps us returning night after night. I like that there's just enough different ways to win that you need to cater your strategy differently each time you play. And since you only have a limited amount of turns each game, you need to efficiently determine that best strategy based on the hand you were dealt (literally and figuratively). This style makes it easy to find yourself in a situation in which you'd eventually benefit from playing every bird that comes with the game - which is something WILD like >100 different species. 

I'd also like to highlight the attention to detail on the backgrounds, music, bird drawings, bird facts, and bird calls. It creates a calm and pleasant atmosphere in ""nature"" to look at while you're waiting for your turn. It's fun to look into the details of the drawings as well as their bird facts. I'm not positive, but as an amateur birder myself these facts all seem well-informed and genuine, along with the bird calls they make, which is so freaking COOL for the vast library they have. Learning more about each species is special and exciting to us as both board game and bird nerds. I'm impressed that the creator was able to make an awesome board game that also gets people to learn and appreciate more about birds. Even if you don't like birds, but you like board games, you are bound to enjoy this gem. 

Lastly, I applaud that beta AI on hard mode is already succeeding well with challenging our game play and strategy adaptation mid-game. We usually beat them, but it tends to be a battle and they occasionally beat us.",1693062477,1693062477,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The board game is one that you can fall in love with immediately, from the card art to the easy-to-learn hard-to-master nature of the rules. The digital version incorporates a beautiful soundtrack that is worth a listen by itself and sound effects for all the birds.

Best of all, it provides a way to connect with friends and family to play, albeit if everyone owns their own copy of the game. For this reason I would generally recommend buying it on sale when you can buy 4-5 copies for the same price as the hard copy game.

There are drawbacks though. I have been rather addicted to the game, playing on both Steam and mobile.  I enjoy playing the 3 player real-time mode against random opponents but if you are looking for great matchmaking you won't find it here.

Every time you are the first to leave a game it ends the multi-player session. This can happen anywhere from the first card draw to 45 minutes in. Some players wait until the last few seconds of every action to take turns so I have had several 
""real time"" games more than an hour. If anyone leaves, poof, game is done. It turns to an AI game, but it just isn't the same.

Further, the game appears to have a bug (probably based on connection) that will show a player's timer counting down, reach zero, and then tell you that **you** left the game and will lose Karma. When you lose karma you match more often against other people with bad karma. You need to COMPLETE online games to regain karma.
This means once you lose two or three eggs of karma you will never earn them back. Most of your games will end with a player leaving (or worse, experiencing the bug that forces you to leave unimtentionally).

Can't recommend this game positively enough to enjoy with family.
Can't in good faith say that without mentioning the flaws with random multi-player. It could be the best part of the game, and is instead the most frustrating and demoralizing.",1692155095,1692155095,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

☐ You forget what reality is
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

The graphics are nicely done. They appear to be handdrawn images. The artstyle is very pretty and seems to match the original physical cardgame perfectly. Except here you also get simple but cute animations on everything.

---{ Gameplay }---
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

My only complaint with gameplay is the tiny amount of actions per round and amount of rounds.
This is fine if you just want to play a quick 30 min session against the AI. It does increase the stress a the final few actions though, especially during the laughably short last round. IF you are playing this at a LAN party however, you may want a session to last a little longer. This is something that could easily be fixed by implementing the possibility for ""houserules"". Many other virtualized boardgames allow for that these days.


---{ Audio }---
☐ Eargasm
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

Audio is neither anything special, nor especially bad. The music is calm and soothing. However the limited amount of racks makes repetive in the long run. My onlu complaint is that the backgrounds do not change the sound effects or birds heard as bg effects at all. Kind of a missed opportunity. This is especially noticable when using seasonal or city themed backgrounds.
Bonus points for having the voiced over tutorial.
Bonus points for including the calls/songs/sounds of every bird. Also, each bird has more then one call represented in game, kudos! Audio quality is also really good.


---{ Audience }---
☑ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☑ Grandma

Anyone remotely interested in boardgames, cardgames or birds really.
Definitly a family frindly game. In this particular case that is not a detriment at all.

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☑ Potato
☐ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

It runs on a potato, when Eunuckity Engine remembers that it's (kinda sorta) a game engine.
And when the game does not willy-nilly requires an SSD to get past the splash-screen. MOre on that in the bugs section.

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

Easy to learn hard to master. Good tutorial which actually explain things properly, a rare thing to see these days (or at all really). Although sometimes the AI is so good that I'm convinced it's actually cheating... Once the AI had no birds in the grassland (where you gain eggs), but still beat me by having 20+ more eggs then me.... Just WTF!? HOW!?

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☑ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

Basically, ""grind"" only boils down to unlocking all the birdcars in your library. Very odd and kinda pointless really. If you have the cardgame, nothing stops you from flipping thorugh the decks to simply look at the artwork. On the plusside, you can listen to birdcalls and trivia from the gallery.

---{ Story }---
☑ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

The story: ou have a bird sanctuary. SO does your freinds. You want to one up each other by attractingthe ""best"" birds. That's all folks!

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☑ To infinity and beyond

While a session can be played through in anything from 30 minutes to an hour, the longevity of this game comes mainly from the endless replay value.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

I picked it and all DLC's up on a sale, because moeny is tight and because I have no experience of the physical game. If you have the money, the asking price seems rather fair though. Hoping against hope the devs get enough of a revenue to swap to an actually competent engine and dump Eunuckity Engine altogether though....

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

For some reason it stopped loading past the splash screen on my fastest HDD. Simply moving the game over to an SSD did nothing, I had to completly wipe the games folder and reinstall from scratch.
Also, everytime I try to qit the game, it hinges. Thank you Eunickity Engine, I hate you too!

Also, keyboard and mouse controls could stand a complete makeover. You also cannot rebind anything, which (besides already using Eunuckity Engine, devs selling their souls to Cthulhu) is kind of an unofrgivablething in a modern game. Just because the game works beautifully with my Xbox COntroller, does not mean I want to be forced to use it in order to play the game.


Final Score
---{ 8 / 10 }---
☐ 1
☐ 2
☐ 3
☐ 4
☐ 5
☐ 6
☐ 7
☑ 8
☐ 9
☐ 10

I had to knock of a point for the use of Unity Engine (aka it's true name Eunuckity-Burning-Garbage-Powered-By-Dead-Dreams-And-Sacrifical-Puppies-Engine), which is a notoriously piss-poor engine and also difficult to optimize properly no matter if you are an indie dev or have multiple billions to spend on game development. With the migration to a new engine, allowing for houserules, fixing the mouse and keyboard controls (and did I mention a swap of game engine?) and maybe an AI tweak or five this game has the potential to become a 10/10.

 -There is no way to change the control settings, you'll manage using only LMB but you can't change the short cuts to your liking.
 -It has happened to me twice where the game just wont let you out from the menu, no matter what you do and if this happens while in a game the only way out is to alt F4 out of the game.

By default you can only look at one habitat at a time. The menu that lets you look at your whole board also makes you toggle between the bird's basic information and their ability text. Thus, it makes it very hard to see what every player is doing at one time when you need to toggle either between information within their boards or toggle between habitats that show all this info. As a result, I feel less engaged in the game than when I play in person or even on BoardGameArena. I'll keep this game around to play the expansions which aren't currently on BGA, but if BGA ever gets the EU expansion or future OCE expansion, this version is dead to me. 

I'd gladly support this version more if it:
- had a view that lets you see all aspects of one player's board on one screen without any toggling.
- allowed for all players to complete their initial hand simultaneously.
- had more settings to remove broken bird cards (e.g. the power four) from the game. 
- made it easier to track moves that opponents are doing live, rather than getting quick summary blurbs of all other players' turns at once. 

Until then, I'll probably just stick to BGA unless I have an itch for the expansions. Games there are much faster and more engaging to play.",1687891526,1687927761,False,13,1,0.596706092357635498,0,True,False,False

Recommend for multiplayer? NO.

Turns are 5m PER PERSON! WAY too long. A turn should be 3 mins with everyone choosing what to do at the same time, followed by trigger actions. One game lasts 2-4 hours! Ridiculous!

Also, there is a glitch where everything you do for the goal doesn't count on the final turn. For example, you have 6 eggs, last turn you lay 4 more. It will only say you had 6 for that entire round instead of the correct value of 10. 
Multiplayer skips your turn on trigger actions.
Multiplayer changes order each round, skipping you.

Single player is pretty good except for not counting everything you do in the last turn, which has cost me a lot of games as you're basically setting everything up for that last turn or two.

Devs need to shorten turn time and fix issues.

I haven't played a ton of board games but I picked it up quickly. I have played for 18 hours and I've still only seen a little over half of the bird cards, so there is a ton of content. Each game has different goals, so you will have a different strategy each time which is really fun. I have not bought the european expansion and the base game is so good I'm in no rush to get it, so I probably will buy it if I see it on sale,

I have only played the digital copy of this game, and they did an amazing job on it. I have mostly played against the ai, which on its hardest setting I am beating most of the time. I usually play 1v1 vs ai, but with more ai opponents it is more difficult to win. The online games are fun too, it defaults to a 3 player game and each player has 5 minutes to make their turn. I've played a few games and never had anyone drop out. I think it may put in an ai player if someone does drop out of a game. I also played it with some friends and it was great, they picked it up quickly and the game just looks so pretty on a big tv.

The music is so nice and relaxing, and the backgrounds are gorgeous. I love the seasonal backgrounds, my favorite is the cherry blossom one. The bird cards are so cute too. The birds are animated (beautifully) when they're played on the board and they do their call when they are played. Also if it is the first time playing that card, there will be a voiceover with a fun fact about that bird(this feature can be turned off).

I like playing the real world version and have played it MANY times, but in this poorly-designed version, they vibrate the cards back and forth, so if you're sensitive to motion, it will make you sick. There is no way to turn off this superfluous motion. Also, the interface is confusing and clunky. This is disappointing because the board game is really beautifully done. It's a shame this doesn't compare to it. Save your money.

!!!! EDIT !!! I changed my review to YES!

After trying the game again, I found there is a setting that allow you to turn off the animations! I'm so glad, because I'm really enjoying it now!!! The only annoying and vertiginous animation is in the opening screens, so I have to close my eye while it loads or it makes me dizzy.  But the rest of the game is great -- nothing make me dizzy!

I'm glad I tried again because it's a damned good game! Very fun interface, simple to play. The games are not too long, but are long enough to get invested in and give your brain a moderate workout.

It's pretty addicting, with easy replay. And the AI opponent is very good, which you can set to easy, normal, or hard depending on mood. (I only play single player.)

The graphics are just lovely and fanciful, and the subtle realistic bird sounds are quite a whimsical treat!

Pros:
- The core gameplay is awesome. Anyone who has the board game knows this is one of the best engine building games out 
  there. I won't get into the details too much, but the beautiful artwork, variety of strategies to employ, and vast numbers of 
  bird cards keeps the game fresh and very engaging. It is both simple and complex at the same time.
- Soundtrack is nice and relaxing. A great stress reliever.
- Custom games with friends or discord community is the way to go here.
- Achievements are fun to go for.
- Some people complain about the interface, but I actually think they did a great job with this.

Cons:
- My biggest gripe with this game is the karma system. Man does it suck, and I do not understand why developers have not 
  fixed it yet (Yes I sound whiney, but I have good reason to be). You start the game at 50 karma. Every time you win a 
  game, you get +1 karma. If you leave a game before the ending, you get -5 karma. You will be matched typically with 
  people of the same karma level , so you are incentivized to play through the game, otherwise over time you will be 
  matched with other leavers. I have no issue with this aspect. The worst part about it is that if someone leaves a game or 
  times out before the conclusion, that game becomes null and void for the other 2 players (meaning I can't gain karma). 
  Why can't they have a computer take over for the person who leaves, but have the other 2 stay in the game and gain the 
  karma? Beats me! 
- 5 minutes per turn is too long for online games. I don't mind 5 minutes at the beginning when you are picking your 
  starting cards, but 5 minutes per turn is a slog. Sometimes people will rope you if they are losing. They need to change 
 game times to 3 minutes.
- No ranked/competitive. I wish they had this available for those who want it, but have casual mode too.
- The AI, even on hard mode, is not that challenging. 
- There are 4 birds (both Ravens, Killdeer, Franklins Gull) that are extremely OP and are typically an instant win if someone 
  puts these in their grassland early in the game. Probably the worst balancing issue with the core gameplay.

Overall:
The game, at its core, is 10/10
However, I can only give the online version a 7/10 because the cons I have outlined above, primarily the karma system.

I've seen a review of the tabletop board game, and as far as I can tell, the digital version replicates the look and feel of that game precisely, with the bonus that the beautifully rendered bird illustrations are animated. Ultimately, that's window dressing, but it's still a very pleasing touch which simply adds to the overall charm. And while I appreciate it's probably not everyone's cup of tea, the soundtrack, I find, really complements it perfectly. An adjective frequently used in connection with Wingspan is ""relaxing,"" and on this level, it certainly is - it's a pleasant microcosm to come to after the working day is done. 

As to the gameplay... The digital recreation of the game seems smooth and flawless, and I love the ""3-D"" treatment permitting easy movement between habitats - a lot of thought seems to have gone into the translation of the visual elements from the physical version to this digital version. And I have to say that I love that the digital version handles all the admin - one of the great frustrations of even the best table-top games - so you can just concentrate on what you're there for playing the game itself (but a disclaimer is needed; I also love tabletop games, admin and all, and am considering getting a physical version). 

I'd agree with other assessments about the skill level of the game; the principle is relatively simple - playing it well (or, well enough) is the hard part; there's a lot of strategy involved, and it's helpful to be able to think two or three steps ahead to make the most of your available resources. But, for me, one of the great things about Wingspan is that it's so nice to play that I actually don't care about winning; it really is all about playing the game, and having a good - and maybe learning - experience doing so. So, for me it's also great that, as well as the ""Automa"" solo mode (which I gather replicates a facility in the tabletop game), the game also offers the option to play against AI opponents, each with three pre-set skill levels - I  play against two AI competitors at ""Normal"" level and that, for me, is a pleasantly challenging experience, where I win often enough to not get discouraged, but losing often enough to feel there's still something to strive for.       

There are a couple of slight drawbacks - I find some of the abilities granted to the birds to be a little repetitive, particularly ""Draw a card/Discard a card."" which has never been one of my favourite mechanics in any game. But, that's a matter of personal preference and therefore a minor drawback, but I do wonder whether it would have been possible to widen the range of abilities to add greater variety. 

The other drawback has been commented on in other forums; the engine-building aspect doesn't feel organically connected to the subject matter. That's especially true later in the game, if the way the game has gone ends up in a card-draw/card-tucking frenzy - with a limited number of turns 
(or, in context, should that be ""terns""?) remaining and a handful of cards available to tuck under birds on the table, I find it's possible to cease caring about the birds themselves and focus more on the engine-building. And that's a level of ruthlessness at odds with what is, otherwise, a very gentle game, and possibly a slightly more serious drawback.

But, these aside, I love Wingspan, and I really look forward to playing it for many more hours to come.",1683654274,1683654274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is easily one of the best board game adaptations I've played, and for players familiar with Wingspan this digital edition enhances the board game by letting us hear the sound of every bird when clicking on them. I love the small touch of making the birds move, and the soundtrack have plenty of tracks that are beautiful and relaxing.

Cons:
The full overview of the gameboard isn't as good as the board game, so you're likely going to be viewing one habitat at a time. But the four people I've introduced this game to haven't found this to be an issue. Personally I don't even think about it anymore, to the point I find it unfair to call this a con, but it's definitely something you'll notice in your first game if coming from the board game.

My only complaint is when playing the computer, you don't see its moves and learning the interactions is slower. Playing even one game with another human, where you see everything, was necessary for me to really understand how everything worked. That being said, the game has two styles of AI mode, so it's easy to play alone. Game also saves state, so the usual hour long game can be broken into segments if time necessitates - several games can be stored at one time, too.

The cool stuff: 
[list]
[*]The game automatically tracks your total egg capacity and how many eggs you have total, progress towards bonus cards, each player's progress towards the current round goal, cached food, and number of tucked cards.
[*]Aesthetics are very charming and fitting. Music is calming and fits the pace of the game, graphics on the avatars are very cute.
[*]All bird arts are animated.
[*]All birds play a sound clip when played or activated. The sound clips are all actual sounds the birds make, taken from Cornell's Ornithology Lab, meaning you can get better at ID'ing birds from sound by playing.
[/list]

The problems:
[list]
[*]The game does a [i]very[/i] poor job of communicating what your opponents have done. This is a huge issue and has many facets:
[olist] 
[*]While it is possible to spectate an opponent's board, there are no animations to show things like what food opponents have taken, where they have lain eggs, where they have drawn cards from, etc. The game state just ""jumps"" from the state it was in before they took their turn to the state it is in after they take their turn. This means that if you want to figure out exactly what your opponent did on their turn, you have to reconstruct it yourself from context clues by looking at the birdfeeder, the bird tray, etc. and remembering what it was like before. This is tedious, and especially problematic in the online environment because two players can, say, take back-to-back turns in quick succession where the first player draws a face-up bird, then the next player draws the face-up bird that replaces it. If you're not paying extremely close attention, it's quite possible to completely miss what bird your opponent just took, which is something that's supposed to be public information!
[*]After the opponent takes their turn, a speech bubble will appear under their avatar stating which of the four main actions (play bird, gain food, lay eggs, draw cards) they took. However, it doesn't tell you which abilities they activated, unless they directly affect you. While it is usually possible to reconstruct their actions from context clues, this is tedious, and there are corner cases where it is completely impossible to tell if they've activated an ability.
[*]No way to see how many cards are in opponents' hands, meaning you have to track it yourself.
[*]No way to see which bird/bonus cards have been discarded. While discarded cards do not have a direct effect on the game, they can still be an important source of [i]information[/i], as you can gain some amount of insight into what your opponents are planning based on what cards they've discarded, and knowing what bonus cards are still in the deck can change your value assessment of birds that give you bonus cards.
[/olist]
[*]If you have a large number of cards in your hand (10+), it can be annoying to click on the card you want to play due to your hand being confined to a small area of the screen and there being no way to expand it to fill more of the screen.
[*]Online modes are generally lacking. There's just a quickplay option and a custom game mode you can invite friends to. There is no way to change the ruleset in quickplay: from what I can tell, it will always be a 3-player game, with European expansion on.
[*]There is no skill-based matchmaking system. If you're interested in competitive and want to find strong players to play against you have to use third-party channels like Discord.
[*]There is no in-game chat, and players you've matched with do not show up in Steam's ""Recently Played With"" tab. If you have a really good match against someone and want to add them as a friend to play some more, you're out of luck, unless they're on the official Discord or something.
[*]There is a 5-minute timer per turn, per player, for each turn. The problem with this is that if a player is AFK at the very start of the match, everybody else has to wait the full 5 minutes for them to be replaced with a bot.
[*]The ""replay"" feature (which is supposed to save the final board state of a game) seems to also queue you up for another match. Not sure if this is intentional but if it is then it feels poorly communicated.
[*]There's a nasty bug I encountered where, after selecting my cards, food, and bonus card at the start of the game, I was unable to confirm my selections. The button to proceed simply didn't show up. I think it might've had something to do with me exiting the selection view to check the birdfeeder and tray. Anyway, my only option at that point was to leave the match and alt+F4.
[*]You miss out on the tactile fun of playing with physical game pieces. While this is obviously something that can never really be replicated in a digital format, something about the experience feels hollow. I miss stacking the multicolored eggs on your birds and rolling the actual, wooden dice in the model birdfeeder that you have to build yourself.
[/list]

tl;dr The game is fantastic, but this digitial adaptation is not the best way to play it. Buy the physical version and bully your friends or family into playing it with you.

I have noticed quite a learning curve for this game.

The app isn't flawless - I rarely lose to the AI, and there have been glitches (there was a loop the game got stuck in with the Snow Bunting - since patched) and a few other anomalies, but overall, a great app.

The game is beautiful to look at - and to listen to!  The wonderful collection of birds to play adds a level of enjoyment outside/beyond the gameplay itself.

I like all the little details of the birds - would have just loved this for the kids when they were smaller.  As it stands, they all love it as adults, and if we ever have grandchildren, I'm sure they will grow up with this game.  

Takes a little bit of orientation to get the hang of the app even if you have played the game, but once you can find your way around the app, it couldn't be more intuitive or easy-to-use.

My wife isn't much of a (video)gamer, but got herself on STEAM just to get this game, and I'm sure she has logged more time on it than I have.

I will say that I am enjoying this game immensely. I had gotten the board game for Christmas from my boss as she said I could grab anything and I jumped on the idea of having the board game to my collection. To my luck the board game offered a discount code for the game and I went for it. Overall playing with friends and eating snacks has been amazing. Even some of the online play games.

Some of my complaints all go towards the online play as I have been playing for a bit now, one the five minute timer is a tad to long, you should be looking at cards already and strategizing to play. Two the five minute timer runs out and you mostly loose all progress to the game your playing unless you introduce an AI. I'll say that its not all bad and I have learned a lot on how to teach others to play the board game. Just a warning!

While googling for a better deal, I came across the digital version for a third of the price. Well, that was a no-brainer, even though I am notoriously reticent to spend any money on video games ... but I don't count this as a video game, but a board game played on the computer.
And I'm so glad I got it! I love that I can play with people in my family when they feel like it; or against AI; or in online matches. I have a feeling that I learned the game a lot faster than I would have with the physical game, and I know for a fact that I would have hated messing around with that many pieces every time I wanted to play. 
I am not a board game afficionado. I like Clue, Checkers, and Chess; I used to play Stratego when I was younger; and I loathe Monopoly. So I don't have a lot of games to compare this one to. But to me, it feels unique. I quite like that I'm not competing directly against anyone; although I am of course trying to get the most points, I mainly like the strategy side of feeding my birds and laying eggs. I used to be super competitive, but I've mellowed out a lot and I just like playing a good game (maybe that's why I hate Monopoly).
This game most appeals to me, however, just because it's about birds. And I like birds. No, scratch that, I LOVE birds. So a game made up entirely of beautiful bird cards is just my thing. The art on the box at Walmart caught my eye immediately. This game is just beautiful. The music is very nice and calm, the ambience is great, and did I mention the birds?

The physical board game isn't complicated but can be a bit much at the start to figure out, but not with the steam release. the tutorial is good, but even just having the game tell you whether or not you can perform certain actions helps you learn the rules naturally without having to refer to a booklet.

initially i'd held back from recommending the game because the performance isn't as ideal and it was better to wait until some hotfixes were applied. since then it had undergone some patches and the game's running a LOT more better now, not to mention the AI players are getting more nuanced in their strategies. so check the game out!

Low and behold, my first few games went splendid. Then I started running into people either disconnecting or leaving games. This is especially painful when I invest anywhere from 30 min - 1hr and then it all goes to waste. I see that they have a karma system, but it doesn't seem like it's a functional system. Either they start you off at 50/100 karma or something is glitched. There's no reason a newish player should be paired with karma that is already considered low. In addition, there is basically no penalty for being toxic and ditching games. Losing -5 karma points means essentially nothing. Toxic players will continue to abuse this system and leave once they feel like things aren't going their way. I understand disconnecting because of connection issues, but it is obvious when players rage quit. There needs to be stiffer penalties and a way to report players. Toxic players will kill your game. This is true for any game, and unless the developers care to implement something to quash toxicity, I recommend avoiding buying this game if you're mostly interested in random matchmaking. If you're going to play with friends, sure, whatever, buy it. On a side note, there should be a better method of managing cards in hand like viewing the cards in a separate window and being able to sort via different categories. When I draw too many cards, it can be difficult to sift through.",1674746244,1674746244,False,1,0,0.485343009233474731,0,True,False,False

To the Wingspan tabletop board game enthusiasts, it's an extremely faithful adaptation that not only maintains each of the mechanics that make the game so addictive, but imbues each of them with a new set of animations and sounds that allows them to become even more immersive. 

To the casual Steam gamer who's looking to try a popular product on for size, the game offers a mesmerizing landscape of sights, sounds, and extremely fitting pastel artwork that make the modest price seem well worth it. 

Upon adding Wingspan to their library, one could find many reasons to crack it open, including trying out a new strategy that they may have picked up from a friend, learning a bit more about birds through the game's highly visual and auditory mediums, or simply kicking back and enjoying a relaxing experience after a stressful day. Much like the actual board game, Wingspan on Steam does not feel adversarial in nature, whether playing against humans or the AI. That being said, paying attention to the right details of an opponent's game pays the same dividends as in the tabletop game.

Along with all of its (many, MANY) positives, I would point out a few nitpicks, none of which affect the core mechanics of the game, but are still worth pointing out nonetheless: 

- In regards to the tutorial, there is a wonderfully animated one in the game, that does spell most of the mechanics in layman's terms. For a game that I would describe as ""medium"" complexity, there were a few moments during the tutorial where I wasn't clear on what was being discussed (or why). As someone new to Wingspan as a whole at the time, it was not altogether clear to me why eggs for one bird had to be laid in the nest of another, for instance, and it might have behooved the game to drive things like this home a little bit more. Additionally, in the event someone felt comfortable with most of the tutorial but wanted to review one part, they had to rewatch the ENTIRE thing, which was quite long. An encyclopedia, like those featured in other strategy games, would prove highly useful. At the very least, chapters of the tutorial would be much appreciated. 

- In the event of the ""Automata"", which represent a unique version of AI that can play against a single human player (separate from the AI used in the event a player truly wants to play ""single-player"" against the game), there are no instructions received. I'm not sure if there are instructions for something similar in the tabletop version of this game, but the lack of instructions for this included feature (which, as a software engineer myself, I'm sure wasn't easy to code), has acted as a deterrent to my using it much. 

- As a final note, I would say that in the game play itself, there are occasions where a user is performing some fairly complex action (they might be laying an egg on one of their birds as a bonus, for example), and if they happen to click away at that moment unintentionally, are not given much context for what they are supposed to be doing and why. While this may sound like the king of all nitpicks (and, to be fair, in some ways it is), the game presents many situations where there are random egg-laying (or food-collecting) events (perhaps due to the cards that have been played by their opponents), and getting caught in these uninformative loops can feel like a hellish form of purgatory. Maybe a banner clearly articulating the current state of play could work well to reduce any confusion around these events. 

Besides these notes (which really are nitpicks), I have to say that this is a near-perfect game. I give it a 9.5/10. Honestly, if you're a perfectionist, just count it as a 10. It's an amazing piece of both artwork and gaming for a very modest price, and I think you're cheating yourself if you consider not buying it for that missing 0.5. 

Elizabeth Hargrave, thank you so much for your contribution to gaming with this beautiful concept. Both Monster Couch and Stonemeier, thank you for bringing this game to a variety of mediums.

I'm still in the process of learning how to play well, but once you get the hang of it, it's very addictive!!  Also, all the bird sounds are recorded from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, NY, which means they are real bird sounds. (If you've never been to the Lab of Ornithology, but love birds, I recommend an in-person visit to the lab, as there is a really cool mural painted by Ink Dwell, for those impressed with hyper-realistic drawings.) 

In addition to the lovely artwork, there is bird trivia provided which just tickles the brains. You'll be stuck wondering how a bird can possibly carry that many acorns at one time!  My future hopes are for an expansion pack to include South American, Asian and/or Australian birds. 

One hiccup that I noticed was the online multi-player doesn't seem to work well. It's definitely buggy and if you leave to go to the main menu, you sometimes can't re-enter and you end up losing your turn, and when this happens you get booted off and given 'bad karma'.  After Covid, who needs bad anything.  I don't like the design of handing out bad karma for buggy software. I think they should reconsider this. 

This is the game you never knew you wanted or needed until now!  I can't recommend it enough, minus the hiccups.

Why do I like it? For one thing, it's about wild birds and their habitats, so I am a fan of raising awareness about our environmental allies. The art is beautiful and I appreciate that they include naturalist information and history of ornithologists, and even the sounds of the bird calls (if you navigate to the right menu). Next, the game is a great balance of simple and complicated. There are various strategies to win and often it comes down to who exploits the random cards best. Finally, it manages to be challenging! I definitely prefer the AI over the Automaton, for fairness, and human players are great but I have had some issues where an online game was ruined by someone disconnecting, and it would be better to replace the disconnected player with an AI player, in my opinion. I also enjoy that the devs are continuing to produce content.

I was introduced to WingSpan as a boardgame by some friends and loved it. The boardgame had already been recommended to me by several friends, and I thought it looked fun. I was a little worried it would be the kind game you got bored of quickly, I mean I love birds, but how much gameplay can you get out of them. A lot it turns out, there are several different ways to earn points, and the game is ridiculously well-balanced to make sure you need to pay attention to everything, not just pick a pet strategy that’ll always work. Replayability is genuinely fantastic as bonus cards and goals in the game change every time you play. While there are a lot of rules to explain at the beginning of the game, once you start playing it quickly makes sense, and I regularly play games where complete beginners win, so really good complicated-ness balance.

 I was a little bit wary of buying a boardgame as a computer game, but as I am currently in a bit of a transitory period of my life, figured the computer version was more portable, cheaper, with the added benefit of being able to play solo against the AI. I definitely haven’t regretted it! Works exactly the same as the boardgame, this is currently a firm favourite among myself and my siblings when we have a moment and we want to play a game together. Also fun to play solo, I recently did so while bored in an airport. I will say that I think the game takes a little bit longer because you can’t see your own board/cards while others have their turn, so you can’t sit and mull over your options during other peoples turns the way you can in an actual boardgames, but that’s a minor detail. This really only gets annoying when you’re playing multiple people, especially if some of them are the kind of people who deliberate over their turn for ages (like my brother). Typically we play 2-3 people which works great, I’ve played it once with 4 people which did take a while, but to be fair two of them were new to the game so getting the hang of it.

- I am missing the opportunity to get a proper overview of the actual boards of all players that gives me meaningful information - as you would be able to if you sat on a table with others.

- Therefore I think the implenation of the actual boards without scrolling might be useful

- The online matches are not that much fun

- The archive scores should highlight who the player actually was

It's a very relaxing, beautiful card game. I am currently working on my min/max strategies! I've only really played against AI but it's a great way to learn as you can see how the AI that wins has played their turns. The tutorial is actually very helpful also.

I think my only tiny complaint is not being able to see what turns I've previously taken, whereas you can when playing the board game (unless I'm missing something in the UI???) - because I often forget and there's some bonus cards that rely on you performing all 4 tasks in 1 round...

It has a great strategic variety - every game really is different because your strategic objectives are different for every game, and there are a wide variety of potential objectives (of which you try to meet AT LEAST five during each game, and possibly more).  But the truly outstanding thing about this game is that it is...well, sort of non-competitive.  Yes, you're still trying to beat the other people you're playing against, but you're doing so by playing your own game.  It is fairly rare for someone to negatively impact another player (though positive impacts are fairly frequent, which adds another aspect of strategy), and that makes the game truly enjoyable, ESPECIALLY for those of you (and you know who you are) who might not be the ""best losers"".  You have only yourself and a little bit of luck to blame.  So if you're looking for a ""competitive-but-not-fighting-against-others"" style of game, this one is a perfect choice.

Now, there are a couple of things that I think could stand with some improvement.  For one thing, the tutorial is not very good.  As has become a common theme among games, the tutorial REALLY DOES NOT explain the game very well.  And finding any good user guides for it is equally frustrating.  I had to resort to buying the board game itself in order to find a good set of rules for it.  Now, don't get me wrong - the rules really aren't overly complicated...once you understand them.  But the tutorial does not aid in that understanding very well at all.  This game really needs a good tutorial for people to be able to understand everything that's going on.

My one other complaint is that if I want to play against live people online (which you can), I am limited to only two others plus myself.  Whereas if I create a game in a hotseat variety or against the VERY CAPABLE AI then I can have five players.  I would really like to see the online option move up to five players as well.

I have not tried the online play features, so I cannot comment on how well that works, just the AI, Automa, and playing with people who are physically with me.

My biggest gripe about the game is how slow the AI takes it turns. It goes as slow as if you were playing with experienced real players instead of shaving time off of the game. Other than that, the UI could use a little more customization to make the games less frustrating to see what other players are doing.

The game did a good job of introducing me to the rules of the game.  I found the tutorial easy to follow and understand, though it took a game or two for it to all come together in my head having never played a tableau game before.  As a game, Wingspan is a lot of fun.  It ends up being simple in concept in many ways, while also having rather deep and layered strategy.  Learning to improve my play has been an enjoyable challenge.  But that challenge is low pressure as the game manages to be a rather chill, relaxing game (especially in its digital form).  Games aren't really that long, which makes them easier to get into since you know you won't be committing to a long play session (though it is digital and you can pause at anytime and come back).  I will admit that I almost passed on the game at first, thinking it seemed odd to play a game about birds, but I am glad I overcame that.

As a digital adaptation, the game is stunning and beautiful.  The presentation & music provides a soothing atmosphere that matches the feel and aesthetic of the game. I love the animated birds, and the bird sounds, and the fact that there is a voice (optional) providing a brief bit of info on the birds when you encounter them for the first time.

I will also say I encountered no issues while playing it.  So all in all, this is a beautiful game, a beautiful digital adaptation, and a game I can't recommend highly enough.",1669750031,1669750031,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- ""Online error -64"". I get errors sometimes, but I have no idea what it is OR how to fix it, since it doesn't tell me the details. 

- There isn't an indicator for the hand size of other players (unless a specific DLC end of round goal shows up).

- Keyboard shortcuts cannot be rebound in-game. Also there isn't a keyboard shortcut for scrolling through other player's boards. 

- The ""A"" controller button shows up on my cards, despite not having a controller plugged in. 

- If the host starts a lobby and invites other players, and the other players accept the invitation, they skip the lobby and immediately start the game. [i] However the host remains in lobby and has no idea if the other players accepted the invitations [/i] (the other players' portraits don't even change from the question mark logo).

- At the start of a game, player's pick their cards in sequence instead of simultaneously (unlike real life). It's an unnecessary waste of time. 

- There isn't an option to remove individual cards from the deck in custom games (only entire expansions). When playing with friends, it's not fun when someone gets really overpowered cards, while someone else gets really weak cards. Therefore having the option to change the deck would be nice.

- The card size cannot be changed in the in-game encyclopedia. The current size makes sense for mobile but it's too big for PC.

I'm a fan of this online version of the game as it is set-up free and launches you quickly into the game.
The goal of the game is to build a preserve made up of three different habitats with different abilities to perform in each. Forest, you gather food to attract birds. Grasslands, you lay eggs to place more birds. Wetlands, you draw birds to place in your reserve. The tutorial does a good job laying the basics, but I found that playing it myself helped me grasp it better.
Each bird has their own types of powers that can combo in the environments they are placed in and can further combo with other birds. You compete with other players to try and have the preserve with the most points, this can stem from not only birds, but from other mechanics of the game as well like tucking or caching food items on bird cards.
I've only touched the local mode, not online yet, but feel satisfied with the game regardless. A good grab if its on sale.

There are a couple of problems i have with the game, all concerning online play. 
Firstly there is only one game mode, that being 3 player games. I think the game would benefit from changing format every once in a while (like every week, two weeks, month or whatever).
My second problem is that I found that willingness to finish losing games by other players is low. I think I had one player drop out every second game on average. Thanks to that you will sometimes play several hours and not have a finished game (and your karma won't improve either). 
My last problem is that players have 5 whole minutes to make their move and thanks to that games can drag on for very long, especially when one losing player decides that they will use their whole 5 minutes every single turn, resulting in them using (8+7+6+5)x5 minutes of both his opponents' time.

Cheerful chirping and shrill whistles, muffled hooting and sharp quacking, melodious roulades and fascinating trills, in a word, all the sounds made by birds combined with a charming melody  create  in that game  a special atmosphere of peace and relax (for which I am especially grateful to the developers), similar to the one that remains after the reading of Henry Thoreau's writings (actually, playing in Wingspan really made me want to re-read 'Walden or Life in the Woods').
In General, if you like birds and good tabletop games, if you want to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city and feel at the edge of a picturesque forest in North America, then you will definitely like Wingspan!",1600380130,1669194687,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are plenty of videos out there showcasing what Wingspan is. I recommend you check them out. I will spare everyone the details here and focus more on my own pros/cons. You can check out my YouTube Channel, Wingsplain Gaming: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqDe5MF-QfcMEd4pBSoCGtg

The big pros of the digital version for me:
-It eliminates all of the set up and tear down of the physical version. My wife only wants to play digitally now for this reason alone.
-It runs the Automa. I've tried playing solo with the Automa in the physical version and its a pain that I don't like dealing with. 
-It allows me to play with people all over the world and I have found many great players through the Wingspan Tournament Discord: https://discord.gg/GHpNFr9KuP 
I highly recommend joining this community if you wan't to face serious players who won't disrespect your time. Facing random players through online matchmaking will often result in people taking painfully long turns and just timing out in general. 


The Cons of the digital version for me:
-The AI is lacking. I feel like the Hard AI does worse than the normal AI while managing to take longer turns on top of it. Granted, Hard AI is currently listed as ""Beta"" so they are still working on it. Hopefully it improves. 
-You can't see your starting hand until all players ahead of you have chosen their starting hand. This is highly aggravating, especially if you're going last. If I could see my starting hand this would eliminate a lot of the annoyance of waiting for everyone else. 
-The big pop up notifications for your opponent's bird powers and the notification telling you its your turn can get highly aggravating when you're trying to look at your opponent's board, the end of round goals, or are otherwise concentrating on something specific. They interrupt whatever you are doing. I'm not sure there is a good way to address this. Maybe this is a nit pick. Perhaps holding notifications in a queue until you go back to your own board would be a good solution.
-No in game way of communicating with your opponents can get annoying. 
-They've released several very well done and beautiful backgrounds themed around holidays. Why are these only temporary? People have put the work into making these great pieces of art and we really have to wait an entire year to seem them again? It doesn't make much sense to me. 
UPDATE 10/24/22: All of the seasonal/special backgrounds as well as extra avatars are available through a DLC pack. Normally I'm not a fan of this type of thing but I really enjoy Wingspan, I've gotten several hundred hours of enjoyment out of this game, and I want to support Monster Couch, so I purchased it. One nice thing about this DLC is that when they create a new background, it is immediately available to people who have already purchased the background pack, so it has been increasing in value over time. Big thumbs up to Monster Couch for this practice.
-Physical Wingspan currently has two expansions. Its kind of hard coming back to the digital version knowing that it is the core game only. I don't play the digital version nearly as often anymore because of this. The Oceania expansion has done a lot to change the game in a positive way and I prefer playing with that rule set. This is probably another nit pick. I know it takes work to adapt these games and I appreciate everything that Monster Couch is doing to bring the expansions to Steam.
UPDATE 10/24/22: The European Expansion released last spring and it has added a breath of fresh air to the game. Monster Couch has also confirmed that they are working on the Oceania Expansion and Stonemaier Games (Wingspan physical publisher) has eluded to the prospect that the Asia Expansion will be on deck as well. 
-The achievement ""A Real Know-It-Owl"" requires that you play every card in the game at least once. There is currently no in game way to know what birds you have/haven't played before. This can be pretty annoying if you care about the achievement. 
-UPDATE 10/31/22: I was a part of the European Expansion Beta and it played perfectly to my eyes. Once it was released however, it was riddled with game breaking bugs. It baffles me as to how this happened. To Monster Couch's credit, they have stayed on top of these issues and have been (slowly but surely) fixing them over the last several months. Some issues still exist but the expansion is much better than it was on release. It is my hope that the Oceania Expansion launches with much fewer bugs although I am worried since it changes the game in more fundamental ways than EE did. Time has proven one thing: Monster Couch is dedicated to maintaining this game and fixing any issues it may have. I have a lot of respect for this practice. 

Conclusion:
This is a great adaptation of Wingspan and I highly recommend it to anyone. I've put a lot of hours into it and I look forward to many more. I look forward to the expansions.

If you like complex modern board games - i.e. those that can't add gameplay depth without piling layers of complexity - then it might be for you.

The play mechanics are great and make both the board/card version and this computer game version super fun.
The artwork in this game is one of the great pluses of it. The animations of the birds in this digital version are a nice addition, as are the sounds/calls that they make. The music is nice for the way the game is played. It is both super fun to play and educational as you get to know a lot of birds the more you play it. You start to recognize them when they pop up again and again. The descriptions of the birds are true to life and their characteristics in the game mimic what they are like in real life. The digital version of this game is almost identical to the card/board game original. The main difference is that it is harder to keep track of your whole board and especially the boards of the opponents in this digital version, as you have to switch between many screens to see everything, whereas with the boards you can see all in an instant. Despite that limitation, which is pretty much impossible to work around in a computer game format, the game play is great. The AI opponents on regular are relatively easy to defeat if you are good at the game - I come at this after having the board game for almost a year and playing it on a very regular basis in our family, where my wife and kids regularly beat me. 
Right now the board game version is our favorite game to play and I just got this steam-based version this week and can't stop playing it either. It is a great game play.",1663225767,1663225767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Art and ambiance (soundtrack, sound effects) are adequate to great.
-Relatively relaxing game
-Cross play (a touted feature across the platforms)
-games are far quicker to play than with the physical copy, at least in my experience.

Cons:
This is more subjective, but I balk at the 2x price when compared to, for example, the Google Play version.  Both Steam and Google take a 30% cut, though Google started only taking 15% on the first million (USD?).  This is not to mention the DLC. It appears as though the game is the same or a port regardless of platform with minimal adjustment, so I'm a bit miffed at the $20 base price on Steam vs. the $10 base price on Google Play.  Considering its limited complexity, I would call $10 to be about the right price (not on sale) on Steam. 

Based on the game alone, the game is faithful to the physical version and has the functionalities you should expect from a digital version of a board game with minimum fuss.",1662792808,1662805510,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can do -most- things with just the kb, but a few core things like ""tabbing to select my food"" just isn't possible. I also wish they used action cubes in a more visual way. I'd like to see the physical cubes on the screen and click on them to use them. Seeing them transfer from the habitat to the ""when activated"" powers would help confirm some core mechanics of the game. We do get to see them briefly between rounds, which is helpful, but it's brief. I truly think that hiding how action cubes are flowing make the game much harder to grok. I honestly had trouble understanding this game until I played the physical game-board first and then it started clicking. Then coming back to the software I realized it would be ideal if the virtual game had more of the physical elements.

I know I am partially being picky, but it's only because I love this game. There are a few other small things that would be nice to haves, but I think if the game studio improved the above items this virtual version would be a 10/10.

The birds are slightly animated, displaying their own unique call when clicked. The blend between game mechanics and real-life facts is amazingly balanced.

And there are so many ways to play the game and win, there's plenty of room to grow and learn.

As a game, the experience is relaxing and interesting at the same time.

I also found myself learning a lot and enjoying getting to know how the features of the birds in the game correlated to their real life characteristics.

The animations, sound effects and soundtracks are beautiful and one of the perks of playing the digital version (having said that, the physical board game also has its own charms, which I could talk for ages on). It's also allowed me to experience the European Expansion when playing against other players online, which incorporates new interactions/point-scoring mechanisms, and helpful for me or anyone who's interested in buying the real life expansions but not sure if it's worth the money.

This online version is great way to play the game when you can't convince members of your household to play the physical board-game with you... maybe you've asked your partner to play it too many times, and now your pleas to play are thrown aside quicker than your nearest and dearest can say, well, ""no""! (A hypothetical story, of course... ahem...)

This digital version of Wingspan displays the beautiful artwork from the original game and then offers even more artistic wonder with the additional backgrounds you can choose to personalise your virtual playing mat. The benefit of playing the game online also includes special effects not easily provided with a physical board game. You will hear your birds sing or chirp as you make certain moves, which are far more pleasing to the ear than the sound effects I enjoy providing when playing this game with friends on a board game night... 

There were some little glitches with the digital game when it first came out, but the game developers were, and continue to be, very quick to update and iron-out issues. Cheating and human error is impossible, which is also pleasing to me when I know I've lost for good reason.

The online version has also helped me understand some rules that I'd not got quite right when playing the original board game. I am now an even greater pedant for the rules than before...

If you right click, it flips the card for you to read trivia on the bird.  The tutorial is just OK.  I would recommend watching a Youtube tutorial of how to play the board game first (if you've never played before).  Music is relaxing.

Our first 4-person game (3 novices + 1 experienced) took 4 hours to complete. Expect 1 hr per person if it's your first game. Played on TV with controllers.

The one-PC couch experience is a lot more time-consuming than any other mode, including playing the physical version, as there can only be one screen showing one player's board at a time. Other players are basically sitting around waiting, with most of their attention returning when its their turn. This means longer turn times when people mostly plan and act on their game during their turn, while in other modes and formats you are free to explore any time.

The game otherwise is great. The digital version is good for learning the rules as a number of descriptions can be ambiguous. If you want to increase tempo it's better to get the physical version, also more engaging and much better view of the whole situation.",1659946304,1659946304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PERFORMANCE:
Runs very well, no complaints
here's my specs: 

Windows OS
Intel Core i5-9300H
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 (4 GB VRAM)
8 GB RAM


GAMEPLAY: 
Reasonably easy to get into, though a little jarring if you only played the board game version in my experience.
Should probably take 1-2 matches to get the UI and rules/mechanics of the game. In this time you can probably also figure out basics of how cards combine together with their abilities.

Building a strategy with the cards is very fun, planning ahead and seeing how everything falls in its place can be very satisfying. And victories feel earned because honestly the AI is pretty good on normal and hard.
 
You can also look at the bird cards in the main menu, to see what they all do, though I believe this only works with the ones you've already played or seen. You can kinda plan ahead and see what kinds of bird combinations you can make this way.
Multiplayer:
online with strangers is an option, however you are only able to play with up to 3 players at a time, you can be in several wingspan online games though it seems, having the option between games taking 5 minutes per turn or up to several days per turn. I however do not know how alive the online community is with strangers.

You can also play this with your buddies, up to 5 players at once can play if you invite your friends, couch coop is also an option.

The only thing I wish we had was more in depth ways to customize game experience with different game rules and such, it would've given so much more extra ways to play the game. 


DLC:
European DLC works very well in my experience, it also adds more variety to the cards to mix up the game and you can turn off the base game cards to play with just the DLC cards it seems. 
Personally I think the EU DLC is worth it, especially on sale I think its a must grab

Any other DLC is up to you, since its kinda just cosmetics and the soundtrack, they're nice but ultimately I don't think they're worth your money unless you really really want to support the game and really really love it.
I guess if they're on sale its nice to grab them too.


All in all I have no real complaints with the game and think it lives up to the standards and experience of the board game quite nicely, though I'd still prefer the boardgame myself. I hope others enjoy it as much too.
I will probably instantly buy more DLC for more birds and such if any comes out.

The tutorial is really bad.  In the tutorial the ""guide-lady"" (named Robin) explains the concepts, while making loud pencil scrawling sounds.  She then proceeds to freeze the board whenever she is talking, and only after she has finished talking and you have clicked her enough times will she allow you to click on the normal UI to do what she was trying to explain.  In other words, she gets in your way.  The descriptions of the rules are fairly verbose and tedious.

Having learned Race for the Galaxy first, I was spoiled in that game by the very compact (somewhat cryptic) rule descriptions on the cards, which is missing here, so in Wingspan you have to take extra time to read the verbose descriptions.  It's not horrible, but it could be better.

This software version of the game may be my only hope at learning how to play the boardgame though - so this game is not bad - it's just... barely good.  The rules seem overwhelming at the start too - there are layers of complexity such that the tutorial left my head spinning (but that was mostly a result of the tutorial's very bad UI - which at least is limited only to the tutorial and not part of the regular gameplay).  It wasn't until I played without the tutorial ""helper"" getting in the way, that I started to feel a bit of the game ""flow"".  The flow isn't bad.

PROS:
+ The bird sounds are very nice.  I like being reminded what a red-winged black bird sounds like as it is such a familiar sound.  I think playing this game - especially because it is software and NOT the boardgame - will raise my awareness and ability to identify birds in the field by their songs.

+ In normal gameplay the game seems to guide the player what options they have available fairly well.

CONS:
- The game mechanism is a bit contrived so it doesn't help with immersion.

- Tutorial is horrible

- There are multiple responsibilities for game locations.  For example, a field is a place to lay eggs, but it's also the habitat for certain birds to build their nests.  So by making a location both a habitat and a function for laying eggs, it adds confusion.  That was just an example - all 3 habitats (forest, field, lake) also double up as function (forest=obtain food which includes mice and fish, field=lay eggs for any bird which may be in a different habitat, and lake=get new bird cards).  This is a bad design, but it lowers the amount of cardboard required when printing the board game - so the player eats the publishing costs by sacrificing a good design for a cheaper one.

Generally though - I can see enjoying playing this if I get a few more hours of gameplay at least to the point of being a competent player - and I think the chance to practice will be helpful if I ever get to play the boardgame version with friends.",1656956439,1656956439,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

I spent $60 to buy the game and expansion for all three of us and after attempting one game online with them, it was already rough enough for me to rate this.

Four reasons:
[h3]Online connection issues[/h3]
Connecting is terribly confusing, as a """"host"""" is put in the lobby, to invite others, but they are thrown directly into game without any indication to the host that someone has actually arrived, or the player that the game is starting for that matter. If an invite is declined, it cannot be resent to that player, and that seat remains wasted. For some inconceivable reason, resolving your starting hand is done [i]sequentially[/i], in turn order, and absolutely nothing shows on your screen if it's not your turn. Further, neither your name nor player portrait show up on anyone else's screen until after you have selected cards. Makes it great to figure this out live with my older family members! The entire time we constantly thought things weren't working right.

[h3]Games take f o r e v e r[/h3]
Most digital implementations of board games [i]speed up[/i] play. For singleplayer, this is perhaps true, but definitely not so for multiplayer. My family and I are very familiar with this game and its expansions, we'd knock out a game in person in maybe 90 minutes or so. Our first 3 player game took us 2 hrs to get through the first 2 rounds of the game. [b]So much[/b] of this is because absolutely nothing is simultaneous to the point of it being absurd. You're forced to pick your starting hand [i]individually[/i]! Simple things like discarding cards at the end of your turn or listening to the bird-facts (which are only heard by one player at a time) prevent turns from moving on. Turns cannot be planned in advance, even for things that could not be interrupted.

[h3]There is zero interactivity with the other players[/h3]
Long play time sucks, especially with the long amounts of downtime it causes, sure. However, from your perspective, during the agonizingly long time it is not your turn, absolutely [i]nothing[/i] is happening. You CANNOT plan your turn, it doesn't even show you what your opponents are doing, they have no presence. You can check what they [i]did[/i], but you can't see what they're doing as it happens. This makes the game feel [b]isolating[/b] and like you're playing alone.

[h3]Custom games are not saved locally and time out[/h3]
Because of the incredibly long times, we decided to save our first game and come back to it another day. You cannot do this. All online games, no matter context, are designed to be played popping in and out, play by mail style. You're encouraged to have many going at once, which is probably why the developers made no effort to streamline the individual games. All this means you can't stop the turn timer, which gives 3 days for each turn. My family and I only have weekends available which means no saving games for us! Thanks!

All of these issues [i]could[/i] technically be fixed, but I don't imagine that happening quickly, if at all. It's clear that multiplayer for this game was designed with matchmaking and leaderboards first and foremost, which for a game like this is a bit like missing the forest for the trees if you ask me.",1656543840,1656544009,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The digital version plays pretty well, and if you appreciate the single player experience, it will do just fine. The AI feels relatively competitive from what I have experienced.

As for the feel of the game, the way the birds move on the cards and the sound effects you hear throughout are really well-done. Everything is just lovely to look at (including the board background options - with new ones seemingly released every so often).

The music is beautiful, and the soundtrack is absolutely worth it if you are looking for some soothing background music.

If you are open to a mostly single player experience, then I would recommend this game for you. The main reason I cannot recommend the game in its current state is because of the multiplayer experience (that I believe others have commented on enough in the discussion boards). 

1) Being limited to 3-player matches is frustrating when the physical game can be played with up to five players. I am not clear on what might be preventing the devs from allowing matching for any two to five player game.

2) The timer options are too restrictive. Why are there no options for turn timers between five minutes and 72 hours? This functionality exists in other online asynchronous board games (e.g. Through the Ages) that have been out for longer. I lost 10 karma for games that I started five weeks ago and just got back from a ten day vacation where I did not have access to the game. The game could really benefit from async timer options between 5 minutes and 72 hours.

IMHO, the game could also benefit from a turn log. This is a more minor point. I know you can see what your opponents have done because it briefly pops up by their avatar when you re-enter a game, but if you miss this, you need to click around a bit to see what they have done and what the results are.

Whenever the devs address the 3-player limit on matched games and allow for more async timer options, I would happily change this recommendation to a positive.",1654663460,1654663460,False,40,0,0.739705443382263184,0,True,False,False

I'm sure the game itself is wonderful but the tutorial is truly baffling. The 'guide' restates every statement she makes 5 ways to Friday, even the most basic concepts. It was confusing and I kept forgetting what I was told earlier in the tutorial because I was being told 15 different times how you have to 'pay' a certain type of 'food' to play each 'bird' or whatever.

There was at one point a novel about how a can't-go-back sign means, shockingly enough, that you can't undo that decision so think twice before making it. Fine, I guess maybe some people need that extra hint (once), fair enough. But then she stated this AGAIN not five minutes later!

The game is fairly complex as is, and there is nothing wrong with that... but for listening to the guide repeat herself into circles I didn't learn anything about actually playing it... or what I did learn was promptly forgotten. Concise tutorials please!

Play solo against the CPU, who puts up a good fight, or play online with friends or strangers. There is no way to communicate with the players through the client, which is likely a blessing when against randoms, but you will need discord or other messenger when with friends. 

I do not have the board game, but  - unless one needs the tactile experience - this is clearly the better option. No setup and breakdown required, and scoring is automatic.

Multiplayer Online has many, many issues. Primarily, 100% CPU usage (almost constantly), and severe drops in frame rate which  get progressively worse.

需要很明确四个行动的顺序，甚至在一轮的开始就规划好所有的行动顺序，然后给出变量的空间。能变换位置的鸟是很强的，但也很难用，需要仔细思考。然后也要学会通过看别人的牌判断接下来的行动或者这轮目标是可以赢还是可以追平，如果必输有什么办法补救。如果这些都能做到，每局基本都能平均85分左右，但90分又是一个坎，需要扣的更细，更需要运气的加成。
虽然BGG排名比较高，但我觉得大概是受了疫情宅家的影响，毕竟实体版有精美的设计和出色的卡画，又能让家人坐在一起聊天动脑，勾心斗角的要素相比其他德策也少了很多很多。如果是steam版，喜欢德策的一定不能错过，喜欢鸟的一定不能错过。

But watching someone explaining the game on youtube helps a lot! So suddenly I was winning and I was understanding the mechanics. I also bought the real board game. But I must say I enjoy the digital version the most.

I can play it on my own and I can play it with AI players. I like that the birds are making sound when you click on them. Also some woman is telling me some facts about the birds. I like the sound effects, it is just like outside my house at the feeding and breeding place. Different bird sounds, birds flying up and down. 

I also like the digital version because you do not need to think about what needs to be done now. Sometimes it works not intuitive, but clicking around till you have found the correct way helps. Also the undo button is a real help. Sometimes I really do not understand what the game wants me to do or which action I am doing. English is not my first language, but also the UI itself can be a bit confusing. But mostly I must sit back, relax, concentrate and just do exactly what I am told. After a while I get the hang for it.

I also like you can change the background, but I liked it better when the game itself changes the background randomly instead of going to your picture. 

The game plays very smooth, but it depends on your pc setup ofcourse. I never had a crash or a bug (the software one ;)). I always turn the music off, it is nice, but after a while it is irritating. 

In conclusion: I really like the game. I always want to come back to play it better. And the expansian brings more options and they are different. It feels like there are more options to make the game easier/faster, but you pay a big price for it (ingame I mean). So there is the balance for me. I am mostly playing with 5 players and mostly I am winning now. But trying to change tactics resulted in loosing. Winning from the autonoma is still a bridge to far. It has a lot of replayability.

I play it mostly in the evening after work. i also like to play it in the lunch break if I need to reset my brain. I have no regret bying this, it is a good adaption of the board game. It feels like you are playing the real game. So confusing at the start, but once you are past that, you can have great fun.

When I first saw the description and trailer, I was very impressed with the concept. A relaxing strategy game involving birds and building reserves for them. As a (now graduated) game design student attending a marine focused college, I was curious to see how games involving nature would work out (in addition to my interest in birds).  After my first few games, I honestly fell in love with it. I found myself playing the game either by myself or with friends when I find myself not wanting to play anything that requires more setup time. 

The game being relaxing is an understatement (unless you are one who sees competition in everything). You find yourself thinking about these birds even when you are away from the game. I once visited an animal preserve in Arizona and was immediately able to recognize the majority of birds there. This was due to me playing the game to the point of passively memorizing the birds. 

I highly recommend this game. I am now wearing a shirt with a Lazuli Bunting on it with the captions [b] Bird Nerd [/b] on it. Once you recognize a good portion of the birds of wingspan in real life and are able to tell others about it, I suggest you get a bird shirt or hat as well to commemorate the occasion.

It looks pretty but the UI is a confusing mess of interfaces that transition in and out unecessarily. The time it takes to find what you want, and then to click and use that aspect of the game is too long. A game like this is a succession of the same repeated actions, having any excess interaction because you have to move a cursor carefully, or all the way across the screen, or scroll through multiple different areas, is cumbersome and boring.

I am happy to say that I very much enjoy this rendition of the game.  The mechanics are intuitive, as is the navigation, and everything that's important is easy to spot and access.  The music is lovely, the animations are gorgeous, and the artwork is breathtaking.  The Steam version takes what is normally a pretty thinky and involved engine builder and turns it into a surprisingly relaxing experience.

This version of the game feels quite a bit less competitive than the board game version, both because of the aesthetic presentation and because your screen is dominated by what's going on in your aviary specifically.  You have to go out of your way to be attentive to what's happening in the other players' aviaries, which makes the game feel less cutthroat than it can feel in real life, when other players are actively announcing their turns and drawing your attention to everything they're doing.  In this game, you can choose to focus entirely on your own aviary, only being mindful of other players when their actions directly affect you.  Of course, if you do want to be knowledgeable of what they're doing, it is not hard to do so, and I would recommend doing that often when you're feeling competitive.

I do have a couple of small grievances.  The biggest one is that the game is not very friendly to card hoarding strategies.  The cards in your hand are always fanned out in the bottom left area of the screen, and when you hover over any specific card, it will rise up and give you better visual access to it.  This works well when you have a hand of less than, say, five cards.  But it becomes very unwieldy the more you get.  If you have 9 or 10 cards in your hand, it becomes very difficult to hover over the one card that you want, and only after around 6 cards in your hand will you no longer be able to discern any of your cards from one another without specifically hovering over them.  I would prefer some alternative method of presenting your hand in order to mitigate this problem, perhaps by allowing players to click something near their hand to fan out their cards more, or moving the location of bonus cards to somewhere other than your hand.

I also feel that the online options are a little bit lacking.  There isn't a rating system that us competitive folks might prefer, and there are only two game pacing options: one that limits your turn to five minutes, and one that limits your turn to 3 days.  I would like more variety in the time controls, for example giving players a total of 15 minutes for all of their turns combined.  The fact that there's an option for having each turn last three days is actually a bit weird, as this really does not seem like the sort of game where I would enjoy correspondence.

If you've never played Wingspan before, neither the board game nor the Steam version, my default recommendation would be to get the board game first.  It was designed as a board game first and a computer game second, and you'll probably be able to tell that this is the case if you start out with the steam game.  As long as you have friends to play it with, the board game will give you the more authentic that Wingspan provides.  It has lovely components, and its tabletop experience is one-of-a-kind.  Plus, the board game comes with a coupon for the game, so you can get it at a reduced price.  If you don't have anyone to play with in real life, then I think you'll still enjoy the Steam version of the game.",1651968026,1651968026,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

kinda crazy in a 2 person game to draw into birds that create bonuses(due to RNG of the decks draw), I found 3 early so that was exciting!

i have 4 bonuses to achieve, 9% trait, 15% trait, 18% trait, 31% trait, odds arnt looking good but I like the challenge to complete them all!

through some crazy hunting for specific cards and RNG I end up playing 9 birds, my opp plays 8 birds again 2 person game so getting free draws or resources from all players is limited.

I FINISH ALL 4 BONUSES ACTIVE! +15 POINTS total from reaching each cards objective!

my opponent tucks and eggs dumps all game and beats me by 22 points.

what is the point of trying something so far, so hard for 0 reward, do the math. Should be an overall reward for chaining bonuses +5 for every bonus card you complete so ending with 4 active bonuses (0 for 1, 5 for 2, 10 for 3, 15 for 4) as an option.

or just skip the entire bonus deck and leave it out of the game and tuck and egg drop or cache cause there is 0 point to go for the bonuses compared to playing point birds that give you points based on if you clicked the row or not. 

clicking a row that lets you drop eggs, tuck and cache, so maybe 4+ points a click, compared to me having to find birds that eat ONLY slugs in a 2 person game creating my own draw mechanic fooooooooooor 6 points once. within 2 turns those clicks not only out due my bonus but the turns wasted to find that so specific trait and I achieved 3 separate trait bonuses on top of that. 

my opp. click row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2 row 1, row 2. wow infinite points that was hard!

I generally don't play multiplayer videogames, so I don't have any experience playing against human opposition, but I have played extensively versus the AI.

I like most things about the game.  The visuals and sound effects are well done.  I played the tutorial for the achievement, and I think it does a decent job.  I appreciate the option to play both the normal game with AI players, and against the Automa, which is significantly more challenging than the regular AI if you know the game well.  And the price is very reasonable, especially for someone like me who could easily sink more than fifty hours into it.

I do have a few criticisms.  It's very annoying that there is an achievement to play all of the birds in the game, but no indication that a particular bird is unplayed before you play it.  There is a setting to only read birds' flavor text when played if you have never played it before, but that doesn't help.  There's a gallery of all played birds, but no way to get it to display unplayed birds.  I'm down to needing about five more to complete the registry, and it's getting frustrating.  

My other major criticism is that the hardest AI available are just not all that good at the game.  I win over 95% of the time, and that's considering that I'm sometimes playing sub-optimally to complete achievements.  That said, the AI does reasonably well, sometimes enough to beat me, and often enough getting good scores (85+).  I have seen the AI break 100, albeit rarely, and usually when multiple AIs are handing out free food and cards to all players like candy.

I've never played the Wingspan board game and after playing the digital adaption I have no desire to play it. Although I like the setting (who doesn't like birds) the game play is sadly lacking. Luck plays far to great a role, it is more like Monopoly in this respect than a Euro board game. The range of typical scores is an indication to me that luck is too prevalent - from what I have read and from my experience with the game, scores in the range of 60-90 are typical, which is a very narrow range. Whether you score in the upper section of that band depends mostly on whether you get the cards and food that you need - if you don't you don't stand a chance.

As far as a digital adaption, this game is pretty good. The graphics are great and the interface is pretty slick. There is one issue with the interface though - far too many mouse clicks are required, even when you have are not given any choice. The computer AI seems reasonable, but I'm not great at the game so I'm not sure. After about a dozen games I was able to beat the computer AI at hardest (beta) level in 2 and 4 player games. The computer AI will certainly allow you to learn the game.

I only play single player and the digital adaption has very little to offer for me. It will teach you the game and that is it. There are no challenges similar to the much better ""Through the Ages"". You can save your games to an archive but there are no high score tables - nothing. So once I learned how to play the game reasonably well there is nothing left to do as a single player. No loss though given by that time playing the game lost all its appeal.

I'll recommend the game for multi-player/on-line because it is a good digital adaption of a not very good game.",1648080551,1648943503,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Played a bunch more games online and had fun. Some of my original feelings stand about the core game mechanics, but this is a review for the steam games adaptation to digital. 

There are some flaws in the ui design, a few minor graphical glitches that were annoying for a second, but not game breaking, a limited matchmaking variety and leaver karma system that can turn a relaxing game into disappointment or frustration. 

Overall the game can be really fun, especially if you don't take it too seriously.
 My major grips are that; its just too slow at times, the counter play is too limited, if you get the wrong cards you can't win but you will be playing for an hour, lack of diversity in multiplayer online options / speed mode.

Theres more that irks me, but I would say its a great addition to your steam library. Just know that even though its a 'card game' it plays out much like a 'board game' in terms of both pace and creativity.

As far as gameplay goes, there are probably better comments out there to help describe it in detail, but the gist is that you're playing the cards of birds to try and earn the most points.

Given the enormity of the number of birds with all their various abilities be it ones that activate on play, on habitat activation, or due to something your opponents do the number of combinations are rather great, though not all are created equal (see Chihuahuan Raven as an example of an S tier bird).

The core gameplay loop is an easy to navigate affair. The hud, cards, and actions are labeled and put forth in a very upfront and easy to understand manner that make it hard to misunderstand what is happening. Overall it is a very relaxing and charming game with a lovely art style that can be replayed numerous times with each game offering very diverse possibilities due to the volume of birds at play. Now if only I could get them to make a game similar to this but about all the various fish.

My only miniscule complaint is that the game goes by very quickly without you even realizing it if you don't keep very strict track of the number of turns left. Add in that you can only either activate a habitat or play a single bird(not including birds that let you play an extra bird in the same habitat) and you can finish a game easily in 20 minutes which can also be a good thing for those with not much time to spare. The only thing I'd really change is making it so we could activate 1 habitat AND play 1 bird in a turn, instead of an either or situation but I imagine it was designed that way for balancing or some such.

Pros: REALLY addictive gameplay and a super cool premise. I love strategy and I definitely recommend this game for those who like turn-based card games. The art is pretty and I like the trivia/bird sounds.

I really love the singleplayer in this game and I love playing it while listening to music.

Cons: Multiplayer is painfully slow since each person is given FIVE WHOLE MINUTES to take that turn. When against bots, or even against other people who can play faster, the game shouldn't take as long as it does - but matching up with people makes games drag on for so long that I just would rather leave.

On the single player front, the AI is still in development. Had a game against Hard AI that scored 27 points total. This is almost an impossibly low score. With another Hard AI scoring at it's highest at roughly 70 points. I won the game at roughly 120 points, claiming all the round goals and dominating on eggs and points on cards. I'm not a professional wingspan player, so I was a bit disappointed with the AI. The game takes quite a bit of time to process turns and actions. It feels like playing with human players with that regard, but not really what I'm looking for from a computer game.

The Multiplayer also needs some more development. Currently to play with friends, you need all the players online in the application at the same time for starting a game. We had about 3 or 4 attempts before digging into discussions and finding out how to set up our async game with everyone incorporated. Coming from BGA or Yucata, or even other boardgames on Steam, there's an expectation of being able to send an invite, that another player can engage with on their own time.

The game could also use a listing of player names where the in game avatars are set up. As the avatars are limited, it can be hard to read what other players are doing via these generic avatars. They do have some general description of the action listed, but not shown in much detail. Often I don't know what food is collected, when a player visits a birdfeeder for example, or what bird was picked up from open selection.
 The 72 hours to perform a turn is ok, but really would be more comfortable with either a much longer time frame or a unlimited time frame. If someone in our friend group wanted to take a week off, I think the game could support that, as other boardgames online with async options allow. See Waterdeep, Concordia, etc.

The art is beautiful, and the playing of cards via the UI is excellent. There is some ambigiousness to the board state however, as you really can't at a glance read other player's cards / resources / engine. You can get there via shifting from card descriptions from card symbols to card abilities and then shifting for each individual player, but it's a bit clunky. Would like to see a consolidated option that showed all the card information at once, even if it was just limited to one player at a time. 

I'm not a fan of playing this game on a physics simulator on something like tabletopia, but you do have access to all the information at a glance in those styles of systems. I think a simpler UI option more in the style of spreadsheet would probably enable the same level of playability, by being able to read the game state. A UI button that toggles things from Beautiful, to the more Readable would be appreciated. They have a ""read your personal player board button"" but it doesn't currently list all the card information, and still requires cycling through UI systems.

The boardgame itself is fun, and this seems like a good way to learn that boardgame if you wanted a more interactive tutorial. Might also be fun to play live with friends. Can't comment on playing with randos. The Automata contest seems like a nice buffer for the game until they develop a more challenging AI.

In short, both the singleplayer and the multiplayer versions of this game could use more development for ideal play.",1646824066,1646824066,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You will be working with your deck to build an exotic bird nest while a pleasant soundtrack plays on background and your collection of featherlings sings a harmonic trill. Each bird card contains a short paragraph of this bird's lore or peculiarity. Also, all cards are animated and thus give you some early impression of what type of bird you are looking at, which manners or character it has and so on. You actually will learn several ornithological lessons while playing even if you don't need those. Probably even find your favorite bird, too!

Rules are not very complex. Your main goal is to get as many points as possible in each round, by completing special tasks and by making correct choices with actions of your birds. This game is a nice choice for starters -- who don't usually play board games or haven't played a lot before. If you're a beginner, there is a voiced and animated guide to understand the rules and dive in easily.

Your board and profile can be customized for adding some individualism. Must be important for those who value cosmetic items.

You can play with your friends (there is an up to 4-people multiplayer mode), with bots or with other random players. This can be mixed.
It is also possible to create private lobbies if you don't want to play in matchmaking mode, and play just locally.

For those who seek challenge Wingspan offers them: there is a leaderboard shared among other players and some achievements to try hard for.
For collectors there is a special tab where you can check and reread info about all your unlocked(ever drafted) birds. You can have all the birdy-pedia with lore and animations if you try enough!

As a board game, I give it a 10 out of 10. Friendly, warm game experience and a ton of knowledge all wrapped nicely with its outstanding visuals and sfx.",1646532880,1646532880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The board game version was my first exposure to this game and it is really overwhelming to get into it from there.

Reading the instructions didn't really help too much and so I went to this digital version in hopes to gain a better understanding and it really helped a lot. So if you also are coming here from the board game, I highly recommend picking this up. Just the tutorial alone will help you get under way and you could always take what you've learned to the board game.

I absolutely love the music, the bird song, and the facts that are read when you play a card. This game is LOADED with charm and I can't say enough nice things about it. Give it a chance, it will probably take a few games to get the hang of it... but you eventually start to play out strategies in early rounds that pay off in later rounds. It's wonderful how it gets you thinking and planning. BUT still the luck of the draw can work against you for sure so plenty of pitfalls and gambles you can take.

I'm anxiously waiting the arrival of the European Expansion so completing the available achievements has been a nice challenge in the meantime. 

Some downsides I see to this digital edition is that I don't believe there are any statistics of your games being kept.

Things that would be cool to see is average points, minimum score, maximum score, average birds played, eggs layed, etc. It would be a cool feature to keep track of your progress in terms of strategy!

If I didn't already play this game and know how it works, I would have returned it. As is, I’ve played about 50-60 games against the AIs and Automa (out of sheer stubbornness, I guess), but I think the UI needs to be completely reworked. I cannot in good faith recommend spending full price for the digital version. Again, this is purely because of how they’ve translated the game to a digital format - the game itself is great. Get the physical copy.

I haven't tried playing online/multiplayer because so many people have left negative reviews about it. My review is of solo play against the AI and automa. 

My main issue is with the overall UI. It seems like the focus was purely on making it pretty and not on actual practical playability.

My biggest complaint is that at no point do I have a high level view of my entire board, or anyone else's. I feel like I'm playing half blind at all times. Even the alternate brown card board view doesn't show all the information - I have to click between different views to see the nest / food type or the abilities - that’s a big issue when I’m trying to figure out where to lay eggs as I’m completing actions. It took a couple dozen games to get more comfortable with it, but it’s still really not ideal. It really should have a fully consistent and integrated, level-by-level zoom in and zoom out format, where you can see the full spread of the game from above, and click on your or another person's spread to view it in more detail, and then zoom in or out to a zone. Click in, click out, in a very logical and intuitive way. Or something like that. I basically just don't look at other people's boards because I have enough trouble keeping track of my own. It is not intuitive at all.

The ""pretty"" view is literally unplayable for me, which is why I use the brown board view. Thankfully you can turn off the actual bird animations, but the entire thing is incredibly visually distracting. Why are the cards slightly turned? Why do they bob around? Why can’t I see all my regions at once? Why can I vaguely see stuff in the background? If I keep that view I accidentally play birds into the wrong habitats, and I make all kinds of other mistakes, especially when laying eggs. All three of the other people I know who have tried to play have had similar complaints. I have ADHD and it is literally impossible for me to visually track, and I don't typically have this issue with other digital board game interpretations. 

Other issues:

-Major complaint: I can't organize my hand or re-order it, or even spread it all out if I have a lot of cards - it makes me not want to go for a card drawing strategy. This is a really, really basic thing that I should be able to do. I need to be able to see everything I have, and I can’t strategize at the level I would like without this feature.

-I didn't see a tutorial for playing the automa. I’d never tried it before with the physical copy, and I had to watch a youtube playthrough video to figure out how it worked.

-You’re only shown the opponent’s turn if you’re playing the automa. Versus the AI, you just get a tiny banner below the player icon saying what they did. I think that when playing the AI, it should automatically shift you from player to player so you observe your opponent’s turn and board - do the thing where it gives you a “continue” arrow like it does for the automa. Or at least make it an option you can toggle in the settings. I wind up just not paying attention to what my opponents have going on, which is really not ideal.

-When selecting your initial cards, you can’t be in the brown board view. If you try to click on cards to choose them, it won’t work.

-I wish it would let you restart a solo game at any point you wish, without having to complete it first. I frequently make mistakes right at the beginning because of having to toggle between the regular view and the brown card view, and it’s super irritating.

-The automa’s score counting when it exceeds the limit is a little wonky - for example, if the round goal is ""number of birds in the water"", the automa caps out at 5 for birds in a zone, but then if it gets a minus 1 it can still stay at 5 if it was actually above 5, which I couldn't see; I can’t tell if it reflects the proper automa rules or not; at a minimum, it’s confusing and not transparent.

-There are some minor issues with the rule programming - some inconsistencies, like when it warns you before skipping an action. Sometimes it warns you when you can’t actually complete the action - usually it just lets you click through, so it’s jarring to be warned I’m missing something when I’m not, and have to go double check. I’ve also had the “spend eggs” action freeze on me several times in specific odd circumstances - so far I’ve been able to click around and get it unstuck, but there’s been at least one instance where I had to skip an action I wanted to take because of a bug.

-The beta ""hard"" AI setting is very slow, for playing against the AIs in a normal style game. It takes quite a long time for the AI to ""think"" and choose an action.

-I know I’ve had other quibbles that I’ve just gotten used to after playing dozens of times and memorizing the cards. In general, I think there’s a lot that needs work/reworking. 

In terms of what goes well:

-I like that it keeps score for you? That makes it easier.
-The turn counter is nice. It’s a little visually busy, but it does keep me on track.
-The music is very pleasant and soothing
-The narrator’s bird facts are cute, and IIRC if you don’t like them, you can turn them off.
-I like playing the automa best; while playing against the AIs is fine, it’s not difficult to beat, and I feel more challenged by the automa.

To be specific, the public games have issues but if you are playing with a private game it works fine.
I have played the board game and enjoy it and the actual game play of the electronic version is the same and very enjoyable, however the online play has issues for me, as follows:

There is no chat in the online game.  While this is nice in that you don't get trolls and baiting, the problem is that when a problem occurs with the game you can't find out if it is the player or the game.

If someone leaves an online game it becomes a local game with the other players replaced with AI.  

The timers do not appear to work correctly.  this may not be the case, it may be that players have left or that they got in trouble with the game interface and exceeded their time, but either way when the player times out so does the game.

The selection system for online players is opaque.  You get on hoping someone will join but you do not know how many people are actually online so it could be a long time or it may be short.

There does not appear to be a way to set the time for a game so you are stuck with 5 minutes a move.

If you like the board game and the only reason you are going to buy it is to play the computer, or friends you know, buy it, it is a good game in that regard, although I can't speak to how good the AI is, but if you want to play online with anyone on the web wait until they fix it.",1601846949,1645580231,False,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is great, art/theme is fantastic, if you like engine builders you'll love this. The move to digital seems to have brought across all the features of the physical game.

My one complaint is that the UI feels pretty clunky - I wish I could just see the whole board at once and hover over cards to make them bigger, instead I have to navigate a lot and never really have a complete view of whats going on. 

It seems like it was designed specifically for navigating with a pad - so if you plan on sitting on the couch with an xbox controller it will probably feel more natural than most digital board games do. 

But if you play with a mouse and keyboard it's probably going to feel like everything takes more clicks/button presses to do than it should, and there's nowhere to get a view of the whole game board at once.",1644473801,1644473945,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mutilplayer with random is bad and annoying :

-***Lack of ranking system***
I'm sure everybody would like to play against other players that understand the game on the same level.

-***The karma system is terrible***
Once you miss a few games for technical issues you drop 5 points. You gain 1 point if all 3 players finishes the game. When you are below 30 karma points you get a lot of random that just quit the game midway and nobody gets any karma point this way. Its frustrating after playing for an hour to get nothing in the end.
Ideas : If people leave the others get some points anyway for playing. And more points per goal done during the game. More karma for the winner, etc..

-***Turns are way too long***
They provide 5min per turn for each player to play their turns. It doesnt sound that bad when you play your first few games but when you start understanding the game a lot more and you have to wait sometimes 5-10min before you can do your turn its hell.
Ideas : Do another ''Real-time'' with only 2min per turn or even 1min per turn would be anough for a lot of people.

I know it might not be the idea of the game when you released it to become an online PvP based game but i beleive you could make this game addictive with just a few adjustments.

While you don't explicitly interact with other player's boards a lot it's a very cooperative game in that everyone I'm with is always sharing tips and suggestions on what's the best action for them to take. Something I love is that while the objective of the game is to win via the most points I don't even view it as winning that game but rather I'm always trying to beat my previous scores and be even more efficient with how I play.

Success relies on accumulating the right mix of cards that generate the special powers of the birds, as well as the  points you score from the birds alone.

There's not much interaction between players other than competition to be the best of whatever the challenge is for that round (a round being 5-8 turns long).  
The challenge is to build a bit of an engine and to be efficient with your actions so as to maximise your rewards.  So it's quite thinky and requires a bit of planning your moves. 
There's no popping off with a player laying down one card and smiling smugly mas everyone else realises they've probably just won the game - like you sometimes get in Terra-forming Mars for example.  It's more gaining ground by small increments.  
This has an up and a down side.  The up side is that usually it's hard to know who is winning and everyone feels like they have a chance right up to the end.  The down side is that in the odd occasion where you get off to a bad start as you don't get the sort of cards you need in the early game, then it's hard to find a play that will make up the lost ground.  
I like the way the food resource works, as what you want is not always there and there is a bit of randomness in it when the supply is renewed.  This means you can't plan ahead too much, or should I say you have to balance playing out your perfect set of moves for maximum game end points with risking the resource you want being taken away.  Maybe you get to replenish the supply but an unlucky roll might mean the fish you needed and didn't take are gone and now you are looking at a set of 5 maggots!!
The shop of new birds has three face up cards to take from or else a blind draw.  If the perfect bird comes up is the shop, do you risk leaving it or do you make a slightly less efficient play to guarantee you get that Fox Eared Barn Owl??!!
I think they've done very well with the number of turns you get throughout the game as a whole.  There always seems to be enough time to get done what you wanted to achieve but without any time for your strategy to go over-ripe and fade away.  
In summary a pleasant mid weight euro style game, which doesn't take long to learn and which offers plenty of challenge.

Though already getting late, I knew I should only play against the computer, knowing MP would take a little too long, I played 4 games against the AI, (not expecting to play that many).. the next night same thing. everyone helps cleans the table up from the many game pieces, and disperses into their rooms. I again, wanting more, jump on to the computer and  ready myself for a game of MP. simple set up and join, 5 minute timers/per turn.. doesn't sound bad. Then, the wait begins.... for the first two people to play, took about 8 minutes, then its my turn... seeing how i planned out my move in those 8 minutes... it took me maybe 10-15 seconds to take my turn... then again another   7-8 minutes... another 10-15 seconds for my turn... this game is going to take forever. we managed to make it to the last turn of the round, then a players time expires. Thinking, Ok AI will join and it'll finally be my turn... nope, another 5 minutes go by and I'm still waiting to take my last turn. 

I exit the app, going back into it, and clicking on my, the, only active game available. I lose Karma, because it said I left the game. What a joke,... Ok maybe it was just bad players... I try it again, 4 turns in, shows a connection screen, and it just keeps loading and loading... looks to be another wasted 25 minutes. Terrible MP service/servers... I'm now 0-2 with no finished games. You can say its my internet connection, but it's not. As i sit here typing this review, im watching the loading symbol go round and round... Don't buy this for the MP... go out spend, $60 on the actual board game (It's def worth is) make some friends, and sit around a table playing the actual game.",1616222301,1642818676,True,0,0,0.530769824981689453,0,True,False,False

I have only played it with my spouse sitting together at the same computer. You can also play it against humans over the Internet or play against Bots.

The art and music is original and endearing. The voice talent is great, and I do forgive her for mispronouncing 'Cache'. The lore is true to life, short and sweet, and clever at times (ref: snipe, etc)

I think what gives the game such deep replay value is that there are so many ways to score and so many overall strategies to employ.

When there is an update, I hope to see some droppings. The game is full of birdsong, which is nice, but in RL they do drop even more than they tweet.

One downside: There are a few birds that are overpowered, such as the Common Raven and forget it if you have a Mockingbird too.

This doesn't happen with any of my other games, so maybe there's a graphics optimization to be done?

End of the day, though? This game is far, far too enjoyable for a graphics hiccup to count against it. Buy it, even when it's not on sale! It's worth it!",1641194048,1641194048,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a board game, so things like 'absolute number of eggs a given bird can lay' are slightly abstracted, but it takes its theme (birds) pleasingly seriously. e.g. the bonuses individual spp give relate to their irl behaviour and traits -- they aren't 'gamey' (no pun intended.) So, no handwaved e.g. 'building a road out of sheep' moments like Catan. Kingfishers get you fish, vultures score off other players leftovers, fruits seem to be a tad harder to acquire (being seasonal) etc. The underlying mechanics are sound, but it's this fidelity to the theme that makes it so cool imo. 

Furthermore, this is a really good adaptation, with lots of thought and care gone into it. The cards - already pretty due to the really solid artwork and stylistic direction of the board game version - are charmingly animated, and the reproduction of the birds' irl calls is an obvious but awesome touch. Not being able to see your whole board at a glance makes it a bit less convenient than the original version, at times, but it's not a huge hindrance or anything. 

I'm not mega into birds, but I like the game a lot and will for sure get my money's worth. I'll almost certainly get the expansioin once it's available.

投稿者：变态双领鸻。（8月16日（水）7时14分22秒）

在昨天和8月十五日老相识的红尾鵟老爷子(30岁)，

和前些日子抽上手的喜欢吃脏东西的美洲乌鸦小哥(15岁)，

以及老夫(53岁)三个人在保护区里大吃了一场。

今天因为明日没有要抽食物的计划，所以带了了很多鼠肉和浆果去了一般无人问津的湿地。

在那里我们吃了很多的鱼以后也就顺势开抽了。

三人互相舔完对方的谷物和虫子之后，把能装满一只林鸳鸯的卵产到了红尾鵟窝里

过了不一会，红尾鵟的卵开始不停的减少，新的鸟卡仿佛灵摆召唤一般在湿地中咕咕作响。
嗷嗷～～真是欲罢不能啊

红尾鵟的蛋被老夫的怪兽效果掏出来抽2后手牌小嘲鸫和渡鸦混合的丝滑感觉真是让人舒服。

美洲乌鸦小哥也将红尾鵟的蛋丢去供应堆换了1浆果

老夫把怪兽效果发动完，点了几下，他就爽快地回合结束了

之后，像是缺少食物一般尽情的在林中捕食了两个回合就一轮结束了

真想再进行一次湿地抽卡啊

果然人多了互相研究鸟卡最棒了。不想与这样的双领鸻一起玩羽毛吗？

啊啊~~快点沾满羽毛罢

如果能在欧洲南部遇到的就好了。 我翼展46cm，老爷子124cm，小哥99cm，想浑身涂满羽毛的人，请尽快来保护区吧。

就带着生态学家奖励卡来召唤，用羽毛来沾满全身吧。",1640920988,1640921060,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

+You enjoy Euro-games (board games) with indirect competitive systems and Victory Points
+You really appreciate tight game mechanics
+You like games that can be played in 15 or 20 minutes
+You want to play board games with friends but can't because everyone is stuck their own houses
+You want something relaxing and wholesome
+You are sick of blood, gore and sex being used as a substitute for well thought out story or mechanics

I suggest thinking twice if:
-You think the game will just be easy, mindless fun. I love games like Gaia Project, and other complex games, and I still lost twice before winning my first game against Easy A.I.   
-You want a long-arched sense of progression. This is not an RPG or ""Survival"" game style. It's based on a board game, with a very tight set of turns; and then the game ends - whether you have done everything that you want to do, or not. 

As for the ""think twice"" points, it's not to say that the game isn't relaxing. Nothing bad happens if you lose after all, and the music and atmosphere are really therapeutic. Also, it's turn-based, meaning you can take a break whenever you want or take your time to think as long as you please. So enjoy the wholesome look and feel, but don't go in expecting a pure ""let your mind drift"" relaxation program.

This is a [u][i]card game[/i],[/u] not a deck-builder; think Mille Bornes, UNO, Lunch Money - not MTG or Pokemon.  It's a deck that gives your options based on the cards you draw, but it's the same deck every game - though expansions are coming and may bring more options.

Before I go further: there are cards to this game and there are achievements.  So far the achis are proving harder to get than I thought.  If you're looking for easy-cheeveys you'll get a few, but overall I'd say this one is a skip for a wandering perfectionist.

[h1] THE REAL BIRD POOP [/h1]

All cards are either birds or bonus cards.  Bonus cards are unique to the player holding them and give extra points at the end of the game if you've achieved the objective listed.  Examples of objectives include ""number of birds that can live in a field/forest/coastline"" and ""how many cards in your hand at the end of the game"" and ""how many birds that eat berries"" and are typical of the bonus card.

Bird cards are the different birds (doy!), each with their own stats and characteristics: lives in forest/field/coastline; wingspan in centimeters; type of nest; number of eggs the nest can hold; point value; food cost to play the card; special abilities.

Birds are played into 1 of three environments/biomes, the aforementioned forest, field, and coastline.  The forest is home to the birdfeeder, which gives all available food options that are available, and does so on up to 5 dice.  When you get down to all the same die/dice or take the last food in the feeder you'll be able to refresh the feeder (or not - pay close attention to your bird abilities!).  There will (generally) be smaller birds with food abilities (when you gain food, the cards tend to give you an additional 'gain food' option) or a hunting option.  The birdfeeder action give more dice picks, the more birds you have played in the biome.

Plains is where your eggs are laid, and like forests with food, the more birds you have played in this biome, the more eggs you will be able to lay.  [i](This is important because it costs eggs to bring out new birds after the first one in any given biome.)[/i]  Plains birds tends to give access to the 'gain food' or 'lay egg' or 'destroy egg to gain [x]' options.

Coastlines will allow your birds to fish for food/score and engage in hunts (draw cards from deck and keep if under a certain wingspan, place as score marker under the card), and most importantly to draw new cards.  The more birds in your hand, the more options you have, but after about 7 or 8 it starts to get hard to easily see them all.

While it is a card game and you must play cards to participate, there are actions that you can take that do not involve cards; as mentioned above, when you use the biome ability (forest is gain food; plains is lay eggs; cost is draw bird cards) each bird in the biome has a turn where their ability is activated.  This is where the true abilities of the cards played gain their value.  For this reason I find great replayability in this game, and that is to say nothing of the coming expansion for European birds (which I plan to buy at release).

[u]Cons:[/u] [list][*]Even playing vs 4 bots, the turns can take half a minute or longer; given the time my turn takes, I expect this will mean fairly slow multiplayer games, though I've not tried multi yet.  Perhaps not Talisman-length, but those first few games... best get to know the abilities of some birds and the flow of the game or they will be long games[*]THERE IS NO ""LET ME TAKE A FEW MORE TURNS!"" OPTION!  GAHH!![/list]

[u]Pros:[/u] [list][*]Ambiance is just beautiful![*]birds are animated (though probably not to real life motions)[*]average AI setting provides a viable challenge, and to play against the Automoton means to be very, very challenged.[*]you're never playing against anyone, just to get your own objectives![/list]

Though I have experienced 3 game crashes total in 70 logged hours (~65 hours of which were active gameplay, not idle), each time it was on my turn and the autosave prevented any loss of time or action.  If every game crashed so gently as Wingspan, one might think that no one would complain ever again; you just restart the game and click the game you were just playing, and play resumes.

There are five different habitats (background graphics) where you can play the game.  The music is just soothing and wonderful.  The goal is to create an Audubon reserve of birds in their natural habitat.  There are three separate sections within your habitat where you can look for food, lay eggs and draw unique birds (over 170 different types).  

The game has trivia about birds, the sounds the birds make and even geographical data inside the menu.  The game might look at first to be complicated, but its rather simple to learn - the in game tutorial is great to teach.  Points are scored in many different ways: from the value of birds placed, the amount of eggs you have laid, milestones to be met four times during the game, an objective card unique to each player, left over food, etc.  This makes it dynamically rich to plan your strategy and score points to be declared the winner.   

Each card has a unique special ability that is activated during certain times of the game.  There are predator birds, but they do not interfere with another player's habitat, which makes it a rather friendly game.  If you like birds - its a must have game.  If you are looking for something a big more zen, that you can cozy up to with a hot chocolate or iced lemonade depending on the weather, its the game to play.  

Average real-time play, about 2-3 hours with three online players (5 minutes in between turns) or you can pick a longer 24 hour per turn based option for meta gaming strategy.

The game is very competitive but you can't really jeopardize other player's engines only max out yours. I enjoy playing it with my friends and family alike.

You have 3 habitats (Forest, Grassland, Wetlands) in which you lay out the bird cards. The game has 4 rounds. In the first round players have 8 actions, every other round one action less. During the action you can either play a bird card, gain food, lay eggs or draw more birds. Birds have special effects and you can combine them in hundreds of unique variations. There are different goals and bonuses you can aim for. The one who has the most points after 4 rounds wins.

My wife had heard something about the board game and was interested in it, and while I was looking to buy the board game, I noticed it was on sale on Steam for $10 which seemed like a much nicer way to try the game out (being that the board game tends to be around $60 normally).

We jumped into it the other day, and it was immediately more complex than we had expected. At first, I was worried my wife was already overwhelmed by the rules, because I was feeling similarly after the tutorial. Even so, we decided to do a few rounds afterwards, and once we got to put it into practice, it flows really well and makes a lot of sense.

It evokes a very similar feeling that I get when playing Hearthstone or Legends of Runeterra. Instead of fantasy and magic, however, it's literally all about birds and developing a board and deck that can synergize enough to give you more ""victory points"" than the other players. That being said, it's not a game that seeks to be hyper competitive, but more relaxing. You don't even need to have any prior knowledge to birds to enjoy it, but there will be nice little trivia bits about new birds as you play them on the board if you're into that (and that can also be disabled).

I have played online multiplayer successfully only a couple times. When another player quits it freezes the game, and I'm unable leave or exit to main menu without having to Alt+F4 the whole thing. Then when I boot back up, I have a ""Karma"" penalty for leaving the game (which you're not supposed to get if you didn't leave first).

The Karma points are difficult to get. You have to complete a multiplayer game without anyone leaving at all. So when your Karma gets burned a couple times by the game, then you are now matched with people who are never going to complete a game. As a result, you will never ever get your Karma back up. Once your Karma gets low, that's it. No more multiplayer for you ever. It seems like a very draconian punishment system for something that is supposed to be a chill game, especially when the game itself is causing Karma crashes.

If you just want to play single-player or you have personal friends to play with, by all accounts it's a pretty good rendition of the board game. You'll get your money's worth out if it. But if you're hoping for casual online multiplayer, then do not buy this game.

EDIT: I did some searching and it turns out that the multiplayer issue has been a known bug for a long time. What is actually happening is that the game doesn't tell you when it's your turn. So it's sitting there endlessly showing it's another player's turn when it's actually my turn, but because it doesn't show my turn I can't take any actions or do anything or actually play the game. So that's why my Karma takes a hit, because technically I was the one who timed out even though it never let me play. It doesn't make much difference though, as this is still the game bugging out in multiplayer and causing Karma crashes due to no fault of the player. And it's not good that this has been a known bug for a while and the developers have not done anything to fix it and it doesn't look like they plan on doing anything to fix it.",1638751601,1639435585,False,152,7,0.885418236255645752,5,True,False,False

Since I'm often staying home due to the pandemic, I don't have a lot of chances to get groups together and play board games, so I gave in and bought this video game edition instead. I'm so glad I did.

Fun, educational, and soothing--and a little competitive, if you're me--you collect and place bird cards to fill each habitat, lay eggs, meet your birding goals, and score points. Play against AI or other players. It's also a game (sort of like Dominion, if you've ever played that) which functions a little like ""multi-player solitaire."" Your board and moves do interact with other players, and I imagine you could play more defensively by snatching a card before someone else can, by making it so someone can't reroll the birdfeeder, etc., but in Wingspan, there are no truly [i]offensive[/i] moves. I love games that let you focus on your own strategy and development to play your best game, and at the end, you size your game up against someone else's. 

My only complaint with this video game is with the interface: it's really annoying to try to mouse over the cards in your hand. The wrong ones always seem to pop up, and if you have your cursor in exactly the wrong place, they pop up and down wildly until you have it in the right spot.

All in all, though, it's a really small issue with a game that I've already sunk a full day of my life into. Get it, play it. Happy birding!",1638725808,1638725808,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When you play each bird for the first time, the game gives you some fun facts about the bird and while you play the game, you can hear different species' chirps and calls. Besides the cards themselves, the game-play is cohesive and at times challenging, especially in the later rounds when you have to prioritize what actions to take to earn the most points.

Game-play is relatively simple, although the tutorial can be hard to follow. There are three habitats that you can play birds in, one for food, one to lay eggs, and one to pick up more cards. Each card has a food cost, has a nest type, and most have an ability. When you proceed with an action (such as laying eggs) birds with abilities that activate upon use are used right to left, so the card you played first in that habitat is used last. This provides players to come up with creative ways to combine multiple abilities in a single turn. 

The main idea of this game is to earn the most points at the end of the game, which can be done through things such as amount of total eggs and end of round goals. With four rounds, that have less turns as you proceed throughout the game, the game encourages players to plan ahead for late end-round-goals, to receive the most points.

For any achievement hunters out there, this game will not be the most difficult out there, but it is sure to cover all its bases with game-play mechanics. Each achievement helps you master the game, and no achievement feels out of place or unnecessarily out of place.

In addition to playing with Automa and with friends, there is also an online function. Online play has been a bit finicky in the past, and if something goes wrong connection wise, the game penalizes you for it, even if it is not your fault. 

Besides fixing online-play and connectivity issues, and the wordiness of the tutorial, I wish this version of Wingspan also had the expansions that the board game version has. I'm sure many players would not mind seeing this implemented, even if it is done as a DLC.

Overall, this is one of my favorite games. For any bird lover out there, this is a must. Especially for those just getting started into birding.",1638311181,1638311181,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Definitely keep track of wins and losses for matchmaking games at the very least.

This data should just be displayed at the top of the Preserve Archive, and I'm surprised it isn't.

The ""Preserve Archive"" should clearly display if the game was a ""Win"" or ""Loss"", or even simply display the place that you finished (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ect.).  The Preserve Archive is almost completely useless in my opinion as you can choose whether to save the game or not.

All of that to say you're going to be playing an hour and a half to 6.5 hour game if you try to play online. The other complaint about these ""Real Time"" online games of Wingspan is that if at hour 2 or 3 someone just doesn't make a play for 5 minutes the game just ends not allowing the other 2 players to finish.

Easy solution for the developer. Lower the turn time to 2.5 minutes or allow 2 player games so that we don't have to set aside a work day to play online. The solution for having someone quit could be to replace them with an AI online with the other two remaining players.

Review

Do you love birds, and engines? You'll also love Wingspan. It is perfectly relaxing, the animations and art style are just as brilliant as the physical game. There is good AI for single player, but of course it is best with friends.

Aside from online play the only minor complaint is that it can feel a bit random. Like everyone else is getting good birds that work well together while you're left with the runts.

Tutorial was pretty excellent, which is very important because the gameplay is a bit confusing.   Highly recommended for people that want a relaxing non-stressful turn-based game to play against Bots or human players.  Also recommended for people that want to learn how to excel at the board game.

Minor quibbles:    

1.  I think the tutorial should spend just a few more sentences at the beginning explaining what you are trying to accomplish.

2.  I think the different between playing a bird and activating a bird is very confusing and should be explained better.

3.  Selecting one bird card from my hand with the mouse was buggy and in at least two games it lead to me playing the wrong bird.   Meaning that as I move my mouse around and various cards jump up, sometimes it was difficult to get the card you wanted.

Minor quibbles, though.  Excellent game!

First, try forcing a specific resolution for Wingspan through Steam. Instructions can be found here: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1040-JWMT-2947

If this doesn't work, could you please try deleting Wingspan data from the registry to see if it helps? To do this:
- press the Windows key+R on your keyboard, type in ""regedit"" and press Enter
- navigate to Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Monster Couch\Wingspan
- delete all of the keys related to resolution and the display (those with ""resolution"" and ""fullscreen"" in the name)
- reinstall Wingspan afterwards

This got the game to open and display correctly, but it wouldn't respond to clicking on any part of the menu. So I did more digging into my computer. 

The game had already been whitelisted by me for my antivirus, but I noticed that my disk usage was pretty much constantly at 100%. I ended up deleting that antivirus program completely and doing a few other chores to reduce the disk usage; with all that bloat cleared and the disk repaired Wingspan is working again. :) Hopefully this will help someone else. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I loved this game until it randomly quit working. It will not load past the first screen. Steam won't help me; I sent an email to the parent company asking for help and also got no response. I've checked my antivirus. I've verified game files. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, checked for updates, restarted, even went into Windows Explorer to try to force it into fullscreen when it wouldn't fully open. No luck.

This game is wonderful but I still have no idea what's causing this and I'm not getting any assistance, so buy at your own risk. If I figure out this problem or get help fixing the game, I'll update the review. If anyone KNOWS what might be happening, please tell me. :(",1630378386,1631636071,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Highly enjoyable, beautiful, relaxing strategy point-salad game!  It's fun right away and there is enough depth that you can spend time mastering if you so choose.

What I do like:
Replay-ability. I've now put in 30 hours and I'm still having fun. The end-of-round goals change per game, so you always have a new objective. You can play multiplayer (with other people or AI), automata, automata/multiplayer hybrid, and online. Lots of set-up options to keep it interesting.

Game strategy. The tension in this game is trying to pick between which essential things you want to do (play a bird, lay eggs, get food, get cards) and having diminishing turns to get stuff done, while also competing for end-of-round objectives. Where it really gets fun is working out how to maximize bird powers/bonuses to build up chains of activities that extend what you can accomplish on a turn. 

Mechanics: There are a lot of detailed mechanics you can get into with this game. It's very clever. You can use food to buy eggs, eggs to buy cards, and cards to buy food. You can stack bird powers to cascade. The rules / gameplay all work seamlessly and are very well done.

Art, Visual Design, and Music: The art is incredibly gorgeous, with beautiful bird and wildlife illustrations and animations. I LOVE that you can click bird cards to hear the bird songs. I love the bird animations. I love music and SFX. Super calming and relaxing.

What I did not like:
The tutorial. I found the tutorial to be very detailed, mechanics oriented, and long, while I wanted to understand the big picture strategy first before getting in the weeds. It is a very thorough tutorial, I just ignored it and learned by playing.

I also read a review that says the end game is a bit underwhelming - I tend to agree with that. In the final round, it's difficult to focus on growing your habitat - the last few turns often feel like a slog to get eggs laid.

The last thing I didn't like is a very minor complaint - in the bird archive, you can't see birds you haven't played at least once. I only have 5-6 unplayed cards, but I have no idea what they are and I can't be on the lookout in-game to collect and play them. The completionism in me finds this annoying.",1631580870,1631580870,True,13,0,0.669090628623962402,0,True,False,False

The game allows for both play against other humans over the network and against computer AI's of different difficulty settings. The physical game also has expansion packs which provide more birds of different geographic locals, so it'll be interesting, as the digital version takes off, to see if these expansions end up getting ported to PC.
A downside to be aware of, however is that online play is *very* slow. While you are allowed to have multiple games running in tandem, drop-outs are common. I've had six games in a row time out, which is frustrating given that your ranking within the community is measured by the amount of ""karma"" you've earned. Each online game you play earns you one karma point (you lose five if you either have to back out of a game or fail to complete your turn during the allotted time limit) and the amount of karma you've earned it used to determine which players you're allowed to play with during random online matchmaking.

I was hesitant to purchase -- historically, I'm used to Steam versions of board games being underwhelming. But this was a fantastic purchase.

The Steam version is an incredibly well-made, charming rendition of the physical board game. It has a lovely soundtrack, neat animations, stellar sound design and dialogue (I love that the birds make their real cries and the voice-over of their factoids), and a great interpretation on the UI. It's a very responsive game -- not laggy or anything. This game has SO MUCH packed into it -- I keep thinking, ""They did NOT have to go so hard on the Steam version of the game, but they did and it has so much love in it."" It's a great rendition. If you enjoy the physical board game, or are interested in it but don't have IRL friends to play it with, this is HIGHLY recommended!

Super cool features include:
- Realistic bird sounds for each of the cards
- Cute tweened animation for each bird card art
- Calming soundtrack
- A way to save all of your games so you can revisit the final board state + scores for all of them
- A bird reference screen for all of each type of bird you've played -- has a great PokeDex feel to it
- Minor customization options for your ""profile"" (avatar, background art, color that are paired with your username)
- A nice multiplayer system, including a ""quicker"" multiplayer mode (3 person matchmaking, each player gets 5 minute turns) and a slower ""asynchronous"" one (72 hours per turn).
- A really cool online ""challenge"" mode that refreshes weekly, and features the highest-scoring player for the last two iterations of that challenge

Minor critiques:
I will say that the UI was just a little confusing at first, and I feel like it might be difficult for someone completely new with the game to use. Coming from the board game helped me overcome this, but I can imagine it being a bit difficult if you're fresh to the game. Take this with a grain of salt -- I didn't play the in-game tutorial since I had the info coming from the physical version, so maybe this makes up for it.

5 minutes feels long for the quick multiplayer mode, wish there was a 3 or so minute one! I also wish you could make your custom games into the 5 minute turn mode as well, rather than them defaulting to 72 hours.

I also wish that when inviting friends into a custom game, it notified you that you should start the game once you're done inviting. I found it confusing that my friends loaded in instantly upon invite, but I was left on the game-building screen. I thought it was a ""lobby"", where you invite everyone then start the game at the same time. If I hadn't had friends in voice chat, I would have sat on that screen for a bit, haha.

I know there's been some older-announced plans for the expansions as Steam DLC, and I hope this comes to fruition soon!

Overall, I highly recommend the game! Stellar rendition.",1630335154,1630335154,True,24,0,0.753203094005584717,0,True,False,False

I own the physical copy and all current expansions, and have even purchased fancier versions of various components. You. Should. Play. This. Game. Anyone of any level of interest should play this game. It's absolutely lovely.

But it's just such a HORRIBLE interface on PC, and the fact that it's a port of a game that already exists means I can't figure out where they put their time and energy. Different birds have different powers, but the powers aren't all that complicated; far less complicated than any run of the mill ccg.

Points are scored based on the birds you've played, the number of eggs you've laid, and the bonuses you've completed. You may play a solo version or square off against computer-generated players; it's really up to you. And I haven't even mentioned the music yet, which is calming and soft.

Can you set time limits when setting up a custom game?  Doesn't look like there are any options to do so.  Want to take a look  at  the other player's mat, you can only do that row by row.  Want to go back from a screen?  Don't look for a back button in the dialog box, like every other application on the planet,  search near the bottom right of your screen.

Selecting cards is a complete pain.  If you have multiple cards in your hand and you are looking at a card, you have to be very, very precise with the mouse to look at the next card.    There are so many other ways this could have been done more effectively!

There are some bird cards that have completely blank text areas, I don't remember that from the board game.

""One turn left""  means ""this is your last turn this round""

When you have a bird that can be only be played in one habitat, and you don't have that habitat selected at the time, the game will cheerfully tell you that you can't play that bird here.  Perhaps, it could be polite and assume that you really did mean to play the bird in the only place that it could be played instead of forcing you to ""DO IT MY WAY"" and make you click out of the error message, click on the proper habitat and then play the card again.

Gameplay:
Basically you need to play a series of cards (Birds), to gain points, some birds have different habitats they need to be in, they need certain foods, and each have different nesting grounds. You need to plan how to achieve that match's goals (Example: To lays eggs in a certain habitat, or to have a certain amount of birds in this one area, etc). The player at the end of the game with the most points, and goals achieved wins.

So the multiplayer was essential for me and it is just terrible. We tried to set a 4-player game multiple times without success. 

First, the invitation goes via Steam, which may be inconvenient and little finicky, but ok, I can live with that. But the game is so buggy that we were not able to even make our first move. When I finally got into the game, I didn't know who's move it is, what are the player's names, what is the order.. And when it seemed it was my first turn (after selecting starting resources and bonus card), I just couldn't do anything despite I was getting tooltip hints what to do if you want to do this or that action. But the action just didn't work. 

It just blows my mind, how this multiplayer version could make it into public. One would think that if you are not even able to make it to the first move, the QA would catch it right away, no..?

As mentioned earlier, I only tried multiplayer. Maybe the single player, or AI is great, but if you want to play this game with friends remotely, save your money. Sad :(",1625034830,1625035433,False,1,0,0.493843197822570801,0,True,False,False

1. Meanwhile other games sell you one or five extra cards for a 20% of the original game in a DLC this people put  some new cards for free. They are my new heroes, I'm sick of the lack of good intentions nowadays, no fucking decency man. When they release a DLC we will pay very happy to this PROFESSIONALS and DECENT team. There was no need for new cards, the game is solid but they just put it for free anyway.

2. The game is a peaceful and good strategy card-game in which luck is an important factor but you have so many options to make your strategy that you will always be able to find new interesting ways of making your match. Strategy is very important in this game, luck alone will never be enough.

3. Perfect to play with your couple, just connect another mouse to the computer. Do it! you won't regret it.

4. Nice music, artwork, mechanics, IU and very coherent for a good and short casual game.

The only a negative issue I could speak of is that he tutorial may be a little bit slow for my taste, but this is not problem at all since after 1 to 3 matches you will know pretty much everything to start seeing the real potential of this easy-to-play but difficult-to-master-game.

I deeply believe you should try it out at least, if only all the casual games were so good!

I really enjoyed the board game but all the tiny eggs and such were pretty cumbersome to mange, and with a dog running around a bumped table was always a possibility. The digital version keeps every bit of the fun from the game and then upgrades it with ease of play. 

The bird facts are fun to hear (and eventually retain;-) while the same artwork from the boardgame was utilized and upgraded with some animations. Great to hear the birds calls as you lay them too! No more trying to remember to take your between turn actions either as when you are eligible for one it pops up. 

I also wish I had known what the soundtrack was when purchasing as I would have added it on. It is extremely mellow but up and very relaxing in a new age nature kinda way. But as I hear it for hours everyday while playing the game, I guess I really don't need the MP3 anyways LOL. 

Highly recommend this game for people who think they are master strategist cause those rolls of food and deals from the bird deck will have ya rethinking your plan every other turn!

This isn't a deck builder: you won't be opening card packs to add birds to your deck nor will you be buying cards from a pool to add to that match's deck you will be using. It is an engine building game in that you pickup cards to play into habitats. Each habitat will allow you to perform a different action: pick up food from a central pool all players have access to, place eggs on cards, and draw cards. Playing birds into a habitat will allow you to activate their powers when ever you perform the habitat power there so making sure that your birds can feed each other on the board is important. This is a game will have a degree of luck but long-term planning is crucial and can make a victor out of a poor starting hand.

Digitisation - Awkward in places, but entirely functional once you understand how it works. No major complaints.
Online play - Buggy and poorly put together (e.g. I can't see when friends are actually in my game because their portraits don't load, friends who join me can only see me and nobody else) but functional. The fact that the game even HAS online multiplayer is a plus, really, because the majority of board game digitizations on Steam don't.

In other words, I frequently lose, due to calculations, yet after double checking what the A.I. players had done, it was not accurate.
There is also one fundamental flaw in the number of turns in this game.  At each of the 4 phases there is just not quite enough time to utilize the engines that a person would try to make.

Interesting note about this game, it is and ""engine building game"" with the main focus on building your own ""habitat"".  It is definitely competitive where you are trying to earn points based off of actions taken however the most charming part of the game is that your ability to negatively ""affect"" other players is fairly much non-existent.

Your starting birds and bonus cards can vary greatly and this can lead to mild RNG. Being able to get 2-3 birds out early vs 1-2 birds and/or having a bonus card that works with your starting hand vs one that has no synergy with your starting hand is a factor.

I was first introduced to the board game and quickly snapped this up afterward.  I feel the playmat view is more intuitive (which is available through a button in this version but is what you'd be used to in the board game version).  Being able to see all rows simultaneously without toggling and then not took some adjustment.

As an old time MTG fan, I love the complexity and how certain cards, or card combos, can be total game changers if you're paying attention -- for those who aren't, its not that spicy relax.   At the same time there is an obvious and deliberate lack of competitive elements, even the ones present have optional modes that individualize achievement.  I feel like that deserves some attention, its like the anti-Monopoly.  Even uber competitive types might be lulled into chilling out with the birdsong and less-zero-sum nature of the gameplay.

It has a learning curve.  You might even feel weird about this.  Just buy it.

Alright.
Painful to give a thumb down to this beautiful digital adaptation... but it has to be done. 
At least until the devs fix the mp aspect of the game (see below)

[h1]Single Player[/h1]
The game itself is great: from the cards animations, to the soothing music and nature sounds playing in the background.
It's a beautiful, relaxing experience with easy-to-lean game mechanics that also rewards strategic thinking. RNGs are there in the form of cards drawing and dice rolling but balance is not heavily impacted by those and most of the time your engine helps you to achieve what you need when your sequence of birds special powers triggers.
AI's ok but not that smart... I haven't tried the Hard AI yet (currently indicated as Beta) though or the Automa version which is different from an AI match in the sense that you play against a pre-determined deck and need to follow specific rules. Physical boardgame has this option so you can play Solo mode basically.
So, SP mode works just fine.

Then...

[b]here comes the MP[/b]

As others have indicated, the MP part is lacking.
Here's what MP needs to properly function.

[h1]LOBBY MENU[/h1]
- [b]Custom settings[/b]. 
Need to have at least the possibility to decide turn's length (5 min limit is too much and 24hrs may be not enough)
Also, the physical boardgame is for 1 to 5 players. Here we have only a hard limit of 3: no more, no less. Why? Need an option to modify this value.

- [b]Names of players in games you're participating to[/b]. 
There's no way to tell who you're playing against as the games listed in the lobby don't show the names of your opponents when hovering or clicking on them! This is quite annoying cause if you have 3 or 4 games open for example, you want to know which game is which.

[h1]IN-GAME[/h1]
- [b]Chat is missing[/b]. 
I know this might lead to unwanted abusive chats but at least two or three emoji would do the trick so you can somehow communicate with your opponents. Otherwise there's literally no interaction and you feel you're just playing alone.

-[b]Action logs[/b]. 
An icon should open a separate panel where you can see the moves done by the other players. This is useful when you have several games opened and you want to be on top of what's going on in each game. This would also take care of the issue of which food the other players took from the birdfeeder.

Additionally, you should have an option to disable the tooltips as they keep appearing when hovering on UI elements. They're fine at the beginning but in the way after you understand what is what.

I should also mention there's a minor glitch that happens when you're viewing what your opponent is doing on their tableau. Sometimes you're sent back to yours for no reason (maybe because the opponent is moving through his habitats or completing their actions?). 

So, fixing these should do the trick and make the game shine also in MP cause at the moment it gives you sort of a bitter aftertaste for being such an amazingly well done digital adaptation of the physical boardgame.

Hopefully the devs will take action, then I'll be gladly change my review and give the rightful thumb up this game deserves.

[b]# Updates #[/b]

Big patch today! 400MB!
Who-hoo you'd say, right? Hold your horses (or birds)
This is what they've been able to come up with after all the bugs reports they got so far:

[Here's a quick list rundown, because everyone loves lists, especially during spring... right?

Features:
new, limited-time spring background added
Spring ""Champ of the Birds"" challenge coming on 29th March]

That's it. 
400 MB of absolute nothing
Devs are really showing they've NO INTEREST whatsoever in fixing MP and game breaking bugs.
What a disappointment

3/07 
------
There has been around for a while now a pretty infuriating bug that prevents you to invite friends (or be invited) to a game. The game won't show in MP lobbies, no matter what. 
It'll only show if you and your friends are in-game at the same time. Then, once everyone has joined the game, async mode can take place.

To aggravate this, Steam Turn Notifications doesn't seem to work reliably so dropping out of a game because of time expiration w/o knowing it's your turn is a very common occurrence.

Lastly, I'd like to add a few more suggestion to the list I indicated in my original review in the hope the devs will read them and take note.

- We need to know the number of cards-in-hand of other players.
- Please remove those xbox controller icons when using mouse.
- Fix the hotspots for your cards-in-hand when playing with the mouse (as their animation starts way before the cursor gets over them).
- We need the possibility to rename games in the Preserve Archive (right now is just a long list of unrecognizable items)
- Stats such as game won/lost, average score, end game goals success rate, laid eggs, bugs eaten, food stacked, mice swooped etc etc. would be nice.",1613486468,1617051768,False,65,0,0.776276111602783203,1,True,False,False

The game is played over a series of 4 rounds, each with a specific objective that awards points, then totals are totted up based on the birds played, how much food is stashed or eggs laid and those aforementioned bonus points.

It's one of the most relaxing and beautiful board games I know - physical or online - and I absolutely love that the online version has the birds animated and with their actual sounds and little factoids about each bird when you play it. 

You can tell that serious work and love has gone into making this version of the game and it is truly a masterpiece as a result of that. 

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys board games - as it is so versatile. You can play by yourself, or with friends, or online with friends or strangers in both real-time and asynchronous games.

If I had to describe this game in the fewest of words. It feels like a game that was made in Poland, then localised poorly to a north american audience by and art school graduate. I feel like I should be wearing lens-less glasses (while wearing my contacts) while playing this game. Vegan hipster monopoly? I'm not sure how to describe it. So, here are a few of my take aways.

Concept - Sure. I dig it enough that I bought it.

Execution - This game is both good and bad. It does have some decent strategy and can be fun. But the game is very not intuitive. And you know what? Fault on me, I didn't play the tutorial. I didn't notice it when I went in first, and had zero hand holding and no instruction. I failed my way through a couple games enough to learn some of the basics. I could almost functionally play the game at this point. 

By the time I found the tutorial it was so slow and insufferable that I couldn't stand to wait through it. Not because I wouldn't learn anything. I have to believe with how convoluted the rest of the game is, the tutorial has to explain everything. Maybe. But my takeaway here is that they don't have a glossary. Or again, maybe they do and I didn't find it. But when you see that certain skills activate ""brown powers"" (literally what it is called, brown powers), or just context-less symbols in a ability description with no idea what that symbol means and no quick way to reference it, the game becomes no fun.

However, I thought it was balanced well enough based on my playing. There were some combinations that felt overpowered/broken, but my experience is limited and I never did get better at the game.

The art is decent. The bird art is quite nice honestly, The bird sounds are very nice (and minimally varied, meaning you wont hear the same soundbite over and over), but the backgrounds and the rest of things I would say are passable. Nothing really special honestly, but they work.

Here is the TLDR which I am deliberately putting at the end. I don't know who this game is for or what it is competing against. I wouldn't even call it as exciting as monopoly, and with great classics already I guess I don't see where this one fits in. I suppose the market is over-saturated as it is so what is another on the pile.

But I don't have that feeling that this game SHINES in any unique way that you cant get elsewhere, except one. If you want a card game that you play with birds on the cards, with tiny pieces of sometimes oddly related trivia but really decent voices for the birds, then sure buy this game. But the game isn't super fun. It is kind of addictive, but I find you not really feeling any sense of accomplishment after. Sort of like Solitaire.

You'll like this game if:

-you like card games
-you are okay with unpredictability as you'll have to switch your game strategy around each game
-your gameplay style is flexible
-you want a game you can play with others on the same machine or remotely

-you like having a high level of control over your game
-you want varying styles of gameplay; Customization over game rules is limited
-you think you will feel compelled to play 15 birds each game
-you need action in your games
-you dislike strategy games when trying to relax

Pros of this game:
-Great music!
-Wide variety of birds
-You can change your habitat skin to one of 6 available
-I like being able to choose purple as my character color

Cons of this game:
-If you have too many cards in your hand they get difficult to play
-Not many modes of gameplay

Could be pros or cons:
-No unlockables
-6 habitat skins currently
-15 character portraits

Players have up to 5 minutes for each turn, and during other player's turns, there is absolutely nothing to do but sit and wait - with online being 4 players, this means you will take your turn and play the game for about 3 minutes, and then wait up to FIFTEEN MINUTES before there is anything more you can do.

And if any players drops out, the game ends. Yes, you can finish against local AI, but you cannot continue online. It's over. The number of times I've had a game end in the last 3 turns because a player clearly unable to pull out a win has dropped is maddening.

There is no way to communicate with one another - with up to fifteen minutes every round of nothing to do, at least being able to chat with each other - INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER - would be nice. If boardgames serve to bring people closer together and to enjoy a shared experience, this digital version of this board game does the exact opposite.

I waited months in the hopes that this would be addressed or fixed, but the developers seem to think this is the ideal online boardgame experience. It is not. It is, in fact, one of the worst ever designed.

Only buy this if you want to practice against AI - do not buy this if you have any hope of enjoying the game with other players online. You wont.",1615523037,1615523037,False,196,8,0.882776558399200439,0,True,False,False

Still no response from developers to my emails or posts. Recent patches to the game seem to have resolved my core game-play complaints (keeping accurate score), so I am changing my review to a thumbs up. I get that the developers perhaps were well aware of the bugs, but would have been nice to at least let us know that they were on a list somewhere.

Revised 2/6/2021:

Still no response from developers to my emails or posts (other than the generic one below which I did respond to but got silence in return). Acknowledgement of the issue or pointing me to a bug tracker would be a great way to allow users to provide input on the game and feel like they are being heard. Up to know, I am not feeling the love. Getting the score wrong on MOST games just would seem like a high priority item to me. If it was fixed (or at least promised to be fixed), I could go back to recommending it. Until then I need to stop playing it... causing too much frustration for me. :-(

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revised 1/14/2021:

The defects aren't just limited to counting eggs apparently. The issue seems to revolve around when you are the last player in a round. Basically when you are on your last turn of a round, and you are the last player, not much that you do gets factored into the end-of-round goals. Playing a bird, laying eggs, etc... Basically the game doesn't recalculate what you did prior to determining the end-of-round scoring. Looking back at prior discussion threads and apparently this has been going on since the games release last year.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bit of a love/hate relationship with the digital version of this game. It has some pretty pronounced bugs that I have communicated to the developers but still haven't seen resolution... Counting Eggs seems to be a constant challenge for some strange reason. I frequently find the app has not counted eggs properly. Sometimes it is just a temporary thing, like it hasn't refreshed the display elements, but several times it has affected scoring both at end of the round and at the end of the game. I have seen lots of variations on this problem, and it really ruins an otherwise perfect game for me. I have sent screenshots and detailed descriptions of the issue to the developers, but no reply. Acknowledgement of my email would be nice...

One other item is their online synching/timing issues... When it was first released, I started 2 online (24-hr) games and within 2 HOURS the system timed out *both* games and said I had taken too long (inflicting -10 points on my game ""karma"" as punishment). I have been trying to dig out of that hole ever since but being paired with players who often let their games timeout makes that hard. I have had two other game timeout unexpectedly (blaming me in both cases). One was my fault... Yes, I took too long... but the other was not. Hard to challenge it when the game just goes away.

If I was not experiencing these two issues, Wingspan would be a perfect 10/10 in my book. It is otherwise a perfect digital version of the board game. As it stands however, it is a frustration for to play. I wish there was more communication from the developers on release notes, updates, etc. The monthly release notes seem to comment on ""minor"" fixes and never seem to acknowledge or address the more functional bugs.

But I thought this was an easy and enjoyable way to learn the game and play. The art is beautiful and the music is relaxing. The game play is also very addicting. The mechanics are good and there is a lot of strategy involved.

I also like the fact that you can play against the AI or the automata, both of which make solo play great. I tried asynchronous multiplay but wasn't very impressed. It was difficult to tell whose turn it was exactly, and having to wait on other players for an indeterminate amount of time (well, up to 24h) didn't make it as fun. I have yet to try multiplayer in real time...

Overall I highly recommend it. I'm actually looking at purchasing the board game now and playing it solo, but also with my friends and family!

I tried some other AI games, on easy, I get beaten by 30 plus points every time. I cannot figure out how to play this game and not lose, and what makes this so much worse is the game has huge bugs. Most of the time I can't see the AI players cards so I have no idea what they are doing and if I try to look at their board at the end of the game so see how I got so wrecked the game wont show me and then it soft locks and I have to Alt Tab out, EVERY TIME.

So to sum it up, the game is super hard, I can't figure out why or what I am even doing wrong and I can't see how the computer plays even thought its supposed to be able to show you because of bugs. 

Maybe if I was already a fan of this game I'd recommend, but for me it was just frustration and confusion.

-The bonus cards will keep track of how many points they're scoring, as will the end round goals
-You don't have to shuffle all. those. cards.

The bad:
-The separate bioms are frustrating and feel unnecessary. Not being able to see all your cards at once may not be, strictly speaking, necessary, but I got little out of using the separate bioms instead of just playing in the full-board overlay.
--However, the game didn't feel designed to be played completely from the full board overlay, as a few actions felt choppy.
-The game will not let you see all your cards in your hand at once, rather you need to click through a poorly-executed hand where the cards all overlap each other. It is incredibly easy to choose the wrong card to tuck, as the controls are not incredibly intuitive. This was almost game-breaking for me, I ended up tucking a card I wanted to play the next turn and was unable to undo it.
-Controls cannot be mapped to other keys
-It doesn't let you completely choose keyboard vs controller? So you always have xbox buttons displayed even when it is not plugged in (if there is a way to commit to an input, I couldn't find it throughout an entire game, making that an additional critique).
-The video settings are minimal, so graphics quality and many of the animations (the ""animations"" checkbox only applies to the bird animations, not to the dragonflies flying about the screen) cannot be adjusted.
-The game could be much clearer on what turn is happening, instead it looks like your turn has been skipped when another player is choosing their ""once between turns"" perks, because the symbology only conveys who is active, not which turn is current. 

So overall, I do not recommend this port, primarily because of the issue with cards. It could be improved by implementing a system like Terraforming Mars' port, which lets you choose cards from a menu pop-up instead of the faux-hand this game gives you.

Pros:
1)  Very easy to learn.  My 6-yr old loves playing the game.
2)  A tutorial mode.  I learned to play the game using the tutorial mode.  Played the digital version and enjoyed it so much that we went and bought the physical game.
3)  Solo playing in either the Automa mode (from the physical game) or against AI.  The normal AI is somewhat competent (the AI will win sometimes).  There's a ""hard"" AI in the works.
4)  Nice to hear the bird sounds.
5)  Can remote play against other ppl in the family.  So one can play from a PC in one room and be joined by others on another PC in another room.

Cons:
1)  Haven't yet tried to play online but there's reports of issues.  But this seems to be a common problem for other boardgames as well.

The game is recommended for those who already enjoy the tabletop version or enjoys a good 'puzzle' game as the the number of birds and goals available will keep each games fresh and different.

The digital version is beautifully made and stay true to the original game. Its easy to play, pretty intuitive, its turn base nature allows you to 'multitask' doing other stuff while waiting for your turn, the achievements can be quite challenging, the latest online automa challenge adds another layer of challenges for those who wants something different and the soundtrack is very relaxing that I even listen to while studying. The bird calls are a nice addition that is impossible with the table top version and makes the game come to life! As a birder I appreciate this even more.

As a huge bird nerd who chills out to strategy games in a casual setting, discovering Wingspan's existence was an epiphany. It's really just an all-round perfect combination of my hobbies. Sometimes when I'm reading or writing, I'll just keep the game open and use the music and birdsong as ambience. Pure bliss.

So, uh, maybe I'm a bit biased. But I maintain it's a great card game, even if you're not as crazy about birds as I am.

The rules are fairly easy to pick up, and the tutorial is well-explained. The interface is quite user-friendly as well, so if you forgot a rule or are too cool for tutorials, chances are that clicking or hovering over the thing in question will give you the info you need. 

Speaking of info you need, whenever you play a bird, the game gives you a bit of info about that specific bird, or the one who named it. That's right: This game is also educational. After a few hours of playing Wingspan, chances are you'll be able to weird out your friends by rattling off bird facts that they didn't ask for-- just like me!

Music? Terrific. Ambience? Heavenly. I think I've already gushed about this enough.

A single game of Wingspan against 4 AI players typically doesn't last longer than 30 minutes, so it's still very accessible even if you're short on time. I'll play a round every so often during my writing just to refresh my noggin.

A few minor issues I came across...

- It's sometimes a bit difficult to scroll over/select the card you want if you you have a ton of cards in your hand.

- I've noticed an AI player can get ""stuck"" during a match from time to time, with plenty of resources and a hand overflowing with cards, that the AI simply... chooses not to play. It seems to happen more often on Normal difficulty than on Hard, so maybe it's intentional. I dunno. I always play with 5 players, so it doesn't ruin the experience if one of them has gone senile.

- Very rarely, the game can crash to desktop randomly, usually around the very beginning of a game, when the AI is selecting their starting cards. The game will always save your progress, and there are no loading screens, so it's really just a matter of re-opening the game. You'll be back where you left off in under a minute.

So... yeah. This game is something to crow about. Pick it up, and enjoy the birbs!",1611659995,1611659995,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It honestly beggars imagination, both in terms of actual bugs, and of poorly thought-out mechanics in the interface. I'm rather mad about how much they botched this port. Some complaints of mine follow.

In order to join an online game with a friend, I have to go check the steam chat, click a button there, and then go back to the game. I should not have to leave the game in order to join an online game.

When I click to accept an invitation to join an online game, while in the main screen of the game (the one where one selects single player, online game, options, etc.), the game shows some nonsense message about not having enough slots for the game, even though the invitation was accepted and there were no issues. It shouldn't show those messages.

When the game starts and one must choose which birds/food tokens to keep, clicking to select birds has no effect, while the board view is selected; one must change to the other board view in order to select birds. It should not matter what board view is in effect for selecting birds.

The bird cards are incomplete, they don't have the icons for the additional goals (photographer, historian, etc.) and because of that the game also lacks the goals for those bird features.

The birds hunted by prey birds are rendered with the wrong icon; instead of showing the little bird-like jolly roger used for these birds, it shows the icon for the bird flock.

When choosing a bird card to place on the board, the click ""goes through"" the card, and triggers a click over the board, which usually lands on the ""take bird card"" area of the board, instead of just selecting the bird card to place.

While executing the brown actions of a bird, while using the board view of the reserve, it's not possible to switch between the two visualizations of each bird card; this is a problem if one needs to check what's a bird's special action while running the whole brown-actions-pipeline.

Whenever I play a bird that allows me to play a second one in the same ecosystem, the game highlights not only those that I can play since they belong to the same ecosystem, but also highlights mistakenly some that I can't because they belong to a different ecosystem.

When I take food from the feeder, and I take a worm/seed using the dice side that has both options, I can't see which one I took, because the game keeps showing me the worm/seed side of the dice.

While in the per-ecosystem view of the reserve, the bird cards already played in any ecosystem are floating, and moving a little bit. That's tremendously annoying to me, and there's no option to disable that.

The game layout wastes lots of space, and ends up putting the action description for each bird separate from the other bird features, forcing the player to click back-and-forth to use all that information during a move.

The in-game help is triggered needlessly everywhere; I can't let the mouse cursor rest over anything because the damn thing will suddenly pop out, even though I don't need it.

The whole interface has terribly poor discoverability; every single player I know that has tried it has struggled tremendously to figure out for the first time how to perform the actions they want. This has happened to both seasoned Wingspan players, and to computer-savvy players, even those already familiar with online gaming and Steam.

When another player finishes her move, my screen gets re-drawn, needlessly.

The game takes a ridiculous amount of time to switch turns, on the order of 5+ seconds, even though the connectivity here is OK and there is nothing else consuming network bandwidth. The same happens whenever occurs an event that involves actions from several players, like the hummingbird's each-player-takes-one-food, or all-players-take-one-card.

When I'm looking at another player's board, and another player finishes her turn, my view gets re-set to show me my board. This is quite jarring.

At the end of a round, the game occasionally will skip showing to me my results for the round goal.

The game manages to use two CPUs at 100% during the whole match, and takes up to a minute to start on my machine. I understand the need for that in a 3D game that needs to render complex scenes at 60hz+, but this is a board game; other online services for playing board games don't have this kind of issue. I'm amazed they managed to waste so much computing power for doing something so simple, and keep wondering whether whoever programmed this is only capable of architecting things by putting them inside a game loop and recalculating/redrawing everything continuously.

The bird animations (the ones shown in the pre-game screens) are rather tacky, in my opinion, and actually unnecessary.",1611532880,1611532880,False,0,3,0.471491217613220215,0,True,False,False

But I’m still happy that I brought Wingspan. It is a truly beautiful game with interesting mechanics. There’s also a card collecting section with knowledge about the birds you use with each game you play. You can tell a lot of hard work went into this project.

From the moving bird animations and the art itself. Wingspan is a pleasing and relaxing experience. I do like the music too but it can get a bit repetitive after a while. I would also like more offline content instead of just battling the AI for no rewards or any kind of progression. And I should state that I have not played the multiplayer due to my low skill level of board games, therefor I cannot make a judgement on that front just yet.

One of my favorite aspects of the board game, was it's thoughtfulness (in terms of design).  Little details that help you understand the game mechanics. The same is brought to the digital version. The UI is well layed out, and the tips and help along the way make this game enjoyable - not frustrating. 

The feeling you get when you play this game is: peaceful. The music is soothing and the sounds of the birds and nature really complete the atmosphere of the game. I have been enjoying firing this game up each morning with my cup of coffee, as a peaceful way to start the day (and learn a bunch about new birds!)

I would HIGHLY recommend this game... even as a meditative/therapeutic  device during these tough times. You will not be disappointed!",1611063253,1611063253,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't think it's nearly as good as a digital experience and can't recommend it. This is an engine building game with very little interaction between players, and the loss of humans sitting at a table is too significant. The interface makes it difficult to keep track of what other players are even doing on their turns, so you're sort of left with your own board and no sense of how other players are doing on theirs, or even what birds they're playing. At my table, we always oooh and ahhhh over the birds as they are played and sometimes read the little trivia snippets to each other. In digital Wingspan it's hard to even know *when* another player is playing a bird since the interface does not naturally follow along with the actions of other players.

Whether or not you're going to win feels like a crapshoot - and that's sort of how it is with tabletop Wingspan, but it's felt more keenly here since you won't be looking at the other boards very much, and you don't have anyone to talk to while you play.

The automa mode is similarly diminished since, again, it's hard to follow along with how the automa is doing on its turns, so you're really just hoping you're doing better.

Pretty disappointing! I'm not sure how this can be fixed. It just doesn't feel like a good fit for this medium.",1610790524,1610790524,False,12,0,0.593973517417907715,0,True,False,False

A really great game to play, especially to stay connected with friends during quarantine. If you've played the board game and are curious if the online version holds up, it does.

The online is a little bit of a mess and doesn't always let you know in real-time whether your friends have joined the game yet or not. Sometimes you'll be waiting in the lobby for a player to join when they have infact already joined / are in the game, or vice versa. You can remedy this by just letting each other know when you're in the game. I really wish that there was a friends chat window in-game, but there isn't.

I'm a huge fan of Wingspan. I've got many hours in this game and I've achieved 100 karma on the online matchmaking. It is so incredibly frustrating when you get great birds in your hand and all of a sudden the game drops you for no reason at all. This happens to me or someone in my game about 10-20% of all the games I play online. This is simply unacceptable.

Also, once the network issues are fixed, it would be a huge improvement to be able to join a party with friends and queue for online matchmaking which is not possible right now. I consider this to be a pretty basic feature and the online feels completely unfinished without it.

I have a few UI gripes: If you start a live game together, you can't see your opening hand of cards (or start planning anything) until the players before you have finished making their selections. In real life, this would be a simultaneous thing, but when playing via this app, it becomes one of the slowest parts of the game. Other little details: The Automa option is neat, but the interface doesn't really explain what the hell the AI is doing, and there's no way to know unless you look it up in the board game rulebook. Speaking of which, why isn't the rulebook included in this app somewhere? You can't see how many bird cards are in players' hands. It's kind of hard to see what other players are doing in real-time. 

The individual biome views are pretty, but kinda cumbersome, but luckily they've included a top-down view of the whole player board, which I use pretty much exclusively. Mouse wheel to scroll between different parts of the cards is well-implemented. Where's the keyboard shortcut to toggle between different player's boards?

- Fantastic artstyle, animation, theme, and sound design (I can't emphasize enough how calming it is to play this game casually)
- When you get a good engine going, it feels great 
- The weekly challenge is a nice addition to the game. This mode allows you to essentially remove the randomness from the game and plan your perfect game.

Cons:
- This game has way more elements of randomness than other engine building games I've played. This is only a downside if that bothers you in this genre.
- The game only works like 95% of the time. Rarely I'll experience an issue where I can't play a card or due an action or something gets skipped.
- The online mode seems slow when transferring to another players turn. When playing other engine building games online, there's maybe 2-3 seconds of gap between transfer of turns. I've experienced gaps of ~10 seconds at the most. This is a super minor inconvenience, don't put too much weight into it. We only noticed the gap because we were playing side-by-side on different computers. You won't notice if you're playing purely online in different areas.

Your task is to play and place different birds into three different habitats - forest, meadow and shore. The majority of the birds have an ability and those abilities help you in different ways - getting food (to play more birds) or laying eggs e.g.

You get feathers a.k.a. points for various things in the game - birds, eggs, end-round goals, storagged food or tucked cards etc.

The player with the most feathers at the end of the game wins.

The base game has a bird deck of 170 different and unique cards so every game differs from the previous one. You can also experiment with different kind of strategies.

How they have featured the cards and the images of the birds, is amazing, it has been re-created digitally very perfectly, the music is very nice too.

One negative thing i have to say about this, is that there is no in-game chat. I have joined the global group chat on actual steam friends-list, but a lot of times, if you are in the game with random people, they are not part in the group chat, so you still cant talk. Even if they brought out a visual text chat box on the screen, that would be cool... But that is the only negative thing i have to say about it, as one online game with 3 players can take a couple of hours; therefore it would be nice to talk to someone that you are playing the game with..

Otherwise, i would say its the best digital version of any board game. They have done a fantastic job, and if you love the actual board game, i would highly recommend getting this digital version.

I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a solo or small group game. It functions well in solo mode against AI, and online with friends.
The mechanics of the game are well thought out, and once understood, are incredibly straight-forward. The use of individualized goals mixed with round goals for everyone keeps the game competitive, but amiable. Each game is further different in that no cards are duplicated. Though I don't think all the cards from the physical version of the game are incorporated yet, there is a well selected range of birds and their abilities in the game at this time.
Auto-gameplay is well done. Players are guided and shown what different moves they can make based on the section of the 'board' they are on. The guidance is much appreciated in a game that could become overwhelming with the number of options and cards that can be involved.
Auditory controls are very well organized, and easily manipulated. They are located where you would anticipate them to be, and granular enough to create what could be called your individual perfect auditory experience.
My only qualms are very minor in nature. The undo button is not where you intuitively expect it to be. If you have the option to undo during your turn, the button is located in the bottom left. In software I use, I expect it to be located in the upper left. Another minor issue are the player hands.

I bought this to figure out whether I would want the board game. Gameplay is different from other card games I've played and after figuring it, I out I really like it. You basically place bird cards on three rows and activate those rows to get resources and use bird abilities to maximize your points. I haven't played multiplayer except versus bots, but it largely feels like a solo game aside from the community birdfeeder, bird pile, and between-turn actions.

Try to build your engine in the different bird habitats and make your flocks thrive. Gain food, Feed your birds, build nests, Make card combinations to earn points. There are game and personal achievements to be earned.  

After opening the game I played the tutorial. It was long and needed some dedication to learn how to handle the controls. Once these are clear, I found out there are several control options, with an Xbox controller, the mouse or even remote stream to a tablet with the touchscreen of my tablet. 
Playing a full length game takes some time, almost one hour or even more if you play online. So it is super to be able to play in my sofa. 
The layout looks fine and can be personalized with different backgrounds. There is also a card section with an overview of all played cards. It feels like those oldshool sticker books :).  The bird art is amazing, The birds do move a little in the game, but these animations can be dissabled. 

This board game can be played alone, against the computer or online with a group of people. Finishing a game earns karma. On Discord you can find other bird enthusiasts to play with. The original matching system needs to be tweaked, because now lots of people start a game and leave after a while. Leaving the player with nothing more than a notification and no karma points.

If you're not into face paced, first person shooters, or crazy difficult war strategy games, or mind numbing click and do stuff silly games, then this is the game for you. Even non-bird lovers will like this game for the challenge an engine building game offers. It's so fun to try different strategies, improve your deductive reasoning skills and master the cards as they come at you. Along the way, you might even develop a liking for the little and not so little fellas too. I really enjoy the narration on each bird as they're played.

A tutorial is included so you can learn how to play from the game. The game walks you through each step using text dialog boxes (no narration, unfortunately), so you can learn at your own pace.

You can start a local game against Automa (the IRL version has a way to play single player and this is carried over to the computer version), a human, and AI (easy, normal, hard).  Of course, like IRL, you can play from 1 to 5 players.  You can even change each player's color, bird type and mat appearance by just clicking on the player in the local game initiation. Local games can be paused by just exiting and easily continued. Once a game is complete, you can preserve the game in the archive for comparison. Want to go back to that archived game and check out the birds, and eggs, and tucked cards? Just click on the archived game and you can go to the archived game as it was when it completed, even allowing you to look at the other players game mats as well.

Want to challenge real humans? Click on the ONLINE button to open up a connection to the interwebs of Wingspan players around the world.  Use the matchmaking option for real-time or asynchronous(24 hours max per turn - think chess via snail mail, only a tiny bit faster).  Or you can create a custom game and invite your online friends, who don't need to own the game, just have a free Steam account.

Had I known the online game was so amazing, I would have purchased it right after I picked up Wingspan from my local gaming store.  Now I can enjoy Windspan IRL with friends and family and in a world pandemic safe way in front of my computer screen.

Between myself and 3 other regular tabletop players, we bought this as something to play long distance during the pandemic.

After 2 or 3 hours of frustration of trying to sort through the multiplayer and all of it's bugs the other 3 players eventually requested a refund from Steam. Things we encountered:

-a player would randomly not be allowed to take their setup step (i.e. the player wasn't allowed to choose a combination of birds and food). This resulted in that player starting the game off with no birds in hand and no food, which basically made the game unplayable for them based on how long it would have taken them just to get their engine going
-problems with player timers not displaying your turn time correctly
-problems with even joining the game

EDIT:  This negative aspect is no longer an issue.  After using this fix in the comment to just get in the game, I could launch normally from Steam.

One drawback, and it is huge... I was playing and decided that I wanted it to be windowed.  So, I started to adjust it as I was on a 2k format and wanted it to be within the 2nd 1920x1080 and somehow the dialogue box to confirm stopped coming up and I was around the 1600x1200 mark, still able to set the size and then it just crashed.  No problem, I will just restart the game and... nope.  I get a peach colored square in the middle of my screen, a Unity window appears, stops at 40%, and closes the game.

For example, the cowbird propagates itself through the nests of other birds parasitically. In Wingspan, the cowbird card allows you to generate a free egg in a particular nest type if another player chooses to produce eggs.

Notably, Wingspan is one of the few games in which ""losing is fun"" because of the many combinations available when constructing your reserve and its three ecosystems. For further enjoyment, this edition allows the endstate of every game to be saved for later analysis so that you can observe how each player chose to adapt to each game's randomized win conditions as well as what their avian repertoire was.

Most importantly, the gameplay itself is just as sound as the board game. The engine-building/habitat-building is addictive and deep enough so that you'll want to play more and more games. The AI is also challenging enough to keep you occupied even if you don't have friends available to play.

If you never played (in my opinion) it is a less competitive multiplayer game that many people with different age ranges can all play. The best part of the game is the variety in which the cards change ones strategy. Further, the cards can add complexity to the game which can warp into a good mental exercise for ones working memory. However, this random card complexity is also the games biggest drawback as the games own randomness can add to some rather inconsistent winning results. After playing what I amount to many many hours of game play the limit of mastery is reached when the cards themselves leave you feeling a little empty when you sit and play eggs for a whole forth round.

I love the game so I like being able to play even when there's no one around to play with, so I decided to buy the PC version just to make it easier. For the most part, I love it and was planning to write a review with just a couple of suggestions. However, I just played a game against a computer player who played a seemingly impossible move and it's making me more annoyed than it possibly should.

I always keep a close eye on what my opponents are doing when playing in real life, but it's not always easy in the virtual game. In this particular game, it was round 1, and I went first. I didn't notice when my opponent said they kept. On their first turn, they played a bird in their grassland. On their second turn, they played a bird in the wetland. I was interested to see what birds they played back to back so quickly. Imagine my surprise when the birds required three and one food token respectively... Meaning the NPC had four food tokens and two birds to start the game — six things when a player is only allowed to start with five.

Before anyone asks, no, none of the two birds had ""when played"" powers allowing them to pick up extra birds or food tokens when they played (the birds were Red-headed Woodpecker and Ruby-throated Hummingbird). I know this may seem nitpicky but I want a game that simulates the real-life experience of playing Wingspan and giving an NPC the ability to break the rules is not that... In real life at least I could call out an opponent who broke the rules!

I hope the developers see this review and can fix this unfairness. I have screenshots I can share to prove that this happened. Playing with real people online would of course fix this problem but I prefer the speed of playing against the computer.

On an unrelated note, I also would love to see expansion packs made available to mirror the real-life Wingspan expansion packs. I would gladly pay extra for them in that case. Also, when playing against other players online, it is possible for two opponents to have the exact same bird/color, making it impossible to tell who of your opponents were awarded round bonuses.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Unlike Tabletop Simulator, this game is designed to be just one game, so it doesn’t suffer from being a physics simulator. Maybe some people enjoy the rolling dice animations some other games have, but this game doesn’t have it and I’d say it’s a good thing. The game keeps track of all rules for you, so any possible interaction is brought to your attention so you can’t ever say “oops I forgot to activate X ability.”
+ Literally instant set-up and clean up. Duh, it’s a video game, but this makes for a world of difference when actually playing the game and is one of the things I appreciate the most.
+ The sounds, bird calls, voiced trivia, and music are all very appropriate and calming.
+ The limited animation on the bird cards is neat.
+ Tutorial makes learning the game easy. Even if it’s the same as the physical game’s tutorial, it’s implemented well.
+ I haven’t tried the multiplayer, but Steam’s remote play together feature works well if you don’t mind playing with revealed hands.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Not a lot of player interaction so it plays a lot more like a solitaire game. The only cases where other players matter to you is when they take cards from the communal pool, take food from the communal feeder, or trigger abilities that give you resources. It’s very difficult to play around other players’ actions and they don’t feel like they matter a great deal. Maybe some people will like this?
- Like many board games, swingy based on random draws and rolls. Not being able to get a card that you need despite playing the best possible game, or not being able to roll the right food two turns in a row for the feeder despite setting yourself up is not a great feeling. Don’t even get me started on how the raptor cards are literally “roll a 1 on Xd6 to see if you get any extra points.” Most of the time you won’t get anything and can do very little about it. In fact your best odds are 4d6, and that translates to 51.77% chance to get an extra point. Rolling dice in real life can be fun, but I don’t feel that way in a digital game. And a late-game bonus card can either give you 8 points or just never give anything: it's random.

[h1]Meh[/h1]
? Where’s the European expansion as DLC?

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Have you ever wanted to play a board game more than four times? This is how you can do that. Furthermore, birds are very important and this is a great way to look at birds and maybe learn something about them.

I have played the real-life version of Wingspan many times and thoroughly recommend the digital version. Even the soundtrack is amazing! Wingspan is a competitive game, but in a fairly painless way. There is very little player interaction, just competition for resources. 

Both the ""Automa"" (simulating solo play) and the simulated player versions of the A.I. provide a good challenge for even experienced players. So you never have to play against another human unless you want to.

As I write this (less than a week after the game officially launched), online play is restricted to three human players--no more, no less--if you're not playing a custom online game with invited friends. 

Wingspan offers a lot of opportunities for fun and strategic thinking. Though the other players ""thinking about strategy"" at length can sometimes make online games take a lot of time. 

Since I've written this review, the developers have added a ""hard"" more to the A.I. play. They have also added a weekly Automa challenge where you can compete against the top-scorer in the world (a.k.a. the Champ of the Birds) in the same Automa game. You can play that same Automa game over and over to improve your score. The cards and decks are the same each time in the Automa challenge game.

The way this game wants you to play it is awkward and inefficient. You can see one habitat at a time. Thus, you have a limited view of your board state at any one time, and it unnecessarily takes multiple keystrokes to just look at another row of (up to) five cards. On a small screen, this is frustrating. On a larger screen, it's inexcusable. The space is just wasted.

Happily, you're given options and there's a decent strategy view that works pretty well. You still cannot see all the relevant information on your own board at the same time, however a single keystroke provides the next best thing. That keystroke, as far as I can tell, is determined by the developer, with no in-game means to change the keybindings. This is a disgrace for a PC game (and is frustrating if you, like me, use a nonstandard keyboard layout). Fortunately, you lose little time by using mouse inputs. Viewing cards in hand is nightmarish if you build up a large enough hand. This needs immediate attention.

Viewing other players' boards is cumbersome. It's definitely not a priority most of the time, in most games, but it's frustrating to go out of my way to do something that I do by just looking at a different board in real life. Thankfully, this isn't a deal-breaker due to the nature of the game, but when it comes up, it's noticeable.

Multiplayer is messy. There is one mode where a game is completed in one sitting and another which allows 24 hours per turn. The latter needs players to be from similar time zones to avoid becoming cumbersome, however this feature is not present as far as I can tell. Thus, if you're paired with people from drastically different time zones (an inevitability for some people), then you won't have fun with this. The other game mode works well enough most of the time, but I've had some glitches arise that have broken games. I've seen some negative reviews here on the basis of the multiplayer, and if online play were a major concern for me, I could see myself hating this adaptation. As it stands, I'm happy with a decently difficult AI (though I'm not sure that's present either).

Clearly, there are a LOT of flaws. It just so happens that there are straightforward ways around them or they are mostly in areas that I don't much care about. At the end of the day, I have a good time playing Wingspan because there's just enough leeway in the design for me to be thinking about the game rather than the interface 90% of the time. Ultimately, the experience is enjoyable, even if the execution is manifoldly flawed. Thus, I can recommend this adaptation to those who enjoy the board game and who, like me, are primarily interested in the single player experience.",1606446585,1606446585,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'm almost speechless, when it comes to this game. It is just a special place of its own. It is a very relaxing game as well. You find yourself engrossed with collecting the birds. There is plenty of challenge, and especially with multiplayer. You have to play it to see for yourself. I own the board game and expansion table top board game versions as well as the Steam video game format, and spend a lot of time with both. The cards are great to have on the boardgame version, but I think the video actually does this game even better. 

[b]Why?[/b]
1. Bird Sounds: Calls, songs, trivia, etc. make it such a great experience.
2. The Bird Encyclopedia: You can click between the birds listening to the sounds, and sort them by features.
3. Visual movement of birds adds much to the experience. 

The only thing missing from the video version is the Latin names, which are printed underneath the Common name on each of the cards in the Board Game version.

One small issue that I hope gets fixed is the game does not save my preferences. I like that there are different game board backgrounds and avatars to choose from though! I just wish I didn't have to change it for every game. The game defaults to one of the two round goal scoring techniques so I have to change that for each game, too.  (EDITED) A recent patch has made it possible to return to the same game avatar settings but the goal mat still has to be reset each time.

Oh, and if I am choosing a card from my hand to play, the cards are  a bit spastic. They could be a tad less sensitive.

The Discord community for this game is like being in a bird club. Some very interesting things to learn there.

However, Wingspan is not what he was expecting, but a beautifully illustrated complex and simple multi-resource card engine game using birds as the theme. Teaching him how to play with the hard copy was difficult.
However, this version simplifies many of the back-end mechanics, and improves the game flow greatly. 
Building your birding preserve starts and evolves from powers, with potent combinations offset by point values for the endgame. You can change up your approach if needed, and plan for the entire game from your first selections. 

It's a very zen game, and you get to hear birdsong as your board develops, along with learning more about the birds themselves.

I bought in on a lark (har har; for more bad bird puns check the game's achievements) when it was on sale because I wanted a relaxing, turn-based, strategic game to play. Bonus points for being about building or exploration instead of fighting. Wingspan checks all those boxes.

Wingspan's mechanics are solid, and anyone who has played a deck-builder like Dominion or Race for the Galaxy will recognize at least some of the core gameplay loop (limited actions per turn, acquiring cards, building up victory points, etc). There are some wrinkles to the formula, however. For example:

- Instead of disrupting your opponents, there are some cards that help your opponents (often worth lots of points or with effects that are also powerful for you) or which benefit from actions your opponents take.

- Acquiring points actually goes hand in hand with improving your ability to have more impactful turns, as filling our your ""wildlife preserve"" lets you get more resources from the preserve.

- There are multiple places you can play birds, and some can be played to multiple places (or even moved between, in a few rare cases), meaning there's lots of interesting decision making about what to improve first.

- Randomized mini-goals along the way during the game push you towards certain strategies each game, without being so essential that you have to meet them to win (you can safely skip at least some of them if they don't fit the cards you have).

- Additionally, hidden personal objective cards give you other goals to work towards.

Ultimately, from a mechanical standpoint, the game is about maximizing your per-turn point gain, just like in a game like Dominion. Where Wingspan really shines, though, at least in my opinion, is in the art and flavor of the game. Now, I wouldn't call myself a birder per se, but I have a more than passing interest in birds and do have more than one ID book at home which I use with some regularity, especially in the bird-full spring out here in the American Midwest. Wingspan lovingly portrays a great many birds I'm familiar with and quite a few I don't know much about. There's not a ton of information on each bird, but there is a bit of trivia (with voice acting, even) for each one, and I appreciate the ways in which the birds' abilities are inspired by or related to their real life habits and behaviors.

In addition to its enjoyable flavor, Wingspan has chill, relaxing music (though you'll get through it and start hearing it repeat pretty quickly), a reasonably well-written tutorial, a welcome ability to save the results of your games, and good pacing. It's perfect for destressing after a tough day, or for a quick session if you have ~30 minutes to spend.

I haven't really played with friends yet, but I imagine that multiplayer is fun. The AI is unexceptional (I can already trounce the ""normal AI"" pretty much every game, though I do have a lot of experience with this style of game so your mileage may vary), but there's an automated solitaire mode that is more challenging, as well as a ""hard AI"" currently in beta that it seems will be refined over time. Of course, since there's little player-to-player interaction the AI is only of secondary importance. Even against opponents the game is, to some degree, a solo experience anyway. And it's a good one.

I'm usually pretty hesitant to buy board games on Steam because often they're mediocre ports of games that are unenjoyable without other human players. I'm glad I gave Wingspan a chance, because it works marvelously as a relaxing and thoughtful single-player experience.",1606277595,1606278484,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game's release is essentially a beta test. I know that the game did have an actual beta test, which they decided to end, wrongly. Despite the bugs and regular crashes, if you wish to play vs. AI or Automa, the game itself is a decent representation of the board game. It's when we get into the multi-player arena that the game falls flat.

The community keeps asking for the same features and the devs remain silent as to whether, or not, the suggestions will be implemented. They do have the time to add a useless ""weekly challenge mode"" rather than improve the actual game. There are currently two ways that you can play online. You can invite friends and other players (by user name) to a game or you can queue up for a three player game with 5 minute or asych 24 hour turns. No customization, no lobby to see who else is looking, or open a table for others to join. No chat feature to organize said games, you need to rely on Discord and the same handful of players to get those games together.

It uses a horrible ""karma"" system that gives you one point of karma if you finish a quick-start 3 player game with the 5 minute turns, probably asynch games too - but I never play those. If you quit the game or drop due to the many bugs, you lose five points of karma. Karma is capped at 100 and you are supposedly matched with players of your same karma range.I don't know if the player base is large enough for this to really work. If a player drops, there is no way to continue with an AI filling only the dropped player's spot. You can either complete the game or finish it with all AI opponents... and you get no karma, even if you finish the game. If you play a game with people that you scrounged up on the Discord, you get no karma. So many times people will just quit mid-game, sometimes even in the fourth round.

There is also no display to how many cards each player is holding. Information that is critical to some game decisions and seemingly simple to implement. At the start of the game, you can't see what cards you have to choose from until the player before you selects what they wish to keep. So, in a 4 or 5 player game, you could be sitting there for 10-15 minutes just waiting, with nothing to do. Is there any sort of ELO or stat based ranking to track player performance/improvement? Nope. 

The overall presentation of the game looks like it is developed for an app or game console, not a PC. I really want to see this game succeed, but the developers seem to not be listening to our feedback. The game is playable and enjoyable to an extent, but it needs a LOT of work, especially in the multi-player areas.",1604317795,1605069234,False,5,0,0.491041958332061768,0,True,False,False

Quibbles:
- Like to see more genuine ecological learning embedded
The game rewards stacking species in habitats.  Game doesn't explain.
The bonus cards reward multiple species of similar characteristics.  Game doesn't explain.
Future Projects:
Add a layer of food ecology.  Eg. More grain grows -> more rats -> more likely raptor cards draw
Add a habitat restoration investment.  Eg. Reclaim forests -> more likely tree birds draw
Dreaming Out Loud:
A Long Game, with birds, food ecology, habitat restoration, and extinction penalties for rare species

The offline mode works very well and I have yet to run into any bugs there.

In the online mode though it's a whole other story for me. There is a turn timer of 5 minutes in the mode I'd like to play if it worked. The problem though is that there is a bug where you see an opponent's timer run out time when it's in fact my turn. It has happened on multiple occations now that I have timed out and lost games while thinking it's another players turn. To handle this I've been forced to close the game in between rounds for it to refresh properly, which means I'm forced to restart the game about 50 times a game to make sure It's indeed not my turn when the game states it's my opponents turn. If you play this game offline it's recommended for sure.

This is exactly what I needed to get into it, though. The tabletop version costs around $40 USD most places, but the digital version is half the price. If you can get a local group together, or get some people to play through something like Parsec, this game is a blast. 
The translation to a digital format is wonderful; the music is very nice and relaxing, the visuals and little animations are really fun to look at each time you place down a card and the bird trivia is so fun to listen to. 
             From a gameplay perspective, this game is absolutely a joy to play. If you're a fan of management, you'll probably like this. There's no time limits for turns so you can spend as long as you'd like going about planning. Games can be on the lengthy side, even with just 2 players so despite having almost 10 hours in this, I think I've only played about 10-12 games in total; most of which were with my girlfriend. We're long distance and we tend to just call each other for most of the day when we can. For about a week after I got her to play a match with me, she would often ask me to play the game with her every time we started calling for about a week. 
            The game has a fair bit to keep track of, but the U.I. is readable and the game takes about as long to explain as most tabletop games do. Learning which birds synergize with specific habitats is the most fun part of this game for me, as figuring out the best way to start setting up your habitats depending on the types of birds you have in your hand is really engrossing. Overall just a really fun digital version of a board game that I now would like to buy for real sometime soon. 

You can play online with up to 5 people, and if they don't feel they want to pay, you can always just paly over something like Parsec or remote play. Good game.

My scoring average is very close to 80 points, with the AI getting, on average, about 67 points.

There is enough strategy here to make each game unique, and entertaining. I have yet to use the same cards twice, given the 170 different birds.

I normally play between 8 and 12 birds, and the possible combinations MUST be in the billions. 

Each match starts with a bonus card..two are displayed, one is chosen. This will DIRECTLY affect the starting cards you take..you want to get a good start at earning the end of game bonuses. For this reason, the starting bonus card will force you to go a certain direction. It may be that you need all big birds..likely wetlands birds. The wetlands birds, normally, will result in a large number of bird cards in your hand. This in turn would mean focusing on food production to be a secondary priority, with just enough egg production needed to place the birds.

There are an enormous number of synergies and inter-relationships between cards. After 49 matches, I don't feel that I have even scratched the surface of the available combos.

I'm writing this review as a person who's played the board game in real life (IRL), so I can definitively say that this product does not mimic that experience when playing solo.  I'd love to comment on the online gameplay aspect, but I can't seem to get matchmaking to work AND as long as we're on that topic, let's do a quick breakdown of the flaws in online games:

1. No settings to adjust/customize (i.e. How many players, how long a turn should be, etc.)
2. Players drop frequently after you've waited 5 minutes for them to take a turn (5 minutes is the default turn length) and are replaced by an AI (see below on AI game play) unless you choose to abandon the game
3. You cannot see other players' names or avatars until they actually take a turn, so you have no idea who's in your game until they do something (frustrating due to the other issues such as inviting friends)
4. As others have stated, there's issues with inviting your friends to play, you must invite ""players"" instead of inviting friends from your friends list...huh?!

Solo Content:

The AI does not play the same game you play, this fact is astonishing to me (and frankly, smacks of lazy programming)!  The AI has a VERY basic set of actions each round, which in the 3 games I played before requesting a refund, consist of:  Flipping cards down on the table, Flipping cards up on the table, and laying eggs (I think, not super clear).  The AI gets points continuously for any of these actions.  Further, the cards it plays have nothing what-so-ever to do with the end-of-round goals (where points are awarded), yet it still makes progress toward them nearly every turn which is unrealistic and unfair.  

Alternatively, players are limited to scoring using the cards they have in hand, their accumulated resources (i.e. eggs and tucked cards), and the cards they can collect from the deck.  Players must utilize what they have (which in many cases results in slow-build point-scoring) to score using the traditional game rules/mechanics (points are not always accumulated on each turn like the AI).

I found that the computer AI set on NORMAL difficulty was able to beat me 3 out of 3 times (insert your best ""git gud"" comments here) despite my using different techniques/strategies based on my hand, while it enjoyed carefree point hoarding based on seemingly nothing and no strategy in particular.  This method of ""AI"" programming is akin to nothing more than setting up a counter and watching it go up each round to simulate a player who always seems to be better than you no matter the circumstances--the bottom line is it's maddening and doesn't emulate the board game experience at all!

Until the above issues are addressed, I cannot give this game a thumbs up.  I have to imagine that many of the positive ratings are coming from people who are either not having problems with the online matchmaking, or whom have never played the board game IRL.",1602066694,1602066694,False,35,4,0.703363239765167236,1,True,False,False

I can say that, having not played the physical version, I can imagine and understand that this experience won't be the same, the screen might look overloaded with info at first, or maybe maybe scrolling through your habitats and other player's views is not the best.

This adaptation fundamentally works, and has been well worth my money and my play, but it's still got a number of problems and shortcomings.

First, the UI design was ill-conceived. The developers spent most of their time creating displays for individual habitats, with all kinds of cute animations and sounds, and they're fundamentally unusable because they require you to play while seeing just a third of your board. Fortunately, the designers (in what looks like an afterthought) created an alternate display that lets you see the whole board, albeit without all the bells and whistles; it's the only way to play the game. Still, you have to flip a button to see what your birds do, and there's very little indication of how the other players are doing, so there are still other shortcomings. 

The one other UI issue is that it's quite difficult to select individual cards when you have a large hand. You'd think that card selection would be a known technology, but not here.

Second, the AI is terrible. Terrible as in, it's never won in my two-player or three-player games it's only managed second place a time or two. It obviously doesn't try at all to reach the end-round goals. I don't know what else it ignores. Fundamentally, it's broken. The only reason the game remains fun for solo play is that the original designers created an ""automata"", which is kind of a randomized score to play against. Play a game with one automata and one AI and you'll have one competitive score to beat and one really dumb player to mess up the food and birds for you (as you'd like to have happen in this sort of game). I suppose you could go five-player: an AI managed a win there, but that's because of the additional chaos, and you don't really want to sit around waiting for all those AIs.

Third, the publisher thus far hasn't covered themselves in glory. Their first patch was so badly QAed that it broke the game for many players on Macs for a few nights. I've also hit numerous bugs, including a total hang, a card going missing on an undo, and pink powers going off double.

So, this is a good game, but thus far it's in spite of the computer developers. Improvements to the AI and some attention to the UI that's actually the one you need to use would make all the difference, but as is I feel like I bought a game that wasn't finished.

Overall outstanding adaptation of one of my favorite 'engine' board games.  All the cards and game elements are wonderfully realized and really come to life with added animations and descriptions along with the proper bird-calls etc.  

The only real concern I have is it can be challenging to see a solid 'summary' screen showing all the public game elements, instead they chose to chop them up into a number of sub-screens, which is ok-ish if you already know your next move, but it does mean you need to constantly cycle through the sub-screens to know the current dice, and available public birds, which is less than ideal.

All of that is important information on those screens but I would still like the ability to 'overview' everything and unfortunately while there is one 'board' view that lets you see *your* 3 sub-screens worth of info together very much like the actual game boards do, it doesn't surface the public birds and bird-feeder status currently.  Hopefully a future update can fix this.

That one gripe aside pretty much every other aspect of the presentation is really outstanding and its a very fun game to play once you get the basic rules and play-pattern of your ever-growing bird-engine down and can flow through it quickly with friends.",1601623745,1601623774,True,6,0,0.622641503810882568,0,True,False,False

The implementation is lacking a few ways. The UI seems to have been targeted for a casual market but it is obviously not a casual price. And the UI is unsatisfying for more seasoned players. There is inadequate information about what other players do on their turns. In many games you get to see what they do as if they were doing it in the UI. Instead the only feedback you get is what action they took and if there are any out of turn things you have to respond to on your next turn. A log of actions would also be nice. Additionally it would be nice if some information about the other players was in the main view instead of having to check their board. Like number of birds in each habitat, how many eggs they have in play, what the leaders are in the categories. All of these could be shown with icons/numbers adjacent to each of these areas.

The community o discord is great and there are usually people looking for a game (if you prefer not to use the quick match).

Highly recommend this family friendly game, great for all ages (young children might struggle a little with the rules), but with some adult help and practice they should pick it up. You can play with up to five human players on the one copy of the game, or you can play with up to four other A.I controlled players and yourself in single player or try your luck with multiplayer (as of right now there is no communication method in multiplayer, so for younger children you do not need to worry about that part of the internet).

The gameplay is genuinely compelling with several polished mechanics working together and it's truly commendable how compelling learning about birds and their habitats becomes with this game. But the game itself has several shortcomings where the implementation doesn't carry the concepts involved. 

The big one: it crashes. Every now and then, a game cannot be continued (despite saves after every turn), because it will keep crashing. It's a bit unfortunate, but it's very rare. It is possible to overcome this.

This game could learn a great deal from other card games out there. First of all, the UI is horrendous. After about 4 cards, you can no longer reliably see or select the cards, let alone see the important attributes at a glance. There's also no UI scaling option, so you're stuck with a game designed for half blind centenarians sitting on the opposite side of the room. As many good strategies revolve around card advantage, this makes playing well an exercise in frustration.  Furthermore, it has three habitats, which is nice, but there's no real reason to have them on separate screens. Especially as there are several abilities which require you to distribute objects (like eggs) globally. 

As for the mechanics, there are two problems. First, there's no way to mulligan. This means that if you don't draw any powering cards, like those that allow you to get extra cards/food/eggs, you're at a major disadvantage. It's the equivalent as drawing a hand of only 7+ cards in Hearthstone. You're not about to win that game unless a miracle happens.

Secondly, the UI makes it very difficult to follow what other players are doing. Yes, you can see everything, but that's a large number of clicks, and you better remember everything correctly, as the game only aggregates a few things, usually things related to goals. But the main problem is, there's almost no way to interact with other players. I would have thought that a predator could eat their birds, but you can only interact via positives. There are many cards that give you resources when others do a specific thing. But, while they can be good, it won't help you catch up to a runaway player with a good start. 

I'm very much tempted to recommend this game anyway for the beautiful art and music, and the many hours of enjoyment that you can gain from this, but the port to PC isn't finished enough, and I cannot bring myself to support an industry that makes semi-broken products on the basis of boardgame IP.",1601032915,1601032915,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you think the AI isn't challenging enough, start playing against the Automa. If that's too easy for you (which is honestly challenging for the majority at 90+ points per match), then play against people and wait.  

The karma system will level out how long you're waiting, as you play with more experience people. It's honestly not bad, I probably waited 1 min on average, and at most 2 minutes per person when I play online.

Sure, you can't see what the other players are doing all the time, but you can just look over at their side of the board.  Yes, players do get 5 minutes for their turn, which can lead up to 10 minutes of sitting - but that's the same with a real board game, just normally you're visually stimulated by the other players moving.

Second, the visuals are just lovely, though I don't really understand some of the design choices (why would anyone choose to view just their Forest?), and I'd like to be able to watch the other players or AIs take their turns.

That doesn't mean this version isn't without it's problems, which isn't surprising so shortly after launch. I'm not sure what the rationale was for giving so many viewing options, but I only use the ""full board"" view (rather than viewing each of the environments), which requires a click to view powers of birds that have been played. The interface is very click-heavy to avoid making mistakes and to fix misclicks, which I appreciate, but if you have more than a couple birds in your hand (say 5+ total cards), selecting and playing birds from your hand is SUPER clunky and finicky. Since the game is a bit pricey, none in my gaming group have bought it yet, so I've only played the AI, which is pretty easy (no Hard AI has been implemented yet), but still very fun. In my last game I won 115-71-61-51, so it was a rout against the regular AI, but that was my biggest win to date.

The AI is also slow (a single player game against 3 AIs takes about an hour), but I imagine that will be fixed in future updates. Automa has also been implemented, which was a surprise. It's harder than the AI, but less fun than playing the full game.

Highly recommended if you love the board game. If you're new to the game, know that this game looks a bit complicated, but it's really very easy, and you'll be an expert after the first playthrough. Just four options on any turn, and lots of ways to score points.

To start with, it doesn't even include the European expansion, which came out nearly a year ago.  The online play is spotty at best, downright poor at worst.  Want to play an online game against strangers, sure at up to 5 mins per turn.  That makes the game way too long.  Want to play against 1, 3 or 4 strangers, sorry you only get the option of a 3 player game.  Want to just play the computer, sure except the AI seems a bit off even on normal so it doesn't feel realistic.

And don't get me started with the 9/23 update which can make your game unplayable.  Nothing like losing karma because you had to quit a game because a pink power popup won't leave the screen.  Also don't go on their discord board and let them know that they've screwed up and to fix the game or you will get a message from a mod saying you're using abusive language.  I'm guessing the developers and admins only want to hear good things in their unicorn and lollipop world.

The only redeeming part of this game would be playing against friends only that you can invite to a game.  This can be helpful when they're far away, you're stuck in a snow storm, or if you're unfortunate enough to have to quarantine.   Of course it would be nice to be able to play with European expansion included, even if it cost more.

There are ways to play Wingspan on PC already through various boardgame engines like Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia, so this version really needed to justify both existing at all and being, at $20, more than twice as much the TTS mod. Thankfully, it does that and more by adding a great AI that's challenging even on the easy setting, online play, the solo mode, and a couple variations on the rules that can be toggled. It's also far and away the best looking of the ways to play Wingspan, with some great painted backgrounds for each biome and recorded calls when you click on bird cards. It won't replace the board game for me, but it's a great way of getting a quick game in by yourself or when your group doesn't have the time or space to set up the real thing. Highly recommended.

- UI
- Usability (I hope for an alt mode that allows to play in the overview mode and an easy way to see other players boards together, not only one by one…)
- Start is bad, game kind of suggest you should select birds and food first, bonus cards later. Obvisouly you should take both into consideration, but the UI makes this pretty uncomfortable to do
- No custom portraits, premade ones get overlayed with player color which looks kind of weird
- Multiplayer: Gets disconnected quite often & is very slow (5 minutes for each turn, takes forever, longer than physical game).
- Multi: You can have multiple games at once but there is no easy way to switch between them, makes it very tedious
- Multi: No real matchmaking (e.g. ELO), only Karma, not skill taken into consideration

It is totally worth buying even if you own the original, if only for the fact that here you can also hear what sounds the birds make. The digital version obviously cannot amaze us with the fantastic paper texture of the board game; however, the interface is really beautiful and I find it comfortable. The game even offers customization, with different habitat boards and avatars to choose from. The bird facts are now read by a narrator, which is great, although I am not really a fan of the American voice-over, and so far there are only three languages to choose for audio (English, Polish and Mandarin Chinese; there are 11 languages for text alone). Fortunately for Polish speakers, the PL voice-over is fantastic and sounds like our classic nature documentaries.

The game offers both the Automa mode and a regular match against AI. Of course, problems with people quitting online games can be expected, and I have seen people complaining about it. I do not ask for much in this category, though. I am just glad the game offers asynchronous gameplay – it can be fantastic if you have friends to play it online with, people that you know will not quit.

I also like that the game lets you save a finished game into the Preserve Archive. It is always satisfactory to immortalise all those boards filled with cards set up during games.

- Beautiful relaxing game
- Reasonable price
- Cross-play
- Great controller support

- Bugs and UX issues throughout the game. Rarely are these game breaking, but they add an element of frustration to an otherwise relaxing game.
- Multiplayer matchmaking isn't quite there yet. I have tried to start 4 ""slow"" games (24 hour per turn) and each time someone has not played in time or errored out (this happened to myself too).

I'm by no means a board games aficionado and was introduced to Wingspan by friends. If I hadn't played the ""real"" version before it would've been really hard to get into. Yet, even if you're struggling at the beginning, this game is a pure gem. You can play this game for hours every day without getting bored.

The PC-adaptation is extremely well-made, considering how complex the board game itself is. A few things could be improved, such as always showing the feeder, no matter which habitat you're currently in, or showing all 3 drawable cards if you're in green or yellow, too. Still, I'd rate it a 10/10 from a UX experience while in a game.

Game-theory-wise, this game has a few very overpowered cards (hello Ravens and Kildeer) which can make you snowball extremely. They should probably get nerfed, but I'm not good enough of a player to give in-depth feedback on balance. Other than that, there are many strategies to explore in Wingspan and honestly, it's just super fun, which is exactly what it should be.

The online mode is a bit weird and sometimes buggy, but nothing too special. It's not perfect, but other players will surely provide better critique than I am able to give.",1600630517,1600630517,True,5,0,0.563780605792999268,0,True,False,False

Once I went through each review and found out that there actually are people that have encountered the same issues, I wanted to refund, but was already too late. I want to love this iteration of Wingspan, but trying to play online is too much for me.

There are too much issues with online multiplayer, UI and bugs to recommend this in its current state. If you want to play Wingspan in online multiplayer, just look at Tabletopia or Tabletop Simulator. 

This game seems to be targeted towards an audience that wants to play Wingspan board game in single player with bots and pretty visuals.

Pros: 
* Voice acting plays for description of bird once its played.
Cons:
* Bad Online Multiplayer. Says in menu 5 minutes per turn but actually is 2. Once somebodies turn times out, the whole lobby is closed, they cannot return and other players need to find a new game. If you did not finish your turn in time for some reason, you lose 5 ""karma"" points. You get only 1 back if you complete a whole game. I have lost a lot by accident, either not noticing the timer went out or there was an issue with connection (have 800 mbps on speedtest, not sure what is the issue)
* You cannot look at your birds/bonus objectives at the beginning of game when other players are choosing what to keep.
* There is a ""birds"" section in main menu. I wanted to look at some birds that I could possibly find in games, but you can see only the birds you have ""discovered"" already in game. Not sure why there is such feature for a multiplayer board game.
* 70% of UI is redundant/clunky. Whole game can be played in the 30% of ""Habitat overview"" view, but even then its painful to switch between top and bottom parts of card texts. Other part way is just switching between each Habitat, you see the whole lane in all screen, but nothing really of value is added in this, IMO.
 
Bugs I encountered:
1. I played a bird on 2 egg spot, but when I was requested to select the eggs, I noticed I am lacking 1. Then I started to check other player boards to change strategy, but once back at my board, the bird was gone - not on my board and not in the hand.
2. First round scoring was ""Most eggs on birds in water habitat"". My turn was last for whole round, I laid 2 eggs, which appeared on the board, but was still scored 0 eggs. Not sure if I somehow misunderstood the goal or was it a bug.
3. I won my first online multiplayer game that did not crash. At the end of game, there was an option offered to save the game in ""archives"", which I used. Once I checked in the archive section in main menu, there were no games saved.",1600623797,1600624376,False,8,0,0.593245625495910645,0,True,False,False

The game looks great, as does its physical game, but here I feel like the UI focuses too much on trying to look nice and stylish and loses some functionality. It could have been solved by allowing you to fully play in the overview view that they give you but they chose to just leave that as an overview rather than a playable view option. Unfortunate and the game suffers slightly from it but not enough to turn this bird game into a bird shame. With that being said as having played the physical game no tutorial was needed and it took me only a few minutes to wrap my head around things and hit the ground running.

A lot of the ""Not recommended"" reviews have encountered gamebreaking bugs.  I have not encountered any of those.  

Many also talk about the 5-minute timer for online games.  I tend to agree that that is way too long.  It turns what should be an hour or less game into a much longer slog.  I also don't like that you are stuck with only 3 player.  Customizable lobbies would be great, where people can set the time limits and player counts themselves.

Also, What is the automa?  An explanation of what this type of AI is would be great, if it's explained somewhere, I have not found it.  

The AI games are the way to go if you want more or less than 3 players and don't want to spend hours on one game.  They run smoothly and offer a good experience.  

Overall a fun digital version of the tabletop game.  With a few tweaks, I think it will be even better.

The multiplayer aspect of this game is completely broken. Unless you're content to play against the AI, do not buy this game.

To play against strangers, the only options you have are to join a random 5-minute-per-move game (which is way too much for a live game), or to join a random 24-hour-per-move game (which for many people is not long enough for an asynchronous game). Oh, and you can't control the number of players in your games with strangers -- it's 3 player games only. Want to play a game with 4 players, or 5, or go mano-a-mano? Too bad, you can't.

When creating a game for friends, if you use the ""invite a friend"" feature to reserve a spot for them, they won't see your game. You have to use the ""invite a player"" feature in order for the game to be visible. So ""invite a player"" = good, ""invite a friend"" = does nothing. Cool.

In game, you can't see anyone's name unless it is their turn, and (most bizarrely of all) there is no chat in either the online lobby or within the game.

It's tragic because the actual implementation of the board game is very well done. But at the end of the day, this is a digital adaptation of a resource management board game. It's not unreasonable to think that the primary reason most people will buy this game is to play against other humans. To that end, shipping the game with a multiplayer UX that looks like it was slapped together in one weekend by an unpaid intern and then not tested by literally anybody is simply inexcusable.

I chastise not only the developers for releasing such an inadequate product, but also the fans who validated the developers' decision to sell a $20 game missing core features by leaving positive reviews.

Look at Through the Ages. That multiplayer UX is nothing flashy, but it works exactly how you'd expect. I can create a game and choose a range of times from 2 minutes per move to 3 days per move. I can reserve spots for random people or for my friends, and if I reserve for my friends, they'll see it in the online lobby. I can easily control the number of players in a game I create or in a game I choose to join. I can easily see the names of the people I'm playing against at all times, and I can chat with them. 

The Through the Ages app came out three years ago. These are basic features. There is no excuse for today's digital board game developers to release a game without them. I sincerely hope the devs patch in a better multiplayer UI as time goes along, and if they do, I will change this review. Right now, taking $20 for a multiplayer game without functional multiplayer is nothing short of unconscionable.",1600493170,1600544392,False,149,7,0.782452523708343506,5,True,False,False

What is Wingspan? An extremely popular, competitive, lightweight engine builder.

At first glance this game does seem rather complex to new players (as I've had the joy of teaching this game to a few people already). But in reality falls down to completing 1 of 4 actions on each of your turns:
Placing a bird, feeding, laying eggs or drawing cards. Over the course of 4 rounds total. The player with the most points at the end of the 4 rounds wins.

As the game begins, you choose between 1 out of 2 randomly drawn goal cards, alongside a choice of which combination of 1 of each food token and 5 randomly drawn birds cards (to a total of 5, birds and food) you would like to keep in your initial hand. 

From there each round has a randomly drawn objective which you can aim to score additional points. Each player then takes 1 action (Play, Feed, Lay eggs or Draw cards) each turn until each play has taken all their actions for the round.

And that's pretty much gameplay in a nutshell. 

There is a ton of replayability in the game, as the base game comes with 170 bird cards. Each game the bird cards, goal cards and food dice are shuffled/rolled to produce random results so no 2 games ever play out the same!

The visuals are unlike anything I've seen for a digital version of a board game, and I own many here on Steam. And it is simply a joy to behold, even though I will admit for first time players it may be overwhelming. But the more you play the easier it is to associate what all the icons are and how to play, The sounds are also delightful as it has nice, calm ambient sound and birds chirping away in the background.

Overall a very fun and enjoyable game. Well worth the asking price!

Pros:
- Wonderful artwork
- You can learn bird calls as you play by clicking on the birds
- If you know how to play Wingspan already, it's very easy to get the hang of
- Does math for you and prompts for your birds powers so you never miss something that might be activated by another player

Cons:
- You cannot see other player's activity during their turn. It tells you that they laid eggs or put a bird out and where, but you do not get to see them using their bird powers such as spending eggs to draw cards, tuck cards, etc...
- Player cards are split into three different screens making it so you constantly have to scroll up and down through different screens during your turn. There is an over view screen, but it's not very helpful.
- Seems to have a few bugs and crashed on me once forcing me to force close the program and restart, but the game was still there when I came back.

The music is delightful and the game is BEAUTIFUL. There's very well-recorded voice over of the 'flavour text' on all the cards about the birds that are read out when you play them. The UI takes a little getting used to but is well-featured with a lot of information available once you get the hang of it.

I've been playing the board game for several months and was looking forward to this videogame version. It did not disappoint! It includes all the game play details of the original, plus fun details - the birds move and sing, and a narrator provides a fun fact about each bird (you can disable this feature if you want).

The gist of this game is that you have a wildlife preserve made of wetland, grassland and woodland, and you need to fill it with birds, get them to lay eggs, and make other moves to maximize your score. This game provides countless ways to win - do you try to play as many small birds as possible? Large birds? Lay lots of eggs?  No two games are alike - a strategy that may work well in one game may not work as well the next time you play.

Some caveats - this is not an easy board game to learn how to play, but there are good tutorials available. I came into the videogame with high knowledge of the mechanics of the game. It may be harder for a newbie to pick up some strategies. I'd advise you to just play it for the fun of it and gradually learn how to strategize.

[h2]Summary[/h2]
Game is gorgeous. Music is very relaxing.  UI is very smooth and intuitive.  It took me few turns to get my bearing but after that, it was good. Also, haven't played the board game for a while but it came back quickly. That's telling you how much the UI was well-think of. It does not feel like a cheap digital version of the board game.  There's a lot of quality (thus time and effort) that was put into this application.  So, it's worth the price.

[h2]Positive Aspects[/h2]
- UI / UX - [u]Amazing, REALLY[/u]. They maximized the symbols over text so it's VERY intuitive. There's small animations, very colorful.
- Music (loving it).
- There's a cancel button before committing your actions
- In addition to the habitats, theyre's a board view (bottom one, brown) - Once you get your bearing, you'll play with this view a lot
- When you choose your goal, they give you a % of the cards (useful)

[h2]Possible improvements[/h2]
- FIRST - Let's be clear, it's [b]99% perfect[/b], thus I called this section ""possible improvements""
- On the board view, when looking your cards in hands, it takes a bit of space thus less easy to deploy birds
- Again, on the board view, i would like to be able to see the card powers. For example, right click on the card and you see the full card. I did not find any way (except changing into other habitats)
- I'm not used to the AUTOMA so I don't (yet) understand its moves

It's a good implementation and many reviewers have indicated what they like, so I'll just share a few issues that I found, which wouldn't stop me from buying or playing it again (and that I'll report to the developers):

- Bird feeder contents should be visible at all times, not only when viewing the Forest habitat and player boards
- Face up cards from the draw pile should be visible at all times, not only when viewing the Wetland habitat and player boards
- An indicator of card placement in habitats by other players (such as a thumbnail view of player boards) should be visible at all times, not only when viewing player boards
- When an AI player is taking a turn, human players should be able to navigate through views as they can when a human player is taking a turn
- Past player actions should be visible in a turn log, in case a player doesn't see the notifications displayed at the start of their turn
- If a player is unable to perform an action, they should be notified more clearly.  For example, I played a bird card with the power to immediately play a second bird card, but I didn't have the 2 eggs required to play a second card.  Not realizing that, I tried clicking to place a second card, then tried clicking in another habitat, etc. and eventually gave up and clicked the End Turn button.  It was a few moments later that I realized why I had been unable to place a second bird (insufficient eggs), but obviously the game knew that already, so why not just tell me ""you can't use that power now"" in the same way that it automatically skips over brown power activations when they are invalid?
- Not sure if this is a bug or feature request, but I'm running the Mac version on Mojave, and I'm finding that the pointer sensitivity is too high when I've got maybe 6+ cards in my hand: as the mouse pointer moves horizontally, the target area for each card is very small.  Similarly, when I'm trying to select a card to place in a habitat, hovering brings the card ""up"" from my hand, but then the mouse pointer is below it - clicking at that point is non-obvious, so I move the pointer up but only the bottom 33% or so of the card is the target area and, if I move up to the middle of the card, it goes back ""down"" into my hand.
- Bird powers that are activated by another player's card are non-obvious to that player.  For example, I've placed a predator bird, and another player has a bird that gets scraps from the bird feeder when a predator is successful.  During my turn and my activation, my predator is successful, and then my turn is paused (for their action to complete) with no visible indicator except the rotating hourglass.

I've played literally hundreds of rounds of the physical version (thanks pandemic!). This port, like so many information-heavy boardgames, has not been translated well to a digital format. It feels like it was optimized for developing a mobile copy at the same time as a desktop copy, and fails both. If you have a lot of time spent on that, this version might frustrate you.

Generally, it feels like the focus was on all the wrong things. Why do all the UI elements float like you're on a boat? Why is the high-level overview (by far the most appealing part of play) feel like an after-thought? Why does everything feel like it takes more clicks and navigation than it should? Why does the Tabletop Simulator version, despite being an awkward physics simulator that takes longer to set up and play, feel more satisfying?

This game does some nice tweaks. It counts upcoming rounds and your standing thereof. It has an undo button (when it applies). It does math for you, as any digital version should. This is especially appreciated when the math changes, such as when you get more potential egg slots and don't want to count each time.

There are just so many things it shouldn't be doing. The music is nice and peaceful yet completely repetitive after 10 minutes. I had to disable it. The voiceover is grating (at least it, too, can be turned off). The confirmation buttons are different depending on context and it's confusing. You can't see your information and your opponents' at the same time. Some UI elements could (and should) be present all the time (such as face-up cards, birdfeeder food, pink cards on opponent boards, etc), but instead there is just a lot of wasted space. 

There's so much cognitive overhead, which is ironic because the game hides so much information, presumably trying to cut down on info overload, and the result is constantly feeling out of the loop. Then, to get that information, you have to wade through a menu-style system instead of something where everything is visible and has drag-and-drop, and the menu is convoluted and requires so much clicking. It's like this game tries to think outside the box but didn't really have any good ideas, but instead of defaulting to what the game actually is in the physical version it sticks with the weird UX choices. Playing is just such a...chore.

On top of all that, it still has some bugs at launch. I'll still play this game because I love the physical version enough to fill in the UX gaps, but this could have been so much better and I can't help but feel disappointed at how overwrought it is instead. I haven't even touched online multiplayer play yet. I don't think I could stomach it.",1600409999,1600409999,False,99,0,0.7419167160987854,0,True,False,False

I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find multiplayer game play and friend game play, but am a bit concerned about the 5 minute time limit between each turn. Having an online game that is turned based seems a bit over the top, but I enjoy the fact that I can play with my friends even when we can't get together to play the real board game. I am highly impressed with the bird artwork and sounds for each bird, I am so happy to have a relaxing game to play! Thank you Stonemaire Games and Monster Couch!",1600362395,1600362395,True,1,0,0.514440715312957764,0,True,False,False

Kudos to the awesome atmosphere which is very chill and birdy and I like the voiceovers.There are some downside to the UI though.  Some clicks don't always register and its not always intuitive or clear where to click or what to do.  As I have played the board game a lot, I was able to figure it out without too much difficulty and now I can fly through it.   I think for brand new players this might be a bit of a hellscape. Overall this is such a great game that it is worth taking the time to learn the interface.",1600362205,1600362205,True,6,0,0.545665383338928223,0,True,False,False
