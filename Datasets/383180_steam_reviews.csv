Although I liked the game, Palanai is half of the fun that was Banoi; I think after the entry scene, everybody knew where the game was leading to.

Pros
• More zombie slashing.
• You can import your character from DI, making the game more challenging from the start.
• A New Playable Character.
• Defending against the horde was entertaining.
• [spoiler]Wrestler Wayne fight was pretty cool[/spoiler].
• Plenty of Lore such as Dr Kessler's casebook.


Cons
• Poor written story.
• Forgetful characters - Where IS SVETI?
• No combat improvement.
• No new weapons.
• No new blueprints.
• No arenas.
• Few new mutations but 99% of the time you fighting Walkers and Infected.
• Shorter game and areas than Dead Island.
• Dead zones felt like filler content.
• [spoiler]Didn't think our hero would inject him/herself with the mutagen to fight Harlow, taking into account he/she was already infected and could have done it.[/spoiler]


Cliffhanger: [spoiler]What happen? Did our hero kill everyone on the boat and continued its rampage? We might never know...[/spoiler]


In my opinion Dead Island Riptide is a ""Dead Island Downgrade"", so if you have to choose between the both, I strongly suggest to get Dead Island; otherwise, killing zombies is always fun and you will get your thirst quenched if you get Dead Island Riptide.

After leaving the holiday island of Banoi, the survivors land by helicopter on a military ship, where they are promptly captured and imprisoned. During the uncomfortable journey through a tropical storm, the frigate runs aground on a reef and strands on a tropical island - and we are forced to fight our way through the same scenario again. The melee and weapon arsenal has been expanded, which overall is a good thing. Great gory fun at first, but otherwise the game plays too quickly like its predecessor and, thanks to little variety, degenerates into pure frustration and hard work later at some point.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] It is basically the same game as the predecessor just at a new location. The gameplay get's stale pretty fast. Head bobbing and fov stutters are way worse than in the predecessor. The upgrading system has been improved slightly.


[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] An additional upgrading path has been added that levels upon using certain equipment
[*] A lot of sidequests wherever you go. Most of them are basically the same, but still believable. Everybody would require mostly the same help in such situation.
[*] Navigation via the minimap is ok in most cases
[*] Hack n Slash works decent
[*] Various weapons and mods that you can apply to ""fake"" diversity
[*] Potential Co-Op
[*] Your rewards from quests and loot scales with your level
[*] Enemies scale with your level - so you can remain in the same area while the loot and xp gains grow
[/list]


[b]Cons:[/b]
[*] Head bobbing and fov lag when you run around can cause motion sickness. It got way worse than in the predecessor.
[*] Voice acting is terrible
[*] Graphics are meh
[*] Character models are disgustingly ugly and the most scary thing in the entire game - no wonder you get attacked non stop
[*] No way to adjust difficulty
[*] Can't zoom out from the map far enough to see the entire map, so you are constantly shifting the map around to search for locations ....
[*] Gunplay is one of the worst I have ever seen
[list]
[*] Upon ADS-ing there is a crazy aimbot on enemies bodies (never their head!) - even through walls
[*] There is an even bigger aimsupport whenever you aim next to enemies, that slows down your mouse movement so that you have to wipe across your entire mousepad to switch from somebody, you are aiming to, to another one that is literally right next to them. Same when you want to correct your ADS-aimbot from chest to head. It is just tedious and unreliable
[*] Not ADS-ing works in close range but later in the game it is required since the weapons are not accurate enough when you don't ADS ...... So you can't compensate it with your own skill. FUN
[*] No way to disable the aimbot and aimsupport
[*] No way to adjust the ADS sensitivity separately

Because just like this one, Dead Island, and Dying Light; all three which are the same game, it gets annoying rather quickly. Realistically, if this was a real zombie apocalypse, we wouldn't wait until we're at a ""certain"" level to use weapons. Yet in this game these weapons are at a certain level, but turn out to be crappy weapons despite the level. To think the devs were the ones to determine which weapons does more damage and which ones doesn't, makes this an annoying game. Nope can't pick it up and use it because you're not at a so and so level. 

Another thing that annoys the fu** out of me is meleeing and/or shooting zombies. Especially those running zombies-- in the face-- it doesn't flinch them at all. Just think in order to kill a zombie, you gotta rely on damage dealt to them, but not only that, the level to do massive damage. RPG type games like this one, are not a good combination. Just saying. It's why CAPCOM will never do an RPG zombie game like Dead Island, Dead Island Riptide, and Dying Light.

The melee range from zombies is ridiculous. Kicking them is generally is useless. They know when to hit you. Lunging zombies have a bit advantage on you, and you will get frustrated.

And I have to say, it did not disappoint. This expansion is a perfect follow-up to the first game, continuing the story of the survivors and adding new elements that keep the game feeling fresh and exciting.

One of the first things that struck me about Dead Island Riptide was the improvements in graphics and gameplay. The graphics are even more stunning than the first game, with vibrant and detailed environments that really immerse you in the zombie-infested island. The gameplay also feels smoother and more polished, making combat and movement feel more fluid and natural.

But what sets Dead Island Riptide apart from the first game is the new island of Palanai. This new location adds a whole new dimension to the game, with different landscapes, dangerous new enemies, and interesting side quests to discover. Exploring this new island is an adventure in itself and adds even more hours of gameplay to an already lengthy game.

The characters from the original game also make a return in Riptide, and their stories continue to evolve in interesting and unexpected ways. It was great to see how they have grown and changed since the events of the first game, and also to meet new characters who bring their own unique flavor to the group dynamic.

One of the things that made the original Dead Island so popular was its open-world, RPG-style gameplay. And this aspect is still present and well-executed in Riptide. The game gives you the freedom to explore, make choices, and improve your character's skills and weapons, making each playthrough a unique and personal experience.

Of course, a game like Dead Island Riptide wouldn't be complete without its signature, gory combat. And once again, the game delivers on this front. The variety of weapons available, from the classic machete to electrified axes, makes for some truly satisfying zombie-slaying action. And the addition of new special infected, like the Screamer and the Boomer, adds new challenges and strategies to the gameplay.

Overall, Dead Island Riptide is a solid expansion to an already legendary game. It does an excellent job of building upon the foundation of the first game, while also bringing fresh and exciting elements to the table. Whether you are a fan of the original or new to the Dead Island series, this game is a must-play for any zombie game enthusiast.",1704833866,1704833866,True,15,1,0.584596455097198486,3,True,False,False

Cons
1. This game inherits all the bugs from the first game and becomes even more frustrating. 
2. They added some tower defense crap too.  How desperate when people are out of ideas.
3. Have you tried mines? There is the animation for laying mines, but not every time is a mine laid, what an embarrassing failure. 
4. Mobs teleporting, sometimes into the sky and fall to their death LOLOL
5. Mobs teleporting, into wonderlands, along with your fully upgraded modded throwing weapons. 
6. In the first game, there are only a few occasions where the runners instant respawn, but in this game, Techland decides to spam that mechanic. How desperate when people are out of ideas.
7. Somehow weapon mods are even harder to find and more useless.
8. Techland decides their game shall be a boss-fight game, and adds tons of bosses. ""Popular games have bosses, we should too"" right? Well other games' bosses are very very rewarding. 
9. (Edit) tried Logan today, and they nerfed his damage buff by 50%, instant-kill buff by 67%, and critical-rate buff by a whopping 90%.You have to understand, unlike other characters, Logan's skills are all over the place, weapon-throw is the only thing he's good at. Riptide buffed all other characters by adding this weapon familiarity system, and at the same time nerfed Logan's damage. That's basically double nerf. Techland? More like TechFailure.
10. (Edit again) I forced myself to use Logan in the first base defense battle. Holy moly, he went from Hero to Zero. He basically did no damage, died twice, and didn't make it in time to save his mates (my first playthrough was John, he made all the base defense like child's play). Logan is officially the weakest in Dead Island Riptide. He's good at basically nothing but throwing, and Techland took that away from him. This is further proof Techland is worse than amateur. I will definitely put this studio on my block list. 
 
Pros
1. Hey, Dead Island 2 changed hands, wheeww, thank god. 
2. Dyling Light 2 has turned into a clusterf^ck as well, well deserved.

This game is about the adventures of a group of survivors caught in a zombie outbreak on a tropical island. The game was released in 2016 and was highly appreciated for its graphics, gameplay and atmosphere.

The best part of the game is that there are plenty of weapons and equipment to kill zombies with. Knives, axes, hammers, pistols, rifles, bombs... You name it. You can also modify your weapons to make them more powerful and fun. For example, you can fry zombies crispy with an electric knife. 😁

Another great thing about the game is that you can play co-op with up to four people. It's easier and more fun to go zombie hunting with your friends. The story is not bad either, the characters' pasts and the relationships between them are interesting. The atmosphere of the game is also very successful, creating a contrast between the beauty of the island and the horror of the zombies.

Of course, there are some things I didn't like about the game. First of all, the optimization of the game is not very good. Fps drops in some places and stutters in others. If you want to play the game on high settings, you need a good system. Also, the artificial intelligence of the game is not very smart. Sometimes the zombies don't notice you, sometimes they crash into walls, and sometimes they hang in the air. These situations can be both funny and frustrating. 😅

In conclusion, Dead Island: Riptide Definitive Edition is a good option for those looking for a zombie-themed action game. The graphics, gameplay and atmosphere of the game will satisfy you. The game's optimization and artificial intelligence are a bit problematic, but if you play with friends, you can ignore these issues. The game is currently 85% off on Steam, don't miss it. I liked the game, I hope you will like it too. I wish you all good games. 👍

Summary:
""Dead Island: Riptide"" is an action role-playing survival horror video game developed by Techland and published by Deep Silver. It serves as a sequel to the original ""Dead Island"" game, continuing the story of a group of survivors battling hordes of zombies on a tropical island.

The game picks up immediately after the events of the first game, with the survivors finding themselves stranded on another island in the Banoi archipelago after narrowly escaping the zombie outbreak on the island of Banoi. The main characters - Logan, Purna, Sam B, and Xian Mei - along with a new character named John Morgan, must once again fight for survival against the relentless zombie horde and various other dangers.

Players explore the island, completing quests, scavenging for resources, and crafting weapons to fend off the infected and hostile human factions. The game features a combination of melee combat, gunplay, and RPG elements, allowing players to customize their characters' abilities and skills as they progress through the story.

Throughout the game, players encounter different types of zombies with unique abilities and strengths, as well as diverse environments ranging from dense jungles to flooded towns. The narrative unfolds as the survivors uncover the mysteries behind the outbreak while facing internal conflicts and external threats.

""Dead Island: Riptide"" emphasizes cooperative gameplay, allowing up to four players to join forces in the campaign, enabling teamwork to tackle challenges and missions together. The game received mixed reviews, with praise for its co-op experience, combat mechanics, and atmosphere, but criticism for technical issues and repetitive gameplay elements inherited from its predecessor.",1700820360,1700820360,True,4,0,0.482105880975723267,3,True,False,False

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992494675/recommended/383150/

Most things said there apply to this one, too.

So it is quite the same as Dead Island but with a few more bugged jumps and moves. Purnas special move is running like a moron towards zombies and flailing her weapon around uncontrollably, often not hitting anything with it because often she is simply glitching through them...

One difference is that you start in the Jungle in this one. It is a jungle that is a bit less horribly boring than the one in Dead Island, but nonetheless, it is boring.

One positive thing is that there are actually some new zombies.

The game is riddled with meaningless and useless generic side quests that can be completely ignored without any consequences. The main story quests are insanely monotone and repetitive. Even worse than the first Dead Island.
The side quests mean NOTHING. They do not change anything. You rescue somebody? Oh he will not even move. They just keep STANDING there. Why not alter the world at least a bit the more people you save? They are simply there to be saved and give you a bit of cash or items. Maybe after saving a certain amount add some allies or patrols to the game?

Your main occupation is to clear proper home bases for some meaningless and badly done characters you do not care about to move in for the duration of 1-2 main quests and then repeat that over and over again until the game is done. This was used so excessively and often, that I simply wanted them to die. They were just an anchor that dragged out the game a bit longer.

There is one character, I do not know his name because none of them is worth even memorizing, but he was the throwing weapon vendor. [spoiler] He was selling good grenades early on but he dies early. [/spoiler] So maybe stock on grenades in early game. 

They are anyway the best weapon until maybe 15 minutes before the end.

There are insane sound bugs, especially in co-op mode. And sometimes, some chest locators from quests are constantly beeping and heard in the entire map.

The story is just idiotic. 

When you look at the positive reviews, remember that less than 20% of players actually finished the game and just stopped at some point playing it. Same as it was with Dead Island.
Most of them simply tried it out a bit, killed some Zombies, and were happy about that.

If you simply want to play a game without a brain and shoot some zombies with the illusion of a story, meaningless NPC characters who are 100% generic and replaceable, a sh*t ton of bugs, and side quests that don't mean anything this game is meant for you.

After giving the Dead Island franchise another chance and playing this one I am quite certain I will only buy Dead Island 2 if it is 5 bucks or less and then so only to see the new mess Techland and Deep Silver have done. Maybe that is actually their selling strategy.",1696282710,1697677595,False,4,1,0.556477904319763184,0,True,False,False

Do I recommend it? yes and no. If you liked Dead Island then yes, this is more of that, with some more problems. If you didn't or you haven't played Dead Island then its an absolute no.
I had a ton of fun with the original, go play that first. This DLC is more Dead Island but it introduces a new Island and a few more problems or highlights the problems of the original even more. 
The base game was fun and dumb, not too hard and not too easy, this one ramps up the difficulty a fair bit to the point where it makes it not as fun, at least to me. There are plenty of Zombs that power through your attacks, so you will take damage regardless, and with the amount of Zombs that this game throws at you that will mean death. Also I feel like some of the Boss' are way over powered, I was above level of a Boss i fought and my attacks were still barely hurting him while it only took a few hits from him to kill me. Luckily this game only sets you back a tiny bit so you can mostly brute force your way through. 

Anyways TLDR if you liked the original then yes play this with a bit of more patience. If you didnt like or havent plyaed the OG then go do that first. Overall I still had fun but that's admittedly because i have a guilty pleasure for these types of games. so yes I recommend with some caveats",1697522694,1697522694,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While most new additions additions, such as a new character and fist-fighting weapons, are welcome and show improvement on the first outing, others, such as the boat segments only used for the first act, just didn't work and wound up being tedious. The story is a direct continuation of the first game which is nice, and it does give player characters more direct involvement, but it suffers from being a bit one-note, without much in the way of surprises or even new characters (I suppose it's a bit like a stage play to be honest). When the plot never moves beyond looking for ways to improve the home base, moving camp, or pursuing possible ways to escape the island, it's hard to remain invested. On the plus side, most side quests are either related to this goal or incidental good deeds you can do along the way, so they feel much more immediate and relevant (probably the most side quests I've done in one of games). On the plus side, it's playable in its entirety in co-op along with the first game, so that might be fun. Outside of that, compared to the first entry and especially Dying Light, you're completely fine skipping this one, there's really nothing you'll see that isn't done in DL in either a superior or more engaging/smooth way. Still nice to see the way the gameplay has progressed, a good reminder that home-runs often need a few iterations before the sweet spot.",1697391880,1697391880,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you get this game for free it's still not worth it. Please don't even bother. This game is honestly one of the worst I've ever played. The only thing that made it mildly entertaining was playing it co-op. Otherwise the 'Story' (because of a clear lack of imaginative writing) and side quests were completely pointless, felt like they had little, to no impact and gave pathetic rewards. At points it truly felt like the dev's had a good idea, then just gave up. 

(SIDE QUEST SPOILER WARNING) One side quest we thought actually had some imagination was the one where this guy asks you to find a superhero cape, superhero fish and superhero shoes. We thought this would lead somewhere funny (finally a side quest that we actually wanted to do). Yet, when we handed it in, he didn't change in appearance, he said ""follow me"" ran down the path (taking about 10 steps) we defended him against 2 zombies and he teleported back to where he originally was, said he wasn't interested in being a hero and just made the entire side quest completely pointless as he didn't even give us a reward. 

Don't even get me started on the bugs. There were times I was jumping over an obstacle to proceed, my character got stuck and I just died. There was items falling through the floor. Zombies stuck in a T pose. I could climb ladders then be teleported back to the bottom of the ladder. The sound bugs... oh god the constant sound bugs. You could hear a grenade going off as if it's right next to you, but it's my partner on the other side of the city. Or the constant beeping right in my ear as a side quest is telling me to head to the other side of the map to pick up a supply drop.

From the icy realms of HowlStrom, I, Kiba Snowpaw, have ventured into the tropical paradise turned nightmare of Banoi in Dead Island: Riptide Definitive Edition. With over 36 years of gaming experience under my furry belt, I bring you an in-depth, dramatic, and action-packed review of this game, with a touch of furry flair.

The Setting:
Imagine a world where the serene beauty of a tropical island meets the chilling horror of a zombie apocalypse. The juxtaposition of paradise and terror is a sight to behold. As I traversed the island, I couldn't help but draw parallels to my icy homeland of HowlStrom - both places of beauty, yet fraught with danger.

The Gameplay Experience:
The adrenaline rush of smashing, slicing, and surviving against hordes of the undead is unparalleled. The game's melee combat is visceral, making every swing, every hit, and every kill feel personal. The cooperative multiplayer mode adds another layer of depth, allowing for strategic team play and camaraderie.

Features and Graphics:
The remastered edition boasts improved graphics, game models, and a photorealistic lighting system. As an Ice Wolf with a keen eye for detail, I was particularly impressed by the game's atmospheric immersion. The shadows, the lights, and the overall ambiance transported me right into the heart of the action.

The Story and Characters:
The narrative picks up from where Dead Island left off, thrusting players into another thrilling adventure. The addition of John, the hand-to-hand combat expert, adds a fresh dynamic to the gameplay. Each character, from Sam B to Xian Mei, has a unique backstory and skill set, making for varied gameplay experiences.

Critique and Furry Insights:
While the game offers a plethora of features and improvements, it's not without its flaws. Some bugs and glitches from the original remain, which can be a tad frustrating. However, as a seasoned gamer, I've learned to look beyond minor imperfections and appreciate the broader experience.

From a furry perspective, the game's themes of survival, camaraderie, and bravery resonate deeply. Just as we furries stick together in the face of adversity, so do the characters in Dead Island: Riptide. Their determination to survive against all odds mirrors the furry community's resilience and spirit.

Conclusion:
Dead Island: Riptide Definitive Edition is more than just a game; it's an experience. It's a tale of survival, friendship, and bravery set against the backdrop of a paradise turned hell. For those who've played the original, this remastered edition offers a fresh perspective. For newcomers, it's a thrilling introduction to the world of Dead Island.

In the words of a wise Ice Wolf from HowlStrom, ""In the face of danger, we find our true strength."" Whether you're battling zombies on Banoi or facing challenges in the real world, remember to stand tall, stay strong, and always keep your furry spirit alive.

Howl on, fellow gamers!

This game continues from where Dead Island 1 left the story. It's very similar to Dead Island 1, which is practically Dying Light without Parkour. The story was ok but the gameplay was as awesome as before.

The main issue with this game is it's frustrating at times especially due to its bug and navigation. You will enjoy all its zombie killing with modified brutal skull reaping weapons but during traversal in between main and side missions, the navigation route will suddenly disappear almost all the time! The minimap has no real map in it so you will get mad opening the main map again and again!

Also, I found a bug in few initial missions if you explore more and reach the point that you are supposed to reach in the later checkpoint, the game will skip the previous checkpoint which logically will not make much sense. I also encountered 2-3 cases where direction to objectives (side missions) were either too dumb or totally wrong for which I had to rely on Google lol.

Apart from these, the game is awesome if you want more of Dead Island or Dying Light but you will miss parkour so much. Remember you can import your character and unlocked skills levels from the previous Dead Island which I realised after finishing the game... -_-",1677950556,1690033312,True,23,0,0.709459125995635986,9,True,False,False

I know you can just look at the map, but it was just a lot more convenient having it.

The new areas and voice acting are pretty cool, so I’ll give them some credit for that, the story is also slightly more interesting and better presented since the protagonists speak a lot more. The soundtrack surprisingly caught my attention too, it has some really good tracks.

I do have a soft spot for this series and it was pretty fun getting all of the achievements, it’s just that it could’ve been a lot better with a few tweaks. You’ll most likely enjoy it if you liked the first game and felt like playing more of it.

'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ahh-oh

Everything that dead island has + new insta kill by being above  walker , infected to assassinate them.
Less functional :
- Throw has 2 issues - Throw aim assist either doesnt exist or is not working as intented since it :
- Throws if your target has another zombie next to it , it can throw it self to the other one or it misses.
- Thanks to sharp weapons is highly probable that aim assist doesnt work correctly. Since it stucks onto the enemy.
- Another one not throwing exacly but object in area can completly block you from picking it up.
- Another problem is same as object but a little diffrent, i threw a sharp weapon at a drowner and it died fell thought the stairs , took it with him.
- Stalwart Defense 3 crashes and bug :
1. There are 2 thugs that need to stay alive untill other zombies are dead, otherwise it crashes. Happened 2x
2. i put up the fence right as the thug touch the brick wall and it gave me error RARE to happen.
3. If you do not have a single drowner corpse around the base it wont spawn the wave so you have to load checkpoint ,  also you cannot kick the corpse or hit it.
(The dead talk.)

Positive : 
Probably higher hp pools , Dead zones with high hp bosses , forced to modify , upgrade weapons.
Infinite quest high xp.
Non Riptide :
I wish Epidemic was revived with Pier to pier connection.
With dlc as the way of earning money.
If was to exprience Epidemic again maybe it would change my mind. (probably)

It's neither as disastrously buggy nor (alas) quite as ambitious, epic, and visually attractive. However, it's playable and doesn't  wreak constant frustration as it forgets your quest progress and sets you back (sometimes) hours of playtime, as the original did for me. 

The maps are less expansive and breathtaking, but there are cool little surprises and hidden areas to be found. Walkers and Infected are less overpowered and won't mob you to death at every opportunity as they did previously. If you're okay w/ wearing out your ""kick"" key, and don't mind running from larger groups/luring enemies away to whittle them down, you can progress w/ reasonable ease. Combat is tense and fun, but as long as you're not leaping into ludicrous situations, you'll die much less  frequently than in the first game. Vehicles are far more valuable this time out - they rack up the kills nicely and I've yet to have one get damaged and break down on me. Quest waypoints on the minimap are as useless as ever but I don't mind wandering around, exploring, and just coming upon my objectives. 

I recall the character animations (both human NPCs and zombies) being more detailed and cool last time - there's some highly busted looking human survivors wandering around this game. No idea what that's about.

More of the same. The problem of this game is not only the expectations most people have but also some smaller bugs, which to be fair, the first game wasn't really free of. Instead of advertising it as a big DLC or expansion, it was made to be the next game but absolutely feels like the first.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
Some smaller combat mechanics changed that apparently the first dead island even adapted in its definitive edition. But no idea what exactly is definitive about this one, it didn’t had any DLC really. Otherwise the only new thing is that you now can level up to 70 with like 2-4 new skills, additionally passive levelling and new passive abilities from using a certain weapon type. There is a new dash attack you can skill on, which works almost like the rush from Sam, except worse. 

There is a new vehicle, the boat which works pretty neat. The problem is that it has set spawn locations and if you go in a dungeon you will lose it and have to run to the next spawn location of a boat. There are now a couple of copy paste dungeons, with some strong bosses although they are not specifically different except more tanky.

There is now a better playstyle for ranged combat to the point that it is almost the optimal way as they now spawn way much more ammo for every type, also giving new players who want to level ranged combat flare guns and spear guns early on.

The same pros and cons from the first game are present here aswell, therefore I wont go over them again. The only negative might be that the game is rather short and features less maps. Around 2 major ones and a few very small ones. The big maps have atrocious quick travel systems, making you go back and forth the map a lot due to quests often giving you fetch tasks on the other side of the map.

[u]Story[/u]
You might want to get this to see the relatively weak story continuing. It starts directly after the first game, the boat you go on crashes and you land on another island trying to escape it due to the virus having spread on surrounding islands too. The overall story is weak, with a small twist at the end that I didn’t expect but is rather not that important. It ends in a mechanically weak boss fight where you have to use a random mutagen despite clearly winning the fight. The enemy used a mutagen to get stronger, but physically changed absolutely in no way making it a joke of a fight.

[u]Sound[/u]
Nothing new. Except they constantly play sam b songs over the radio and added a new one.

[u]Graphics[/u]
Nothing changed. Basically exactly the same visuals, except a few new zombie variations and survivor skins.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
Only really useful for completionists. Its more of the same and absolutely fun to continue your characters from the previous game with your friends. But mechanically and gameplay wise so close to the main game. It should have been just advertised as an expansion and even then there is the amount of bugs and subpar story. It doesn't do particularly anything wrong but i feel like i already played through the same game for the most part.

Weak story but fun gameplay. Do every side quest you find and don't rush as the ending isn't worth it. Best played with friends. Worth it if on sale. (75% off or more.) Watch out for zombies with knives!

Also be sure to set your Vsync settings in your control panel to use the application setting to avoid stutter.

This one however changed my perspective on fast travel permanently. Yes, games should absolutely give you the option to fast travel from any point. The open world is so fucking awful that getting around on foot/boat is a complete nightmare. To add insult to injury, they didn't bother fixing the bugs from their previous title. In fact, they just added more. They also decided that the number of annoying enemies wasn't enough so they throw new nuisances at you. And for whatever reason, they decided that enemies should be insanely tankier now. To make this worse, they introduce a brand new type of mission. At various points throughout the story you're forced to survive a mindless horde spam. It's not fun and goes on for far too long. It goes to show that if the devs can't torture you with moronic fetch quests, they instead throw literal feces at you, hoping that you mistake it for a challenge.

First of all, it's important that you have played Dead Island, because the story of Dead Island Riptide Happened exactly after ending of the first game. Except completing the story, Riptide just copy everything from the first game, make it a little better and just give us a new area, but one thing is not solved and that is that the game has a lot of bugs, which is really sucks. If you enjoyed the first game, you probably will have some fun on doing the main quests of Dead Island Riptide.

I recently had the urge to play it again and bought the Dead Island Definitive Edition, reliving my memories as well and loving the improvements made to the game!

After spending 80 or so hours in that game and still loving it, i decided to buy Riptide DE during a sale, understanding it was more of the same but with new maps and some new weapons. Boy, was I wrong.

The combat is pretty much the same, with some minor additions like a instant-kill / high damage QTE when you're on higher ground you can perform on a walker / infected. It sounds great, except its buggy as heck and locks you into the attack animation, after which I have found myself stuck for a few seconds as the animation often bugs out after the attack and you're left helplessly getting wailed on by enemies.

There are some improvements like the addition of throwing weapons now, which can stack up to 30 in a slot so you no longer have to throw your previous normal weapons at the enemy, however, the throwing weapons have pretty low damage, which wouldn't have been a problem for the original DI, but in DI:Riptide, almost every enemy has had a major buff in health, so much that special infected are basically bullet sponges for everything non-fury related.

Your basic special infected like Thugs and Floaters seem to have more than twice the health they had in the original game, even with my imported Logan throwing fully upgraded gold weapons at them, with my weapon proficiency already level 10. Walkers and infected also seem to do more damage, and Riptide absolutely spams the heck out of these. I'm not kidding when I say spam; just leaving the starting village you'll get rushed by about 5 walkers and 3 infected. Its so much that it totally desensitizes me to the zombies, and i no longer feel any sense of terror when I hear an infected scream, and I feel more of a sense of annoyance. 

If the developers made these changes to encourage players to run past enemies instead of fighting, they totally succeeded IMO. Where I used to enjoy killing zombies and still feel a sense of fear and dread when fighting infected in DI:DE, in DI: Riptide DE I just avoid combat where possible, which is hilarious in a game all about killing zombies. Realistic or not, I absolutely hated fighting in DI: Riptide.

In terms of exploration, other than the problem with the spamming of zombies everywhere, many areas of the starting map is filled with water. While traversing water isn't that bad, even on foot, the problem is when you get attacked by zombies. When in water, the player character is significantly slowed down, and in waist high water, you lose the ability to sprint. Unfortunately, the same isn't true for zombies. Even the basic walker is faster than the PC in water, and infected are still able to sprint like Olympic runners while in water.

The spamming of zombies and annoying travel thus contributes to the next problem in the game: The boring sidequests which are basically just fetchquests / go to a location and kill this thing. While DI:DE has the same type of quests, I enjoyed traveling through the different locations in Banoi, and enjoyed the combat, so it wasn't a problem for me. In Riptide however, getting a sidequest that points to a location about 300m away made me groan in pain, knowing the amount of crap I had to wade through just to reach it.
 
Perhaps these are the rantings of a poorly skilled Dead Island player, but I personally think DI: Riptide DE is just a complete chore to play, and if you are a new player looking for some zombie killing action, get DI:DE or DI:2.",1684197847,1684197847,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i am glad i waited for it to be for that. I think the first one was way better. this felt like a cash grab. they used all their library of fx, graphics n sounds. Some minor modifications here n there. But the glitches are still there. adding boats to the game was kinda stupid. They are only used in the first map and not seen again. The story concludes with them finding a boat to get out of the island, yet the first boat u get can sail in the ocean? like WHAT!? lol story is so meh! did liked the new weapons. I pushed through the game just to see the story and honestly there is no story. If u were disappointed on the first story ending? this one pulls a walking dead reboot bs ending. i was hoping they would do more but no. i guess ill wait for Dead island 2 to go into discount before i buy. There's stuff in this story that makes this game seemed to be in the same universe as of their other games in the Dying Light. on last map your character suffers from similar rage virus animations. Kinda bums me out cuz seeing this, means they just recycled the story and made a new game. Other than the glitches n meh story? i had my fun. i dont think ill do a replay though.

That being said, when you start a new game and carry over progression from the 1st Dead Island, What is kept is your player level and skills. Your inventory items, weapons, money and blueprints are gone. The game still sends zombies that are around your level after you. For characters like Sam B who can make use of blunt weapons, even low quality ones, this isn't too bad. He can still delivery heavy hits and be very effective even with weaker weapons. But for characters like Purna, who specialize is guns, this characters suffers a lot. Since her skills are mostly focused on guns and not melee, she really struggles during the early game. The only gun you get for a good portion of the beginning is a flare gun, which is a fun and effective weapon, but it doesn't stay that way and is sometimes useless when parts of the map are flooded waist high. Thankfully, the weapon upgrade system that levels up specific weapons based on what types you use makes it less difficult, but getting Purna from basically 0 up to the standard you need is not easy.

There's also new guns to play with. The shotgun selection is so much better, in the first game they were very weak, but here they've been buffed and deal great damage. There's some new melees and the game adds a lot more explosive tools to play with. Another great change with this is that traders now have a specific set of gear. One trader will sell throwing weapons, but another will sell heavy weapons. It's a great change and makes finding new weapons for your characters so much easier. 

Now, this game is fun, but the starting area is a real poor start. First off, starting with all your inventory taken away with no notice that it will happen when you carry over progression is not a good beginning. Second, doing it again at the start right when you get some cool weapons is really scummy. Third, the drowner zombies. These guys are such a pain to deal with. This game adds a travel by boat since there's flooding. And in the water, the drowner zombies sprint towards you. Not when you get close to them, if they are within 20 feet of you and you are just in the boat, they sprint towards you. They latch onto your boat and if they climb on, won't stop attacking you. When you stop controlling the boat, your character gets off the boat, which wastes even more of your time. If you decide to travel by foot in the water, they don't care unless you get right on top of them. You can get them off by speeding up with the boat, but the game doesn't tell you boats have a speed up ability, and no other vehicle has this, so you probably won't know about it first time playing. On top of that, even if you escape them latching onto your boat, since they still sprint, they will catch up to where you stop, so you still have to deal with them. Plus, later on the drowner's rules change. When you reach a new area, there's still flooding and you only travel by foot. This time, they will wake up even if you are farther away in the water. But sometimes they still don't wake up unless you are on top of them. So unless you want to check every body that hasn't woken up, you are going to have to hope they don't so you can move forward.

Now, the first area does have a great new mode that happens at scripted points. A defense mode with a horde of zombies coming to attack your position. You don't fight alone, the traders and other story characters fight alongside you. If you play single player, the other playable characters are with you fighting. You can also level up their weapons, or for traders, shops. These give you new blueprints and a lot of xp, and it also makes them more effective fighters. 

The second area of the game is where things get much better. The flooded areas are in much smaller amounts and fighting zombies is more fun. By this point, the newer guns and better ones from the previous game are given by this point. And, the ammo for them is in much more abundant supply instead of being in the safe house or in small gang hideouts. So, you are able to use your guns much more freely and without as much restraint. There is also where Purna is much more fun thanks to her gun skills and the new weapon level-ups. 

So overall, while the first area can be a pain, it does add a lot of new stuff that's fun to play with. And the second area is where the game picks up and is a ton of fun. If you can get through the first location of the game, you'll definitely have a better time in the second since this where ammo is in higher supply and great new guns are introduced. 

I rate this game (as a whole) a 7/10",1683014646,1683014667,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It suffers the same fate as dead island 1 remaster a terrible pc port. they were even so lazy on the steam store page main summary game description of the first game to riptide. Riptide of in its self is just a glorified expansion pack of dead island 1 basically a expand alone game. sure there is new special zombie types and a somewhat new island and one new playable character but the combat which was just or  okay or decent in the original is exactly the same and not improved what so ever. quest structure is also mostly the same. The reason I wouldn't recommend it is for the reason I wouldn't recommend dead island 1 definitive edition because the PC port sucks and as remaster it fails or ever level as it isn't 60 frames a second and the graphics don't look much different and they might actually be worse because of that terrible blur effect with the lighting. don't bother unless you are willing to find ways to patch the game yourself by using mods or tweaking setting that aren't available in the game's menu. dead island riptide and 1 as it stands are just okay to decent  games probably a serviceable 7 out of 10 or even a high 6 out of 10. the only difference between these games and other zombie games is just really the setting.",1682408705,1682408828,False,1,0,0.494960814714431763,0,True,False,False

Story is okaish and keeps you entertained for some time. There are a bunch of sidequests. Riptide got a few more so called Dead Zones you can farm if you wanted as leaving and reentering them respawns everything inside. There are a few named Enemies in certain Dead Zones which were part of a challenge/achievment. This felt repetitive and the [spoiler]final levels of the campaign are recycled parts of the hospital/prison from dead island[/spoiler]. I would recommend getting atleast 1 or 2 mods from nexusmods to fix the narrow FOV and maybe the essential fixes for chromatic abberation, motion blur, depth of field etc.

I used the essential fixes and increased the FOV to 85 (don't go higher as things break) myself.

Infected are everywhere and some points continuously spawn them as long as you are nearby making it incredibly easy to be overrun and chain hit to death. The number of zombies that throw weapons at you are substantially higher as well and even with max health talents it's instant death. Traversing the jungle via boat is also pretty rough because drowners are so frequent, which once one gets lucky enough to rip you off the boat it's a slog to kill them in water deep enough to restrict your movement. It feels like overall damage was increased as well but I can't confirm that 100% other than by saying I used far more medkits more often.

Having jumped into this after finishing Dead Island just the other day it's easy to see the core concept is still present, but this feels somehow like an entirely different experience. Faster paced and a bit more overwhelming in a sense, which is maybe due to a greater density of zombies in certain areas. I think a better fast travel system or more points could have mitigated that feeling. Still a good game for what it is.",1681251535,1681251535,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

So far this Game feels like a DLC to the first Dead Island Installment. Which i have not played, so the intro/flashback Sequence, though necessesary, feels forced and bored me more than making me excited to play. A big part of the Game Experience so far is rather story/Cutscene-Heavy, which can be great, as long as certain Criteria are met. For Example I got no sense of impact from what was happening around me and all the Characters felt very shallow. The Storyline is the Videogame equivalent of vanilla Ice cream and every Sense of Choice/Freedom feels superficial. The Controls are clearly made for Console Gaming, on Keyboard and Mouse it all feels a bit wonky.
All in all, it seems to me like a Left4Dead Clone with a few loose RPG Elements slapped on top.",1677831173,1677831173,False,1,1,0.451366961002349854,0,True,False,False

The second entry in the [i] Dead Island [/i] game series. Not a prequel, and not quite a sequel. So is this game worth the buy? Let's get into it. 

[h1] [b] The Good [/b] [/h1]

[*] [b] The Setting [/b]
- The Dead Island game's call to fame is its beautiful setting. ""Its zombies.... But on a tropical island"" was probably the birthing idea for this game series. All jokes aside, Riptide stays true to its predecessor and lets you explore through the scenic island ""paradise"", the flooded jungles, and eventually the urban hellscape that is the city of Hederson. When optimized correctly, these can all be intriguing and visually appealing scenes.

[*] [b] The Nostalgia [/b]
- If you're playing [i] Dead Island: Riptide [/i], there a chance that you played [i] Dead Island [/i] as well. Riptide knows this and does a decent job of bringing a little joy in from the past with continued references, Easter eggs, and continuations from the previous game. Its always nice to get a little blast from the past. 

[*] [b] The Playable Characters [/b]
- Some may say that playing as the same characters through multiple games is unoriginal and lame. I disagree, for me it helps continue their story. In Riptide, you get have five options this time around. Your choices are:

Sam B - Rapper who beats things to death
Logan - Professional Football player who throws things at other things until they die
Purna - Security who shoots things to death 
Xian Mei - Receptionist and ex-military who stabs things to death
John - Australian soldier who punches and kicks things to death

- Essentially, you can carry over your save from the first Dead Island as whatever character, or choose to play as John, the new character to the story. Never a bad thing to spice it up a little

[h1] [b] The Bad  [/b] [/h1]

[*] [b] The Story [/b]
- Now... the first Dead Island didn't exactly have the [b] best [/b] story around, but it at least was original for the series (because it was the first game.... duh). Riptide, though, decided to be brave! To be bold! Brazen even! They do this by..... Having basically the same story as the first game? ""No, that can't be right."" *checks notes*. ""They get stranded on an island deserted with zombies, check"". ""Then, they have to head further into the Jungle, check"". ""After that, they have to head through the sewers or tunnels... to get to the large city nearby... Oh"". ITS LITERALLY THE SAME STORY. LIKE THE FIRST GAME ENDS, AND THEN YOU GET SENT THROUGH THE SAME EXACT THING. It's crazy man... and kind of lame.

[*] [b] The Enemies [/b] 
- Its okay to have use the same enemies from the previous games, even in zombie games. Look at Left 4 Dead. But they at least polished how they act, and added multiple new zombies. From what I could see, there was literally only one new zombie in this game. Every other enemy was just copy pasted from the first game. Speaking of copy pasting ....

[*] [b] The Graphics and Detail [/b]
- There are like... no improvements in this game. It looks entirely the same. All models (zombies, characters, weapons, etc.) are the same as the first game. This isn't a big issue to me personally, but its part of a larger problem I will address later. 

[*] [b] The weapons and Fighting [/b]
- Multiple issues here. First, there has been practically no improvement from the first game. The melee attacks are still glitchy and clanky like in the first game. Second, all the weapon upgrades and improvements are basically the same. Yeah, there's fire, shock, bleed, and poison options, but there will be like, eight of them, and they all do, and look the same. It honestly feels kind of lazy. Third, the combat does not always register. You see a katana slice through a walker, but it doesn't hit or damage them. Inconvenient for a small fight, deadly for a major one. Throwing weapons clip through the map, making you lose rare and upgraded gear because it shot through a cliff.

[*] [b] The Clipping and NavMeshing [/b]
- You get stuck on everything in this game. You'll be running down a street being chased by a butcher and 10 infected, and your foot will clip onto the edge of a small trash can, and now you've completely stopped moving and are now dead. You will clip through ledges making you fall to your death. I've even fell through the map once while walking through the jungle. 

[h1] [b] The Ugly [/b] [/h1]

[*] [b] The Preformance [/b]
- Before getting started, no it is not my internet. No it is not my brand new gaming pc. No it is not a problem on my end. Look in any forum or comment string for this game and you see it to. This game... preforms [b] HORRIBLY [/b]. The title screen is sluggish, the actual game is horribly laggy and feels like it can barely run. Its bad enough that you could even get a headache over it. I don't understand what they did wrong, as the original [i] Dead Island [/i] from years earlier, runs perfectly. Smooth as butter. This game is clanky and rough.

[*] [b] The Lack of Originality [/b]
- This game is not a sequel. It is barely different from the first game, which I believe to be vastly superior. The combat is no different. The story is no different. The setting is barely different, you just moved over a couple islands. The game just does not in any way feel like a separate entity. It honestly fails to uphold the same standards set by the first [i] Dead Island [/i]

[h1] [b] Overall  [/b] [/h1]

Dead Island: Riptide is a DLC that pretends to be a real game. It is completely unoriginal and fails to differ from its predecessor in any way, even the PLOT OF THE STORY. It fails to bring anything new or interesting to the table and doesn't excel in any form. It performs worse, looks no better, and plays significantly worse that the first game. The fact that they charged $60 dollars for this should be a crime. They should of just released this as an add-on DLC for Dead Island , charged you $30 and called it a day.  At least if they did that, me and thousands of others wouldn't feel ripped off

That turns the infectious into L4D esque zombies

While perfecting your combat techniques against an onslaught of zombies
And add perks to your character

And head stomps
And lighting them on fire

To just have fun

Let's pick at the story of it....okay so you escape from the main island where you began and end up on a ship, a ship that somehow gets overrun with zombies....highly unlikely and it crashes......there you are on yet another island.  Let's not forget that on the ship you had some decent items including some good guns, but when you awaken on the island post crash your weapons mysteriously disappear as you're greeted by some random female and instantly nailed with a fetch quest for a group of people you don't know if you can trust.  

Is there any build up to the stories of the people on the island? Nope.  Just everything thrown at you all at once and don't try to use the map legend as it really doesn't have one.

The engine uses the same engine as the first game, which means same bugs and glitches, as well as same play-style for the most part, which isn't a bad thing since the combat can be quite enjoyable more often than not. The skill-tree has some improvements from the first game too [spoiler](Getting up quicker after being knocked down)[/spoiler].

Overall a good game to play-through if you enjoyed the first game and you're looking for some extra story and a new map (which often is more annoying to traverse through really). 

A great refresher game to play whilst waiting for DI2 and hoping it will be as great a game as it's predecessors.

The story is laughable, Im pretty sure i prefer the first games story but seeing as I've played that one ages ago I cannot quite recall, wouldnt be surprised if they copied that aspect of it too and just literally made Dead Island 1.15.
Even if we disregard the entire copy aspect of it the story is still laughably terrible, im pretty sure if you asked a classroom of prepubescent teens to each write their own zombie ridden world one of them would write a better one than this.

This game is one of the most wanted play in my Highschool era. But at the time i dont have miney to buy any steam games. But now i have so i bought it. Just realised DI Riptide is continuity of Dead Island. So damn i must buy another one. But judging with my current standard of games. This is my review:

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ Graphics is good for its time.
+ Story is linear but understandable
+ World is rich enough than original Dead Island
+ Lots of customization, some is better than original DI
+ Really fun with friends

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Story too short. Especially for its price, it feels like small DLC/expansion pack than new game.
- Its really boring to Play alone. Must play with friends..
- Playing alone also harder. Because every characters has unique traits, its kinda hard to maximize all stats when you needed.
- Idk the VA and Music kinda terrible for me. Music i replace it with my Spotify. VA makes certain scene forgetable.
- After I played the 1st game, this game actually much more smaller in city size. Making me felt MORE about this game should be a DLC than sequels/newer game.
[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
The conclusion is this game is a fun multiplayer zombie game, well made with few glitches, and had few upgrades than original DI game. But as a new game, this should be a DLC...",1569961134,1672691891,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

How this game has so many positive reviews is a mystery to rival the vanishing of the Roanoke colony. I only paid $4.00 for this game and I still feel like I got ripped off. Had I paid full price and Steam refused to give me a refund my next call would be to my lawyer to pursue civil litigation (yes I would be that petty). I played this game for 7+ hours before I finally could not take it anymore. Here is the gist of it: half of all melee attacks just clip right through enemies to the point that anything but weapons with a large attack radius (like pickaxes and shovels) are completely useless, the jump attack puts you into a frozen animation about 50% of the time (leaving you open to attack), enemies (especially thugs) will somehow hit you despite being far out of grabbing range, and ""infected"" cannot be killed with a vehicle as they just clip right over the top of your car. But worst of all is the motorboat. About half of the vehicle travel in the game is done using a new motorboat that is used to traverse the rivers and flooded areas (which make up a significant portion of the map). The water is absolutely crawling with zombies, far too many to avoid. Every zombie will immediately clip under the boat which will cause it to become stuck which basically means death as you cannot run through water, but the zombies can (WTF????). Motorboat travel is virtually impossible in this game, and if not impossible then it is so ungodly frustrating that the developers should be paying the players to put up with it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF IT IS ON SALE! IT IS NOT WORTH PLAYING EVEN IF THE GAME IS OFFERED FOR FREE! Play the first Dead Island, and if you already have then move onto a different game series.

What followed was a week of pain and suffering that became unbearable after just a few hours and I had to put it down for a couple days before limping over the finish line.

I went in wanting to fully experience game, getting all the collectibles, all quests, yadda yadda yadda. However after a multitude of crashes, something that only happened once on Dead Island, even for as janky as it is, should've been the biggest warning. Regardless, I pressed on, and what I found was quest after quest after quest of getting someone's crap from the other side of the damn map and bringing it back to them and it was just so unbelievably tedious that by the time I got to the second area I gave up on doing any of the side quests or even getting the collectibles and just rushed through the story, but even that was a slog.

In the story you are beset by incompetent survivors who find it their best idea to take the absolute piss out of the immune people because....... reasons? They say it's because they're really aggressive and highly agitated, but hell, when you keep being a pissant and keep giving them shit for.... being aggressive towards zombies? it get's really annoying. By the end I didn't give a single damn about any of these survivors, whether they lived or died horribly, just the purest distillation of apathy. 

And finally we come to the bugs. Oh dear God, the bugs. I don't know how many times I had to restart that stupid, idiotic, retarded cinema holdout because Infected kept spawning into the walls or places where I couldn't kill them. There's also the laser zombies that every knows about, those are real fun. Quest dialogue just... not happening. Sound cutting out. Quests being uncompletable for unknown reasons. The map marker having a mind of it's own, you get the idea. The game is busted and is probably held together by hope and a very thin lining of glue.

And for the last section, the bosses. The really bad, not-fun-at-all bosses. I've never really wanted to fight jacked-up versions of enemies and this game just took that idea and ran with it, and boy, are they not fun. Playing as Sam B, I found the only real reliable way to kill the bosses was have full Fury and hope to Christ you could out heal their damage or stun lock them. If they had multiple Infected spawn in the fight, guess what, you're boned. You will get swarmed and die so fast it isn't funny. I don't ever remember dying once in Dead Island while having Fury active, but in Riptide it was constant; everything just chunks your healthbar even if you build into tankiness, you don't feel any stronger. However, there is one light in this tunnel and that is the Harlow fight. Harlow is a complete joke as Sam B. You activate Fury, bum rush her, and stun lock her into oblivion, then you use the McGuffin and get infinite Fury and  you just stun lock into a corner until the game tells you to stop. The fight is still bad, don't get me wrong; after punching her for a solid 30 seconds the sound just cut out except for her grunts of pain, even the chainsaw was gone. But yeah, you just punch Harlow for about 3 minutes straight then you walk a somehow confusing route to the boat (Seriously Deep Silver, why make the route overly complicated and not just a straight to the dock?), watch the one guy you've wanted to kill the whole game die, sail off, and get a very pedestrian ending that unfortunately looks like it's gonna be canon considering Dead Island 2.

And with all that, I uninstalled and will never be finishing this game, plain and simple. It's just bad.",1672127801,1672127801,False,1,1,0.481697738170623779,0,True,False,False

Nope, it's the game itself. I am unsure how you ruin something as basic as copy and pasting movement from one game to the other but well done on failing with that. Combat feels unsatisfying compared to the first game in the series and due to glitches you die at random. You park 2 boats too close and try to get out? that's illegal and you die. You are minding your own business and a zombie throws a plank of wood at your head across the map like 150m, well guess what? You're insta dead.

This game is one of the must play games if you are a co-op guy. It has a good story, okay figting mechanics and too much laugh (if you are playing with a friend!).
Pros:
+Open world
+Different equipments and modifications
+An extra character that we did not see in the first game.
Cons:
-This continuation game does not add much to the original story, it feels like the producers wanted to earn the extra money by creating this one and use the fame of the earlier game.
-Some missions are not explanatory enough that you do not know when it will be active and where to do it.
-NPCs could get involved more as it is always fun to see them fight.

[h1]My Main Negative[/h1]

Regularly enough for it to be an annoyance, when I died I was spawned back into the game directly next to a zombie. Considering they're rarely alone and I had used my character from the first game, the zombies were extremely high level from the word ""go"" meaning, I often found myself essentially being spawned into an instant death situation.

[h1]My Main Positive[/h1]

The game as an overall is mindless fun with many laugh out loud moments making it extremely easy to relax with.

I hope you’ve packed enough sunscreen, baseball bats, machetes and Molotov cocktails in the first game, because you will need plenty of them again!

Riptide picks up immediately where the previous game ended. You can even import your character and your progress from the previous game, but this is something you need to think through first, as weapons and blueprints are NOT carried over, meaning you will be immediately pitched against high level enemies, while you try to defend yourself with a low level broomstick, for example. The game itself is no different from its predecessor. If you expect better graphics, a lot of improved gameplay or less bugs and glitches, you will be disappointed. On the other hand, if you really enjoyed [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067384854/recommended/383150/]Dead Island[/url], you will have no problem jumping right in and enjoy this one as well.

Despite being pretty much the same, the sequel does have a few new things to offer. The first thing it does is introduce a fifth and new playable character to you, the sympathetic John Morgan. Once again, all characters have their own three unique skill trees that you can use to improve your character’s fighting abilities and chances of survival. Another cool thing is Hub Defense, in which you and some other survivors have to defend your sanctuary against a horde of undead. Next to cars you now also have boats. Those are more of a necessity than a commodity, since going for a casual swim isn’t really recommend anymore post-zombie apocalypse. Gun enthusiasts will also be happy to know that guns are more prevalent in this game than in the previous, which relied much more on melee combat. There are more new features, but I’ll let you figure that out yourself.

The soundtrack is provided again by Paweł Błaszczak, who does another great job in creating a grim and despairing atmosphere but - when it’s time for a breather - also knows how to calm you down.

Like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067384854/recommended/383150/]Dead Island[/url], despite being the Definitive Edition and including all the DLC, it also has its flaws. If you are a forgiving player like me and have a vivid imagination, then you will have a blast. As long as you can complete it and it isn’t too game-breaking, it personally doesn’t bother me that much. Life isn’t perfect and neither are video games. As far as I’m concerned, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067384854/recommended/383150/]Dead Island[/url] and Dead Island: Riptide are still two of the best zombie games ever made.

That irritation quickly faded as I got used to the controls and started just melting into the story.   By the time I was running all of the church missions, I was hooked.  Going back and forth between the various areas also made the world feel alive... the game was phenomenal.

This one? Not so much.

When you finish in an area, you're done... you just go from one to the next.  You CAN go back, but there's no need to.  The mission variety was also pretty minimal... mostly fetch quests buffering the main story.  As for the emotional heart-strings of the original...?  There is ONE quest where you are tasked with helping a dude find his wife, and there are maybe two moments of that quest where it comes kind of close to the feels of the original Dead Island...but that's it.

I'm not recommending it, but the only people who might want to play Riptide are people who JUST played DI the first time, and want to see the story through till the end.

       More Dead Island. If you want more Dead Island here it is. This game doesn't add much more in terms of game play. I prefer the atmosphere and location of the first game. In the second half of the game. When you get to Oldtown you can really see the DNA of Techland's next game ""Dying Light"". The city looks a lot like Harran and the way it is verticle, all the survivors living on rooftops, you can really see where they got the parkour/free running idea for Dying light.

I love the casebook thing that details the zombies and the inclusion of your chosen player character having way more to say and the voice acting being better overall. Hearing Sam B always made me happy. That's about the only change i like though unfortunately. The new combat moves are extremely janky (ofcourse it is its dead island) and often made me feel disappointed when i used them and would prefer if they were just not even here as they don't really add much to the game as they are. The plot is about as disappointing as the first game with missions being mostly fetch quest like, the difference being that riptides world is a slog to explore. The boat controls terribly and will be stopped if a single zombie gets in front of it which totally kills the flow. The cars should have just been left out the game as every road is blocked with some foliage or water making them useless to exist in this map. The new zombie types are not very creative and feel like remodels of existing zombies, and they barely ever show up anywhere anyway. This game is even less polished than dead island and some areas are just missing details so obvious that it baffles me how nobody bothered to correct it. The combat isn't anymore difficult but zombies feel more spongy than before and spawn in even bigger hoards, which mostly just leads to you being trapped in a corner fending off against a ton of tanky enemies while you sit there helpless.

Unsurprising, as Dead Island is one of my 10/10 all favorite games (and have literally thousands).

Took out 1 point, as I play solo, and it's designed for coop. 
Of course this will not apply for coop gamers.
It's that even if you can play it SP, it's rather too hard *for me* at times.

I clicked my mouse at various things and objects.  I progressed, imputed, and even upgraded.  I most certainly played a video game.  And that’s all there is.

I could dig into Dead Island: Riptide.  I could go over the slow pacing both in story and movement, the long and sluggish animations, the zombies spawning right in front of me, instant respawning with little to no penalties, the terrible writing and voice acting, the confusing themes, and so on and so forth.  I could do all of that.

But why bother?  It doesn’t take much for me to go on a tirade on even the most basic of games.  How they are hollow cash grabs or lacking in artistic integrity or missing the importance of a cohesive theme and good narrative.  I’ve done it for worse games, I’ve given games like Homefront and Wildlands a fair shake, why should Dead Island be any different?

Thing is those games all invoked some sort of emotion in me.  Almost all negative emotions, but emotions nonetheless.  Anger, sadness, and hopelessness from merely playing them.  Dead Island doesn’t do any of this, it just sort of exists.  It is just competent enough, that’s really a good way to describe the whole game, it’s just competent enough.

The writing is below average but it’s passable.  The characters are boring and stale but not incompetant or irrational.  The gameplay is clunky and slow but it works well enough.  Its themes are generic and predictable but not unwarranted.  It’s all just fine, it works.

It is a video game.

We don’t even have the what ifs to fall back on.  The woes of what could have been and the deep dive of how it could have been saved, because we already have it.  It’s called Dying Light.  They took Dead Island and added a better movement system, smoother animations, and a more cohesive story.  Dying Light still shares many of Dead Island’s flaws, hell it shares a lot of assets too, but Dying Lights focused changes to the formula elevate the gameplay loop and the game follows.  It still has a hollow story, mixed themes and so forth.  But it has an identity all of its own.  While Dead Island sort of just wallows in its own mediocrity.

So we have the upgrade.  We have seen what happens when the gameplay is given the attention it deserves and doesn’t just widely chase after trends.  So where does that leave Dead Island?  It seems to have been made completely redundant.

There is literally no reason to come play this game anymore.  Dying Light doesn’t have anything to do with Dead Island lore or storywise.  And I guarantee there is nothing Dead Island does better than Dying Light in any capacity.  

If Dead Island was a bad game that everyone hated then maybe it would at least have something to latch onto.  It could act as some sort of warning or it could be a demonstration of the duality of art or something.

What’s even the point?  Is it even art anymore?  If it’s not then it would have something to say, being a sort of post-modern piece.  But if it is it has nothing to say and nothing to give.  A nothing piece of art.  This in and of itself would warrant some kind of discussion.  Some sort of acknowledgment.

But it doesn’t.  Because it’s fine.  Just, fine.

things i liked
1)the more you used a weapon type, you get more efficient with that type.  however, did not seem that useful since my character got bonus for edge weapons as a base, it made little sense to try to upgrade other types, except for guns.
2)gameplay seem a bit tighter.

things that got worse
1)the boat was annoying to use but you  have no choice but to use it from time to time 
2)a lot of fetch quests, fine, but now you can't always find quest items from the map.  it gives you vague zone and you gotta comb through to find what you need.  a waste of time.

I played the original way back, beat it and overall enjoyed the title, well..

Lets complete the second entry here to finish the whole package.. I maybe got to the village, did some quests.. beat up some zombies and..

This game honestly sucks, it has not aged well and there are a ton of weird hit detection issues, boring assets from the first game, missions are dumb and boring.

I beat dying light a while back and would just recommend that over this significantly.

This is ok but with so many zombie survival just play something else.

1. Poor Map design, especially the first area that made me actively wanna skip quests because of the swamps.
2. It's either you one shot or get one shot.
3. Horrible money economy + complete lack of loot
4. Terrible enemy balance, way too many of them in certain areas + the special infected are scarce, in fact a decent chunk are only discover-able in the very end.
5. Final boss was difficult because of how hard i was laughing at the shitty cutscenes in between phases. They didn't even bother making the boss look different each phase, only made 'em slightly bigger.
6. Buggy as hell, like quests not progressing, explosives not damaging enemies or the random echo noise you hear for no reason just about everywhere.
7. When you finish a side quest step it auto tracks a main quest instead of moving on to the next step of the side quest
8. The 'find it yourself through the green circle that's in the map' quests got annoying.
9. Special infected went from too squishy to bullet sponges that annihilate you in a few smacks. 


1. Defense quests were nice.
2. Generous XP that really helped flesh out character building.
3. AOE attack weapon mods.

While getting a multiplayer game going is now a breeze, the game is a port from the consoles -- so the physics, combat, performance, visuals, and other factors are definitely below-par.

What you get is a survival/combat, open world, story experience in the vein of Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento; complete with their inherent cheapness.  It is better optimized than the first remastered title, and you get the option of playing a new & unique 5th character, or even porting your previous character from the first 'Definitive' title.

Only really worth it on sale, due to the handicapping of combat (the game is locked on 'digital') -- if you have a friend or 3 available, it does offer a meaningful co-op campaign experience.

I love the meme factor of dying without rhyme or reason, or panicking ""he's got a knife!!"" knowing if it's thrown at me & hits I'm 1 shot. sometimes it's genuinely frustrating, but I get over it rather quickly. imo losing money isn't an automatic death sentence, it's rather simple to get nice weaponry and resources with or without money as the environment is often bustling with items to collect.

- Every basic enemy can kill you in 1 hit, which is wonderful :) Losing all you money on a basic enemy
- Executions are glitchy af
- Terrible combat. Your screen shakes like it has an epileptic attack or seizure once you get hit/hit someone else
- Probably the worst parkour in gaming history
- Half of boats for travelling are not working
- Level system is completely useless, since you still scale same as your enemies do
- NO SETTINGS AT ALL - You can't change FOV, can't go to 3rd person in vehicle, can't do a fucking shit
- Big enemies like Thug are completely bullet(hit)sponge. You are probably gonna waste more money in medkits than you can earn from the enemy himself
- Terrible map desighn

The game has a similar plot length as the first one and has the same price. It is advertised as DLC because Riptide doesn't have any improvement apart for a few details. They knew they'd get lots of negative critics for selling a new game with same bugs, on the same unimproved engine.

I value in games the stories they’re telling and again as in the first DI, we’ve got a fail here. There is an unused potential for a great screenplay, but instead we are given not very amusing tasks with an intriguing ending. One good idea is enough for a road RPG game, but not enough for continuous story.

New game, old bugs:
– The game has a problem with zombie-zombie collisions. Don’t be surprised when you will be fighting a big special infected and suddenly you get hit by an another regular one running through it like a ghost through a wall. It can be really annoying in close quarters when you think you can fight one zombie coming out of the door, but two others think the door is not blocked and merge on each other;
- Zombies sometimes are having problem with locating the player and chase him in opposite direction;
- Zombies spawns in front of you, especially often when you’re steering a boat.
- If you have a higher ground and you throw a molly onto your enemies, you still take damage if the fire is directly underneath you (no matter how high you are above it);
- Not working map marker – you can mark a waypoint on your map, but it only shows you directions when you’re 50 meters away, meaning you don’t need it anymore. Quest markers are working properly.
- Annoying constant talks of NPCs when you're at the camps. Annoying is not the fact that they always talk every single time you pass them, but the fact they're keep on talking when you take new quests and they won’t stop until they finish their lines. This was especially buggering at the hospital where you can find a girl that has long, slow-going lines. Everything would be fine if the game could turn their voices down a little.
- Our playable characters can talk even if they die.

A new attack has been added to the game, but sadly it’s still a beta version of the idea. So, you have to press ‘F’ when you are on a higher ground than the enemy to make your character jump-kick on them and do them with one hit. It’s useless if you have more zombies, because after the attack you cannot move for 3 seconds – enough to get slaughtered. It happened to me many times I didn’t hit anything but landed next to the zombie, even though I didn’t have any fence or anything in front of me. Another time I was overrun so I used the ladder to get myself into safety and started eating snacks, but because it’s the same button instead of grabbing an apple Xian jumped back to the horde. This skill should be removed.

The game was created for co-op, but the animations are still crippled. Our characters jump like they’d swallow a broomstick – with legs in move but standstill torso. Well, what are we talking about – it’s 2013 and they still used separate head/torso elements so they were forced to use the old trick with covering the visible line with necklaces/beads/scarves/others

I am aware this ""review"" is just pointing out the disadvantages, but I didn't have much fun playing for the second time the same game. You can now reach lvl 70, but the skills are basically the same.

The first Dead Island is far more playable, this felt like a rushed DLC. The amount of glitches you experience in combat makes the game feel unplayable once you get 60% through. The city segments have zombies EVERYWHERE. When you spawn after dying, you'll be thrown into the middle of MORE ZOMBIES who often will trap you in the corner you spawned in and kill you again. If there are too many, they'll attack at odd intervals and interrupt any attempts at defending yourself. I've been trying to get the Super-Fish for about an hour and I can't figure out how to stop getting spawn killed, I was taking damage while my character was still spawning in, I could not even move and by the time i could, it was 1 hit until i died again.

Never played a PC game with this amount of issue breaking bugs
I had insane amount of fps lag at times even after messing with my computer and in game settings
I had zombie spawning glitches and runners hitting me from insane distances
I had several moments I would get out of my vehicle and die instantly
I had moments where I try to run over zombies and they would just go over or around my vehicle through some weird glitch

I'm not sure if this is due to my difficulty, but it never felt like leveling up really helped me take on tougher zombies
The story had moments where I said ... damn this really didn't make sense
I really wanted to like this game and apart of me still enjoyed playing
The new zombies were really creative and I loved the map layout
I felt Dead Island Riptide was able to keep a lot of the old things that made the first game great

.
Plot is resuming what happened directly from the first one, goal is still to survive and escape which I think along the way is still too bland. I usually play these kinds of games with side quests are almost and always cleared first before doing the main mission, turns out they're dull too same as the main one, at least you can farm and level up your stats this way.
.
From the perspective of single player, oh this is a new mechanic that you + 10 other survivors have to deal with, they certainly gonna help along t he way, but nope they only help in certain defense tower (kindoif) mission. What's the point of that?
.
Progressing through the game, it's kinda hard even importing your character from the previous game (yes you can import your character save from the previous game, this is pros). And the game only gets much fun when it's coming towards the endgame for me.

TL;DR There are even less redeeming qualities than the original game. Voice acting, cutscenes, gameplay, and level design are all rough. This was a cash grab copy-paste of the original but everything is worse.

[b][u]STORY[/u][/b]
You escaped the island of Banoi in the last game, now you crashed ship on another island you have to make your way off of.

[b][u]GAMEPLAY[/u][/b]
The gameplay here is the same but worse from the previous game. It is copy-pasted, but with all bugs and trash mechanics still intact. The main quests are broken, and the island is so difficult to navigate around without getting PO'd. Here is what I had to say about the last one:

  ""[i]The gameplay for Dead Island is buggy, annoying, and so stale that the 4-year-old piece of popcorn under your couch tastes fresher in comparison... Quests are ridiculously boring because you are fetching something 98% of the time.

  You are going to quickly realize how horribly executed every mechanic in this game is. Fast stamina depletion extend playtime WAY too much... Weapons purposely break after 20-30 swings. Repairing your busted up weapons requires [b]money[/b] instead of resources. You will lose all of your money you just earned from missions and exploration.

  ...Skill tree design is actual trash and barely helpful for your character. Also, don't get me started on the gunplay. All I will say is the guns in this game are pellet guns with inferior ammo reserves (I think your max ammo capacity is 3-clips worth - THATS IT).

  The zombies can be so frustrating. Normal zombies chucking weapons like boat paddles at you is probably the most infuriating thing in the game. The damage stats on the weapons they throw are extremely low, yet they knock you down and take 75% of your health in one hit. ""Thugs"" and ""Tanks"" knock you down and deplete your health drastically with every hit. You will find yourself avoiding them when you can rather than taking them down.[/i]""

[b][u]SOUND[/u][/b]
This game kept the same sound effects and music from the original. The voice acting is quite possibly far worse than the first, which I didn't know was possible. The only decent voice acting is once again done by Phil LaMarr (Sam B).

[b][u]GRAPHICS/VISUALS[/u][/b]
The setting here is awful. The beach area was the only enjoyable setting from the first Dead Island, while the jungle section was horrible to trudge through. The jungle setting is the majority of this game and it is worse than before.

[b][u]OVERALL[/u][/b]
Even less enjoyable than the original Dead Island. Again, the only fun part of this is playing it and making fun of it with friends. We got so infuriated with this one we quit after 2 hours. I will not be returning to this one either.

""Polish a turd it is still a turd"" comes to mind. All flash and no substance. 

Took stuff out, put some things in, driving still sucks, running and walking around is janky as. Not very keyboard friendly, feels like a console port. Having to press buttons multiple times when in other games I only need one or 2 different button presses to get to the quest I want or change a weapon etc etc. Even on consoles it is easy to get through the menus to switch weapons but this is constantly stressful. 

Lacks any emotional response from me when every other game manages to get some sort of response like feeling sorry for the characters. I just want to kill everyone and put them out of their misery this game is so depressing. Other depressing games I want to save people even if they die in the end scenes etc but this is like...nope...nuke em all let God sort them out. 

No difficulty sliders. Forced to do arbitrary side quests to upgrade your ""friends"" and helpers so they have a sliver of hope of surviving nonsense tower defence style fight scenes. Feel like I'm forced to play the original just to learn the game and enemy types, throws MORE enemy types in the 2nd game. Feels like artificial difficulty increase for the sake of it without even testing if anyone wants it. 

TLDR - Game was exciting in the first game, got bloated like a floater in the second and became a huge chore in making sure everyone has the best stuff at all times to survive. Looks really pretty on the surface but dig deeper and it's like trying to hold your intestines in while Zombies are literally eating them.",1641190100,1641190100,False,4,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

Riptide seems to have had smaller budget and/or less time for development. The game is more traditional open world with only 2 maps, but much more stuff to do in them. The jungle is a much more interesting version of the bases game's jungle, and Henderson is... a much more interesting version of Moresby, especially visually. Sprinkled throughout the maps are small instanced, what I like to call, challenge rooms. They are full of zombies and a boss. Unleashing a fully maxed out Fury on them is recommended, repetitive... but also tons of fun, each and every time you do it.
Seems to be less serious that the original. It shows even in the main theme being more... funky I would say. There's also the quest for the horror director who, of course, does not care about his crew and just wants to finish shooting his movie.
The player characters are much more vocal this time, instead of going just ""uh huh"", ""yes"", ""of course"", when accepting quests, they actually talk with people.
Gameplay wise the import function and additional levels allow you to create a truly overpowered character, full power fantasy. However, since this occurs over the course of two games, I think it's perfectly fine.
Several new mechanics have been added, unfortunately most of them are very janky. The Charge skill sometimes pulverizes an enemy, other times it leaves it with a sliver of health, and there are times where it misses completely and you are barreling down a cliff. The Jump Attack often either misses or gets you stuck, and the ""get-off-my-boat"" QTE makes the zombies fly away as if hit by a Falcon Punch. This really could have been ironed out in this remaster.
There are also problems with sound, where it cuts off. It happens with stationary miniguns, mine explosions, and Fury for some characters. I've tried numerous solutions, but none worked.
There's a village in the game where tons of assets are misaligned. We are speaking about dozens of trash cans clipping into buildings, fruit floating, crates sinking into ground. There is so much of it, it is literally impossible to miss just by playing the game normally. It's embarrassing. Since I have not played the original version, I wonder whether it's the Definitive Edition's fault.

Overall, I had more fun with Riptide than with the base game, despite all of the jank and technical issues. It seems to be focused more on pure fun in great environments/locations.",1639485895,1639485895,True,19,1,0.679944694042205811,0,True,False,False

Knowing what those were all about, I can say that the ""Definitive Edition"" is without a doubt the inferior version of this already-flawed series. Both main games are buggy, seem to have some minor content bits cut out, and have fixed none of the long-standing issues with this franchise.

The original [i]Dead Island: Riptide[/i] was virtually a carbon-copy of the original, but it did have some technical optimizations that made it more playable. This ""improved"" version looks worse than the original version. Like with the rest of this edition, it looks like someone smeared Vaseline all over the screen. The games look so dated and second-rate compared to other remasters out there.

[i]Dead Island: Riptide[/i] did have a few minor quality of life improvements over the original. However, despite that, its main flaws still remained the same. The biggest issues with this game, like with the original [i]Dead Island[/i], are in the movement and combat systems. They are clunky, slow, unpolished, and buggy. Aiming and shooting guns is weird and not fun. The hitboxes and detection stinks. Melee weapons break far too easily and guns run out of ammo too quickly. The stamina system is annoying as well. To make matters even worse, melee combat is hindered by the cluggy, slow movement speed of your character that makes dodging or avoiding the powerful zombie attacks virtually impossible, which is problematic considering that you can't take much damage before going down. It's especially an issue when you're facing larger hordes or special zombies in tight, enclosed areas.

The story supposedly picks up right where the original [i]Dead Island[/i] left off, but it mostly ends up going in its own direction real quick, which is a drag because the directions that this game takes are god-awful. The new characters feel like clones of the ones from the original and Palanai isn't too different than Banoi in terms of feel. The story in this game essentially contradicts a lot of what you know from the last game (e.g. the virus still lives within you in dormancy even though the head scientist in the last game clearly stated that it died when you got exposed to it) and it goes on a dumb tangent about roentgens, mutagens, and whatnot - all of which I guess are intended to justify the utter crapshow of an ending it all culminates in (hint: all of your work and frustration across these two games may very well be for absolutely nothing).

Unfortunately, the ""Definitive Edition"" is the only version for sale on Steam anymore, which is kind of a shame, as the Definitive Edition isn't the superior version. It brings its own issues to the table in a franchise that's perhaps best known for its issues to begin with. If you really want it, get it on sale; otherwise, I'd recommend passing it up until then.

[i]Dead Island: Riptide[/i] is more of the same if you liked the original game. You can even port in your character profile(s) from the first game, which will give you a significant leg-up going in. Killing zombies is fun when the game's systems work as intended, but it doesn't take much for them to fail you. There are a few new zombie types thrown into the mix, but they don't really add much (if any) value to the overall game. Questing is the same as in the original game and its just as repetitive and tedious. Ultimately, it all gets old before long.

[b]Final Score:[/b] 4/10

It's more of the same that one expects coming off the first [i]Dead Island[/i] game, but it soon gets old and the long-standing issues with this franchise will soon leave your hair thinner than the zombies in the game.",1637744427,1637744427,False,2,1,0.479044705629348755,0,True,False,False

It looks and plays the same as the previous DI games, an open-world, zombie action survival game. Due to the naming of the title, many people assume Riptide is another version of Dead Island, but it's not, it's actually a sequel which takes place almost directly after the ending of the main game. You can even import your character, retaining your level and skills, but not inventory. There's a new character, but if you wanna try him out you must start from level 1.

In Riptide you explore a whole new area, but it continues the ""vacation island"" theme. In my opinion, the areas of this game looks better and feels more coherent compared to the areas in the first game, although there's no hotel level which for me is the most memorable part. This game is also shorter, about 2/3 or even half of the length DI, which is actually preferable since DI kinda overstays its welcome. Sadly both games share a poorly-done finale, where you must fight through hordes of zombies inside a linear, claustrophobic building to get to the escape vehicle. There's also less human enemies here, which is ironically my favorite fights in the main game.

One major improvement about this game is how it treats the characters. Playable characters have more personalities, like each of them have unique dialogue when talking to characters rather than some generic variations of ""yes/no"". The non-chosen characters also hang around the other survivors instead of not appearing at all, and you can do some item collecting quests for them to improve their power while fighting in base defense missions. Side characters are also more fleshed-out, although sadly there's not enough character models so many side and minor characters look similar.

The problems I have with this game is mostly the same with the first one: very poor optimization, hardy zombies + fragile weapons, far away fast travel spots, and too many sidequests are fetch quests. But the improvements are also great, I feel more attached to the characters due to them having more personalities and the maps are not as large so travelling around isn't very tedious. Although sadly both this game and the original version doesn't have any story DLC, it only has some exclusive weapons and a barely-noticeable costume change.

Personally, I think Dead Island: Riptide is the better game compared to Dead Island, due to more likable characters, better level design and setting, more enemy variations, and a more coherent story. But even with the story recap at the beginning, you should still play the first one. If you like open-world action games and/or zombie games, give the Dead Island franchise a try. Even if you dislike the first game, it gets better here.",1636284088,1636284088,True,27,0,0.76658165454864502,0,True,False,False

*disclaimer* : This review is from a single player perspective.

Firstly let me emphasize that the entire game reuses assets from the first one. Everything from the combat quality (or lack of) to the clunky movement, driving, most weapons and so on. They've made no effort to enhance the game past the last engine. 

Secondly, they dug the hole even deeper when it comes to everything done wrong in the first game. to clarify,almost all the quests in my almost 8 hours of playtime have been ""fetch"" quests, while the entire group of 10+ survivors rely completely upon you to do all of their dirty work while they trash talk you in the process. Furthermore, the terrain is even trickier to navigate, with many swamps where you can only walk slowly while zombies run at full speed, and narrow roads, making it very annoying to get from one place to another. 

To conclude, in my opinion they have lost the plot with this one. The first game, despite the downsides, had a certain charm to it which this game lacks completely. It almost seems like they were trying to milk every last penny in their original asset pack and put together this mess to cash it in.

Story:

This game can be thought of more like a massive expansion or DLC for the original games as you still have the same playable characters (in addition to an extra one). Furthermore, you can import a character you used in the original Dead Island where you will retain the same level and perks you chose on the skill tree. The game quite literally picks up from where the last one ended, except this time you have a brand new Island to explore consisting of a huge jungle and city. There maybe less maps than the original game, but these two maps are pretty big in themselves. The story still focuses on the idea of finding the cause of this outbreak and a vaccine to stop it. I won't spoil the ending, but I liked the twist at the end and how this linked into the gameplay mechanic of 'fury' established in the previous games. 

Gameplay:

One thing that struck me in this game was how the level system had been revamped! There are a few new perks to collect such as 'group fury' where you can deal additional damage to zombies if you activate 'fury' whilst fighting with your group in the solo campaign. There is a lot more emphasis on 'holding out' against a hoard of zombies to protect your base in this game as well as the traditional 'going out' and doing errands as well. Another thing that is different is that you can specialise in a certain weapon such as throwing knifes, blunt weapons, fire weapons etc. So the more you use, say, throwing knifes, the more you will level that up and the more benefits your will get out of it such as reduced stamina usage. 

Other than that the game plays like before, with a few extra types of zombies that pose a threat to the player. I started this game at level 35 with Sam B (imported from Dead Island) and finished him on level 65 as there is level scaling where the zombies level up with you so they are always posing a threat to the player. 

Overall, I really loved the Dead Island series. I can't wait for Dead Island 2 to be released sometime in the future (hopefully, Deep Silver release Dead island 2 on Steam and not just keep it on one platform as an exclusive like they are doing with some of their other games). For now, I will just need to content myself with Techland's Dying Light!",1635065348,1635065348,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Riptide takes place after the events of the original Dead Island, where immediately after being rescued you crash onto another island that is very identical to the first one and go through a story that is forgettable and uninteresting. You play as the original 4 characters from the first game and a fifth new one who specializes in fighting with his bare hands and not a weapon which sounds like it could be cool, however I constantly kept finding weapons as a better source of damage so most of his skills were pointless. The main 4 characters have exactly the same skill trees as the last game aside from a couple additional skills which really adds to my thought of huge parts of the game being copy and pasted. Even the character models for the NPCs look just like characters from Dead Island aside from maybe a different colored shirt.
So even though most of the game is copy and pasted from the original they did add a couple new features. The biggest selling point was that you could perform tasks to improve the characters at your camp so that when you need to fight off hordes of zombies, they’ll be stronger and better equipt. However, this only ever comes up like two or three times and there really isn’t much of a difference in their abilities during these fights since you’ll end up doing most of the work anyway. Aside from that they also added boats as a vehicle since the new island is mostly flooded, but they basically handle like the cars do and honestly having a slightly different vehicle as a reason to buy the sequel is not a good selling point.
Where Dead Island Riptide falls apart the most for me is the combat and the bugs. The combat is somehow more broken than it was in the original game. There are several cheap deaths in the game where if a zombie is holding an item and threw it at me, I died instantly with no way to react. The special and bosses are also annoying because they used the lazy dev method of “take a regular enemy and give them a bunch of health”, except it’s one step further where minutes would pass by of me hitting the same enemy over and over again. It never felt satisfying to take down these difficult enemies, every time I saw them and knew I needed to fight it just felt like an absolute chore. There are also major bugs in spawning where several groups of zombies will spawn on top of each other so I’ll go from fighting a couple zombies to a group of 10.
Overall, this is really not a good game at all. It’s very clear that it was rushed out to cash in on the Dead Island hype with its majority of copy and pasted assets and mechanics, completely boring and forgettable story, sheer amount of bugs in the game and complete lack of anything new and exciting to make this game worth playing. If you really loved Dead Island then play the original, because honestly this feels like a half-finished, watered down version of the original.

I wanted to take a break from Dead Island after the first game left me unsatisfied. But no, since I already installed Riptide alongside it, I decided to get it out of the way, so I'll have better horror games to play during October.

And little did I know: Dead Island Riptide manages to be better than the first game - not by a huge margin, but a noticeable one.

The world is more condensed than before and that actually works in its favour. Instead of several, mid-tier size maps, you instead get two large ones, each with a few subzones. That way the world itself feels more open for experimentation. Another huge draw for me was to play as the same character with the same level and abilities as in the first game. That way, I found my way around immediately and got to experiment with skills I hadn't chosen before. 

Gameplay this time involves a few missions where you defend your base from hordes of zombies. You also get new special infected, including mini bosses, who drop better loot on defeat. And in addition of a car, you can now also get around with a boat, at least in the first half. The obligatory city level is a lot more appealing this time, with parts being flooded and a mined out military base. 
Otherwise...it's just more Dead Island. You collect weapons, fight zombies, modify weapons and fight more zombies. And it relies heavily on fetch quests, so get ready to do lots of those.

Dead Island Riptide is a smaller game and I'm not complaing on that. It's brief, but far less annoying than the first game. Wait for a discount, though.",1631573110,1631573110,True,16,1,0.691878914833068848,0,True,False,False

Pros vs left4dead:
- not so bad graphics and physics
- item creation, upgrade and trade system
- large and sophisticated inventory system
- more quests and story

Cons vs left4dead:
- character motor and animations could have been much better
- no AI to make your team play with you on single player (major bummer)
- some special effects can use a lot of improvment (particle systems etc)

pros vsdying light:
- being able to transport quest items in cars/boats
- story is a bit more consistent and interactive

cons vs dying light:
- no parkour and limited character abilities
- graphics much much outdated
- maps much smaller
- environment much less interactive

In the first half our i felt a bit of regret for buying it, but after that things got better and game is fun to play,
 but honestly they could have done much better in the area of inventory management and overall game physics.

Bottom line, despite some drawbacks, the game is worthy of playing and would probably appeal to anyone who's into survival games.",1628519874,1628519874,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

The 'open world' of Riptide is horrible, frequently requiring vehicles or fully repaired weapons to traverse without being hampered by unlimited respawning zombies. If you didn't quit by the first area, the map opens up much more, and the fury boost does negate the endless hordes, by providing you an unlimited use ticket to murder for free. 

Quest design is laughable, with the game only consisting of fetch, escort and secure area objectives. Story is no better, and is not a good continuation of the original. Gun balance is out of the question, 1-4 shots on every enemy without durability, and free fountains of ammunition around the map. Exploration is confusing and poorly mapped, underground areas should be more clearly displayed as such. 

The only positives I found are, it's another Dead Island game and DI2 hasn't come out yet, I can turn my brain off and still finish it, and it didn't crash.

The combat mechanics were not at all easy... this said after almost 60 hours of gameplay. I often found myself defenseless no matter how many points I put into my stamina and hand to hand combat. Keep in mind, this entire time, I was playing a character whose strength was firearms; I didn't find a single gun or blueprint for one (and I was looking for them too) until I was at least 80% through the game. Even after finding the blueprints and ultimately finishing the game, I was never able to craft ammo for myself.
The boss fights were a bit ridiculous considering that most of the creatures were not ones I'd come across before and therefore had no way to beat. I ended up looking up a lot of things on the internet before going into boss fights because my Casebook wasn't up to date with what I was about to face. 
Finally, no spoilers included; this was one of the most let down, disappointing, rage inducing ending I've ever experienced in a game. To me, it was an intense let down after everything I'd gone through.  
All in all, I think that the game had a lot of potential for what it COULD have been, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it or even play it again.",1625290022,1625290022,False,9,1,0.477642089128494263,0,True,False,False

The definitive edition truly didn't bring much.
It pretty much is just the exactly same game.
Sure, some visuals got an upgrade, but yeah.
This wasn't a free upgrade, It was expensive.
I bought the collection with riptide included.
The original owners had a discount for that.
It was around 9€ in total, I don't remember.
The level of improvement is very small, tho.
You could get mods for the original games.
Those mods also improved the visual style.
But unlike this, they were free to download.
Was this definitive upgrade worth it? Nope.
I just do not think it was a worthy upgrade.
It feels more like a cash-grab to be honest.
Nowadays you can't buy the originals, tho.
Therefore: It's great for all the new players.
Paying for the same games twice isn't fun.
Especially if there isn't anything truly new.

 There is a huge performance lag and stuttering even in high end computers for years and that is the main reason I haven’t been able to play this game more than quarter of its story since it has first came out. I also managed to fix the problem to some extend by starting the game with Nvidia graphics. However, there still seems to be a bit of visual performance problem because of the game itself.

 Other than that, If you played the first game and liked it, the only thing you may find here could be disappointment. Sure it can be a very nice game If you have friends to play. I can start the game play it 3 hours and get legendary weapons and unique thing, improve them to the max and stuff like that. Money is everywhere. The merchants are stacked. However, no matter how far I decrease the quality, performance still seems to have a problem. 

 The game is very short compared to the first one. The ambient is not as good because of being in a constant forest. Not like there are slums, hotel floors or anything concrete, just sand, water, plants, trees and even more plants.
There are a lot more firearm, a lot more bombs and a bit more melee weapons. Oh, and also there is a new character who is similar to Wolverine but with a staff. There are one or two extra skills added for the main character in the first game.
I was so hyped for this game when it first came out because like, I LOVED the first game. And I was very good in the first game. I would do an area attack even though I don’t have an area attack (in the first game). Maybe that was why I got so disappointed. This one was very much like a DLC of the first game. 

 All in all, I do not recommend riptide but I hella do recommend the first game.

ENDING DISCUSSED. DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED.

Rating at time of release = 8/10
Rating for current day = 5-6/10

I would've given this game a thumbs up back in the day of its original release, but time has not treated this title well. It was pretty good for its era, but time has done it no favors and other games (Dying Light is a prime example) show just how much of a difference a few years makes for this genre and how a more polished, finished-feeling game can hold up over time much better.

===REVIEW===
I really wanted to enjoy this game the way I did years ago when I played this game on my laptop, but I just couldn't. This game comes across as a rushed out sequel that has barely anything new to bring to the table, and the things it does bring to the table feel rushed and unpolished. Here is a list of the things (some in both titles, others only present in this title) that made this game about a 6/10 for me.

1. Movement system (Present in both games)
The movement system in this game makes it feel like the entire map is an ice rink. I understand the concept of momentum and what not, but the way it was incorporated just felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable. Having your character slide around like they're running on a soapy ice rink is extremely unfun, and it made fighting things like infected and butchers extremely unfun, since the act of them running into you alone is enough to make you want to pull your hair out.

2. AI Mechanics/Defend Location scenarios (Riptide Exclusive)
I don't remember it being this bad, but MAN do the ""defend the location"" parts suck so bad. Half the time your AI allies are bumping into you and causing you to go flying (goes hand in hand with issue 1), and they serve merely to be a distraction 90% of the time as opposed to actually being decent defense. These parts felt extremely unpolished, as it felt more of a ""run around and finish off a cluster of zombies while your ""allies"" serve as punching bags for 10-15 minutes"" instead of an actual, solid defense objective.

3. Game feels like it was designed around porting in old character/early game imbalance (Riptide Exclusive)
The original Dead Island felt a lot better in this regard, as leveling up actually took a bit of time and you couldn't get strong perks from the get go. In Riptide, the fact alone that you start at level 15 is more than enough to prove this point, but I'll take it one step further. Early game was significantly more difficult in the original, but Riptide early game is a joke. My most recent playthrough as John (just finished it earlier today) could not have been any easier than it was, and that is because you can get stupid strong perks right as you get off the ship. Critical hit perks in and of themselves are enough to make you a walking one man army (due to being able to kick a zombie down, punch each of their arms once, and instantly kill them), and the leveling pace is significantly faster. By the end of the original (did just about every side quest I came across in every region I came to), I believe I was in the mid 30s with a modest assortment of perks. By the end of Riptide (I rushed through the story and disregarded a lot of side quests), I was over level 50 with nearly maxed out combat skills and nearly maxed out survival (disregarded fury because it's easy as hell to get by without it). 

4. Combat was extremely annoying compared to the first (Riptide Exclusive)
This may have been a John exclusive issue, but it felt extremely annoying to fight anything. One punch sends them flying, and having to swing my mouse back and forth to keep up with how much knockback there was when fighting felt extremely tedious. It made me want to engage in LESS combat, since every fight just felt like punching them once, them falling down, and me beating them senseless all over the place until they died.

5. New enemy types are frustrating (Riptide Exclusive)
A lot of the new enemy types (excluding the grenadier, since it's a joke for the most part) are extremely annoying to deal with. The screamer is basically an infected with faster attack speed and the ability to stun you for 5 seconds, drowners were designed to make the boat sections annoying as hell (as if the boat sections weren't bad enough), and wrestlers are just more time-consuming thugs. The new enemy types just felt like a way to introduce more unpolished content, as the screamer's design doesn't even make any sense (why do they look like they belong in a Resident Evil game and not a quasi-apocalyptic zombie game?), the drowner is just a region-specific infected, and the wrestler is just a harder to kill thug.

6. Ending (specifically the boss fight) sucked
The story in and of itself had so many ""out of left field"" twists that had no build-up to them (Harlow was a good person, then a terrorist trying to steal the vaccine, then a good person trying to destroy anything related to the virus) (The virus was caused by the natives, then it was a bio-weapon, then it was basically a seasonal flu, then it was a bio-weapon again). On top of that, the final boss fight literally just felt like a way to f*** the heroes, as the fight was terrible and it was a cheap excuse to get the heroes to inject themselves with the mutagen and set up the ""cliffhanger"" at the end of the game. The only choice when fighting Harlow was to just spam M1 in her face (since you couldn't outrun her without jumping off of the upper catwalks) until the end phase where you get god mode and just spam M1 in her face (once again) until she dies. 

===SUMMARY===
I'm sure there's plenty of other things I forgot, but this was the majority of the problems I had with the game. Again, I understand that this is a game from 2013 and games have come a long way since then, but that still doesn't change the fact that the original holds up better over time (in my opinion) than Riptide and games like Dying Light hold up tremendously more than either of the two titles.",1621138133,1621138133,False,0,1,0.398312479257583618,0,True,False,False

Bugs galore, every bug in the original is in this one it feels like, several quest did not work for my friend and I ( literally couldn't even accept the quest or turn in another). Survivor base teleports around as you progress in the story, as far as I can tell you lose all side quests pertaining to the previous location in some instances with no warning about that, also fun.

Things more or less come close to insta respawn, on the flip side this makes earning exp and money trivial, on the other hand it gets kinda old reclearing the area just because you took a few steps outside.

Weak story, boring / samey characters with one or two lines that get repeated constantly at you every second you move past some one,  And the final things to add would be both maps are pretty terrible, boats suck, surprisingly  short game time as well assuming if you can even do all your quests with out them bugging out.",1605233310,1619138684,False,3,0,0.534128427505493164,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed the original Dead Island for what it was. A decently fun gore-fest RPG that had you mindlessly doing fetch quests and slaughtering zombies. I was excited to try Riptide because it appeared to be more of the same with the addition of more content.  

Much of the same problems I had with the original are still here. The game does not run all that well, the FOV is abysmal (CAMERA SHAKE) and the lack of basic information about weapon stats and upgrades is still here. Several times the audio would just bug out during fights and this happened A LOT. For some reason they included weapon proficiency...but I was never able to figure out what they did. I find this to be lazy of Tech Land as it was a frustrating aspect, they could have easily fixed. This game feels like an expansion more so than a standalone game. If you do not import a character, then you can start off with a level 15 character (for some reason) and they have included a 5th playable character. 

The game’s first act was enjoyable, you spend almost half the game on the mainland of the island. It’s a mix of jungle/bayou and introduces you to the personal quest system. It returned me to the fun parts of the original game where you can explore and drive all around the island. The island has been hit with a storm, so you must fight against the sluggish controls while slowly wading through water. The addition of a boat doesn’t really fix this as Tech Land made sure to introduce an annoying zombie type that quite literally spawns in midair and attempts to knock you off the boat (Get used to doing a quick time event 5-6 times in a row). The boat is buggy, and ramming does not work. The other new additions are some copy and pasted boss rooms, small horde battles during the quest (more on that later) and personal quests to upgrade your survivors. I had a lot of fun with upgrading the team and their ability to handle zombies does seem to increase the more you upgrade them. However, as you enter Henderson, the game just stops being fun. Henderson is a boring maze-like city only filled with repetitive side quests. You spend the latter half here and really everything you were doing in the first half sort of gives way to these repetitive tasks. Don’t even get me started on the ending. The final boss is hilariously bad. The story overall was bad. The Indigenous woman (Yoraba?) and your helicopter pilot from the original literally walk of camera and are never heard from again. 

I don’t really recommend it unless you really enjoyed the original and are willing to stick through a worse version of Dead Island.",1616303395,1616303646,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons/Disappointments/Nitpicks: 

But what some of the reviews on this game says is true..

You'll be annoyed by the endless respawn of zombies and they'll overwhelm you at times 
Sure there are bugs and glitches but none that prevent you from progressing the story
At some point you'll kinda be annoyed about the amount of hp some of the bosses have sometimes.
Sure you can lvl up and upgrade your guns but its kinda of a chore to kill them, since it takes too long.
Don't play for the story lol

 Two things I'd like to point out, though. There's a LOT of camera shaking, as well as head bobbing. Neither of which can be toggled on/off in the menus. Some say altering the Field of View in the DI files helps, and perhaps it does to some degree, but it definitely isn't a full ""fix."" So that said, keep it in mind when buying this. It doesn't make it completely unplayable, i just recommend taking a pause every so often and look away from the screen.

 The other thing can apply to all characters, as they all can throw weapons, but mainly focuses on our throwing expert, Logan. Fun character. Love the Boomerang proc chance for returnable throws. Here's where some things can be hanky, however. When Boomerang fails to proc, thrown weapons behave how.... well, how they normally would. Bladed weapons impale, making it for easy retrieval when you can't bank on Boomerang procs. Blunt weapons, however.... At times upon impacting an enemy, Blunt weapons can often take a REALLY odd trajectory and, more than you'd care for, can land in unreachable areas. I've lost some decent Unique Legendary quality weapons this way.

 In short, both DI and DI:Riptide are great zombie slayers, even more so if motion sickness isn't an issue for you. Throwing weapons is a great tactic, especially when a character's build revolves around it, just try to avoid throwing weapons like Hammers and Baseball Bats.

Like it's truly a chore to play. I played the base game of Dead Island and it was also a tad boring in it's own right, but for some reason this game just went all the way in with the mediocrity, to such an extend that I felt the need to write a review to vent my frustrations.

The glaring flaw with this game is that the game's gameplay simply sucks. At a point it's just you hacking an ever increasing level of zombies and it never feels as if you're getting better gear or actually improving with the skill system in the game.

Another disappointing part of this game is that it's just unappealing to look at. Be it the eye straining motion blur and film grain (which can be disabled, but doesn't help) or the camera shake that just simply disorientates you every time you have to climb a ladder or when you're pushed down by a zombie.

Hopefully the story is good right? Wrong. Unfortunately the story is just a drag and never picks up steam, and the side characters makes it especially hard to not skip their conversations, close the game and play something else.

[b]What's it about?[/b]
Unlike Steam states, this is an up to 4 player co-op with 5 chars to choose from. It can also be played SP.
The mechanics and many other aspects are pretty similar to [i]Borderland 2[/i]. It is the sequel to [i]Dead Island.[/i]

[b] Compared to Dead Island:[/b]
[list]
[*]Thugs give you more of a fair chance melee-ing them.
[*]Rams are far less frequent.
[*]Cars still drive like tanks.
[*]I didn't like having to swap weapons non-stop in [i]Borderland 2[/i] while leveling up. The new weapon level system on its own would be a great idea. Sadly, it is just on top of the old weapon system from DI.
[/list]

[b]positive[/b]
[list]
[*]Ran apart from some audio glitches bug-free on Win10. Some weapons respawned multiple times in co-op.
[*]The island is beautiful and the level design is interesting.
[*]The zombie slashing is very satisfying.
[*]Huge plus: You have a choice whether to fight lieutenants in close combat or take them out from a safe distance.
[*]The voice actors do a decent job. They are a class above the rest of the game and make it enjoyable. Though their lines are still nothing special.
[*]Plays on Linux.
[/list]

[b]negative[/b]
It came out around the same time as [i]Borderland 2[/i] and has in my opinion nearly identical shortcomings, namely a forgettable story, lots of copy/paste and boring quests.
[list]
[*]Quests consist solely of fetch quests, area clearance and area defence, though you got a few co-op elements in it. The bodyguard quests from DI are gone.
[*]Z's respawn at the same rate and area on the spacious main island as on the far denser town, which is really tedious on the island.
[*]In many ways, you feel this could be a great game, if more time and money would have been invested. A good game to give to the fans really and let them fine-tune it. Fine-tuning is missing on skills and weapons.
[*]Durability on weapons adds to the tedious changing of weapons and has no benefit for the player IMHO.
[/list]

[b]Verdict[/b]

But after I came back to this game and revisited Riptide, I really found out how bad everything in this entire game is. There's zombies that can just insta kill you by throwing a knife at you, which is completely unavoidable, there's the fact that every zombie respawns when you leave the area, including any screamers or rams you previously killed, there's the fact that these characters can maybe swing there weapons 4 or 5 times before they're just standing there out of breath, and you get knocked to the floor, there's the durability on weapons, which after killing maybe 15 zombies, the weapon is no longer usable, you can get hit while going into cutscenes, get killed in cutscenes, or have zombies walking around in them. Also, most of the zombies they added into this game that weren't in the first one, is some of the worst content they could've possibly added. The screamer makes it to where your character just stands there for 5 seconds, letting all the zombies swarm around you and hit you while they're just holding their head, there's the dude with knives for arms, which looks cool, but is just some dude on crack who hits you enough times to use a medkit everytime you go to attack him, there's the horrible L4D boomer ripoff, which tanks hits, and throws up in a 360 degree radius, there's the wrestler, which is a horrible L4D2 charger ripoff, which is like the tank and the charger together, except completely useless, and there's also named zombies, which are purple skulls, which are usually several levels higher than you, and almost instantly killing you, (and NPC's). Also, there's almost nothing to spend your money on in this game, as none of the vendors sell anything useful. You find more useful gear on someone's lockbox in the middle of their bedroom. (Excluding the items given to you after a completed quest, those are usually good weapons.) Also, most of the story plots, could've been solved if anyone had some common sense in the entire game. We are out here trying to survive a zombie apocalypse, not make best pals and play patty cake in the California sun after it all blows over. The entire time I was just waiting for the game to end. I bought this game for me and a friend to play, but after about 20% in, he said the combat, story, and enemies were all so bad, he would never play it again. The achievement for beating this game is about 17%. and i'm not even surprised. Don't even get me started on the missions where you have to set up barricades, and defend against 4-5 waves of the zombie horde, and while you're doing all this, you need to defend the NPC's against zombies that have grabbed them, because they can't just push them off. If you're playing this game solo, every single NPC will have a zombie on them, that you have to get off, or you will fail the mission. Horrible story, horrible plot, horrible enemies, horrible game. I hate to say it since I enjoyed the first one a lot, but they really dropped the ball on this one, and judging by the 17% of people that have actually just finished the story, it looks like i'm not the only one who thinks like that.",1613044016,1613044016,False,50,11,0.605762839317321777,0,True,False,False

Zombies continually punch through you hitting them or kicking them which is a problem because no matter the weapon you use, your swing range seems pretty short, so you're constantly getting smacked around.

With a similar but in many ways different setting, new weapons, zombies, mods, and story; Riptide has a lot to offer. The experience let me see where the developers got their inspiration for Dying Light. Riptide allows you to run across rooftops, jump over obstacles and climb various things, plus a big part of Riptide takes place in the slums, similar to Dying Light. They even added a way to climb vines and rocks which I don't think was in Dead Island. It does a very amazing job of providing variety, switching the setting every few hours; one moment you're in the jungle, then you're in a sewer, on a rooftop, bungalow, theater, dock, laboratory... - this factor doesn't let the game get stale quick. This combined with constantly finding cool new weapons like snipers, revolvers, katanas, claws, swords, chainsaws, and a variety of mods really kept me going. The combat is the same as Dead Island, melee combat feels amazing while ranged combat is lacking in a lot of places; shooting with any type of gun doesn't feel rewarding and feels really heavy, but the melee combat is really, really well done. One of the main reasons I play a lot of zombie games is zombie variants, I love when there are a lot of interesting special infected to encouter and to beat the brains out of. Dead Island did zombie variants well, Riptide brings that to a whole other level adding more zombies like Drowners, Wrestlers, Grenadiers, Screamers, and other infected among the ones that were in Dead Island. That's a crazy ammount of variety. The cons of the game are sadly that it has a lot of bugs; sometimes a quest item you're looking for doesn't appear, items glitching through the map... The map itself and how it tracks quests is very annoying, I found myself getting lost more than I should. The story is also very bad, just like Dead Island, but it's not what you're playing the game for. The survivor AI is stupid af, if they bump into you during one of the parts where you have to hold your ground, you'll start bouncing around like a pin-ball. But, if you're willing to get past the bugs, you'll have a lot of fun in Riptide, I promise! :)",1607170486,1607170486,True,6,0,0.552325606346130371,0,True,False,False

So we had turned to another zombie franchise Dead Rising, but I'd found it a little tedious for reasons I can no longer remember exactly.  Anyway, playing with good online friends is a blast and we were part way through playing Dead Island when Riptide was released, so I bought it immediately, and started the single player campaign in between playing the 1st game with friends, but TBH, I found Riptide just didn't feel as good; so it was put aside for almost 7 years until this April,  when I'd first returned to Dead Island to play with three other online friends (I'd abandoned both games because of losing my best friend with whom I was playing the first game cooperatively eight years ago.

[b]Fast forward 7 years.[/b]

We'd thoroughly enjoyed the recent foray into Banai (playing it weekly for a few hours from last Nov 19 to April 20) & after completing all chapters decided to jump into Palanai together.  By this time Riptide had been re-released as the definitive edition, which I presume meant all the DLC from the original release had been incorporated, plus the  graphics had been overhauled. 

Although I loved the 1st game, my opinion of Riptide  has been totally reversed from my original thoughts.  Not only is it just as good as the original; Riptide has been upgraded to include some excellent changes such as item pick up's which in the first game were only available to the first player accessing the pick up or weapon locker; whereas in Riptide everyone gets to pick the item or weapon up; which in my opinion is much  fairer and leads to less rushing to get the decent weapons etc.  Also, when you first start, you already have some of the perks selected depending on which character you choose to play; e.g. the gun specialist Purna already has some Rage perks added, which give her extra shots when in rage mode. On top of this other challenges have been added that are completed in stages. As you progress, you are notified by messages on screen that you have attained a specific level in that particular challenge, for example cutting of a certain number of heads. When you complete aany challenge you are awarded XP towards your next level. 

We as a group are still only on chapter three of Riptide, and about to enter Henderson town once we've finished the last of the side quests in the first area, so I'll edit this short review at some point, once we've completed the game.  We found that if we played without one of the group the quests would become a little confusing because  whoever had missed the previous game would not have various  quests completed or have missed picking up a decent modification or other important item, and it often led to us having to repeat quests just so they could catch up. Sometimes it was also necessary to have completed a particular quest before you could  accept others.  So when we started Riptide we decided that if one of the group couldn't play, the remainder of the group would jump into one of the many other zombie games or other co-op games available.

The  original graphics were much the same as the first game, but the definitive edition  that included all the old DLC plus a graphics overhaul doesn't seem that different from the original Riptide.   Despite the games age it still looks great (IMO) despite many official reviews lambasting it for lacklustre graphics.  I've also noticed that when joining the shared game there isn't the same issues as with the 1st one, where if you didn't click on the space bar when the cut scene started, you'd have to sit through the whole scene, and often have to reboot the game before being able to join. 

The game play is similar to the original, apart from the pick up changes mentioned above,  there are new infected with different ways of attacking and although the maps are set in similar environments, the first three chapters based in Palanai & the flooded swamp land look a lot different than the  jungle map in the first game.  I can't comment on Henderson yet. It looks set out differently looking at it's [url=https://www.ign.com/maps/dead-island-riptide/henderson][b]interactive map[/b][/url], and from the images I see it looks more Spanish colonial and definitely different to Banoi town. There's a nice selection of side & repeatable quests that see's your group traversing the area in search of various quest items.  There's no through route for vehicles, so travelling in vehicles is not as enjoyable as the original game.  Overall my group are thoroughly enjoying the co-op experience  and  highly recommend the game to anyone who enjoys playing with friends, especially if you are connected via Discord as well.  As for the SP campaign,  I've only played the beginning & that was in the original version just after it had been released and before it was updated and given an HD overall.  At the time, as already mentioned, I wasn't impressed; but, losing one of the  friends I played with  to cancer and other  games I'd purchase back then  stopped me continuing until now.

[b]Some useful  advice:[/b]

Before you start the game, or at least once you've  met  each of the different types of infected of which there are 13 types you should check out Dr Kessler's Casebook that's available via the Extra's  button,  which details all of the different infected types as well as their strengths and weaknesses.  You can also change the overall game play via the options to make it slighter harder or easier by  adjusting specific attributes such as  removing or adding hints, removing or adding  navigation on the mini map or removing  place markers on the main map and even the infected's health  bars.For those into collecting achievements, there's at least 35 to collect.

cons:  respawn way too fast.  Instead of fighting (and getting paid/loot) i was running much more often.  Larger groups.  No way to turn off the bloom, dust and godrays and glare.  it says they are off in video settings but they are still there.  the only helper tool out there for DI doent do the definitive addition.  

My advice:  dont buy the def addition.  buy the regular addition, you can use the helper tool with it.

The gun play is much better, a huge aspect to that, ammo is more available though out the map, more selection of guns, and a better feeling with them. As well, Hand to hand weapons feel the same with more additions to them. 

The story is lacking with the ending being bad. I feel the characters are unrememberable, but the base system is a neat addition, and map is unique.

Well, I'll break it down. This is basically more of the same as the original DI. The combat, shooting and everything is generally the same. Same weapons, mod types and vehicles. I am a huge fan of both DI and DI:R, but out of the two, I've played this game less than the original, having completed the campaign twice, once on the original and once on the Definitive Edition.

Starting with the good, this game has a far more creepier and unsettling atmosphere than the original. The original has got some jumpscare moments born from sudden attacks by hidden zombies and the infected, but this is far scarier to traverse than the original. There are also some great new mods and weapons, such as the sniper rifles, which are a GODSEND for dealing with the special infected. There's also a new character, John Morgan, a primarily hand-to-hand character and the story picks up right after the ending cutscene of the original game. The old cast is still here in all their glory, as well as new locations and infected to spice it up. There's also a new mode of transport, the boat, which is faster to travel around the jungle but has the added risk of waking all the sleeping drowners in the waterways. Dotted around Henderson and the jungle are various dead zones which act as dungeons filled with walkers and several special infected which makes a nice risk/reward dynamic.

What do I think of the new roster of enemies? Well, they're a mixed bag. We've got all the fan favourites from the previous game, being the walker, infected, thug, butcher, ram, suicider and floater, but we've got some new ones. The least dangerous is the drowner, basically an infected which hides in the water until you come near, when it will suddenly wake up and behave like a normal infected. The next is the grenadier, which is sort of like a reskinned floater. It's a large, slow to turn zombie which hits you from range and is mostly immune to fire damage. Sound familiar? Yep, it's the floater all over again but this time he's got a gas tank on his back which will explode when punctured for an easy kill! We've then got the wrestler, a grotesque monster which a large, swelled up and meaty arm which it will swing and slam into the ground like a club. No real vulnerability other than some slow movement and it's the second most scary and dangerous of the new additions. The final, scariest and downright annoying one is the screamer. Oh my god, the screamer! This thing is like an infected, but when it sees you, it will run up to you at PACE, the same as an infected, before screaming in your face! This will stun you and cause your character to cover their ears, blurring your screen and making you vulnerable, where the screamer will rapidly attack you. Guaranteed dead if this happens to you. This is why snipers are a must when you find these, as a few shots from far away will deal with them but they're TERRIFYING to deal with!

What's bad then, since I'm already being rather negative. Well, for a start, they ramped up the difficulty, which would not be so bad if they didn't chuck EVERYTHING at you in the first area of the game. Remember how it was laid out in Dead Island? You first met walkers and infected when you are very weak and don't have good weapons or stats. Then you meet thugs and suiciders to slowly raise the stakes. You build up and get some skills before meeting rams in Morseby and later on floaters in the sewers. You finally meet the dangerous butchers in the jungle but you've got better weapons and have a chance to deal with them. The first area you're in is the flooded jungle, but instead of just have walkers, infected, drowners and maybe floaters because of all the water, you get everyone! All of the old zombies are right there from the get-go and when you don'y have any mod blueprints, good weapons or perks, this makes the whole thing a drag as you grind up XP for perks and to buy weapons so you actually a chance.

What else? Well, there's the nightmare which is Halai village which has infected spawners. Yes, that's right, infected SPAWNERS. What do I mean by that? Well, normally zombies will respawn after the player has left the area or has been away for a certain amount of time. Here, the infected will constantly spawn on the rooves of certain houses for as long as the player stays in the area. It's not like they're well hidden either, the houses they spawn in are obvious as there's a square hole cut in them where you can literally see the infected climb out of. This makes the whole thing tedious as going anywhere in Halai means you'll constantly be chased by infected and after a point they just become annoying rather than scary.

Overall, do I recommend DI:R? At a push, yes. For a fan of the series like I am, it's a fun time with all the same physics and crazy weapon mods as before and once you're past the flooded jungle portion of the game, it starts being fun as Henderson is beautiful to traverse with no annoying infected spawners and it's more pleasant to look at compared to Moresby. The new weapons and mods are fun and a good addition to the already rather large stockpile from the original DI and the new infected add in a new dynamic of where's safe and where's not. They add a challenge but none of them are too OP or break the experience (although the screamer can go suck on my sniper rifle). It's not as fun as the original and you can probably give it a miss if you weren't drawn in by the original.",1586732217,1587309740,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- It's easy to level up (fast) you can import your save game from dead island 1 too

Cons :
- Shop & Items are sucks! 
i couldn't find stingray tail ANYWHERE! hard to find suicider meat either
so much water bottle, for what?

- Items needed for Electrotheraphy mod are sucks! 
- Mods worse than the original one, old smoky mod is for bladed weapon not for blunt weapon!
- Freezing/lag sometimes
- Team quests are sucks, especially Wayne & Harlow
- Too many ""special infected"", sometimes butcher, suicider, ram (the special from original one) are rare to respawn
- I didn't have ""defeat harlow"" achievement? what happened?
- Survivor skin is ridiculous, no big diference with the original skin
- No DLC story (like ryder white campaign), or combat challenges (like arena)

Ощущение что игру делали 2-3 человека по быстрому, без тестирования и полировки.

А теперь по порядку:

* Мыло продолжает лидировать среди лучших эффектов во всех играх Techland
* Странная производительность с просадками до 40 fps
* Странные булькающие звуки
* FOV уменьшили
* Сломанная механика зомбо-обнимашки
* Перепутанные звуки у зомби
* Зомби могут замахиваться на тебя не нанося урона
* Очень заметная подгрузка текстур, местами они даже не прогружаются, оставаясь мыльными
* Сломанная механика ЕЖ персонажа
* Местами зомби сами испускают дух, даже если их не трогать
* Перебор с освещение
* Сломанная механика инвентаря (пропадают аптечки)
* Странное поведение игры, с пропаданием транспорта если отойти по делам
* Большая вероятность что персонажа придавит дверью машины
* Не всегда получится сбить зараженных (бегающие зомби), ведь при попытке сбить, они забегают на крышу

[bugfix] Зомби кидающий в персонажа нож не убивает его
[bugfix] Нельзя телепортироваться на место водителя стоя у другой двери

Я думаю Techland отлично постаралась в этой игре, чтобы игроки не скучали а были в постоянном напряжении и в постоянном поиске очередных неизведанных глюков и багов.


Excellent high-quality edition of the very buggy game on the new engine from Dying Light

The feeling that the game was made by 2-3 people quickly, without testing and polishing.

And now, in order:

* Soap effects continues to lead among the best effects in all Techland games
* Strange performance with drawdowns up to 40 fps
* Strange gurgling sounds
* FOV reduced
* Broken zombie attack and hug mechanics
* Wrong zombie sounds
* Zombies can swipe at you without causing damage
* Very noticeable texture loading, sometimes they do not even load, remaining soapy
* Broken mechanics with HP character
* Zombies themselves dying without no reason, even if you do not touch them
* Overloaded lighting
* Broken inventory mechanics (first aid kits disappear)
* Strange behavior of the game, with the loss of transport if you go away on business
* It is very likely that the character will hurt by the car door
* It’s not always possible to bring down infected by car (running zombies), because when you try to squash them, they run onto the roof

[bugfix] Zombies throwing a knife at a character does not kill him
[bugfix] You cannot teleport to the driver’s seat while standing at another door

I can understand why some people have the gripes that they do, but nothing in this game detracts from an over all, positive experience. You will encounter an occasional glitch here and there, where a zombie might clip through a wall or part of the landscape, but these are few and far between, and when it does happen, it isn't so dramatic or awful that it takes you out of the experience. Obviously, this game has a huge Dying Light vibe and it's almost what I would refer to as a beta Dying Light, although, it's polished enough that I wouldn't consider it a beta game. Several years ago, when this released, it was more than polished to be a retail release. Now days, I can see why people are a little more critical. Still, this is a fun game and if you like zombie games like Dying Light, this is a no-brainer!

For starters, if you import your character from Dead Island you will lose all of your weapons. I remeber keeping my weapons on the original. Zombies respawn way, way too quickly, so you're constantly being harassed. There are far fewer energy drinks and snack bars, at least on act 1, and that makes the beginning really hard, because you're low on cash and can't really afford to buy medkits and new weapons. By the way, the weapons the game provides you at the start are really weak. I was lvl 39 when I started this game and all the zombies were 41 or higher. So you have less damage, less money, awful damage and far more dangerous zombies. The mini map is always bugged, meaning the path to objectives rarely ever show up, and since the map is confusing, it makes it really hard to move around. Also, when on the boat your friend cannot defend it against those annoying water zombies. If you are driving, your friend is always being attacked and you have to drop from the boat to defend him, since those water zombies pull him off the boat. It's just insane. Having a friend in this game actually makes it harder. I finished the first one in 27 hours, all by myself and by completing all missions. This is worst than the original. Don't buy it if you have the original, unless you want to play with some one, since the original is off the market and you couldn't play multiplayer on it even if your friend also owned the original.",1577845002,1577845002,False,19,4,0.58068084716796875,0,True,False,False

I bought this while it was on sale, i was feeling nostalgic from when i first played the game on console and used the discount coupon you get from the winter sale. Now i would say that i am grateful that i got it for free, but now i really just wish i didn't get this game at all and saved my coupon for something else. It was so much worse from what i had remembered
 
The game is a buggy mess, undead will clip through the wall and floors, sometimes you'll die instantly to doors, cars are extremely hard to drive, and some undead just won't take any damage but instead stay there with all your swings with your weapon going through it. The game's bugs remind me of the initial launch of games such as warframe or more recently borderlands 3 but instead the bugs stayed for the whole life span of the game and so on.

The models in the game were mediocre at best but gave them the benefit of the doubt that it couldn't get any worse and just a side affect from the limited technology we had in 2013 (the same year this game came out). To nobody's surprise it did get worse, models would noclip into buildings, animation when they talked was extremely choppy, and sometimes npcs wouldn't move from a spot no matter what the situation was to the point undead phased through them.

There are so many bugs, problems, and gameplay issues that saying it's mediocre is perfect for the game, it's the definition of borderline mediocre. If you see this game on sale, please don't take the 5$ deal, it's not worth it.",1577515786,1577515786,False,24,4,0.571167647838592529,8,True,True,False

Gotta say though, that I've never really liked Riptide back in 2013, and again in this 2016 version.

The overall navigation is painfully slow.  
Boats & moving over water is such a drag, and far too tedious. Henderson does get better, but I still highly prefer the Slums in the first game.

Too many corners. 
If I'm going to get lost this bad, I'd honestly rather play a real puzzle/labyrinth game

Story isn't as good/not as interesting as the first game, either.

Due to these problems, Riptide gets boring rather quickly and is certainly a ""game"" that I'd really not want to 100%.  I'd gladly 100% the first, though.

Change it too little and it is a rehash and not worth the money. It is a balancing act and one that Dead Island Riptide does a good job at. I had played the original Riptide back on Windows but not much since it would crash often in the first ten minutes. I didn’t have any of those issues with the Linux version of the Definitive Edition thankfully. 

	Once again you can pick from the 4 different characters to play as. You can import your save file from the original dead Island Definitive Edition if you kept it. The story continues from the first as your group is still trying to escape the zombie outbreak. Without going into too much of a spoiler you get stuck on a different island. This allows the developers to reuse a lot of assets and can be seen as a tad lazy but overall the story was decently executed. It adds several new secondary characters for you to interact with. They all are very similar as the original as they just serve as basic quest givers and don’t go into a deep backstory. The game adds a new mode of travel in the form of a boat. It is fun to use since you can use the engine blade to hack up zombies. It is also optional so if you prefer to walk or drive to places you still can.  The weapons and skills are very much the same as the original which is familiar if not a bit too much so. You can also traverse the landscape by climbing rocks and vines which while is a nice addition, it also is usually required to get to certain places instead of being an optional way to get to a location in multiple ways. Combat is still very satisfying as before and playing solo was still very doable.

	There were still some issues that never got fixed from the original such as enemies being able to one hit kill me by throwing knives at me even though they are very low end weapons and I was at full health. I also encountered a glitch where I had to click on a boat to install the motor but the boat wasn’t clickable. I had to reload the game and it was then clickable and I could progress. In another part of the game I crouched to enter a hallway that had rubble so I could search a container for loot but I was then unable to get out as I was too tall to do so even when crouched. Once again I had to reload to before I entered the hallway. Sometimes bodies would flicker for a second or two but never for longer and only a handful of times in my playthrough. One other isuse was there was no option to remap the key you use to throw a flare and that happens to be the button I use to kick. While I could choose another button to kick let’s just say I wasted a great many flares as old habits die hard. A few times a sound effect was missing. Such as when I hit or shoot a zombie no sound would play. Once again this only happened a couple times through my playthrough.

	I played Dead Island Definitive Edition on Linux. Like the original Definitive Edition it suffered from an issue where the game would crash before loading the main menu. Like the original this was caused by a file called “LibGL.so”. The game was made to only work with a specific version of that file. As you can imagine over the years updated versions of have been made. The game will crash with anything newer than that version and no distro I tried uses one that old. The file is also not included with the game, it uses whichever version your OS has installed. I had to download a copy of the correct version file and drop it into the game folder. Once I did this the game launched just fine. The performance was great as well. I ran the game maxed out at 1080P and my FPS was usually 80-100 or higher. It supported framerates above 60 which was fantastic. There was no manual saving but the game auto saves after every completed task so it isn’t terrible although I would prefer manual save. There was support for Vsync, one AA setting, one ambient occlusion setting, as well as 7 other settings to tweak.  Alt-Tab worked just fine. The game did not crash at all during play. My CPU usage during gameplay was usually around 39%, my system RAM usage was usually around 5.3GB. The game took up 9.45 GB of storage and uses Techland’s own engine called Chrome Engine 5. I played version 1.1.2 of the game.

	I paid $3.30 CAD for Dead Island Definitive Edition. I can say that for how much fun it was it is easily worth $50 CAD. If you enjoy action games, co-op games, zombie games, give it a try if you haven’t already.  It adds to the Dead Island story well and while not innovating a ton it is still a great game at it’s core. It has some bugs and issues but none overshadow the fun I had. I finished a solo playthrough in just under 19 hours.

Dead Island Riptide is a complete game in itself, rather than being an expansion or dlc of the first game. The story is pretty good, the graphics are excellent, sound and voice-acting all great, lots of collectibles to find, lots of quests. There are a few new additions to the game, like different zombie enemies and attack moves but everything is pretty much exactly the same as the first game. A playthrough took me about 30 hours.

A few negatives - like the first game there are lots of bugs and glitches in the sound, graphics, enemy AI etc. Nothing that ruins the game but its something that should have been fixed. It also has a really bad ending, just a total mess of an end mission that feels thrown together at the last minute.

But overall, great zombie-killing fun, a gorgeous looking open-world to explore and a worthy sequel to Dead Island. If you liked the first game, you'll like this.

Freshly starting the game, melee weapons are very lack-luster and feel almost useless, up until you get your first gun and then the game becomes very trivial.. especially to the point where you find the sniper rifle. But the sniper rifle is one of the reasons I fell in love with this game in the first place.. ironic isn't it?

The game carries progress from your past game but if it fails to detect your old saves (which happened to me since I played the original Dead Island game instead of the DE version), they would just give you X amounts of points and you assign however you want.

The game's mechanics and system is pretty much the same as the first Dead Island and they just added a new character to play as. If you enjoyed the first game's systems, then you should be fine but if you expected more, then you will probably be disappointed.

The story is kind of okay since it isn't as lengthy as the first game. The goal in this game is pretty much the same as the first game, ""GET OFF THE F***IN ISLAND!!!!!"" Additionally most characters return in this game but sadly, they never got to push the plot further with some of the other old characters [spoiler] but instead waste a bit of time making us learn new characters that either dies or just not heard from again later.[/spoiler] The only good story parts are when you find the audio logs since the voice acting is very convincing and it can make you feel for those guys.

The world/levels of the game is alright. There are like 2 large portions of the map in the game unlike the first one being like 3 or 4. There are some bugs like colliding with plant life and some of the levels don't explain why you have only 1 way to access a location. The game also acts like a MMO where players can go raid a small area (Dead Zones) to gain some good loot and the Dead Zone levels are mostly repetitive though.

Lastly, the multiplayer. I didn't play with friends at all and I only played it once with a random stranger which ended up making the experience bitter since the player didn't help me in the defending the fort section. I would recommend multiplayer though since you can create crazy and funny experiences in this game with friends and some zombies are tough to fight alone.

1. An actual start over instead of starting at level 15 with be nice.

I know you can just do custom instead, so as far as presets go it doesn't really matter, but immediately having 14 points is ridiculous, instead, you could have 14 more levels to gain to get the fun out of getting more points to spend ! 

It's almost like when you use something like cheat engine (Basically just cheating/hacking) for other games, it eventually takes all the the fun out of it, as does starting at level 15 for me, this may not be a huge issue but like it does for me, and possibly other people, it takes a big part of the fun out of it, and frankly, starting any level higher than 1 seems kind of pointless to have unless it's paid for or some other logical reason. (Not an extremely needed change to the game but it's just my suggestion anyway)

2. Aiming was actually a lot different that I expected, now this could just be a major problem from going console to pc, or maybe the devs just have to work on their aiming system for pc players, just doesn't feel as smooth and doesn't seem like they put a lot of effort into making it user-friendly as it should be.

Let's think about this, you could have an entirely PERFECT game on everything besides aiming, and for fps type of games that can ruin the ENTIRE game and makes the rest of the effort put into it seem pointless, now unless you only play games for the story, not really the gameplay, this will affect just like any other game with this sort of issue in a hugely negative way. Whether taking some of the fun out of it or a consistent annoyance, I think it's something to be improved upon. (Should probably be fixed/change or whatever you devs can do to help fix it would be nice !)

Kind of like when Rage 2 came out (And I know it's kind of a unpopular opinion) I was extremly surprised and what happened with their aiming system, and lost the consistent fun spark that I got from Rage. I've had Rage on console and PC for a long time and I found that on both of them their aiming system worked out super well, I don't know what's happened with them, I've tried getting a new mouse if it was that and my NVIDIA settings, and I still seem to come to the conclusion of that like Rage 2, was a waste of money. Rage is one of my favorite games today, like Dead Island, maybe I was just looking for the same games but different story, maybe some new items as well, but overall it is a possibility it could just be I got too used to the games, and their aiming.

Was gonna add a third thing but I figured I've complained enough by now, lol.

Even though it sounds like I've been saying this game is a massive disappointment, don't get me wrong on a few things, I love the story of these games, I love absolutely EVERYTHING else about their games ! Dead Island 1 and Dead Island Riptide, but Dead Island 1 has been the best gaming experience of my life ! So props to the devs for Dead Island 1, I prefer ending on good notes so there you go :3 !

This game did not age well. I remember having fond memories of playing it; which is why I bought it. But after the first thirty minutes, it felt like a deadbeat and dull experience. The story line is D-tier at best, and I'm being generous. It's such a painstakingly vague yet simple backstory, it's like it's trying to reel in it's viewer with it's ""mysterious"" plot line and reveals. The story is filled with so much cliche's, it's not even ironically endearing. It's just boring. 

What I think really takes the cake, is the fact that the game play mechanics don't even make up for the story. When you kill a Walker or finish off a Thug, it doesn't give you any satisfaction or sense of accomplishment. The event that ends up being the most enjoyable is the Prologue, which temporarily allows you to mow down a horde of walkers with a rifle; and even that only felt.. approximately okay. 

The leveling and upgrade system works very simply, and the upgrades don't get any more interesting than *maybe* a new ability, or just a slight damage/handling upgrade to something that already coexisted in your inventory. 

The walkers/thugs' attack patterns are extremely easy to follow, but they take such a long time to kill. It's not hard to lose your patience after taking five minutes to kill three zombies. The A.I also act like idiots and deal no damage, so you have to be the piggy-back hero for all of them; which is meticulous and boring. 

Replaying Dead Island: Riptide on PC has affirmed my decision about this game. It's an extremely underwhelming experience, and I'm ashamed that I blew twenty-bucks to experience nothing but immense disappointment. I didn't even get a good sense of nostalgia from playing it.

Story:

Taking place immediately after the events of the first game, as the survivors are trying to get away from the zombie infested island of Banoi. After the helicopter they used to escape with is put down on a military ship they soon find the ship overrun with zombies and get shipwrecked on a new island of Palanai which is as well infested with Zombies. So you have to find a way of this island before the military will nuke it.

The story in Dead Island Riptide is terrible. Which is no surprise considering how bad the story was in the first Dead Island game was. Many characters do things that endanger other peoples lives and a lot of the plot feels very samey as you get stuck on an island and have to escape. It honestly feels like the script just swapped certain characters with new ones.

Graphics:

The graphics like Dead Island Definitive Edition are good, but only for environments as the NPC character models are absolutely awful looking like they are already dead and got up from their graves. The environments however are great and looks rather impressive. A lot of the island is absolutely beautiful and it's fun to explore the island and see the sights 

Audio:

The voice acting is absolutely horrendous, pretty much everyone does a terrible job. A lot of the characters put on these really fake accents and they are really off putting. The funniest one is the new character named Logan who has one of the worst Australian accents I've ever heard.  The audio also has the same glitches featured in the first definitive edition so when you get a critical strike it echoes so loudly it will make you go deaf.

Gameplay:

The gameplay in Dead Island games is both fun and frustrating. The game like the previous one is focused mainly on melee combat, with some firepower sprinkled throughout, but just like the first game the guns are absolutely worthless and not even worth bothering with unless you want to use them to fight raiders as they do basically nothing on the zombie enemies.

The melee combat is fun the stamina bar is what kills it entirely for me. It seems like two swings from any weapon will deplete your stamina which makes the combat rather frustrating. While it's fun to hack and slash enemies to bits, but sadly it gets incredibly boring rather fast, not to mention the game is rather long. My first playthrough took me 14 hours to complete every quest and second time completing everything took me 10. 

Verdict:

Dead Island Riptide Definitive Edition is not that great of a remaster and overall the game is really bland and not really worth playing. If you really want to play this then you can do way worse, but for other people, just get Dying Light, it's better in every way, shape and form. 

Final Rating:
5/10

Pros:
+ Hacking and Slashing zombies is fun 
+ Environments are great 

Cons:
- Frustrating gameplay
- Remaster is not that different from the original game

-Good graphics for release time, also currently
-Good optimization, always a good thing
-Various characters to choose from
-Two decently large areas filled with plenty of vegetation, zombies, etc. Also, a small transitional area.
-A good selection of weapons, upgrades, crafts
-Overall fun after fully upgrading and running around bashing every zombies brain in possible in many gruesome ways
-A decent variety of monsters considering the capabilities
-Coop was always fun

CONS:
-Sort of stupid plot and not as good as original 
-While there are many people, the character development is just shit
-Coop is pretty much dead
-Driving mechanics suck
-Having a barrel or 3 foot fence be the ultimate decider of rather you live or die because you can’t jump over obviously jump overable objects is just infuriating
-Again, character development...

Overall, I liked Dead Island Riptide, it is in many ways better than the original, that is except for the horrendous characters and half-way thought out plot. It was also a beginning phase to something much greater, Dying Light. You can call this Dying Light Beta.

This game makes it hard to have fun with, because it has a lot of bugs and glitches that have a negative impact on enjoyment. It's very obvious that this game was rushed out of development and hasn't seen much support. It makes this game stink of money grab intentions. This one is rather shameful in comparison to the original Dead Island.

Some combat moves were added that might've been neat on paper but were glitched to hell to the point of being almost useless. You can do a jump attack from above, which is an instant kill to normal zombies, but doing so runs the risk of being stuck in the attack animation. For a few seconds your character is floating slightly above the ground, you can't move, and you are vulnerable to attacks while it's happening. Most of the time, it's not a good idea to use this move.

Another very strange bug prevents Fury from working when it is assigned to a mouse button. I used to have it assigned to the middle mouse button in the original Dead Island, and that worked well. Can’t do it in Riptide for whatever dumb reason.  Actually, Fury is very spotty if you are importing a character. Most of the time the Rage meter just doesn't fill to max, so you can't even use Fury. On rare occasions it actually fills and Fury becomes available. Another bug that you’d think would be fixed in a patch.

A lot of new explosives put in this game, making a lot of variety if secondary weapons. Most of them are good and you can use some good combos with them. One example is using poison bombs to poison the zombies, putting them in a toxic state, which makes them extremely vulnerable to fire damage. You can follow that up with a Molotov, and it's pretty much an instant kill to any enemy. This is a great strategy for tough specials or bosses (though, vast majority of bosses are toxic already, making them incredibly trivial encounters). On the other hand, new to the game are mines, which are great... when they aren't falling under the map when you place them (this happens a lot).

Some of the quest flow is flawed and you may find yourself missing out of quests and their rewards due to it. Such as Harlow’s team quests where you won’t find the items needed for one of those quests until after the quest fails and can’t be completed. A couple of continuous quests are placed in a very out of the way place in the map, making it tedious and undesirable to do it. One of these quests are actually near a fast travel point, but since the devs seemed to have forgotten to add the location to the list of fact travel points, that fast travel point is a one way trip and you have to manually get back to that location. Seems like a silly oversight that shouldn’t have happened, or at the very least been fixed in a patch. On the other hand, now quest rewards scale with level, meaning that continuous quests are a lot more profitable and make leveling up incredibly fast. There's a quest where you won't find the item anywhere in the game except for a single place on the map, and you need three of those things. There are items in the game that have absolutely no use at all (some that are gotten from the more difficult areas in the game).

There’s balance issues in this game that show the lack of testing done with it. A new zombie special called the Screamer is a very annoying addition, particularly if you’re playing solo. They have the ability to make a high pitched scream that stuns your character, making him unable to attack and move very slowly, and it calls every zombie in the area to that location. That’s pretty lethal for a solo player, and seems obvious that it was meant for team play. There is another special that has attacks specifically for a group of players in mind, so not a lot of thought was put in for solo play. Then there is the case that just about all the bosses are in a toxic state, making them extremely easy if you have a fire weapon mod on a weapon. Then you’ll likely have to deal with glitches that allow walkers to one shot a full health bar character with a thrown weapon (died more times to this than anything else). Some weapon drops are so rare that you may not see a single one in a play through. Then you have new additions, like the staff, that are so overpowered that you can essentially finish the complete game with that one weapon. You’ll eventually come across weapon mods very late in the game that are completely obsolete by the time you get them. When walkers with weapons scare you much more than a boss does, you know the game isn’t balanced very well. It creates an experience that is either very annoying or very boring.

Forget weapon farming in this game. Chest respawns are inconsistent and borked and merchants sale the same thing throughout the game with little variation. It makes loot in the game rather dull. Then there were a lot of odd changes to weapons and especially weapon mods that makes you wonder what they were thinking when they designed and balanced weapons. Some of the changes are nice and allow for more modding options. Then others, like the Tesla mod, were nerfed to hell and back. In a game that is supposed to depend a lot on leveling and looting, it seems rather absurd that looting seems like such an oversight in this game.

Also, physics in this game sucks, which makes impact mods rather dull.

There are many more bugs and glitches that make this game a joke and unrecommendable. 

The game also has, perhaps, a fourth of the content that the original game has. This is pretty much an expansion to the original game. Or rather, it plays like act 5 of the original game, starting exactly where the original ends. Yet it is selling for the same price as the original as if it were a fully fledged sequel. I've seen people mistakenly refer to this as ""Dead Island 2"". The asking price is ridiculous because of that.

Combat however is still a lot of fun, with intense gore and hits that feel like they connect properly.

Gameplay-wise, all you do is kill zombies and do fetch quests, and now and then fight an overpowered boss. Death just means respawning  and losing a bit of cash, but you'll collect so much of it over the course of the game you'll barely notice it. This makes it feel a bit of a pointless mechanic.

Riptide was a stand-alone expansion to Dead Island back in 2013. Releasing such content was already a rarity at that time; you usually make do with DLCs where your best bet is to purchase the corresponding Season Pass instead of individual contents. So, releasing an expansion to an already well-known game seems a pretty cool idea. The story takes place immediately after Dead Island - from Banoi we switch to Palanai, another tourist resort-like location which is taken over by our undead friends. 

[b]Anything new?[/b]

Yes and no. Yes, as there are some new things in terms of game mechanics but no as they do not significantly alter the gameplay experience. Again, this is an expansion pack so do not expect a completely overhauled and reworked system.  A new addition to the group is John, a 5th member, who is mainly specialised in using brass knuckles. This was the only weapon type left out - we finally have a hero who's expert at hand-to-hand combat.

Another thing is the introduction of survival sections. As our heroes move from one place to another every time just before they begin their journey we are to make a stand. The top of the screen indicates the strength of the horde - naturally, this is decreasing slowly as the zombies are attacking in waves. We can lay traps and put up fences at the beginning and between waves. Using gatling guns to riddle the living dead with bullets is pure fun in these sections.

We also have some new zombie types such as the drowner that quickly wakes up (he is floating on the water appearing to be dead) and attacks you. He is not much of a threat but if you do not pay attention you are in for a nasty surprise. Drowners mean a lot of water - prepare to use not just automobiles but also a motorboat to explore the new island's remote locations. My favourite was the screamer - an old lady whose brain is visible and who is able to emit such a loud scream that your hero starts wandering about while trying to endure the loud noise. There are also some bungalow and apartment areas that are full of zombies and they include bosses - expect a difficult fight but usually great reward at the end.

[b]Why is it Definitive?[/b]

Because it was re-released a couple of years later along with its predecessor. The ""normal"" versions are not available anymore just the remastered editions. Basically, the game was redone with the use of a later Chrome Engine (the same that ran under Dying Light). It is a nice touch as the game looks much, much better (especially the shadows and some of the lights) but then again you have the same gameplay and some of the annoying bugs or glitches remained.

[b]Who is this game for?[/b]

It is for zombie game fans. Techland's real big hit was definitely Dying Light with its parkour mechanics but if you want to see where the zombie fest started for them feel free to purchase Dead Island and its expansion.

 1. There is almost nothing new here asides from a new story and have the same characters and almost the same weapons. 

2. The whole experience as an adventure just doesn't feel compelling and addicting somehow. It's like your backpacking through Europe and you just get tired of doing so after a period of time and decide to stop and rest.

3. The controls and the mechanics are so excruciating and painful that I felt like I was gonna just pass out from exhaustion from trying to get used to them.

4. This is just my opinion really, but the AI are just too OP and getting from place to place feels like more of a chore than a challenge.

So do yourself a favor. Buy Dying Light instead. It may cost you more but It plays almost exactly like Dead Island with only some minor changes to some parts of the mechanics, some new weapons, a new setting as well as a new and more compelling storyline. Plus some parkour. And you rely on alot of that to get anywhere in the game compared to Riptide where your so confused on where to go and struggle to get there.
And I understand people will like different things when it comes to games and if you still want to get Riptide even after reading this. Then by all means go ahead, And just as a friendly reminder, I'm not trying to stop you from buying this, I'm just sharing my opinion.",1520053043,1520053043,False,4,0,0.485718905925750732,7,True,False,False

On the level of zombie killing on a small sandbox map, it's fine.  It just felt like a game that had everything it needed to say or do in the first one.

Problems:
- NPC comments alone are enough to consider quitting.  You know on hold queues that chime in every 30sec and say ""your call is important to us...""?  That are your NPCs.  ""Are you still here,"" every time you walk by them, and the pill junkie who will moan, ""Bring me more,"" if you get within 50' on repeat.
- Frankly, most people in this game compalaining of illness all sounded dopesick to me.
- The clipping is off the hook.  The guy who is your storage container vibrated himself into the floor like he was trying to escape Gorilla Grodd.  When I would back into zomibes with a car, most ended up stuck in it like I was driving the 2008 Kitty Pryde.  I once fought a puple level boss by putting mines on either side of the wall he was standing next to.  When an explosion went off, he would pass thought the wall, hit the next mine, repeat.
- The faces of the people save across the island.  My god.  Was this the closest island to Bikini Atoll?  They all had looks like the island was cused with zombies and horizontal hold issues.
- The swords woman...you're sticking with that skirt and thigh-highs?  That necktie is like an zombie surival OSHA violation.  Not that the rapper guy's outfit isn't making me lose weight just imaging how swamp-ass hot he must be.
- Avoid the drop attack at all cost.  Not only may it be for nothing, but you'll spend about five painful seconds unable to move, like you just stuck the landing and you're waiting for the judges score, as every zombie in 30' beat you like a pinata.
- Rejoice as every drunkenly lobbed projecticle by a probably unseen zomb is a one-hit kill.
- We're still doing the slowly discharging flashlight?  Did it come with the 1998 Trope DLC?
- You know what?  Good voice acting, though.
- There's no persistent state to the whole game.  Screw doing cave/house missions.  Arrived by boat?  Better LoJack that, because you're swimming home when you get out.  You could make yourself rich just walking more than 100' from any pile of luggage, because you can reloot it when you get back.  I sold the same machete stuck in the bad 100x.  It's like Dead Island: Amnesia Island.  Well, except for haunted house staging.  Warp to the marina location....cue the scream...cue the running zombie guy with the blond afro and Nikki Sixx eye shadow.

You can still boomerang your knives (which is still the best part). Maybe I was rusty, but this game seemed a lot harder than the first one, which is a plus.

I'm not going to say much because this game is exactly like the first one. There are no improvements made. So...if you liked the first one, you will like this. If you think the first one sucked, this one will suck. You are pretty much paying for maps.

Dead Island: Riptide Definitive Edition is equal to an incomplete game. Don't get me wrong, it has a complete story to it, and it is playable, it's just the constant bugs throughout the game.

When you throw your weapon at an infected, it comes up with a hit marker showing you that you will hit the infected, however, at times when you throw your weapon it will miss completely and go straight past the infected.

The lighting is way to dark, it's as though it's night time despite the sun being bright and shiny. Oh look, a paradox!

Flashlight appears to run out faster than the other Dead Islands, the infected are somewhat far too strong, and the weapons deal almost no damage.

Other than this it's a good game. But y'know, stick with Dead Island: Riptide, as this Dead Island, although being a remake, is just too buggy and feels incomplete.

Also it includes every DLC of the game such as new weapons, new ''skins'' for your character and many more.
The game takes place in some new locations which they were hit by the zombie apocalipse and it continues the events of the previous Dead Island title. The characters who are playable are the same with their unique skill tree and fury but this time a new ''guy'' joins the crew who is almost the God in the game cause he is really difficult to be killed either by zombies or by accidents.

If you like games which has a lot of gore, blood and some sadistic animations and textures, i recommend buying it. The only negative comment in my opinion is that the multiplayer is kinda dead ... not entirely but kinda and if you decide to play with your fellas then they must have the Definitive Edition as well.

1: Bugs on top of bugs. Many from the first game that are still not fixed and some even worse than before. Accuracy is still very very bad and sometimes enemies won't even take damage even when you aimed properly or you'll miss point blank shots. Sometimes your weapons will disappear if you throw them as well. The pathing system is also bugged so you'll have to look at the map to see where you are supposed to be going and hope that you are going in the right direction.

2: Scaling is non-existent. Even if you basically use the new game plus option you are not starting out with a fully upgraded weapon but they treat you like you are and you just die. It got to the point where I stopped fighting the zombies and just ran through them instead unless I had to.

3: Zombies still don't stumble and still cheatand follow through with their animations. This should be an easy fix. If a zombie loses more than 50% of its hp in an attack it should not be able to continue the action. This makes fighting groups of zombies extremely difficult.

4: In new game plus everything is ridiculously expensive. I don't mean to repeat myself but you aren't starting with a wad of cash and your best weapons. You pretty much cannot do anything besides helplessly run and hope that you don't die. There really needs to be a difficulty setting for the game.


Basically to sum this up, if you are a new player then get the first installment of the series and play that instead. THEN decide if you want to spend money on an unrefined game that is basically a continuation of the story.

Edited: I also forgot to mention that zombies with throwing knives can and will one shot you with 0 fucks given. Buy at your own risk because this game is definitely not polished at all.",1503007737,1503007989,False,8,2,0.417443424463272095,1,True,False,False

Actually i know diff playing non definitive edition with older then upgraded card,then definitve edition with AMD RX  480  ,and its really worth it! 

Game now with definitive edition works native on Linux and Steam OS, and linux users now have opportunity to play second part on linux powered machine..,
So i  vote positive  with wallet for that..
And only i wish this happend earlier,
but beter ever then never,and this time ,this definitive version works smooth,and even better graphical experience..

Get it even  if you played Dead Island-Riptide non definitive edition  before..as this time graphics will not let you down..

Version 1.1.2 works very smoth and graphic quality can be set to very high...(depends what your card can)

This is definitive choice ,as this is definitive edition!

Game is long ,full of side missions,even more mission which you may or may not discovered to complete,as most side missions open another mission,try to get all achivements if you can..then you will realise that isi really long game!
Much more better then Tomb Rider,in controling character with mouse and keyboard,much better graphics,and story!
Remember Dead Island was game of the year ,too..and for consoles this game instead of riptide,have name dead island 2 with so much less graphics to enjoy..Consoles still  can not even get definitive edition,as even non definitive edition on consoles was low in graphics compared to PC dedicated vwersion,and yes this is not console port! ..Its made for PC!

The only way that I can accomplish that (actually changing weapons) in inventory mode is to unequip the current item or unequip my intended item then equipping the item I want to use.

Also, the inventory issue in single player mode is livable, but in multi-player mode the game CANNOT BE PAUSED - so in combat you can't change weapons without risking death UNLESS you throw your current weapon (which may empty the slot) and some other weapon pops into the slot.
    The Definitive version should not have been released and even if it were free the price is too steep because of the inconvenience in multiplayer. Video - The shadows are blacker when you stand in the sun and the game seems a bit jerky at times - driving a vehicle isn't as much fun for some reason. Other than a little improvement to the video there are NO POSITIVE additions to the game and, of course, the older/better version is no longer available. Oh yes, they renamed some of the descriptions to include 'worn' and other adjectives, but this game is truly worn in its own right.
    DECIDE to return it BEFORE 14 days pass or you MUST PLAY less than 2 hours for a refund. STEAM only refunds based on that criteria - no person involved at their end.

Negatives:-
-The stamina bar punishes you so hard that when there is more than 3 zombies around you cant do anything.
-Feels like you are meant to play multiplayer to counter some of the special monster and hordes of zombies.
-The whole game feels clunky(except the driving which is actually well made).
-Due to the stamina bar which you run out of after 4 hits with a mace, I felt constent stress and it wasn't enjoyable. This lead to me just running past everything which isn't fun.
-Please give me the option to get rid of head bobble
-There was a black guy called Harold(I think) who asked for painkillers, he sounded like Harry Potter(this was funny)
-I found myself constently getting stuck in crevasse where I couldn't escape
-The mission feel pointless and make me wonder. *bit of a spoiler, [spoiler] Why can't they just all work together and lift the boat from the swamp area to the ocean?! [/spoiler]
-The minimap didn't show the actually map, it was just bare with the quest marker on, which lead to me having to constently open the map.
-The QTE are always the same, LBM then RMB or E.
-Don't understand why there isn't a block in this game when fighting.
-Some of the animation like the jump on the zombies below you, I didn't understand what the character was doing, and you would be punished more do it as you would be standing still for like 3 seconds while zombies just hit you.
-Killing the special zombies ""thugs"" is literally just running around in a circle for 5 minutes hitting them.
-Feels like the zombies are super strong in this game, I kept getting on like 10% from 1 zombie combo
-Just feels more stressful than fun.

Positives:-
-Looks nice
-Ran fine
-The ragdoll on the zombies are good when you are fighting them
-Key re-binding is super nice

I was hoping to have fun like I used to on the original Dead Island but instead found it super stressful and would rather play something else. It may be fun with friends but the awkward movement and animations just make it super boring and not engaging.

Sadly though, this one is highly buggy and not worth playing in my opinion. The introduction of ""camps"" where you can board up the walls and try to control the hordes that attack was an interesting idea but I don't feel it was implemented properly.

Moreover, there is some kind of strange bug where normal zombies are insanely powerful compared to how they used to be. This makes for an extremely tedious battle EVERY time you encounter one and god forbid you encounter more than one at a  time which is all the dang time.

Also, the flashlight button caused the player character to throw out a flare at the same time so you constantly had extremely bright flares all over the place when you turned your flashlight on or off.

I just couldn't look past the weird bugs present in this game and highly recommend you skip over this expansion. If you want more Dead Island action then just replay Dead Island rather than getting this.",1499026473,1499026473,False,8,0,0.555333852767944336,0,True,False,False

Pros:

- Game is more fun than the negative reviews lead you to believe. By contrast, it doesn't have the maturity that Dying Light has, however; there are features that I see here that ended up in dying light. (even some of the map icons)

- The game strongly promotes multiplayer, and unlike the first one; there is an emphasis on multiplayer cooperation. In early stages of the game, you are pretty subceptible to death after just a few blows. However, it gets better as your character levels.

- Weapon feel and the skill tree are nice. some of the skill tree items feel not needed, but otherwise it's beneficial.

Neutral: 

- Game has updated engine features, but the same old textures and wire frames. It is dressed more nicely, but technicially not fully modernized.

- Game as others have said is VERY bright and somewhat distracting. There is a sheen to everything in the game; and in dark places, this effect is actually nice and pops the environment more.

- Car handling is ok, the car can be used as a weapon; and due to this I find it to be the most overpowered weapon in the game.

Cons: 

- Zombies literally come at you from nowhere. Not a con for some, but I dislike strongly games that randomly spawn an enemy right next to you just because.

- Melee combat can vary from a side slash to a chopping motion. For some reason, there are so many times I could count that you miss due to the incorrect motion being used for the attack... Conveniently, this depending on your stamina will leave you a sitting duck to be knocked down.

- Lack of cohesion with the story... The story is awful. The showcase to this game is its mechanics. Dying Light blows away the storytelling aspect of the game 10000 fold. The characters are annoying and senselessly vitriolic. You can play the entire game and feel absolutlely no attachment to any of the primary characters or the NPC's. Again, this leads to my ""rushed"" argument.

Overall:

It is CHEAP right now on the steam store. I would not have bought this otherwise. In a weird way, I am glad I did. You may feel the same way if you played through techland's other gems and want to complete the series. This game isn't terrible.

Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide are fine games... BUT only ONCE.
After that, it just get extremely boring, heck, its get boring before the end of the game.
It may be an open world game, but it feels like it's linear as heck.
This is supposed to be a definitive edition of the game, but it is just the same unoptimized piece of crap with a few ""instagram"" filters, and those ""filters"" are horrible, it's just plain unrealistic.
I have unfortunately pre-purchased Escape Dead Island hoping it would be good, and to get access to the beta of Dead Island 2, even if we should not pay to play a beta, it should be them who should pay us to play the beta and let them know about the bug and stuff.
But why did I wanted Dead Island 2 in the first place? Did I think it would be any good? Why would it be better?
Hopefully it will, I am not one against good games, of course not! But this series is literally sh**.
It gets repetitive pretty quick, it's a buggy mess, monkeys could probably optimize games better than this.

Luckily for me, I got the definitive editions for ""free"".
Not really since I have bought the Dead Island games and Escape Dead Island for a total of approx. 65$.
Those games are worth 9.99$ max, Escape Dead Island was worth 4.99$ max at its release, I have bought that crap for what? 50$? Hell yes i do feel cheated.
Luckily for us, no one is forcing us to buy their games.
I have pre-ordered Dying Light too back then, the full edition for approx. 110$ It sure is a good game BUT it is not worth that price either, better than Dead Island, yes, but it still is not enough.
So I'll never be buying any games from them anymore, except if it is really but really cheap.
And you should not either, not an order, just a friendly tip.

If you have already played Dead Island Riptide, do not buy this.
If it would be your first time, you could always try it but do not spend more than 3$ for this crap.

7.5/10 the first time you play Dead Island.
6.5/10 the first time you play Dead Island Riptide.

+) BGM is better than Dead Island but since it's remastered this shouldn't get credit for that. I just like the back ground music in the dead zones. They were very thrilling.
+) XP table is optimized. I think it's set to New Game + xp from the beginning. I love this part.

-) A hand mark should be given when the player is near the subject. There was one quest that didn't and it looked like it wasn't among them. What the heck?
-) Range of Hand to hand weapons or structure of zombies seriously needs to be fixed. I am swinging my fists in front of these giant zombies and all I hear is ""Huuuuiiiarrgh!"" For example, if I swing 10 times. 4 or 5 just hits the air.
-) You can't hit a zombie when you're above it. All you hear is ""Huuuuuiiiiarrgh!"" again! The zombie just does his roaring thing and doesn't even get scratched! At all! This may only be true to fists though.
-) Why can't we change the key for 'Jumping down to zombies'? Which is 'E' by the way. I changed my 'USE' key to E so I had to die for like 3 times during the play for just trying to loot a dead zombie. Instead of taking the money, my Jon jumps way down there to the zombie to hit it from the above which of course resulted in fancy suicide.

[i] Sadly, Dead Island Definitive Edition made me hate zombie games so much that I do not want to purchase the continuation of the story which is Dead Island Riptide because I know for sure that it will be the same as this game. Ignore this game completely... [/i] boy was I stupid enough to buy Dead Island Riptide

Dead Island Riptide is a zombie game developed by Techland and published by Deep Silver, it sort of takes place after the events of Dead Island and continues right after the ending of the first game. Dead Island takes place on Banoi, a party island where people get drunk and turn into zombies, you play one of the four characters in the game and you have to try and survive four acts of zombies and escape the island

Honestly, I do not know why Deep Silver ordered Techland to make a 'definitive edition' because I saw very few improvements but mostly a lot of things were taken out of the game

Dead Island Riptide's gameplay is mostly focused on melee action hence why the gunplay is the worse gunplay I've seen in a game also the driving is the worst I've seen. The only okay thing is the melee action where you bash zombies' brains and bodies

The story and characterization is also really bad. The story was really boring and I couldn't care less about the characters in the game, when there were some 'upsetting' moments I could not shed a tear because the characterisation was terrible also voice acting is bad, many characters trying their best to do Australian and Jamaican accents but fail horribly

This game's optimization is also terrible, for a game that came out so many years ago the 'definitive editon' plays horribly and it took me 20 to 25 minutes to optimize the game to make it at least playable

Sadly, Dead Island Riptide Definitive Edition is just as bad as Dead Island Definitive Edition and Techland and Deep Silver didn't even bother on making it a better version then what it's original was, I'd only recommend the original Dead Island/Dead Island Riptide if you feel like playing a zombie game, otherwise, steer clear away from the Dead Island series and its 'definitive editions'

It ran like garbage even on my powerful system, constant stuttering and fps drops due to poor coding. Now the game runs like a dream (i7 3.6gz, 16gb ram, gtx 970) and I can play through it again much more comfortably since they fixed its performance with this release. The regular Dead Island Definitive Edition also fixed the same god awful stutter problem the original game had so get that along with this.

I don't see any glitches so far besides what were in the original game. Yea they should've been fixed in this version because they were stupid glitches but oh well. The game is certainly totally playable and beatable despite them. It's not known for crashing so as pc gamers we can at least be thankful for that considering how suck balls awful a ton of releases in 2016 were.

If you liked DI1 you should like this because it's the same game, new environment. Plus the load times are instant now when in the regular version they were insanely long. Pretty amazing.

And everything being covered in water makes exploration even more annoying. The other very irritating feature are respawning zombies. It's no fun to clear a whole location of enemies just to enter/leave a building and end up being surrounded by them again.

But I still was able to finish it, which means it's not so bad. It's just as fun to try different characters/builds and finding better loot as it was before. It's probably even more fun with friends (too bad I don't have any). If you never played Dead Island, play the first one instead, and if you like it, you can try this.

If you have a thing for zombies, these and Dying Light are the best games to play. The Definitive versions do look better, with more realistic colouring and lighting, although it gets so contrasty at times it is hard to see.

These editions seem to have fewer zombies in many areas and are much easier to play. There's a leaping attack feature that seems to be new and it catches you out by flinging you off of buildings and platforms when you least expect it.

The voice acting is dreadful and the script pretty bad. The woman leaving diary notes is the only person who appears to have had any acting experience at all. It all shows just how much better Techland got at this when they made Dying Light.

For those who haven't played DIR before, or those who want to play it again, I would definitely recommend you buy this. However, if you have already played through it a few times, there's probably no point in getting it. 

Pros:
Entertaining Hack'n'Slash combat
Delicious Gore
Beautiful Scenery
Decent character progression
Plenty of weapons to find, modify and upgrade
CO-OP!!! everything is more fun with freinds.
Ability to play again with the same character, skills and weapons.
Open-world ish with quite a lot to explore (I was still finding new things on my 3rd play through)
Loads faster and runs smoother than the original
Very pleased that sniper rifles don't look like toys anymore :D
Added option to turn motion blur off (very nice)
No major bugs (for me at least)

Cons:
Far from perfect storyline
Simple combat can get a little repetative
The new silver blood looks ridiculous
No new fixes, changes or additions (there was a lot that could have been done)
The new lighting is poorly balanced. For me, everywhere is either blindingly bright or pitch black.

IMO: Buy It

4. If you plan to purchase Dead Island Riptide, my very very major suggestion is to check out key-resellers to try and find a copy of the original. Do NOT buy this version of the game.

5. If you still plan to play this game, the only 100% character to make it through the game is Xian. If you don't plan on playing as her, I 100% recommend that you buy the original Riptide over this.",1465284392,1466316666,False,12,5,0.359034121036529541,1,True,False,False

After reinstalling my drivers several times and using a backup mouse i realised this was never going to go away.

So put the game in the exclusions, and it should be ok. (No, don't turn off your AV, you may be at risk)

This isn't just Techland's way of scamming you for money. For once, you can actually tell that a AAA developer has recognised what people seem to enjoy and have worked around it. 
I would definately recommend to anyone , however the experience is SO much more fun if you have a friend or two to play with.

Just one bug i have found though, and that is; With Logan, whenever a Zombie latches onto me and i punch them away or even just kick them, it's like i am the fucking Dragonborn from Skyrim or some shit cause EVERY zombie just goes flying and their limbs just explode. It was hilarious at first, but it's kinda annoying now. (I havn't tested this with other characters yet, so im not sure if its just for Logan or a bug in general :L)

Yo, Sam. We back bitches!
Good grip on that hook shit
Full fighting in front of the bull pit
Bad bitch don't take shit
Fucked last week been dead since
In the muck one time, kill em all with one line
From the swamp, bump and grind, ain't with the game no shoot and chop
Ain't no soft mouth when is gold, Can't hang low where the demons go
Cats don't talk they bleed in filth, one disappearance nobody see shit
On a different plane, take it outside it's so insane
Sam right rip real simple and plain
Sam B mother fucker ya'll in hell

No room in hell
Reservations go bad, and the guest list is closed
And the last one's alive, and the devil locked his door
No room in hell

When the dead start to rise, and there's no place to hide 

Eat a brain while getting brained
Conductor on my zombie train, all aboard, kill a broad
Leave her bloody, choked and stained
Won't play games no slick talk, devil dick like a pitchfork
No super suit, no bat cave, just shrunken heads and dead stock
I'm Mossberg on 2Pac, BIG with two Glocks
Big L from hell and back, collecting heads in my napsack
Ghost rider with no chains, spawned life with no ?cake?

Let 'em know we're going to need a lease
I stay hungry I need a feast, didn't I tell you don't feed the beast?
Went and got a little holy water and put it onto my Jesus piece
Got her wet like she's seen the beach,
And I think your girl's going to need to see a priest.
Say I'm ill when I'm over seas, couldn't see how that's not true.
My jewelry look like ??? and my neck look like ??
Girl you got to be psychic, if you think that I'm crazy
I would show you my good side but what have you done for me lately?
Every day would be heavenly when she call me up and I stop through
Every day I look to the sky and thank god that I'm not you

It's still pretty clumsy in terms of gameplay. I mean, they haven't even touched the fighting system; compared to DL, it feels stale and very repetitive.  

Pretty much all  the characters  featured are forgettable. In DL, every person had a fucking personality. Dead Island is full of dull people with horrible voice-acting.

BUTT ( YES, a wild butt appears)!!!

It is still pretty enjoyable. There is something very relaxing about this game, and I think I'm going to give it a chance,

-

- in beginning of game in the boat, kitchen area there are doors open that should not be open shows only empty rooms with nothing in em

- some physics are bugged like jump attack that comes from (''F'')(button) if you are above eneamy and it is very long way and you manage to get that ''F'' icon to show you will jump that 8m gap flying trought air and hit it

- some miss placed objects that go trough walls / some that are not connected correctly like fuse boxes on wall but there is 30cm gap(floating objects) and some chest that are 30-50% in wall :/

- Floating objects ( they are rare to spot but when you do it is pretty hilarious) some random fruit plates etc tiny things floating next to a table when they should be on table
