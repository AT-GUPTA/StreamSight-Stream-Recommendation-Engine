I have played U boat in early access for a few years now and followed its progress from the beginning until now when we are gearing up to finally see its full release. While different from games such as the silent hunter series this game stands apart on so many of its own merits and doesn't even need comparing to the SH series as so many people like to do. It is simply amazing and that is an understatement. Do yourself a favor and buy it, whatever the price may be it is worth it. While there are always a few changes and improvements I would like to see they are always pretty minimal and the dev team over the years has implemented on their own most of the things I wanted to see. Some of the things left I would like to see are more historically accurate uniforms, U boat crews did wear a lot of civilian clothing but sometimes with the way it is now it ends up looking pretty goofy. The other is changes in water clarity and atmosphere. For instance when I am patrolling around the Caribbean it would be nice to see clear turquoise blue water.

1) Offer more missions and more varied missions because it quickly becomes repetitive. Including missions other than sinking merchant ships.
Propose missions in the United States and Japan around 1943 – 1944 (and a few additional supply submarine). Missions against English ports during the Battle of Britain, in Leningrad during the Russian campaign, in Tunis during the African campaign etc...

2) Propose more improvements for the submarine because in 1942 all the improvements were already made. And then nothing more (maybe extend the search time too).
Propose different weapons that can be installed on the bridge (different cannons, different anti-aircraft guns, etc.) The 88' cannon must be earned...
Being able to improve diesel engines (faster)

3) Being able to play with England and France (and for France after 1940 we choose if we join DeGaulle and fight with England or if we join Petain and fight with Germany).

4) Offer more complete crew management. It is still too restricted. This point needs to be clearly improved.

5) Being able to change home port freely in exchange for one or more reputation points. We could finish the missions attached to this port whenever we want.

6) Implant enemy submarines which escort convoys and allow combat between submarines.
Enemy submarines must be sunk with T5 torpedoes...

7) Give the possibility (after a certain level of reputation) to command a squad of submarines (up to 4 or 5 submarines for example) and the number of submarines under our command increases with the medals (which would make them useful).
With very simple commands (attack this ship/defend this ally...)

8) We earn too many officers in mission rewards. Finally they are useless (we use all 7 on board and 3 at HQ). Change rewards with emblems to customize the submarine and be able to personalize it as little as possible.

9) Reward the destruction of cruisers and aircraft carriers because for the moment we are not encouraged to sink large enemy warships (new type of submarine or other reward). Play a very short cutscene upon returning from the mission when an aircraft carrier has been sunk.

10) Give the possibility of adding a storage space by improving the submarine.

11) Create missions to earn more T3 (normal and LUT) and T5 torpedoes (HQ missions ?)..

12) Propose more skills for officers (more possible skills and more point to be awarded).

13 The naval academy is useless. Raising the levels of dockside officers serves no purpose. Officers are expected to gain unique skills through training at the Naval Academy.

14) False flags should be unmasqued more often 

15) Maintaining immersion should make it possible to keep diesel engines in periscopic immersion during bad weather.

16) When an officer goes to sleep automatically reassign his sailors to another officer.

17) The rifle and the helmet are useless. We need to find a use for them (increase persuasion during merchant ship checks?)

18) Make quitting the game faster ! please !
(option return to windows)...

Now, on its own the game has some cool features like when you zoom in on the map there's a circle that is your view range, it turns 3d and you can see your ship and its surroundings as well as spotted ships. There is no way to disable this, but mods do this if you so desire. That brings me to mods, if you want a 1:1 replication of the torpedo launch computer then you can get it right off the workshop, or you can suffice for the simpler in-game computing methods. There's a mod that removes the view range 3d thing from the map, there's a different mod that removes all ship markers from the map and the only way you can navigate is by using your tools. There's a compass mod which allows you to get a degree angle off of the compass tool on the map, as well as a UI compass with the rudder screen. There's a mod that overhauls the already great looking VIIC sub and another that adds 300+ emblems to the conning tower. Historical flags, gameplay, etc. etc. Workshop has you covered.

On the way i got to know the uboat and i must admit its actual a quite nice game and i was very much impressed later on.

My mission started like in silent hunter series with navigation on the map, but what is different in this game is you have the option inbetween 1st and 3rd person view and walking arround your self both on the uboat and example on the harbour area to talk to your commanding officer and get your orders.
You have 5 men you can control while the rest are sailors who just do their thing, later you can get 7 officers in all wich means you can repair more or assign more to sonar/radio ect.
You other mode is a sidways mode where when you roll the mouse can zoom in and now the game all of a sudden is kind of a rts game where you select a man and ""go to""  this or that and do this or that... it work quite well.
and if you hold down ALT key you can see and overview of stuff you can click or turn.
In 3d person mode you walk around from room to room and can interact with all things and example turn off electric engine and turn on diesel engine, or turn off/on other stuff.. this work really well.
On my way to deliver the spy i was surprised by a plane that dive and drop debth chargest near me and i took damage and ended on the bottom of the ocean and i thought well at least im safe here from another attack so i waited it out before surfacing again.. Here i changed to 3rd person and wow it was dark, people in panic and water pooring in and crew injured... My front torpedo room had taken the worst hit and 3 people was down, and big holes..
Since i am new to this game I made some bad dicissions and saved my crew first and then plugged the holes... or at least you could only plug the hole and reduce water intake by 90% so room was lost no matter what..
Anyway i closed the hatch and gave up saving the people ;-(  and now i focus on emptying water from all other rooms.
In every room ( sideways  view ) you can click a blue water drop icon and then your crew automatic use buckets to empty rooms and pump it out in the ocean....  Anyway long story short I surface and killed a little torpedo ship with my heavy machine gun and started sailing home with enemy chasing me like crazy.. I guess the plane and boat had radio my possition to other who came to hunt me down..  I again ended up on the bottom of the ""low english channel"" and this time I dont think i wasent able to surface again RIP... ;-(
The game is a sub game/simulator with a mix of role playing game and 1st and 3rd person.
The way you change view is really well done.. Example double click your officer and you jump to his work possition and then you can continue his work ( example listen to radio ) or leave and now you are in 1st person.
If you roll your mouse you jump out in 3rd person, and if you continue roling the mouse wheel then you go in external view and can see the inside your ship. If you roll further you get an external view and can rotate the camera arround your ship and view arround you..   If you find the enemy there is a target camera that allow you to jump to target and see it in external view.. .
You crew can level up along the way and get more skills and you can even send one crew to do research so you can upgrade your ship with new sonar or other stuff. And its a good feeling and you feel kind of connected to everyone since there is a think line inbetween just 1-3 dying becourse of depth charges, since it very fast can spead to the rest of the ship.. The ship do have slow motion, normal speed, fast, and super fast speed depedning on what you do or where you are.. so even in extreeme situations you can micromanage crew.
You can even buy or use special equipment that you store in your locker. Example puton a diving suite and you can dive a wreck.. or use a rebreather and go in and repair stuff your men without cannot. We can even take some cargo after a ship sink and find suff such as food ect.
ANyway game look nice and cool, but take a little time to learn and master.
Shooting with the deck gun is well made.
However torpedos i only tried calculating a shooting solution and having my crew fire it automatic.
However i can see you have all of the map tools and periscope sight and so on, so technical speaking i imagine you can aim, calculate and shoot your self though it dident try yet.

All in all the games mix of views actual is really unique and after abotu 1 houre of play i think to my self this is kind of cool and give me a really good atmosphere.
I would say the AI is rather badass.  It shoot rather good so you should not take any chances.
By the way i like you can sail with only the tower over water, that way you are harder to detect and can sail with your diesel engine on rather than using electricity, that is really nice.",1556735169,1706964078,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,True

Revisiting the game over the last year or so, it's exceptionally clear that the developers have put a lot of time and love into development. Big respect. In it's current state, it's highly enjoyable but there's no true story element and the missions themselves are repetitive after a while *currently*! This developer is highly engaged with it's community, they regularly put out development diaries about progress and upcoming features/simulations. I fully expect once this game goes to RC (release copy), it will be the best sub sim on the market today - Ubisoft can't even whiff this quality, love, dedication to the sub sim genre.

There's not a thing about this game I don't love, I only wish we could RC sooner than later but I also know good things come to those who wait.

The Good
* exceptional detail to the u boat simulation. if you want to really get into it and manage a crew, funds, reputation, campaign, this appears to have a lot of the details
* a lot of UI - you can wander around the u boat, flip to maps, command characters to specific actions
* theme is great - really like the concept of the silent hunting, patient game of a u boat

The Cons
* clumsy UI - easy to literally get stuck on screens and not know how to get out or what to do next *even during the tutorial*
* the detail of the game sterilizes the actual gameplay experience. It is so much moving, task switching, map watching, that for me the actual periscope hunting, aligning, firing and, most of all watching torpedos hit is all lost in menus
* the graphics of the u boat are good but the graphics of the environment and, laughably, the torpedoes sinking ships is circa 1990s.

Overall, i am going to try and watch some videos online to see if there is a better path to learning and enjoying the game.

I'd love to see more ports and submarine varieties added, as well as more fleshed out skins for AI. The level of customisation for your own crew is reasonably varied, but it seems that all enemy troops have the exact same uniform.

Another example of a nitpick is that you can't see a port is ""Coming Soon!"" (not yet implemented) until you've come within close distance of it. That could mean you potentially wasted hundreds of miles/km of travel to find out.

____________________________________________________________________

Very good game that is held back by bad voice-over design (lack of situational triggers, intonation, repetition, unfitting context etc.), terrible animations of crew (people running into each other, getting stuck, having no animation for sliding pass each other like you in the real world etc.) and probably most annoying of all, the terrible UI concept, that screams ""we added features along the way and had no overarching concept to make the controls consistence across all parts of the game, so we just went with it"".

I think if they put a focus on animation/voice over/UI/controls overhaul, this would probably be the best WW2 subsim / management game out there, even beating the classic SH3.

Right now, it's just a good game if you are willing to torture yourself to get into it, so that you just condition your brain to memorize the inconsistent different controls schemese that collide at every corner in this game.

That is why I give it a positive review. Buy it, if you are a person that can endure bad controls and get used to them, and is willing to invest the time and frustration. If you get past that point, and can ignore the bad animations and voice overs, you will get to the core of a really good game.

Update: Gave it another chance after watching some videos on youtube. I managed to figure out how to actually find ships to sink. And after playing it for several hours, my conclusion is that 10% of the gameplay is combat and 90% of the gameplay is managing the ships fuel and peoples health, sleep and mental state. Basicly 10% stuff you wanna do, which makes a game fun and 90% borring stuff, that you really dont want to do in a game. I don't care if it's realistic, if it is as boring as this s**t.

Today I wanted to continue and met with the following bugs/issues:

1.) When using previous save (from yesterday), it is impossible to leave the port. After defining the route and setting the speed, the submarine starts moving towards the first point of the polyline, then after passing it, it turns back and tries to reach it again. So the submarine keeps going in circles in the harbour, hitting the walls until it stuck as you can see in the following videos:
https://youtu.be/mlQvnvRYStE (Map view)
https://youtu.be/X20A3gQnGJQ (3D view)
This is a critical bug, as it prevents me from finishing the tutorial. If I leave the harbour controlling the submarine manually, then the tutorial will not continue.

2.) If I use the previous save as above, the whole sea gets defined as “shallow water” and I cannot speed up the time enough to reach my destination in a reasonable time.

3.) I cannot create a new career anymore. After setting the difficulty and click on “Start”, I stuck on the loading screen. (I waited half an hour for the game to load: nothing happened.)

for addition, strangely i can play this game using old 6 years old low-end laptop with just 8GB ram with minors issue beside low FPS, i play on my laptop because my pc always end up crashing with no errors message when approaching land or entering harbor, or when saving and hoping when it crash on my laptop atleast i can know the problem, my total play hour is 6 hours in my PC, and 3 hours in my laptop. i dont know how unstable this game is, a more modern pc with more processing power crash often, but a weaker and old laptop play it with no crash at ALL

EDIT:
they fixed the performance issue flawlessly for me, worth the money, i will gladly paymore

I've never played any of the Silent Hunter games before (Even though it's different developers, I hear people say this is a ""spiritual successor"" in a way), but I cannot stress how amazing this game is. I wasn't really sure about it when I bought it, but it looked so good I wanted to give it a try. Needless to say, I am completely addicted to this game and I would DEFINITELY buy this at full price. Although it can be a little tough sometimes, it really capitalizes on some of the stress of being in the Kriegsmarine, especially when you are hiding deep in the ocean while Hunter Killers, submarine hunting groups, are overhead listening for you. Even if you know nothing about submarines or history, I still enthusiastically recommend playing this if it seems even remotely interesting, and if your knowledge is limited, it can really help your comprehension of how morale was during each stage of the war for the Third Reich, as well as give you an idea on the strategic importance u-boats played in damaging Great Britain's economy due to its dependence on naval trade via u-boats sinking important naval targets, including unarmed cargo ships or mine laying around the British Isles.

I don't normally leave reviews and I'm sceptical about early access games but this surprised me.  Having played Silent Hunter III with the TriggerMaru mod I had high expectations.

The graphics are high definition and the audio fidelity is rich.  I found myself quite immersed in the authentic atmosphere that the game provides.  

The crew system is still a bit janky, assigning crew to schedules is unpredictable and the UI when assigning crew can be cumbersome.  There is no visible radar station which was disappointing but not a big deal.  

Torpedo course can be a little erratic sometimes and calculating angles on the map in resolutions above 1080p can be challenging due to the font sizes.

I hope the game becomes more moddable as I see a bright future ahead of it.  Definitely worth a buy if you enjoy simulation games.

I went to Germany and boarded a real U boot, I got a real feel for what these guys went thru, every cramped and ugly compartment.

This game after a few updates now has my blessing, U boat is most likely the gold standard for U boot game play. I have thousands of hours on sub sims, from 688 attack to everything in between. Here I am at UBOAT.

If you play this game properly there's little hope for survival, as was the standard in the real world.

For 14 dollars you will not find a better u boat simulation. There are other good ones from eons ago and this one beats them all in perspective.

   Final update Game release All updates below are pre release 
WOW the devs are extremely committed to making one of the best Sub sims ever. The work they have put in vastly goes past my best expectations. When i first played this game i knew it had potential but THIS IS GREAT.  A must have for any sea worthy players and an amazing experience. They are only making it better and more streamlined removing time consuming issues in the game making things less grind and more rewarding. Constant updates patchs and fixes. I only hope they decide to add other subs like japanese or american for a free play experience to change up the game as a whole. LABOR OF LOVE SHOE IN.

Even with Updates etc its just a real PAIN to do missions , EASY missions are a Nightmare, Enemy AI spots you INSTANTLY even with only periscopes up , way out of their view range etc. which leaves you a sitting duck or the slowest getaway ever.

Wouldn't recommend as a casual player.

Game is not that big, but requires some bigger potato than others.  

I have waited for around 3-4 months to buy this game, everytime when it came on sale I've received a notifcation. It kept me thinking and got the benefit of my doubt.

You join in and get greeted with a nicely made intro screen. I forgot how the intro goes but it doesn't matter for my kind of review. Like the top-rated review already said, I want to like this game. I want to like this game sooooo bad.  
It actually is a nice idea, everything is there, but the main thing are those 'little' details that ruin it. 

As someone out of the navy (luckily not in the 1940's) I've always hated naval games that only go into 'forced battle mode' (looking at you Cold Waters). As a submarine, you hardly will ever be in a fight. When you attack, you lose the most valuable reason to exist for a submarine, being hardly findable. In this game you are free to go everywhere (when you buy that at the Headquaters). You sail out of the port, which you can do manually and also automatically which gives you a feeling of control, which I like. I can't go into comparison of the physics etc. You can sail anywhere you want. Ofcourse, this game unlike others is really focussed on combat because it was the era for that. 

The game follows a hardly noticable story line where you see the progression of the world, which countries declared war and more. I won't go into detail but that is what I like. Those details need to be more visible. 

Then the combat. Jezus Lord help me here. It is a bummer when you are playing it on max settings mode. I've watched alot of tutorials, but I still can't figure it out. 

And then, the numerous crashes. It's insane. You start, load your UBoat full of supplies, and skip days, you ensign on an order of Admirality and you sail out. You work hard for 30 minutes and you crash. Over and over and over again. It's insane like I said before. All your progression gone. It's the reason why I started 'cheating' by using commands to speed up your progression. Those cheats are by the way made into the game's console.

The lack of updates. I've never seen an update. Maybe the developer is busy(?). 

This game deserves so much more attention. I guess, when you fix most of those bugs, stress-test here and there, this game can get alot more interesting. 

Again, I want to like this game. I really do, but the lack of updates, the lack of attention given to this game has driven me crazy to the point I'm writing this review and giving it a personal thumbs down. It's a hard choice, because I really do have liked it sometimes, and it is indeed an exeptional game, but it isn't there yet. 

As a disclaimer, I have a bit short of 20 hours in this game, and I know it isn't much, but as a game like this one fails to provide what you expect of it, and you uninstall this game because of those faults, you fail as a game to keep your customer catched to it. It wasn't interesting anymore, just the fear of losing progress and crashing made me tap out. Give it more attention, fix the bugs, stress-test here and there and I think this game can reach new hights (I think, I'm not an expert c;).

(Back when I was training to be a real submariner!)  So I was excited to finally see a successor to the famous and infamous ""SH"" series finally appearing early last year. I bought this when it first appeared for sale, tried it but found it too buggy in the early pre-released state and shelved it until about a month ago and started playing ""for real"" in early June when I heard that it was stable enough to actually play. So now with over a hundred hours in it's current state, I am very pleased to see that this is indeed a worthy successor to the old SH series.  There is a lot to like here already and I am excited to see where this game is headed as the developers and loyal modders are working hard to add more content and polish before final release.  I especially like the side cut-away view to see at a glance total ship function and explore all aspects of ship controls in an easy to use interface.  Crew management now has enough options to feel like your are in-charge of a real ship but not too much to feel like tedious micromanagement.  Another nice feature is on the map view; you can zoom all the way down to the action level and watch your torpedoes streaming to their targets and watch from above some very nice ship explosions.  Notice I am not a hard core sim fanatic, however there are ways to play that way here if you want plus some usable mods that can make the experience as hard or as easy as you wish. (Reality is: at full realism after 1942; U-boating was full of boredom and frustration with 70% of the poor sailors never making it home! Not interested in a game experience like that.) Still as of (2023) Most but not all features/mods are working perfectly at the moment but I can see the Dev's are working hard and taking feedback from the community and adding features to make this game something worth any Naval aficionado's time and money here.  With that being said, It would be nice to have more than the type VII boat available if that is indeed possible, if not I am happy the way it is.  Personally, I would pay for an expansion with that feature in a future release.  Also, a fantasy campaign where the war lasted longer and you could flesh-out the potential of a Type 21 U-Boat on the open seas in the mid-late 1940's would be an awesome addition to this fine WWII sim.   WWII in 4K is worth playing for hundreds of hours to me.  Which is why I don't load up the ancient SH series anymore!",1594208659,1701225476,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

While Silent Hunter III is the overall best UBoat simulator still (due to extensive mod support) its graphics are dated.

The main thing to set this apart from the (unfortunately very limited) roster of sub sims is the crew management aspect. This is... kind of frustrating, to be honest. For some reason, you're limited to what I'm pretty sure are ahistorically small crews (5 officers, 18 enlisted), and you can only directly interact with your officers. Some tasks will either be automatically carried out by the enlisted sailors, and some others you can click on the task object to have a sailor come over and carry out whatever task... but not everything. Like hey, want to swap the interior lighting over from white to red to get the night eye adaptation bonus? Only an officer can do that, for some reason. The small crew size also means you simply cannot have every position you want an officer in staffed, which is extremely frustrating given how poorly the AI sailors perform without an officer supervising them.

On that, as well- your crew AI is *braindead*. I'm sure they may get better as they level up, but their starting state is agonizingly bad to the point that you'll likely want to be personally performing watches and scanning with the periscope yourself. The watch won't notice an enemy aircraft until its about to drop its payload on you. The watch won't see eight smoke stacks on the horizon even when they're so close you can start to get glimpses of masts between the wavetops. Your watch won't see a ship within point blank range of the deck gun at night. It would be funny if it weren't so unbelievably frustrating. Meanwhile, the enemy AI can have flashes of omniscience. I will admit ASDIC isn't something I'm super familiar with, but it's extremely interesting to see an escort pinging away and then completely miss its depth charge pattern, but then reattack five or ten minutes later without the sonar banging away and get a perfect spread right on top of you. 

There are times where the time acceleration buttons on the UI will visible be unchecked (there is no ""1x"" button, the way you can visually tell you're playing in realtime is by seeing that all of the buttons are unchecked), and yet the game continues on in 16x or 48x speed. The position of the time acceleration UI buttons changes between the map mode and every mother mode. The map drawing tools are woefully inadequate for a subsim and, for some reason, won't allow you to drop marks or start lines from the position of things marked on the map. The tutorials are pretty light on information for taking like thirty minutes each. There is an overall clunkiness to things that speaks of a lack of polish, which is... concerning, given this game has been in early access for four years now.

Playing Uboat just makes me wish Wolfpack had a campaign.",1700713186,1700713186,False,19,1,0.550788700580596924,0,True,False,True

Still has somewhat of a clunky feel sometimes and a bug here and there, but nothing game-breaking. Really enjoying the crew management and simulation. I'd recommend it in its current state for people who are familiar with sub sims, but if you're new to the genre, it'll probably have a steep learning curve.

Biggest thing this game could benefit from is more information and feedback about why things happen or don't happen. Like, you order a crew member to turn on blue lights, and sometimes they just flat-out ignore the order, but there is not any indication why. Tooltips are sometimes scarce or non-existent, and there several of important features that are not covered by the tutorial.

Old review:
Overall, don't recommend. I just purchased this game during the Steam sale. Started the tutorial, got about an hour in and I hit my first issue. During the tutorial, one of my officers needed to repair a leak on the but sub wouldn't repair it. Ended up taking ten minutes to figure out in the UI that his current orders (dumping water out of buckets) needed to be cancelled, but by that time, the ship had mostly flooded. To top it off, I can't save during the tutorial, so if it breaks it has to be started over. Frustrating, but whatever.

Started the tutorial again. This time, the shipwreck I needed to find was floating above the water. Because of this, the diving mechanic was broken and I couldn't continue. I didn't even make it as far this time! Now I'm irritated, but decide I'll give the game one last shot before I hit the two hour mark.

Well, I restart the tutorial one last time, and the dang ship is still floating just above the water, and this time my sub is stuck under it! I manage to get out, but the diving is still messed up and I can't continue. 

Never have I been so frustrated with a game tutorial before. I really, really have been looking forward to this game. I also realize it is early access and I am not expecting anything remotely close to perfection. The UI was sometimes unresponsive and the camera was jittery and clunky, but I expect these kinds of things. However, I really should be able to get through the game's tutorial without mission-breaking issues, especially considering this game has been in early access for eight months now and already went through lots of beta testing before that.

First impressions matter, and considering this is the first interaction I had with the game, I'm refunding it before I sink anymore time in. I hit two issues that caused me to have to restart the tutorial, and I don't want to imagine what the rest of the game is like if this is the quality standard these developers are holding themselves to.",1577524378,1700692775,True,0,0,0.461424708366394043,0,True,False,True

This game released as early accesses which means it’s a mess, if you want a polished game WAIT till full release.

When you buy an early access game you purchasing a hope that the developers will fulfil the games potential but accept the game as it is, and won’t get upset if the game developers disappear tomorrow.

Having said that this game at the moment of (05/05/2019) is a mess, however for a team of three guys I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many patches being released so fast. 

The support for the game is good from the developer’s side and as a result of that fact alone I’m recommending this game.
For proof of how much of a labour of love this game is you need look no further than the fact that we have manual T.D.C, manual hydrophones and can play in first person view.....NONE of which was ever supposed to be in the game in the first place, as this was originally supposed to be a crew management game. 

In addition the amount of systems that is on this submarine simulator vs. what was simulated on silent hunter 5 gyro compass and ventilation with co2 scrubbers and correct hydrophones including distance dial shows the amount of research and hard work the developers have put into getting so many details right.

Yes it is bugged. yes at the moment of this review (05/05/2019) you can’t even save your game without requiring a restart meaning you get no progression....yes some people can’t even boot into the game ....but that IS early accesses.
So  why am I recommending this game because I believe in the potential of what is to come from the work done so far and believe the developers WILL fix most if not all the issues. 

I also believe that this game will be more modable over other similar titles so as a result of that anything the devs do not catches the modders I’m sure as usual will do magic with it. 

The last good ww2 sub game was sh 5 and that was so mod unfriendly, and yet look what was done with that game.
If any of what I’ve written here has given you pause to think, or you are looking for a finished game then wait till full release but if like me you see the potential and wish to throw away a token amount of money to support the developers then buy and enjoy what we get.

Just my two cents.

#1 Flesh out the Theater. It needs more ports. Leningrad, Kronstadt, Rotterdam (I see you're working on it), Brest, France. Probably some others off the top of my head. IDK, Istanbul? The Black Sea was a theater for German Uboats.
More non-British enemies.

#2 More Subs (you're working on it, and that is good)

It's the lowest sale price I've seen in a while, so I finally pulled the trigger, and I'm glad I did. I played nearly 6 hours before putting it down. That doesn't happen often.

The gameplay is varied enough that is remains engaging while you're learning. The tutorial is not quite complete, however it covers enough to get you out to sea. It's imperative that you review management faux pas before you get to sinking transports and patrolling vast swathes of ocean. You'll want to familiarize yourself with power, food, and fuel management to start. The game contains plenty of hidden depth, like skill trees for individual crew, research/development requiring certain officers based on their qualifications, and instrumentation that's only accessible through first person. It's a neat system to uncover, as again it is not something covered deeply in the tutorial training missions.

Because it's in early access, it is a rough sketch of a final product. It's poorly optimized for mid-tier rigs, and I am certain it would struggle on low-tier PCs. There is plenty of hitching and dropped frames between scene transitions, as you're constantly flipping between the world map, the orbital view, and the cabin compartment view. Add water mechanics, ship destruction, etc. and you have some slow downs. It's still 100% playable. 


Pleasantly surprised with this one. I waited the right amount of time to try it out. I love me some submarine films, so it translated to this game rather well. Where are the classic radar ping sounds, though?


Edit: There have been multitudinous updates since I purchased, but the game remains mostly unchanged. Lots of quality of life changes make it more accessible, and devs are nearing the full release with some big news the last few weeks about what's coming. It's starting to chew up my aging rig now, though. Some stuttering here and there where I didn't have it previously, but it's still enjoyable. Lots of mod support, too.

The game was initially funded through a Kickstarter campaign that exceeded its goal of CAD 20,000, raising a total of CAD 38,000 with the support of over 1,500 backers&#8203;``【oaicite:5】``&#8203;. After launching on Steam's Early Access, the game sold over 56,000 copies and covered its production costs within an hour after release&#8203;``【oaicite:4】``&#8203;. Later estimates based on data from Steamspy suggest that over 100,000 copies have been sold&#8203;``【oaicite:3】``&#8203;.

The exact profits Deep Water Studio made from UBOAT sales are not publicly known. However, it was speculated that if the game sold at a hypothetical price of $20 per copy and 100,000 copies were sold, the gross revenue would be $2 million. After subtracting Steam's 30% cut, which would amount to $600,000, the studio would hypothetically retain $1.4 million before considering other costs. This calculation is speculative and serves only as a rough estimate.

The studio also receives support from PlayWay, a publisher likely providing financial and distribution support&#8203;``【oaicite:2】``&#8203;&#8203;``【oaicite:1】``&#8203;&#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;. Other sources of income or financing mechanisms for the studio, such as direct sales, in-game content, merchandising, or potential investments, are not precisely known. It is important to emphasize that the actual production costs, further expenditures, and thus the real profit from UBOAT are not detailedly available to the public and such financial details are often treated as confidential.

- **Update Frequency and Content**: Players might express dissatisfaction if they feel that the frequency or scope of updates and new content does not meet their expectations, especially in comparison to other games with similar budgets.

- **Technical Issues**: If UBOAT has ongoing technical issues or bugs that affect the gameplay experience, this could be a point of criticism, particularly if such issues remain unresolved over time.

- **Community Engagement**: A lack of active communication and engagement with the player community can be seen as a negative sign, as it might indicate that the studio is not sufficiently investing in the feedback and opinions of its players.

- **Resource Allocation**: Should the studio appear to be financially stable, there could be criticism if resources are not being effectively used to improve the game or support the community.

- **Transparency**: A lack of transparency regarding the use of financial resources, development plans, and business strategies can lead to mistrust within the community.

These points are general examples of the type of criticism a game or studio might face and may not necessarily apply to UBOAT or Deep Water Studio. Actual assessments should be based on specific user feedback and critical analysis.

And it plays similarly, there is a short introduction and a sandbox mode.

How to play: You control your officers through the submarine, giving them various tasks such as cooking, opening/closing valves, loading torpedoes, disciplining the crew, using listening devices, etc.

Sandbox mode: You start in a port where you can buy food, spare parts, improvements, you can recruit people (there are different character traits) and you can take orders (easy, medium, hard). You then have the opportunity to achieve your mission objectives on the map. The map itself includes the Baltic Sea, North Sea and the Atlantic.

My first impression is very positive, UBOAT is not a Silent Hunter. It's more about management than the hardcore simulation aspect.

However, at this point I would like to make a few suggestions for improvement or things that I noticed:

- You should insert a kind of ""ledger"" where you can read your successes at any time, such as the total tonnage you have sunk, the types of ships, etc., how many deaths you have to complain about, how many survivors you have taken on board, etc .

- With ""Uboat"" you actually only operate in the North Atlantic, the North Sea or the Mediterranean. Even the Baltic Sea only plays a minor role. I would also like to see missions in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, etc.

- The Kiel Canal should definitely be implemented.

- Skipping time is sometimes possible (boarding a ship, diving to a wreck), but not (returning a ""Prisenkommando"" to the ship, picking up survivors, etc.),
This always happens instantly, i.e. the people are teleported back immediately.

- If you skip several days (for example when consulting a milk-cow) no food is consumed! After several days you still have just as much food in the galley as before.

Otherwise, I have to say that I have rarely played a game as captivating as ""Uboat"". The graphics alone always impress me. To everyone who still has doubts: maybe wait until the last big update finally ends early access and then grab it!

Terrifying in a way that exceeds any horror game, more realistic than a simulator and as thought provoking as some of the  memoirs of the period.

I'm British so the focus of the game is very much against my particular standpoint. However, this game makes the point that not all 'zombies' (you know who I mean) were blindly involved. Even when 'zombies' sink an allied ship there is an option to surface and provide aid. I'm not fond of some of the Captains but, at the end of the day, they were doing their duty. As far as they understood it.

Soldiers do what they do, you cannot blame them. Those in charge point fingers and the masses trust them and follow, regardless of consequences.

The game itself is an intriguing mix of sim, strategy and management. I've played many, many times trying to save all my crew as well as not sink more of my enemies than would be absolutely necessary.

I know this will sound odd, but I am quite old. My Father and Grandfather were both in the wars. My Grandad was a POW. I'm a 'hip' grandad to my own grandchildren and I do my best to keep up with current technology.

Although there is no way of teaching my grandkids the horror of war, I understand that a game like this is a good start. Fun though it is, the truth is horrifying beyond belief.

So the review of the game... Three Questions...

1. Have you WATCHED 'Das Boot'? You already have the game.

2. Have you SEEN 'Das Boot'? If you have then get the game. I'm sure it will strike home.

3. Have you neither SEEN or WATCHED 'Das Boot'? Then why are you reading this? Do BOTH then buy the game.

Graphically; the game is fine. Maybe not photographically perfect but it really doesn't matter when you are 120 meters under water. The people and machines are perfectly identifiable. It certainly beats the sorts of games I used to play back in my BBC/C64 days.

Sounds; are perfect, you know what is going on purely from the direction, type and intensity.

Characters; are identifiable, have their own traits and become people you care about. I know this sounds daft but take that as you will

Conclusion; It's a wonderful game. It reflects a horrible time and experience. Yet, at the same time, makes an entertaining and engrossing game. Is it perfect? No, absolutely not, but compared to many 'simulators' of it's type it is an education. I hasn't quite lived up to it's promise (yet) but still stands head and shoulders above many of it's rivals.

I hope you will play this game, however you do it. The senses of fear and claustrophobia are horrifying.",1697572609,1697572609,True,21,1,0.671265244483947754,0,True,False,True

This game simply draws you into the story of the Second World War. You feel the tensions, you have to work strategically, but at the same time you also learn a lot about the submarine. If you like management and you like thrills and excitement, then this game is for you.

Sometimes the game is confusing when it comes to the controls, or what the correct actions are in a particular mission. You can find that out by trying it, and there are tutorials. But sometimes you make a wrong move, or you don't know what to do at all. That can be a challenge, but can also be annoying at times.

I can definitely recommend the game! I rate it 8.5/10

Joking aside. Apart from the still rather bad voice-overs (which will now be revised in the next patch), the game is really really good. I played a lot of SH3, IV and 5 before, but SH3 is my absolute favourite. SH3 is also really old and the graphics are just not really brilliant. 

UBOAT has stunning graphics and nice crew management. Of course it's not finished yet and I'm still missing a few things, but the game is constantly being updated and should soon leave the EA phase. In the last few years, a lot has already been changed and improved, improved AI, better controls and quick menus, graphics improvements, stroyline improvements, etc. I still need realistic harbours and better harbour defences. But they are working on that right now. 

My best gaming experience so far: 
U96- On mission in the North Sea. PQ12 convoy, 13 ships with escort. Two ships sunk, destroyers chasing me and throwing depth charges. After 30 minutes one hits the stern, diesel and electric motors are flooded, power failure, Wilhelm hits his head and has to be treated. Attempts are made to repair the water breach, but the boat begins to sink quickly. Water in all compartments. Impact at a depth of 130 metres, hitting the seafloor. Hoping to not get bombed again, because no more spare parts. But after a long time waiting the leak can be repaired, but the boat is full of water, surfacing is not possible, engines are fucked. Boat has to be slowly drained via the pump, all damage can just be repaired and Wilhelm is doing better.Immediate return to La Rochelle. On the way back, water bombs attacked from the air, but gun crew hit the aircraft after a few minutes. Arriving in port, the crew is decorated and given leave.

I think the fact that you can make the crew do the torpedo solutions and that it has very clear and easy to use tools to start learning how to do it is an excellent starting point for new players, especially for ""must have my graphix"" people that can't appreciate their imagination. 


The goods:

1) Best graphics in a sub sim game. I will admit much needed for a modernization.
2) The fact that your crew members are individually actually doing something makes the game much more concrete and less abstract than other sub sims (SH3, where you just toss guys at the problem to run down a timer faster)
3) EXCELLENT BOAT FLOODING/BUOYANCY MECHANIC (makes it kinda hard for me to play other games).
4) Hard core torpedo solutions done manually still work, so you can play as hard core as you would like.
5) Beautiful boat interiors and first person mode integration.
6) Overall a wonderful game. Truly worth your money on sale or not on sale. BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE SUBMARINE/WWII GAMES, ESPECIALLY IF NEW PLAYER.

---

Negatives:
1) Uboat Expanded I deem necessary to get historical accuracy and to have a realistic amount of traffic as well as increasing the number of ship types.
2) In base game there are only really 4 different types of merchant ships.
3) Detection, at least from my experience, doesn't really take into account the complex set of factors that would get your boat detected. For example, at least in my experience, the angle of the boat towards a pinging destroyer doesn't change the detection chance. I didn't run into a thermal layer in the base game (20+ hours before installed mods which seemed to add it). It's just a dice roll.
4) Some just plane annoying busy work (why can't my crew just turn on compressor when I surface without a hydrophone contact in the past minute, for example).
5) Crew management is kinda a drag to be honest. It's just that you can't really set yourself up to make the boat run on auto-piolt and instead really need to micro manage any time you want to do something.
6) Only Type VII U-boats... it would be nice to have a type IX to do a more realistic Drumbeat.
7) NO OVERALL TONNANGE SUNK, NO HISTORIC LEADER BOARDS. Urrrrg.
8) Patrol objectives are a bit strict and unrealistic. Let's say I leave port, find a convoy while going to patrol zone. I launch all of my torpedos and have nothing left at all. If I radio BDU they just say go back to base, and your mission doesn't complete. This would be quite silly.
9) WARSHIPS DON'T REALLY COUNT FOR SQUAT! I get not getting points (or many of them) for sinking a destroyer, fine... BUT A BATTLESHIP OR AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER?! This is especially ridiculous given the fact that the allies had a carrier sunk and said, ""well, let's not put carriers where U-boats can get them"" in the actual war. You telling me a 4000 ton warship is worth more than air craft carrier??? In what world? Imagine if Prien sunk another battleship, wouldn't he be given a higher knight's cross award after that? Ridiculous.
10) Need more and better map tools. If you are coming from SH3/Wolfpack you will be very disapointed.
11) Need to be able to input target data to your torpedos in a much more accurate way / be able to use AOB instead of true course. Very annoying when setting up quick shots on alerted targets when you have to fiddle with the damn aob wheel which is way too sensative (it is impossible to, say, set an AOB of 0.0 exactly, instead you always have a +/- 0.3 error which annoys me, because then I have to edit the true course... 
11) Devs are doing new voice acting, whcih is sorely needed.
12) No instant ""rig for silent"" button.
13) 3knts submerged is not ""dead silent"" as that would be, more realistically, around 1knt at 50rpms. There is a mod which lets you set this though.

14) I might edit this later after some testing, but it seems, seems now, that submerging at higher speeds does not increase submersion time as it really should.

15) Needs more music, but mods, again, fix this issue. 
---
Conclusion:
If you are new to this type of game this is my top recommendation. If you aren't new to this type of game but are looking for better graphics or a different, more personal style of crew management I recommend this game. If you are a hard core simulator fan who wants everything just so and everything this and that... I'd say stick to SH3 with mods or find a group of people to play wolfpack with (although, it's graphics are quite bad for the time we are in, and could be better for a modern game... granted the fact that everything must be very snappy for a math based game in an online environment... I digress), as both are still the most ""realistic"" uboat games... granted, I do think that the boyance mechanics here are better.

Also, if you are a hardcore subsim player I'd recomend the mods. I'd agree with the devs of UBE that if you are new to the game you should do a few patrols to figure out the game before installing. I'd do 5 patrols as a noob which include several encounters with destroyers before installing the mods, but I'd do the mods sooner rather than later. I wouldn't for example, play all the way to 1942 without mods installed, as you loose the progress.",1696284110,1696284110,True,16,2,0.684336364269256592,0,True,False,True

For now I have to say give this a miss. There is early access and there is EaRlYaccESs - this is the second. In 13 hours I have completed 2 missions and restarted from scratch 5 times due to game breaking bugs. The main issue is that saving seems to cause some of the bugs, but loading seems to workaround some other bugs, so you get stuck. Research doesn't work, upgrading doesn't work, favors don't work, the deck gun doesn't work, carrying things doesn't work correctly,  missions often cannot be completed, docks sometimes don't work, some times crew stop being able to do anything, the list goes on...

I recommend the game, although it feels a little bit expensive to me. Maybe it is a good idea to get yourself introduced with sub games playing Silent Hunter 3 + GWX. If you found yourself a uboat fan (like me) then I'd say it worth buying this game at full price.



It has been more than 30 hours of gameplay since my last review. So, i think it is pretty fair to make a update.

Cons:

The bugs I have faced so far are:

1 - Time compression gets stuck. This happend three times in the first 4 hours of gameplay, for some reason it seems to have stopped. And I no longer face it. I think it is related to you select a disabled compression (like 6.5k near harbors) even though the options seeams disabled, you can select it and the game gets crazy.

2 - Your screen is locked with the UI (left alt) always displaying the cursor pointer, making it impossible to walk around the sub. This happend only twice, again in the first 4 hours of gameplay

3 - the game stops responding to any command: Esc, enter, mouse, space, F1, F2, F3., etc,etc. Nothing works at all, but there is a simple way to get yourself free: scroll your mouse whell up and down, and magically everything gets back to normal. Happens when I am at the UZO or the periscope.

4 - A minor one, sometimes my captain shaves his own head, no matter what hair style I select to him. Sometimes you see him bald, sometimes with hair.... seems a little bit random.

Now, the pros:

What differs this game from other uboat sims is the crew management: It is very intertaning for you to costumize them, assign them tasks, or send them to nearby ships as a delegation. Picking up survivors is another unique and very interesting feature I liked a lot.

Damage is another interesting thing: when you get depth charged, the lights goes out and the water start to get in, you turn your little lantern on and start to assign your crew to repair the damage while you turn the pump on and watch your depth meter. Seems like I am inside das boot or inside Erich Topp's interview. You really feel the tension.

First person: I just love to walk around my full moded sub, seeing my crew performing tasks and stuff. I just like it.

I bought the game with a 60% discount. At full price (30 usd), I'd maybe wait for the final version (to be released until the end of 2023), even thought my overall experience have been positive and I recommend this game.

In order to really succeed in the game you have to do all of the torpedo calculations manually.  It is a chore and slows down game play too much.  If you want to play arcade style you'll end up disappointed.  You can have your crew do the torpedo calculations but it takes them forever and you're being depth charged at that point.  Half the time your torpedoes end up missing when having the crew do the calculations.

The second problem is the lack of anything happening.  Yes, this is realistic but 95% of the time you're waiting to find ships to attack.  If you have lots of time to play this isn't a big issue but if you just want to jump in the game and have some fun, it doesn't work.  Even with the use of generous time compression, you'll still find that 95% of your playtime is just waiting.

Incredible, the sense of a cramped workspace. The first person view truly shows a machine of war that is very uncomfortable and can be claustrophobic at times.
The feeling of actually being on that submarine is really there.

The graphics are also good.
Sound, i have to get a better feel for it still. I cannot crank up the volume in my mancave at the moment,

I am still learning a lot of this sim and i am not fully up to date on all the things. But the things i've seen so far appeal to me.
It is in the small details, like having to start up the compressor after resurfacing. 
Or setting up a crew to inspect damage, or even the way you can assign an engineer to the command room so the boat will not breach at periscope depth.
Or even the planning of the mission, when stocking up on supplies. At first i did not like that, i had to get other submarine sims out of my head first.

And i could be wrong, but it looks like enemy ships inform other ships further away for help. I had an encounter with a destroyer once and before i knew it, many more ships had gathered around me to hunt me.
And when i crashdived, i ran into the ground. I knew the north sea is not that deep, but i still guessed wrong.
I love it so far, i still have to bag my first kill though.

PLUS:
*Plenty of options to make it easy or realistic.
*Graphics. Press ""u"" and you will see what i mean when you are out on the ocean, standing on the deck during a clear night.
*Immersion in general. I.e. the crew that do their routines and go about business feel realistic to watch.
*Great community with support and modding.
*FPS movement around the ship. Hatches can be opened easily when you just stand within reasonable range from them. Many games require you to stand in a certain spot before you can open doors/cross a location, uboat simplified these things. IE. going up/ down the ladder is a simple task that takes little time.

MINUS:
*The crew sound not only depressed, but also monotonous when they speak about the boredom. It truly feels computerized making a hilarious thing at first which turned a bit silly later on.
*I dont understand some things and it's not always easy to find a solution, making for a lengthy learning process. For me at least. For example, i still dont understand why pressing the ""periscope up"" button never works immediately.  It seems completely random. 
*Graphical twitch(es)?. Captain sometimes loses his hat and pipe when zoomed in, making him look like Kojak. But also clouds look weird, just like paintspots in the sky.",1671639865,1695235789,True,1,0,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,True

In this universe, Hitler slipped out of the shower when visiting his Hitler Cloning Plant he had constructed in order to have enough Hitlers to run the Reich for 1000 years, but the shower slip was fatal.
Panicked, his entourage demanded a clone that same day so no one would notice, but the clones weren't ready. They missed parts of the original Hitler.
Only one clone, code named Across Hitler, was like the original, except for the fact that this clone hated one thing more than anything else: swastikas!

Firstly, I only paid £8 for this title, so no real major lose if it sinks quicker than a soggy teabag.
That said, If your a fan of Das Boot (the real one not that sky Atlantic rubbish) you'll like this.
Whilst it's still in early access and it is a bit janky in places, it delivers on so many levels already.
The dev's are frequently updating and tweaking this title which shows they are actually dedicated to finishing and delivering their vision for this subsim.
Too many early access titles hit like a dud torpedo when they finally arrive at ALPHA release, hopefully UBOAT will stay afloat and become a massive hit.

 I had a few hours on it soon after buying it.  The map looked like it had been cut out of SH5 (which was a flop), and the steering system was terrible. SH3 could be easily controlled by mouse alone in any perspective.
 So I thought what the hell it's very early development, they will sort it all out by the finish. So I thought I would leave it until it was nearly ready for release (July 23) to have another look.  Not impressed at all.... 

 Well I've spent a good few more hours on it now, (Aug 23).  And it's growing on me now, still clunky but getting used to it slowly. There are a lot of MODs for it, but most are out of date now. Like a 2D map that still seems to work but it tells you not use it.  Well I'm sure the MODers will be all over it whenever it gets finished.
The graphics are VERY good, a little to crisp & clean maybe, but there are MODs for that too.
So I've changed my mind on this one, It's got potential....

 Now I've spent a lot of hours on it(Sept 23), I sifted out a few Mods that improve some things I'm not happy with. Now you can't get me off it. 
 If the developers don't quite get it right at end of play, then the MODers definitely will have a few cherry's to top it off.     Now I recommend this game.  Sometime soon this will be a 'must have'.

You need mods and plenty of them, not only to make them more realistic but to improve the gameplay!

My recommendation:
- Needless to say, play hard, (the more realistic settings).
- install TDC mod
   - Inside my collection of (realistic) mods you will find many useful mods [1]
- Play it on a 4K TV

Pros:
- Hours of gameplay
- Real time and accelerated combat simulation
- You need to think wisely, calculate targets, and finish missions without killing civilian ships from non-war countries.
- Immersive graphics, realistic ocean, clear or chaotic weather,
- You will need to administrate your submarine, load torpedoes, do the maintenance, schedule time limits for workers even when at war.
- amazing situation when the submarine is hit and water is leaking.

Cons:
- lacks customization but you have mods for that.
[1] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3030256858

To calculate TDC:

- LOAD the TORPEDo
- STOP the UBOAT (you don't need to be facing the ship directly)
- PAUSE THE GAME

- type 'M' to open Map
- draw a double-line (one that finds angle):
    1. on the middle of your submarine to the middle of the target ship.
    2. draw second-line always extending outside of the front of the target ship

- annotate :
    1. Km or meters (distance between the submarine and target)
    2. the angle resulted from the above line. as well 
    3. from the target perspective which direction he has to face to find you? 
        If it is LEFT then is RED or if it's RIGHT then is GREEN.

- adjust those 3 values from TOP to BOTTOM into the same line (inside TDC).
         - 1ST being the ship's VELOCITY in KNOTS per HOUR = almost 2x Km.
         - 2ND distance (between you and the ship) in knots.
         - 3RD ""Angle of Bow '' if it's GREEN/RED respectively the angle number calculated above.

Use your periscope and look directly to the ship, (all of this while the uboat is still and the game is paused) then press the valve at the right, a blue light will show.

At the same time press the valve at the bottom, that indicates everytime the uboat moves because of water, the data will be automatically corrected. And a white light will show.

Open the torpedo screen, check the little valve at the bottom right then press the small square above the SALVO display.

Although the hud of the game gives you advantages a uboat captain would have dreamt of having.
In any case this game has different qualities to silent hunter, it has super good imersion it has very diverse missions it has a super well made upgrade system and it has really good crew managment system. It also simulates the events of ww2 nicely.
It does have a few bugs but i think they are only linked to the tutorial haven't had any bugs since the turorial.
Overall recommend this game.
edit: i was wrong there are game breaking bugs that are not tutorial linked also i should also mention their are huge inconvieniences when you want to speed up time and your close to land.

Nice game that is fun to play, runs well and looks good.
Updates are a bit rare and needs a bit more content.

[b]The good stuff[/b]
There is a lot of customization available when it comes to the difficulty and controls of the game. If you are looking for an easy to handle experience or a fairly in depth simulation, this game can provide both and most things in between. Personally I started out with a the simulation set to almost minimum just to get a feel for the game, but now I am personally doing all the meassurements needed to get a torpedo to hit.

My current computer is a bit old and far from high-spec, but the game runs very well. Sure, I can get a few lag-spikes whenever there is a bit too much fire and smoke on screen, but with my garbage graphics card that is expected. I have a hard time believing that the game would be unplayable to anyone who has a somewhat up to date computer.

Even as I am running on low graphics settings to try and keep my half-rotten potato of a graphics card from exploding, the game looks very nice. The crew and the interior of the submarine are nicely detailed and the explosions look great.

[b]Could be better[/b]
The game is still in early access, and there are some things I hope will be improved upon in future updates. The team behind the game tend to take their time with the updates, but in turn every update has been a rather nice step forward.
(Except that one time they experiemented with some shaders that gave my computer a stroke, but that was fixed rather quickly)

Currently there is a bit of a lack of variety in the content. Two things in particular would be great to see: More ship types, and more harbors. For the ship types, there is currently very few ships within each category. Sure, it is rather nice to learn to identify the 6 different types of freighters and tankers without long and careful comparison to the pictures in the ship manual, but it does get a bit same-y after sinking 50 ships labeled as ""Similar to Empire Bell"".
As for harbors, I don't need more u-boat bases, but it would be great to see more harbors just for the environment. While Rotterdam is a big harbor, it is not the only harbor that ships headed for the Netherlands might have as their destination. It would also be great to have some more potential harbors to refuel in (if friendly) or to raid (if enemy).

[b]What about Silent Hunter 3?[/b]
I do believe that most of us who have an interest in this type of games have played or at least heard of Silent Hunter 3 - Grey Wolves. (if you are unaware, SH3 is an old game that is very similar to this one, and Grey Wolves is a mod to that game that is considered to be almost perfect)

In my opinion, this game compares rather well to Grey Wolves. The graphics are of course more modern, and it is nice to not need to fidle around to get such an old game to run at all. The gameplay and feeling of the game is rather similar.
The UI in Silent Hunter 3 went all in on the authenticity, while UBOAT uses a style that is a bit more clean and readable. Both styles have their advantages, and I can't say that any one is objectively better.

Grey Wolves does have a lot more details when it comes to depicting the entire history of the European side of WW2, and as mentioned before there is a bit of a lack of ship types in UBOAT right now. Hopefully this will be improved in future updates, but it is unclear if it ever will.",1693530462,1693530462,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

[h1] Personal Opinon [/h1]

Sad to say that the game is not running under Linux not even with Proton regardless of steam Proton or Proton GE I also have tried every fix on Proton db and Steam Forums even tried Proton tricks but nothing works the problem is it runs exactly until the game has to load the Mission it only loads the music but after that it loads to infinity and beyond and eventually crashes, so I had to stop the game via Steam so compatibility is seemingly ending at the loading screen after you determined the looks of your captain going back to play Silent Hunter 3 yeah its dated AF but at least it runs and is in a playable state unlike U-boat

Thus, I could not see the Game for myself, which is the reason I cut the other points out of my review.

The pros are that it is fun to sneak around in a uboat and accomplish tasks. Working to upgrade the boat and crew while avoiding allied warships and the stress of getting pinged on SONAR all make the game enjoyable.

Unfortunately, there are parts of the game that I feel take unnecessarily long. Imagine a cut scene of a boat and waves for 20 minute intervals to leave port because you can't speed up time any faster. I ran out of torpedos and had to spend 40 minutes to go back to port to get more plus I had to leave again (pro tip: try to not run out of torpedos). As I type this my crew has been working on one of the missions (setting up a weather station) for at least an hour including the transit, the slow scouting, and now the slow set up (I estimate the set up will take 45 min at the rate it is going. a glorified loading screen). I'm capped at 140x speed which seems like a lot until you consider the highest speed multiplier during deep water transit is 6500x. But if you come close to shore or a ship, even if you are safe and want to carry on your mission, it slow right down which drags out the encounter.

The hydrophone operator gives you an instant and constant estimated bearing and range for all contacts within 100km on even the hardest difficulty and realism settings. This makes plotting an interception course trivial. To be in tune with the idea of ""skill progression"" that this game evokes, how about having the hydrophone operator start by just reporting a bearing and signal strength, and then maybe one day he can estimate range and ship type or if it's closing and fading. This is a principle gameplay mechanic and I find it severely lacking.

     Also torpedo attacks against hostile shipping becomes overly tedious because there are only 4 types of enemy freighter. Speed finding is trivial because you just measure time, the comparison to vessel length is done automatically. Range finding is annoying because you can only use the stadimeter, and trivial because mast height in m is told to you but never matters. Angle on Bow finding is done with the mark 1 eyeball, making it impossible to make a precise shot even though this is an arcade style game. 

     I think this is a great game that a lot of people will want to play, however I can't pretend that I'm not seriously dissapointed. I've only played for 12 hours and I already feel like I need to go back to a 12 year old game from the Silent Hunter franchise.

To enumerate the problems with this game:
1. Unrealistic hydrophone
2. Unrealistic target data acquisition methods

Enemies will hunt you down and you need to use real tactics to evade them, this can be challenging and rewarding. 

Management of the crew is not bad, not too much micromanagement and they are generally smart enough to handle most situations without intervention as long as you set them up correctly, skill them up and have your submarine in the right configuration.

-There is a mission where you build a weather station and, I kid you not, you stare at a progress bar for minutes at max time compression waiting for it to be built. Similarly, when you send your crew to rest for 21 days, you stare at a screen at max time compression waiting for days to pass. In port. Boat is not moving, crew is elsewhere. 
-There is a tactical map but does not work since I can remember.
-UI is still terrible. 
-In Scapa Flow, I had several destroyers stop directly over me in extremely shallow waters, all dropping depth charges while stationary. We were all touching distance of each other. 
-When I reached the seabed, there was no damage until suddenly the uboat started shaking/rubber banding and got destroyed. 
-Did I say how terrible the UI/UX is? You really get to appreciate it, once you have crisis like leaks and damage.
One can tell these guys have never done this before but I wish them success. All they had to do was re-do SH3.

UPDATE: March 2022 - says I refunded but decided to give it another go. Huge mistake. 

Time wasted I am never getting back and £9.50 which would have been used better if cut into confetti. Hopeless Hunter would have been a better name for this ""game"".

For devs this is probably their first ""project"" and it shows. Also, a publisher pumping out 30 titles a year just to see what works doesn't inspire confidence in this receiving too much support once released.

Most frustrating - the interface of this game is in a disastrous state, it is just literally and figuratively speaking ALL OVER THE PLACE. Needs redoing from scratch.

So is the gameplay and mechanics.
 
I also encountered a game breaking bug which meant restart of the entire campaign. Plenty of recent reports of similar experiences. There is leeway for early access titles for things like this but not a title that wants to exit EA this year and, from what I have seen, the remaining development focus is on ports etc.
 
Surprised to see the positive reviews - guessing they are a result of sim community hunger for a uboat game so they accept this crap. 

Nov 2020
Was hoping for this to be the successor of Silent Hunter 3 but it is not sadly.

I honestly could not think of anything wrong with this game. In-depth mechanics give you a sense of how difficult it was to be in the Kriegsmarine on a u-boat. The different u-boats you may command cover pretty much the entire war and the historically accurate events increases difficulty the longer you survive. Damage control is difficult, yet rewarding when you get it right. Correctly determining the course of your torpedoes and even hitting just a small merchant ship is amazing every time. The AI (on hard mode) is smart enough to sink you but not too smart where they demolish you. You, the skipper, are not a hero and your crew aren't either; only a small part in a big battle.

The game lets you play a VII submarine of the German Kriegsmarine during the Second World War.  Unlike Silent Hunter III, you can only play one type of U-boat. Instead, there is an extended crew management which I personally enjoy very much. 
People who complain about this mechanic and therefore leave a negative review can turn this feature off in the main menu. People who complain about micromanagement have not looked at crew management properly, I have very rarely had to micromanage except in an alert, but even then only some officers. You can assign a station to each crew member individually, even the ""common sailors"".

The game has a very good atmosphere and good graphics, the difficulty can be adjusted, but if you have ever played a ""hardcore"" submarine simulator, you should play everywhere on the highest difficulty level, otherwise it can get boring very quickly.

The game is not always realistic, the shadow zone is much deeper than in reality, probably for balance reasons, but even on the highest difficulty level the torpedoes do not misfire as much as in reality. You can send divers to wrecks (which is awesome) and you also get spy missions. You can control neutral ships, sometimes they are smugglers so you evacuate the crew and sink it. There is also a land mission like establishing a weather station it is really cool but needs more missions. 

If you are looking for a hardcore submarine simulation, you will also have fun with this game, but there are a few things you can't do and there are alternatives on the market. (There are mods which make the game more realistic, but I have not tried them, since I wanted to have fun) If you just want to drive around with your submarine, commit some war crimes and stuff this game is for you. 

Game breaking Bugs:
I started at the 1939 start and after I finished the campaign regarding the british isles my fleet was transfered to Kiel and I started the norwegian campaign in early 1940. The first mission was already broken, I had to protect a convoy and after I sank three corvettes and three destroyers, which was very difficult and definitely not realistic, the convoy didn't move on to invade Bergen. I stopped playing from there. The rest of the game was fun. 

I hope someday there is a game like this with nuclear submarines fighting a hidden e-spionage war in the cold war, listening to sea cables etc...",1690396096,1690396827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I purchased when it was first released and have just passed the 2000-hour mark of play time. The dev’s have been outstanding listening to the community with improvements over several years. The modding community is also exceptional with bringing the game to life with real world items such as realistic interiors, food and supply items and a working Torpedo Data Computer (TDC) just to name a few. The only option I would like to see added is the ability to sail the type XIV U-boat (aka Milk Cow) and the type XXI Elektroboot. But considering the dev’s commitment to producing a very good retention of accuracy, that may be unrealistic. I’d also like to see the dev’s work a US Submarine operating in the Pacific during WWII. Again, I’m sure this would take years to complete but, I’d be one of the first to buy it.

Pro:
~Very realistic simulation (Sonar, torpedo trails, realistic reloading animation and etc.), perhaps not the most realistic graphic, but definitely the most realistic mechanic.
~Ability to swap between 1st/3rd POV, swapping game for either strategic or immersive.
~Hardness curve is very well designed, from nearly no escort at all to a whole fleet armed with radar and sonar, each step match well with the progress of the player.
~Realistic/Immersive atmosphere, the game becomes ever more immersive when under harsh circumstances (Try 1st POV when attacked by depth charge in 150m depth)

Cons:
~No multiplayer, could be added as a featcher later on, but currently with the lack of multiplayer also meant the limited playing time.
~Graphic could be better
~Only limited to the VIIC Class sub, could add other new sub in the future, like the IX class or the XXI class.

You and your crew are happily sailing in the North Atlantic, when you encounter a single ship. You attempt to get closer, but your electric batteries stubbornly will not charge, and you do not want to stay above water for more than absolutely necessary to avoid being seen. You cannot use your hydrophone, because going underwater uses electric engines. Therefore, you are left with making visual contact with the ship. Suprise suprise, its a destroyer.
You approach the destroyer, the destroyer spots you, and fires one shot at you.

In a matter of seconds, your ship went from perfect condition to having nothing working and a hull that's filled with more holes than most conspiracy theories. The natural reaction is to panic, and get your engineers on damage control. However, engineers can't fix 21 holes and repair 13 components at the same time, which leaves you taking on water and stuck where you are (the diesel engines will not work, nor will literally anything else)
All my engineers except one were also dead, which doesn't help.
At this point I decided the best course of action was to dive the submarine to avoid further damage.

This was the wrong choice.

At approximately 20 meters, my hull was crushed and the entire crew died.


Mind you, this was my first time out of port following me completing the tutorial.

How is one supposed to fix the ship at that point, which limited knowledge of game mechanics and how to ACTUALLY fix the ship?

1. Crew management - feels rewarding to use the same crew on multiple missions, see them receive medals and level them up.
2. Sailing in general. Visuals can be stunning at times when on higher settings.
3. When combat is set up properly it can be very satisfying.
4. Management of the sub in general. Once I learned a lot of the tools and stations I found myself constantly interacting with different crew and parts of the sub. It is very interactive. Would be cool to see more things like actual mini games (???) when dealing with different stations. 

Things I don't like:
1. Not being able to load/unload torpedos/mines while underway. I've read in the forums this seems to be a common problem. Had to reload save and do it in port before mission just in case.
2. Camera can be very janky at times, especially when underwater.
3. Multiple missions where you send crew to investigate a wreck or conduct diplomacy resulted in those crew disappearing from the mission entirely. Not sure if maybe this was user error, but I could not seem to retrieve my crew from investigating a wreck on multiple occassions.
4. A lot of individual management systems can use tweaking i.e. crew leveling, order queuing, etc.",1688588420,1688588420,False,1,0,0.527777791023254395,0,True,False,True

I've played submarine games since my very first DOS PC, with Silent Service 2, then Silent Hunter series etc. 
However i'm not considering myself a hardcore fan of the genre,  i simply enjoy this type of games. i'm a bit lazy and play at medium difficulty with some aids (i can definitely play them hardcore too, but most of the times i just don't bother).
This games scratches the same itch as the old games.
The way it progresses, with short term and long term goals (like research etc) is a very nice way to keep you involved.
There are some critics about the crew system (some ppl say the game is SIMS uboat) but i think you can disable most of it. 
Some people are critical about the repetitiveness after a point (go there, patrol and shot targets) but tbh this happens in most of the other similar games too, what did you expect? 
 Overall i'm having a great time. Every moment of the game i'm involved and excited to hunt my new targets, never been bored for a single moment. 
 Its still e.a. and i hope more content (DLC or mods) will keep be adding, this game has the potential to be really great.

So, you could be right next to a target, and you have to wait for cross-eyed-Hans to figure out a torpedo solution. Saving and loading is terrible and seems to forget your mission state. And even though you can cycle through different years into the war and even different ports, I did not see anything except the type VII. Boring.

The tutorial is seriously broken, I was asked to rendez-vous with another sub; I literally bumped into it and the game did not detect it being in the vicinity. The dialogue screens with mission directives can't be clicked away. I turned on the radio but couldn't turn it off. It just adds and adds. Absolutely broken.

- the gameplay itself with micro-management of the crew
- the graphics of the U-Boat and the environment abroad the coast and ports are excellent
- also the textures of ships, planes and espercially warships  are excellent
- the developer payed attention to a lot of details (loading screens, inside and outside of the uboat, uniforms, medals,... ) 
- it is recognizable AI is getting better and better in the late years of war

What is bad?

A) TECHNICAL/ATMOSPHERE
- the game is lagging all the time even with modern hardware but CPU and GPUare never fully occupied.
- RAM consumptioni is getting insane. In the beginning of my career (Nov '41) it started with 11 GB  and with moving forward the game needs 18GB (August 1944).
### --> Technical conclusion: engine and coding are horrible! ###
- graphics/textures of ports, towns and the HQ are also horrible and outdated. Even worse: alle ports are based an 2 or 3 templates,
- hardly no entry & leaving animation sequence with civilians, music corps, honor guard and a taunt line on the uboat with white flags of sunk enemy ships (this was amazing in Aces of the Deep and a huge motivation with a feeling of coming home every time)
- way to longs intervals of updates (& testing) are inacceptable

B) GAMEPLAY
- Caluclating torpedos works with the tools of the game but only with the Torpedo-Distance-Calculator-MOD it is more practicable and of course more realistic! Without the TDC it is quiet impossible hitting moving ships from any angle!
- getting rewards is way too easy and earning money is such a dumb solution... If there should be a currency for research/better gear it should be handled just with gaining prestige. More prestige -> better uboats/gear, more ressources, better crewmen
- there isn't any development for the normal crewmen. Only officers are able to get some special skills.
- for every function on the uboat a officer is needed... :dumb
- research should be kicked out of the game and better gear should be granted by prestige earnings (even with penalites in researching new equipment, I had all availalbe iteams after 3 Months (beginning 1942)... even those which were introduced to ubaots first in 1944)

Overall if you like semi-realistic simulators this is a must have for the experience.  It sticks to true WWII dates and events so timeline realism is pretty good.  My only chief complaints are (1) the limitations of audio as there could be more sounds and music choices.  (2) Fast-forwarding can sometimes get stuck and you'll crash and sink.  And (3) little tiny bugs that pile up to get annoying, but does not make it unplayable at all.

The game allows you to play super casual with heavy automation or change the settings to make you nitpick and manage each and every thing just like in real life.  All-in-all, definitely a must have for any WWII/History/Simulator player's collection.

If you're a hardcore immersion/simulation nut, you'll enjoy steaming around the oceans in real time or if you prefer speed things up you can speed the time up from 12x to 6500x. You can plot your own courses via vanilla navigation or you can dive into the mods and add sextants and real world course plotting via simulated celestial navigation. You can play in first person or third or both. My point is this game is highly customizable but the people who will love it most and see it's true depth are the simulator junkies who don't mind slowing things down for the sake of immersion and realism. 

 This is not an Arcade game nor is it for people that need over the top relentless action. For me personally some of my favorite times are simply being on the sea and enjoying the beautiful and thick atmosphere that uboat has created. From the beautiful sunrises and sunsets to the brutal storms, the sea is much like it's real life counter part. 

 I spend my time on the Sea working as a Deckhand on a Factory fishing trawler on the Bering Sea so when I say this game makes me feel like I'm on the sea then you can bet it does the sea right. I know no other game that compares. 
At the time of this review the game is on sale for 8.99US. This makes me sad as this is a game worthy of 60.00US or more. I see some truly bad games with 60.00 prices yet this gem is under 10? This tells me something if not many things are broken in the gaming community.

 This game is still being updated, looks and performs like velvet, it has an active modding community, seasons, tides and is non-linear in that while following historic timelines leaves how you handle your part in the war entirely up to you. You can start out in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland before the UK joined the fight and be notified of historically accurate updates via radio reports as to who is considered enemy and the rules of engagement that should be followed. In the early war nothing was yet known so it really feels like you're taking part in a war which is only just starting. 

 You can also start on different uboats at different points in the war if you prefer start at another time. What tickles me however is that you can play every single day of the entire war if you wanted too. (unless you get killed somewhere along the way.) You are not obligated to fast-forward anything. This game gives you the option to play in 100% real time. The war was 6 years? Welp if you wanted too you can make it 6 years real time. A day is a full day but you can always fast forward. For me I fast forward most of the nights and play mostly days unless there is a tactical reason to play at night, such as attacking a heavily protected convoy. 

 The anxiety of battle in a submarine as you listen for the screws while staring off into the depths of a valve or hydrophone reading as your hearing becomes your greatest tool is beautiful. You try to visualize what you can't see via sound and eventually experience. Standing in the control room under blue-light staring at the ceiling of pipes and valves as you desperately try to visualize the direction of the enemy screws overhead and outwit their commander/s.

  Scenario: A warship is searching for us, it pings us and then we hear the screws rpm go up and start getting louder. We know now they know where we are and are trying to get into position to depth charge us. I know this from sound alone. We dive below the salt line deep deep to mitigate the enemies ability to detect us on sonar but not so deep that we send ourselves to our deaths.  The boat creeks and whines under the extreme pressure. You hear dripping echoes throughout the control room. A valve or pipe bursts from the pressure and you have your engineers do damage control and repair it. Everyone of your sailors, officers and yourself are drenched in the sweats of fear as everyone is glistening with perspiration. You expect to have to stay under for a long while so you turn off batteries to non-essential compartments to preserve battery life. You turn off all noise making equipment and tasks from the sailor sweeping to the gyrocompass to be truly silent. Standing in the control room you hear the hydrophone operator whisper yell ""Wasserbombe!! wasserbombe!!"" (Depth charges) set deep we wait until they finally meet their trigger depth and the boat shudders violently, Sailors cry out! The commander is wise and uses his wits to order full foward 90 degrees to starboard and change depth to 150 meters. He knows taking advantage of the noise from the depth charges to camouflage his change of direction depth and speed is an essential tactic to staying alive. The noise from the depth charges go silent, but the commander has already ordered a full stop as the cover of noise is now gone. We wait, we know we'll be pinged again. PING!! sitting at 150 meters he knows many things that he's learned from training and some things you only learn from surviving bit will it be enough to keep him and his crew alive for the entire war? That's on you.

My point is that this game is not a dictator, it's a world and an experience that is open for you to dive into as deep or as shallow as you like, it's a thriller, hunting, survival, resource/personnel management, horror and adventure game all at once but most of all it's an emulation of a way of life in a time when living relied heavily on the goop between your ears. You are more likely going to limit yourself then the game is going to limit you. 

As for bugs. I will say after hundreds of hours of play I can not think of a single bug that bothers me other than little things that are no detriment to anything. These bugs include the occasional inability to move through a hatch in the command room  in FPP. (Easy to fix though and therefore hardly worth mentioning.) Another small bug which is annoying is while playing as one of your officers in FPP should you go to the map for a second and then back to FPP the officer you're playing as will all of a sudden be in a different part of the boat forcing you to have to walk back to where you were. This is most problematic in FPP mode only and has no effect in third. These are the only 2 bugs i can recall which means whatever others there may be they are too small or infrequent to be recalled. 

 On the reviews talking about bugs, most of what people are referring to as bugs are not actually bugs but a player error. For example someone mentioned that the torpedoes are bugged because he saw his torpedo track through an enemy ship on the map but didn't blow up and just kept going. Well this isn't a bug, the torpedo solution for interception with the target was correct but the depth wasn't so the torpedo didn't go through the ship like a hologram it went under it. You need to make sure you identify the type of ship you're firing at so you can take into account it's draught and then set your torps accordingly. But what if you've done that and still no boom? Welp you're probably in rough seas and the enemy ship is porpoising on the waves so it's possible for the ship to lift above your torpedoes depth. This is all very realistic. The best thing to do in this situation is set your torps to MZ for magnetic so they don't need to impact the ship but simply get close. Just keep in mind it was a fact of war that the early war torpedo pistols had chances of dudding or exploding before impact or not engaging because the angle was poor. The accuracies and inaccruacies are authentic to the types of torps you use and of course this technology improves over time as better pistols were developed. 

 This game is not going to make big bangs just because you pulled the trigger. You have to take many variables and the situation into account to make things go boom. This is not a run and gun things go boom game.

- Tutorials help with learning the game when starting 
- Encourages you to approach situations tactics you pick up throughout your time playing:
 Want to be sneaky and infiltrate a large convoy to cause chaos? You can do that
 Willing to take a risk and surface your submarine to make use of the deck gun to strike convoys to conserve torpedoes for a more lucrative target you may find? It's possible, but not recommended especially when escorts are still floating.
 You can also choose the year you start in which also adds to the difficulty. Want to start at the outbreak of the war? You can do that. Want to throw yourself into the deep end and experience what it was like for u-boat crews in the latter parts of the war in which allied technology and experience makes it more dangerous to attack convoys in the Atlantic? There's a start date for that.
- Play how you want, whether that's by turning on all realism mechanics and challenging yourself or by mixing and matching the mechanics to fit how you want to play
- Evolving world. As you play, history will play out as it did through out the war from the invasion of Poland, the conquest of France all the way to hunting Arctic Convoys heading to the USSR

Cons:
- The auto navigation system can sometimes freak out, causing your submarine to ram any and everything in sight whilst trying to leave the harbour in which your sub is based

This game was one of my top favorites management style games. Before full release, I highly recommended this game to anyone even not on sale, however I am going to make a negative review because I can't play this game anymore; not after they removed the ""Dynamic Campaign Movement"" feature when they left early access.

What is Dynamic Campaign Movement? Well, the game world is large. Incredibly large, about 1:1 to real scale. So traveling 1,000km in game takes about the same amount of time it would in real life using realistic movement speed. That's why they offered what I considered a revolutionary idea of dynamic movement. So, when you were out of range of other ships, or land (out in open sea), if you had DCM turned on the game would simulate traveling large distances on the map and speed up time. In the game, things would happen and the ship would move and animate in 1x time relative to the real world, however on the map you would zip across the quadrants really quickly, and the days would pass in a matter of a couple minutes. This made travelling thousands of miles possible in around 20-30 minutes real time, without you having to run the game with a 120x time compression. It made actually sailing the distance yourself and managing your crew while you did it fun and immersive.

Now the feature is removed because allegedly a lot of people complained about it being glitched and having other performance issues. I never had any issue with it ONCE. It NEVER game me any problems, and was always an absolute Godsend for making 2,000km voyages actually palpable. You can only run the campaign in real time, which means to get long distances you HAVE to use time compression. Why is this an issue? Well, to most people it might not be, but to me it is because viewing your ship sail on the ocean is like watching a tape on fast forward at like 60x speed. The boat flips around and glitches and stutters with a motion blur. The immersion is gone, completely. AND using this game mode gives me performance issues.

This was how another subsim game I had was done. Silent Hunter 4: Wolves of the Pacific. I had to be careful using time compression on that game to travel across the Pacific because it would often cause my computer to crash. Going from 1x to 120x back to 1x, back and forth, put excess throttling on the CPU, like slamming your foot down on the accelerator then slamming on the brakes, then flooring it again. It's not good on a car, or your neck.

So until the DCM is re-added to the game I most likely will not be playing it at all. And a negative review will remain. Please, please bring it back. I like this game and I want to play it again.",1686783626,1686783626,False,189,4,0.764795839786529541,10,True,False,True

The game is workable, stable and generally playable. 

But it has bugs and really game breaking bugs. Sure, it's early access so you should expect nothing less. There is quite a lot to like here. But the bugs do let it down quite a lot. Time compression is a killer that will cause you no end of grief. 

There is only one type of uboat to play. The Type VIIC. You can upgrade the boat with more and better AA guns, better batteries, snorkel, anti radar detector, better hydrophones, access to better torpedoes etc.

But there is no other boats to choose. Patrols are generic. Go out, sink merchants ships, go home, be rewarded. 

Crew management is a pain to get right. And it does not always work either. 

Enemy AI is what you'd expect from a very minor game development studio. Going from pin point aim to dumb as a post. You can get a single destroyer who defies all logic to not only detect you, but pin point your location and drop depth charges that land perfectly on top of you. And if you take damage, even the most minor damage, you aint got a chance in hell of fixing it and surviving to limp away. They either miss you completely by 100m or fall literally down your top hatch into your lap. 

And you can enter enemy ports, sink 10-15 ships, some merchants and some warships with no opposition. Maybe a warship will wake up and hunt you, but eventually they give up and sail off into the sunset, leaving you to slowly sink every ship in the port.

Missions exist but are scarce and limited. Go here, do this, return. 

The game gets very tedious near the end of the upgrade path with little to do other than, go here, sink as many ships as possible. The end. 

All in all, the game is good, but it's a good idea to realise that the whole point of the game is to accept a patrol location, sail out, sink ships until your run out of torpedoes and return to be rewarded. Then, you repeat that until the war is over. 

That being said, there is a very solid 60 hours worth of gameplay here. The developer updates are almost non-existent. Many months in between them. Many are speculating at this moment that this is abandonware. I do not know.",1686234910,1686234910,True,24,0,0.702356100082397461,0,True,False,True

It runs its length pretty quick because as it stands there really is no ""game"". You blow ships up, make bars go up and that's that.

You can pretty quickly become an ubermensch Kapitan with enough practice and figuring out how to actually intercept and sneak into a convoy and get out without dieing. Getting to that point can be annoying trial and error since a lot of really important details don't really become clear until they bonk you over the head.

[h1]Crew management:[/h1]

- You can micromanage a lot like your crew health, morale, food stocks, meal quality, sleep, stress, etc. OR you just let the AI handle everything by themself. You can edit the setting to suit your taste. 
- Each crew member has their own back story, they can be level up and unlock more perks, they can be killed by drowning, bleeding. Sometimes you will see your sailor blown into the sea and drowned because the u-boat tower was hit by enemy artillery.


[h1]Visual crew and submarine interior:[/h1]

- You can see and walk around inside the submarine, doing variable things from cooking to fixing stuff. Inside the u-boat submarine is very alive. 
- You can see sailors sleeping, chatting with each other, playing card(poker) game, cleaning, cooking, maintenance machine/torpedo, etc. 
- When you resupply the submarine, you can see your crew hauling stuff from place to place, see them cleaning, heating the torpedo and putting it into the torpedo tube.


[h1]Submarine damage:[/h1]

- The u-boat can have variable types of damage, by bad maintenance skill, or by sea mine, or by enemy deep-charge, or by enemy gun, etc. 
- You can see the crew running all over the place and fixing stuff, depending on location, they may use other objects like boxes to help them reach the higher place for easier fixing. and even use a bucket to contain leaking water. 


[h1]Graphic:[/h1]

- The sea water looks real.
- The model looks detailed.
- The sound and visuals of rain weather are satisfying. Especially for a person who loves rain like me.
- Sea water or rainwater will drop on screen/opstic, making it feel realistic.
- Crew looks detailed and has an emotional expression.
- You can see the crew sweat when they are inside the submarine too long. 


[h1]Realistic movement:[/h1]

- When you give an order, your crew needs time to process it, because they have to go over there and do things. 
-Order your crew to target enemy ships? You have to wait for them to calculate stuff before they give you the information about that ship, it took time, or you can do it by yourself for saving time (if you know what you are doing)


[h1]Free Roaming and a lot of missions to do:[/h1]

- You can free roaming all over the sea to hunt or explore, scout the location before taking the task. 
- There are a lot of missions which you don’t need to do in order, choose which one you like and process it. 
- Each mission after you reach a certain point, it will unlock new difficulty and also more reward. Mission may change depending on years and (historical)events.


[h1]Mod support and also easy to mod:[/h1]

- Yes, this game has plenty of mods, from very simple to overhaul. 
- The game is very easy to mod by yourself, by editing the xlsx for weapon damage, submarine health, price, etc.

However, just within 2 restarts of the new game, I have encountered some very frustrating bugs and inconveniences which gave me a cold feet. I will just put this game to the shelf and wait at least a year to give a headroom for bug fixes.

- Mouse Zoom/pan/orbit operations: REALLY requires a full-overhaul. In its current state, the mouse operations are really inconvenient. Mouse navigation needs some rework on F3 screen.
- Objective window masking background: As a new player, I started with tutorials, at the very first tutorial, it took me a while to be able to click the warehouse guy. Again, related with orbit issues. But this time objective window is also masking the warehouse. Don't forget that we haven't spend countless hours playing yet, we are new players. We don't know how things work. I knew this is going to cause problems, and it did later.
- When later in the tutorials; The objective window + selecting officer + assigning post don't work in harmony. Objective window masks background, I could hardly click my guy, it took me AGES to assign him to the AA gun (storage kept opening), even after assigning, the objective window didn't disappear and slowed down game like 4-8 times, so I literally waited 1-2 minutes to watch guy slowMo running and manning the turret. In between, sometimes the game sped up suddenly and slowed down.
- The tutorial objectives are leaving you just like that without finishing: Ok, we need to go to a point to sink some ships. Good. Went there, sunk first, sunk second. Then, dive down and searched for the third, and... ? Nothing? After a while, I returned to the port, can't get new missions? So, the quest says I'm still on sinking convoys. Ok, went last location. And then... Nothing? Oh also, for some reason, it kept saying ""you need to stick to surface"" and didn't let me dive anymore. What is going on here? I needed to run ""new game"" to solve this.
- Location mismatch: In the map view, the journal location and the location reported on the top right when hovering mouse on the map are in harmony. But these two are not related with the actual square! So, what you see on the map doesn't correspond to the actual location what game thinks it is.
- Game leaves you just like that #2: On the patrol mission tutorial, same happened. I went to the location, I got the distress signal. Navigated to the location, sunk the destroyer (!). and then... Nothing? The point is gone from the map, and the game left me like that. No updates on objectives. Returned to the port, same story.
- Semi-automations are not well thought: If the air/water pump is smart enough to stop by themselves, why not ordered to start automatically by officers? They definitely feel that they are in the water until their belly, I think they should be smart to call for water pump.
- Really missed the commands from silent hunter: ""Man the deck guns"". Wow, how convenient that was. 
- Torpedo solution modifications becomes permanent and can't be rolled back: So, a destroyer was circling me. Officer had %100 solution, however, I just modified the solution so that I would fire the torpedo a little bit back than where it would go. Yes, I hit the ship! Now I need second fire. But, how can I ask officer to re-calculate and overwrite my changes? It was stuck at broken state and no matter how much I ordered skipper or another officer, it didn't change to a new calculation.

After these frustrations, I couldn't dare to actually run a mission. I couldn't even go past the patrol tutorial.
If you ask me; the game needs:
- Serious UI overhaul.
- Mission system rework.
- Better judgement on where to time compress and when to slow down (i.e: Should slow down when the final point is reached).
- More interactive real-time torpedo solution management.

In its current state, I found myself fighting more for the control of the things in the UI or mission bugs instead of actually fighting the AI. All the things I encountered literally made the game unplayable at this point.

I really do want to play this...

I really wanted to like it, but I just can't.

As most others, probably, I come from Silent Hunter III, IV and V. It is mind boggling to me, how this game fails to achieve what even vanilla Silent Hunter III, which came out in 2005(!!), achieved. It just feels bad, somehow. Sadly I cannot even point my finger and blame something specific.
It feels too arcadey, it feels historically inaccurate, the management, while good in concept is done subpar. Sure, vanilla SH3 also was lackluster (when looking at it from today's point of view), especially when it comes to mission variety - yet everything else just was spot on. An example are variety of ships. UBOAT feels like it has a roster of 10 ships - used as placeholders for everything. In SH3 there was a huge variety of ships, some of them very rare, making them special to encounter. UBOAT has none of this. Every convoy feels the same. 
UBOAT kind of feels like SH5, where similar ideas were tried to be implemented, yet Ubisoft just failed spectacularly. Personally I have not played modded SH5 so I don't know how much it could be improved. 

What I give the game is that it looks good. Well, kind of. No, the water and the Type VII look good. The surface ships have....varying quality and the planes seem to have placeholders more than finished models. The harbours look alright, more or less, if lifeless as hell (just like the rest of the game, SOMEHOW).

I gave this game two chances even - I bought in on release, refunded it because it was just lackluster as hell and now, nearly 2 years later. The improvements feel minimal for what time has passed.  The pieces just dont fit together and I dont think they ever will, without extensive modding. 
But some things can't even be fixed by mods. The game's performance is abysmal. I doubt even a NASA computer could run it without problems. It frequently lags out, freezes completely after giving an order or when time compression changes and more. It also has some bizarre bugs. For example:


- Ships not taking damage when torpedos collide with them (duds) but instead sinking halfway under the sea, just to emerge again.

- Newly transferred crew refusing to actually enter the sub - the stand on deck and drown when you dive.

- Overmap vision range just not working. Sometimes your watch crew observing the horizon just isnt registerd, it's all grey.

- Convoys spawning on you: rare but it sometimes happens that when you are in time compression it goes back to 1x and you are suddenly VERY near or inside a convoy. A death sentence.

- Spitfires as BF109 placeholders. That one killed me. Not really a bug but I wanted to mention that one.


These are just four of many, many bugs. But these were some I encountered in my last patrol (and many other patrols before).
Some design choices are also honestly incredibly strange. I read people saying you shouldn't compare it to Silent Hunter, which personally I find weird because that is what they clearly went for. It's like saying ""don't compare it to Das Boot"", yet this was clearly the intended goal they went for. But what design choices are so strange? Here are some things that have not been changed since Early Access release in 2019(!):


- want the boat to go on battle stations? Where is the button for that? Oh, right, there is none. Why? Who knows. You instead turn on the red lighting, instead of the normal one. Not that it really makes any difference.

- Silent running - same thing as battlestations. A button does not exist. You turn on the blue light. But nothing changes really. Again.

- Most relaxed combat situation ever. Why do you try to go for the immersive route, yet have the crew trying to sleep WHILE being depth charged? The crew doesn't really care. If they are on battlestations or silent running, they are still depicted as normal. Meaning the cook cooks, some guys are playing cards or trying to sleep. Highly immersive.

- No attachment to your crew. SH3 had some basic crew progression (they could be given medals, specialization and sometimes promoted). Most of this is missing in UBOAT (except the medals) so your crew are just names to you. You dont care if someone dies because it is impossible to get attached to them. Strange design again here, too - when hiring them they have a short blurb of their backstory, yet you dont even know what rank they have. Sailors and officers is the most shallow division you can do. Believe it or not, the Kriegsmarine also had NCOs and everyone had a rank to them. 

- I mentioned the medals and they are hilarious. Without doing anything out of the ordinary it happens more than just sometimes that your crew receives Iron Crosses before they even get their U-Boat Badge (the base version you received for just being on 2 patrols). Its hilarious that you have the most decorated U-Boat crew in history after like, 3 patrols, where you did almost nothing.


I could go on forever, because there is a lot of this. And don't tell me there are mods that fix some of this. All this shit was in SH3 vanilla and it was done a thousand times better.

Just to clarify - I want(ed) to like this game, badly. Silent Hunter III, even with LSH is showing it's age more and more. Yet nothing is there to replace it. Also, please dont come and tell me that the UBOAT devs are like, 3 lads. That's alright. But then the priorities were wrong. What does a UBOAT management system do me any good, if the rest of the game is bland, lifeless, boring or straight up broken? I respect the work that was put into it, and I don't want to sound like an asshole, but it just didnt work out for me, sadly. I HOPE it gets better, but I don't think it will ever be what I hoped for. Not without LSH levels of modding.

All in all - don't buy it. You are not missing out, really. There is nothing here that hasn't been done before and better (with or without modding). I will gladly update this review when things have improved. If they ever will.

1. The learning curve
2. Resources required to run it

I managed to overcome these problems and I’m glad I did.

When I first played the game, I didn’t have a clue how to play and I was sat at the dock for ages trying to figure everything out. Frustrated that everything took an age to do because of framerate issues and lots of lag, even on lowest settings because I didn’t have a beefy enough PC to run it. I ended up refunding it, and forgetting about it.

Fast forward 1 year I decided to watch UBOAT tutorials on youtube, curious as to where I was going wrong before. 

I watched lite ly salted’s tutorial videos and started learning the mechanics of the game. How to prepare the sub, how to select missions and upgrade the sub, how to operate it, plot a course, how to manage the crew, their needs and skills, how to plot a torpedo course and sink enemy ships, how to avoid warships. Learning the different functions inside the sub and when to appropriately use them. It suddenly looked so rewarding and something started to click. 

So I upgraded to a gaming PC with a setup good enough to run it on max settings and 162 hours later, it’s one of the best games I’ve ever played. 

Once you tackle the learning curve, it is a great, addictive and rewarding strategy game. Many of the bad reviews I’ve seen suggest that the reviewer either does not know how to play the game or their setup is just not good enough to run it as I have experienced.

Bugs - yes there are some, but they are not game breaking for the most part and I barely notice them. It certainly does not take away from the enjoyment. It is a well ironed out game with frequent updates from the developer who clearly care about the game enough to want to better it. 

It is a visually impressive game too and can be very immersive. 

If you have a powerful enough setup to run it, and love war strategy and resource management type games, I highly recommend it, providing you are willing to watch a few tutorials to learn the basic mechanics and not expect to jump straight in and knowing what to do. However if you are familiar with other games of this type such as the Silent Hunter Series, you may pick it up quite quickly.",1683980606,1684144763,True,19,0,0.729873895645141602,0,True,False,True

Cons:
The updates that have taken literal years could be completed in a weekend by a single dev. 

Despite the entire player-base asking for new subs, even if it was DLC, they've been ignored for years.

The player-base has asked for research expansion. Things as simple as a 105mm upgrade (Despite only 1 Type-7 being known to have been fitted with one, it would be just as ""realistic"" as other upgrades.)

Only 1 single play-style. You play through WW2 and your success/failure is of little consequence. The game starts and ends the same way no matter what. No option for a rogue play-through or turning the tides of war. No option for playing an alternative country. No option to crew a destroyer or battle-ship (which would be awesome but there's no way in hell this Dev team would even attempt something like that). 

It's fun to manage your crew and upgrade your sub. However, after you're done with upgrades (which you can do within a year in-game. So pretty dang fast). It's nothing but shoot merchant, dive, throw decoy, escape, repeat and return home. Then that process repeats in an finite loop till the war ends. 

Pros: 
It's cool to hit ships with a torpedo.
Surface combat can be fun sometimes.
yeah....

The only submarine game I played before this was Aces of the Deep when I was about 5-7 years old. So, I can't comment on how it compares to Silent Hunter or other submarine games. However, for me it has been highly immersive, challenging, and rewarding. I absolutely love the realism and complexity. The satisfaction of sinking an entire convoy and sneaking away while corvettes and destroyers frantically try to ping you is unmatched.

When they do find you, and you hear the sonar ""PING"" off of your hull, you know you are in serious danger. Diving and maneuvering to hope you can lose track while Depth Charges explode around you. When one hits and leaks burst into your sub you frantically order your men to repair the damage and save any wounded men. 

You have the option to play and view in First Person Perspective which feels amazing. You can feel the tension when you are sitting on the sea floor 150 meters below, hearing the hull creek, and the characteristic churning noise of ship propellers as they glide directly above you. Not knowing if they are about to unload depth charges and seal the fate of your crew.

I see a lot of people complain about bugs recently but I have not ran into any game breaking ones. There is a bit of a learning curve but through trial and error I have been able to masterfully sneak through convoys and sink multiple ships at a time.

At $30 or on sale, this game is well worth the price.

for example, in november of 1916 HMHS Britanic was in the agean sea when she struck a mine. the resulting gas bubble from the explosion lifted the britanic partially out of the water twissting her frame. as a result her rudder was jammed. were it a merchant vessel instead of the HMHS britanic, and were it torpedoed rather than struck my a mine the resulting torpedo attack would have the possibility of causing a great deal of damage to the ships engines were the torpedo to strike her in the engine room. this would cause the shipi question to lose speed or even become dead in the water. 

so, you may be asking why i bring this up. the answer is simple. ships that are torpedoed in game dont seem to lose maneuverability like they should. DWS should make an effort to correct this as soon as possible so that we have an even more realistic and satisfying game.

another issue i have is the available space for deck gun ammunition. a uboat had the following as a standard load out prior to leaving port

40 AP rounds
160 HE rounds
40 SS rounds.

there should be plenty of space on board for a total of 240 deck gun shells with room to spare.

The game is very engaging, always having you thinking of your next move, considering the consequences, I even found myself spending 20+ minutes considering who I’m recruiting onto my sub in terms of officers and crewmen based on their character and performance. I got so attached to the crew and especially the officers that when my first officer casualty came around I was legitimately upset. 
All this a side, not really a criticism, but more an heads up to new players, this isn’t a game you can play casually without much thought input.

It could use more variety (the ships, subs, planes, etc. are pretty limited at the moment) but what's there makes for a pretty solid experience. Hoping they flesh it out later once the official launch has happened.

My only other complaint is that the first-person-only mode, while adding to the immersion, feels less polished overall. I'm not sure they've put as many hours into testing it as would be ideal. This is not to say that it doesn't work, just that moving around the sub and doing things in FPV feels a bit janky sometimes and may require some finicky clicking on things like ladders.",1680533863,1680533863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I like that the game stays true to history and the time period. I've always enjoyed reading and studying history, so it's really neat to immerse myself into the time period. I also really like how time works in the game, a second is a second, an hour is an hour, that really makes the game feel realistic and adds to the suspense of an attack run or the evasion of depth charges, damage control, and the hopes of seeing the surface again. The game runs well and looks excellent. The difficulty levels are great and compliment the players ability to learn the game and adapt new strategies. The game feels well thought out, implemented well, and gives a sense of what being on a u-boat would have been like. The developers clearly had a vision of what a good and fun u-boat game should be and stuck to their formula. It feels intelligent rather than a typical shoot this and that, and run over there, and ooo collect this and that game. Which is like 99% of every game made over the last 20 yrs. 

So thank you to the team that made this game! I needed a good engrossing game. 

Side note: I get a kick out it sometimes also, for example: Finding a naval port at midnight, calculating 4-6 torpedo targets, keeping the ships stations alarm off, got an officer cooking, one playing cards with the crew, one cranking music through out the ship, fire torpedoes, plot an escape route, surface, turn on the diesels, and head out of the area at full speed cranking Ride of the Valkyries!

Actuall review: 

Very good value for the sale price of under 8 euros. There are very basic things missing like a compass while using the map (you use the map 95% of the time for navigation). 

I hope the devs actually manage to do the promised full release in 2023 but I have my doubts.

Some call it a 'lite' uboat sim- there is currently no TDC in the base game for example, though there is a superb mod that fixes that. It is also perhaps not as historically accurate as GWX (i'm no expert), but again, there's mods that can improve that.

Having said all that, I am having a blast with this game and it looks gorgeous. There is a lot more focus on the crew and their management than other sub games which I find very appealing and which adds to the immersion in my opinion. The movie 'Das Boot' is a story about the people as much as it is about submarine warfare, and this game nails it - the stakes feel higher as you become invested in your crew. Fear not though, if you don't want to manage all aspects of the crew you have various settings to suit.

It is tense, and at times stressful when the depth charges are dropping. It has become my favorite game of the moment and I am very glad I bought it as it ticks all the boxes for me. In a nutshell I love it! 10/10.

I've been playing WAY more then 16 hours playing on a friends account; and I hate to say this now but I wanted to support the devs and bought the game. Then a month later they ""Officially"" release the game and man am I disappointed. I understand a game needs to eventually release but man this game still lacks content and a variation of it rather then copy and pasted missions and cookie cutter rinse and repeat. This game has so much potential as it is truly one of the better games I have ever played from a tactical standpoint and visual one. Being able to First-Person inside the sub is like WOW! And there's nothing more intense then 1st POV while sneaking around or having a ship overhead dropping depth charges. But this game still has a TON of bugs, doesn't allow for TRUE sandbox, switching campaigns around the globe is a nightmare, the ""side content"" like base management and officer missions are a joke and are simply cut and dry. The world never feels ALIVE like you're actually apart of it unless you're on the sub in the middle of the ocean and frankly it's dead there too as none of the crew chat with you as you walk by or anything. The only thing I think this game ACES is the sub combat and the rest falls flat, truly and it breaks my heart to say it because I wanted this game to be BIG and be a platinum hit and get 10/10 ratings but the dev team seem to have just not put in the effort needed or asked the community for content they would like to see. Also - the menu system is so ugly, Perks/skills, inventory, market/traders, officer missions; it's buggy, uninteresting, and bland. So much potential here.

Content that would be nice to see:
Better Inventory
Better missions and content - Major and minor missions
Actual live world with a breath atmosphere
Base building that actually serves a purpose
Officer missions revamped
Radio room actually serve a purpose rather then 3 things
Add dialogue among sub crew and make more problems you have to solve between crew mates
Allow you the ability to be promoted in realistic manner and change campaigns
Have Sub rescue if you get stranded (No gas, damaged ship, etc)
Rework perks and skills (Good skills just bad system)
Add benefits for 1st POV and actually doing the jobs yourself
Add more ships upgrades and perhaps different blueprints/ships
Add more content and missions for boarding ships/Scuba to wrecked ships
Just bring new content in general even though I already said this.
Talk with your community.

I highly doubt this game with get much attention from the Dev team even through they say they will work more on it, but man this game can be SOOO much more if they decide to buckle down. I've read your dev logs, visuals are cool and all but content is what keeps gamers playing --- not rain effects and tides.

I'm an old school vet of the Silent Hunter series, and while UBOAT stock misses some of the important details (no TDC, course compass control, etc) it gets so many more of them right. You manage a crew and have to get to know your ship inside and out. Damage isn't an abstraction: if you get wallopped, you need to figure out how and where to apply the fixes. Days and nights are real, not just loading screens: need to send your crew on vacation? You'll watch your boat at the pier speed through 21 days.

There's research, varied missions, and a big helping of nods to the Wolfgang Petersen epic, Das Boot.

And those things missing from SH? There's an active modding community that's got you covered. But you don't need them, either - casuals can enjoy this as well.

I’d bought it early on the development and, at that point, I wasn’t happy due the large amount of bugs and lack of gameplay fun.

Yes, it’s already playable as it is now, but still there is work to do. And I hope that the announced 2023 update will incorporate many more ‘Pro’ features.

Maybe it’s only personal, but I recon that the U-Boats would have those handy everywhere 😉

My previous review was positive, but I spent more time focusing on the controls of the game, which what problem was there was just a matter of me needing to get used to them more. They actually make a lot of sense. The trouble for me came from my experience playing strategy games with overhead maps that I'm used to rotating the view on. There is plenty of rotation in the game but the map doesn't have the rotate feature. It's really not a problem though as the zoom in and out view is so expansive. 

Furthermore, I am updating my review because this game is worthy of a lot of praise for due to the fact that it isn't just a game, it's a real submarine simulator. I have been looking for a submarine game that gave me the same thrill that I got with Silent Hunt when I was just 13 years old on my Nintendo. Now that game would probably never be able to hold my interest after playing this one. But everything that was right in that game was implemented here and now you have the realism of the beautiful graphics, crew management and submarine maintenance. There are rank ups available for captains and you can promote crew. To do the latter you have to spend reputation points that you earn throughout the course of missions based on what you accomplished there along with monetary rewards. One such example of earning reputation points and income comes when you rescue passengers of boats you sunk, and the rewards are increased when you take captains and other specialists on board. You spend your monetary rewards on supplies for your next missions and on ship upgrades which will require research prerequisites be met. You will need to assign officers to the HQ to perform these kinds of tasks. There are plenty of campaigns to choose from each with varying missions which will also have random added missions be presented. So that's kind of an overall summary of the game. From here I will outline some of the pros and cons that immediately stood out to me and I can tell you now, the pros far outweigh any cons that I may think of. 

PROS:

1. Submarine simulator with multiple tasks to keep you busy
   -Crew management
   -Supply management
2. Well balanced micromanaging system with options of depth to choose from at the beginning of the campaign
3. Stunning graphics. Throughout my missions I always take moments to slow the game down and enjoy the boat ride out on the deep blue, enjoy the sunsets and sunrises on the horizon and just take it in
4. Very well done sound effects drawing you into the atmosphere
5. RPG and story aspects that stay true to historical events
6. Historical war machines and missions
7. Multiple time controls
8. Challenging and engaging battles that require thought and strategizing, even the convoy hunts are not just some cherry picking fruit farm frenzy. You will easily turn from predator to prey if you aren't careful and even when you're careful
9. Excellent job with the time control options. You have real time to blast through the future
10. I haven't detected any serious bugs

Cons:
1. I can't think of any cons!

Final:
There is so much content here with plenty of refined edges since its inception that in my opinion they could drop this game as final today and it would be well worth its price with lots of replay value. Yet, they are still working on it which should tell you something about their passion and dedication to this project.",1635059233,1677816975,True,6,0,0.589337587356567383,2,True,False,True

Luckily with time and patches, a lot of the issues that plagued this game have gone away. It's very easy to find yourself slipping into a time sink with this game, plotting out your next mission and endeavor.

Plenty of fun and exciting content can happen in and out of the targeted play area. I stumbled upon a 30 ship warship fleet with an escort aircraft carrier well defended in the center. The thrill of finding the holes in the enemy's defenses and watching a salvo of torpedoes slam into the side of a ship never gets old and I'm glad this game is in a state that it can be fun and exciting to play.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-release Review 10May2019:
This game has way too many problems, far too many bugs, just overall way too many issues in general to consider picking up any time soon.

Plenty of game breaking bugs, like running out of food or oxygen while having plenty available.

Plenty of potential, but not in any state for actual gameplay.",1557523155,1677540533,True,0,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,True

Since the game is historically accurate, every single component of the sub, is basically true to its original form. U-boats were deadly for sure for both cargo, transport and military vessels at that time period. They even added the milk cow (Milchküh) namely the U-Tanker which is the resupply version of original U-boat designs. But if you are not a WW2 enjoyer, or you are not into that sort of settings, you'll eventually just get bored in such a short time like me. 

All in all, it's a well made game. Despite the publisher. I'm saying this because I've played an unwanted amount of PlayWay games that are all 'simulators' of something and it becomes quite repititive after a while. All the games look like cheapass clones of each other game etc. IDK. All seems like cash grab titles, I guess that sums it up...

Anyway, I've played UBOAT on hardest possible difficulty and campaing, so it was challenging and time consuming. Yet, i have enjoyed my time, listening old school radio, diving periscope depth to use hydrophone time to time to catch cavitation and calculating the target bearing, speed and distance to torp them. Actually I like the first person POV that reminds me some old but gold milsims like Dangerous Waters etc. 

Surely worth a play. Again, despite the PlayWay; so good job Deep Water Studio.",1677352566,1677352566,True,15,0,0.648242175579071045,0,True,False,True

Good:
Campaign mode that reminds me of the career mode in SH.
Character and crew can grow. So it has RPG elements. Sweet!

The interface is a bit wonky. It takes time to get used to commanding the ship. There should be more hotkeys.
The ship models' graphics could be better. Also, there is not a lot of variety between ship models. They need to add more.

Who's the UBOAT commander? This game is Risky Business because it's obviously not me.

That's too bad because I really started off liking this game, which brought back vibes of playing GATO in the mid-80s. There's no music to speak of but the graphics are nice. I was having a jolly good time until I got to the 3rd tutorial mission. I managed to sink the one cargo ship but I was supposed to deck gun down the second. And that's where the game just went haywire. I manned the deck gun and found it wouldn't turn at all. I couldn't see over the waves anyway but then the game went into extreme time rubber-banding. It was slow motion followed by ludicrous speed followed by slow motion followed by ludicrous speed again. Then the game outright crashed - all of this  on the 3rd tutorial. That's inexcusable and I should have known to avoid the game since its still hiding behind the EA moniker 4 years after release.

Now its a all different ball game !
First the graphics are amazing , in reality Sun set never was so beautiful in a game like this , I was an hard core Silent Hunter III player for years , even made a lot of Mods for it that are still around , but this game is just to cool ,not everything is perfect in its graphics , but with a graphic Mod here and there and you turn it into a great immersive game .  Its not a game Simulator for hard core Sub simulation players , but it is close , its focused on crew and boat management meanwhile you sink every enemy ship you can find on your periscope, than the fun starts , after a number of first missions you get the full learning curve and go deep into The skin of those U-boat WWII Captains, attacking task forces , merchant ships , or simply sneaking into a Merchant convoy and its escorts of destroyers, you can even take the Mission that Gunter Prien has done and sink the Royal Oak in Scapa Flow Harbor , what I dislike cause it cuts immersion since Prien was the Man that has done it those days ...

But above all the tension on your crew , when you are being hunt down by enemy Warships , the long sea travelings that take your mind away with their beauty , the Rough weather at Sea in the bad days or winter ...

I LOVE IT ....

I Advise anyone that liked Silent Hunter III  to try out this gem , it has been polished since its release , bugs cleaned out and now its close to its prime ...

It has 3 levels of difficulty  so of you try the easy mode you will get the taste of it and if you want to go and do those calculations and torpedo solutions and a more difficult enemy close to the real thing you can also have it...

Overall has it is the game is awesome and very entertaining ... Lots of Fun mixed with those moments you feel the end of your crew but than you manage to overcome it ..

It retains a bit of the dubious FPS interface from the Silent Hunter series but you can avoid it if you prefer. Both at the campaign level and the tactical one gameplay is varied, fun, and challenging. Does an outstanding job of providing detail and depth while minimizing the tedium inherent in naval warfare genre.

Scaling back the realism settings still makes for engaging battles where your decisions and planning count. You can turn up all the settings to as much detail as you could possibly want in weapon and crew management. This is not my preferred play style and there is a surprising amount of depth even at reduced settings.

Cons are negligible: some minor quirks in the interface and at-port management that could be improved a bit.

Hands down the best combat sim that's come out in years. This and Cold Waters are worth having if you're interested in the genre. (CW being the much stripped down and simplified version of the two, with a different historical setting ofc).

Take control of an U Boat at the start of World War II and struggle to survive as you combat Allied naval vessels and sink convoys meant to supply England and the Allied War Effort.

Your sub is able to be upgraded as is your crew. As you complete missions and time goes on, submarine technology advances as does the torpedoes.

(This is kind of a review in progress due to alpha and that i'm not exactly ""deep"" - no pun intended-  into the game (which i'll get into.))

[h1] First Impressions [/h1]
My first Impressions were, kind of a better version of Shelter, another game in the simulation/strategy genre, but instead of a fallout shelter and surviving a post apocalyptic wasteland i had the duty of helping a UBOAT full of eager (and not so eager) sailors ready for the trials and tribulations of war, i quickly did the tutorial and stumbled onto the sub. Overall aside from small UI opinions i liked it. Recruit some sailors, get a mission from HQ, and head out to sea. Easy enough right? I didn't complete a single mission for my first... 10 or 15 was in the bag and i was either dead, dying, or wishing i was. The game has some bugs and some aspects that just weren't so obvious. for example, trying to launch torpedoes at my first target and having them all explode on board (either it really happened or it was coincidence that i launched 4 torps and 4 explosions went off on board the sub) all the power on board went out after the first one so i couldn't really tell. Another time i had to force a restart was just sheer incompetence, not knowing i'd lose my ships location if there was no navigator i thought i had entered a non playable zone and ended up in a UBOAT limbo. The game read ""Full map not available"" which i immediately thought was the game telling me i had ventured into part of the full game, not available in the alpha. Or when i scuttled a friendly sub due to the crew being killed and to not let it fall into enemy hands all via the mission menus, only to be made an enemy of my allies and engaged on sight as i returned to port. There were plenty of hiccups like these, either bugs or lack of understanding/explaining but i was determined to give the game a real shot.

[h1] Pros	[/h1] 
[list]
    [*] Game is gorgeous in most settings, Ports are the least pretty of the entire game (only been to 2)
    [*] Realistic duties and functions (ex. need radio operator to send/receive messages or to report to HQ about any 
        updates)
    [*] Large map full world map, looks like it'll cover any of your WWII Sub fantasies
    [*] 1st Person and ""management view""
[/list]

[h1] Cons	[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Moderate-Low amount of bugs (better than most games but any bug is a con, sorry folks)
    [*] UI can become a bit busy (the control room for example has a lot of gear to interact with and it can sometimes be 
        hard to find exactly what you want to use, you get used to it and it's kind of a given with a submarine but i feel like 
        there's a cleaner more clear way to display it.)
    [*] Not often but rare occurrences of freezing when a lot is going on, like giving orders to all the officers at once, again 
        rare.
    [*] Map needs depth chart, too many times have i plotted a course only to hit seabed near the end during compressed 
        time mode and had to restart
    [*] bug that stops manual mode from being used (moderate encounter)
[/list]

[h1] Lasting Takeaways	[/h1]
I could go on all day about good and bad things about this game, long story short is it's right up my alley and if you like games with this kind of management/sim shtick then i'd go for it. Definitely use the tutorial and understand it's somewhat different than the Sandbox mode. I'll definitely be playing more, and i can easily see this becoming one of my more played games. It's not too easy and not too hard, but it can be a bummer spending 20 minutes getting everything right for one bombing run on me to kill multiple people and possibly put my ship out of commission, I'm not ashamed to admit i ended up on the bottom of the ocean a couple times... not on purpose. Overall i'd suggest this game, the cons i've listed are not enough to let this gem pass by. Just note this is a work in progress (which at this point in it's development is probably a good thing.) But Deep Water Studio seems like a team who wants feedback and gives all the avenues to hear it. I look forward to seeing where the development of this goes and how the team makes changes along the way. 

Sorry this is my [i] first [/i] [b] -poorly written- [/b] review but I truly do enjoy UBOAT and figured it deserved a thumbs up

[b] [u] Current Score 9/10 [/u] [/b] 
 I have no doubt that score will increase as development continues

EDIT*

This game has come a long way since this review was posted, many bugs have been fixed and today sits as one of the best WWII Submarine experiences on the steam store.

New score posted above, I'm going to leave this current review as is until i get around to writing up why it now deserves a 9/10.",1556776116,1674791639,True,29,0,0.713387191295623779,2,True,False,True

However, there are massive annoying features missing: 
- auto-save! i have lost so often 2 hours because I don't save all the time. 
- sometimes i seem to get attacked and I don't know by whom. yes, I do play mostly from the map but it is annoying that there is no alarm that the enemy is firing guns etc
- the fast travel should also work in combat. sometimes you just lie low and wait for the destroyers to leave. why do I have to wait 20 min for that? realism, yes, but boring like hell. 
- there are bugs that increase over time. if you play through all the missions at some point the game becomes so buggy that it is unplayable as you cannot submerge anymore etc.

I like Silent Hunter III more (from here on, I'll refer to it as SH III).  They're very much alike except for this one has a much more detailed / explorable inside of the sub.  SH III is quite a bit harder I think, but at this point I'm at the very beginning of the war when the threat level is not nearly as high as toward the end.

The navigation within the side view (it's a strange combination of 3D and 2D in that it doesn't strictly keep the same plane, rather wobbles/twists the plane while trying to stay there) is a bit finnicky.  It could use quite a bit of work and is far more aggravating than it should be - could use a smaller view where you can click the area to move the overall location along the sub of the side view, or at least have a better movement rate increase side to side.  SH III also took getting used to in that you had to remember the keys associated with different areas and you just pressed them to move between them.

I haven't fully gotten a feel for the AI priorities and how they work yet.  Still feels stilted.  I often find myself accidentally directing an officer to another required job when I have that one on a key job I want manned continuously.  This is especially annoying during torpedo attacks, but it could just be me being new to this game.  However, the shift system makes the management of personnel work better than SH III

The navigation system works well and doesn't need changes.  It's far easier to manage than SH III in that the boat will be automatically piloted even when leaving your base's harbor in order to follow the larger navigation plan and so far it doesn't seem like you have to worry about hitting the shoreline or beaching the boat, at least when exiting the starting harbor.  I bet that's not true everywhere though.

The periscope control is annoying, feels like you're dragging it side to side with the mouse / moves too slowly.  Gun control is too difficult to see how far the shot should go and feels pretty random so far during surface attacks on shipping.  On the more positive note, unlike SH III, you apparently can still man the guns in heavy weather, though I don't know yet if there are upper limits where it will keep you from doing so (probably, though it's definitely not as arbitrary as the other title, meaning I like it better for this).

The sonar listening device you start with makes it so you have to reverse direction to go around to the other side / doesn't let you go through the wash / area behind the engines for some reason.  I kind of doubt that is historically accurate and it seems annoying (it could be, I don't know).  I like how it works in Silent Hunter III better.  I currently have it so it shows ship icons you've detected on the map - it still feels a bit buggy in that detections just disappear randomly when you'd really still have an idea of where they are - so it doesn't have a good way of going from inaccuracy to disappearance.  Maybe I should just turn the icons off, don't know.

The guys take forever to get off the deck when you've ordered a crash dive.  I highly doubt they were anywhere close to that slow - if you have a plane with bombs coming, everybody would be moving down that ladder *fast* (so fast I bet they sustained injuries doing it from time to time).

Sometimes the AI guys get stuck on furniture and continue their ""walking"" animations.

Torpedoes need to be constantly taken out and ""maintained"" to keep up readiness.  I doubt this is accurate - either it has a mechanical issue or it doesn't.  Definitely could be wrong though (though, a torpedo losing almost 100% of its maintenance value, tending toward dud status in the course of an hour is quite ridiculous).  The overhead view on the map of torpedoes that are running through the water toward enemy ships could use work.  You can see them if you zoom in and out a bit as white wakes, but they're easy to miss.  If you consider that you'd have a pretty good idea where they were on the ship's map just from timing as well as watching wakes from the periscope, I don't think this is cheating at all (of course you're probably being stupid continuing to watch torps after firing, but I like doing it).

So far, my engagement experiences in the game have been fairly frequent air attacks while surfaced (charging batteries) and one sinking of a three tanker convoy at the eastern exit of the English channel.

Overall, it seems a bit more ""console-ly"" than SH III, more of a casual experience while also having a potential to have fewer of the more aggravating quarks like crew not auto rotating for rest and the like.",1673062622,1673076108,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,True

The performance though isn't great. I love the game but my laptop does not. Of which the specs are a GTX 1050, i5, 12gb memory and SSD. I have to have the graphics toned down for it to be playable. Higher end rigs i'm sure it's not an issue, but mine isn't exactly low end either, so take that into consideration. This system can handle games like War Thunder on its high end graphics settings. Which isn't as big in scale, but still pretty big and has far more assets on screen at any given time. Here, apart from your sub most of the time all there is to see is open ocean.

Can not escape or repair. When you loose a crew in critical situation it has snowball effect that you can not reverse situation. The game play is generally focused on getting intelligence, moving to interception point as close as possible, periscope depth and gather info before attack. Still even though you have 100 data its quite easy to miss and sometimes even torpedoes have some buggy strange behavior in launch.
General feeling of game play is awesome though, map is amazing I found the map usage quite intuitive nearly zooming fully to ship. Visuals and Audio design is very good.
Another annoying point was for me the escape key during going in and out map or first person. Maybe the escape button should be back rather than bringing the game menu all the time. Since the game is super mouse controlled having escape for game menu can be a bit too much.
There are some bugs and navigation finding sometimes your ship can just try to go from land so to avoid that right, hand steer %100 before open seas. General game design is problem right now even in fun mode (realism off). 
I suggest adding more user friendly buttons in fun mode on tab menu such as. Set Silent = gyro off crew mode blue etc for ease of access since it is too many going on for player while 2 vs 1 combat going on . Even in 1 on 1 with destroyer if you take damage its nearly impossible to go a certain depth, idle forward couple of km and escape.

Has future but game play not there yet.

F*ck this game..
Back to a solid RED Thumbs down!!!

NEW REVIEW: 26 Dec 2022
For the moment I'm going to keep this review short as I've only just started a new play through after uninstalling and re-downloading the game. I also purged the save folder of all previous game saves and removed several mods!

Since I re-installed U-Boat, and cleared all the possibly corrupt saves from my hdd as well as unsubscribing and removing any and all mods that hadn't been very, very recently updated, the game has been playing a whole lot better I've actually been able to enjoy playing again.

The only issue I still have is still with the annoying freezing when ever we sail into port, hopefully the devs will address this issue in any coming patches , but other than that I am happy to say I have changed my review from a red thumbs down to a blue thumbs up.


OLD REVIEW: ""I want to say yes go buy this game but seriously it is still a buggy mess why do devs insist on releasing games unfinished? It only loads first time about half the time i constantly get a synch with the cloud message that just sits there until i get pissed off and close it myself, the game stutters as it loads flashing everything from the desktop to the loading screen to the last thing i looked at online, by the time it loads the game i don't feel like playing because my hand hurts from punching the desk so many times!And then there's the freezes during play, sometimes at the worst possible time! Half the mods on workshop are now implemented into the game showing that as usual the community seem to be better at game development than the devs them selves.. Oh yeah and half the ports on the map aren't even working but it doesn't tel you this until you spend a ton of fuel and time sailing there only to be greeted with a message saying ""coming soon"" why this is not made obvious on the ports as soon as you mouse over is a mystery only the devs can answer!

I do like the game it has beautiful graphics, and the game mechanics are fun and realistic as a game can be i wouldn't go as far as to call it a sim though! so do i recommend it.. for the time being if you don't mind being frustrated every time you play then go for it, but if your looking for a finished and polished u-boat sim then no look else where.

EDIT: Now I'm getting CTD ffs are u kidding me, i just spent an hour and half sneaking up the coast to do spy mission and it just froze gave me an error box i've never seen before and ctd, the distance tool is no longer working through periscope only on map, and last night i was trying to sneak in and under a large convoy but it kept glitching and then suddenly i was in the middle of the convoy in full view and sound of a but load of corvets and warships so thanks for that.. This game has been out 3 years still in early release but isn't anywhere near finished or even half way working.. not a great way to spend.. sorry waste £25 I can't wait for Uboat Commander (unless it's by the same devs in which case it's a hard pass) 

If ur wondering why i keep playing it it's because steam suck sweaty ball and wouldn't refund me because i'd played a couple of minute over the 2 hours despite it being almost 3 hours before i'd got anywhere near an actual first go at playing it properly after 2 hours of youtube tutorials because there non existent in the game the ones that are there are the bare minimum, sail to a then to b, go in the store house buy some potatoes, and the attack tutorial is no better.. by the time i'd watched salted youtube vids and figured out how to sort out the crew and then finally set sail and found something to sink it gone way over  the 2 hours and i was no where near having a clue whether i liked the game or if it was a steaming pile of unfinished low budget bare basics of a *.....@ sub sim, in fact it's barely even a sim.""",1655653684,1672086084,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,2,True,False,True

Coming as someone with little to no experience playing the genre, and after a few dozen hours of trial and error, I can confidently say I'm addicted. Definitely bumpy though. The devs recently put out a major update that I really loved and added a lot of features that were missing, but honestly more than anything we need a performance update and an ai/bug fix update. Currently, I consider myself pretty seasoned (this review is fresh off of laying mines in portsmouth on hardcore) but the ai is definitely fucky. The destroyers are either useless and try and run away when you're spotted, or are the living reincarnation of Horatio Nelson, and will depth charge your Kraut ass into oblivion. The performance is also terrible. My pc can run Arma 3 at a consistent 45-60 fps, but is almost brought to its knees on this game's ""medium"" graphics quality lol.

With that said, this studio is definitely talented and behind all this there's a satisfying gameplay loop somewhere that's keeping me hooked. They say that the game is finally getting it's full release sometime early this coming year.

I find many modern naval sims to be too complex for my tastes but UBOAT strikes the perfect balance between historically-inspired simulation and roleplaying game elements. 

It's still dangerous to sail a boat and deadly to take on armed merchants and destroyers but with the right knowledge of period submarine warfare you will choose where and when you want to fight and sink hundreds of tons of Allied shipping for an imaginary German Reich while observing its glory rise and fade from 1939 to 1945. 

Community realism mods like UBE (U-Boat Expanded) provide a daily chronicle of ship movements and wartime developments while adding tens of thousands of historically-named ships and their true to life convoy routes, this and a slew of technical improvements provided by base game upgrades planned through 2023 will make this my submarine simulator for the decade. 

I have just a hundred hours in game, half stock half modded and I can say this game is a very relaxing yet satisfying application of your planning and management skills, interspersed with hectic coffee-fuelled frenzies to launch as many successful torpedo strikes as you can and using every technical trick in the book to reduce their (historical) unreliability and also keep your 6 officers and 18 men on a sardine can fed and alive throughout their harrowing 14 day Atlantic patrol. 

You can level up and customize the officers' skills, send the crew on vacation, and research upgrades for your boat while in port.

After wasting hours of my life to this monstrosity of a game, I compiled a list of what really pisses me off.

1. Crew members seemingly stand around, thumbs up their asses waiting for something to do. I don't know how to make them do anything without assigning them to an officer so that's no help.
2. Half the torpedoes I launch end up being duds.
3. There's no way to make the crew shut the f**k up when there's a destroyer chilling right above your sub pounding you with depth charges. 
4. The English Channel is 50m deep in the game (it's 172m in real life), making it impossible to dodge depth charges by submerging. So basically it's a submersible casket for the crew.
5. Takes more time to accurately aim the torpedoes than it takes Helen Keller to walk up the stairs.
6. IF YOU DIE YOU LOSE ALL YOUR PROGRESS UNLESS YOU SAVE BEFORE THE MISSION. There is no ""restart"" like I thought there would be, so I lost everything after playing for 3 hours. 
7. Useless intel from other U-boats. I don't care if there's a convoy that's 500km away from me. The sub is so damn slow they'd be on the other hemisphere by the time I made it to the designated grid.
8. Crew repairs are so slow it's infuriating.
9. HATCHES DON'T STOP WATER FLOW TO A COMPARTMENT. You can slam the hatches shut and order bilging, but water from the next compartment over will still find it's way in in mass volumes, making the bilging process completely useless. 
10. Only the radio operator can tend to the wounded. That makes absolutely zero sense. You're telling me the only one who can put a bandaid on someone is a radio operator??
11. Horrid radio stations that play a grand total of 3 different songs.
12. Torpedoes cost you money to arm sometimes even though you are an officer for the German government?? I guess they had to pay for their own torpedoes. 
13. People can't aim the deck guns for shit, would rather have Stephen Hawking in that chair than my smooth-brained officers. 

These are my grievances. I understand it's Early Access, but I can't imagine how these details were overlooked. Please don't buy this game. I'm begging you.",1671842004,1671842004,False,6,7,0.507604777812957764,0,True,False,True

That said, the simulation seems to me very realistic and immersive, the management of the crew innovative (also simulated the psychological part). There are 5 officers available, and 2 sailors can be assigned to help any officer to speed his work up, as long as the same sailors are available (the U-Boat was very small and have little crew members). 

In the tutorial I happened to have a sailor panic during a dive, and I instructed an officer to calm him down, otherwise his screams could have been picked up by the destroyer that was chasing us. As I said, it's an innovative thing. 

Moreover, the fact that you can impersonate the captain in first person and roam freely inside the submarine reminds me so much of the magnificent and ancient Silent Service 1 and 2, where we can assign our captain to every position ... Altough this game is very different from it, also here the captain can directly control any position, gun included, if you want.

Then, the variety paradigm: is chasing supply ship and evade destroyers and torpedo bombers with u-boats enough for a long enjoyment with the game? I will continue to play it, and keep the community informed with EDITS, if not.
Surely the fact that you can choose ever evolving different u-boats during the war years, works for mitigating this paradigm.

For now, about me, this is one of the best if not the best U-Boat simulator. And the sea effect is fantastic.",1671286686,1671286686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First off, the game is very casual, so try to save often and don't bum out if you get blown up.  You'll spend a while at sea, but they've added ""bonus events"" as you get to your destination, which really helps break the boredom. 

There's also a lot of method to how you get close to targets: really look carefully bottom right ""Visibility"" icon and see what you can do to avoid being noticed. The make it pretty cool as you fire your torp and watch it hit the target, then all the ships go crazy and search the sea to find you. If you get really frustrated, you can always just cheat and select target,  hit ` key, and type Break and watch the target magically blow up.




It's a fun game but got boring pretty quickly. I really like being able to go in the ship and watch the crew do their thing.  There's a few issues though: 
- The game map is unnecessarily large
- The enemy spawns really randomly
- Every time you get close to anything, you need to dive and limp away. You die often.

The good points, looks lovely, the sea feels like a sea rather than a platform or a chess board. The sub looks detailed (but it is not) and you can make it as hard or easy as you like, It is very technical, there is a storyline and A,B,C decisions to make in the way or action. But that's it.

The bad points, Controls are horrid, it is impossible in the heat of the moment to get the sailors to do what you want them to do. The sub looks really detailed however after playing barotrauma the options to repair the boat and the systems do not exist, which means if you are hit you are going down, i suppose that is realistic, but just annoying for me.

I really advise buying it.

I hope the devs continue to update it.
It has great potential. 
Please don’t stop the updates after the 1.0 release as many do. 1.0 is a starting point, not the arrival.
Even a couple of DLCs to support the development (if necessary and especially if not too pricey) could be nice (along with free updates).

I think the most lacking department is the variety of the missions, but they have worked on that and now they are improving. 
On this point, they could integrate better the admiralty missions (for example you could drop off the spy to the port when you do the reconnaissance mission to discover its defense) 

I am looking forwards to the addition of the new harbors with the next update (on this point work has to be done regarding the automatic docking procedure that is not working very well, even on already present harbors). 

Mines could be more widespread and their placement not just limited during some missions.

There are some bugs, but nothing too major. Once, while trying to dock my submarine literally took off (it happened only once). 
Moreover sometimes pathfinding is not working properly, especially when trying to intercept a ship/convoy.

Finally I really like the fact that you can customize the difficulty in order to shift from a more arcade game to a more sim one.

The coastal patrol rolls right over the top of me and does a tight circle around me, sure they are doing random circles, makes sense but I've done everything right so I still go undetected. Then 10 other coastal patrols roll up and circle on top of me for the next 7 hours straight.

Fleets are hard to find and when they are reported by allies, almost too far away to even try and find.  The upgrade system is also slow, low rewards.  Just too much simulation in my sub game.

An immersive experience showcasing what it was like to be a sailor in a U-Boat during the Second World War. Though your playthrough's realism is entirely dependent on the player, allowing anyone to have fun playing this game.

One thing that always blows me away about this game is the immaculate detail of the U-Boat itself. It's like a digital museum when you're walking through it. Just incredible.

Stalking and sinking vessels in fleets is never not satisfying, and trying to evade escort ships is always super stressful. This game can turn to horror if you let it (such is war).

With all that being said, this game is constantly being upgraded by the developers with evermore impressive updates and fixes. Though beware bugs are still present... early access game and all that.

Still, well worth it at it's full price if you're a military/history fan or sailor enthusiast.

With the new update 2022.1 out, it brings more challenges to your UBoat crew.  The new update increases the threat from allied escorts and planes, but also adds more perks to make your crew better.  

You can start from multiple points in the war, Starting to nearly the end.  As with real life of the Uboat crews, the beginning of the war was the, ""Happy Times"". However as the war progresses and technology advances it'll become increasingly dangerous to raid convoys.  Your tactics have to adapt as the Allies grow more dangerous, make sure to upgrade your boat when you can.

You can be the hardcore player and do everything by hand to figure our your torpedo course, or the casual player who lets the computer do all the hard stuff.  Either way you'll enjoy playing this game.  


I have encountered some bugs in the game that are annoying to deal with, like a ship that's basically sunk but the game claims it's not, another torpedo or a couple of deck gun rounds fixes the issue.  What I also don't like is that the tonnage war missions won't count tonnage sunk outside of your patrol area, meaning once the patrol is done the tonnage sunk won't count towards the world objective.  While it won't fail the game, it annoying to not complete the mission and get the crew perks.

It is almost impossible to save the boat after you get hit, it doesn't matter if its depth charges, fire from planes, boats or what have you. If you try to close the doors to prevent flooding in other compartments the sailors walk passed and open the doors and leave them open even if the compartment passed it is full of water. This makes it impossible to isolate sections of the boat causing more compartments to flood decreasing your buoyancy  until your resting on the bottom of the ocean awaiting death.

Edit (11/15/2022): You know I got to say, this game is amazing, the developers are really on top of this, after this latest update they actually fixed this entire issue I had. There is now a dedicated button you can press in the quick menu that issues a command that closes all the compartment doors, sailors can walk by and actually shut the doors behind them, nice thing about this is you don't have to shut down an entire compartment to achieve this. 

Now the game is very playable, the only improvement I'd like to see in the future is more missions and more ports throughout the world. I'd also like to see some more historical accuracy on harder game play modes. It would be amazing for things like power usage to be a little bit more accurate (I know, I know, its already really good), such as the lighting inside of the ship, that draws power, it should drain the batteries and use power, maybe the lights start to dim when the battery is low? Brighten when being charged? Environmental changes like temperature also play a role in your battery capacity, that should be a factor depending on what weather your in, a better capacity measurement for the capacity left would be cool as well, not just a percentage. would also be a lot more accurate for the weight of cargo to make a difference with speed, and fuel/battery millage.There has also been a long standing problem with the way items are kept on the boat, for some reason the amount of items you can keep on board is limited by the amount of slots you have and the amount you can stack, not the weight of these items, even though weight of cargo is displayed. Also I don't know if its just me, but it seems to be very hard to get air pumped into the ballast tanks, whenever you take on a little water and command someone to blow the tanks, even at low depth and full air tanks, it seems very slow or downright impossible to blow the tanks, you'll get a few percent of air into the tanks, but then it just stops, even with mostly full tanks, I'm talking 80%+ of air in the tanks and the game will just refuse to blow the tanks when your 100 meters under the water with a compartment flooded, and this is with a captain at the station commanding the tanks to blow.",1611280877,1668577156,True,0,1,0,1,True,False,True

 UBoat is Excellent! Die hard SubSimmer/Retired US Navy Fast Attack Sailor, and UBoat has my attention!! Overall immersion is very high, graphics are amazing. Im still early into the sim but Id say its really  an enjoyable simulation. A few ""suggestions"" to the DEV Team: Captains must have access to the boats speed-course-depth. Where is My Compass? (I got the MOD for this..its great!) Also, do the boats have a full crew? Why only 1 Radio/sonar guy? (Its an ""Officer"" thing..ok I have two now..much better) The Captain should have a sidearm, its realistic and standard equipment. Auto course plotting is OK but getting so close to land..bad idea, Dont I have a Chief Engineer to task sailors to charge the air banks?? (Got it now, just click and the sim has a sailor do it) Helmsman in the conning tower?? He should be in the Control room.)) Ok enough picking, great game so far, if your holding out, dont, buy this thing!  Over 60 hours into it and I dont know what a ""sand box"" is..who cares, its a GREAT sim. I spend more time sinking ships and evading escorts than managing my crew. Crew Management isnt that bad, and having someone loose their poo isnt totally unreal! The Inport setup is nice, adds to the ""lock and Load"" preps that make a good fight FUN. The Mod system is fantastic!! I can see this sim having some great replayability! I do hope the DEV Team considers doing this for the US Pacific Fleet Boats!!

After a 1000 hours they asked me to do a review. So,,,. I continue to be impressed and the latest build is EXCELLENT! The 1939 campaign is fun and increases the immersion factor X2! The AI continues to impress me, as well as the submarine damage Control Model, outstanding! I had hoped the dev team would have improved the crash dive time to something historical; 25-35 seconds, but it remains doggedly SLOW. The sub levels off @ 20 meters during a crash dive too??? Very strange. In Damage Control There needs to be a way to decide if something isnt fixed, to prioritize parts usage. Empty torpedo tubes for instance dont need fixing! Surface ships seem to be missing bow wake? Strange Omission. There are a few more issues fir historical simulation that should be addressed, but there is a lot of good, great and unique things that should be noted. The Ports are beautiful, the water is amazing and the sub interior is exceptional. Wreck diving is NOT historical, but it sure is fun, and useful especially when you find the GOLD..lol

Its fun(was), when it works. It has a LOT of bugs some game breaking at the moment like black screens and game just shutting down frequently. Sometimes it closes the game window but the game continues to play and I cant re-open the window. There are some other odd issues but I imagine those will get ironed out with later updates as they get closer to a full release. Those issues are more like the user interface and some weird game mechanics.
Gotta say the potential here is awesome but as is its frustrating to say the least to have to quick save every minute or risk losing the progress due to it shutting down or locking up.

9/6/20 - I am now getting a a bug that locks me into the periscope view but still able to walk around the ship and (semi) view the map.  The last 2 day I have gotten 3 game plays the lasted 20minutes or longer. The rest of the time is made up of 1-3 minutes quick saves and restarts.

I debated awhile on if i would give thumbs up or down, and due to the fact I have to start a new game every day/every few hours IRL, Imma say dont buy it rn, wait at least a few weeks until more work is done on it.

The game is great, buy it to support the developers, they seem to be very interactive with the community and I have VERY high hopes.

But there are many game breaking bugs. This is expected, but being able to save the game and continue it later In my opinion should be in the clear before you buy any game, even early access. The main issue with me, is after progressing to the point you can redeploy to another base, if you save in the area near that port, or Gibraltor, the save wont load. Before that happens, your frames will tank due to the massive amount of contacts and the game not being able to handle it yet. Many other people are experiencing this issue, and i hope it get resolved soon. AT THE MOMENT, you buy this game if you plan on starting a new game each time you play. I want to play the game, but im tired of starting a new game in it every day. once saves are fixed, ill recommend it. Do I regret my purchase? NO.

The game provides alot of options for new players to ease themselves into the more difficult and immersive gameplay options. Currently the game covers the entire span of WW2 on the European front and covers practically all of the western hemisphere including the Mediterranean and Arctic oceans. The game features campaigns and objectives that highlight different campaigns and phases of the German Kriegsmarine including Operation Drumbeat, the uboat raiding along the US coastline. Some of the misions can become repetitive over the years of the war but thankfully you can simply unlock freeroam to go and do whatever you want. The game also offers an unlock system to have extra officers or to unlock research and slowly improve the equipment on your Uboat. Overall the game offers hundreds of hours of content along with the options to finetune your immersion and gameplay, Highly recommended to WW2 fanatics and Das Boot fans.",1667155442,1667155442,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm really happy I did, the game in its current state is exactly what i want from a sub sim.
The mix between a more traditional submarine sim, and the micromanagement of the crew and the boat strikes a perfect balance for me, while hunting there is ofcourse a lot of wait that in other sub games can get a little bit frustrating, here however you always have something to do, that in the end will improve your chances of succeeding with the mission. It is as automated as you want for the most part, but if you want to squeeze that little extra performance from the crew then you have the opportunity to do so. The whole sandbox-like campaign, with port management, freedom of choice in regard to missions, free roaming, upgrades and perks makes this game really immersive.
In addition it looks really good and runs quite well on my rather old computer.

On a side note directed to the devs:
You have such a lovely naval sandbox setup, this engine and structure set in the age of sail would be a wet dream (no pun intended) for sure. The map is already there, the whole section cut, management aspect would be so satisfying with a 18th century ship of the line, the wolfpack feature where you meet up with allies and have the opportunity to take command over different ships also plays into it very well. The whole port structure with upgrades and trade, I could go on. It would be awesome.",1667141241,1667141241,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Best recommendation is that in 6 days since buying Ive racked up over 10 hours a day.

Ive played and written guides for various subsims. So glad I finally have a computer to run it. My 2 year old gaming laptop wasnt enough so it is a bit higher on needs but this is an older desktop just with a decent video card. 
Game has lots of sub-mission (pun) like taking care of wounded on other subs, capturing merchant captains from ships you sunk, divers to check wreckage and so forth.
Visuals pretty neat, crew management okay on the medium level with lots of it automated yet I still have to make useful choices to maintain the ship. One was to pull the radio man off the sonar in the middle of combat as they are the best medic for an injured crewman after a depth charge attack.

 Never was into Silent hunter series...buggy and a UBisoft mess I just am not interested...but back in the early days when Sierra Actually was decent publisher and Dynamix released Aces of the Deep I played that one quite a bit. Now some 27 years later we get UBOAT. 
 Yet not as feature rich really....Aces of the Deep offered 3 types of subs in career mode...Command: Aces of the Deep updated the graphics to a higher resolution. This re-release also integrated an expansion that brought in the Type XXI and Type XXIII U-boats  as well as the ability to enter the Mediterranean. Uboat has but one sub though many components can be upgraded....right down to the toilets.
 Unlike Aces of the deep UBOAT leans even more to Roleplay. You...the skipper hire officers and crew...all can be renamed and all earn XP as well as improved skills. As your reputation increases this allows research and upgrades and favors (such as sandbox). The missions are not dynamic but heavy scripted....which means easily exploited once you either figure out the tricks or look online for them. Sandbox is more dynamic as convoys and such are more random...though the game does have a lot of fixed convoy routes. Your campaign can freely go between the two....which is great as the more difficult scripted missions really need some research and upgrades before you tackle them.

 Being early access some things just aren't there yet. Some aspects in fact are downright obtuse. As an example if your sub takes damage your be notified that you need to do a more indepth inspection. Yet no command appears on your engineers to do this. After an internet search and hours of frustration I learned the command only presents itself if an alarm is active! This is just awful. Your in port and your engineers have all the time in the world but you can't have them do an inspection?! WTF! I have to raise an alarm and ""puff"" now I can magically give the command.

 Crew management also really isn't there and a lot makes no since. You have 16 crew...devided into 2 squads....my math says 8 crew each .....one day shift and one nightshift. yet 2 crew goes to 5 officers each...huh? that's 10 crew...leaving 5....or 2.5 on each shift...to do 10 tasks......uhhhh....must be new math. if I have 2 shifts...and 10 tasks to do each shift that means I need 20 sailors. If I have 5 officers that need 2 sailors each that's another 10 needed. Yet I can't have 30 sailors on the boat (historically it should be like 45 or 50). If you think it's a set and forget it thing you'd also be wrong. The system is supposed to take the higher numbers are priority....so all my officers have  thier highest number set to navigation...yet in practice I'm constantly getting lost because no one is on navigation.....and that drops fast...so your constantly 'manually' assigning them.

 Another issue is the GUI. Hitting tab brings up your officers for orders...but  the only ones listed here are the tasks you assigned in crew management. Other commands are found elsewhere.....and elsewhere can be anywhere. If an officer is manning a deck gun he won't attack anything until you command him to....is this command under the tab key where you give orders? Nah? tat would make too much sense...it's obscurly located in the upper left...but only if you have him selected...then you can choose ""shoot at ships"" or ""Shoot at planes"", A good GUI has all available commands in one place....be it right click or a list under their picture or something....other than anywhere ......

 The game uses Unity....yet performance can be all over the place for many people. My system is pretty good but it taxes both my GPU and CPU and my fans have to kick in to keep things cool.....I just do not understand this....even in early access. Unity has many built in tools for this...and the way you develop for Unity you can squash performance issues as you go...heck the profiler will pinpoint the code area the problem lies in.....there really is no reason this issue should ever be present. I know. I dev'd myself using Unity.

 Modding in Unity has always been hard for modders that do not have Unity...but many aspects of UBOAT can be changed via datasheets...in EXCEL format. If you don't have office there's plenty of free EXCEL apps that will let you open, change and save these datasheets...and the bulk of mods on Steam use this approach. Do note every update can break the mod...I'd say 3/4th's of the mods on steam are outdated and the mod authors have moved on and they don't work anymore,,,so if your searching mods don't look under most popular but rather most recent or last updated. these...for about 3 pages...should work.
  
 So all in all it has it's issues...but in the big picture the game is worth getting now and let's hope much of the above gets addressed. Overall you got great immersion, great RPG elements and management elements as well as a pretty good wargame experience. You can even play in 1st person though that isn't my cup of tea.

Enemy AI got polished... with that Sonar ping from the destroyer classes it gets pretty tricky to get away, if u cant dive to ground and sit there in silence. Good thing is, that friendly subs are almost everywhere around and they tend to support now. Was a nice new experience to have two Subs grounding an enemy Fleet. Wolfsrudel ftw :)

At all the Patch did the Job, but there are still some really annoying bugs:

- Sub hitting the ground even with a waterdepth of 8meters, just because the Timewarp is activated
- Subs getting critical waterbreaches out of the nothing (might be intented tho)
- Enemy Ship located by Hydro, start travelling supersonic over the entire Worldmap, even Land ofc

I like the game but I'm giving this a thumbs down until they fix one single thing.

Make saves from a previous version compatible with the next.

Every time a new version is released, with gameplay enhancements and bug fixes, you have to start over. 
Saves are explicitly stated to be incompatible with new versions - the game can't and won't load them.

It means you'll have to restart your campaign EVERY TIME a new version is released, or be stuck with an older version. In a game that takes so many hours to get anywhere, devs could put a little bit more effort into you being able to load saves from at least the previous version so you can resume your campaign. 

Saying it's in ""Early Access"" doesn't cut it. Factorio for example has been in early access for a decade and you might have been playing the same save ever since. The same is true for a lot of other 'early access' games.

So if you don't want to be back to La Rochelle buying torpedoes and potatoes and recruiting your crew all over every couple months, save yourself the hassle. It's a long, long way to Tipperary, so don't buy this just yet.",1605833625,1666816806,False,7,3,0.51040339469909668,0,True,False,True

Overall this game is some great fun, this is the game I did not know I needed to play right now! It was worth the SALE PRICE ONLY. There is one big but... as you play longer you notice the little problems stacking up: the biggest one I noticed was that even on the hard difficulty I almost never got sunk or even close to it. I could literally sail into a convoy with ease at periscope depth and destroy all the prized ships and run away unscathed, even with multiple aircraft and destroyers pursuing me. They would drop depth charges miles from me or try to shoot at me with guns and miss me every time. This definitely took the fear and excitement out of the game once I got used to the concepts. The only time I died is when I would accidentally crash into a ship or sail into shallow water and get stuck and take damage. It was too easy to outrun and hide from the Allied ships in the ocean. This makes sense in 1939 - 1940 when U-boats were OP but later on in the war it should be super hard. 
At first, the game is very fun as it has a lot to learn and some learning curves and tense moments, but the long-term playability is not there at the moment.

The game has massively improved in content and polish. Many minor issues are still present but those are very likely to get fixes before release. Just make sure you save your game often so you don't lose lots of progress for a silly reason like beaching your uboat due to bad port auto-navigation.

First of all, don't buy this now expecting to be able to play a lengthy sandbox campaign. This is hard due to save file issues, crashes, bugs that make your boat inoperable and also because of frequent patches incompatible with previous saves.
It's early access, after all.

But what we have here is a game with outstanding potential to become a classic of the subsim genre.

You control the officers of the famous U-96, and you can decide the level of direct control you have on the submarine, depending on your play style. For instance, when you have an enemy ship in sight you can just order one of the officers to calculate a torpedo course to the target, completely automating the process. Or, alternatively, you can enter the first person view of the officer, spot your target through the periscope, calculate range, speed and angle on bow manually (through a relatively simplified guided process, you won't be inserting raw values in the targeting computer), then fire your torpedoes.

The game can be played in both these styles, but it truly shines when played using the external view which gives you a clear interface for management of the submarine as a whole. 
This is the main strength of this game: you manage the sub and make the decisions, while the officers run the sub's devices and execute your orders. It allows for emergent stories to form on their own as you try and accomplish your objectives without getting destroyed. I'll tell you a story to help you understand.

In one of my missions I was tasked with infiltrating a British port and draw out their attention to create a diversion. I stealthily approached the harbour, on low engine power and with all unnecessary systems turned off to reduce noise to avoid detection. This took a while and the oxygen was starting to run out. I fire a few torpedoes on any vulnerable ship and start turning away, ready to escape. 

As the torpedoes explode, we get reports of coastal defence boats, armed with torpedoes of their own and machine guns heading towards us from the open sea. The only option is to surface the boat and sink them with the deck gun (which will also replenish the oxygen levels).

Surely enough, we scored hits on the boats, setting them ablaze. At this moment a dive bomber comes out of nowhere, heading straight towards us.
No time to spare, we must dive again. But it's too late, one of the bombs falls right on top of our torpedo room, which is now leaking water very quickly.
The boat starts sinking, which is good for hiding, but it will only make the flooding worse. I make the decision to evacuate the room, leaving in a few bedridden sailors that had previously contracted tubercolosis, left to die.

At least the bomber can't see us anymore, as we lay on the seabed at a depth of about 20m.
The two engineers equip themselves with underwater breathing gear, which allows them to execute repairs in the flooded compartment. Quickly they rush in, trying to let as little water as possible in the rest of the boat. After a few minutes the leaks are fixed.

As this is happening, discipline is very low and a few of my sailors start panicking, making unnecessary loud noise. I order my officers to knock them senseless, we don't have time to calm them down as our oxygen is almost finished and we risk being heard by enemy boats at any moment, making all this effort useless.

We turn on the pump to drain the water. Slowly, the remaining sailor use buckets to move the water to the central control room, where the pump works best. After 20 minutes we are finally able to regain control of our depth, and the cabin is dry.

We manage to slowly get away from the coastline without getting spotted, and finally escape and return to port. At the end of this we have 3 sailors drowned, another 2 arrested and unfit for service, and a battered, but still functional, U-96.

None of this was scripted or directed by the game. It happened, and it was quite epic to repair the boat at the bottom of the sea, with airplanes and boats circling around, hoping they had destroyed me for good.
And this mission was labelled as easy when it was given to me.

In short, this game is already quite awesome and will definitely get much better. Only buy it now if you are willing to put up with crashes, corrupted save files and the like.",1557242237,1666620793,True,2,0,0.528482913970947266,0,True,False,True

Commanding the submarine doesn’t end on maneuvering and firing torpedoes. Most of all the captain must actively participate in the lives of the crew, take care of crewmembers’ needs, assign tasks to them etc. Each sailor is a separate entity with a unique look, abilities and troubles; after some time he can stand against his superior. Each member of the crew reacts differently to captain’s actions. The player must maintain discipline on the deck, but being too harsh might end in deterioration of the mental state of the crew. This might for example lead to fights inside the crew or to someone becoming a spy. In addition to that, the player must take care of physical needs of the crew – provide food and make sure men can rest. Welfare of the crew has a direct impact on their will to fight, which is the basic attribute.

While the main part of the game takes place on the deck of the submarine, one shouldn’t forget that [b][i]UBOOT[/i][/b] is a sandbox game and the player can decide where to go. The freedom given to the player is noticeable also in crew management.

[b][i]UBOOT[/i][/b] is a three-dimensional game, but the crew management looks similar to Fallout Shelter – the camera usually shows the ship from a side perspective. The submarine was very precisely modeled and during the game one can look at various details like tank ballast, compressors etc.

- Options for realism and micro-management

I really enjoy the atmosphere of the submarine. The boat is modelled beautifully, It is honestly so refreshing to see a subsim game but with graphics like this. The missions are creative and suspenseful too.

Unfortunately it still feels a little rough around the edges in places. Sound design of the Deck Gun and MG in particular is still very bad, and the animations are poor when it comes to these weapons as well. Sound design is really good when it comes to other things such as the engine rooms or the weather.

Damage models for enemy shipping are also lacking. Enemy shipping also sinks WAY too fast when it's health is depleted. The boat will literally go down in about 10-20 seconds, which barely gives you time to process your success. Damage to your own submarine however, is modelled very well which I think deserves a lot of praise.

There is another small but annoying issue for me as well. The combat music will begin to play immediately as you are detected, even if you're crawling along at a depth of 100 metres or more. This breaks the immersion quite a lot as it really kills the mood of sneaking into convoys. It doesn't make sense for you to immediately know when you've been detected via things like hydrophones or aircraft. Combat music should probably only play after the first explosion of a depth charge or shell that is targeting you. On a positive note, the soundtrack for this game is very atmospheric and I love listening to it. I wish i didn't have to turn it off to avoid this other issue.

Would still recommend this game. Hoping these things I have mentioned are improved.",1666349618,1666349618,True,3,0,0.569536387920379639,0,True,False,True

U-Boat is a very cool game.   This game also has a lot of bugs to work out.  In its current state, it is playable, and quite fun, but there are a lot of pretty basic, almost laughable issues that need to be fixed.  

It's a really ambitious product though, and if the developers can follow through and build upon the cool design they've created so far, this could be better than Silent Hunter 3, which is still probably the gold standard for Atlantic WWII warfare.   

I'm excited.  I've seen a lot of products that promised to be better than SH3, but this game has the same feel and much better graphics.  If they can keep the realism, fix the bugs and not squash the fun out of it... this game could have serious legs.  Good luck.

Update, May 24th 2019.  I really can't over state how good these graphics really are.  They have really captured the look and feel of the ocean, and the U-Boats, in all kinds of different lighting and weather conditions.  Already a number of game breaking bugs have been fixed, although there's still a long ways to go.  The missions system is kind of an issue now.  Simply patrolling your area for a specific distance ends your mission, even though you may have a full load of torpedoes left.  Kind of strange.  Crash diving, torpedo depth settings, varieties of ships encountered, and aircraft... all have a long way to go, but it is making progress.  The realism though, for the limited scope of the project so far, is astounding.

Update, February 2nd, 2020. This game has seen many improvements, and in its current state is arguably one of the better WWII sub sims. There are still some balancing issues. Being able to see all the escorts on your map makes it possible to avoid their depth charge runs pretty easily. That will probably be nerfed in the near future. There are still only a few types of ships, and only one type of sub hunting aircraft in the game.

There is still just the tyype VII type submarine playable sub, and I would be surprised if any other types of playable subs were introduced before release. Perhaps DLC?

Regardless, the graphics, officer actions, and realism has just improved. Also, the number and quality of mods have really made this game much more fun.

Update, October 18th, 2022. Again a slew of updates have turned this game from an arcade offbeat product into a serious sim. The last update pretty much addressed every issue I still had about the game. It's been a pretty slow development, but as far as U-Boat sims go, this one is going to be pretty tough to beat. There's still some things I would do different. The method to ""research"" and get upgrades, sometimes ridiculously early, is still kind of broken. And the crew compliment isn't nearly like a real Type VII sub, in that they carried 45-55 crew men, depending on the model. Also, the method to identify and compute firing angles is a little weird, in that you measure the speed of the ship without first identifying the angle and distance from your boat, but whatever.

( Would like to sea some sea pardon the pun making the sea bed come alive with plant life and rocks  kinda like in gta v but not as much...  something at least )  

That's not to say your alone...

Sometimes you have one target but why not let the escorts sail home alone SINK EM ALL... 

The skill tree for the main officers is ok little on the light side but works out well with getting buffs on things like helping crew moral and targeting enemy ships... subs upgrades are great with researching parts by sending corresponding offices on missions from battery's to AA turrets, radio equipment to toilets... all to help your crew and boat complete the mission... 

A lot of other players discus about how Uboat compare to SH 3,4,5 and from what i mostly read is. In true ubisoft fashion they are all a buggy mess and need to be heavily modded to be any good.. Uboat has its bugs but i believe that the devs are trying their best to fix them and there seems to be a talented modding community behind Uboat creating all sorts of changes reskins of camo, flags to remaking targeting systems to make the game more realistic.. I find the game to be awesome without mods but they  only enhance what was already a great game... 

Top tips 
#1 save all the time before engagements before boarding other ships ( bugs )
#2 watch lite ly salted you tube videos if your new to sub sim games 

To be honest this game is worth full price and highly suggest buying

Upon it's release though I decided to wait awhile, as at that stage all reports advised the game was very gltchy and poorly optimised. So, it was 12 months later - April 2020 before finally added it to my Steam library.  First impressions there were that it was still pretty glitchy to say the least and prone to errors, the control scheme was a bit of a nightmare to use. Overall, it looked like it would require a massive amount of time, work, debugging and further development to be anywhere near what the developers envisaged. 

    Even with all this going against it you couldn't help but feel there was something here of a value, and different from a what has ever been seen before. Days turned into Months with various small fixes and odd update but it all seemed one step forwards, two steps back again. Then the game started appearing in every sale and offered now and then at a cut price cost. At this stage it would be easy to think 'Oh no, the Death throws of yet another Early Access title' that will never really ever be finished but will be milked to pull in anybody who happened upon the offer page. Yet another Submarine simulation that will be ever fated to have numerous mods with the promise of restoring parts of the game that should of been.  But Amazingly for once no !!!

      The transformation and the development path of Uboat has been nothing but amazing. With this latest update 2022:1 anyone buying the game at this point can be confident in buying a really competent, atmospheric submarine management simulation. Heavily influenced by the classic German TV series and film Das Boot, if you have seen it in the film, it most likely will be featured somewhere within this title.  The Graphics, reflections and textures are simply fantastic, if not the best I have seen in any Uboat simulation. Add into this the ability to switch into 1st person mode and navigate your way throughout, squeezing past the crew in the confines along with an equally refined sound palette, and it can all seem scarily real at times.
      The major difference with this game compared to say the Silent Hunter series and specifically Silent Hunter 5 which up until now was THE title for the WW2 Submarine Captain / Roleplay simulation, is you don't feel like you are given a boat then abandoned to fight the war alone with a bunch of NPC's. In Uboat you get a selection of varied missions and tasks, along with regular contact from BdU advising you of such tasks or emergencies such as rendering assistance to a fellow Uboat crew that has received damage following a depth charge attack. Area wise you are only limited by your stores and fuel supply with replenishment options available in friendly ports and even at sea. You can even sail your crew within the enemy ports to cause chaos where they'd least expect it.  Through your career you manage your crew, their shift patterns and jobs. Through experience / reputation you gain ability points to level up their skills increasing the effectiveness of your Boat. You can hire crew to replace losses, and even dismiss members of your crew who you feel unfit for further duties. The game has a lot of customisation to make each crew member unique and not copy paste of one another. Same with the Officers and their dedicated tasks, further special abilities can be learnt. You can send Officers on missions to help develop upgrades for the boat and better weapons / defences.  It's that indepth, OR you can tick the options to remove as much of the management side as you wish and just concentrate on the story side and hopefully being one of the few that survived the war in the Uboat Service. 
       One of the major issue I had with the game at launch was the controlscheme and the U.I - this has now been improved greatly with options to redefine keys and control types. Also by holding certain keys tasks can be issued, queued quite quickly although I can sometimes still have difficulty / errors doing so, whether that is on my side or the games ? couldn't honestly say.  There are minor annoyances like the crew member who feels the need to shout 'Faster, faster' every time a speed change is entered. The guy who won't get off the periscope and feels the need for a nosy even with a large amount of the USN, Canadian and Royal Navies circling above.  The Title has been heavily supported by the modders so quite possible these issues can be mitigated.

       In summary, if you have any interest at all in management games it is well worth buying. If you have any interest in Naval and Submarine titles, you most likely already own the game. In the unlikely event you don't though - can absolutely, without any hesitation recommend getting this game. The sheer amount the dev's have packed into this simulation, along with the dedication just pours out from every aspect. As said way back in the beginning, at one point it appeared they would never get it to work right, with numerous issues and difficulties and many other titles i've seen on Steam have been abandoned at this stage with the Dev's shirking off, disbanding and going on to the next project.   Not here though, they've stuck it out through what must of been difficult times and produced something really spectacular, that didn't come easy. Perhaps that is why we now have such an excellent simulation today, purely for the reason it wasn't quick and easy and required real heart, blood and tears to reach this stage. If you don't feel that is worth supporting, well, what is ?
10/10 for sure

The core idea of having a crew to handle and morale beside the boat is great... but it lacks so much. It feels like a tech demo you would send to financiers. I wont even mention bugs, you know, it's still early access, so.

My last hope is looking forward to the full release (that should have been last year according to their roadmap) so the modding community comes to the rescue an make it rich and enjoyable like they did with so many titles.

And calling this game realistic is comparing bomber crew to IL-2. Yes, there are realistic mechanics in it but there is absolutely no randomness like real life has or historical accuracy in it, so there is no feeling of ""real"" in it. 

Sorry devs, I wish I could recommend this game so you could get more money to develop it to a full game, but i recommended it to all my friends and everyone bought it on ea release and nobody plays it anymore after like 10 to 15 annoying ingame hours, so basically it was a waste of money for them. I am the only one who still has hope...

EDIT: After hearing around in the forums i got optimistic. The devs are working close with the community and there are mechanics in the game that are actually inactive right now. I think this game will become great, it still isn't, but it will be if all comes true I heard and read.
Hopefully I can change my feedback to recommended soon

EDIT EDIT: After 3 years not much changed, progression of the updates is awful, still no full release in sight, the most nessessary things like TDC still missing in the game.

The game contains a lot of bugs i found that it was not noticable in the first hour but in prolonged gameplay you begin to see them minor one which just breaks immersion is water washing over the port like there is some kind of flood. A more game breaking bug is the submarine just starting and stoping with engines to full and max battery and half a tank of diesel. A game breaking bug i found was the submarine going to the point i specified then doing a 180 (On its axis not turning like when giving a new heading) and refusing to go to the point, spam clicking solved it most of the time but this is really annoying. 

I also noticed that enemy ships do not spawn unless you go to a slower fast forward mode I had this at the opening underneath spain that there was no enemy ship i slowed down the fast forwarding and then 20 ships spawned arround me. The crew management aspect is tidious because the crew just likes to do the task for a bit and then go to sleep which is fine but then no one takes the post this is a problem for navigation, targeting, searching for enemy ships. I have had it happen in combat which was not that fun. 

It is nice to see upgrades and a research tree for the submarine giving it a bit of custimisation. There hasn't been a update in 10 months and they just announced the 2022.1 update which is fine I did find it weird that streamers get early acces to a update. 

I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state as it is fun for a bit but then annoys you with its mechanics. like i said the last bug fix was 10 months ago and they announced a new major update, I hope the bugs I mentioned are fixed in that version but there is a high chance there will be more bugs with the update considering new things always leads to new bugs.",1665264704,1665264704,False,22,2,0.543056368827819824,0,True,False,True

Uboat is a really good game, does it compare to SH3? imo no it doesnt.

I’m not the biggest WW2 historian but I do enjoy the overall scene a bit; which leaves me wondering if the mechanics are enough to keep me engaged.  Let’s Discuss!

The way Grandfather Played:  This game is amazing with the level of detail it provides.  Although well beyond my capabilities (or desire) my understanding is that you can go as far to play this game in first person only as near as possible just like you were commanding a real uboat.  No shortcuts, you even have to calculate speed and trajectories the way it was done in the 40s.  Now this is well beyond what I’d enjoy aside from doing it once or twice so it is a great thing that developers created a more simulation mode where you manage your crew more and realism is cut down a bit.

I’m the Captain Now:  I absolutely love management games; I especially love crew management games. Add in some tense moments and this lone predator vibe and this game definitely scratches an itch.  Setting up shift rotations, ensuring the crew is fed and low stressed.  This is more what I enjoy and the developer did a great job here too.  There are obviously some areas that are still being worked on but the core gameplay is here.  Although it does feel a bit more like an ‘easy’ mode and less of a management mode but I’m okay with that.  The game allows you to play two very different games and even mix between the two as you choose.

John died of Dysentery:  Most of the issues I have with this game are in two categories; things I don’t like but understand it’s not for me and small things that I’m confident that will be fixed.  I would like to see a larger variety of missions and more side missions added mid mission.  I would like to see more commands added on the tab menu (station keeping for example).  There are some minor graphical errors that I’m sure will be ironed out in time as well.  For example, smoke funnels appearing right next to my ship.  One thing this game definitely needs is more exhaustive level of tutorials.  Attacking convoys for example is a very difficult and daunting and the AI just seems to immediately swarm you and would like to see some in game tutorials on how to address these things better.  Speaking of that; the warship AI doesn’t seem to function well, maybe I’m misunderstanding naval military tactics but having all the destroyers for a convoy break and engage a possible uboat sighting seems off as they just exposed their other flanks to a second uboat.

Overall, this is a great game; everything seems to be getting smoothed out and new features are still being added.  Although the hardcore realistic settings are definitely not for me I really enjoyed the simulation of managing a UBoat crew.  Especially for the price I highly recommend this.  Enjoy!

The combination of micromanaging the crew with realism of a sub simulation game is superb, never made the game dull or boring and keeps it constantly interesting.

get it on a sale or wait.

ok...I feel the first lines do not fully reflect my experiences so far, so here are (some) more details of my resume after some 160+ hours:

- still too little ship/plane models in the game and the world itself feels empty and lifeless 

- loading times increase with length of play time / campaign progress while the game play itself gets clunkier and more prone to lags

- crew members get stuck 

- during blue light my mechanic started heating up the torpedoes

- ships literally spawning out of thin air and falling from the sky. sometimes gracefully - sometimes not 

- time compression is a delicate mistress, especially in close proximity to solid objects e.g. quay walls, sunken ship wrecks or the H2O atoms around your boat

- which may lead to:
  a) crew members get injured out of nowhere and die, because you're not able to treat therm
  b) your boat getting randomly damaged 
 
- I cannot fathom the lackluster voice acting

- crew development is meh at best and not very rewarding as well as research itself, too

- cowards get tossed out of the crew and heart attacks(!) no medical attention as there is no other cure

- suspenders go above the shirt and beneath the jacket. no wonder that Germany lost the war...

- apart from sudden crashes, which got less frequent since 2020, I admit, save games sometimes break too for no apparent reason

- still no crash collision for airplanes which, after being shot down, drop totally unscathed into the sea and continue bouncing on the surface

- masts break, ships catch fire and fronts DO fall off but still no sign of damage after putting some 20+ 8.8 AP shells into that sob freighter

- I have encountered not one aircraft carrier so far 

- friendly ships can be given a random course by selecting them while being in vicinity 

- the interface or the way the boat or the crew have to be commanded can be very special at times up to being counter intuitive and clunky 

- and again time compression in (close) vicinity of ships/objects is a choreful delight

- silent running ... schmilent running

- beautiful interior design of a Type VIIc boat which is futile as most of the game is played top down on the map

- the game is fun but soon gets repetitive, as missions are generic and don't vary that much
...whiiiich would be fine as being an u-boat skippers main task would be that of driving around in an u-boat and sinking ships left and right whenever possible if only the immersion would  be a biz more than that of a sandbox experience

EDIT:
after a few more hours in i can say that nothing really improved to change my initial prognosis.
the game runs unstable as hell, especially when i try bear island or scappa flow missions. i'm barely able to complete two missions in a row before another crash occurs even if i do standard missions and run the game with no mods at all. actually the stability decreased over the last year which is quite an accomplishment.

crew management is still a total bust, which is most annoying and even adding new shifts or naming them does break. crew tasks still lack enough diversity like being able to assign a sailor to the radio but not to the listening post or the navigation map.  

from my last try until today the devs made the game worse by focusing on the wrong features. i'll give a f..k about graphical adjustments like submarine bunkers if the game constantly crashes or the mechanics do not work.

at least ships stopped falling out of the sky which was a really funny feature but they still did not finish the suspenders. 

dear devs, 
keep on repair bugging your game but as of right now i cannot recommend your game to anyone and seriously doubt that you'll ever complete it as basic game features still do not work like 2+ years ago.",1622440315,1663557723,False,3,1,0.540611863136291504,0,True,False,True

The gameply Uboat reminds me most of, perhaps a bit weirdly, is the Microprose B-17 games. Crew management with manual intervention if you want it. 

The interface took me some getting used to (I don't have great eyes and had to find a way to get along with it) luckily the command and worklfow is quite flexible. 

Where UBoat really excels is in the storytelling. In most WW2 sub sims, the patrol is its own story, but it's doubly so here. All the little things you want out of the experience are there; lifeboats, radio intercepts, boarding ships, taking on survivors from lifeboats (or not, up to you!). Walking around the boat in 3D with the blue lighting while a destroyer circles overhead...you're remaking Das Boot on your computer. 

The tech tree is well thought out, by default you get just the right amount of help. The tutorial will get you there but it's a bit thin, you sort of have to work out your preferred way of moving crew about and deaiing with problems. You can do it in the 3D world, or use the menu-driven abstraction (which I honestly prefer). 

The first time you get really clobbered by an escort and you see the compartments filling up with water and the lights going out you're glad it's just a game - but what a game.

The 4th patrol tutorial mission kept bugging out. One time I couldn't mark a course. I reloaded and at the point you were supposed to get your radio man to give medical assistance he did nothing. I replayed from my last save 4 times. This completely stops you from making progress because the treat the crew member prompt won't go away and allow you to do anything else. The light change icon also disappeared, I couldn't change the lighting. So I decided to skip the tutorial and try a regular mission. The game froze switching from map view to sub view. Pretty much all of the 11 hours I have into this game I was fighting bugs. In 11 hours I've basically made zero progress. I do find this simulation interesting and I think they have a lot going for them, but at this point it's not worth trying to play.

This game tries to be way realistic while having completely retarded AI wandering around your submarine that you will need to constantly babysit. The tasks come down to just travelling to a place and then having to fight the god awful combat mechanics. Having said about combat mechanics, the game gives you a bunch of tools that you will need in order to aim at the target and set the right parameters for the torpedo, now every time I set the parameters all I get is torpedoes going all over the place and nowhere near the enemies.

other notes:
only things that annoy me me are the UI is pretty bad (although i usually dont pay attention to it) and specific missions have bugs/ships behaving really oddly. ultimately if you like submarines and more slow/tactical games i highly recommend.

also go get the TDC mod, cant play without it

Uboat first and foremost is a management sim. your job is to manage the day to day of the boat so you can stay combat effective. from upgrades and resupply dealing with crew panic that is the main focus of the game and honestly I found it very enjoyable. The game looks pretty great and doesn't really stutter, at least on my 6 year old gaming rig, and the AI, much like the British during the war, get better with time at trying to sink you.

a few cons of the game are as follows, the longer your current play-through lasts the more bugs you will notice. and it can affect everything from merchant ship health to, most frequently, the crew bugging out. Also currently some parts of the game just are not fleshed out, for instance I have found the Mediterranean to be the most boring place to be, though that should not be the case. I'd say this is excusable, being a game in early access. 

while the updates are spaced out I'd say that the devs are actively involved with the community, most of their updates hit the unstable branch, which anyone can join. But dont expect the main gameplay loop to change, they are close to being finished so dont expect to many major gameplay updates.",1660143557,1660143557,True,12,0,0.643876016139984131,0,True,False,True

I know the WW2 subsims I already have and love are rough and getting dated, leaving plenty of room for a worthy successor.

But that's the thing... this just isn't it. This game manages to feel a lot clunkier despite running smoothly on a modern version of widescreen windows. But past that it is simply more tedious. You need to even install a TDC mod to make shooting a torpedo an even slightly reasonable ordeal. 

And while all of the crew mechanics could add to the tenseness and drama of the game, instead it leaves me frustrated. Sure it looks nicer, and seeing all the crew going on with their lives is lovely to see. But every time you dive the men go to the bow torpedo room and all just clip into each other with the most empty expressions you could imagine. Then they mess around with the beds, and god forbid it is time to maintain the torpedo. Everything just pops around then. Beds dissapear instead of being put away. Where do the torpedoes even come from? at best there's 4 in the tubes. The others just magically appear.

I can go on with this nitpicking, but if the things that this game should have over the older sims are rough and barely immersive it should be noted.

The water is lovely and the motion of the boat while on the surface brings back memories. As a submarine simulator, I think it compares favorably with the Silent Hunter series. With some polish, it could be one of the greats in the genre.
I do have suggestions that I hope the developer reads...
In addition to polishing up crew management and other things mentioned in other reviews, I'd like to see some historical context given for the boarding ships and rescuing sailors from lifeboats part of the game. Specifically, I'd like to see something in the start about War Order #154 (""do not rescue"") and the Naval Protocol. I think it adds some life to the game and gives the player room to decide whether to be gentlemanly in his duty or go full asshole.
Related to crew management, one thing I really must insist needs to be fixed is the method for using the pill thrower. The decoys need to be stored right next to it and there needs to be a button or something to order decoy launch.

You can probably get up to 50hours out of the game, but that is about it. Do not expect more.

Manually doing the targeting is only fun for like a few missions, after that it is a chore and you just let the ai do it.
Meaning the game just gets very arcady unless you want to suffer in boredom, which to be fair probably was the life of a submariner.

But man, oh man, are the controls bad. It's if It's as if the game designers took the melted mess left over from the fire in the Apollo 1 capsule and implemented what was left in this game.
- Rudder/Speed controls. They're small, unobtrusive. Give me the option of sticky'ing them on the screen. I NEED them all the fucking time.
- What's with the first/third person hot garbage? Jumping between them is confusing. 
- Heaven-forbid you try to bring up the hot-menu to give them a quick-command and hit the right-click mouse command LIKE IN EVERY OTHER OS OR GAME THAT PEOPLE HAVE EVER USED IN THEIR MODERN LIVES and it changes the course of the boat. Every. Goddamn. Time?
- How about the fact I just can't give (or at least with no help or tutorial I can't figure out how to give) global commands like: 'Silent Running' or 'Rig from Silent Running'?
- Why oh why do the sailors stand around doing absolutely fucking nothing so much? Even when I try to make them do something????
- Why do torpedoes never rearm? There's probably some weird staffing bullshit (I'm playing on Normal BTW) that I'm missing. But my crew stands around watching leaks and admiring the all the empty cavity space left by my fired torpedoes. 
- Why is it so fucking frustrating to get back targeting information? Why isn't it a hot-key (Bring up ALL visible/heard ships in a list and right-click to perform action? Why all this cumbersome bullshit? It's NOT people management, that's the thing. It's simply hard to get things done.
- Inconsistency in the UI is everywhere. Navigating in one level (F1 vs. Map) differs. Some keys are re-assignable, some aren't (like fucking turning off right-cllick-fucking-heading-select). Or the best example: The time skip. One second it's along the bottom center of the screen, next, it's in the top-left, next it's not even visible and you have to go back and forth clicking crappy icons till you find it!!

I can't recommend it. And I really want to. I explain why. I really wish there was an in between yes and no or a points system for rating games.

First of all, I rarely write reviews. I have a ton of games on Steam and a lot I don't play. But I write a review when I am really into a game and its not QUITE there. And this one isn't.

First things first. Graphically this game is amazing. The level of detail is astounding. A lot of thought has been put into this and also the gameplay aspect. The gamplay aspect can get a bit repetitive but then, war is large parts of boredom interspersed with intense moments. Its a really great game to look at and to play but it has a major major flaw which makes me want to punch the screen in anger.

And that is crew management. Its ridiculous. Its absolutely absurd in my opinion. Why? The crew seem like rabbits that just seem to do whatever they want. Alarm, action stations? Some people will still be lying in their bunks. Just fired 4 torpedoes in the middle of a convoy - would make sense for the crew to automatically reload, right? Nope. During a torpedo attack, if the skipper isn't on shift then he will stay in bed (as sleeping) but the screen will show that he is still giving orders. Its the AI part of the crew management that is just so damned frustrating.

But then lets focus on the really frustrating but potentially the most exciting part. Coming under attack and dealing with crisis management. A fair few times my boat has been depth charged and sat on the bottom of the sea for a great deal of time. For those fans of the movie Das Boot, I thought this was where the game would become exciting. Ah, no. Send a crew into a slightly flooded area and they will drown - even when they have rebreathers. Well, the rebreathers are in the lockers but did you tell them to take them? Ah, silly U boat commander. Heaven forbid, the stern of my boat was flooded but in the storage locker I had at the front I had a diving suit. SURELY I could send my guy suited up into a flooded area and he could repair everything, right? WRONG. He died. EIther the crew will go willingly to go and fix something and drown in the process OR they will just stand in one of the comparmtents and just shake and be scared. Want to salvage parts from scrap metal to try and fix stuff? Well, you need a salvager. So if one of your remaining 15 crew don't have that perk. SOrry guys, you all die. Don't even bother trying.

And this is where the game differs from other sub type games but just can't deliver. Crew management is an excellent part of this game but HOW it operate is just lacklustre. Oh, and one spare part that can repair a pump is also used up to replace a light bulb? How about more integration with other parts. Can I not strip something out to fix another? A bit of underweather ""scrapheap challenge"" figuring out what I do and don't need to get my U boat back in the game, albeit limited. 

For me, this is what SHOULD make the game complete but its just lame in its current form in my opinion. And I say that because this game has sooooo much potential to be better. Not just a U boat sim but a crew management and problem solving sim. 

In its current format, I can't recommend it as opposed to other subsim games but if its in its best format it will wipe the floor with the SH competition graphically, game play wise and depth of detail.",1657798278,1657798278,False,3,0,0.545600175857543945,0,True,False,True

OK lets say you want to upgrade your uboat,what can i do? ok you got the Headquarters and put your crew members in some Research for some tec.the Problem is you dont have them on your boat,what mean if you dont have any crew member who can read the map you dont need to go out the bay,you cant buy or get replacments so easly you need to buy them and if you dont have enough point to upgrade or buy new crew members you are fucked.The development of a tec take his time for exempel  some fancy Torpedo need 43 days to get ready, so you dont have your captain or what ever till the 43 days are over ,and beleve me 43 days are much in this game.

So, they get on their little raft (which seems to be invisible with my crewmen?) they did their investigation, but... on the way back, they reappeared, but there stuck in mid air or deep in the ocean? I also experienced an engineer rapidly changing between the engines, and resting non stop. The 2 crewmen I had assigned to aid, were also stuck in the same loop. They didn't know what to do. Without rest, they don't perform there duties. So I lost 3 men, and I had to rely on my other engineer, only being able to work half the day.  Earlier that day, I past an allied sub on the way to a patrol, doing 360s near port......Spare crewmen. Well, you can adjust and assign menial tasks. Great you think? But for some reason, they refuse to follow any set tasks about 20% of the time (even though their jobs are set 100% correctly). Destroyers and aircraft.... wow. You can definitely be far and clear, however, the AI will still circle in a small radius a fair bit away, glitching out away from you, and gets confused between heading away, or coming back, when it should be heading away.

TBH I found most of the micromanaging leaning towards pausing the game, and trying to get past the bugs. Maybe I'm just late to the party dealing with the latest patch with bugs?

- Beautiful graphics
- Very detailed Micromanagement, which I like a lot.
- Thrilling feeling when submerged and on the hunt for tonnage.
- Brutal and unforgiving when being hunted by enemy destroyers/planes/speedboats etc. Every single noice source could be the reason for your destruction.
- Damage management can be hardcore and requires a lot of priority setting to survive. ( Which leak is the most dangerous one and needs fixing first/close bulkheads or not to prevent water to flood all compartments/activate the pumps to force water out of the submarine but could get you uncovered again/etc.)
- You can buy/acquire upgrades for your sub which have quite some nice effects. (Better radar detection/better Hydrophones/Better accumulators/etc.)
- You can specialize your officers a little bit with different skills

Cons;
- The game gets boring pretty fast at the current state.
- Some special missions are bugged like hell so you cant finish them. (Weather station on bear island)
- Special missions during your missions are almost the same every time. (BDU sends request to inspect lost U-boat = Crew died from leaking batteries in 5/8 cases so far). A little bit more variation would be nice.
- There are some bugs when crew members get wounded without a reason and the boat gets damaged without anything being in the vicinity of it. 
- The upgrade system is nice but I´d love to have more detailed options. (New Diesel engines/better propeller/polishing the hull/etc.)
- The same thing for the crew. I´d love to have a more in depth oversight of the skills/perks of my officers. Like how good they are in different jobs and the ability to increase them through XP.

Overall: Its already a nice game which can become overwhelmingly good with more content and some polishing.

It revolves primarily around crew management, particularly managing your few officers. The other crew are simulated as a secondary asset, keep them rested and in good morale. The submarine aspect is secondary to the crew management - a few steps closer to bomber crew than Silent Hunter 4. But it's in a far more realistic environment than bomber crew, though not hardcore, more silent hunter 5 than wolfpack in terms of realism.

Overall it makes for a great blend of submarine and crew management. They've really nailed the gameplay loop. Aside from that, the graphics are obviously amazing as the screenshots demonstrate. They've really listened to the audience and put a lot of work to match our requirements with first person modes and more simulation based areas. The game was a bit repetitive but after they added a lot of content to resolve that. New updates are still coming through fast with quite substantial changes on the horizon and no hint of slowing.

Ultimately if the genre of crew management and submarine based gameplay appeals then this game is an absolute gem. Especially for its price, its a steal.

Like all good sub sims, it slowly builds the tension and drama as you stalk your prety. In the finest tradition of Silent Hunter 3, there is also a management/career function that in UBOAT reaches remarkable heights. You won't just find yourself sinking allied shipping (though you will find yourself doing that a lot), you will also hunt enemy battleships, dive for sunken gold, insert spies, and more. And when things go sideways, the damage control experience is a rush. Well worth $30 at full price, and if you can buy it on sale, you are getting a remarkable bargain.

Also, a quick note- some of the negative reviews may complain about an incomplete game or buggy updates. You should discount those reviews- the game is stable and fully playable in my experience, and the developers learned their lesson and I think recent and future updates arrive with much more QA.

It's visually quite nice.
You can set the difficulty to your liking (how much the ships leaks, how realistic the torpedoes work (or don't work), how dark the nights are...
Challenging to master torpedo calculations, making hits very rewarding.

[h1] Oh no.. [/h1]
Some features (or lack thereof) just downright break the game and immersion. Some of these should be on top of their list, but somehow are not.

[b] Damage control: [/b]
Hatches. The BLOODY hatches. The sub has 10 and 16atm hatches. Great. There is even a button ""seal bulkheads"" . If you get hit by a plane and the sub leaks like crazy, you can click that button to seal off flooding compartments...Only it does NOTHING. They just open the doors for fuckall reason and let other compartments flood. 
The engine room is flooded... better go to the kitchen to grab a fresh banana and FLOOD THE BRIDGE IN DOING SO. Why? Just Why!?

[b] Staff control: [/b]
You can only control the officers. 95% of the time, that's fine. It's all you need. Until it isn't.
On the surface, no time to dive, aircraft coming in for a bombing run. I want to get everybody below deck except the person manning the AA gun so they don't get blown off the deck. (For some idiotic reason only be your leaders may man the AA gun too... No biggie if you lose the captain anyway right?). 
Too bad you can't get select anyone to get them below deck. If you're not submerges, you have 2 or more dickheads just standing on the tower with binoculars. That's great for spotting ships in the distance. Feels realistic when they grab a smoke. Too bad they also just sit there as the plane makes its bombing run. Aaaaand then they get thrown overboard. Everybody who gets thrown overboard instantly dies too. No chance to pick them up. Wow, great feature.

Worse still, sometimes non-officers get stuck behind a door and just stand there trying to open the door. This results in them slamming the door 354364354 times per minute, WHILE YOU ARE RIGGED FOR QUIET BECAUSE THERE IS A DESTROYER ABOVE YOU. Annoying and totally breaks immersion.
Even worse: when there is a flood and you need all hands to get the water to the one compartment with a pump... There is always one dickhead that just keeps running in the corner behind a door and gets stuck and can't help out. There is nothing you can do except order the evacuation of the whole compartment.

[b] The voice lines: [/b]
I know, not a top priority. I get that.
But hold on to your sanity when you are withing hydrophone range of another sub being attacked with depth charges. Your radio operator will let you know there are depth charges being dropped... over and over and over and over again.
Without exaggeration, he might whisper WASSERBOMBEN in a total of 3 different intonations in your ear for 20 times. BACK TO BACK. Easily.
Luckily there are a couple of other voice lines the crew throws in there too.
Like... a couple. Two.
Either they bitch about how bored they are or they let you know service in the navy runs in the family.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Quite frankly it's great fun until you realise that it just hasn't progressed and end up searching for issues, that then lead you to circa 2019 unanswered posts. 

Could be great but has that unmistakeable aroma of run for some money and run on; currently --at time of writing-- 9 GBP odd for a bit of unpolished fun-- the fact they are concentrating on VR -- that smacks of keeping up with the Jones' and run away.

For example, when traveling to the patrol spot I have to hit the max time compression button 50+ times sometimes because the boat slows to a lower time compression in shallow water but doesn't automatically return to the higher compression once its back available.  This is trivial to program but they refuse to do so.

And it doesn't slow down the time compression when it would actually be helpful,  ie oxygen level very low, sprang a leak, crew members injured and need medical help to prevent dying.  So the only way to safely use very high time compression on patrol is to run on the surface which isn't always a good option.  The makes for very tedious patrolling.

It has a pretty good system of letting you control how difficult the different aspects of the game (ie how realistic damage is, how often torpedoes fail, how much you have to micro the crew)  But you can't adjust these mid-campaign so you can't make things more difficult as you learn the game without starting the campaign again from the beginning.

1-> The bow saw of the submarine is missing.
2-> The coffee should be in the storeroom where the canteen, and the first aid kit in the officers closet.
3-> The second world war starts in 1939, it doesn't give you the option to start it in that date.
4-> You could use one of the toilets for storage as an improvement in the submarine to be able to transport more food or other materials.
5-> Once the mission is completed, you could receive new missions by radio.
6-> The binoculars are objects, as such, should be able to buy. that adds a level of difficulty in the guards.
7-> It would be possible to improve the inventory slot of each officer. An officer can carry binoculars, cigarette packs, camera, etc.
8-> add toolboxes, to buy.
9-> send SOS to other ships that may be nearby.
10-> The submarine in contact with the sea is exposed to corrosion, as such, it should be able to be painted, and should be getting rust little by little.
11-> be able to order silent navigation.
12-> To be able to save battery by deactivating expendable elements like light can be done, but it does not act on the wear of the battery etc.
13-> Flashlights. It is an object, as such should be able to be purchased, and should be able to equip any character, that implies an inventory backpack in the officer accordingly.
14-> The Captain should carry a Luger. The Luger is an object, it should be able to be bought.
15-> MP40, MP44, and ammunition for all weapons, that will give more difficulty. The mp40 I think is available, but the ammo for them is not, and it would be interesting.
16-> When boarding a ship, an officer and crew should be able to carry a life vest, a weapon and ammunition.
17-> Toilets are purely aesthetic, they could have use, as Germans are human beings and need to relieve themselves.

So i´ve been playing this game for a while now and managed to get sunked once while dowing quite a few boats.
Beeing unable to recover your boat while sinking down the ocean is quite and imploding experience. However there are things to complain about among the things that are done great.
The whole interaction between the player and the Submarine is great. You can manage the boat all yourself or let the AI take over. Everything can be played in real time and everything can pressure your endurance. You´ve got serveral subs to steer in different time periods all over the war and there is stuff to do outside of the typicial ship sinking morning routine. 
But here starts the points that are not allways bright and shiny. Whatever you do as skipper of an Uboat it has no consequences. You cant change the war. Not talking about the outcome of the war, rather talking about land control or science or air strikes. Stuff like that. Whatever you do or what you dont do feels like well try again or repeat and do more. But there is no newspaper telling about what happend then nor any news that inform you of any consequence or whats so ever. Its blend. Flat blend. The same goes for other things too. Your marines have no personality. Yeah they can go crazy sometimes, but there is no character hinter the little animated fellows. No family or love drama, no letters from home, no joy or uplifting spririt that tries to keep moral up. If they die, they parrish into meaningless. You just hire new once. 
Besides all that for a sub sim you need a few mods to increase the experience. It doesnt matter if communication between the Submarines telling about discovered convoys or a good Torpedo calcuclator that allows you set things manually in style. I dont get it why stuff like this not part of the game or became part of the game.
Dont get me wrong the game is great. I love sailing and sinking ships. Even so i tend to miss a lot. The struggle is real. Facing a convy and being clumsy ended me imploding at about 400meters. The treat feals real.
I would recommend this spiritual successor of Silent Hunter. But i can understand if you wait for more to happen to it.",1653513871,1654507616,True,7,0,0.609966576099395752,0,True,False,True

I used to play its previous submarine simulator series 'Silent Hunter' for hours. I suppose its because its got a multitude of assets, from general boating to warfare, crew management, stock control, upgrading parts, third person and first person views any time, great graphics, many things to operate from sonar to bilge pumps and lights. Fuel control and electricity conservation. Rewards for successful missions. You can also just use it as a ship simulator if you just want to sail around the bay. Realistic Ai means the closer you get to the enemy coast the more trouble you will find, from destroyers to aircraft and even enemy submarines. There is a time skip function for the longer journeys which is needed as this game gives you the possibility to patrol anywhere in the world provided you can get the fuel. I cant stop returning to it. Highly recommended.

Running Windows 10

UPDATE: the last time I had an update (hotfix), I lost all my saved progress? Its still in the saved game list but says its not compatible? There is supposed to be a method to overcome this but cant get find it.

If I had to add something it would be to upgrade the navigation station to make it more realistic, so you could switch between a manual mode and the existing automatic function, Use a sextant etc and to add more coastline graphics such as towns and famous landmarks. It could turn it into more of a simulator without loosing any of the existing playability. No boating game I have played has realistic navigation.",1597558142,1653325624,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Personally I grew up playing subsim games like Graywolf and the Silent hunter series, but to say that I am a hardcore SubSim guy would be a lie. 
That being Said UBoat besides looking beautiful has added some very cool features to a sub game that do make it a very enjoyable experience.  The cut away hull effect to see the ships is great and while the camera can be a little clunky in places overall it is great if you want to get a third person view of the battlefield and watch the action up close and personal.
With that said almost every part of this game is clearly lacking the polish of a finished title. Most ports are empty, Missions are lacking complexity. and The game has several weird bugs that can break immersion. One mission I can use as an example was when I was sent on patrol near ""Scapa Flow"" a major British naval port where a famous u boat raid happened resulting in the sinking of a battleship during the war. After Several attempts to pay homage to that attack the result was a complete flop, the port was empty and lacking anything for me to do despite the difficulty of sneaking into base. The other ports on the map besides your starting one are unusable. The crew seem a little buggy in places overall. The game needs more polish before I can give it a recommendation, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t potential here. I really am hopeful for the Future of this game if the developers keep working on it that is. Since the pandemic I really haven’t seen any progress on the title for some time which does concern me. While Steam is a great place for people to play games from smaller developers that don’t have the marketing budgets of AAA developers, I still dislike games being sold to the public when they are still very much in the infancy of their development cycles. UBoat, Unfortunately falls in that category for me which is why I can’t recommend it to the average gamer, but If you are a Subsim fan it’s worth checking out. Hopefully someday soon I can come back and flip the thumb on this review when the game becomes more fleshed out.

EDIT:
I came back to give this game another attempt after leaving it the way I did, and frankly, after another 20 hours or so, I still cannot recommend it. Uboat has seen its share of improvements over the last few years and some of the issues I mentioned above have been ""addressed"" but the game still feels shallow in a lot of places. I cannot exactly put my finger on it but the game really needs extra polish in terms of its mechanics to really make it a worthwhile game. I find myself constantly comparing this to the old silent hunter games and while there is no argument that Uboat is graphically an improvement ( it better be considering it over 10 years newer) it still lacks depth in the combat, the damage, and how it is rendered, the ports and cites, and the missions themselves.  Think I will be putting this one on the shelf for a little longer.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

__f) telling them i've spotted a convoy
__g) asking them the weather
__h) telling them the weather
__i) inviting them to join me to do something

Inside the uboat (this is far fetched, but one can hope):
--To be offered an option for FULL HARDCORE REALISM
__a) No UI whatsoever
__b) Every thing that was supposed to be displayed within the UI, to actually be shown inside the UBOAT
__c) Lock FIRST PERSON on skipper, no more changing views between officers
__d) with this being said, there should be options on telling crew/officers what to do, like:
____1) ""Hey engineer, prioritize fixing ventilation systems""
____2) ""Hey leader, go main the 88 gun""
____3) ""Hey radioman, check if there are any skippers around""
____4) ""Hey navigator, give me a course to the patrol area""
--and asking for information like:
____1) ""Hey radioman, what do your elvish ears can hear through the hydrophone?""
____2) ""Hey navigator, where are we right now""
____3) ""Hey chief engineer, can you give me a damage report?""


More in depth interactions between the various hardware systems of the uboat, like:
__a) Checking diesel oil, pistons conditions etc
__b) Checking batteries conditions, wires etc
__c) Checking ballasts, ventilation systems health etc

More in depth Repair/maintanence system, like:
__a) Scrap the generic ""Spare parts"" all together, instead offering the option to bring actual replacement/maintenence parts, like:
____1) Extra wires (yes i've watched DAS BOOT)
____2) Mechanic tools
____3) Lubrificant for engines etc
__b) To maintain the hardware with realistic stuff

Last but not least
--More in depth on demand interactions between my uboat and HQ, like:
__a) Asking HQ what are the news
__b) asking HQ where are the nearest uboats
__c) asking HQ for redeployments
__d) hearing from HQ when i finish a mission i must redeploy to do another one

Special mention:
__a) Being able to free write on your map
__b) Being able to carry a small notebook with the skipper, so as to use it for, well, quick notes

Last last last but not least
AUTOMATE RED LIGHT NORMAL LIGHT

- Changing torps is a pain in the ass, there should be the function to change torps with 1 click and not multiple steps with babysitting the freaking crew
- G7 torp dont chase closes target, this thing can take huge turns and aims at a other target which was 1km away in stead of the target 400m in front of it
+ Mod Support



[UPDATE 10.07.19]

Game is getting better and new features are getting added.
+AI got slightly changed but still lacks immersion during alarm
+Moral system got changed and is acceptable

Atm in this state I can't recommend it.
- somesort of buggy wich is normal for EA
   -> AI stucks on ladder or entrances 
- AI is unimmersive, during enemy contact they playing cards
- moral system is garbage
   -> crew men get mad if the light is not correct or got enemy contact
   -> officer who all rest are still mad because of ""to much work""
   -> no moral gain thru completed task or sunken ships 
   -> no positive moral gain if there are on the hunt (in case of hunt the moral is getting allways lower)
   - crew men of the navy can die of low moral ... I just hunted a convoi to long under water and 2 trained crew men couldn't handle this...)
- the overview over the ship (inventory) is clunky, I have no real fast way to check ammuntion for deck guns, torps or food
- targeting ship via map with the AI is clunky as well, no real way thru changing targets fast thru or calcuting fire solutions 
   on them in a queue
- during flooded compartments AI is unable to leave the section by them self or helping to move water
- crew can't survive 2 days on sea, because of the lack of food (the storage has a capacy of 4 tons but you can only place up to 248kg stuff in it) the real u96 had mission with +-26 days !
- somehow crew can't be healed in harbour
- this is called simulation but can't handle real values from the real U96
   -> U96 could stay underwater for 72hours! not like ingame with 40 mins
   -> mission could take some around a month and ingame my crews dies of starvation within 
       2 day! 
   -> the AI needs more than 1/2h to calculated stationary targets in a harbour! DAFUQ


I would considering buying this again if there is more love to the moral system and weapon engine

Once again dear readers we find a rare gem of a game that learns from the mistakes of a certain developer that rhymes with whobisoft. The development team listens to their player base and is continually evolving the title to a higher standard. I have a B.A. in History with a focus on the Atlantic front (Now I work in the death industry, hell of a career change right?) and lets be real.....Silent hunter V was taking some liberties. That in addition to the wretched practice of DRM that punished you for daring to go offline really rubbed me the wrong way. But!, out with the old in with the new! UBOAT is a wonderful title that not only avoided the Ubisoft model but did so while improving on the submarine simulation genre in every way imaginable.

As a game it lacks a nice story driven mission tree, you just do random generated missions, the information on upgrades is also lackluster at the moment as I have no idea when or if new submarine designs become available.

It's really excellent in its current form.  It can be made as arcadey or realistic as you want, the settings are very customizable.  On my desktop I've experienced some minor issues, like rare crashes when fast-traveling back to the port at the end of a mission, or interacting with the crew multiple times in quick succession at higher levels of timewarp.  Atmospheric and water graphics are fantastic, and the environment is complete with earth curvature changing sunrise and sunset times at the upper latitudes.  Watch the water depth on the map view, it's still easy to get stuck in the shallows.  Buy as many decoys and spare parts as you can cram inside the realistically limited cargo capacity, and don't forget to save torps by surfacing to gun down any unarmed or lonely merchant ships.  Don't fight it out with planes though, keep plenty of men on lookout and dive early - it takes a good 30 seconds to fill the ballast and slip beneath the waves.

Pay attention to your graphics settings, as making your PC work too hard will cause lag and the rare crash, at least for me using a GTX 1060 with a ten year old CPU and mobo.

An incredible mix of elements and gameplay mechanics brought together for a real treat of a sandbox simulation. For anyone remotely interested in the subject matter, or sandbox style simulation games, this is simply a must-try game. The attention to detail is very much appreciated - developers and team please keep up the good work, One notable jaw dropping moment for me, and there have been many, was the first time I heard the tin sound of a rainstorm on the submarine in the middle of the Atlantic while I was trying to plan an attack on a ship convey in rough ocean conditions at night.

Looking forward to the upcoming releases, hopeful for a few bug and stability fixes as well. The UI and menu system is functional in most cases, and there are plenty of mouse hover tooltips to help along the way, but there are still some areas that are less usable than others. Here are a few examples: took me quite awhile to figure out how to get officers to drink coffee to stay awake during long engagements (and even then its very clunky), I still haven't figured out how to use the stern ""pillbox"" or sonar decoys, the ""TAB"" shortcut menu is so critical in getting things done around the ship I find myself wanting other commands as well - such as emergency clearance of the ballast tanks (which I found out was possible only by reading online posts). In fact, if you issue an order to adjust the ballast tanks, it seems to lock the ability to then blow the full tanks, which nearly cost me a submarine after having a few leaks break out since I was in the ""shadow zone"" (also something I learned reading content offline and not in-game). 

Anyway, these are small issues, and considering it is still 'pre-release', this are more than acceptable. This game is amazing.",1642349786,1650844560,True,3,0,0.524886906147003174,0,True,False,True

you are following the propeller sound of a convoy but ""ops!"", it's actually on the other side of Africa...
you stop your sub and compress time to 1800x and it always faces south for some reason...
getting out of port and for some reason a guy got hurt and the sub went back to port...you can't heal the guy and now he is just there in a bunk bed for 3 more years waiting for the war to be over...
you torpedo a boat in port and it starts Tokyo drifting your way, ramming, and damaging your uboat...
much of the game is not resilient, if you try to mess things up will probably succeed like the graphics that show if a torpedo tube has been flooded...anyone that has played the game will know what I mean as the bug has been there forever...
and the list goes on...

For the things I wish were different, the map sucks...all of it,

I don't even know if it is overpowered because it gives you a satellite view of the world or if it is just stupid...
it is always at an angle making it more difficult to proper draw what you want...
when you zoom in all the markers disappear so you don't even know were your uboat is unless your trajectory is on the map but that doesn't actually tell you were you are facing...

So it lets you see everything but it doesn't actually give you the information or the tools to get more information out of it...

Also, a lot of the interaction with the uboat has to be improved. For example, if I'm not wrong, you can check everything about a torpedo on the ""firing menu"" except how long it will take until it is not hot anymore...for that you have to go to submarine view, move the camera to the torpedo tubes and check there...

Might seem nitpicking but after 80 hours it will make sense.

However a good WWII sub environment and experience, dull time was part of living in a german sub at that time, micromanaging well not so much and the game can well become better one day if devs wish so, by delegating certain tasks for crew to do so (there is a game attempt in that order but still does not cover all aspects) but still is a good game in a away better in several aspects than SH series which for more than 10y I regularly play. 

The less good things...

- Micromanaging
- Passing days while docked either waiting for upgrades/cargo, days repeat themselfs (bug)
- Work schedules (well keep the original or you may encounter few bugs trying to make things better)
- Graphics aren't that good but average.
- Target identification and navigation really needs a good look.
- How research and unlock of new tech in this game is simply BONKERS
- During WWII existed different types of uBoats, the game fails to present that, in this respect SH series beat this uBoat game by far.


The good things

- Unique game experience which the latest SH version failed to achieve (therefore ditched) 
- Inside the Uboat matters most not just outside bang-bang-boom, and in this aspect this game delivers it quite nicelly
- Is possible to near automate your crew into doing certain tasks however not every basic thing can be automated... call it ""delegate"".

I watched Litely Salted's youtube tutorials (if you buy this game, you will need to find that or something similar to learn the basics), played for around 11 hours, and still struggled to find a satisfying experience. 

Most of my games are PDX games, or other games like Cold Waters or Silent Hunters. This isn't an issue where the user is uncomfortable or unfamiliar with complex games with vague mechanics. This game has a few issues...

1) There is VERY LITTLE user feedback that can help a user improve their skills. 

2) There is VERY LITTLE in game tutorials to explain how many mechanics work. And, when I say this, I don't mean it in the sense that the devs underexplained various mechanics. I mean they literally do not bring them up AT ALL. How various torpedoes will perform (and why), how to manually calculate your targets, how to establish the best conditions for a hydrophone, how to utilize your attack periscope to calculate target trajectories, and so on are never even brought up. 

In a simple game, user feedback may not matter much. And, one could argue that someone familiar with submarines should already know how many of these mechanics work. But, these mechanics aren't completely realistic. For example, your bearing in relation to land, or in relation to a target (and vice versa) don't seem to have an impact on hydrophone results. In a more realistic game, this would, as it did in real life. 

You could just argue that this game is more of a ""pretty"" uboat sim game where you should allow your crew to automate many of these tasks, and your job is to manage the crew and the boat on a larger scale. But the mechanics aren't in place to do this, and the crew management is extremely simplified compared to other games. 

Finally, just looking at the most recent Road Maps for this game, you will see a great deal about updating the graphics of ports or adding more historical locations as ports...but nothing as it relates to substantial gameplay. For an Early Access Game, focusing on anything other content shows either an out-of-touch dev or a group that is out of their depth in this project. 

This game is really worth avoiding, honestly. It looks great, it sounds great, but it lacks progress and substance that you'll find in other games. Try War on the Sea, a more moddable game with more content (and ships) Cold Waters, or any of the Ultimate Admiral games. You'll get a much better experience, for a fraction of the effort.",1649959950,1649959950,False,107,6,0.718376338481903076,0,True,False,True

-U-boat is so thoroughly addicting I find myself playing it when I should be in bed sleeping because I have work in the morning.
-Sinking enemy ships feels so gratifying. They burn, they explode, or if you put a hole into the right part of the hull, they just slip beneath the waves. Then enemy sailors float around in life boats to admire your awesome looking sub as you parade it in front of them on your way to kill more of their friends.
-You get a feeling like you're really there, captaining a real U-boat. You can order around your sailors in first person, assign them to assist your officers, make them scrub toilets when they are caught slacking, or even execute them as an example for the others.
-Graphics are stunning. When it rains it’s so atmospheric.  
-Every minute detail of how you manage your submarine has a tactical effect within the game. For example, you accidentally left your hatch open and it rained overnight your ship will flood.
-Which brings me to my next point. Shooting down enemy planes and watching them splash into the ocean is so beautiful.

CONS:
-A few graphical bugs 
-When you sink an enemy ship and you see a bunch of enemy sailors floating around in life boats, you can't mow them down with your mounted machine gun yet.(I think they will bring it to the game)
-There is as far as I can tell, one voice actor so far..",1588760986,1649877525,True,21,9,0.560031294822692871,0,True,False,True

It has many elements of realism, but do not confuse it for a simulator. It's more of a naval management game with great focus on having to make sure you have funds to buy ammo and food, keep your crew morale high, research upgraded systems for your ship, and so on. 

A weak point in the current version is crew management: your officers will be driven to exhaustion until you set up their shifts correctly, but it's not obvious how you have to do it. You will either have to rely on a player-written guide or figure it out yourself.

realism level is astounding and it works for every type of gamer for casuals it can be very simple and for the people that have been wanting a good uboat game for ages and know a lot about uboats and love them it can be the most realistic ww2 uboat simulator that has ever existed

missions need more polishing to it but the fact that you can go to different ports and get new mission locations is amazing

i would love to see more ports in different continents like africa or maybe even see allied ports like america in action or see different uboat versions aswell

Of course I've got Sid Meyer's Pirates!, which is a classic. I tried Assassin's Creed: Black Flag on a whim, but still haven't gotten to the sailing part. Then I saw this for sail, and it caught my eye.

It turns out that it's almost perfect. I don't particularly care for the setting; it's not attractive to play as Germans during WWII, but I can look past that. Everything has to have a reason, and sinking tonnage across the Atlantic is enough to play a Uboat captain.

It's obvious that  a *lot* of care has been put into the game. From the very beginning, there's some warnings about realism, and they're well-justified. I have a mix between sim and realism, and have dialed it back some to enjoy things more. I used the presets to get started, but tweaked things to be a bit more fun. The game offers options all the way from playing in strictly first person perspective and using a hydrophone yourself to detect ships to a very basic simulation that requires only point-and-click, with a lot of options in-between. If you want to calculate torpedo solutions yourself, trying to set them to impact a moving ship on the high seas, you can do that. If you just want to fire away, you can do that, too.

The game lets you customize the enemy AI a little, too, which is very helpful. My first run, I thought I'd just sneak up and blow up a cargo ship in the middle of a convoy. With a fresh burst of confidence after sinking some ships in the tutorial, I was sure it would be easy.

I couldn't be more wrong.

The enemy warships should be respected, and I had to keep an eye on my visibility. It turns out Uboats are pretty delicate things, too. I suffered an impact, and in the course of trying to dive to hide, my descent became uncontrolled and I was sunk to the bottom the Atlantic in another Allied victory. After that, I got a lot more cautious. 

It can be a lot of fun to go out in the Uboat. The environment is beautiful, and the developers have put a lot of love and care into crafting a great experience for you. The music stations are limited for now, but they're selling the game for less than $20. I'm surprised at how much they've already done with what they've got, and I'm really hopeful that they'll continue on their roadmap to create a perfect game.

My one, small wish is that the devs themselves or a very talented fan will make a total conversion mod for the game. Let us play in an alternate world where someone else has a Uboat Navy in a variety of scenarios; or better yet, let us play as pirates with letters of marque, capturing cargo, prisoners, and sinking ships for profit.

As it is, though, this is a wonderful, enjoyable game, and I'm grateful that I get to play it. If captaining your own boat in the industrial age is something you think might be fun, then I highly recommend you get it.",1648908703,1649003097,True,3,1,0.536967098712921143,1,True,False,True

I can dive (send a diver) to inspect ships sunk, provided that they are in less than 300 meters of water.   Draw back... you still can't sink the life rafts. You can take prisoners if you choose..

All in all its a good game, quite fun. Graphics are very good, as well as the physics but there are a few minor problems that stack up to make it boring/annoying.

First of all content for it should be added, you can patrol the seas and do officer mission but they become a bit repetitive. Perhaps adding events or special ships, like being tasked to sink the HMS Hood or something. 

Ships are graphically pleasing and the ship sinking is fun to watch however there isn't much variety yet. You'll mostly come across merchant ships, they don't fight back so its easy game. Destroyers are strong, a little bit much so, coming to think of it as i'm writing this review it might of been a bug. However that bug had me throw 5 torpedoes at a destroyer and it didn't inflict any damage. So yea there are a few bugs, like a man standing on your ship deck even though you're 90m underwater, but it should be patched soon enough.

The worst feature about this game is your sailor's moral. They gain fatigue quite easily even though you've just sent them off on a vacation not too long ago and then 4 days at sea they are fatigued. Now you would think being a sailor on a submarine you will submerge and stay under for quite a bit, right? Well not these sailors, as soon as you're under, your moral follows with you. They don't like being underwater. WHY? YOU WORK ON A SUBMARINE! If the alarms gets set off the sailors cry more. WHY!? YOU'RE IN THE ARMY! This stuff should be expected on a submarine but you're sailors are babies that need sunlight. While you're under there is nothing you can do to increase moral, so you're moral will reach 0 before you're oxygen or battery life. 

Other than those flaws the game is still worth purchasing, it is very fun, until it becomes repetitive. I'm Always looking forward to new updates which happen frequently.

New Review:
Since my last review it has improved vastly. All the bugs I mentioned earlier are gone and I haven't encountered them since. They've added new missions, more ships, and more U-Boat accessories. It is very much worth the purchase if you are looking for a navy/submarine game. In my honest opinion, i think this is the best naval game i've ever played so far.

You don't.  (And you probably won't, at least not if you've set the realism respectably.)

Basically, the mechanics are not explained well (no manual, shitty tutes) and they are not intuitive (few tooltips).  You'll just have to learn a lot of it by trial and error.  

Set the realism low at first, until you can fluidly work the clunky UI with all its zooming and scrolling.  Then ramp up the realism and get ready to suffer losses until you learn, by trial and error.

As someone who cut teeth on Microprose's ""B-17 Flying Fortress"" from the old days, I appreciate a good crew management sim.  UBOAT, while super clunky in UI and mechanics, kinda-sorta scratches the itch.

It's the learning curve, though.  I can't play with my kids around.  ""Goddamn AGAIN? Fuck!""

Good:
- Accessibility, the game caters to casuals as well as veterans.
- Crew / Officer managing systems are a neat novelty.
- Diverse missions and the ability to free roam.
- Excellent sea physics and graphics.

Bad (Understanding it is in EA state.):
- Bugs and glitches are rampant to the point that it is sometimes unclear if it is a game mechanic or actually a bug.
- Optimization of performance, animations etc.
- Tutorials cover just the bare minimum, many game mechanis are unclear.
- Ammount of people onboard is too small. (Could be for performance gains.)

The game in it's current state is playable and enjoyable, however, for people who wish for extreme realism/immersion, there is simple features that are lacking and must be compensated with mods, which often additionaly degrade the performance of the game and tend to break with every new game version release. Once a very succesful man said to me: ""I like to have an option of AC in a car. It doesn't mean I will ever use it, but there is an option to turn it on, the button is there."" And similar to that story, UBOAT lacks some buttons (that are easily implemented) as:
- Option to turn automatic all map icons / hydrophone contacts  off and instead must be put in and tracked manually with drawing tools.
- Option to disable tactical view, that is the map zoom that actually shows 3d models, which is immersion breaking as first person mode is not really bound to first person only.
- Option to disable automatic navigation, meaning one has to calculate the voyage and position by hand, and the tools are more or less already available. (This would then disable the now implemented navigation percentage feature.)
- Option to access the map only if an officer is at the navigation post.

These are just options to increase the realism and immersion even more, are simple enough to implement into the existing gameplay as they don't  change it directly. I know there is mods available for majority if not all of the above, yet I would like the developers to push the game to it's limits for an even broader audience. After all, in real life, they had to get visual on target and fan the torpedoes to get a good chance of hit, not this magical hydrophone target course plotting for 5 km sniping we are served from ""expert"" players.

I would recommend the game on a sale in the current form, but I am sure given some time, it will be worth full price.",1645457418,1645457418,True,5,0,0.584870874881744385,1,True,False,True

___________________________________

I am a novice when it comes to Submarine type games. I have not played the Silent Hunter series and found Cold Waters way too challenging... With that out of the way


[h1][u]AFTER 200 Hours in-game[/u][/h1]

I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this game to anyone who loves submarine sims, and especially anyone who loves WW2 submarine warfare. The game has leaped ahead with content patch after patch and is even more amazing than when it first hit. I still find the thrill of hunting a convoy while avoiding those pesky life ending depth charges enthralling. You really feel for your crew and Uboat after spending months and years with them. Great game!

About the Game:
___________________________________

  The game is in Early Access and has only the SANDBOX mode and an unfinished TUTORIAL. Yet, I enjoy this game. There are glitches, sure, but the core of the game is on track to be amazing. At current it is just good. 
    The SANDBOX mode (the bulk of the EA game) puts you in charge of a German submarine crew and its officers. You start out with no reputation in the German Navy and a crew that is green. The ability to research upgrades for your submarine gives you ample reason to keep playing the game by providing motivation to make it through those sleepless dark nights of listening for sonar contacts. Each mission you complete adds reputation and currency that you can use to unlock researched upgrades and crew skills. There are three camera views available (first person, profile/cutaway, and an overhead view) as well as a zoomed out map view. The first person view is intense and takes getting used to; mainly having to remember where things are located in the Sub. This view allows you to take control of certain aspects of the ship like the Anti-Aircraft guns or the deck Gun. You can also access the periscope and targeting scope in this view. If first person isn't for you, the game is playable entirely in any of the other views without diminishing the experience.  Plotting courses is relatively easy, targeting ships is pretty straight forward, but sinking the ship requires steady nerves as hitting it is never guaranteed.  

PROS:
_______________________________________
 
>Great graphics!
>Crew customization allows for a personal touch and you find yourself getting invested in each crew member
>Submarine upgrades! Research and upgrade your sub by sending an officer to HQ for a period of time
>Fast Travel when you need to cover distance fast
>Easy to understand, Difficult to master (even for sub game n00bs like me)
>First person mode makes it seem like you are right there in the thick of the action!
>Manage your officers (Engineers, Mechanics, Radiomen etc.) sleep, work, and recreation/discipline to maintain optimal performance come battle time

CONS:
____________________________________

>BUGS (to be expected in EA games though, BUT the devs listen and react quickly to anything game breaking)   [i]Most are fixed now[/i]
[strike]>Some default controls are clunky and take getting used to[/strike] [i]Controls are better now[/i]
>The cutaway view could use ONE more zoom distance before going to overhead view... besides that, the views are great (even First Person)
[strike]>No campaign yet (Early Access has SANDBOX mode only)[/strike] [i]Now has campaign goals and objectives that shift as the war progresses[/i]

CONCLUSION:
_______________________________________

I believe the game is worth the price because it [i]IS[/i] [strike]has the potential to be[/strike] an amazing management/sub sim. The graphics are beautiful, the game is easy to jump into but takes a while to master. Replayability in SANDBOX mode is high right now and the campaign mode ensures it stays that way.

Not for the current asking price anyway. For any prospective buyers, I would suggest waiting for BIG improvements in the game or wait until it`s on sale for a much lower price (or both!). It seems that at the moment  every patch may correct something, only to find that something that worked previously doesn`t anymore. Add to that the fact that nearly all previous game saves will not load in after a new patch, which inevitably means starting a new game. Couple that with very long loading times and you can soon become a bit annoyed with the whole thing. Yes, I know it`s EA, before anyone reminds of the fact, but there are just too many things going wrong with this AT THE MOMENT,  for me to give it a positive. 

Well, I thought I`d re-visit UBOAT. Things have improved a great deal since I posted my initial review. I have installed a few mods and play beta version b127 and have no issues that I can think of. It`s good to know that some games do receive attention . Recommendable. So, after a lay off, I`m now playing b131 version with a couple of mods. Difficulty is set at 93% .Real nav makes things far better along with TDC etc.,etc. Having played SH5 WoS (with a good smattering of radio and gramaphone mods) and SH4 (TriggerMaru), I think this is just as enjoyable now as those two games are. I think that one needs to play on higher difficulty settings to get the best out of this otherwise on easy modes it`s probably a little too easy and could become boring.

I am updating my previous review which was basically my annoyance at the micro-management but since then  I found a post that shows how to setup your crew management in a basic way so you can get by without having your crew collapsing from sleep exhaustion every 2 minutes because you are on time warp.  This helped a great deal, but I have another gripe, the game difficulty... 

It starts with some tutorials to get you started.  Once you finish them, there is no option of free roam  so you can get to grips with things (Apparently you unlock the ability later on)...  you are sent out on a mission to patrol an area.  I have done the mission 3 times now and have not found a single target in the area.  During the mission however, I receive a radio message ""Sink a ship at ### location"" so I head over there.  
I find a convoy of around 15 ships in a lightning storm.  Bear in mind I have only fired 2 torpedos in the tutorial at this point and not once during a mission, but now I have to try to figure out how to identify and shoot a target with almost zero visibility.  While doing this, I am somehow spotted by one of the ships - despite being submerged and set upon by 6 warships, I didn't last long.

What the game needs is a couple of missions like ""An unarmed cargo ship has lost its engines, go sink her"" or missions to sink solo cargo ships so you can get the hang of things, but no, you are thrown in the deep end (excuse the pun)

The second mission is to infiltrate an English port to identify AA sites.  I got destroyed in that one as well - I nearly made it out but there was 3 ships coming into port as I was leaving.

I really wanted to like this, but I'm uninstalling it after just a few hours, its been nothing but a frustrating waste of money.",1644769985,1644966720,False,2,0,0.472719848155975342,0,True,False,True

It feels very much like the successor to Silent Hunter III, although it's obviously from a completely different developer. Having gone quite some years since I last played SHIII or IV (never got SHV), I got a little rush of nostalgia the first time I set up for a torpedo attack. How realistic are the mechanics of a torpedo attack? I never served on a real sub, much less in WWII, so I can't say, but it works the same as it did in SHIII, which has been the gold standard of subsims since it came out in 2005.

What makes Uboat feel like a successor, and even an improvement (apart from the modern graphics, which are absolutely gorgeous) is the addition of things like wolfpacks, milk cows, special missions (landing spies, setting up weather stations, aiding a damaged U-boat, etc.), and crew management. If you're trying to simulate being a sub skipper (or the commanding officer of anything, for that matter), then crew management really should be an integral part. Unfortunately, this part feels a little sparse after a while, because it doesn't take much leveling up before discipline and stress ceased to be a problem for me. Even when I got sunk in '43, the crew stress never climbed above 60% or so, and I had crew management set to the highest difficulty, so hopefully that's something that gets improved as development continues.

Otherwise, gameplay is extremely solid. Difficulty definitely increases as you get into '43 and '44, to the point that it's hard to even get your first shots off before being detected. Planes are appropriately dangerous, such that even with the maximum AA on board, I still prefer to dive, just like in real life.

Overall, it's very worthwhile, and I'm sure I'll be playing through another career (or two or three) as the game continues to be improved this year.",1644771196,1644771196,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Anyone complaining about micromanagement in this game obviously just wants an arcade point n shoot or has zero understanding of the crew schedule (which honestly takes care of 99% of the 'micromanagement' if you so choose). Some also complain about bugs to the point where i legitimately don't understand how they're talking about the same game. I've had two bugs I can recall in 369 hours of game-play so far. two. for an EA game. I have played AAA full releases WAAAAAY buggier than UBOAT.

I'm a huge fan of the SH series (in particular 3 for me), but this game brings so much more game-play to the table - the ability to board and inspect neutral ships, more varied missions, crew freak-out potentiality after being depth charged for hours etc., picking up survivors, and of course the best graphics I've yet seen in a subsim. 

It doesn't yet have a huge library of merchants and warship types, though an ok amount for EA. I personally don't mind that there's only one playable sub type at the moment - i tend to find other u-boat types relatively same same and the novelty wears off pretty fast but some might find the shine lasts longer and will be disappointed. I prefer that the developers seem to be going for depth of play, not breadth.

This Games doesnt have the flow &the atmosphere from SH3.

Lets take the Scapa Flow Mission as an example what i mean.
In SH3 you can just go there, this isnt a mission, its just there. In Uboat, first if you get there, there are a few corvettes and nothing more. But as soon as you reach the anchor spot of the Royal Oak, the Ship spawns, and as soon as you sink it EVERY FUCKING SHIP TO LONDON KNOWS YOUR EXACT POSITION !!! Why? Cause its scripted so. I got there crawling with 3 knots, shut off everything and a sailor who was to loud got strangled to death. Oh yeah and it was foggy like in a Shisha bar without windows or ventilation. I tried everything to escape after sinking the royal oak. ITS JUST IMPOSSIBLE. I cant see shit through the fog, meanwhile the Destroyers shoot me into peaces from the other side of the Bay !
And then there is the shitty UI of the Game which feels like landing an burning airplane with your feet only.

I really tried to like this Game, but after today i am just sick of it. Ive played nearly seven hours today and most of them  i was looking for some fun. The Mission with the weather station was quite fun i have to admit. But this was 1 out of 7 hours.

So this Game really had some potential and i always thought it might become better, but now, in the year when it will be released, i dont see it anymore. Get yourself SH3 and a Super mod like Living Silent Hunter 3 oder War Ace campaign. There you will get tons of fun and way less frustration.

Be cautious tho, the game progresses very slowly as a patrol takes from around 4 to real 10 hours to complete.

The game is very stable and haven't had a single crash. 

OK the negatives: The game play isn't exactly intuitive. You need to follow some good tutorials found on YouTube. I've played a few missions but overall I found these to be quite frustrating. Building the weather station resulted in 4 of my crew vanishing from the bottom right when they were sent off to build the station for unknown reasons. One of the enemy ships didn't sink properly and was sitting on the seabed so no way to finish it off and as a result it appeared there was no way to complete the mission so had to start a new game. Followed the tutorial on Youtube and it appears to be a bug when I played this mission. The other mission also ended in failure when my sub got attacked from the air and I took damage and sank to the bottom of shallow waters but there was no way to repair the damage as I had run out of spare parts so there was no way of abandoning ship or to summon a rescue or even commit suicide so had to start a new game - again. Third attempt and I ran out of fuel as I didn't have enough to return to port - most of it was used up travelling to my patrol area. I sent a request to resupply but the request was denied. This has never worked in subsequent missions so what is the point in this feature? Your patrols are very limited in time and distance as a result. I also cannot see a way of rigging for silent running - so an option within the game would be desirable. Another annoyance is when you lose your position on the map and you then have to assign someone to the navigation station but it takes a considerable amount of time for this to work  and the active crew member eventually retires to his bunk and when he awakes instead of going back to the navigation station you have to keep reminding him and repeating this a number of times.

Potentially this is a great game however so far I am finding it to be more frustrating that of an enjoyment. Having played the Silent Hunter series I am not exactly new to submarine simulation but I am also finding even when you set the game to minimal interaction with the crew you are constantly having to do something rather than focus on the mission at hand. Perhaps I need more time to settle into this game but so far the mission success and some obvious bugs or missing features are more of an annoyance.",1644171646,1644171646,False,11,0,0.536771833896636963,0,True,False,True

Getting some guy to go to bed then get up and eat....no thanks.  When I went to battle with one person on duty because everyone else was asleep, I decided to take a break and wait for updates.
Now I'm back.  Graphics look nice.  Wanted less micromangement.  Check.  But when I got in the first mission with tutorials on, I did the first one (resupply) no problem.  Then, nothing.  Sitting in harbour, no next tutorial, no way to show how to end mission and move on.  So quit out after 10 min and will read up and see how one plays the game.  Would love to get to sea and shoot things but want to do tutorial first and that system seems broken.  Was easier the first time I played it.

Original review:
So far so good.  Only 13 hours in.  Shout out to Lite_ly Salted Youtube tutorials.  Much appreciated, lots of info not readily available in game.  Between tutorials and hotfix, many of the issues seem to be fixed as time goes on.  Well done to devs.
Had an issue turning lights on and off (disappearing switch) but seems fine now.  Bit of a drag when I time compress and am at 1800x when I realize that no one is on watch.....maybe a pause can be built in if so OR drop to 1x to allow for us/me to get some of the officers out of their bunks to do some work...
Anyway, very good game so far.  Just sinking freighters and tankers so far, I'm sure things will pick up soon.",1610278142,1644046155,False,0,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

It was a promising enough game for me to promise to change my review should it improve.  So this is a changed review changed from negative to positive. I've kept the original and clipped it as appropriate...   

""It really is a beautiful looking game, great artwork and certainly creates the 'feel' of being in a Uboat.   It has a wonderful start up and gets you out to sea looking all nice if completely lacking in what you needed to know from the tutorials like all the extra steps needed to simply fire a torpedo, then you see how messed up this game is.<fixed>
As you patrol the first thing you notice is that all the convoys loading with stuff HQ wants you to sink are heading west back to the states not east to the war and you are given the impossible job of chasing surface ships that are already 100's of KM ahead of you and already at full speed.     Then you get orders from Hq to travel hundreds of kilometers out of your area to chase bogies that might have been there when the orders were given but have long since headed for the Equator or are making grand 1000Km circles around some spot in the Mid North Atlantic for some reason.
So, now you spend hours and hours managing your officers sleeping habits and lack of desire to effectively cover the positions of the boat that for some reason outnumber the officers (funny how with a staff of two extra crewmen per officer a station cannot be manned 24/7 and routine things just happen, like pumping water out of the boat).   Seems the crewmen will only work when an officer is awake and over their shoulder.<much improved>
Finally after hours of playing the game trying to catch ANYTHING I finally find something to TRY and sink.
Ok so periscope hardly works, preferring to stare at the surface of the water instead of at the horizon unless you go into and out of the periscope multiple times or perhaps change the zoom 20 times.   Locking the target does nothing, absolutely nothing, doesn't even lock the periscope to the target. <improved>  Then if you can get the periscope working your have to fumble you way through all the jobs your Officers should have done for you.. like identifying the target and marking the target (that is if the graphic of the boat shows up at all), figuring out it's speed and course twice over even though you've been closing on it for hours, making solutions all those things that you fire control guy should have done already as unlike the captains of old that could when needed 'shotgun' their tubes your fire button simply doesn't work until every step is done, even if it won't let you do them for some unknown reason like no masts of the target that is only 50m away showing on your glitched periscope view.. did I mention that by the time all the steps are done (regardless of time setting) your target can close from Km away to touching your bow and escape back into the fog by the time you officers get to station (or even successfully get out of bed) and anything even starts to happen towards the goal of just launching a torpedo.

In the tutorial somehow you magically sink a ship with a spread of torps from 2k away, very rapidly it glosses over the steps and does them for you so you don't learn anything and don't practice doing any of it, once in actual simulation your lucky if you even allowed to fire your torps amid trying to get your brain dead officers to man their posts and do all the extra jobs along the way (like turning ""officer of the watch"" items like pumps and such on and off), figuring out all the extra firing steps they should have done already, doing all those steps like your the only man in the ship, and the big one seeing if your LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A FIRE BUTTON THAT WORKS when you finally have everything done.   No other game I've played has been as difficult to simply fire a torpedo as this on on the most basic (easiest) settings, no fun at all.    <This greatly changed after the last update that seemed to much improve officer response, task handling, It is less glitchy, as well as improvements to the tutorials> 
Current conclusion... Combat in this game thus far is a total fail if and when you're 'lucky' enough to have it happen at all.   
Having played Gato, 688 attack sub, Silent Service 1,2,3, all the Silent Hunter games including the online attempt, and a number of other sub games I'd say this game has the potential of being the best sub game ever, but as it is so far it's the worst I've played.   
 
Being a war sub game, combat is the most important aspect of the game, it has to be smooth, fun, realistic, and with the key elements like the periscope and fire controls working smoothly and easily as that is the heart of the game.  Having the con in sub combat should give you the feeling that you have a crew working as a team around you and your job is to track the target in the scope and press the fire button when it's ready (or even just be the guy holding a stop watch and saying ""loss"" while the rest of the officers actually do all the periscoping and button pushing), not that you have to do all the jobs of 5 different officers manning two periscopes and a sonar screen do, just to get your fire button to light up.

<Multiple complaints about combat now deleted due to massive improvements with the latest update.  Do note that the largest improvements were in the context of officer response and tool performance (charts and fire control) without glitching.  This vastly improved the combat experience.   The periscope still has an annoying tendency to be pointed either at the ocean floor or the sky when first looked through and swiping to move it doesn't work for me.  Although originally I tried these keys I've since been told A and D, Shift A and D for fast works). > 
  
I've wanted to see a good new Sub game since they pulled support of Silent Hunter Online and campaigns no longer saved.   I do have hopes for Uboat and am going to delve into possible solutions for the problems I'm encountering with the game.    As I do I hope I'll be writing a better review.

******UPDATE*******
I want to express that the response that Customer Service has given me to this post and the earnestness of them to understand me, respect my critique, and work to improve my experiences with the game is top shelf.   It has been a most pleasant surprise and has inspired me to continue to explore the game.  With good results as I have indeed changed from not recommending this game to yes I do recommend this game with certain caveats.
There is a world of difference and play between abstractly playing click and play from the charts and allowing the game to do the combat while you watch the show and take pictures and playing an active role at the periscope like I'm used to.
With the new Update there has been fixes and some changes to both the tutorials and crew behaviour/control that have improved first experiences with the game immensely. 
The Baby Sitting aspects are somewhat mitigated once a new officer posting is earned and I don't recommend the game if running the crew aspects are not your cup of tea.
There is still some bugs and glitches but much less, some negative aspects still keep me from saying best sub game I've played.    Yet I still see that potential so if your really into Sub's or sub games you will certainly find this game interesting and as I said the support I've received has been top shelf.",1633839316,1643188665,True,1,0,0.503136754035949707,0,True,False,True

The game offers a nice intermediate menu and interaction system in the port alongside a tutorial that, while not offering a 100% complete explanation of the game's mechanics, does actually educate players to an acceptable level of skill to begin playing.  This is a pleasant contrast to some simulation games that simply throw players to the wolves and often times require the players to find an independently prepared tutorial on Wikipedia or YouTube.

Attention to detail is superb. Officers and crew can be customised and skills can be earned. You even get options to alter the uboat lights to red for night vision and blue for silent running.

The sheer terror of staying submerged while enemy ships circle above and drop depth charges is unbelievable until you experience it. 

Options to move your officers to handle repairs wearing breather units and close off flooding compartments can be overwhelming as you juggle priorities in your head, with the opposition listening for the slightest sound to betray your position.

The management settings are expansive; you can set priorities for both and leave them to the AI while you wait for them to see smoke on the horizon suggesting new prey ahead, or drop to 50 meters and have sonar listen for propeller noise, then surface and dash toward the target's general position and rinse/repeat until you can see them through the periscopes.

You can manually operate a lot of equipment in first person, and I'm still finding electric panels and compartments to open and explore. There are even two toilets you can go in if the stress becomes unbearable as compartments flood and your companions drown all around you.

Love the way you can treat wounded, and I'd advise having the sonar officer carry med kits around all the time. Also, grab a breathing kit before tackling repairs in flooded compartments or you will probably drown.

Things I hope are on the list of additions would be: 

Load/load-heat torpedos to the officer dropdown as you have to manually walk the engineer to the tubes and select load atm unless they have it as an assigned task. This can be a pain if you are wanting less noise, so I leave it off in routine settings.

Some option to secure and guard rescued enemy survivors in a specific compartment. Pistols would be good for crew to retain control.

Best session:

Encountered a convoy, wasted 4 torpedos at absurd range, then was depth charged forcing repairs. Another AI uboat came along and sunk a ship distracting the enemy and gave me time to pump out water and return to the fight. Bow torpedo room was totally flooded. Whole thing lasted hours and had to time operating the pump and reloading to short safe moments.

Eventually sank a straggler with deck gun because low on torpedos.

Carried on to finish Enigma mission with 3 torpedos left.

Some bugs and idiotic AI from time to time, but I forgive it as it is Early Access. Even the sailors look like the actors from Das Boot. The submarine layout and design is exactly the same and I dare say even the voice acting sounds eerily familiar like in Das Boot.

User friendly for those new to the genre like me; you can add mods to add complexity and realism like the Silent Hunter series. While it feels 'bare', they are slowly adding things like boarding and checking the cargo from neutral vessels, and different missions to keep one entertained.

Story time: I had a mission to establish a weather station on some light forsaken rock in the Arctic Sea. Went there, no problem, sent my men to set it up and while waiting I was ambushed by two Soviet destroyers. Crash dived with two less officers as they were on land, and scrambled to get a rough firing solution with my torpedoes. Sank one and while the remaining destroyer struggled to find me, I fired another salvo and sunk it as well!

The attacks to your uboat are very realistic to the point it makes the game damn near impossible. I have tried so hard to like this game but right now I find almost no fun in it the missions are very boring and outside of managing your uboat the game has nothing to really do. Ultimately this game needs alot of work and I feel it was a bad mistake to waste 30$ on this game( funny it went on sale for 13$ the next day that was salt in the wound lol) I would recommend to wait until they do something better with the game or just don't buy it at all it will irritate you and bore you to death. Unfortunately I don't qualify for a refund being I played for 15 hrs in two days but I guess it is what it is this game will definitely make me alot more cautious with buying games on steam unless they are on sale.

UBOAT is an amazing experience but only when it works.
I have 8 hours of gameplay and so far have suffered from countless game breaking bugs that make me rage quit at times. In my 8 hours I haven't been able to sink a single ship yet.
Bugs such as a never ending saving screen, no enemy ships spawning at all (also can't complete missions), and a handful more make this impossible.

If the game gets updated I will update my review as one would expect.

Currently I'd advise many people to stay clear until development progresses, because the game needs a lot of work.

Original review-
I bought this quite a while ago now and it was pretty obviously early access. Just today I re-installed and its breathtaking how much progress has been made. As a solid SH5 TWOS user, Im pretty sure this is going to be my go to Uboat sim now, as its just so engaging. The graphics are nice, the level of interaction is just about right, the choices you can make with pretty much everything are really cool and make the boat feel your own. The new menus that were not there last time I played for setting rosters etc are a really really nice idea. I think this could be a classic in the genre. Big thumbs up and a solid recommend! 
One word of warning- take the time to watch some youtube tutorials, otherwise the depth (no pun intended) this sim offers could be missed. There's an awful lot going on For Example something as simple as switching to blue light when submerged will send crew who are not doing anything to the bunks to preserve O2.",1615136945,1641543858,True,0,0,0.547143518924713135,0,True,False,True

I dropped the game (due to external life things) only to find out when I could play games again that this game had evolved into something that is not only playable, but virtually bug free now! So many of the issues you see people harping on in the negative reviews have been fixed wholesale.

I was worried this project would flounder and many of the bugs would therefore be left untreated, ultimately leading to the game's demise... But how wrong my fears have been! The UBOAT team has dedicated developers who truly want this project to be the best it can be, and they are doing a damn fine job at it!

#1) If a ship is fully manned, even if in Port, there should be an Automated Generator that kicks in to Prevent ""Power-Loss"".
According to what I know about the Navy, regardless of Origin or Timeline; the ""crewmen"" would already know to kick on the diesel to power the batteries and would NOT need to be told by the Captain or Skipper to do so.

#2) Crew/Officer duties
As with any job, there are 3 Shifts; Morning Watch, Swing & Night watch, yet UBOAT does not account for nor Crew/Officer rotations; thus, anytime you depart for Missions, they are ALL exhausted and Unable to properly Function a ""Warship"", leading to ""Lost at sea, Depleted Power and Unable to move"" etc., etc.

#3) Bugs
I've played 5 cycle starters, each one failed because of the listed problems above to go along with improper balance of fuel. (ie: Leave Port, travel to Destination; 1/8 tank left, patrol 1070 km, no fuel left but fumes)

Lastly, The company PROMISED B131 Hotfix 1 would be the Ultimate repair to other known bugs; yet here we are again in 131/1 with many unsolved issues.

What a game! This is everything the Silent Hunter series should have been and more, really really glad i bought this.

I'd love to see some DLC in the future that allows us to play as other nations submariners - I'd love to play as the British subs out of Malta for example.

Dear Devs - I love this game, the attention to detail is superb and you can tell it's been made out of passion for the subject - there are so many improvements here over the SH series, i love the little expeditions and interactions (weather station on bear island for example)

Great game - buy it.

Not one crash in 33 hours of play.  This is an outstanding, challenging, and realistic WW2 sub simulator.  I now highly recommend this game.

PRIOR REVIEW:

Game looks amazing, and I hope some day it will be, but despite being available for a long time now, this game is still not stable enough for even an early access release.  It has crashed to desktop or totally locked up my machine nearly every time I've run it.  I really respect what the devs are shooting for, but there's still a ton of work to be done before I would call this a playable game.

This will happen if you don't pay attention to crew schedules and roles. Now that I understand it's not a problem, but it was a long time coming to get things running smoothly. I think the game would be better if it would notice when you're doing something bone-headed and tell you to fix it.

2) Problematic UI, and poorly written tutorial.

during combat, 

for a certain action
- ZOOM IN: to show submarine interior (side-view with depth perspective, in which someone may block on something)
- SCROLL (left-right-up-down) to find where is the the certain person: (name over his head), who has the required skill to the target task
- CLICK on the certain man:
- SCROLL within the sub: to where the post station is, that has the equipment to do that task
- MOUSE OVER the equipment: to light up the control panel
- CLICK on the lit-up panel: to order the clicked man to walk to the post an do the operation
- ZOOM OUT: to go back to the combat map
... that's how to assign a task, 

during a submarine combat, by its captain?

You should train you crew about what to do, set up the basic rules and priorities / limitations. Not shout at each person, each and every time you want to do that task; for what-to-do & where-to-do-that during (submarine) combat.

Individual orders shall be given only when you want to override the rules, with perhaps a pull-down menu by person or by task type (multi-role character, or conflicting tasks).


some other problems in UI:
- panel for certain frequently used (ex: time speed) function jump to different positions in different views
- different UI layout / control screen for specific tasks (specific task tool oriented design); that shall be able to get covered (integrated) by fewer common main UI layout / control screens, in that they already hold the needed elements (target / efficiency oriented design).

For some, be required to switch / scroll between multiple screens and controls to assign crew orders may be a Positive factor; but certainly a Negative factor for me. I don't consider it's realism for required to manually SCROLL-and-CLICK people and control panels, each and every time, for tasks that a trained crew should know WHEN and WHERE to do it.",1640282092,1640307773,False,49,5,0.640695035457611084,0,True,False,True

UBOAT is a gem in the making that has amazing potential. For now I am giving it a 'maybe' in the form of a thumbs down, because there are some issues that severely impact the experience. Hopefully I can change this into a thumbs up by release.

[b]NOTE:[/b] There are many things about the game that are great! I'm not pointing them out here, cause they don't need fixing and you can enjoy experiencing them yourself.


[b]Some of my issues are, in no particular order[/b]

- There is no way to make temporary course adjustments and then 'return to course' as in the Silent Hunter series. I want to be able to say 'rudder hard left' in some cases, and 'set course to 310' in others. Without opening the map and ruining my already plotted course. (Update: Apparently planned. Also, you can right click the ocean from orbit view to quickly change course, so that's something.)

- There is also no way to change the course without re-plotting everything, as far as I'm aware.

- There is also no button to say 'set course to where I'm looking'.

- Missions require travel distance inside a map sector, rather than spending time in that sector. That seems odd, and forces you to waste fuel.

- I wish the map had topography colors indicating sea depth. I know I can see the depth in the top-right, but that's less feasible when e.g. planning out a course or doing quick tactical decisions. Especially for shallow waters like in the canal. Apparently this is not even planned.

- I wish I had more direct control, for example over the 'alarm' state. I know I'm not going to engage that freighter for a while, so why can't I call for action stations when I actually need it? Rather than wasting morale beforehand. (Implemented by a mod, but not in vanila.)

- The ""Music"" audio volume doesn't affect the radio music. I want my men to listen to Radio Gibraltar, but I'd prefer not to hear it myself.

- Speaking of the deck gun, why isn't there a magnified optic with range indications? It's even visually implemented on the model, but not usable. This means the deck gun can only be used at point blank. The current ""gun sight"" is actually the attachment point for a crane hook.

- Torpedo ""maintenance"" is a thin cover for what used to be pre-heating, and in its current outfit makes no sense. A torpedo wouldn't lose its well maintained status in 30 minutes. It would make more sense to keep pre-heating for electrical torpedos (to ensure speed and range), and make maintenance for [i]all[/i] torpedoes last much, much longer than it does currently.

- The recognition manual isn't sorted by category, nor by number of smokestacks or anything else. Like... wat? Also, it doesn't wrap around, which is equally frustrating. Both Cold Waters and the Silent Hunter series get this right.

- You can't adjust difficulty settings while playing, even those that it would make sense to let you adjust, like manual targeting. Some settings wouldn't make sense to be able to change mid-patrol, and for those that's fine.

- The UI is at times unintuitive, and there isn't always mouseovertext or other hints as to what a button does or how things work. Particularly on the officer portrait row. For example, canceling a direct officer order is black magic (right click the order), and there is nothing explicitly telling you that giving an order makes it persistent until canceled.

- Various UI problems. For example, in the warehouse there is no indication of how long food will last. (I'm not sure if there's an indication for that [i]anywhere[/i], but that's quite possibly just me not having found it yet.) The tooltips for temporarily adjusting crew assigned to an officer should inform you that you need to go into Management to do it permamently. Checkboxes should have more distinct states. Colors between ""selected"" and ""not selected"" when e.g. saving a lifeboat have too low contrast. Why do I need to hold shift to adjust priorities with scroll wheel? Why do I need to scroll several notches? A bunch of small QoL/polish things that need work before 1.0.

- The distance measuring ghost can be hard to make out. I would prefer a solid line or even centiradian markers.

- I wish there was a TDC implemented in vanilla, to make small adjustments to solutions and basically just give you more options and flexibility. There's a mod for one, though.

- Uboat acceleration and deceleration is unrealistically, almost cartoonishly, high. From a standstill you reach roughly flank speed in ~15 seconds. This should be several minutes. If you stop the engines, you come to a complete halt very quickly, too. What happened to inertia?

- I wish I could explicitly assign priorities based on whether or not the uboat is submerged, and set up a profile for when I'm docked, etc.


[b]Perhaps improved, but not confirmed yet[/b]

- Hotkeys seem improved, but I haven't tested if everything is covered yet.

- The sight and hydrophone ranges seem very arbitrary and change for no apparent reason. At times the hydrophone range seems bizarrely low. Manually looking through the UZO or periscopes can detect targets much farther than the 'sight' range. [i](Update: Improved in B129 Hf. 4, perhaps to a satisfactory level. More testing required.)[/i]

- The officer torpedo solutions are at times artificially stupid. I had a 100 % solution on a ship moving perpendicular around 400 meters ahead of me. I fired two torpedos. Both were aimed [i]behind[/i] the point the ship was when they were fired! Surely Kriegsmarine officers knew that you had to aim ahead of the target, and missing at that range with two torpedos is insane. [i](Update: Apparently fixed or improved, not tested yet.)[/i]

- Crash dive delay seems too long. [i](Update: Perhaps this was user error. With an officer at the valves and a depth keeper it seems better. More verification required.)[/i]

- Officer shifts seem to work better than when I first tested.


[b]Fixed, no longer an issue[/b]

- FIXED! I would like an option to make 'manual mode' the default when entering a station as an officer, especially if doing so in FPP. (Update: Added in B131.)

- FIXED! If ordering an officer to man the deck gun, there is no 'hold fire' option. I walked an officer to man the gun while closing with a ship, to be ready for when I was in optimal range. As soon as I entered the deck gun, I lost control of the officer who immediately opened fire and gave away our position--at far too long ranges. [i](Update: There's now a 'hold fire' option in the top left that defaults to 'hold fire'.)[/i]

- FIXED! Button (but not keybind) to open periscope/UZO has been added.

- FIXED! If I turn on the radios, they won't automatically turn back on the next time the radioman is on his shift, meaning they are worthless and/or very frustrating to use for morale over longer distances. [i](Update: They now turn back on automatically.)[/i]

[b]Honorable Mention[/b]

UBOAT has a permissions-system for mods and checks/compiles mods on itself. This is probably the most secure way to do mod loading while still allowing programmatic mods. Kudos!

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Hopefully these issues will be fixed by release. The game has so much potential to be an absolute gem, [strike]but in its present state is too frustrating to play.[/strike] If you love uboats you'll probably have some fun.

-----

A long time ago, when i was about 6 years old, my parents took me to a german beachtown called Laboe, near Kiel. Right next to the beach, you can visit U-995, a Typ VII C boat. My interest and love for submarines was born. Of course i watched the movie "" das Boot"" a million times! I played games like ""Aces of the deep"" and all the Silent Hunter games. Until this day, i still love SH3 (including mods).

So a complete nobrainer, that i would buy UBOAT and so i did. Unfortuanetly, this game never managed to crap my attention. If steam would allow a medium ranking, i would choose it! 
In comparison to SH for example, this game includes a lot of (in my opinion) pointless micromanagement. While parts of the crewmanagement add value to the game, stopping my Kaleun from gettin to bed during combat, does not!Manually keeping someone of my officers at the maptable, so my boat doesent get lost in the ocean, is also not a valuable task if you ask me personally!?!
The garphics are good, i like the amount of the detail the put into the boat. I also love the concept of the ""outside open view"" where look into the different departments!
But still, the world seems empty (i know still EA, might change), you can cross the english channel by daylight, seeing absolutely nobody... realy? 
The voiceover of the crew (at least german version) is absolutely poor and prevents perfectly that i could even beleave for a second, beeing on a german sub.
Shooting the a 88 manually is a absolut nightmare (and the sound...oh boy), but dont worry, you wont need it anyway due to the lack of possible targets (singl traders). 
Dont get me started on this ""navy seals mission"" you get, where you drop special froces or agents! Or how many times i had to blow up a friendly subs....
In total i must say, its not a bad game, but its no real wwii subsim and never crapped my attention, even if i tried hard to like it :( 

 i m your perfect pray i looove subsims and in 2 years, you made me play your game 40 hours? i must rate you down even if the game is not bad! I will watch the game development and might change my opinion.

BUGGY = Yes
Good Game? = NO
ISSUES= Gunner/ motar does not hit targets even in manual mode its like shooting a blank 
Issues with crew freezing or stuck on a task and cant blow ballast because it says hes working on it but is in bed stuck.
Map travel is extremley slow takes almost five minutes to get to one location thats not that far.
Also when in red alert and alarms are sound the crew should not be sleeping nor in there bunk, gets tiring having to keep switching to them to get them to do something while managing an ataack especially when it comes to planes bombing the UBOAT.

This game... wow. It's just incredible what Deep Water Studio has crafted. I've been playing for about a week now at the time of writing and I cannot stop playing. I had been on the fence about it reading some of the reviews, but I'm so glad I got it. 

It scratches that WWII gaming itch I didn't know I had. The freedom they give you in this game is incredible. I wasn't expecting a mostly 'open world' experience. I was definitely expecting something linear. 

Don't wanna do missions and just sail wherever, whenever? That's great! Do it! They allowed for the freedom to do what you want when you want to do it. So if you just want to patrol and sink anything and everything in your path - this is the game for you.

If you're a U-boat enthusiast/sub enthusiast and you want all the realism? This is the game for you. Only want to play in 1st person to enhance the realism? You freakin' do it. Want to perfectly line up your torpedo shots manually using the attack periscope? Do it. Want to make it so the world is more on a 1:1 scale and you don't fast forward and it takes you 5 days to sail from Italy to France? You freakin' do it. From a real night mode, to torpedo maintenance, and being able to change that difficulty so your shots have to hit perfectly, less you get a dud. 

You can prime the torpedo's to explode on a timer rather than by impact. You can set the depth for them after they've fired.  You can inspect ships that you think aren't actually neutral, or are flying a false flag. 

Bugs? A couple. Game breaking? Far from it. Annoying from time-to-time? Yes. I've had part of UI disappear. But after focusing on a new object, or going to first person and changing back, the UI is back to normal. I had one of my officers tell me he was tired and needed a break for 10 minutes straight. Even when he was sleeping and taking a break. What's great about this game regarding bugs, hit F11 and you've got an in game bug menu where you can submit the bug without having to stop playing. You can also use that to submit a suggestion. 

Are there a few gameplay annoyances? Yes. Mostly your crew that aren't the officers. You have no direct control over their actions, but there are ways of working with that. The AI for them is also better from what it was a year ago (based on other reviews I read).

Mod support? Pretty good. While most mods say they're outdated, most work just fine in the current build and won't cause any issues (even when they say they're outdated in the mod launcher so just ignore that). 

Point being: BUY THE FREAKIN' GAME. The more successful it is, the sooner they implement multiplayer. Now imagine having your own Wolfpack with your friends... you're welcome.",1639443441,1639529778,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You can be looking at the sub in external views, then zoom in and see a cut away section with you crew walking around and interact with everything, this is extremely good fun, and many sub systems are modelled such as charging your oxygen tanks and things like that. Silent hunter doesnt go into that much detail. Also you can take control of any officer and play in first person view which is great!. The missions seem quite plausible and realistic to me.

  ----------------------------------- Positives:
-  Can be complex if you like manual pretty much everything (controls, aiming, etc.)
-  Very satisfying when you land your first torpedo, and then especially when you spend 20 or so minutes trying to hit multiple targets, doing so is very rewarding. 
- You can first person walk in the boat, lots of gadgets to adjust.
-  Lots of tiny events that can happen to you crew and your boat that will require micromanagement, making you feel like you are in a real crisis situation.
-  Campaign can be very long if you want to take on all missions.
- You can research additional tech for your boat.

------------------------------------Negatives 
-All of the mentioned above, for me, became really stale after 40 hours of play.
-Research is done fairly fast, so nothing else to research.
-I kept on playing thinking that there are other subs, THERE ARE NOT!!!  Once you are done with first campaign (more like got too bored with it), I thought to play a different boat, ended up the same exact boat variant, literally no difference at all, just a different harbor and starting year.
-If you played the first Boat, you played them all (not figuratively, there is absolutely no difference).

It has a lot of modern conveniences that SH3 simply does not and I find myself more often than not choosing to play U-boat over SH3. The game definitely still has it's issues and there are a lot of areas in which SH3 is superior to U-boat. 

For example being forced to start at the earliest 2 years in to the war, the world feels very stilted and not fleshed out. Finding a convoy doesn't feel very rewarding as it's practically guaranteed every single patrol. Ships sink WAY too quickly and WAY too easily. As soon as the ship's ""hp"" reaches 0 it just plummets to the bottom. Even on the hardest difficulty, after the first patrol you never have to worry about money again. You can only pilot the Type VII C. Sinking capital ships of the Royal navy feels really underwhelming, and the destroyers are really no practical threat to you.

The core loop and its usability has been neglected and plastered over with eye-candy, side quests and character accessorizing like it's an RPG, and silly Das Boot memes.

Unrealistic missions. ""Go to this square and sink tonnage, NO WAIT sink this *specific ship* in this convoy heading *west* and here's live updates on the convoy location"".

It's a pity how hard it is to make a non-silly sub game to stand up to the 16-year old SH 3.

My first mission was to sink patrol an area, on my way back from this  patrol after completing it I ran into a huge escort group, my radio received a msg to target a specific ship holding some cargo that the  enemy really needed.
I dived to parascope level and kept distant from the warships while they pass me as I was looking around for the target, luckily it was heading straight towards me, I targeted it, moved myself into position, did the calculations and sent two torpedoes,  the first was a dud but the second hit  and it instantly flooded the boat.

There are many great features about this game but there are some that could be worked on. Remember, this is an early access game.

Things I enjoy: I really enjoy the fact that you can pick what year of the war you're starting in. This adds a harder experience to the game the later in the war you start due to the fact of the allies learning about the pattern of Uboat attacks and how to counter them. There are also historic battles on raids the Germans did that you can play and it adds an amazing feel to the game. I love the camera perspective in the game, from having a side view of the Uboat, being able to see every part and room inside. This makes controlling/managing the boat very easy. It also gives the game the sense of life. From seeing your crew get on with everyday tasks to hurrying around the when in spotted and in battle. Another great thing about the camera is the free camera. The free camera gives you amazing opportunities for the perfect screenshots. You can even follow your torpedoes or follow enemy ships to get the juicy photos. The thing I enjoy the most about this game is the satisfaction you get when a torpedo hits a ship. After spending time to work out where to fire your torpedo and seeing the explosion in the distance never gets old. 

Things I like: I like the way you can calculate a torpedo solution. There are two main ways, from the tools provided by the game or manually. Both of these add so much excitement to the game and helps make you feel like the skipper. I also like the crew management. Its very easy to learn the basic of the crew management, from managing your officers and what tasks they're doing, towards how many helpers they have. This is the basic. Short and sweat. You can add additional crew management. From more jobs that need doing to schedules, tasks and squads.

Things I'm 'meh' with: Now these are things I'm not happy nor unhappy about. For an early access game the crew customise is good. I can't wait to see what else they add to the customisation. Right now you can change the basic of things such as their hair/colour, complexion, head shape, facial hair, clothes, accessories, body type and name. All this is great for the state of the game. However, I do wish there was a set outfit you could make all your sailors wear. This would save time on the crew customise. As of writing this you still have to manually select what everyone wears one by one. Another thing I'm meh about is the way you restock your boat. When you're in port it sometimes feels like you have to wait days to get the certain type of torpedo that you want. It would be nice to add a feature where you can go to port and order a certain amount of supplies and ammunition (To counter this make it cost more) this will take away from the wait and from selling and re buying torpedoes just to skip days to see if the ones you want are in stock.

Things I'm unhappy about: When thinking what I was unhappy about, it took me a while to think of one thing. However, after a while I finally could think about what I don't like about this game. As of writing this I haven't seen the chance to form any wolfpacks. Now when I say this I fully understand that you can find other Uboats following a convoy that you're following and tell them to be defensive, attack or escape and that's pretty cool. However, it would be amazing to form a wolfpack with x amount of Uboats, patrolling an area looking for big convoys would be the cherry on top. To be able to hunt for these big convoys and plan an attack would be amazing. I'm not sure if this is in future plans but the idea of seeing/telling the other skippers what ship/ships to attack and then going for the other ones would add another interest to the game.

Things for new players: Before you start your first game, I would recommend for you to pick balanced for the simulation and intermediate for crew management. This allows you to understand the game easier whilst putting you in uncomfortable positions so you can learn and improve. For your main settings have your Audio language in German. Don't worry this just changes the way your crew speak. Hearing your skipper shout 'schneller schneller' instead of 'Faster Faster' really adds to that role play feel. I would also enable the tutorial for the first time but you're always learning. For advance settings have your units on mixed (Km, Knots) this makes it easier to work out manual calculations for torpedoes if you ever wanted to learn it. I would also strongly recommend starting at the start of the war, This gives you the best port to have in the game (IMPO) and you are likely to have cargo ships unprotected show more commonly. 

Remember to save before you attack a ship. If you miss a torpedo you can load the last save and try and learn from your mistake and keep learning until you can hit torpedoes quite easily. Then try not loading and go with whatever happens.",1633972119,1638017997,True,3,0,0.537687599658966064,0,True,False,True

Since the latest update, which I think is B130 right now, I've tried two different first missions in the easiest campaigns and they're both functionally unplayable without save scumming. The first campaign was the recover the enigma machine mission. Load up and sail off with no real problem, great improvments to the travel mechanics, not having to manually map every travel point to stay away from coastal regions anymore is great. Get to the target and there's two destroyers on target for the very first mission. Fine it's a medium mission. Fire every torpedo I have and every deck gun round and I land one torpedo as the TDC in this game is immensely unreliable and if you let the AI compute a solution, you might as well go turn on a movie. The deck gun sight, which uses to be a very usable telescopic sight, has been replaced by a meaningless ring and the AI spends all off its ammo before killing the second ship. That's ok though, because the enemy AI is so inept they let me sit motionlessly on target while clicking through text prompts for 20 minutes before finally raking me with AA guns (I assume they also ran out of ammo on their main gun having never hit me) and I slowly sunk because we didn't have enough spare parts to fix three leaks.

Fine, I haven't been back to the game in a while, let's start with an easy mission so off I go to the atlantic in a whole new campaign. A plane spots me, circles me five times being never hit by the man on the AA gun before I submerge to stop the farce. Plane comes in and drops its' ordinance missing by a huge gap, and one of my sailors happened to...trip and fall into a bulkhead at the same time? The bombs weren't anywhere near us so I'm saying he tripped and giving the devs a freebee on that. Stabilize him, plane flies away, back on route. Get to my patrol sector, patrol for almost the 2k km the mission asks for without seeing anything, before the game takes pity on me and sends me a specific convoy to intercept and a radio message telling me where it is. I go intercept it, nail one torpedo out of five that just happened to hit the target, go deep below anything the allies should reasonably be able to counter by this point in the war, and go silent and still while I wait for the escorts to pass. One of them magically has a sonar that can reach down 130 meters, at the very beginning of the war, and depth charges to match and they sink me. Reload the autosave and go to attack the convoy again and at this point it becomes a comedy. Three attacks on the convoy, three reloads, 15 torpedoes fired with this miserable tools, and I not only never hit the target, I never hit any ship in the convoy period. I'm sorry let me correct myself. 15 T1 steam torpedoes and the one I hit with was a dud.

This game used to be playable, so maybe roll back the saves to when your AI was competent and f*** knows what they did to the TDC but if I can't sit down, and I know vaguely what I'm doing, and I can't sink a massive cargo ship that doesn't even know I'm there in 15 torpedoes, how the hell do you expect anyone new to the community to not refund this? I want to refund this but I put so much time in back when it worked that I can't.

I don't know how much of this comes off as a rant but considering this is the only game I can remember ever moving me to actually write a negative review, don't buy this game.

This is heading out to be a masterpiece that may rival (or already has) Silent Hunter 3 (with GWS Gray Wolves mod).  It can be complex with a bit of a learning curve but you can also turn off many settings and play at a more relaxed play level; it's up to you.  I will say that doing your own work to determine the target solution, especially when you get the knack of it, is not a chore but adds to the excitement of taking down enemy targets -  but you can also let your people do it for you; you're in charge.  Even creating/modifying shift schedules for the boat crew seems a bit scary at first then becomes intuitive; or leave it as is and don't touch it.

Even if you pay full price, it helps good developers.  As of Nov. 2021 it is getting closer to release and the price may adjust upwards(?).

I would love an option to fully remove the FPS view because I always end up activating it when zooming. this is a bit irritating.

You can wait a couple of weeks for some patches to staibilize the game but all in all I trust this game will get better .

But right now there are too many bugs and you should ONLY buy if you are ok to be a beta tester and report those issues to devs and be patient. Remember you only have two hours before you make your mind.

After posting my review one of the folks involved in developing this game reached out to me. This, to me, is a VERY positive sign. It demonstrates that they actually care about their product--which is something I greatly appreciate. This is the main reason I am changing this review to 'recommend.'

Now, there is a caveat with the recommendation. As you can read in the comments below, it's not that there are no ships to hunt. Rather, that for whatever reason, the game assigns patrol zones outside of the actual convoy lanes. Therefore, ""you need to ignore the official orders and move to the populated shipping lanes."" 

While I think that this is a design flaw (and one which I hope is fixed in the future), I do think that I can, in good conscience, recommend this game. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, let's get some things out of the way: UBOAT is still in EA, therefore we all play it understanding that it's an incomplete product. And so, I'd like to focus upon where the game is at as of B129, and with the understanding that this review will be updated as necessary. 

By way of context, I've been a subsimmer for quite a few years now. What appealed to me about previous UBOAT versions was that it was NOT a simulator a la the Silent Hunter series or the more-recent Wolfpack; to be frank, the older I get the less time I find that I have to devote to simulators. So with UBOAT, it was awesome to have a more 'instant action' type of game, one that could scratch the subsim itch WITHOUT requiring hours-upon-hours of play at a time; the whole crew management/survival part was simply icing on the cake!

Now, after a few months' hiatus, I returned to UBOAT in order to check out the B129 update.

In terms of improvements, as always, the Devs have really outdone themselves. In fact, there's too much to even list. But, while I am pleased to see that many of the more-egregious bugs have been squashed, and that, overall, the game-itself and the crew function much better, this update has, unfortunately, also managed to murder much of the fun of the title. 

'How so,' you may ask? In summary, by drastically reducing the amount of enemy ships which are NOT spawned as part of specific secondary missions. According to Steam, I've put 32.5 hours into this version since returning and you wanna know how many ships I've actually found? 

 . . . 2! 

Let me reiterate this, in 32.5 IRL hours, and a year in-game time, I have located only TWO ships--and these weren't even in convoys, I'm talking individual cargo ships! 

For clarity' sake, when out of port, I dive for hydrophone checks 4-6 times per in-game day, have lvl 1 radar, and my watch officer always has two enlisted men attached to him while on lookout. 

And yet, I've found nothing sans the previously-mentioned two boats. Of course, this excludes ships which appear after receiving a radio order (i.e. 'we believe ship X, which is carrying Y, will be at this location so go sink her,' or 'go to this location in order to join a wolfpack,' et al.).

After a while I thought that perhaps I had encountered a bug created by previous version caches or old mods. However, even after clearing all such files, doing a clean install, and loading zero mods the problem persists. 

So, what's the result? Well, I hate to say it but UBOAT just sucks now. While former versions could be frustrating due to their litanies of bugs, the ""fun factor"" of the title was still there: find enemy ships, kill them, repeat this until you need to return to port for ammo/food/whatever (though sometimes, on high seas, enemy ships kill you). 

Was it unrealistic? Yes, it was! However, that was the lion's share of its former fun and appeal--you DIDN'T need to spend countless hours in order to find and engage; and secondly, UBOAT has never been a ""realistic"" game, nor will it ever be...and that's okay! It was realistic-enough to be VERY immersive while being 'gamey'-enough to be entertaining. 

Yet now you're completely dependent upon the little radio side missions if you want to attack anything except for ports. Apart from these (and the now EXCEEDINGLY rare encounters), you sail about doing nothing except hoping to see a radio notification pop up.

Long and short, having fewer ""big"" bugs is great! Having your crew function CONSIDERABLY better than in B128 is awesome! But, having 'empty seas' has simply killed the game.",1635530726,1637336156,True,3,0,0.522297143936157227,7,True,False,True

The worst part of the game for me is Fatigue. I played one mission and now everyone is tired; playing cards, playing music and giving extra food variety it still says it takes 10 days to return to normal. 

Try to move outside of the port and you have to micromanage the speed and direction because you may hit the port that the sub crew can't navigate around, wasting incredible amount of time because again everyone on board is a robot. Even then it sometimes damages your boat: I crashed into something one time after pressing time compression and collided with an unknown object on the water (after carefully maneuvering outside of starting dock) - killing a crew and causing leaks. Unless you're willing to treat the game as a REAL U-boat and spend weeks of real time watching every movement you're bound to hit something or miss something. There are no stop gaps that pause time when a collision occurs, it keeps counting time and murders wounded crew that could have been saved had you NOT used time compression - but if you don't use it, again you're stuck staring at the screen for minutes/hours while your boat moves. Very, very dry and boring. Silent Hunter 3/4/5 are tedious but still workable whereas this game still needs some work to remove the tedium. 

Real U-boat crews did not need a vacation after a single mission. I like the graphics and the ability to use ""point of view"" of different crew members, but this is more like a simulator than a game, with constant moving crew men about and telling them to GO TO SLEEP, or order someone to turn on the air compressor because a single periscope dive drains the compressed air to nothing, 2-3 times before I can reach my destination. Shouldn't the crewmen know when it is time to sleep without me having to tell them? Can't someone figure out the air will drain unless the compressor turns on without hand-holding my ignorant crew? German U-boat crew men were supposed to be the ""cream of the crop"" as far as military recruits, and highly trained men - they were not mindless automatons. It's so much hand holding I'm surprised they don't force us to put crew into the toilet each day, although that might be a ""feature"" of a future patch for the sake of ""realism""!",1636908177,1636936937,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Once positive, once negative, now positive.
EARLY ACCESS game, but there is nothing to overtake this atm. Unless you mod extensively SH4 or SH5.

Lets go.
I had five to six large sessions among 3 different subs after a frustrating crew out of the boat glitch. The sessions were rock solid.

Things to take away: It is 50% of crew management of what I hoped it would be, and 70% of naval combat simulation I would wanted it to be.

A thing that bothers me is that hydrophone contacts are calculated on the minimap by not just bearing, but distance too. It should be just a bearing line, because passive tracking does not give distance calculations, just intensity. (Cold Waters AND Silent Hunter series did it right.). On U-Boat, you'll only need to open the map and the ships will be displayed in 3D inside the hydrophone range. Well.....that removes the distance estimation and calculation all together.

Low amount of different models of ships. It is Early Access and sure is coming in more and more content, but that's that.

I've been tracking this game way before early access hit, at first it was mesmerizing with lots of flaws, and then I waited for further baking. It went weird for a while but the devs pushed through some golden stuff into it. Now I'm digging it more thoroughly and normally issues arrived way too early but dissipated into a gameplay that shown to be solid.

Hats off to the effort on this, specially the not so recent update on world travel dynamics and lack of loading screens. 

Your GPU may suffer if it's along the GTX 1060 power band, but reducing frames takes NOTHING away from the experience and you can up the graphics on this phenomenal looking sim.

Graphics are the top of the food chain out there. Mechanics and ideas are very good and unique. Execution is in need of work that is being deployed.

Lack of patience almost got me to delete this game, but right now is one of my safe port to anchor when I get to loosen up on a simulation experience hunting down steel vessels from a couple of kilometers away.

Overall is good. I wished this was more fleshed out and more hardcore on simulation. I remember all the stuff we could do on Silent Hunter series to calculate ships path. On U-boat you get clicking areas conflicts and a more limited set of tools.

This is not a successor of Silent Hunter series. It is different. You can still feel like a hunter that uses silence as an ally.

Good to have and make some patrols. Not that great to study submarine tactics.

It is a long way to Tipperary.",1562675876,1636848771,True,5,0,0.563959002494812012,0,True,False,True

I'm seeing odd reviews from returning players to b129 & I think I see what's going on.  If you're returning, the game you knew on medium or hard is now the Care Bear setting of b129.  If you try to command like a Boss on the new semi or full experience modes without reading and learning crew schedules, new traits, and crew interactions - You're going to sink. You're not even going to make it back to port.  It will be a truly frustrating experience.  RTFM.

To people on the fence that were waiting for more content before putting down money:  b129 is what you were waiting for.

I would recommend it if you are willing to wait for the Devs to actually get the game to close to historically accurate, after all it is a simulation.

An example. I am playing on easiest mode. I am ordered to intercept a ship. no probs. exept my submarine travels at 17 knots on the surface and cannot intecept the convoy that motors past. Liberity ship which were the standard feighter of ww2 had max speed of 11 knots and many ships in convoys were slower. So I get in close to the convoy only to be attacked by half a dozen warships. So why did I get sunk, I assigned a guy to calculate torpedo runs and did not realise he had gone off to have a sleep, so I sat there waiting only to be sunk by a Flower class corvette.

One thing I really like about this game is that it's pretty realistic - or at least can be, depending on which settings you choose at the start. You can play on fully realistic simulator mode, you can have a very chill casual experience, or pretty much anything in between.

That's another bonus, there's a lot that you can change with the settings, some of which is completely inconsequential to gameplay and only there to add a bit of realism (such as switching distance measurements from km to nm), while others can have a huge impact on how the game works and all the things that you need to do.

The game also looks pretty great, I sometimes find myself just chilling in the ocean at normal speed and simply watching my u-boat, especially thunderstorms are pretty great to watch but there have also been some nice moments with sunset/sunrise and a very calm sea.

There are only very few bugs - I think I did encounter one minor bug once, but that was already some time ago and I can't even clearly remember what exactly it was. Must have been something extremely insignificant, since I didn't even bother to report it and I usually always do this if something disrupts the game flow even slightly.

The german translation is slightly lacking, but that is normal for games where the devs can't afford to hire two professional translators (one for the translation and a second one for proofreading). And considering the fact that it has all been done voluntarily by people from the community, it actually turned out quite well, certainly better than most other community translated games I've seen. So that's really only an issue if you want a 100 % perfect translation and absolutely can't settle for anything less. For me personally, I think I might actually switch the game back to german one day, cause the errors are really usually very small and pretty rare.

One actual criticism would be that when you play this game for the first time, the tutorial does a pretty good job of explaining the absolute basics but other more intricate things you'll have to figure out pretty much entirely on your own with the help of either google or the community.

Another small issue would be that the radio station (at least the one I always turn on, radio la rochelle), has only two tracks so it does get boring to listen to pretty soon. However, since you're not supposed to leave the radio running 24/7 anyway (any sort of noise can be pretty dangerous) that's also just a very minor issue.

So, in conclusion, starting at the average of 5, I'd give it +3 for the three positive things that I've mentioned (+1 point each), then I'd add another 1 without any other specific things that I particularly like, just because the game is overall really enjoyable, I'd give it - 1.5 for the three negative things that I've found (only -0.5 each because they're all very minor and not really much of an issue) and that brings the game up to a very decent 7.5/10. So I'd absolutely recommend buying it.",1635811456,1635811653,True,1,1,0.5,0,True,False,True

- deep experience, rich submarine modelling
- unbelievable graphics
- unlimited replayability
- none bugs or glitches encountered so far (yes, its early acces and there is zero issues, 0, nada, none!)
The only con is the additiveness and the ease with which you spend an hour playing. Go get this and find out for yourself. You have been warned.

-- Update after longer playtime --
There is a few glitches here and there, mostly AI operating both friendly and enemy ships, small bugs when displaying terraing. But still the game is very enjoyable and fun at the current state.

3rd edit: Back to a yes with advisories..

1) Dig out your patience, you'll need it. You WILL need to spend time watching some how to videos. One of the active forum members, has put together a superb video on the in game crew management system. That 15 or so minutes of my life, changed the entire game for me, from an impending nightmare to 90% functional and pretty enjoyable experience.
2) ACCEPT that his game is still a WIP. It WILL change. There are thing that work well, and there are things that work not so well. If you are not prepared to accept that, then wait until the game is finished.
3) This is a UBOAT game. UBOAT means by definition, a German sub. No, you cant play as an American. Quit asking. America had a grand total of 6 subs in the entire Atlantic campaign.

Yes, there is micromanagement here. LOTS of it. I dont much care for that part and courtesy of the excellent Crew Management video, I have managed to largely automate crew functions so, I dont have to deal with that to terribly much. I primarily concern myself with combat and logistic management, and navigation.

If you want a good sub sim, this is going to be one. It's OK now, and getting better.",1606634342,1634535791,True,1,1,0.456878960132598877,0,True,False,True

494840,82791490,76561199058987626,41,2,3599,0,528,1695770258,"This is a great game. There is definitely a learning curve to it. It took me a while to figure thing out, getting out of port, actually moving, torpedoing, using the deck gun. But once you get past that it's actually pretty fun. Torpedoing is hard and there is definitely quite a bit of guessing when it comes to launching them at a ship. I can see why people have a hard time with it and end up not liking it, it is a rather slow paced game when it comes to trying to sink ships and especially trying to sink a single ship in a large convoy. It is a little bit fiddly when it comes to getting your crew to do what you want them to do, but it's not unplayable. One of the only things I wish that it did have was a walk though of the ship and have it show you all of the modules (water pump, air compressor, etc.)
TLDR; It's a good game, but there's a learning curve. If you are willing to spend some time trying to figure things out I say go for it. But if you want to open the game and understand how things work right away, this is probably not the game for you. And it have a tutorial beyond showing how to restock.

(I will probably add on to this later)

Been waiting for the game to get more and more polished with more content. Finally decided to buy Uboat and try a few days ago. 

Knew before buying from reading reviews that this was not a typical sub game, rather focused on some of the more strategic aspects (including crew management).

Got to say, love this strategic change in a sub game and I have played every sub game on PC since GATO in the 1980's was released.

All the good said, need to outline the shade of this Uboat game:

--The 1 tactical simulator thing that drives me crazy is no compass or compass direction controls.

--The crew management should be more fleshed out:
     --Skills for enlisted(not as robust as officers, but something!)
     --Need for water
     --Need for bathroom
     --Need for shower
     --Interpersonal communications (something like RimWorld, but a light version)
Was just really hoping for ""more"" crew management aspect, this was one of things really enjoyed with SH4.

Things in Uboat that just KILLS the immersion factor for me:
     1. NO COMPASS
     2. ""Blue light"" is as close to ""silent running"" going to get, but when blue light is running the torpedo officer continues to perform torpedo maintenance and crew sweeps floor also. No, just no. This is simple coding fix for devs, dev's could fix in 1 hour.
     3. Torpedo reload seems way too fast compared to real life. (I know there is a mod)

Watching depth charges knock out the last of the lights in my sub while my crew desperately try to block the leaks and repair the ballast pumps, all the while hearing the enemy sonar getting closer? That's when it got my attention.

This game is amazing. If you choose to play on the realistic settings, you simply cannot make mistakes. The enemy AI is ruthless, and like the real war, they will radio your position and destroyers will hunt you down with sonar and depth charges you until your best sailors are crying for their mothers. Compartments will flood. Men will drown. You will hit mines, submarine nets. But the enemy can be outsmarted if you're a good Skipper. Tactics are endless, it's up to you to command the vessel.

And if you somehow, against all odds, manage to make it out alive, sometimes the best part of this game is just watching the boat cruising back towards land with all your guys up top enjoying the fresh air.

For example: The alarm goes off on the u-boat and a voice says ""everybody to their stations!"", but the crew still just continue on doing their scheduled tasks as if nothing was going on. Instead you have to manually select each person and send them to their stations, but this will not prevent them from returning to their schedule (i.e. SLEEP) at the most inconvenient of moments. The only way to get around this seems to be to constantly change the schedule, which is cumbersome as fuck.

If you´ve never played subsims before, I recommend you go watch youtube videos, gameplay or tutorials, to see if this type of game is something youd enjoy. Why ? Because you travel long distances (but you can warp time) where most of the time nothing happens. You hunt cargo ships do some (very simplified) math to sink ships and avoid death by depth charge, keeping your uboat as silent as possible while YOU become the hunted one. Travel back home, refuel, rearm at base, buy food for your crew, take them on vacations, upgrade your boat and keep it nice well maintained.

Also every aspect of logistics, from fuel, food, and even drinking water, is accurately represented.  Sailing at sea has very realistic combat including a relatively easy to learn manual targeting system, something which no other submarine game has yet to achieve.

With that said, and with the game recommended, I am probably going to take a break to allow early access to expire and maybe come back in one to two years and play the game then.  Some major updates need to happen, in particular:
1) More ports with accurate landscape and scenery.  Submarine pens have been promised and really need to be added to the game
2) Major expansion of the United States east coast.  New York at present is an empty harbor with no scenery which can be entered with no opposition.  Statue of Liberty as scenery and U.S. Coast Guard defenses need to be added.
3) No real advancement for the crew or the ability to award the crew medals.  This is a minor issue, since you can promote the crew to become chiefs and officers (something other games don't allow) but crew recognition would be a bonus
4) There are no ranks in the game at all.  The ability to start the war as a Leutenant, and advance up to higher grades, would be a real bonus.
5) Lastly, and this is a tall order, instead of locking the player to a Type VII for the entire war, expand the game to include the Type II, IX, and XXI.  This was what made Silent Hunter III such an excellent game and would make this game extraordinary as well

There's two way this can go: either the game will finally provide info on the management part of the game and there's actual things to manage under the current messy/blurry state of things OR there's just nothing to work with and it's all glitter and fluff. It's been on EA since 2019 and it's now 2021, so it's already gone one of the two ways, and it's not pretty. Is there some actual numbers behind what's going on with the crew?

- How much time does a regular sailor need to rest?
- How long can a shift be at max?
- 18 Sailors, 3 shifts, 6 sailors per shift => Why are only 4 sailors working?
- How much food per sailor per day?
- Where does that ""too much work from officers"" morale debuff come from?
- Why is it going up or down +3 or +1 seemingly randomly by the minute?
- Why do I learn about the benefits of the different inside lighting on a random loading page tip?
- Why can't my dedicated mechanic officer repair a hole in the hull just because a random sailor is already working on it at an alarmingly slow pace?

There so much the game won't explain and I am afraid that's just because there's nothing to explain and it's all fluff. Here, the tutorial part called ""crew management"" won't even deal with managing the crew, preferring to explain how to launch a torpedo in automatic mode instead.

Also, -CLICK- there's a whole tutorial part -CLICK- dedicated to buying potatoes.-CLICK- A very annoying one at that, -CLICK- that makes you click through tens of pop ups -CLICK- only to explain -CLICK- this very simple thing: -CLICK- ""Merchant -> click and drag to inventory"" -CLICK- 
What about a tutorial part about using the map tools to manually set the torpedoes instead? (with no annoying pop ups to click away.)

The game will crash if you try to load back in to a save that was during the tutorial(s).  I have found so far that once you're beyond the tutorials, manually saving at regular intervals into new slots seems to be stable, and resuming to an autosave appears to be stable.  This needs to be fixed though, as tutorials are probably what new players will experience first.

I am really starting to enjoy the game. I've sunk countless ships as a fledgling captain, and almost created an international incident by sinking a Spanish ship carrying tea.  The new features to stop and inspect neutral ships look super interesting, but there's no tutorial or specifics on how this is to be accomplished, so I haven't figured this out.  It's interesting doing research, leveling officer skills and keeping the ship running and away from prying enemy eyes. 

I think some additional improvements could be made, especially concerning event triggers. For example, when submerged, I want my Coms officer to switch to Listening instead of Radio. Or when surfacing, it would be useful to have an engineering officer automatically tasked to run the compressor instead of having to scroll around the ship and direct him every time, especially when repetitively surfacing, hunting, periscope, listen, run silent, then surfacing over and over at 1800 time multiplier.  

I see where the schedule and task management is going, but it's not a smooth operation. Officers don't always do the right things first. For example, I want an officer to navigate but only when navigation is going below say, 65%. Otherwise, use the binoculars. What's confusing is Torpedo loading/maintenance/both tasks.  When running at 140X speed, I noticed I can order a mechanic to perform maintenance, but then when I check again the maintenance level of the torpedoes has dropped to 1/3 and I keep repeating the maintenance thinking it should fix the thing. Seems like there's a bug in this area.

Overall the game is fun and I like the detail. It's pretty interesting to figure out how and when to go full steam ahead to catch a target or stalk it for days without losing air or getting detected.",1631766891,1632163047,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

[h3]This game is incredibly fun. It shows you most of the rungs and nooks of the WWII Kriegsmarine UBoat Sailors; one of the most volatile yet powerful weapons Germany had at her disposal during the war. You are in charge of the officers, sailors and the U-Boat as you do tasks around the globe to assist in the war effort. [/h3]

[b] [u] - Wage the silent battles; [/u] [/b] sink enemy vessels with torpedoes after acquiring a torpedo targeting solution; manually or automatically. Use the Deck gun to finish them off or ward off encroaching aircraft with the mounted machine gun.

[b] [u] - Command the crew of a Type VII U-Boat; [/u] [/b] The lives of your officers and sailors depend on your decisions. Carry out maintenance, repairs, manning of stations such as the hydrophone or periscope, or have the officers cheer up the crew with a game of cards or a bountiful meal. Upgrade your U-Boat using reward funds to increase the combat effectiveness of your vessel, or use the funds to send your crew on a well-deserved vacation to keep them sane.

[b] [u] - Manage supplies; [/u] [/b] Including Torpedoes, ammunition, food, fuel and the less-commercial ones such as crew discipline, and of course, oxygen.

I've been with it since they first released it as early access and had very low expectations, really just wanted a Silent Hunter remaster, nothing fancy.  One of the major problems that anyone thinking of buying this game should know is that when they say early access, they mean EARLY access.  I've worked my way to near the end of the war three times only to have a new version release and render those saves useless.  I get that it's early access, but this seems to be a particular issue with these devs.  It's particularly rough here because the early game is a slog.  The middle part of the game seems fine.  I can't comment on the endgame because the devs keep resetting my progress before I make it that far.

The latest release (as of Sept. 2021) seems to just completely break the game.  Crew members go missing and when you zoom to them, they seem to be stuck in the tail of the ship.  Enemy ships spot you miles before you can spot them, meaning you spend a good chunk of your time at low depths trying not to die which is just as fun and interesting as it sounds.  Whether you do is completely random, by the way, sometimes the enemy crews give up, sometimes they break out their crystal ball and the whole thing feels like a waste of my time.  The actual targets are now harder to find and harder to hit, the torpedoes fail way more often and way more randomly, and there are no options or sliders or settings that fix it.  

The game used to be buggy but playable and perfectly fine.  The devs keep releasing updates that break old saves and this latest release makes the game kinda suck.  The best way to sum it up is that it used to be fun to play this game and now it's not very much fun anymore.",1631496961,1631496961,False,2,2,0.504976809024810791,0,True,False,True

[b] [u] I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME!! [/u] DOWNLOAD SH5 WITH WOLVES OF STEEL MOD FOR A BETTER EXPERIENCE. [/b]

I want to review my analysis of this game. I purchased it in the first hour when released, I also followed its development before the release. After a long time that I purchased it, it feels like slow progress. The game has been developed somewhat but not that enough. The idea of the game is excellent but poorly implemented. It is a good game and the effort to create an u-boat management game is great. 

But after really playing it, I am still disappointed. Because at the current stage, the game is still and feels poorly optimized. Its graphics and mechanics aren't that impressive, yet it requires a lot from the GPU. After tons of bug corrections, there're bugs and slow performance on my computer. It seems that despite the developer's effort, the game still and feels stuck. The time travel is still poorly optimized. The navigation system isn't good for me, personally, I prefer something like Silent Hunter 5 system, which is more organic and you know where the boat is and what is doing. Another point is that the missions feel empty of purpose, they're like SH5, e.g., ""go to the area such, destroy such tonnage"". The missions are still silly. The AI is also very strange like SH5, it needs more improvement. The contact with the BdU is very strange, they don't respond as realistic, there are just 1 or 2 options to contact the HQ. When you have an alarm situation, the crew does not get in silence, like in SH5. There is no ""silence mode"" in the game, at least I could not find it.

The game would be much better if it was in the first-person view, and if you gave the officers some orders in dialogues and they kept following what you said to them. If you could plan and change their workload and schedules. Also, you could plan the Alarm situations and plan the training so that morale could increase and also which training would increase each crewman's abilities and new abilities. There would be also some missions to train new captains or new NCOs. 

But in reality, the crew just wants to sleep and they also seem dumb people, you have to tell them each time to do their own jobs. They don't act like trained officers of the Kriegsmarine. You have to stop your focus in some attacks just to tell people to do silly tasks that could be automated. Just as a [b] The Sims [/b] gameplay!!! 

Every time I play this game I feel disappointed, it has no purpose, is not fun, and consumes a lot of your time to do NOTHING because the missions have no purpose at all even dough been ""inspired"" on real missions!!! Mainly because in the next update your save will be incompatible and you have to start a new one.",1609319367,1631412760,False,1,2,0.510674178600311279,2,True,False,True

Reviewed early access  B118 version.

Good
- The proposed balance between simulation and strategy is great to appeal to a mass audience whilst allowing some more simulation detail for the more hardcore sim players, like manual targeting.
- Graphical detail is fantastic. Uboat is well detailed of course, sea, wave, wake and weather looks tremendous.
- Map view is easy to control and plot courses. 
- The ability to zoom in all the way from map view to look at both your Uboat and enemy ships, even visibly track torpedoes all the way to target (calm sea during the day of course) is truly astounding. I think this is my favourite single element of the whole game.
- Involvement with the boat and the crew is excellent. Makes you feel like you are controlling the major aspects with the crew you want without too much micro management of everything. 


Bad
 - Game breaking save and load problems. Saves either take forever, result in a CTD or worse yet can be corrupted if you CTD during load. An existing committed user generated save should be inviolate and only be written to be the user in the form of a delete or an overwrite. The best workaround I've found is to ONLY save when you are in open sea fast travel mode, likely reduced environment content to save so reduces the risk of the above.
 - Graphics performance. Unplayable for me at 1920 and had to drop to 1280 x 800 to get anything like a usable frame rate. I have GEForce 780M with 32GB main RAM so some of this could well be my end.

I've only got the two main gripes above. I recognise this is early access so the occasional crashes, balancing bugs and gameplay features that don't quite work are all perfectly understandable at this stage so they aren't raised as bad.


Conclusion
    I really wanted to say Yes to Uboat as it will be a Yes once nearer completion as the game will be excellent but right now at this stage of Early Access its a No. 
    Uboat will frustrate a lot of people right now, myself included, with the inability to recover game state after a crash or other bug from corrupted saves and worse you lose any feeling of making any progress due to this.
    A reliable state recovery mechanism aka save and load is absolutely critical to any application and this isn't there so it generates the No right off the bat.

If you are even remotely interested in subs or naval games then this is one to come back to in a few months as I think it will be the best thing since sliced bread at that point.


EDIT: 27/05/19 version b120
 
  The save issue looks to have fixed. in b119 according to the release notes. I've hammered the save and load a fair bit in b120 and its reliability and performance is much improved.
  b119 and b120 have added a number of other fixes.
  Performance is better for me. I can reload the deck guns properly now...yaaah. Also the friendly sub boat missions seems much less glitchy than before with the returning crew member not getting stuck on the dive planes and the multiple dialog triggers that I was getting also apparently much better now.


  I'm more than happy to change to a positive recommendation with the same recognition that this is in early access. Get your Das Boot DVD's refresh in and show old Prochnow how its done. :)",1557827886,1631141282,True,0,0,0.497630327939987183,0,True,False,True

But...
The UBOAT Wiki is essentially useless.  Seems to be an Advert for sponsors.  Really?  Check out the Wiki and be bombarded with adds while searching for useless info and then, oh no, here comes another add.  Was trying to pull up using the deck gun... no entry available.  What?
Now.. my main peev.  The ALARM! ALARM!  The *(*^)_ ALARM.Why can't it stay turned off when an officer turns it off.  I even downloaded the alarm mod (it helps a little).NO WAY a skipper will keep it blaring away for every allied destroyer to hear it on sonar.  Remember 'run silent, run deep'?  That reminds me.. why no silent running cmd?
I would recommend a limited time of crew stress as they man their combat stations.  Not constant.  For a 'Silent Running' cmd I would recommend 1/2 crew stress vs ALARM/battle stations.  After all, Alarm reps the initial stress which may dissipate over time and successful attacks.  Silent running stress would probably not as the crew is essentially in an 'iron coffin' mode hoping to elude one or more allied warships.  Ok?
Next, what's with all the rubber boats with 5hp Evinrudes ( or other brands) motors when allied ship crews abandon ship?  Only the actual life boat (and not all of them) had an inboard motor.  Sooo....why don't the crews use the actual life boats?  Plus, why, after abandoning ship, do they stay next to the sinking ship?  Do they have a death wish to be sucked down along with the ship?
Oh.. I hate the ALARM syatem.  Must be a mutinous sailor who keeps turning it back on just to mess with the skipper.  There is no threat.the allied ship is dead in the water and slowly sinking (highly rec sinking physics). Sub is submerged and 2km away.
So... Awesome game, hope the devs or an incredible modder can fix the peevs I listed.  Plus a huge thank you to the Devs for facilitating the modding community.  Modders rock!

Have fun, I am!

Well it seems update B129 fixed the 2 peevs I was ranting about above *ALARM and lifeboats).  Awesome!!!
Is B129 really stable?  Pretty much.  It only crashed once in the past 6 hours of game play.
I like this update a lot.  Have yet to check the Uboat Wiki yet (should I?).
Great job devs!
Did have to turn off all the mods listed above.  But most seem to have been incorporated into the B129 update.  Hope the mod authors got some recompense.

This is not a linear game, you don't have to rush battles as the ships are slow. You can take your time, be stealth or decide to face head to head with a destroyer. The programming and features are nothing short of amazing how maps can go from 2D into 3D when you zoom, the inside of the sub, turning on the radio. Cracking codes. I mean this game IS WWII. Every part of it seems well done and they really went overboard (no pun intended) with all the extras.

You can save your torpedos and use deck guns for easy kills or you can play realistically and search boats and inspect papers. If the lie and are smuggling you can decide to steal, sink or let them go. All the tools work too. You can pull up a periscope and calculate your torpedo paths by hand if you so desire. 

The game also seems endless. I wonder if I am even contributing to the war effort. There are so many different locations and I love how they let you do what you want and not try to force a plan upon you. You can decide what skills to bring, upgrade and what missions or jobs you want to do and there is no rush or timer to get back home that will penalize you. 

They really did a good job with reporting issues, you just need to hit the F11 key and select what the issue is, or even a suggestion and you can even send the current state of the game or a previous save if you want to. I mean so many things I havent mentioned like using the free camera to see planes shoot missles at your sub or drop depth charges while you just sit back and watch from any camera angle/free camera you want. You can also follow your torpedo under water if your skilled enough with the free camera. 

I think the reason for bad reviews is just getting started. I have been gaming for 35 years and I had some issues at the beginning with making sense of it but they continue to release updates for improvement. 

I love being able to surface for a sunset or dive deep for cover. It really is whatever you want it to be. I stock loaded up 4 deck guns and just decided to go after aircraft which probably isnt what the developer was expecting people to do but had a blast trying new things.

I've really enjoyed every aspect and hope they add more features, upgrades, ships, and functions. I would like to see crew personalities, problems and more events. More research projects, more crew and even bigger U-boats would be awesome to see added in. I would like to see the promotion system implemented with the ability to create ranking tiers among the crew. What is the point of being able to promote a crew member when I have a full compliment of officers already? Please add in manual alarms and quiet running mode.

 I've been only playing the unstable version, which is well....unstable. I have had multiple game breaking bugs and some that are not so bad. Crew will get stuck in their positions, not follow orders and currently my ship is glitched and spinning in the water.  Luckily for me so is the enemy. The crew assignments bugs out constantly and will at times leave you with no one doing anything. No matter if the dive controls are electric or manual the ship enters and exits periscope depth and deck awash constantly. This causes your targets to be lost and the crew to get confused on operations. Despite the numerous glitches, bugs, and multiple restarts, the game is quite enjoyable. 

A couple annoying issues I see with the game so far. Guns on deck can only be manned by a Leader. If the leader is manning the guns then you lose them on observation. I assume this is a mechanic but it doesn't make sense. I would like to see the crew be able to man the guns when topside so that the officers can do other functions.  There simply isn't enough crew in my opinion. I would like to see the ability to expand to a different ship later so that I could add more crew and officers to the roster. Another request would be to cut down the transmission of the technical officer. Yes, I know the ships are still there! The tech officer reports the same ships every five seconds which leads me to want to load him into the torpedo tube and send him on a viking funeral. Target acquisition is painfully slow. I understand that it takes calculations but shouldn't take hours for those to finally come through.

I'm quite jaded of WWII themed media, being inundated with it since I was a child, and noticing recently that it has been in continuous, sometimes serial production since the time it was actually going on... 75-81 years ago as of writing this review. UBOAT manages what most games cannot. Bringing a WWII specific subject to a game in a way that interests me, and allowing me to explore it freely. I DO have my criticisms, for example, the methods of ranging can be quite difficult to manage if you can't precisely find the waterline of ships. In rough seas, it can be overly easy to glitch and penetrate the surface, giving your position away. And when shooting at stationary targets, the stopwatch for measuring speed must be allowed to run on for a very long time, as the game seemingly has no method built in with firing at stationary targets in mind.",1629623553,1629623553,True,1,0,0.482981890439987183,0,True,False,True

I am not sure I would say that in its current state it is worth full price, however it is good to see that the game is actively being worked on an is being improved. 

Lets first go through the aspects of the game I enjoyed. I thoroughly appreciate the customized difficulty of the game as well, allowing me to make the game as casual or hardcore as I desire; which is a particularly good feature as I do not often have much time to game. I also enjoy the overall atmosphere of the game and how authentic it feels to play. It's as if I am playing Das Boot, especially with mod that replaces the in-game soundtrack with the soundtrack from both the movie and series. Speaking of mods, the game also has a good, albeit small, modding community that is doing wonders for the game already in its current state.

With all of the positives out of the way, the game is not without flaws. There are several bugs and tedious tasks that I hope are resolved in due time. For example, some ports are difficult to plot a course to and often result in damage to your boat and injury as the AI decided to charge straight into a pier. 

In all, I would recommend this game on sale in its current state. Even on sale, I would say that I am getting my money's worth out of the game and have enjoyed every second that I have put into it.",1629009426,1629009426,True,10,0,0.640204370021820068,0,True,False,True

Not like it's a grind or I want to progress etc, although it is mighty satisfying going from 5 officers and a basic type 7 C at the start of your commission where you still might struggle a little to manage everything and keep everyone happy(as discipline and energy drain can be a pain at the start) but as you go on patrols and get upgrades for your uboat, it starts performing better and better whether it be through engine upgrades, hydrophone upgrades etc...

Great modding support and theres mods in there that more or less suit anyones style, whether you want the game to be a little more forgiving and arcadeish or whether you want to make it a little more difficult or more realistic.

Does require some patience as a patrol may take you a few hours but time compression tools are available to help with this, you'll have to manage your crew's energy, discipline, food supply and all the ship systems to keep you busy anyway ;). However when you finally get that hydrophone contact or Chimney Smoke on the Horizon it's game on as you try to Intercept the convoy, god forbid you race in at full speed and there's destroyers or all the hard work tracking that convoy may be for nothing as you will be forced to dive to almost crush depth and listen to the destroyers circling overhead pinging you with sonar dropping depth charges the whole time. But if you do manage to intercept said convoy, there's nothing more satisfying than when you hit a ship with a torpedo and a minute or so later the cargo just explodes, the ship is literally gone in a matter of minutes, very nice to watch.

I say ""looks likely"" only due to the fact that this game is still very much in early access, and as others have mentioned suffers from bugs that - at present - make campaign gameplay virtually impossible. Having said that, the devs (DWS) are updating it on a weekly basis, and the game has assistance from an enthusiastic community which has developed mods reaching from simple on-off switches for alarms, to historically accurate fixes for flags, goods, vacations, and even propeller noises.

Positives:
1. Outstanding graphics and attention to detail, especially during torpedo attacks;
2. enjoyable and diverse gameplay and immersive historical experience;
3. simple to play initially yet difficult enough to make it worth learning some of the minutiae of crew management;
4. hard-working devs with attention to detail and a great community for mods.

Negatives:
1. Two years on from the initial release date, this game is still in early access.
2. Bugs on the latest version can induce madness.

Overall recommendation: If you are a big fan of simulator games, WWII, naval combat (...or have ever watched Das Boot), this game is well worth the price in early access - join the community, submit your bug reports, and help make the game better and better. If you are easily frustrated by bugs and want something polished, pop it on your wishlist, wait a few months and check back in again, I am confident that DWS will make it well worth the wait.

I know the response I'll get - you need to go on line for proper tutorials. But why? Why do we accept this from people who are charging us money for their product? Stop hiding behind ""Early Access"" disclaimers as an excuse for shoddiness. I don't believe that you are genuinely using the gaming community to help you create a great product. I believe you are creaming off a bit of extra cash. If you release a game at least have the decency to give proper hints on how to play it!

For example, installing Nvidia drivers can cause the game to crash to desktop when loading any saved game. Preventing you from playing the game till the dev's figure out a workaround. FYI, the dev's have known about this problem back in 2019.  Prior to updating to new Nvidia drivers that caused this crash I still had the problem of saved games crashing my computer to desktop if I had the audacity to save a game while the u-boat was at sea  Leading me to have to complete entire missions   and even then every time I loaded a saved game in port I held my breath.

The game even crashes when using the crew management window, and is a massive resource hog with both memory and CPU usage.  Apart from the driver issues here are some annoying other bugs that the dev's haven't addressed to date:

Ships not rendering when near them in light fog - by near I mean 100 metres distance.
Game can inexplicably freeze causing you to lose the U.I. interface.
Recently I also found my sonar man was not reporting contacts within a few hundred metres of the sub when submerged.

If these problems aren't enough I am also experiencing normal crew raising the periscope when submerged. It staggers me that it did not occur to the developers that this is a big no-no in the navy and would endanger the whole crew and lead to court martial or discharge from the navy.

Only after playing this piece would one understand how fabulous Silent Hunter games are. Even tho they are already more than 10 years old.

Some terrible designs:
0. bugs. after a certain time, all (merchant) ships in my game are invisible, no matter how close they are. only their smoke is visible. this bug compels me to make this review
1. trivial and troublesome management of crews with little significance
 1.1 things like reloading/warming torps should never be tied to player's crew management
2. charging compressed air, hydroing, fueling, as well as a heck lot other things should have been automatic
3. manual control for aiming is practically impossible. and I can do that perfectly in SH
 3.1 like, it takes forever to rotate the periscope or binoculars
4. time compression system is terrible compared to SH. can't accelerate even tho there's only friendly land around
5. how tf can the destroyers SEE me before I see them, on surface?
6. auto-aiming is so slow. it would take 3 min to get the calculation done for a stationary target
7.8.9.10 this game is not built with the intention to facilitate the player, unlike SH. there are a million minor things that make the players feel inconvenient but it would be too sissy to bring them up. like, it takes 2 seconds to zoom in/out on the sub, to show how ""beautiful"" the sub is.

-Torpedoes, this system is the single most annoying thing about this game for me. Say you want to outfit your boat with only the best torpedoes? Well the system is absolutely stupid.

You research new torpedoes to finally get rid of that awful T1. Well you can't get rid of T1 because the game doesn't actually spawn enough new model torpedoes to outfit your boat. So you load a mix of T1/T2/T3/T5. Now you wait in harbor until they are loaded. Once they are loaded you go back to the harbormaster and see that the game now spawned more of the torpedoes you want. So now you unload the bad ones (T1/T2), and load the good ones (T3/T5) and wait again for loading/unloading. Now you have to repeat the step above for around 6 times until your boat is outfitted with the torpedoes you want, while skipping 1-3 days each time. 

I mean, is this done for some realism reason to model industrial production limitations? There is a fine line between realism, and annoying BS. This system needs to be thrown out the window. The harbor torpedo composition should be 90% new researched stuff, 10% free garbage torpedoes. Or better yet, add a priority list, where a player can select which kind of torpedo/pistol combination they prefer to get spawned in. I don't give a rats ass if this is not ""ReALisTic"".

-Why can't my sailor on radio send reports, only an officer on radio can do that. Is this a feature or a bug? If this is a feature then get rid if this annoying BS asap. This adds nothing to gameplay value, having to move an officer from radar to radio, then back to radar just to receive/send a message. Why add 8 mouse clicks just for something this basic?

-More controls need to be added to the TAB menu, like the ability to send an engineer to warm all torpedoes at once starting with Tube 1 instead of clicking each one.",1626518773,1626518773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Having been a fan of Silent Hunter 3 and later SH5, which I can't get to run properly now on Windows 10, I decided to try out Uboat, to see if it was gong to be as good as SH3 with the Grey Wolves add on mod.
 
I bought Uboat quite a while ago now, when it was in very early development, but could not get to grips with it with All the bugs and glitches, you seem to get with all early access games, was making it difficult for me to enjoy, so I uninstalled it But now, twelve months on, I have give it another go. 

Although it plays differently to the SH games and focuses more on crew management, than the SH style of play, it does have a lot going for it as far as enjoyment is concerned and plays like a proper Submarine sim should play. 

What I really love about this game is the fact that you actually feel as though you are part of the crew itself, as the Captain in charge of the rest of the officers and men aboard your Type VII Uboat. No more lifeless crew on this Sub, or frozen machinery, everything moves as it should do on a Uboat game, from crew members carrying out the their duties, to the movement of the Diesel Engines and Torpedoes being loaded and lots lots more. The whole boat is alive, with the whole crew, going about their jobs, eating meals, resting or even going to the loo, the whole boat is alive and you are part of it playing this game.

Let me say a little about the devs (Deep Water Studios) who are making this game. They have constantly been updating the game ever since its release and are continuously updating it every month or so. They listen to the community, not like Ubisoft and other massif game studios, who are just after your cash, rather than improving on getting their games fit for purpose. The devs of this game are doing their best to get a fully workable game ready for its final release from Early Access status, to a decent playable game.
There are also a growing number of Mods available for this game, done by the community, here on the Steam Workshop, which greatly improve some of the game play and helps to make the game more appealing, to those who are not skilled at modding, like me Lol. So thank you all you game modders.

Graphically, this game is beautiful, throughout the whole game and it looks real too. Proper dynamic weather, realistic sea and gorgeous skies and sunsets, you just feel as though you are out there with them when playing the game.

It has a long learning curve and can be difficult to grasp how best to play the game, as there is so much in this game, you need to know, to get to play it properly. There is a tutorial in game, but this does not go deep enough to cover all this game has to offer, just the basics really to get you going. However, there are lots of tutorials on Steam and Youtube, that will make things a bit clearer and help you get started.

There are a few things, I have yet to learn about this game, but I can honestly say that it is enjoyable, to say the least, as far as I am concerned. I have lost quite a few subs whilst playing this and sent all my crew to a watery grave, bur have also had successes and sent quite a few ships to the bottom as well. So if you have not yet tried this game, please do so, as it is one of the best Uboat games ever made so far, since the days of SH.

I only bought this game from watching someone play on stream and it looked like it was in a much better state (I guess they were playing the beta?), because I was originally holding out on getting this one due to how bad the mechanics/ui/etc looked.  Feel kind of baited.  If the developers are insistent that players have to micro their crew so much (which seems to be thing that players will spend most of their time on), they really need to make the reassignment process, etc. easier.  Using the scroll wheel to try to view the other sections of the ship just doesn't work given the shape of some of the subs.  When I try to zoom out to get the con tower in view with everything else it just takes everything away from me and put me at the surface view.

I took a while to meditate on this one, as at first it was pretty unapproachable due to no solid tutorial.

What you have is a pretty solid sim that is not going to unseat Silent Hunter 3, but is by far superior to anything post-SH3. There is a lot to fiddle with, and some of it is kind of annoying. Like, do I really want to have to worry about the bilge? Why? Why can't that sort of automatically be handled by my crew, and I can worry about listening to sonar/radio and plotting torpedo courses. I would much rather watch convoys go boom than discover that Rolfe, Hans, and Dieter are incapacitated because I didn't surface to allow fresh air to cycle into the vessel since there was too much water in the bilge and it was weighing us down. Sorry, guys, I thought you were watching out for that? Also, I shouldn't have to download a mod to make that horribly annoying 'dong' of the ships bell go away every time it reaches a way point.

I'm still getting to grips with how to complete missions after putting in a lot of hours. I've killed many crews because I stayed at periscope depth too long and got pounded by depth charges, I've been unable to repair damage quick enough and the boat has been crushed when it sank too deep too quick.

Its a dramatic learning curve, each mission is different, you learn to equip your officers with rebreathers, you fill their pockets with spares and first aid kits, change the torpedo loadouts because early fish are often duds that dont explode!

Watching the target view whilst torpedo approaches gives you some fantastic moments, as you blow the ship up out of the water!

Silent Hunter 3 is probably the most memorable submarine sim most people think of, but this takes it to the stage we wish we could all have done, take on the roles of the men running the ship. You can take on the role of watch officer on the sail, you can be the chief engineer looking after his diesels or electric engines, you can be a torpedo mechanic and load the tubes with the torpedoes, you can be a radio or sonar operator, its given lots of possibilities.

Sneaking into Scapa Flow undetected to blow up British warships has got to be one of the most nerve wracking missions I've done here. You try and sneak into the harbour after having sent a reconnaissance flight when you leave port to map out the defences and submarine nets, mines, artillery.

After days at sea your crew is already at low morale, so sneaking in after a day of praying nobody spots us from the air as we sit on the bottom next to the net at entrance to harbour makes it very atmospheric. A man panics so you send a officer to knock him out or calm him down, you slowly change depth and raise periscope, its dark so its time to try and get the sub up and over the net and sneak in.

After a few attempts we get clear and quickly submerge,  we dare not risk using the snorkel in case its picked up on the early radars of the destroyers. Batteries charged, start the electric motors, we slip closer to the moorings at 3 knots. Sighting destroyers, sonarman, chief of the boat and watch officer are all watching and listening to get the target bearings matched. Firing tubes 1 thru 4 at targets causes your world to ignite! 

Out of the darkness fast torpedo boat patrols, corvettes, and more destroyers appear trying to find you, will you survive to escape?.... 

If the developers read this, extend the missions to allow playing a non-commissioned submarine crew member would allow someone to help patch a hole, or lend a hand to allow torpedoes to be loaded quicker, or even get everyone forward to make the submarine dive faster!

This in itself is a good thing, as the game is alive and kicking, and the community is on the whole constructive and pretty well informed on how u-boots worked and fought historically so it's a good combination. 

I've gone back to SH V to see what that's like and UBOAT is slowly catching up with SH V and I am hoping will overhaul it in the next 12 months.

 At the time of writing, UBOAT still lacks certain reality aspects - eg your hydrophone plots on the game map show all the ships, direction, etc, so you can make torpedo launched from below periscope depth based on hydrophone data alone. However the crew management, damage control and manual torpedo attack systems are great. 

There's no TDC as per SH III or SH IV to mess with, but if you like mods, there is an active modding community that has bling like this to add to your vanilla game.

The visuals are great. The convoy hunting feels awesome. Sub management is not too tedious and can be fun.

If the escorts ever bother to chase you, their depth chargers are laughably ineffective and you can just swim away - oxygen ending? Just use the ventilators for a minute.

But unfortunately there's a few reasons why i cannot.  Everything started out great.  I played through the tutorials because it seemed like a game that is hard to figure out how to play without some kind of tutorial.  So me and the crew were doing great.  We went on a few patrols and managed to save up 50k.  Well i decided to work one of the deck guns and shoot a freighter and happened to get too close to the freighter and while i was shooting it the upper deck exploded and killed me while i was running the gun.  So basically i killed myself the skipper/captain.  No big deal right.  I promoted my chief boatswain (first mate) to skipper since he had been with the crew since the beginning.  Now for some reason i get a message saying I cant leave dock without a skipper and that i should promote one of my officers to skipper which i already did and it wont let me promote any of them now because i already and did and the game isn't recognizing it.  So that game is effed up now.  Ok 50k down the drain.  So i thought.....I'll give it another chance and start a new game but this time ill try a different U-boat maybe that will increase my chances of a good experience.  So I chose the second u-boat and because i already knew how to play the game i chose the hardest mission that was available which was to sneak into an english port and sink two ships of  corvette size or larger.  I made it all the way into the port and got within 300 meters of 2 destroyers whick i fired torpedoes at and hit both but it wasn't showing that i hit them on the damage bar then all hell breaks loose and i get sunk.  There is too many glitches in this game.  If this game was polished it would definitely be my favorite game right now.

This is a submarine sim that tries to do better than Silent Hunter and just doesn’t succeed.  If you want a Silent Hunter game then buy Silent Hunter.  This game has a potential to be that, but they are a long ways from being there.

Let’s talk good:

Amazing MANUAL torpedo shot setup.  This is the one item that is very well done.  You get to estimate range, speed, and angle on the bow.  Just an A+ in this one area.

Non-combat Navigation- Excellent all around.

Graphics are very good.  Just, geeze, its 2020 can’t they be better?

The ease of and understanding of what you are doing in port?  Well, done, except for crew assignments.  Crew assignments are bewildering and you only get to find out if you messed up when you are at sea and can’t correct them.

 The bad:

The ONLY people that work on the boat are your four officers and of them only two can work repairs (mechanics).  The enlisted crew can either be assigned as two assistants per officer or left to wander about the boat while the officers do all the work.  (Sounds like some kind of 1949 Red Chinese progressive agenda)

Horrible, and I mean horrible combat situational awareness.  This is the downfall of the game.  Are you getting shot at?  No warning until you take damage.  Are you being pinged?  Who knows no pinging sound, just damage from depth charges as your cue.  Chlorine gas in the sub?  No warning or visible gas, you just better figure it out when you see a crewman choke.  Periscope up or down?  Who knows?  There’s an icon to move it but no cue that it is one way or the other.  Want to see anything?  It’s a click fest.  Want to see a ship sink, good luck in clicking to see it in time (oh you can see it, just figure the clicks out.)  Want an outside view of the sub?  The image only swings left some times.  Kind of tough if you want to see a target quickly.  Want to slew the periscope onto a target?  Yea, at about 0.5 degrees a second.  Targets pass you by before you can get a bead on them.

Then the failings of:
You see the sub, but gosh going up or down there is no tilt to the boat you see.

No crash dive alarm or button.  Certainly, no crew movement to the bow as was German practice.

Emergency blow/surface?  Nope not a feature.

Abandon ship?  Not an option.  I was expecting some cool underwater escape, since rebreathers can be equipped.  Of course, basically end game by abandoning, but saving your crew and/or self can be a fun RPG aspect in a game that is suppose to be RPG among other things.

Want to track how many rounds of deck gun ammo you are firing?  Another click fest, no report or read out is given.

Want to figure out how to play the game?  Go to you tube reviews as the in-game tutorial is yet another problem to get too, and is missing significant game play information.

It’s not all bad, and it’s not the end of the world if you buy this game.  Some people truly love this game. I dislike it and think, at this point its way over hyped as to realism.  Silent Hunter does Silent Hunter better.",1607544730,1622827638,False,2,2,0.489018291234970093,0,True,False,True

Managing a u-boat crew could mean anything from complete micro-management of each and every crew member, at one extreme, to the other extreme of just issuing movement and attack orders and letting your crew work everything out themselves.  In this game, the actual crew size of at least 44 officers and sailors has been reduced to 18 sailors and 5 officers.  You directly assign officers to positions in the u-boat, but sailors are only indirectly controlled, for example, by assigning them to officers, or by ordering random sailors to activate certain valves or pumps.  

All this is well enough.  The problem, however, is that this game is just rough.  Simply playing through the tutorial missions is difficult because often you can't click on the required button.  Often you can't tell if the game is paused or not.  Buttons disappear and reappear.  The interface seems arbitrarily to divide tasks up in ways that are counter-intuitive.

One touch for the dev tho: Please make a quicksave mechanic that saves every day at sea... it would make the gameplay so much more rewarding, because at this moment it feels like playing dark souls.... which is quite annoying.

And there is a bug where if u have a radio op when you send a message then you dont need to have him for the whole duration of sending the message. i.e. Contrail spotted->Send report while crash diving->Report is sent altough you cant send under water.

My rating is based off its current state and I genuinely think this is going to be a great game in a year or two. Sadly at the moment I feel the game should not be available on Steam. 

It’s not in EA, it’s several months behind where most EA titles are in their first few weeks. The game is to the point where I’m going to have to leave it until next year. I absolutely understand EA and I safely this is not anywhere near that stage.
It crashes every 10-15mins without fail. The crashes are completely random, no one action or combination of actions seems to trigger them. I keep saving my game every 5/10 mins, but even saves are poorly optimised and take an abhorrent amount of time to process. Just to save a game takes about 20/30sec!

I have had to reload more times than I care to remember! Sadly the reloads are random, you come back to missing torpedoes, crew in different places, an action being unavailable, no sound. Basically 9/10 my reloads had something corrupted and I needed to restart and reload again.

I don’t mind this happening on the odd occasion, but it is none stop! I could accept it to an extent if the save games weren’t also corrupt!

The gameplay itself I really enjoyed. The graphics are very good and the detail on the submarine is incredible. The gameplay is rather simplified but keeps you working had with its unique way of doing things. But from the time I’ve played I’ve enjoyed it. It’s going to be a great game in time.

Sadly though, it had been released months ahead of time and you have a real mess to deal with. It’ll get fixed in the very long run but at the moment it’s tools down and wait a year or so. Best of luck with the project guys and see you in a year.~

**

I reviewed this game back in 2019 when it was release and I am sorry to say that it is still a hot mess. A few nice improvements that could have made the game promising. Alas the same dung still exists:

-random crashes
-the save/load times.... its been 2 years guys, its an utter joke!
-FPS drops left right and centre. I am writing this as my lovely crew wonder round at 5FPS

Sadly this game is never going to be anything other than a complete disappointment. In my original review I said it would give it a year. I've given it 2 and its still a frustrating mess",1557671001,1621287522,False,24,2,0.633304238319396973,0,True,False,True

- if the focus of this game is crew management... game should reflect full complement (I'm pretty sure U-96 had a complement of more than 18 men and 5 officers).
- I seem to be spending more time managing a pump and battery charge than playing a game or simulating a naval battle.
- I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure WW2 subs could charge batteries while surfaced with diesels running while not turning the prop (having to go at flank speed to get the best charge rate just doesn't seem right to me).  Charge rate being inversely proportional to boat speed while on diesels would make more sense).
- 1st mission I took was espionage mission at Portsmyth... drop a spy off.   After completing mission, got new orders to identify AA guns at the port.  The port seems to spot me and send up flares even when I'm submerged and running at a slow speed with all pumps, etc. turned off.
-- Crash to desktop every time I do get close enough to spot AA guns...  I get an orange Icon with a sailor yelling ""we're close!"" and bam!  I'm looking at my desktop.  After several attempts, I've lost interest in the game.

There’s a bunch of other smaller things that are multiplied into bigger problems simply because the nature of the game, and they start adding up, too. Subs will sink themselves in the harbor you’re stationed at. I’ve had a man die after going on a boat and not being able to give them 1 scrap (which I had 5 of, so I don’t know wtf the game is talking about). And overall most of the waiting and traveling and hoping the game doesn’t be weird is not worth it for me. 

Overall, I’m not gonna spend another 20 minutes traveling across the map trying to see if my last save will work after the 3rd time, and end up losing an hour and a half for no reason.

Edit: I've played the game again, and I realize it's in Early Access, but Some more things from my extra 1 hour play time:
-An officer ended up teleporting off my sub and bounced in the water, where my sub essentially became lost on the map forever (I didn't even know getting lost was a thing until the bug)
-An easy mission turned into one of the most difficult by spawning a 14 ship escort group when I had to destroy a freighter. Dunno what that was about.
-Are corvettes just harder to target regardless of distance or did the game decide, by itself, that the freighter some miles away was easier to be able to track than a ship 5 yards away.
-I guess this isn't so much a bug as it is a problem that I personally don't like, but I can't select the officer on the attack periscope after a ship was sunk until some time after. I can't select other ships unless I specifically click on the officer on the attack periscope to attack the ship I'm trying to attack. It would be cool if there was a different way other than running the sub manually, or at least fix this particular problem, especially since you have to wait for them to track the ship in the first place before you could launch the torpedo (unless you do it manually).

Also have quite the bone to pick with my officers, they singlehandedly have drown my boat multiple times. Just finished a game where I was nipped by a depth charge in just the galley, locked it down and would have been completely under control.

First officer Dick Tingler lays dozing in his bunk, perhaps dreaming of currywurst sausage, or a tankard of ale. All is quiet on U99. The radio operator, Fanny Schmeller listens intently for any signals on the radar. His shift started long ago, as his eyes grow weary and tired, not an eventful trip at all. When suddenly a blip appears on his screen. He mews his detector around the area as the blip reappears, frowning his brow, as he ponders the cause. His eyes grow wider as another blip appears, then another, then another. Officer Schmeller then calls to the Kapitain on the bridge, to look to bearing 260, where the blips had appeared. Kapitain Schmacher raises his Uzo and clicks it round to the bearing. peering out into the night, he can only see blackness. He quickly, but thoroughly scans the horizon. A break in the clouds, revealed some shadowy figures of ships in the distance, their engines casting thick black smoke into the nighttime sky. He felt an excitment in his chest. They had come across a British Convoy, Perhaps on their way to Africa, or some other far off land. He told the watchmen to hastily make their way down the hatch and make preparations to dive. The long game of cat and mouse has begun. 
Schmacher follows his crew down into the submarine, and tightly seals the hatch shut. In no time at all, the ballasts are full, and U99 slips quietly beneath the waves. Below the gentle waves, careful preparations are being made for the attack, the crew are ready to engage. Kapitain Schmacher settles into his chair of the attack periscope and makes himself comfortable. He raises his periscope, silently it breakes through the surface of the ocean. The ships are closer now, he counts a total of 15 ships, a very lucrative haul for a newly appointed Kapitain. A total of 3 escort ships, 7 freight and 5 tankers, surely an easy take. Non of the ships have taken evasive action, U99 has remained undetected. Schmacher begins targeting the closest of the tankers, careful mathematics and calculations must be taken to ensure a perfect strike. The crew wait in anticipation, all their preparations are complete. Schmacher has completed his targeting and calmly gives the order to flood fore tubes III and IV. Schmacher Then....

Uboat is a fantastic submarine simulator, and its developers clearly paid attention to its exquisite details.  It feels like you're really having to manage all the intricacies of being a submarine captain, from assigning jobs to sailors and monitoring the subs systems and engines.  But at its core, Uboat is missing a very important element: a story.  In the game, you're given missions to sail around parts of the world and sink a certain amount of tonnage, but there's no backstory -- you don't know why you're doing any of it, and so after a while, it all just becomes a game about shooting torpedoes.  Even worse, when you encounter enemy destroyers and corvettes, the game is reduced to a 1-dimensional mechanic of trying to turn your ship a lot to avoid depth charges.  Don't even think about picking a fight with a destroyer -- you might sink it, but an entire fleet of corvettes will pound you into the ocean floor.  

At the end of the day, I'm not planning to play this game any more simply because it's gotten boring and repetitive.  I'm disappointed knowing such a great Uboat simulator can have so little depth.",1619438384,1619438384,False,0,0,0.449455201625823975,0,True,False,True

The devs seem to have put a lot of thought into the gameplay. The main problems and annoyances that the game has can all be easily fixed thanks to it's excellent mod support via the Steam Workshop.

My main complaints despite the mod support still consist of 2 things:

1. There is only 1 type of uboat. The type 7c. It would have been nice to have more but with the level of detail they put into the 1 available uboat type, it's kind of understandable. The fact that there are a lot of upgrades for your ship does make this less of a bummer,

2. There's not as much variety. I'm always shooting at the same 3 different kinds of ships and the occasional destroyer. The devs have lately been adding more ships into the game but I feel the variety is still lacking. Perhaps this will change in the future.

my u-boat taps their u-boat because i was close. like... scratched the paint. no damage to my ship. didn't even move their ship.

they sink.

Revision 1: 

- routine tasks such as running air compressors or the bilge pump cannot be automated. you, as the commander of the boat, have to tell someone to do it each and every time. or do it yourself. But much more crucial tasks like engine switching, battery recharge, ventilation on surfacing? automatic. i don't get it.

- you can set your officers to have a hierarchy of responsibility or preference for certain tasks, which is really awesome. Except sometimes they just decide to lay in their bunks fully rested and do nothing? Better hope it isn't your navigator who decides to quit his job, because then you will be lost at sea.

- you have to heat all torpedoes every like 20 minutes or so, which means they are never heated when you need them, so they dud a lot. The worst part about this design decision is that G7a(T1) torpedoes are steam powered or 'wet-heater' torpedoes. wtf are you preheating?

- the map is two dimensional when you are zoomed out but turns isometric/3d when you zoom closer. contact icons including your sub are always profile on the 2D map, regardless of the heading, so you have to zoom way in to be able to gauge angles or plot intercepts.

Visually beautiful and great atmosphere, especially if played in first person. The game suffers a lot from weird design choices and annoying bugs. (Though some mods address that) I will update this review once the game leaves early access.

Pro's:
- Visually beautiful. The fully fleshed out interior of the boat, water physics and the possibility to play in first person really adds to the immersion. Had quite a few ""Das Boot"" moments because of this.
- Personally, I really like the compartment view. It's a nice upgrade from a 2d interface like in sh3. (Don't know about its successors, 'cause I haven't played them)
- Neatly designed UI that helps assigning tasks to your officers

Neutrals
- The mission variety is a little bit lacking. (Which might be expected for a uboat) The random encounters (Random assignments from the BdU) during those missions spice things up, although they are a little bit ill timed sometimes.
- It really is a shame that torpedos are impact only and torpedo depth hardly matters. Personally, I can live with that, though others might not. (There is a mod that fixes that)
- Not implementing a sort of ""story line"" where the player is informed about the on-goings of the war (like in the grey wolves mod pack for sh3) seems like a missed opportunity. (If I remember correctly, there is a ""campaign"" planned, though I don't know any details)

Con's:
- As TheDeadCalm describes it in his review: Sometimes the crew management feels like you are constantly babysitting a bunch of toddlers. E.g. Engineers warming torpedos (makes lots of noise) even if rigged for silent running as if they wanted to die, Crew members not doing assigned tasks just because and my personal favorite:  My chief engineer, who is assigned to fixing a leak in a flooded compartment, standing in front of said leak, choking on his brand new, freshly unpacked rebreather (yes, choking) while ignoring his initial order.
- Pathfinding is bugged for certain harbors (La Spezia). If you want to dock at those harbors, prepare for an annoyingly frustrating experience involving lots of damaged quay walls, water ingress, damaged equipment and dead crew mates.

These last two points are keeping me from playing the game for the moment. I will wait for future updates and adjust my  review accordingly. The game has so much potential and great ideas that it would be a shame not to keep my hopes up.",1618769836,1618769836,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

UPDATE: I tried the most recent version (April 2021) but its still got lots of issues. There are now tutorial missions but not one of them is about how to shoot your torpedoes or attack the enemy(?) Of the tutorials I did try, they just ended up breaking because accidentally did something wrong and then the help messages would never appear again. Pretty useless. 4 hours of play isn't much, but in that time I would have expected to at least have seen an enemy ship...nothing.

Left out at sea with the tutorials I'm afraid.

[list]
[*] It's far better, and more polished than I had anticipated. I'm really excited to see where this all ends up.
[*] The devs are dropping weekly updates and YouTube videos of upcoming release changes.
[*] You can play 1st person, mostly map/objects, or both - you choose. All are well done.
[*] This is a UBOAT simulator, not an iPad/Android tap-and-win cross-over game. Even if you come from the SH series, you'll need to spend some time learning. 
[*] For first-timers, I highly suggest reviewing some YouTube videos, especially the tutorials from Lite_ly Salted - he has them in order and I would consider it a ""must"" to get things going smoothly. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN8uRgI0AODSgnscyK53sXMzo0pchmLm3
[*] Get the TDC mod eventually - it' excellent. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2071624443
[*] For players like me who might want to get around doing certain things, there are console commands, and you can easily edit some .xlsx files to adjust the game to your liking. Mods also handle this pretty well. For example, I just wanted to get my officers all the XP at once, and also just get all the best gear on my ship without trudging through missions. I was able to do that using a series of console commands. Don't want to deal with the monetary part? Just a console command away. I appreciate games where you're not forced into a grind, if you don't want to be.
[*] You'll read about the PITA in managing your officers and staff. It actually isn't that hard at all. See some posts and videos about setting up a couple of simple schedules - and it pretty much takes care of itself. I was frustrated like some other people until I found out how to schedule properly.
[*] The interface takes getting used to - full stop. After a couple of hours you'll have the hang of it though.

The can be played almost turn based, where if more realism is wanted the option is there. The ability to have the AI put in the targeting data, or doing it yourself, this is very playable if your a beginner, or more experienced. The only downside so far is the how quickly its over. more missions, and mission types would be a welcome addition, The choice of sub ending is something like the type XXI prototype as a new game+ would be nice. Sum is that it is a well put together game that is beautiful to play and i am looking forward to the end result.

Update 4/11
b129 took a month break from this game as my son Vincent was ill (Vincent is my P.C). The game has taken leaps since i last played. love the options that have been added. Of course its early access but would love to see a few thing improved, 1 officer stationed as flak gunner accompanied by enlisted men so all four guns can be fired when needed, there aim is atrocious! they will use all ammo and hit nothing. when playing in first person only having the ability to select the speed telegram from the bridge, or above deck, depth selection at valves rather then having to bring up the UI  much like the pump and lights work, this would help with immersion, as well as talking to a character to have them do specific jobs rather then only through the UI. this isn't game breaking but close. and Again the type XXI despite it coming to late to be used in the war would be a beautiful option. either way this is a beautiful game keep up the amazing work.",1595629811,1618179645,True,4,0,0.565852522850036621,0,True,False,True

This game can be adjusted with mods if youre not the most experienced captain of them all. To me it was a shock that there was more crew management involved than really anything else. The whole game capsulates within its simulation, a kindof realistic sense in which you live in the boots of a world war 2 german Uboat captain. And how scary the game gets when trying to run or hide from an escort on the sea floor. What makes it ten times worse is the fact that members of your crew can betray you unintentionally by turning their back on you, simply by screaming or going crazy when youre being hunted. As a captain you take on a role in which you have to increase the morale of your crew just like many ships in navies across the world have to do in real life. 
       Increasing the morale however, becomes fairly easy once you reach a certain point in the game where you are familiar with all the controls and how the systems of the game operate in creating an efficient uboat crew to take out those pesty allied shipping tankers. 
       As a sailor myself i would say this game accurately represents the oceans chaotic movements and its complete and udder inconsistency within itself on an hourly basis. The games weather system is phenominal, one day you could be steaming along on the surface and its completely foggy and you get no contacts nor a firing solution on any targets for that whole day or week or so. 
       One thing I would recommend is taking your time on approaching targets and especially slowing time compression down. Get out of the map sometime, check around you visually and just take a moment to see your boat pushing through the waves, consistently maintaining a condition of readiness to give doom upon any allied vessel on command. Look around at the water and how it flows for a minute. Immerse yourself into this game and i promise you, you will not regret it.

The graphics in my personal opinion are a little spotty. Sometimes the textures look a little weird and the game comes out a little blurry, when people walk around on your boat or on the pier you begin to notice how they ghost around almost as if a transparent shadow is following them everywhere. That is the only complaint i have about it.

I would also genuinely recommend playing this game tipsy, once i was playing and came across an entire convoy with a carrier in it, sank the whole carrier and a couple of oil tankers in a couple of passes and then returned back to base only to grab the bottle off my desk and celebrate a little more, then send my crew on some well deserved leave, exit the game, and go pass out in my bed with full confidence that i was living just as how they were back in the day.

Elements of FTL crossed with a sub sim makes an amazing game. It can be very accessible if you play it like a crew management game FTL style game from the ant-farm and map perspective. Or, if you want it to be more hardcore sim like you can download a simple mod called TDC (torpedo data computer) that makes using the torpedoes easier & more historically accurate (there's even little knobs and doodads you get to flip). Way easier than it looks at first. It's fun playing either way. There's a lot of configurable options and amazing mods- one thing I have only tried for an hour or so a first-person lock + no enemy map icons game and got sank because I crashed into an oiltanker in some bad fog. Seems like an entirely different, very claustrophobic game played this way - fun with some big ol headphones at crushing depths running silent...

For an early access game, it is very enjoyable and relatively bug free!
It offers a longer, more drawn out and difficult experience for those who like that sort of thing, and a quicker more 'to the action' game for those who prefer that.

Submarine management is fairly easy to pick up once you've played the tutorial and the game for a while.

Graphics and layout is also very good.

One thing I would add to this game, is the ability to dive at a steeper angle (Potentially utilising the weight of the submariners at the front of the UBOAT?)

The torpedos are poorly implemented and I end up having much better success with much older used torpedoes, which are hard to come by once you have researched the TE5 so I end up waiting in port for a long time for other 1-3 other torpedoes to become available. Final two issues are that when receiving messages from BDU they never finish when receiving them and disappear.

With all of the mods available, it's a pretty immersive and realistic sub sim.  At first glance I wasn't going to try this, but figured with it being on sale I might as well.  

Right away the biggest improvement (for some things) are the graphics.  The boat and water are well done, but seeing land reminds me of SH3.  The UI is very different from what I'm used to, but really doesn't take long to become familiar with. Some things I really missed were the nautical compass and UI gauges.  First person movement through the boat is really nice and the cut-away when zoomed out slightly was odd at first, but became convenient and interesting.  

So now for the big things.  In SH3 I found myself turning crew management off because it was designed so badly.  It took far too much attention for a skipper already doing everything.  Crew management in this game not only makes more sense than SH3's did, but I kind of like it.  It's management, but not micromanagement.  At first I didn't like that I couldn't assign enlisted crew to stations, but then noticed my officers were assigning them and it appeared based on their skills.  If that is indeed what is happening then that's a great set up. The need for so many officers, especially on a ViiC, was kind of a negative for me.  SH3 had NCO's and I used them to supervise deck guns, radio, sonar, etc.  It would be a great addition to this game to have NCO's that could be assigned by the skipper to help with relieving tired officers and not needing 7-8 officers. This would help seeing as not having an officer manning the engine room costs you 30% more fuel!! Not sure why it's such a massive penalty, but that's a lot of fuel.

Something else that could really use some tweaking is the targeting.  In SH3, I did it manually.  With so much going on in the boat I always thought it would be great if the crew could efficiently take on more of the jobs they realistically would have.  With this game, I thought it might be the case.  The problem I've run into is that in many cases it takes so long for the crew to get a solution that I end up being out of position or mauled by escorts.  It just shouldn't take as long as it does.  In SH3, I would sometimes find myself in knife fights with escorts (after hitting merchants in the convoy) and was able to let them in close and wing it.  That doesn't mean pray and spray.  I took measurements of speed, distance and course, but I did it fast and made estimates.  I had a corvette start mauling me in this game while I was waiting for a solution and tried to knife fight it.  All I can say is forget it.  In SH3 I was also able to toggle between impact/magnetic fuses and adjust speed on steam fish.

So would I recommend this game?  Sure would.  It's fun and the dev's appear to be actively involved in improving it.  There's a lot of potential here and I look forward to seeing the game evolve.

Edit* I've got a few more hours in and parts of this game's targeting are really frustrating.  My mission was to go near shore after making a drop off, create a diversion and leave.  An enemy DD was sent after me and my crew just wouldn't give me a firing solution. The part that had me pulling my hair out was the damn thing was coming right at me and if it even just let me fire straight out of the tube I would've hit it!!  But nope.  Just sit there and get DC'd in 17m of water until everyone drowns. Firing as is wan't even an option. If the crew can't figure out a solution for something coming straight at us in shallow/calm water, then what the hell are they doing on a boat??

The difficulty is weighted fairly; the harder difficulty will make things more realistic and you personally will be responsible for the targeting of ships including getting three values of data (the ships speed, the distance to the ship, and the course the ship is taking) to put together your torpedo firing paths. 

Most of my hours have been in the realistic setting with things like darker nights (this is the first game I've had to be an inch away from my screen to play at times) and the manual aiming. With both, hitting targets is extremely rough at times and that's also why I say it's satisfying, because hitting your target becomes more rewarding given the effort it takes to manually aim torpedoes. I've played without the manual aiming, but it was some time ago and the game has expanded since so I can't speak to that experience as much, although in manual it seems like your ""Leader"" officers are more or less ways for you, the player, to interact with the world through them (aiming torpedoes, observation, and in many cases using the deck guns). 

Other reviews mention bugs, which I've also encountered a few, but they're not common. Although I understand they could be annoying, the few I've dealt with haven't been too bad, certainly nothing close to game-breaking.

Graphically, it's fine. Detailed enough to look good 90% of the time however when close to land, well it doesn't shine as much. Gameplay wise, it does what it says on the tin. There's a reasonable amount of depth (no pun intended) to ensure you are usually on your toes, however it's far from optimised.

On my first sortie to locate all the AA positions in Portsmouth and boy, does it lag. It stutters and jerks at times and then, when you think it's settled, I had a Flower Class Corvette launch out of dock, through the air in some weird, aerial acrobatic display to land not far away and proceed to sink the living snot out of me. This wouldn't have been such an issue had the target location to get to not been right at a dock. 

Overall, this game has promise however please sort these basic bugs and optimisations out soon. Would I recommend it? Well, I only get thumbs up or thumbs down as options when I'd really be on the fence on this one. As a result, I have to say not until the above is fixed.

Not since EA released Spore have I got this excited about a new release (and how very quickly that excitement turned into disappointment, amIright?). Even Microsoft Flight Simulator, as excellent as it is, hasn't got a review out of me (yet). However, despite the existence of some truly great games, and truly great developers out there, this is the first time in a very long time that I have been genuinely blown away by a new title. If the intention of Deep Water Studio was to recreate the tedium and terror of submersible warfare, strikingly similar to Das Boot, then they have done so magnificently. This game is so close to perfection; just a few tweaks here and there and it would be absolutely flawless. Installation was a breeze (download was about 7.5Gb although it initially reported as 24Gb for some reason), and the default graphics and sound options were very high and playable right out of the box, without needing further adjustment (Ryzen 7 3700X, 32Gb RAM through a Gigabyte RX5700 XT display card and pushed onto a 2560x1440 FreeSync monitor, so it's a good spec but not top end). 
Yes, there are some issues with pathfinding (crew members do a sort of cha-cha-cha dance trying to get past each other from time to time), and the balancing needs some attention (I managed to put 5 dud torpedoes into a single ship, which did kind of break the immersion for me).
Highlights so far: blundering into an Atlantic gale, just off the coast of the Azores, diving to 50m to avoid the swell and watching, mesmerised beneath the waves, as lightning flashes and plays far above, illuminating the hull of the prowling U-boat. Then detecting propellers with the onboard hydrophone, and tailing a contact for over 1000km, surfacing to recharge batteries and catch up then descending to periscope depth when closer, certain that this must be a fast moving military warship of high value, only to discover that is was another bloody U-boat!
Verdict: 10/10 - would go on a wild goose chase with a boatload of Germans again.
TL;DR - Visually stunning, plays really nicely but still has some minor gameplay issues to iron out. Highly recommended, even incomplete as it is.",1617082284,1617082284,True,19,0,0.725237369537353516,2,True,False,True

For example i was all lined up to the ship in a convoy that i had to sink, made my way undetected through destroyers and corvettes and did all the appropriate functions to launch a torpedo and get ready for the big moment to launch and then almost 1 second after i pressed the fire button i get a message saying ""torpedo miss"" then look at map to see why and the torpedo went 90 degrees from the point that i aimed.

Land smack dab in the middle of a Royal Navy group which ultimately sunk me. In the ensuing chaos that followed we managed to plug the leaks, took forever to pump out all that water, when the crew panicked two of them were choked out. Air was depleting, I then discovered I could use my ventilators to recycle our air into breathable air. The British Navy heard our pumps and more bombs were dropped around us. Eventually, when enough water was pumped out, and I learned several more game mechanics, I was able to start rising to the surface more and more. After navigating a Km away from where we were, we were able to rise to periscope depth and take a little revenge on the Brits that sank us. We disabled a Destroyer with torpedoes, and then sank a Corvette with more torpedoes, then made a getaway for home. On the way home I realized we weren't sailing fully above the water, I then discovered we needed to use the air compressors to fully rise out of the water.

The moral of the story is, learn to use your submarine by using the tutorial, and then go hunt for merchant ships, and avoid the Royal Navy at all costs. Also probably should pay attention when you're sailing between England and Ireland.

However, what kills the game are the extremely frustrating bugs. 

In my 50 hours of playing, I've had everything from people being frozen in place and people not doing what they're told. People not doing what you tell them seems to be the theme of the game. You are not in charge of ""Das Boot"", with a hardy crew, ready to fight, but a swimming kindergarten with torpedoes. 

I'm not even going into how unrealistic the game is but there's one aspect that reeeally makes me want to drown myself in my own watery grave.  

The boat only has two settings when ""diving"". Either the tanks are full of water and the boat can change the depth freely or they're empty and you're on the surface. It is not possible to change how full the tanks are, or which of tanks should be flooded. If you're hit with underwater bombs or you manage to get rammed and the boat or a compartment starts getting flooded just a little, you will always sink, as the tanks are already full of water. You can now keep sinking or empty the tanks and surface. Both will get you killed. This seems stupid. It is stupid. And it's incredibly frustrating, as there are only two encounters: the ones where you remain undetected, and you kill them all or you die. That's it. No cool underwater battles, where you and your crew clench to anything they can hold and pray to get out alive like in ""Das Boot"". Instead, you enjoy seeing the special-education-crew getting slowly killed by the water and pressure.

In the end I’m not really sure what to make of this game. I would like to enjoy it and it saddens me that things like bugs and weird mechanics are destroying my experience. It would be awesome to see the producer address these issues until then I’ll stay on the surface.

It is the same poor UI - which somehow means i can see the u-boat like a satellite, or in cross section, but not pan out to say 100m to scan around the boat. The controls are just plain annoying, they are perfect for showing off the incredible modelling and the beauty of the open sea, but not much else.

Although the mission loop is the same as the superb SH3 somehow that game made the journey, the mission,  even the the waiting, eventful. In U-Boat it mostly feels dull. Getting Depth Charged in SH3 was a nerve-wracking experience. In U-Boat often accelerate time when being Depth-Charged just to find out what happened and not waste time. If you are hit then a depth charge often does such damage that it all falls apart quickly, which might be quite accurate but is not overly fun especially as no-one on the boat can tie their shoelaces without my blessing.

Combat itself is underwhelming. Either you are fast enough/close enough to get some shots off or you are set upon by Escorts with X-Ray Telescopic vision. Once you are spotted then it is simply a matter of turning everything off and just waiting for the escorts to lose interest, which they do very quickly. 
Also it feels like many of the 'details' are nerfed. The batteries, air, and ESPECIALLY the morale of the Crew all seem far too limited, too gamey. 

In SH3 i felt like i was IN the U-Boat.
With U-Boat i only feel like a 'U-Boat Manager'.

Even though i have these impressive lists of histories and personalities on my undersized crew none of them are 'close' enough to me to actually feel any interest in what they are going through. I can press buttons, launch torpedoes or fire my 88mm but somehow it all feels like it is all an abstraction. The UI adds to the 'stand off' feeling of the game.

I understand this is early acess game, but this is garbage... Bug after bug after bug, Now I have a bugged game file and have to begin all over again. Manual TDC is bullshit because the AOB dosent make sens, turn that shit how ever u want it dsnt matter even with moving targets. If u fail a mission you cant get another one, so u need to begin all over again.  Crew member cant go and rest, tried for hours to fix it because I only have one saved file so I tried alot of things to make them rest but some just won and get stuck so you have to start all over again. Crew member get stuck in diffrent sections in the boat so you have to start all over again. Crew can get stuck in each other so you have to start all over again. If one crew member buggs out and you take him out from the crew list and hire someone els, guess what happends.... HE IS STILL ON THE BOAT BUT NOW YOU CANT EVEN HIGHLIGHT HIM.  AND THEIR IS 2 OF HIM IF YOU HIRE HIM AGAIN ! SHIT GAME DONT BOTHER. EVEN SILENT HUNTER 5 IS WAY BETTER.

Becasue its to shallow at the port they wont consider sunk I guess. So my mission failed and had to go back to my port to get more torpedos ? nope. I alt+f4 and going to have to whait another year maybe since they add cool new stuff to the game, but apperently dont have time to fix the things that are broken...

What's new here is a first person option that works astonishingly well and crew management that is challenging without being tedious.  This is still in early access so some features aren't complete and play balance can be improved.  For example, morale is only challenging in the first few missions.  Same with boat upgrades.  Some of the missions are a bit repetitive.  Finally, those who like to bust out the slide rule and fire up the TDC may be disappointed that torpedo launches aren't more complex.  I understand that more complex torpedo calculations are a planned option for the future.  For now it's mostly about getting in a good position and maximizing available sensors to get a good track.

But overall this is a great game that seems positioned to just get better.  The things it does well it does really well.  The developer regularly posts updates and they continue to improve the game.  I would give it a ""B"" in its current state but see the clear potential for this to be an ""A+"" all-time great.  Recommended for anyone looking for a decent WWII sub sim.",1615654298,1615654820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Bought this back at the beginning of EA and it has come a long way. It is quite playable in B128 state with very few minor bugs for me and I'm using quite a few mods.

The game has the 1st person element, some RPG elements, crew management, and it's scaleable from novice player to using trigonometry for targeting.

The mod community is robust and there are many levels of detail to choose from. One can only expect the mods to continue from their excellence at the current time to even better options.

Here's some of the main problems I have found out with this game (this will be a long and detailed review);

1) Very few mission variety; Most of the missions in the game environment are repeating. There could more mission types (e.g. transporting special forces/army officers/agents to other countries in conflict such like North Africa, Argentina, UK, USA), carrying supplies secretly to the other Kriegsmarine battleships (milkcows) in need of resupply, launching attacks/laying mines on shipyards/port areas, as it has happened in the history,

2) Annoying crew management problems; Let me explain, even a particular key-crewmember (mechanic, deck officer, hydrophone operator) is needed urgently in a combat, that same guy becomes tired after a long working period and decides to leave working to take a f****g rest. 
Yes, there's a pretty good feature ""Work and Rest Hour Planner"" for key-crewmember. But, even if you planned that guy for a particular important task, he won't do it. And while you are fully focusing on to evade the chasing escorts while getting deepcharged, you have to specifically give orders for that guy. 
In respect of managing such crewmembers, you should keep in mind all the time to tell that guy we need to reload godd*mn torpedoes. (Is this a 1 person managed submarine, or a crew controlled submarine?)

3) Very limited interaction with the other sumbarine components; This game has a pretty FPS control option for each crewmember.
But for carrying some particular tasks -even if u are in FPS mode- for such things like manually maneuvering the submarine, plot a route on the chart, setting the manualy fire control system etc. you need to use UI (user interface).
Because there is no much interaction function in the game to click on stuff. 
There should have been more funcitoning components that would allow you to interact with, where you can take control of them individually, without the automated AI calculations/actions.


Here's the sum of my review and suggestions for the developers;

1)Graphics - Pretty OK and beautiful sea graphics and it's perfect for a simulator game,

2)Gameplay - Missing a lot features; Bad UI, Limited interaction/features with manual sub component controls (engine, hydraphone, radio, engine telegraphs/rudder, horizontal rudders etc.), not detailed navigation planner,

Note: It is normal for an early access game, I know. 
But, it should not take this much amount of time to develop these.
We all know that the this game is still in early access and not complete. But, HOWEVER, ""The Developers"" decided to divide their resources and working hours to develop another game called ""Destroyer"", when still there is lots of missing features in U-BOAT.

3)SFX - Kinda OK, but can be improved more (especially for the sounds of close/distant explosions, deck gun firing sounds, shell hit/explosion sounds and enemy shells flyby sounds),

4)Physics - Kinda OK, but sinking mechanics of ships SHOULD NOT RELAY ON HEALTH BAR SYSTEM. There should be at least ship divisioning mechanics in the inner hull part of each ship, so they would sink realistically (e.g. when a merchant vessel got its hull breached by damage and its cargo hold area (or engine room with huge empty volume) is flooded, this would create a major problem for its buoyancy. So it won't take much effort to sink it, REALISTICALLY.

5)Micromanagement of Crew and Supplies - It is a promising and inovative feature of its class amongst the other submarine games. (Besides a few disturbing problems on crew management part as I have written above). It needs to be developed more and realistically for much more immersion.

Overall, playing Uboat has been a positive experience. I enjoyed sweating over the torpedo firing solutions, staying hidden and planning out how to engage convoys. Being a merchant mariner and history enthusiast, it was fun to see all the gameplay mechanics included, especially the cleaning and cooking stations for added realism. There is much that the devs still need to work on, especially time compression, explaining new features like wreck diving and maybe adding the TDC instead of requiring it to be downloaded from the mod list. 

A lot of the features I figured out how to use were not intuitive and required me to search the Steam discussion forums. Some of the game mechanics like wind speed are not implemented yet and other features like purchasing small arms has been included but does not yet have a purpose. 

I would recommend purchasing the game. During all my hours, the game remained stable and never crashed. I did encounter several bugs like flying into the sky or being damaged by nothing, but the devs are active and work well with the players to explain how to play their game and get feedback. The modding community has already come out with a lot of content like new songs on the radio (which is needed as right now there appears to only be 4 songs for 2 stations), realistic power draw for ship systems, and period accurate national ensigns.

The UI can be horribly confusing and unintuitive, and some really basic things are frustratingly difficult to figure out (for instance - how do you select which type of torpedo to load once you have the torpedo bays view open? Can using the compressors to refill air tanks be automated by a sailor somehow?). 

There are also very frustrating behaviours that just feel unintuitive and weird to me - during an approach (within visual contact) to a convoy my captain decided to go sleep, and I can't rouse him, the switch into lower time compression once you near your base is terribly irritating, the whole mechanic for skilling up your crew is wonky and cumbersome etc. Having your crew automatically use the deck gun is a near 100% guarantee that they will just waste all your ammo without scoring a single hit even if you're broadsiding from 100 meters.

It's a beautiful game, especially with the ability to walk around your ship, and the UI is well-designed and pretty easy to figure out. The action draws you in really well - you have to stay on top of everything if you want your strike to go well AND manage a getaway. The developers release updates frequently and seem to be taking the community's criticism into account.

Here are the only things I can think of that would improve the game:
-The TDC mod should be in the base game. Maybe it's because I'm a SH3 vet, but I cannot play this game without the real TDC mod. I had to stop for a few weeks when B128 came out because the stock targeting controls feel so pathetic compared to using the ""real thing.""
-Need more variety. I'm sure this will come in time as content is added to the game, but I'm running across a lot of identical convoys.
-More realism options. Things like limiting external camera, requiring manual flag identification to determine friend/foe, etc. There are already a good number of these options - I'd just like to see the full complement from Silent Hunter/GWX/etc.

Some of the issues are mechanical and may be improved relatively soon. The UI feels clunky and unintuitive. There seem to be a fair amount of bugs in the tutorial (the only thing I had time to try). The save system is functional but... not great (I kept having to restart the 'campaign' just to do a different tutorial mission when they didn't complete). I love the way the map can zoom right down to the ocean but everything about viewing things at that level is nauseating- I try to pan around and it's insanely fast. I want to zoom out a touch to see more of the sub but the compartments all close up so I can't see anything! It's a mess and feels like a step back rather than a step forward from the simplicity of doing stuff like that in the silent hunter franchise. Hopefully it improves.

The more concerning issue is that it feels like they're trying to make the game into ""Sims"" or something. I dunno, maybe it's just the tutorial but I alt-F4ed after the game prompts you to have an officer go choke out a sailor because the latter starts running around like a maniac after 10 minutes being underwater because a destroyed is above.

When i saw UBOAT in sale i went YOLO, wanting to finally try some subsim. And i must say, it was a good way to get into this type of game. If you need to start slow, the game helps you in many ways - with crew management, spotting, calculating torpedo course etc. If you are hardcore enthusiasist, you can dive right into it, doing everything by yourself. 

Graphics of the game... I was never really a graphics person, but you don't even have to be in this case. I find the graphical part of game appealing and nicely looking. Can't wait for some updates on how water will behave differently around hull etc, but these are minor things.

GUI wise its simple, everything is explained in tutorial which i strongly recommend to play if you are new. Without it i'd be totally lost.

Missions, there might be some more variety in enemy ships / planes and I'd love to meet some friendly units other than uboats too. That might be the future! Otherwise its mostly patrolling and some encounters thanks to picking up radio transmissions from enemy or friendly units or HQ. 

In the begining i did let my crew calculate torpedo stuff for me, but when you measure everything right for the first time all by yourself. That is something really different. SATISFACTION as you see hits of torpedos you calculated from A to Z, awesome.

If development will continue as promised it's gonna be awesome title. Even in this state it will keep you in a state of enjoyment for hours. Apart from times when you die, because you were cocky. :)

However its 100% still early access because from just playing 38 hours i have a few bugs so:

1. if there is rough seas and you time compression, DON'T DO IT IN SHALLOW WATERS. i have hit the sea floor four times because of the exaggerated bucking of the boot that time compression causes.

2.(Again time compression) if you speed up just as a torp hits a ship, it will launch the ship 4-5 meters in the air, which is funny and isn't game breaking but its not realistic lol.

now some problems, not necessarily bugs though:

1. this game will eat your CPU alive, unless you have a very expensive machine- but this is not permanent because this is still early access so the devs will get round to Optimising the game.

2. personally i would love some different U-Boat Classes in the future, but those will probably be DLC's when the game fully releases :)

3. Also something that i think would be really neat would be they the torpedo storage will fully reset each year or 6 months as i only use T1's, T3's and occasionally T5's. but as i buy them all the storage gets taken up by the crappy T2's so i have to travel around to other ports to find my preferred torps.

The game is more about taking care of your crew and getting them to do their jobs than it is about single handed management of a Uboat.  But it allows you to do that too if you so desire.  The interface could be a little smoother between left/right mouse buttons and moving in and out of the Uboat zoom (I still haven't quite figured all of that out).  But it's a fairly cool game that's unique enough in this genre to sit next to the Silent Hunter series without feeling like it's another sub sim.

There is a lot to learn here, but UBOAT does an excellent job of easing you into it. 

You can keep things pretty light by utilizing your officers to do things like torpedo calculations and hydrophone monitoring. When you're ready, you can try your hand at doing those things manually if you want to. And to take it even deeper, you can install mods (TDC, in particular) to make things even more technical and historically accurate.

But given that, I decided to give this game a chance anyway and keep an open mind.  I liked the look of the sub, the graphics, the details you see inside, and the idea of crew management.  That drew me in.
However, when I actually tried the game, it was very disappointing.  I felt more like an observer than a participant.  A view of the inside of the sub was pretty neat...but I'm not ""inside"" the sub.  Moving around the outside world (tied in with the map) offered some great graphics, but again, it just gave me the feeling of an observer. I think there was a 1st person view, but that too was disappointing.   I'm a hardcore submarine gamer.  This game made me feel dumb for having played it.  I think it has the ability to plot your own course (or so I would hope) and to calculate your own torpedo shots. However, it was much too easy just to have your crew do that for you.  All I had to do was click on the contacts on the map and the crew did an intercept course for me.   Likewise, this was the same for calculating a torpedo shot.  I'm sure some may argue with this, but to me this game seemed more about crew management than actual submarine simulation.  Although, it might have something for the hardcore submarine simulator enthusiast, the game seemed more for the casual gamer.  The crew management part I thought would be really enjoyable...down to even planning out and loading the sub up with food.  But again, that too was disappointing.

the most annoying thing that they should fix is your idiot of a mechanic that is in charge of warming up the torpedoes. when you set sail he is always warming them up. but as soon as you get into an attack he just stops warming them up. so i line up the shot, get the distance, speed and course... to tap on the torpedo launch icon for me to see non pre-heated torpedoes... then it takes 3 fucking years for him to warm up 1 torpedo, and by then your targets data is outdated. and when you are in the middle of a huge convoy you dont really want to spend extra time dawdling waiting to shoot.

another is the radio, you can only use the radio (music) when your radio operator is there. so when you want to listen to some tunes on radio gibraltar. while time compressing at 6500 speed you listen to like 5 seconds of music. why cant he just leave the radio on while he goes and sleeps? 

also the tutorials in game are good but there are not enough to cover other important functions of the ship. for example how do i check depth under keel? or how do the escorts know exactly where i am when i turned on blue lights going at forward 1 at maximum safe depth? there are other things in the ship you need to manually do to actually go full silent running that the game doesnt tell you, like turning off the gyro compass, switching to manual steering and dive planes to make as little noise as possible.",1612348477,1612348477,True,13,1,0.681795299053192139,0,True,False,True

After infiltrating the area and working in shallow water where I could only just fully submerge, I sunk two enemy destroyers and having fulfilled the mission brief, began retreating to the safety of open water. Avoiding gun emplacements on shore, planes searching overhead and patrolling (and very angry) destroyers/corvettes hunting for my uboat whilst dodging submarine nets and navigating the shallow water meant for a knife edge balance between the need for stealth and the decaying discipline on board due to having been underwater and in combat for so long. One crew member broke down and had to be subdued and another had a heart attack but we made out in one piece. All this combined for one of the most intense 3 hours of game play I've had in a while.

Inside the sub has been well done - very detailed.
Attack play of firing torps is not too exciting
More interaction at HQ and review of conquest like all the tonnage you just sunk would be interesting to see
There is a post order medal award for the officers 
Maybe I'm missing it but I list of all ships sunk with tonnage vs. other Uboat fleet would add to realism
I have sunk enemy war ships that you think would be a big deal but they dont count in our tonnage numbers

1) When I have several torpedo types on board, I'd like to be able to choose which one gets loaded.
2) I wish I could tell my engineers when to warm the torpedoes.
3) 99% concealed doesn't mean that you're hidden. It means there's a 99% chance some random ship is going to sail across the board and start depth charging you.
4) 100% on your torpedo plot means a 100% chance to miss 2/3 of the time.
5) In the middle of a fight you have to pick a crewman, go to first person, find your decoys and walk them back to the pills launcher... yeah, that's fun the first time, and it's also not in the tutorial.
6) Speaking of the tutorial, it's a joke. It gets the basic, basic, basics down; throttle, diving, but not say... how to figure out where the points (given in degrees, minutes, seconds) are on the map... Or how to use any counter ASW stuff... 
7) How about them teleporting destroyers? I mean, I've got it locked up on sonar then 'poof' they're gone.
8) or the way people suddenly decide to drop dead in droves? ""Oh hi, I'm Helmut Schmidt and ugh, so sorry, I've started squirting blood for no reason."" But wait there go two other sailors. No combat, the air's fine, we're not at crush depth to weed out the ones who can't hack it, just guys dropping dead because it's the thing to do. 
9) I have to get off the sub to investigate another sub. It's right over there, but I'll just wander around the deck until I get bored because the way off the boat is a tiny, hidden pixel I have to find... somehow.

This has so much potential so I wish I could recommend it but I cannot until the have fixed some big problems:

Fans in the forum says it isn't a problem with all these bugs ""because it is a small team"" but IMO it makes no difference at all to the buyer if the team is small or not. A small team should stick to a small game if they can't release a big one in a working order, simple.

Graphics are nice, the game seems well optimised ( i dont have an high-end computer ) sounds are very good, music is good too. The 3d submarine environement is very cool but moving through it ( from the side view ) is ,in my opinion, a bit clunky but im slowly getting over it. Time compression works great, Ai seems fine and shooting torpedoes is fun since you can eather calculate all yourself or rely on your crew to plot a solution. 

The tutorial is ok but i had many hundreds of hours at the helm of a virtual submarine so it might not be as obvious to a newcomer ...

Where the game shine in my opinion is that even though you chose your carreer difficulty everytime you go to the admiralty , you have to chose between 3 missions (i believe) which have a different difficulty level so as you get better you can increase your challenge as you feel so progression feels nice. Also the crew management system is very fun it adds a cool dimension to submarine games, there is kind of a ''Darkest Dungeon"" feeling to it: you need to choose carefuly what you bring onboard for each mission and you will learn how your crew reacts to difficult situations as they unfolds (mental breakdown and such). As missions progress, you can obviously let weak crew behind while making sure your crew is filled with seasoned veterans :)

Overall i think any submarine game lover can easily sink hundreds of hours into this product !

I have simply sold my soul to Deep Water Studios. 
This game is pretty outstanding for what it is already and it can, and hope....it becomes bigger with alot of mod material. Most of us Silent Hunter Series Players know some great mods really enhanced those games...But Also...the mods already available for UBOAT are starting to pile in and greatly enhance features, even some mods slightly replicating some Silent Hunter features that some are use to!. 

However...This game has some cool features already built in that i've ran into and yet, every mission I keep finding new things. The more you play the more confident you become with your sub. Some things are simple, some are routine, and when shit hits the fan you really have to throw in some tactical strategies together to overcome or escape death.

being that said, is it fun? is it simple? can it be hard? is it entertaining? will I enjoy this? .... Damn right...... in the end it becomes very rewarding as you progress. the upgrades are awesome, newer torpedoes are  killers.

The A.I. is smart yet fair. let's face it, you run out of supplies, you go home...well the enemy more or less does the same. so it isn't like they are nerfed with unlimited ammo.

more you upgrade key elements of your sub, the quieter upgrades will help. but still...need strategy. 

There will be a time where your friendly uboat gets detected by 
2 Corvettes
1 Destroyer
1 Cruiser 
1 Aircraft. 

All of this chasing him and unleashing and raining down depth charges

while this is happening you are getting front row seats to watch...... yet out of detection range. 

What do you do? 

Help him out??
Leave him to dry and save yourself? 


But who knows, maybe during this event you get some crew member that stresses out and panics....Obviously this isn't good for morale....you just might have to send in an officer to go throw a punch in his face and knock him out cold so he doesn't spread the issue......

but wait....maybe a crew member watching at the scope has a heart attack? better rush to give him some medical support! 

Many things can happen during the heat of battles, then again....maybe just random wear and tear on the crew being confined for long periods...and when you get home they need 14 Days of R&R (which comes bonuses!)

But even more so, eventually a crew member, or multiple may turn south, disobey, fall asleep on the job, and simply not care...well guess what....you gotta discipline option.

Do you warn a sleeping cook on the job? 
Do you make that torpedo worker clean toilets after screwing around playing poker all the time?
Will you want to prison a worker for an entire mission because he decided to sneak off and take naps in quiet places to many times?

Or....Do you simply Execute a bad apple, put a bullet in him and dump him in the sea making the rest of your crew know you aren't gonna tolerate dysfunctional habits which grants you a huge discipline bonus immediately.

By now maybe you are reading this and so far think maybe all this does sound pretty damn entertaining....(as the commercial goes....""But Wait! There Is More!)

How about intercepting a few tasty merchants along your path and follow the sounds of the propellers? as you spend some time tracking and finding them you have finally spot them and thinking great! time to setup and get some tonnage on the record....but then.......

A Radio message comes across of a friendly uboat about 100 miles from you took on some heavy damage and really in dire need of some medical supplies......

What do you do? : Continue to follow and setup to grab some tasty tonnage? Or...Divert off to go get your friends back up and running again.  Because keep in mind, your friendly uboats are out there helping you when needed...

Lets say you are roaming the north atlantic and your radioman comes to you with a message that he hears a very large group possibly 8 to 18 ships in a convoy and you think....hell ya we gotta check this out....and as you intercept a course and try to get rather close...

Headquarters sends you a message that they claim they haven't heard from a specific uboat whom hasn't reported in for some time....however all they have is a last report of location and possibly a scrambled distress....they want you to go check it because it's holding technology you do not want the enemy to get ahold of...

Once again it comes down to decisions....What do you do?

All comparisons to playing SIMS in a submarine are rather accurate. At least for the time being, play at your own risk. I hope the developers can do good job with the early access and hopefully I can update the review one day since there are a lot of cool things that were not seen before in SH, such as wolfpack attacks.

However in the current state, I can't recommend this game. I'm okay with games that require playing a tutorial to get into the mechanics, but I'm not okay with games that simply don't tell you anything and penalise you for not knowing something. For example, you have 3 different lights you can use in the boat, white, red and blue. The f0king button could maybe have a tooltip explaining why the heck my mouth breathing trogdolytes of a crew will go home and cry if I use wrong lights for too long or in a wrong situation.

All controls in the game are ridiculously unintuitive in comparison to Silent Hunter (Do I click this or that with left or right mouse to actually do something??) and in the beginning everything feels like a pain in the ass to get done. 
While UBOAT feels somewhat lika an arcade game, it requires a stupid amount of micro managing.  
Best example of this: I got hit by a bomber plane into the bow of the boat, the first compartment was flooded. The first compartment also has most of the beds in the boat, so my awesome crew carried all the wounded sailors into that flooding room since someone else was lying on the beds in the rear. Nobody starts treating these wounded men or fixing holes without explicit orders for each person. Once the room was fully flooded and all wounded sailors there were dead, I finally found a way to tell my officers to stop sitting around and go fix the leaks, so in they go.

Variables: 
dtT=Target Distance Traveled (km)
min=Minutes of distance measured
Kn=((dtT/min)*60)/1.85

Using well the map you can hit your targets up to 3 km distance

CONS:
 - bugs! They'll ruin your fun and waste your time
 - UI issues and annoyances. Some really obvious ones that you just have to work around
 - lack of scenarios. Oh an incoming message let me guess - a freighter is carrying intel that must be destroyed at all costs OH wow skipper you're psychic
 - early access yes, but maybe a little too much ALPHA and not enough BETA for its price (I got it on sale)

PROS:
 - ALARM! 
 - there's a skill point where instead of calming down a crying sailor you can elect to punch him out
 - most things were done exactly right

Overall I can see that the creative direction was heavily weighted in a way that I deeply appreciate - someone saw Das Boot and said we need to recreate that, lets geek out about it. But there was a mild price for this obsessing in that gameplay is still a little underdeveloped 

One example: there's a UI indicator for most stuff (fuel, battery, discipline, etc) but what's the most important itinerary item on a sub? Ammunition, right? Cos otherwise what's the point. So to open the torpedo menu you need someone on the attack periscope and to go to their POV*, and from there you get a torpedo UI that covers up all the other UI elements on the bottom of the screen. To use those, you need to close the torpedo menu, then to open it again you go back to the sailor on the periscope, etc etc. But to switch the compressor on (a very minor administrative task), from any screen at all you can just hit tab. There's a few things like this that really shouldn't be there.

Oh, and the bugs, the bugs suck. The tutorials are a mess (thankfully gameplay isn't quite as bad) but you really have to be aware of working around them. If you navigate automatically into the port of La Spezia, the sub will ram the wall - you have to slow down by hitting reverse, open the map menu, click on La Spezia again and bang you're in port. Things like that.

But the real thing to take away form this review about gameplay is it's COMPLETELY UP TO YOU. You can play at time-compressed pace all the time and smash through tasks (risky, but you get good at it) and you'll quickly find this boring and hate the game. Don't do that - fast-travel places then do everything in real time. Put on some Marlene Dietrich or Edith Piaf or some 40s jazz and immerse yourself in each mission. It's not about the progression so much as just the experience. And the tension mounts a lot more that way - you have to manage this yourself because they leave it entirely to you.

I can't wait for this to be more fully developed.

And like other have said I wish there was a third option besides thumbs up or down

21/01/2021
Here we are one and a half year later and about a dozen hours more gameplay.
While many of my original complaints remain, many improvements have been made and the game is now mostly playable even if it still crashes more then it should. So as I have had fun with this game I am going to give it a very reserved recommendation to thous that are looking for a U boat game. After all there aren't that many to choice from.

The still not so great:
-I'm rather annoyed by the lack of realistic diving planes (I think it would be much more interesting if the boat behaved more inline with real uboat in terms of pitching up and down and using dive planes and engine power to rise and dive). In general the dive planes and ballast seems to need some work still as a crash dive takes far longer then it did in the real world and blowing tanks and powering to the surface seems to be extremely slow as well (not sure how fast a real type VII could blow its tanks but ). Form what I have seen I'm not sure that boat movement is considered at all as far as depth keeping is concerned.

- The lack of a campaign of any kind is a rather glaring short coming and the mission variety is poor, honestly I would take a campaign gladly over the unlockable crew skills but perhaps thats' just me. 

- I also think the torpedoes still need work as they turn practically on the spot when launched so there is no real difference if you are launching form the bow or the stern. The fact that you have to be zoomed out on the map to see their indicators is also an annoyance. While some might argue that the lack of a line illustrating  the predicted path of the torpedo (the way it is in silent hunter) is unrealistic I would still very much like the option. It would make the transition from crew calculated torpedo runs to your own manual solution much easier.",1563483166,1611263335,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

If you don't know how submarines/naval warfare works, you should watch the youtube vidoes to get familiar with how a submarine and how this game works. 

If you DO know how submarines work, you'll still want to watch the videos to understand how the game works. 

Most of the complaints I've read in reviews are about how annoying crew management is. And I'm sure it is annoying if the crew isn't properly managed from the beginning. See the crew management youtube tutorial and you'll rarely have to worry about your crew being unpredictable. There is a ton of automation so that if the crew is properly assigned their roles and priorities before leaving port, they more or less should be able to run the ship and maintain themselves with little oversight. 

Instead of doing the boring tutorial, I'd recommend just starting a new campaign, and select the easiest mission, a patrol. You'll get familiar with how the game works on your journey to the patrol area, try doing a practice dive, loading and warming torpedoes, surfacing, etc. try to understand how your sub operates so that when you come across your first prey, you'll be ready.

The time flew by for me, and I often forgot to save, and so when disaster struck my crew, who had grown with me, I had no recourse but to restart. It sucked getting the alert an airplane's contrails were overhead, then misclicking the time compression, and having bombs dropped on my submarine before I could react. 

The issue there is the game has a lot of dead space, but the game provides a means to accelerate time to fast-forward you to the ""good"" parts. However, you also get a lot of interrupts for rather trivial information, so you also get into the habit of clicking to continue accelerating the clock. Sometimes, this means you ""rush"" over one of the few important interrupts... and your submarine is thrashed. 

The UI has these and other clunky elements. The controls are difficult to learn, in my opinion needlessly so. To fire a torpedo, you need to match your target to a little book, set a distance to target, the speed of the target, and the angle from which the torpedo needs to exit the submarine to hit the target. The game is very poor about teaching you this, but once learned, a diligent player can rush through this prep, even if these exercises are on-their-face useless. If the torpedo is activated by impact, what does it matter the distance? I've had many torpedos miss one target and hit a distant one in the background, far beyond the ""distance"" input. There is also a sort of Rimworld-style minigame of assigning housekeeping tasks aboard the submarine, chores divvied out among the crew and officers. However, this has very little depth and once set up, I never needed to touched it again. The game elements have some rough edges that only patches and hotfixes can resolve. 

My biggest criticism are the tools that allow you to bypass any and all immersion. From the map screen, you can focus in to such fidelity, you can tell the type of enemy ships from overhead far sooner than you could by periscope or binoculars. It's like if the Nazis had on-demand satellite imagery. If the map screen were a little less informative, if player information was restricted to only the tools available to submarine commanders, that would go a long way to intensifying the overall experience.

The price is low, so its definitely worth a buy, if u are interested in submarine combat.
The controls are good, but you need a couple hours to get used to them, i recommend doing the tutorial missions.
The game isn't finished, but it has good amount of content. I have played 10 hours of the 1941 campaign and im only half way finished. I think it would take 50h to try everything. 

note to developers: I think your game is very enjoyable, and it looks very promising. I also think that if this game is developed much further, it will become the one of the best naval game there is. To reach that state u would maybe need to add new type of submarines, mainly the XXII Elektroboot. You could add a semi-historical version, where the player is able to change the outcome of the war, by completing crucial tasks for the war effort. For example by moving a group of spies to Britain, the admiralty would gain knowledge of the breaking of the enigma code. The players performance could set the performance of other uboats, so if the player is very successful, allied vessels would also perform better. And if the uboat fleet is very efficient and is able to block a set % of shipping it would damage the performance of the allies, and they would loose more key battles. The poor state of Britain could make the Usa more hesitant to join the war and so on.

Apart from this suggestion, i think u should add more priority settings to the crew, so for example the engineer would wake up if a torpedo needs re-heating. Leaders should have a torpedo reload priority setting too.",1611112259,1611112259,True,8,0,0.615526258945465088,0,True,False,True

The graphics are high quality, the functionality of the game from the X-Ray internal camera system, the first person control of any character and general running of the game is buttery smooth and the manual aiming system is top notch for a small company game like this one. I will most likely be repeating all the good things about this game eveyone else has covered, and therefore the same things that has kept me playing for 3 days solid.

HOWEVER. I want to focus on the negative side, because the issues that really annoy me, are issues that have made me rage quit the game a couple of times. I want to stress before I list these issues that I was running the game on 68% realism (I had hardcore aiming, and darker nights turned off).

- More of a PSA this one: Expect to have frame drops in the map. I can run the game on a solid 90fps, but the map will forever be at 25fps for me. Although I imagine that is because of the detail it provides.

- The armed convoys (namely warship protected convoys) are intensely annoying. With a full researched/upgraded U-Boat, the warships can spot me from 9km away. WHICH IS FINE. Of course its annoying since the maximum range from a target you can be is 5km if you are using the T5 torpedo, which is the biggest farce ever. My issue is, diving the 150m or ""maximum safe depth"" as it is known ingame, these warships can not only see me on sonar with 100% effectiveness, and bare in mind everything that makes noise is turned off apart from the engines themselves, but they can track me well enough as I zig zag to drop depth charges and subsequently put 10+ leaks in my pressure hull and sink me in seconds - basically no chance. Now, you CAN go deeper if you so desire - I think up to 300m, but past 150 you are risking damage to components. I find it extremely annoying that you basically have no chance against armed convoys because of these warships. I understand and appreciate the historical accuracy, but considering after spring 1942 next to every convoy has these escorts, it can make the game very difficult to keep playing. especially when, if you are lucky enough not to blown to bits on the first pass, they are following you for 100s of kilometres (I once has corvettes chase me from the top of Ireland all the way back to my base at La Rochelle, and I was sunk and killed 200m from harbour.

- The second issue is with time compression itself. Using realistic travel modes you have then option of Realtime, x12, x48, x1800 and x6500 with the latter two options reserved for non-engagement travel only. This particular probelm occurs when you are submerged and your hydrophone operator starts tracking objects, whether they are ships, planes or other U-Boats. This limits you to x48 compression and will reset you back to realtime whenever you are detected, a new target is spotted or if you spring a leak. If you are just passing through, avoiding escorts or even just trying to catch up to a target, having this occur can be rather annoying as time compression is alternating so frequently that game is freezing momentarily due to the extra processes. It is particularly annoying as this can make completing tasks take 3x as long completely unnecessarily and, if you are running from escorts, just makes my previous point feel even worse. I would propose ending time compression for damages, being spotted by the enemy or consequences brought from low discipline just like normal. But to be able to carry on as normal when a new contact is spotted. This way, you are only forced back to realtime for the things that matter, and not because your friend Fritzy in U-942 has decided to make an appearance nearby. We don't need to stop time every time a target appears on the hydrophone because they are normally 10km away, which gives you more than enough time to react at x48 time compression if you decide to avoid/attack.

Those 2 'rants' of sorts are the only things I have wrong with this game. And since it is still early access, I'm not going to mention the fact that the missions are rather repetitive as I trust the developers will add more, especially considering the changes that have been made. And yes I've looked at the roadmaps. Although not affiliated with it in any way, I believe this is the best contender to carry on the legacy first set by the Silent Hunter series. It just needs a few tweaks.

But hey, it is still early-Access after all ;)",1611107561,1611107973,True,22,0,0.667875766754150391,2,True,False,True

another problem is when i was completing the training tasks, the game would not recognise when i had completed the objective, so i was again forced to restart the mission totally.

The good:
Fun, immersive game of hide and seek. 
Trying to fix your sub after its been hit is fun.
Upgrading the sub and crew gives some direction to the game.

The bad:
Some sort of Witchcraft has to be performed to use the torpedo targeting instruments. 
Most of the mechanics that don't directly involve the U-Boat look terrible. Glitches of function and graphics flat out fail in ports. Half the ships when hit pull a Philadelphia project and slide right through port.
My sub appeared in the middle of the British continent at one point? 
UI needs to be explained and updated to include all features. 
Sometimes too realistic, pretty much if you take more then one depth charge you are dead. 
Damage modeling is really not there yet. Leaks are represented mostly by the red targets and not really by haul damage or other visual indicators. 

I play it, and will continue to, but its clear this is early access. 

These guys could probably move this same engine right into surface combat. Would be a blast to run surface ships in this same type of format with a crew and a ship to take care of. The full modeling of the systems of other ships could make this one more realistic and fun.

Among a tank sim and bomber sim was a game called U-boat. It was a crude game released in 94 before I was even a teenager, with black and white graphics. Sad to say, I loved that game. Then, Deadly Games released U-Boat II, Drumbeat. This was similar to the first release however it had better graphics that were actually in color, better sounds (some of which were taking from Das Boot) and came with a booklet with all the info you needed in order to identify and sink enemy ships. I still have the book.

Anyway, time went on, the games got old and I no longer played them. Fast forward to current time. I am a few decades older and regularly browse Steam for old games I used to play. I plugged in U-boat and up popped this game. I was skeptical at first but decided to get it and check it out. It is eerily similar to the original Deadly Games releases but up to 2019 standards with excellent graphics and more duties, control, options, upgrades, and tasks in order to survive and fight among other things.

To sum it up - you have to be a certain person in order to enjoy this game. I grew up playing these types of games so I love it. Deep Water really did a great job on this one. I can spent what seems like 30 minutes playing this and when I look at the clock, three hours has gone by. I would love to see future updates and releases on this one.

What i can not deal with is the lag. Fast travel now causes lag for me and is too painful to watch. I run a decent PC and since 122 came out it can't handle this game.

This can be a great game but i fear they may not be able to fix this.

121 has come with alot of bugs as to be expected with such a large update. One bug i am having is that officers can get stuck even in fps. Some times that happens to 3 officers at the same time. Either 121 has broken the game and they will fix it (going back to 120), or i need to remove the game from my computer and reload it. I'll keep the thumbs up until then!

I am keeping my original post below but have changed it to thumbs up since a Dev has responded that a new tutorial with saves is in the works.

This review is from someone who has never played a sub sim. I am enjoying this game alot. I have only one problem that is big enough to give it a thumbs down and will change that if the condition is met. We can not save during the tutorial. I have done the tutorial up to ""meet the captain"" about 9 times and then i make a mistake and have to start over from the beginning. I have tried to skip the tutorial and go into sandbox only to learn i still have no idea what i am doing. This is a great game but man let us save during tutorial so we can learn how to play. At least the basics.

Now playing 125. lag is low, saves are fast and loads never fail. Still needs work but damn. what a fun game. I have several videos of 125 to watch at frosty294492 on youtube. Keep at it Devs. A game you can play on the surface or under water, what could go wrong!

January 7 2021 update.
This game is developing very well. It is obvious to me the Devs are still working on this Jewel of a game. I upload regularly to youtube. Saves are at 5 seconds and loads never fail for me anymore and are considerably shorter. I do have a wish at this point in the game. Put torpedoes in the boxes of sunk ships. I run out of torps nearly every mission. I know the Devs want to keep this game authentic but it makes sense enemy ships would have our torps and they would float in wooden boxes!

I have never been a big fan of simulation games, yet this one did peek my interest and I am very positive on how well it does. I will just put it up with a typical pro vs cons situation for me:

pros: 
- graphics are very nice
- weather elements does give different feels and makes do affect your visibility (as it should)
- nice booklet to recognize enemy ships and type
- you can go into first person mode of your officers and control them that way
- possibility to speed up time and pause can be quite helpful at times (especially when in stressfull situation)
- clear indication on why enemies ships might find you so you know
- easy access UI to give commands to officers on what tasks they should do
- Management systems so that officers do tasks on their own depending on how you set it
- Great modding avaiable from the community


cons:
- tech tree is very quick to go through (I had researched everything before 1942 despite the extra penalty time for researching technologies before their historical development date)
- Time on sea: Currently my 'stay' at sea is always approximately 14 days before I have to return to port mainly due to now having any more torpedoes left to fire while I easily still have enough fuel for another 14 days and food provision for 40 days. 
- tutorial: The game does come with some basic tutorial on how to do things, it lacks one big one. It doesn't show you / teach you how to torpedo. I had to learn everything by watching Youtube tutorials and asking Twitch streamers for help. 
- missions: The missions are always the same 3 kind and after a while it become very repetitive. Of course since it's a simulation and U-boats in WWII had pretty much only 1 role, it's something to be aware off. 


recommendations to the devs: 
1) have more tech tree options and penalize it harder so the entire tech tree can't be rushed within a ingame year
2) diversify the missions a little bit so it isn't so repetitive
3) I barely receive missions from the BdU while on sea. I understand it also wouldn't happen to often, but I think there's more that could be done here (especially when it comes to forming wolf packs. After 80 h I have only received 1 BdU mission to join a wolfpack and it was ruined because AI uboats just went into a total suicide frenzy by charging in and killing some ships and getting killed themselves)
4) of course your action on the sea does not have any effect on the outcome of the war. But I could be nice to receive some words of your actions, for example when you manage to sink a battleship you can then read about it in a newpaper that said battleship was sunk

Overall a fairly relaxing and chill game that is quite enjoyable. It has its flaws and strengths but nothing game breaking. If you enjoy other U-boat games, then I bet you'd also enjoy this. There are a lot of videos on youtube to check out and the community (twitch and discord) is very helpful.",1609980039,1609980039,True,169,1,0.904536664485931396,0,True,False,True

This game, UBOAT, is undoubtedly, a breath of fresh air to a long-submerged genre of Uboat simulations/games. The aspect where this game shines the most is crew management. I've only done two patrols at the time of this writing, but as challenging as they were, one thing they weren't, was boring. (read: they were not boring!)

In addition, the devs IMO really nailed the 'Dynamic' time compression feature. What that means is on the 'open sea', travelling time is auto-compressed and time passes at around 7 minutes of 'real time' every few seconds. The result is that you reach your target/patrol area (which normally takes several days in real time) much, much quicker (around an hour or so of real time) and once in a 'battle' zone, the time compression becomes full real again and time passes realistically. It's one thing I wish Silent Hunter series had, as the long journeys with nothing in between really killed those games for me (and yes I know about manual time compression, but I was never a big fan of it). 

Even with the dynamic time compression feature enabled, with UBOAT, even the journey en-route is fun! You get to manage your crew and ensure the galley (kitchen) is stocked properly, and you can even send your crew to sleep or do specific tasks manually if you so choose. Want to warm those torpedoes? Then send one of your appropriate Officers to do the task! Some tasks your Officers can do can also helped-along with up to two assistants who are taken from your crew of Sailors onboard. For those who really love crew management, there is also an 'extended crew management' feature which even sees you manage such menial tasks as cleaning and the like; I haven't yet tried that however as I think I'm satisfied with the current level of crew management that comes as default with the game.

For those of you who don't so much enjoy crew management, this may not quite be your cup of tea (although there is *some* level of crew automation with the shift manager, etc, which I have not really used thus far), but for me, it just adds so much more...pardon the pun...immersion. Plus, in addition to managing crew, you get to be in-charge of ensuring your Uboat's systems are running properly; e.g. having to remember to run the compressors (either diesel or electric option) after you surface from diving and running ventilators and bilge pumps, etc, just adds more to the task list and makes the journey more rewarding. Fuel consumption management is also a big part of the game, and ensuring you have enough diesel in reserve to return back home is critical (pro-tip: running the Uboat's engines at full-tilt the entire way is never a good idea).

And yes, I do manual targeting of torpedoes when the time finally comes to sink those ships. And that aspect of it is well-modelled too. Stadiometer, chronometer, Angle on Bow calculations, etc. In my two patrols so far, I have sunken three Freighters...so not a bad start and I'm very satisfied with this so far! There is also the option to have your crew work out the firing solution if you're not into the calculative side of things, but the automated solution-finding can be quite time consuming (up to 12 minutes from what I have seen, for the crew to get a solution on a target ship).

As of this writing the game seems stable to me and I think now is probably a good time to get into it, now that they have ironed-out many of the bugs that previously plagued this title (although I read that there are still some yet to be quashed...and official release of the game was pushed-back to January 2021).

Pros:
It's not a simulator but rather arcade game but with very nice features that are not present in other submarine games like:
- survival elements - you have to worried about food and fuel
- turn on/off pomps to remove water
- turn on/off compressors to refill air tanks
- turn off gyrocopmas to lower noise and avoid detection and if you forget to turn it on you may get lost on sea
- cut off uboat section in case of taken dammage
- slap your crew in case of panic :)
- a morale management
- side missions like wolf pack convoy attack or helping allied u-boat
There is of course upgrading your u-boat feature and learning a new skills by your officers.

Cons:
At this moment there is just one playable u-boat (Type VIIC) which makes game boring after 1 year at sea when you buy all upgrades. It would be great if uboat Type IX or even Type XXI would be playable as well.
And there are any allied warships near your naval base except u-boats.

Summary:
Game is very nice and relaxing.

There is no real strategic layer to deal with, and tactics are fairly standard, yet it is still quite enjoyable to roam the seas looking for tonnage to lay at the bottom of the oceans. You do make progress over time through the war, improving your crew and your boat and your reputation, but while these are satisfying marks of 'progression' this isn't an RPG or grand campaign. Uboat is just about a dozen scenarios you'll play out in various circumstances, every once in awhile being surprised by a situation you hadn't planned on or imagined, but mostly repeating the same kinds of things over and over again.

Uboat is in the same tradition as 'All those other sub games', but it does it really well. The sound and setting are really nice. Nice enough to enjoy in between more pulse-pounding cat + mouse encounters. There are some very minor bugs still to contend with, but truly minor. My only technical gripe is that the game is rather resource intensive considering its complexity (not that complex in terms of calculations). I suppose most of that is in the lovely graphics but a significant amount must also surely be in a less-than-optimized code base. IE they should be able to do more with less (memory, CPU).

What Uboat does well is what sub games should always do well and that is a good thing: The use of sound, radio, and sight to track down and ambush ships of all sorts. There are plenty of undefended small convoys early on in the war, and there are a small smattering of 'Capital' ships to hunt down through their escorts. There are ports and narrows to raid and sneak through, chokepoints and shipping lanes to exploit.

There are also several levels of detail in terms of targeting available to the player. You can play 'casually' and just put your officers in positions to calculate torpedo angles and they will (slowly) do that, but you can also use classic WWII targeting tools on both the periscope/UZO, and on the map. Thirdly, you can download an authentic replica ""TDC"" tool to make fast and efficient, though complicated, use of the tools that were available at the time. There is something pretty satisfying about calculating anticipated 'AoB' (Angle on Bow), distance, boat length, bearing, speed, and depth of keel with the very electro-mechanical tools of the day, and then seeing it all pay off with some very pretty booms.

You can sidestep some of the difficulties by viewing things up close on the map, or you can play authentically keeping your information limited to what you can directly observe.

The crew management and First-Person modes are fine and do give a bit of immersion to the game that something strictly abstracted would lack. I think die-hard naval warfare fans will really appreciate being able to pace around their sub (inside and on deck) and talk with crew members.

Damage to your sub is extremely well done in terms of gameplay. You must patch leaks, repair things broken by depth charges or aircraft or merely poor driving, and attend to wounded or frightened sailors. When you're resting on the bottom with more water coming in than you can pump out trying to get your engineers healed so they can fashion more repair parts before you all drown, it gets pretty interesting.

Overall as a game I give this about an 8/10. There needs to be and will be a bit more to do in terms of upgrading characters and subs, in terms of missions related to the war itself and in the general variety of missions, etc.. The foundation here is extremely solid though, and there certainly is 'enough' content. There is just room to grow. As a simulation I think it's more of a 9/10. There are some nice ambitious elements that are done well, and the sense of authenticity to both the environment and the equipment is really nice.

This isn't an epic wargame simulating all of WWII, nor is it 'merely' a vehicle simulator. It is a very solid and enjoyable experience and on it's way to being one of those classics that people will measure other games by in the future.

I really don't like writing a poor review on something that has potential, but this is really lacking at the moment. Some background... I love this genre a lot and have been playing these simulations since Atari's Submarine Commander from the early 1980's. I've purchased every Silent Hunter version over the years, and was very disappointed when they started bugging out on newer operating systems. With UBoat, I was excited to see a come back in the genre.  I've put about 6 hours into this simulation, since I purchased it and I find controlling the sub, crew and all the controls very confusing. They simply are not intuitive (for me).  The game needs easy to find (if they exist) tutorials to help familiarize players with major game mechanics and in my opinion a definitive GUI demarcation that helps a player navigate from maps, controls, first person, and third person transitions easier.

He will get you up and running much faster than the ""in-game"" tutorials.

If you think you are just going to fast forward and jump in to some arcade style battles, without doing a little bit of learning first, you're going to be sadly mistaken and extremely frustrated. Take some time, learn the game mechanics, go practice out in the open a few times... then start your big boy campaign.

This game will SUCK TIME. I'm talking 2-3 hours stalking and maneuvering for kills just in 1 mission. Maybe more. You also need to be ready to re-learn some basic math and geometry. Beware of the mods available, most are very buggy. Fun game! Can't wait until the full release.

The people behind this very likely loved Silent Hunter 3. And it shows. UBOAT is basically trying to be Silent Hunter 3 remastered. But not quite.
Let me start with saying that I am not a big subsim-guy, I'm not playing for the realism at all. And this is where the problems start for me. 
See, UBOAT has a brilliant core gameplay. It's fun, it's engaging, albeit sometimes a bit janky and by god are those torpedo hits not optimized at all, it's lag city. Also the UI looks like it could have been ripped directly from Silent Hunter, it looks dated as hell for a game supposedly from 2019. But beyond everything, it's fun, and that is what matters.

What the game currently lacks for me is personality and long-term motivation/a sense of progress. And I think in that regard they could take a bit more motivation from their inspiration. You have the ability to hire your crew and man your sub however you like, but it never really gets deep enough to care. In Silent Hunter, being able to personally hand out medals, qualifications and promotions made me care about the crew, it made me become attached to them. UBOAT has a lot of potential here, with the whole crew being viewable on screen and all, but that potential is far from reached.

Same with the submarine itself. You have a few updates here and there, but no research never really is enough to feel meaningful. It still remains the same sub overall. Of course in the name of realism, this probably can't really change, at least if they decide to stick solely with the XII class.

But, these being my main complaints, as I said, the underlying gameplay is amazing. And while I deinstalled for now, I'm very excited to come back to this in a year or so and look for the improvements.",1608928753,1608928753,True,30,2,0.707395434379577637,0,True,False,True

Started off being super basic, every shot was a hit, and completely upgraded sub in 1 ingame week. Now it is a more indepth, strategy game that requires planning before attacking. Is it the most accurate (historically and physically) submarine simulator? No, but its not bad that it isnt...this game wouldnt nearly be as fun if every single detail was 100% realistic.

The First-Person view is cool for going around the boat, controlling the deck gun (otherwise only every 3rd shots a hit), and performing tasks. However, you will spend most of your time in the Map Scene for transiting, and Third-Person for looking around at the contact picture.

The recent addition of crew management is great addition to the game. You can place your sailors in shiftwork, adjust officer hours, and they manage when they sleep better. They don't randomly go off and do useless tasks anymore, which is great when you need torpedoes reloaded or warmed in combat.

The support from the developers is great, and it's always under modification. With that being said, from one update to another, your previous save game wont work. This is only frustrating if your got far or had a great previous game going. I have not installed any mods, but the third-party support is also pretty good (from what i've seen).

Overall, this game is very enjoyable, but if you stop playing for a few weeks/months, its a great game to just pick back up in and resume (if you can) or restart in a different campaign.

I realize the game is still in the early stages of development and I only spent about $20 dollars on it during a recent sale, so my financial outlay is minimal, but I'm still disappointed in the purchase.  

On the one hand the graphics are quite nice and the interior of the submarine, in which one can move around in the first-person, is quite impressive.  On the other hand, there are several things which I find problematic with the game and/or just plain annoying.  (1) The micro-management feature of the game is a pain in the neck.  No U-Boat captain in WW2 had to micro-manage his officers and crew to the extent necessary in this game -- telling them what tasks to perform, when to sleep, how to set the interior lighting, when to listen to the hydrophones, when to charge the compressors, when to tend to the engines or to navigate, and all the rest.  It's unrealistic, ridiculous, and annoying.  (2) The time-compression feature remains very glitchy, especially on the fastest setting.  Instead of a smooth movement, the sub with jerk forward many miles at a time in ""quantum leaps"", occasionally throwing the sub in the midst of a convoy with no prior warning!  Yikes.  (3) I was recently in the middle of approaching a convoy for attack.  I was on the surface and in the first-person mode of the captain.  For some reason the whole thing just froze up completely.  No matter what I tried I could not get out of the first-person screen.  I couldn't submerge, I couldn't leave my tracking binoculars, I couldn't do anything.  I was totally at the mercy of the escorts of the convoy with -- no surprise -- a tragic end.  I just had to stop and shut down the game.  Not good.

Maybe this game will get better??  At the very least, I hope the developers dispense with the micro-management feature which is absurd.

It was a rough start when I first started playing as the tutorial wasn't fleshed out and the game was so new that there wasn't many content creators making Youtube guides on how to play yet so I had to learn everything on my own. Anyone choosing to get the game now has the benefit of Wolfpack345 and Litely_Salted's videos to guide their way.

I noticed many 'hardcore' subsim veterans were turned off at first glance because Uboat looks like The Sims™ Uboat Edition. But the game itself lets you choose your own play-style. By default everything is automated so you don't have to micromanage the crew if you don't want to, but gives you the freedom to set up your own schedules and tasks for officers if you choose.

You can also play the game from third or first person but map view is still the best way to time compress across great distances. At the time of this review the map tools are fairly primitive but there are many community made guides that can teach you how to plot targets on the map and set up your own torpedo firing solutions.

If you are a fan of sub sims then this is the game to try!  Be aware its still in beta but there is a very active and responsive dev team.  The graphics of the ocean and how the subs and ships move are some of the best Ive seen.  The explosions alone and the way the ships break up make you get a sense of accomplishment when you hit your target.  My biggest issue so far which the devs are fixing with each patch is the crew maintenance.  It can be a bit frustrating with making sure everyone is doing what they should from time to time but it is a great new way to build a sub sim.  You get to know your officers and when things go back quickly you may lose a couple.  You also have a way to keep upgrading your sub through research which is new also which gives the game longevity.  In starting out you will get to pick from three different missions each time your in port and they vary from patrol to spying on ports.  Youll have to take into account the time of day to plan your attacks also.  It makes a difference.

At the time of writing I have almost 50hrs playing time.  The game is basically a simulation of actually running a submarine during time of war.  This means fitting out the sub, weapons, ammo, torpedoes, etc.  It also requires you to chose the food rations and decide what combinations of food should be allowed the cook to create various meals.  The game can be played first person, third person or even by viewing through the side of the hull where you can watch what is going on and give orders.  It is easy to give orders from any point of view, but I mostly use the drop-down that comes from pressing the TAB button.  This seems to be the quickest way to give any of the orders available.

When a sighting has been made, you can allot three of your officers to work on the firing solution for the torpedoes.  However, you can have the option to acquire the solution yourself using the usual tools as per Silent Hunter 4 @ 5.  The graphics are very much better than either of those games.  However, whilst I think the gameplay is better than SH5, it is probably on par if slightly better than SH4.  There are plenty of mods, so you can have the Swastika if you wish or improved uniforms and the like.  

I have yet to find a serious bug and have not had any crashes.  The only thing I would say for the purists is that it does not appear to be possible change the difficulties to a point where you cannot see outside the sub at all when underwater.

I do hope they tweak these mechanics a bit. I wanna plot my route and plan my patrol, not babysit my crew. Also whenever my sub gets hit, all hell breaks lose (that's realistic tho).

I didn`t listen to the reviews... I very much enjoyed the first couple hours of this game. Then i embarked on my first mission: hours and hours of fun! (with an acceptable mixture of bugs) then I realized my last save didn`t work! no problem, let`s go back... my second to last didn`t work either!... er..  ok... let`s go back... nope! that save crashes the game too...

It used to be you would stalk a convoy, attack and the destroyers would come play and drop some depth charges and then you at least had a chance to evade them by hiding on the seabed or launching a sonar decoy or something.  Now it's, in Fed 1940 BTW, you come within 9 cables, submerged, no crew noise, 76DB and riding the seafloor with 20percent chance and bam the carrier detects you, or a plane finds you at 150 ft and then every ship comes over you and swarms and carpet bombs the floor.  Even with a small coastal defense boat you can't evade them anymore, not using decoys, or anything.  Every whisper of a depth charge now causing 6 leaks, your crew the moment they drop under the water starts crying out that we're going to die so you have to put up with whining at the very start of evasive moves, now the game just sucks and you have no chance at all to attack anything other then isolated convoys of 1 or 2 ships.  

Sense they had the wolf pack, how about you give the opportunity to command more then one boat, or have others assigned to you and coordinate an attack.

I am certain you have put a good effort so far, it was quite fun in the beginning but my game has glitched after like 4-5 hours play. I can not command/click any officer including myself, my ship has been lost and I can exactly do nothing. I would gladly share the savegame if you are interested to poke into it. This situation will probably make me not to play till a promising release. I will follow that.

Secondly it is almost impossible to encounter any british ships unless you raid a port full of destroyers... All encounters I have come across so far even though I have spent hours in the narrowest channels, are aircrafts. One exception though! I got an encrypted radio signal which actively gave a location of a target freighter. It was all silent other than this exception around my 5 hours `happy` travelling mode.

In my honest opinion the game is not ready yet and needs much more effort/testing. There are a lot of minor disturbing stuff around such as UI but lets wait for the major stuff fixed first. Looking forward to a major patch to motivate myself to play it again. Good luck to you in the process.

PS: I just would love to play a properly running u-boat game in my lifetime hence nearly all glitched after a certain point including, my old amstrad's silent service and silent hunter 5. That is the main reason I wanted to support this game. Your ideas looks cool so far, but mechanics needs to be fixed and UI should be improved.

Early game load times are fine, but in my experience they slow down considerably over time. 

Moreover, using the deck and anti-aircraft guns feels both clunky and grindy, they sound pathetic, and aside from black splotches that show up on the hull of the target, the rounds don't have any visible effect.  You're basically just blasting away at a bullet sponge until it sinks after having absorbed x number of rounds.  There's nothing fun about it.  Same thing applies to anti-aircraft... no visible damage, you just blast away until the health bar is depleted, then the plane crashes into the water completely intact.

Speaking of aircraft, they don't seem to bank...they simply yaw their way around.

On the bright side, the sub interior/exterior are beautiful, the atmosphere can be pretty intense, and the game really shines on occasion, particularly when attacking large convoys in deep water, but despite its occasional awesomeness, I find myself frustrated by the game as often as not.

As I said, the potential is there, but until I'm confident that the developer will see this through to completion, I cannot recommend purchasing this game at full price.  If you're a fan of sub sims, pick this up when it goes on sale.  

I sincerely hope to be able to change this review to a wholehearted recommendation in the near future, but unfortunately we don't seem to be out of the woods on this one just yet.

New issues:
- choppy graphics during battle
- crew members unwilling to pickup items from storage cabinet.  have to bring them to right next to it before selecting item.

This game as I see it has two types of gameplay, one is more akin to simulation games where you control the crew maneuvering the boat when playing it in a more casual approach, but if the player chooses to, the game can be played more realistically by manually controlling the officers to control the individual components of the boat(in a first person perspective) such as flooding the ballast tanks during a crash dive, or manually targeting convoys using the attack periscope(this one was very hard to figure out without a proper tutorial to be honest, and I had to look up youtube videos to do so, but it was well worth the effort). 

I look forward to the game's release date, I promised myself not to buy any more Early Access games due to the stigma it left me with many years ago but this one seems to be heading in the right direction. One suggestion as the game slowly head towards release is to maybe add in more playable submarines such as the Type IX and maybe include the Type XXI as the war progresses and inevitably ends.",1607191057,1607191057,True,7,0,0.594918429851531982,0,True,False,True

If any of these questions has been answered with a ""yes"", then get this game.

I have played 50 hours of this game in less than a week, and its that good. It might seem complex at first, but there are plenty of youtube tutorials out there and the ingame tutorial is efficient at teaching you the basics.

The simulation feels very realistic and immersive, and having added about 20 mods from the workshop has really added the neccesary touches to improve upon the base game.

I am confifent the game will only improve as time gos on, seeing as its still lacking a proper campaign. But the Sandbox mode does a good job of making it feel alive. Your crew and your captain develop and as you conduct research your sub improves over time and there is a feeling of being part of the larger conflict.

The vanilla tools to calculate torpedo paths still need some work, especially the course-tool is near useless right now and you are more or less to do the course calculations from the map view.

Later sessions have been more conventional, with no passengers, and no change of base (yet).

[u]Review based on an early access version, release B128 up to Hotfix 4[/u]
This is the first release with tutorials, which I found essential - my admiration goes out to to those who learnt the game without the tutorials.

Playing the simplest mode, I have had a Happy Time, going through a few missions, sinking ships, dodging depth charges and returning to port.
At this level, the sub's officers look after most of the complexities of the game.  For example, they can calculate torpedo runs for you.

[b]Good points[/b]:
Time compression: we have time compression, using a combination of sped up time and fast travel to way-points.

We have crew scheduling.  Provided you set up the schedule [i]before[/i] leaving port, scheduling works well - at least, in the early part of a trip. Things can get out of balance after a few encounters, at which point, you have to tell the guys when to go to bed, and when to get up (at least we don't have to feed and water them too).

Aiming of torpedoes is handled by the ship's officers (optionally, you can take this on).

[b]Could do better?[/b]
The worst thing in game (in my opinion) is the need to keep switching the interior light (red, white or blue).
Why?  a) This breaks the rhythm of play.  b) Surely a crew that can manage steering and engines can remember to flick a switch at dawn or dusk?

Is this the only thing that wants improvement? No, but, it is early access and changes are are happening.",1606995670,1606996227,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

On my first patrol where I chased down an enemy target ship which was escorted by several destroyers. The enemy destroyers ended up being distracted by friendly AI u-boats in the area, which gave me the window to chase target @ flank speed on surface. After sinking target, destroyers came for me, but I waited in silence on the bottom. Got away! Then about a day later while returning to base I forgot to keep someone on the navigation station and we got LOST. Dont do this. In the process of re-figuring our position, an enemy bomber showed up and before I could dive he managed to score a hit. This flooded the front half of the ship, and again we went back to the bottom (thankfully above crush depth). Sitting on the bottom for 12 hours while slowly carrying out repairs and pumping water. Learned that water has to be carried by bucket from each flooded compartment to the pump. Pump makes sound, so when enemies show up you gotta turn it off.

As of last night, I had ten hours played, however 31 hours are marked.  The game did not fully close in the background, so now it's thinking I'm out of my (ten hour?) refund time when I may still be in it.  Either way, I had no desire to refund.

The research aspect I have barely been able to touch upon so far in my current game.  I just not have enough officers where I can send one off to research in the HQ.  At a glance, it seems like a really cool idea.  Hopefully I'll be able to mix research and shore leave.

The missions with war correspondents could be explained a little better.  I was able to figure out that when the correspondent had an exclamation point, you need to go find him and tell an officer to talk to him.  Sometimes he will ask questions about the ship you will need to answer.  I missed my first mission with him, as I didn't know this.  I thought, ""Just sink a couple ships, that will make this correspondent happy to watch,""  but no.

Torps do not have marked chances to hit or dud percentages that I can tell.  I've also been unable to figure out which of the five tubes on my ship is the stern facing tube.  Whether or not this allows for better accuracy against a trailing ship is beyond me.  It also seems as though you can load torps into the tubes and then resupply to carry more.  Whether or not this is true, I'm not entirely sure, as I haven't yet counted my shots that closely.

The supply cabinets are pretty cool.  I found I was able to transfer small amounts of food stuffs into the kitchen larder, which allowed me to carry slightly more food on a trip.  I'm not sure if having more food on hand means you can up rations, but I did see a morale boost from having different types of food, which is very cool to see.  

An option to open all supply rooms at once would be nice, to more easily move stuff around.  Only way I found to transfer was to enter torpedo mode and then open the deck gun ammo lockers.  This allows you to see your main storage and the aux storage lockers and transfer things, that way.  Maybe opening any locker or store room could open a screen that simply shows all storage areas at once so you can easily move things?  The only other option I found, for ammunition in my supply room, was to ""sell"" it to the supply clerk at base, and then move it back to the deck gun in the same transaction.  At the very least, the supply clerk doesn't overcharge for goods, so this is free to do.  In base.

As for the deck guns, it would be interesting to be able to decide which type of ammunition it's loaded with, especially when two are available in the ammo locker.  I found the best type of ammo was used up against a supply ship, and I then had nothing to use against a cruiser.  The shooting also seems very inaccurate , even at near-ramming distances from enemy vessels.  Once you're pulled up to the side of a freighter, it should really just get hit.  This 75% of shots splash mechanic is strange.  Having an officer crew the guns instead of enlisted men is also strange.  I'm not sure about Germany in 1941, but that sounds like the job of an NCO to lead a gun crew.

It's awesome to see lifeboats with enemy sailors and goods floating around after a ship sinks.  I wish I knew how to gather that stuff.  Perhaps this could be added to the tutorial at some point?  Ramming the lifeboats doesn't work, nor does coming to a full stop with the lifeboat against the ship near the deck hatch nor conning tower.

Moving around the map begins to be second nature over time.  It's really a fairly simple system.  Moving could be done better, I'm at a loss for why you can only progress time so fast in port.  It makes no difference how fast time is going, that doesn't mean you're ripping out of port.  Seems like a fairly strange reason, to put a cap on how fast time moved.  Firing torpedoes is also pretty easy once you get the hang of it.  Some debugging may be needed to make sure commands are called out, I often don't hear the ""tube flooded"" called out, but I can see the icon shows it is flooded so I know I can fire.  

Stealth on the first sub doesn't really seem to be a thing.  I've tried diving deep under freighters, cutting the engines, cutting really everything making noise.  The corvettes will still end up finding you.  You'd think hiding under freighters would mask the little noise you make pretty well.  Perhaps this gets better with research.  The first U-Boats were really shooting fish in barrels when it came to freighters, so it's disheartening to see so many warships protecting so few freighters.  Maybe this is done for balance, but I really see it as making the early game more difficult than it needs to be.  Early game would really be sinking enemy vessels with free run of the oceans, getting my crew trained up well.  Oh, well.

The medal ceremonies after each patrol are pretty cool.  I'm not sure I need to see ""how far"" each officer is to their next medal.  I guess it's something to say, ""Yeah, you're working on it,"" when no medals are received.  How this affects the rest of the game, or if it's just a fun little extra, I'm not sure.

Promotions and skill upgrades also seem to be unexplained.  Knowing that these are part of the game is great, and I can't wait to figure it all out.  However, it's again stuff I wish was better explained in the tutorials.  Hopefully an advanced tutorial will be released at some point in lieu of people being told to simply figure it out or ask/read Steam community to hear from somebody else that's figured it out.

After all of these mostly negative comments, yes, the game is still highly recommended.  U-Boat needs work, however the game has it's way of sucking you in to the life of the men on the ship.  It's really a modern version of Tides of War, featuring submarines instead of galleons.  The game is immersive, the graphics beautifully done.  I'm looking forward to playing hours on end, always another mission to do once you've landed back in port.",1606678513,1606678513,True,1,1,0.490155458450317383,0,True,False,True

[h1]Pros:[/h1]Graphics are beautiful (The open ocean looks incredible), Uboat is upgradeable which makes it have a sense of progression, Missions are varied for the most part and enjoyable, focus on crew gives the game a really DasBoot vibe (along with little details that pay homage to the movie, conning tower insignia, Long way to Tipperary, this shows the amount of care that went into this game)

[h1]Cons:[/h1] Ports and city's look flat and uninteresting (could be fixed with a pass over though, for the most part you're at sea so it matters less), Missions are great but need a bit more variety (Maybe you could have a fellow uboat help you take on a convoy, or you could save german soldiers from a sinking transport, idk just spit balling), certain things should be done by crew automatically (Compressor, shutting of bulkheads/ hatches to affected areas to stop flooding of entire sub, small things like that), The depths are out of wack in this game, some places are WAY too shallow but for the most part it's ok but could be improved . Game also needs more things to spend in-game currency on like cosmetics or something fun.

10/10 would drown on the ocean floor again.

This game is a lot of fun, it does seem pretty fleshed out even though it's early access.  You can't currently rescue friendly sailors or take prisoners but they plan to implement that in the future.  This game has so much going for it that I can't honestly say anything negative about it.  I run this off a low end laptop and it runs pretty smooth at max settings.  If I were to hazard a guess I would say they are pretty close to finished the game but if you look at their facebook page it seems like they have a lot more content that is coming to give you more control over every aspect of the game.

My current mission, is to try scout out some AA locations at a port, with 3 destroyers in it.  Of course by the time I get close enough to calculate my torpedo solution on one of them I have a crew member who can't keep his poop in a group and then I have 2 destroyers coming to kill me.  What I want to do is launch 5 torpedoes at the same time at the 3 destroyers in hopes to disable them enough for me to avoid death while I scope out the port.  Hopefully that will work, but I need to sort out my crew first and find some sailors with some stones between their legs.  This game really makes you think about how horrible it must have been in the later stages of the war with radar, sonar and cracked enigma codes.

I haven't seen an enigma machine as of yet in my U-Boat but I'll look around in first person a little more to find it if it is there, I would hope that is a detail they don't forget to add since it has such huge historical value and it was the key component to why the U-Boat was so feared.

In short, pretty fun game.  You can travel a long distance if you switch between electric and diesel engines.

- Different tutorials for different topics, e.g tutorial for manual torpedo aiming, tutorial for research, tutorial for crew management and so on, that way you don't have to sit through a single tutorial from start to whatever you wanted to check.""

They actually did it, tutorials are divided up into parts and they greatly explain how you are supposed to play the game.

If you are in the market for a silent hunter-like game, then this is what you are looking for.

The gameplay is pretty smooth and graphics are great, but do not stress my computer too much.
While the learning curve is somewhat steep at first, when you find yourself micromanaging your UBOAT inside a convoy of 100 ships, patiently going step by step to launch all of your torpedos and get as many kills as possible, is intense and rewarding.

Two notable downsides at this stage are:

1. Magically appearing convoys, some of which will spawn while you are surfaced at full steam. (I would like to see convoy generation at ports where ships hold until convoy assembly is complete.)

2. Some of the gun play is rough and wonky. It is hard to figure out exactly how well you are aiming at enemy aircraft and at times almost seems as if you need to lead them by several hundred feet even if they are right on you.
The deck gun is a great way to go after lone transports and finish off wounded ships, however it seems the deck gun is more of an HP hitting weapon, dumping fire into a boat with 150 HP, shooting it 10 times cus the gun does 15 hp damage as an example. The system needs tweaks to AP and HE. It also needs damage akin to the damage torpedo's deliver based on where you hit the ship. I could pour fire into the back of a ship with the deck gun and never kill the engines, but if I shoot a cargo box on the top deck then the ship catches on fire and sinks?

Overall, its a WIP, and I recommend

Man on the AA gun was chilling like a villain ignoring the plane when they flew low and dropped several depth charges next to the sub. Massive explosion later and 1/3rd of the crew is dead or dying. Realized I had to target the plane the same way you target ships or my sailors wouldn't open fire. Sent another leader topside to deal with the plane but it was too late, another set of depth charges followed which seriously crippled the sub. Realizing I was in big trouble if he came around again, I had the absolutely genius idea to submerge just below the surface of the sea. Fate had other plans however because subs with holes don't float well. Sank to a shallow bottom of 60 meters. I helplessly watched as the engineers desperately tried to repair the flooding, and only after did I remember that I should've closed the bulkhead doors to prevent complete loss of the sub.

This is a good game. I found it fun and intuitive. I do not understand people that buy a game in EARLY ACCESS and then cry about the game having bugs or crashing. If you are not ok with losing a few hours of play time wait to buy the game until it has been completed. The game does suffer from crashing but what do you want from a game that is Early Access. I enjoy the crew management  but even if you assign help to your Officers, (lets say West your main engineer) and you want to turn on or off the air pumps West will leave his station and not send his help to do the task. When he leaves his station you lose any bonus you had and have to reset the speed of your vessel. I think it would be better if the officer would send a person helping him to do the other task, and if no one is assigned then the officer leaves his station. Just my 2 cents.

After the first 2 you'll be able to do 75% of what you need to worry about regarding crew management. All his tutorials are excellent and will get you going quickly. 

Tutorials under your belt, once you get used to the UI this is truly one of if not the best sub sim games I've ever played and I've been playing since the original Silent Service in the mid-1980's as well as the old DOS game GATO.  

In terms of modern sims, the amount of possibilities are very appealing with respect to immersion. There are all sorts of random missions from inserting spies on the UK mainland, sabotage missions, port infiltration and attack, as well as missions to investigate a stricken sub (and deal with the aftermath of finding it and it's crew) and I'm sure there are more.  All in all this is likely to become the Silent Hunter replacement for me.

I'm hoping the devs take this engine to add a Pacific US theater like Silent Service I/II and SH4, a Japanese/German Pacific, as well as different German type subs such as those found in SH3. Really stoked and looking forward to many hours of gameplay.

I am supposed to patrol a sector and sink some ship called the Lucy, but anytime I get close to the convoy and identify the ships the travel resets and I have to catch back up to the convoy which should be within 4Km is now at 8km.  I catch back up, start getting a solution, boom, travel mode reset and they go out of range again.  I've done this back and forth about 20 times now and the game will simply not let me catch the convoy and complete the mission.

Edit:

So upon further review I completely restarted the game and have been playing for a few days now and it lives up to the hype. There are still minor glitches, but nothing that really takes away from the game. I have found it frustrating on the ""sink enemy ships"" missions that said enemy ships do not appear, no matter how much I search the area. Maybe I'm missing something, but missions get old when all you do is sail out, float around for a bit and then come back to port. I've found myself picking the hardest missions on purpose just to get a little action since the first two levels result in nothing put practicing my crew management.",1596037383,1604824035,True,0,0,0.503211617469787598,0,True,False,True

It it brilliant, the game has depth, pace and is rather lovely to look at.

Since i have purchased the game there have been huge leaps forward in the game, from the ships and hunting convoys to the progress of the war and how it affects the game for you as a UBOAT commander. 

Another key aspect is, without a shadow of a doubt, the modding. The mods available add a new layer of realism, intrigue to the game and there are plenty out there to make the game truly yours.

HOWEVER...  (you had to know this was coming) the devs really missed the gangplank with dive times.  I was watching a few very recent youtube videos on it and the reviewers were raving about the improved dive times.  Hmmmm   If my crew spots a plane (and I do keep a full compliment on the bridge just to spot planes) I'm dead.   The boat submerges about as well as a cork.  I timed it and giving it full power and emergency dive orders, it took the boat over a minute to go under.  Meanwhile, the enemy planes appear to be cruising along at supersonic speeds and (believe me -- they don't miss with their bombs) are able to get two decent passes on you while you're still on the surface.  If my memory serves, a U-Boat crew could reach a depth of 50 meters in about 45 seconds in real life.  At 45 seconds in the game you're still bobbing along on the surface taking massive damage from the supersonic WW2 bombers that (I guess) reached 1941 through some type of wormhole from the year 2050.

Well,  I have to admit that once you get a few holes in your hull, the U-Boat does submerge rather quickly.

So, as it is...   The first plane your crew sees is going to give you major damage.  As far as I can see (and I've restarted the game 8 times now and can never survive the first plane spotted) there's no way to get past the first or second cruise.

Now, to be fair, the devs are still at it and, overall, it's a great sim that I don't regret purchasing.  But come on guys....   please fix the dive times.",1603384871,1603384871,True,7,5,0.58846205472946167,0,True,False,True

You have to have not just an empty slot but also wrangle the torpedo loader to stop doing maintiance on a torpedo and JUST. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. LOAD. THE ONE. I WANT. YOU TO LOAD.

Making sure your target sinks maybe after a double tap of another torpedo ( if you have time and if it was needed) having a destroyer bear down on you is very tense and again satisfying only if you managed to escape!

From my experience, I only found one minor possible bug but I am not ruling out that it may have been just me doing something wrong. I assigned two helper sailors to my gunner and told them to man the guns (not the deck gun, but the main flak gun and two machine guns). The gunner took the main gun and the two helpers manned the machine guns and when the enemy planes showed up only the main gun (the gunner) was firing on the planes. The two helpers on the machine guns were just idle. I unassigned them and reassigned them to the gunner and walla all three guns made short work of the enemy planes. It seems if I assign helpers to the gunner after I tell him to man the main flak gun this does not happen. If the gunner has sailors assign to him when you tell him to man the flak gun seems they just go idle on any enemy planes around. I found this to be the work around if its just me not doing something wrong so no biggie and doesn't make the game any less fun or intense for me.

You'll enjoy the parts when you're full immersed in the experience, calculating torpedo solutions on merchant ships, evading allied destroyers and scrambling to repair the leaks in your hull when they inevitably hit you with depth charges. These kind of moments when the game feels immerse are quite a lot of fun - and they've helped by the very solid graphics. 

The weaknesses of the game are the occasional lack of flavour - for example there are no sea/land maps that change based on where you are - Greenland and Murmansk look identical to South England. The range of ships you'll face has improved significantly since earlier updates but can feel samey sometimes, it can be hard (unless you're a history buff) to know if there's any meaningful difference between two types of destroyers. Other little details that would really add to the immersion that makes this a good game are lacking sometimes, your 'electric' torpedoes still a steam bubble trail behind them and you have no choice about different types of detonators (e.g. magnetic proximity vs direct hits) and types (there is a homing torpedo you'll unlock eventually but it lacks the historical torpedoes that follow patterns to increase the change of a hit. There are other things I wish were in the game that history included (e.g. allied raids on submarine docks, uboat radar options and most of all different submarine types). 

This game however is still quite fun - the satisfaction you get after perfectly stalking a convoy, sneaking inside it, getting your calculations just right on the torpedoes, launching a huge salvo which rewards you with massive fireballs and smoke plumes as the oil tankers sink to the floor of the ocean is something I haven't found in any other game - the Silent Hunter serious is an obvious comparison but they are extremely dated in both UI, graphical settings and general difficulty setting up. 

Overall a 7-8/10 game depending on how much you love the time period and setting.

 UBOAT the game and the devs that clearly love what theyre doing is still going strong. Major update expected soon.

 The...ONLY...issue I have with UBOAT is the ability to save scum......and I plead guilty to doing just that. The game has gone through some MAJOR balancing updates which ,as far as I can tell, makes SS'ing a moot issue as the difficulty curve is much less hard.

Buy this game if you are a fan of the genre or the movie Das Boot!

Another thing is that you can't delegate certain functions to officers (like the compressor to refill the ballast tanks) and there is no fast way to dive when there's an alarm. To have everyone do functions to go to silent running fast. You have to turn off the gyro and other noise makers yourself. Also, some missions appear way too often, like the abandoned Uboat.

My biggest annoyance with the game in it's current form is finding enemy ships. I start in 1941 in Wilhelmshaven. My first patrol I head close to the coast of britain and to the mouth of the english channel from the North sea. I dive and use my hydrophones to detect enemy shipping and I get plenty of contacts! But to my dismay, I approach the contact and its another german UBOAT. I literally just spent a few hours patrolling the coast of an area which you'd think would be crawling with enemy destroyers and merchant shipping but I find nothing but Uboats. 

There is such a bad balancing issue here. It's almost completely unplayable for me and feels like a complete waste of time. This really needs to be looked at. I would suggest maybe one or two subs being encountered during a patrol and perhaps have the odd mission to meet up with a wolf pack of uboats to attack an enemy convoy. But at the moment it feels like Germany has 500 subs for a every 1 enemy ship. 

I will still recommend this game and give it a thumbs up just because of it's amazing potential. I really hope these issues are resolved and I look forward to downloading it again in a few months to try again!

You have to maintain your food supply, your crew’s morale, your munitions, your fuel, make sure your sailors don’t get sick, it is truly a uboat simulator. I don’t want to say fanatic but I am highly interested in submarines and submarine life. At first, I was skeptical of whether I should buy this game but I’m glad I did. If you feel the same way and have a keen interest for the navy and submarines like I do, then go ahead and do it. I haven’t encountered that many glitches so far and the ones I have were easily fixed or did not make an impact on gameplay at all. I think there could be more things to do in this game such as variety of missions and maybe introduction of different uboats but the game has a lot of potential.

One thing that needs to be worked on, our Uboat found another UBoat which we had been tasked to find and destroy as it was empty.  Idiot officer I sent over to mine the Uboat, detonated the charges sinking our Uboat (no notice received he was on board) - game/system should have waited till we were clear of damage or ask the Capt to set timer for the charge.  Seems a little unrealistic.  

Also crew management can be tedious (even if you de-select it as an option) - for example, if we receive a radio message, crew manning the radio cannot decrypt it, has the be the radio officer or another officer - yet crewmen can man periscope and listening room but only serves to provide you a heads-up.  I think these crew members should take care automatically of all lights, compressors, pumps, etc. if crew management is not selected (kind of automated system).

Im sure im not the only one that wants to play from the other side. I did see that there is a game in the works called destroyer: uboat hunter. But its not the same devs. They missed a great opportunity with that. 

Tactically: this game is excellent

Strategically: theres nothing. Missions really dont matter, there is no long term objective other than upgrading your u-boat. Having an actual campaign with linear missions that effect the outcome of the war....something that is also sorely needed. 

Also, in ww2, u-boat captains did not take on 20 ship convoys solo, they radio'd in to HQ and Donitz sent the pack. That is also missing. You can receive radio messages directing you to help a pack, but you can send any asking for assistance.

Been PC gaming since 1990 with one of the earliest model Sound Blaster cards & running DOS on a Mitac 286.  Oh yeah, I played games even earlier like Pac-Man, Frogger, Pong etc. in the late '70s & '80s, but on older platform/console types or in a shopping mall.  I have been around the gaming block and have played some of the best AAA titles.  I mostly play FPS.

Please look at UBOAT as a good investment ""Early Access game"" that you can enjoy now and pays off even more dividends later.  I had my eye on UBOAT long before it was released for play.  I took the time to read reviews & discussion threads, as well as, watching videos before buying.  Picked it up just before version B122 at $23.  I have loved the game since and it gets better all the time with the updates.

* Graphically speaking, its the best sub game I have experienced. and it gets better all the time.
* The mod community creates some excellent stuff for UBOAT and mods are ridiculously easy to implement.
* Bang for buck/replay value, UBOAT is in my top 10 of all PC games ever played after 30 years.  Better potential than the SH series in many areas and it's getting better.  I'm waiting for the top-down 2D map addition which will come.
* When you read reviews, TAKE NOTE of hours on record.  Most negative reviewers have barely played UBOAT.
* The overwhelming majority of us UBOAT owners have not experienced in-game crashes, save game loading issues or other problems.  In over 750 hours or so of gameplay, I experienced only one crash & one save game issue (which I learned the reason for both & have not seen either since).  Neither had anything to do with the game itself. Ummm . . . .  User error or not paying attention!
* Take your time, play it slow & learn.  Patience is a virtue ""grasshopper"".
* There are plenty of helpful players in the discussion threads who will help you.  Be positive & don't rant.  Just ask.

The last patrol involved dropping a spy off near Cardiff. It was so tense sneaking out from under the noses of the British Patrol Boats. It's definitely a bit easier than SH3 - but enough of a challenge for me using the excellent TDC mod. So far I've avoided enemy warship contact so have yet to experience the rigours of the damage control aspect of the game which looks excellent from the vids I've watched. Not come across too many bugs at all so far - nothing game-breaking - just cosmetic - and that may be down to the mods i'm running. I only played SH3 before  but to my surprise I'm finding the crew management to be quite enjoyable. Gives enough to do while pootling about - but not an issue during the actual engagements. Can't help but find myself doing a bit of role playing as I get the engineer to hurry up warming those torpedoes!
I reckon you could break the game with the deck gun - its probably too easy - but I've preferred to try and use torpedoes for the most part and just used the deck gun to finish a ship off or chase down a runner on the odd occassion.
Slight annoyances - 1. I very often find I can't get on the observation periscope (blocked by NPCs), 2. May be me - but my torpedo salvos (only tried with 2) only ever seem to hit with 1 torpedo amidships. May just be my lack of skill - but it's happened I think 3x now. Should I aim off centre for a salvo?? 3. This may be to do with the TDC mod but every time i switch to/from map view the guy on the periscope puts it down and I have to raise again and re-acquire the target.
Love the graphics (runs decently on my pretty old rig on 2nd highest level), love the tension, love the music (das boot mod), enjoying the crew progression. Not a hard-core sim I'd say but creates the tension better than SH3 and the patrols have been pretty varied so far (patrol sector, tonnage, experimental torpedoes, spy drop-off, deliver spares to u-boat ...). It may be early access and feels like there's a lot more to come with the game but well worth the 20 quid for a bit of lockdown diversion.",1599340497,1599340497,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Be warned this is total different beast from the Silent Hunter Series. Whereas other well established WW II sub-sim ( SH III ) focuses on combat  and tactics, U-Boat  focuses on the crew and ship management. 
Managing the crew (healt, moral , dsicipline)  , the boat (repair, improvment, housekeeping)   and the enemy (combat , detection, stealth ) is as importent in this game. It brings a brand new focus and gameplay of what it felt like to be part of the Kriegsmarine. It also opens a lot of new features :
- complete control of the boat
- Human / crew focused 
- inventory management / repair 
- new missions (inflitration , rescue, sabottage, hunting)   

Pro :
Gorgous graphics and details. 
Great sound
Crew and ship management 
3 rd and 1 st person view
You can visit  the entire boat, every detail is there

Cons :
- Odds controls , can be misleanding and cause some precious time loss
- A few bugs left
- IA acts oddly sometimes
- Situation can too quickly degerate
- Firing solution questionable


This game does not replace SH series in terms of tactics and combat, and should be seen  as a great complement sub-sim , and a genre of its own. So Do not compare it to well established existing Sub-sim.  
If SH III could be considered the Best Tactics and combat u-boat simulation, U-Boat is the best crew-oriented WW II simulation.",1598984330,1598984330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game either freezes or crashes to desktop.  On the forums, deleting previous save games was offered as a workaround, but this isnt a real solution (and didnt work in my case anyway)

3)Many patrol quadrants are completely empty of ships and you can travel thousands of kilometers without sighting another ship.

My impression is this game is in part an homage to Das Boot and a grateful nod to the giant forerunners of the sub sim genre, SH and Jane's, upon which massive shoulders this game stands proud thus far. 

The art and detail of the sub is striking, with period-correct gauges festooning the machinery. The handing characteristics also were well designed and modeled, and it's impressive to see how it gets roiled by the ocean: watching the rudder gauge as you sail through a storm is testament to the thought put into the environmental mechanics. And the ocean! It is something to behold, with waves cresting far over your deck as your tiny sub is roiled by Poseidon's wrath. 

The missions are thus far pretty engaging, but of course there aren't enough of them (yet), I'm guessing that there will be campaigns in the production release, too. But just surviving your first mission without getting blown out of the water by a Beaufort-dropped depth charge feels like a great accomplishment, so I'll take what I can get now. 

The current build (127) seems to be mostly stable, I've had only 4 crashes in about `140 hours of play time, so saving often will still be a recommended strategy. But for its alpha play state, it's still pretty good. 

Given its early access state, there's still plenty of work to do for the devs, from polishing up the art (those rubber rafts, man...) to the trees and foliage looking a little 8-bit up close, but this game is certainly playable and enjoyable so far, at least for my part.

[list]
[*]The discipline gauge is basically broken. Your men are well-trained battle-hardened sailors of the Kriegsmarine in a supreme weapon of war renowned for causing fear and destruction, but they start crying if they have to sit in to help the radio officer listen for messages instead of playing cards all day.
[*]There should be several changes to the interface, inspired by SH4. Firstly we should tell the men to go to battle stations, not have it automatically declared (am I not the Kapitänleutnant here?). When I say we are safe I want to cancel the alert and stop having the crew fret and drain energy and morale when it's not needed. Secondly, the changing of the light switch is micromanagement too far. It should automatically be changed by a sailor to red at night and back to white in day, with blue when I select battle stations / silent running (we can hardly go on high-speed time compression if every 20 seconds we have to zoom all the way in and search for the light switch). Also we should be able to setting a course through a compass heading and not just by plotting waypoints on the map. 
[*]The rest of the micromanagement is good, there should in fact be more of it but a [b]MAJOR[/b] missing element is the ability to actually use the devices yourself. I want to use the hydrophone and mess with the radio, not just watch my officer do it for me. Going around the boat in first person should mean I can interact with everything manually (like in Wolfpack). I want to turn the valves, open the torpedo doors, seal myself in my bunk and rub a sneaky one for Mrs Fritz back home (no?), and basically feel like I'm on board and making a difference to the running of the sub.
[*]The boat is far too empty. Watch the film Das Boot and you see how insanely cluttered and packed with supplies it is when leaving port. It should feel claustrophobic but for now all we have is two swinging hams on the ceiling. This isn't helped by the fact whenever you walk close to several pieces of equipment they go transparent. Why??
[*]The time compression is [b]incredibly[/b] annoying. If you come close to a shore or any ship of any side, the compression slows right down, which is fine, but there is no way to speed it back up again! I know I'm close to a shore, I plotted the damn route. Yes I see the ship, I don't care, let me sail. But no, instead you have to sit at miserably slow speeds and wait for the open seas again.
[*]The radio has effectively no music so relies completely on mods.
[*]The map tells you the precise depth of the sea in every inch in the world. Hardly any point in pinging the seabed if I can see it on the map, is there?
[*]Sometimes you can do an entire 'successful' patrol and not meet a single enemy vessel.
[*]The damage model on both the sub and ships needs a lot of work. Blasting an 88mm shell from the deck gun at close range directly into an enemy hull will hopefully do more than make a hazy black splotch on the side of the ship in the future.
[*]Enemy destroyers are dumb as hell. You can make as much noise as you want and their sonar/hydophones wont detect you. Also, forgiven as it's early access, but for now none of the ships have any detail when you look at them, static crew, and are missing effective spotlights.
[*]I've never once had a dud torpedo. Who knew they were so reliable? Also the depth setting is completely broken and anything but default is a guaranteed miss. There are no trails in the water either when using steam torps, and when loading any torpedo from storage they appear in thin air, and when prepping them you can have two crews clipping on top of each other working in the exact same space!
[*]Resources needs balancing. After one good patrol you're a millionaire and it has no more impact on the gameplay. Also, the fuel might as well just be free. We can't play the game without it and having it costing 10 to refill is pointless. Bananas cost more.
[/list]
You can play this game just from the map with having your officers do everything while you float above with godlike knowledge of the sea and everything in it, which is fine if that's what you want, but to actually get properly involved it's lacking. It could be absolutely great in the future but I don't want to have to rely on mods to make this playable, interesting or fun so I sincerely hope the devs don't think this game is anywhere near complete.",1597914680,1597992975,False,266,19,0.853963494300842285,5,True,False,True

This could easily be a stunning ""nine"", but a variety of things need to be developed/fixed before releasing a full game. I'll start with the good things: 1) Good looking (interiors, U-boat itself, water reflections, etc.) 2) Fantastic balance between submarine & crew management simulation 3) Full of technical details 4) Brilliant WW2 Vibe. Now, what prevents this game from being 100% awesome: 1) No real, fully prepared campaign (I know this was implemented as a Sandbox Game, but it still feels a little repetitive) 2) Broken economy 3) Bugs and glitches haunting players constantly.

In terms of the submarine warfare I would say it is less complex in certain ways than Silent Hunter, but in other ways there is a lot more thought involved. Here's my experience- started off with the tutorial. Had a little trouble with a few bugs that did hinder progress but if you do EXACTLY what the game tells you, nothing more, you will get through the tutorial and learn how to play. Once I loaded up a sandbox game, I was really surprised with how much better the functionality is than in the tutorial. I've yet to have a major problem with the open world mode (knock on wood) and it's given me hours and hours of fun. If the developers can iron out a few of the kinks during early access and maybe add some more unique missions, then when this game goes out of early access it'll be one hell of a game!

EDIT-
Having played UBOAT for a reasonable amount of time, I still stand by what I said earlier. I will make a pro/con list to sum it up


----PROS-----
+Unique and Immersive gameplay experience
+Offers limitless gameplay for hours of fun
+The modding community is already at work with some very helpful and game changing mods
+Very customizable crew
+TDC mods make for a great roleplay experience
+Not overly complicated (easy for players new to sub sims)
+At higher settings, excellent visuals (ocean, ship, weather)
+A more 'living; environment than silent hunter
+Game launcher makes activating mods super simple
+Easily accessible console commands if need be 

----CONS----
-Gameplay bugs (be patient, it is an early access game) such as the deck gun just not working
-Poor optimization (needs a very beefy computer for high settings)
-Somewhat repetitive
-Not a lot of variety in crew or ship name (there are mods to change this!)
-Although the crew is highly customizable, there is no vanilla way to really make your U-Boat 'your own' so to speak",1568589567,1597778458,True,12,2,0.653574168682098389,0,True,False,True

And for extra entertainment for u-boats should have accurate year dates displayed. My best idea is to unlock other u-boats in a future update. This game so far is the BEST I've ever played, Though I would really appreciate the fact to install a better expansion to have Type IA 1933 date or Type IXD/42 (like U-883) and you turn the tide of battle in some expansions. I hope they create and install the other u-boats from Silent Hunter III and IV and V as well. Lastly included in the expansions with the U-797 Type XVIII u-boat and type XXI u-boats also. Lastly SM U-boats from 1906 to 1918 for coastal patrol missions would be a big play to practice your skills before WWII begins. Thank you UBOAT makers. For everything!

At the current state (B127 Hotfix 4) UBOAT is very much playable and enjoyable... enough so to leave a genuinely positive review.
That being said I'll skip the general description as you can find enough content elsewhere to figure out if the game is for you. I strongly encourage you to do that just for the simple fact that submarine games in general tend to be a niche genre. Also since UBOAT lacks a tutorial I would highly advise to check out some of the YouTube content regarding the matter, including manual data gathering for torpedo solutions. It's certainly more fun and rewarding when you do it yourself (aside from it being quicker and better coordinated)

What I will do is focus on some peculiarities and gripes I have with the game. Personally I find the negative stuff much more informative than pointless praise (even if it is justified).

First, as a native german speaker I find the fact that all the officers you have to deal with in ports address you in the informal 'thou' and that the quartermaster SELLS you military grade equipment like as if he ran a black market operation endlessly amusing XD. I seriously hope this never changes.

What I could certainly do without are sudden convoy spawns right at my location. It only happened a few times but can be quite annoying when it happens, particularly when the escorts detect and start hunting you down. I made sure I had the watch fully manned on every occasion (in one case it was a clear day), so it's not a matter of poor visibility.

Speaking of visibility this game is way too dark for my taste. I fully get that you're not supposed to see much bellow the water surface... I'm not arguing that. I'm talking about the fact that way over half the time it's as dark as pre-dawn or late evenings on the surface. I keep double checking if I accidentally activated ""Darker Nights"" from the options menu (which wouldn't make sense anyway since I'm talking about 0600 - 1800 hours). A rainy day at noon looks like dusk. That's a shame because the visuals are quite nice to look at. No need to hide them.

There's definitely too much micromanaging going on. It's certainly necessary - even desired - when setting up an attack run, evading depth charges or dealing with some sort of crisis or extraordinary situation. However, I don't see why I have to tell each officer individually when to go to bed, reassign another officer to his station and transfer crewman from the sleepy guy to the one taking over during voyages. I'd call that more annoying than fun and if you made the mistake of picking realistic travelling speed you will exhaust yourself dealing with all these issues before even getting to your assigned patrol sector. Ideally I would like to see the removal of energy drain as an option. Sure, without it UBOAT becomes more arcadey but in terms of gameplay I'd consider it an improvement.

The micromanagement problem is best displayed with crash dives... which curiously do not have a hotkey (yes, there is a button in the UI and you can pause the game, but still...).
What SHOULD happen is to increase to maximum speed for the depth rudders to be more effective while filling the tanks. In fact, the Type VIIC was somewhat famous to be able to dive quickly if need be and reach a depth of about 90 metres within 30 seconds after the command was given. I'm not sure if engine speed even factors in to diving times but I'd be lucky if I get the boat even fully submerged in that time. The last time I had to do it due to a sighted airplane it took almost 2 minutes to get to periscope depth, at which point the vessel had suffered a rightfully deserved direct hit. Oh, it sank well and quickly afterwards.

The latest build somewhat addresses some of these issues with added crew management options, shifts, a customizable priority system and a quick select option via the TAB key to have regular crewman do some menial tasks like turning the gyrocompass or the compressors on/off. While this is much appreciated, it is unfortunate that neither the lights nor the snorkel are included in the selection and ballast valve operation isn't even turned on in the crewmen's priority list by default.
Also, while you can permanently assign crewmen to an officer to assist him, I don't quite see the point. I'd rather have a task automatically have a set number of crewmen assigned to. Alternatively (or rather additionally) automatically free up any assigned crewmen that are unable help an officer at that moment because the activity doesn't support the amount of assigned helpers... like when the officer in question goes to bed. I don't need two of the guys singing him lullabies and telling him good night stories or whatever it is they're doing aside from creepily watching him sleep like sociopaths while complaining that they ""have too much work from officers"".

Next: decimals. The game seems to hate them in regards to the torpedo solution.
When attempting to launch torpedoes at a target, you need to find out a couple of values besides identifying the ship: range, speed and course. There are several ways to figure the data out yourself or have your officers calculate it automatically.
Unfortunately when the data is put in, it is displayed rounded to the next integer with no way of finding out what exact number is set. Suffice to say that since ""2 km"" can mean anything from 1500 m to 2499 m, it makes quite a difference. The same goes for speed, particularly at longer ranges. The only value that displays one decimal point is course... which ironically, if you're off by 1 degree, it won't make much of a difference. Just for the sake of double checking the calculations it would be helpful to see the correct values.

And lastly time compression and returning to port. I'm not sure how many ports we'll get further down the line. So far I've been stationed in La Rochelle, Bergen and Wilhelmshaven. Boy, is it a chore to return to your home port, especially the last two.
Time compression slows down drastically when close to the shore, which makes leaving or entering port take forever. Bergen stands out the most due to the somewhat fjordic coastline of Norway and the difficult angle you need to hit to get to the mooring spot. Wilhelmshaven isn't far off. I've grown a beard, shaved it off and regained a stubble before the boat was secured.
Sure, if you WANT to do that manually, go for it. I'd much prefer a checkpoint similar to the existing ones, maybe close to the shore of the port, that lets you autodock/leave quickly and get you to the open sea in a reasonable time.

Very fun and enjoyable now, with tons of potential as this game is in early access(and contains bugs). Watch a youtube video before you play as the in-game tutorial isn’t updated yet !!!

First off I want to let you know I am writing this review as a lover of sandbox and management games, my favorites being Kerbal Space Program and Prison Architect. I know many reviews of this game are from people who enjoy other submarine games such as the Silent Hunter series. I am not one of these people, I have never played the Silent Hunter Series and this is the first Submarine game I have ever played except maybe World of Warships (lol)

From my point of view as a more casual gamer, I absolutely love this game and it has a lot to offer, even right now, in its early access state. I first came across the game a few months ago and ended up not purchasing after reading reviews saying it was unstable, constantly crashing, and had too many bugs making it unplayable. I came back to it last week and read through the reviews and it appeared they fixed a good chunk of these issues so I decided to buy it. Right now with about 30 hours in-game I have not experienced any crashes or major instability and have been playing it on a mid-tier gaming laptop, not some crazy beefy gaming PC. I know some other players are still experiencing these issues so I can’t speak for everyone but personally I haven’t had them. 

Being an early access game there are definitely still bugs. However, there is a great in-game bug reporting tool (hitting F11) that will let you send a bug report in-game along with your current game state. This makes me feel heard as a player, I can report these bugs and make sure they are noticed and eventually patched.

Pros

The graphics are phenomenal, the interior of the sub is beautifully modeled with amazing attention to detail.

Very good strategy aspect. While attacking a single freighter is easy, you have to plan out attacks and strategies for an attack on a large convoy, for example

Great resource management aspects. You have to manage your ships fuel, food, and ammo to ensure you are always ready for attack if an enemy pops up

Great crew management. You can choose what roles your officers have on your ship and what crew is assigned to do what

Great gameplay. During battle, you control different officers in order to do tasks such as spot targets, drive the boat, load torpedoes. This isn’t like World of Warships where you just click on a location and expect your ship to fire

Cons 

Lacking a campaign. After a while the missions get boring and they’re all kind of the same, a campaign with varied missions would be much more enjoyable. Currently, there is not one but I think the devs are planning to add one.

Bugs. I haven’t encountered major crashes but I still have had issues with gameplay bugs that do break the game occasionally

Broken Mechanic/Balanced Mechanics. I feel as some mechanics aren’t properly balanced and it can be frustrating sometimes 

Missing a decent tutorial. Basically right now if you want to learn how to play go on youtube and look for a tutorial (there are tons of good ones) I know they are planning on adding an updated tutorial but as of right now we don’t have that

To anyone interested in the game I would really suggest watching youtube footage before you buy it so you get a sense of how to play. If you are still on the fence due to bugs or lack of a campaign I say wishlist the game and get it at a later update

The visuals are great and I really enjoyed the RPG elements such as the HQ system for researching upgrades. If you're looking for an experience closer to SH then there's always ZNC's 'Real TDC' mod (which the Devs have actively promoted in a recent steam post) which improves upon the more basic manual targeting system the game offers.

There are still a few bumps here and there. I find the recent crew management system a bit confusing which has discouraged me from using it (despite me watching some tutorials on YT, or maybe I'm just dumb), and more than once I've been frustrated when a merchant vessel I'd sunk would refuse to register as a kill (commonly when the ship sinks in shallow waters and rests on the bottom).

Some more options for this sort of thing might be good, like manual navigation, etc. (would require lots of new systems in the game, but just for example).

It does a great job of making you feel like you're in charge of a crew, and makes the ship feel alive, rather than just giving you the feeling that you're piloting some kind of autonomous U-Boat.

Needs some work and quality-of-life improvements, but the devs seem to be active and attentive. One suggestion is being able to skip time in port until research is completed.

Pros: 
- general ambience feels authentic and emersive 
- Fantastic graphics, specially the water simulation
- beginner friendly
- Not as dry as other sub sims due to addition of boat and crew management
- already very active and friendly modding and fan  community
-the game really shines in in survival  situations while trying to prevent the U -Boat from sinking. 

Cons:
- So far only one submarine type available (More seem to be coming though)
- German voice output needs improvement, both on the quality as well as the quantity side.
- Missions feel a bit repetitive after a while.

It's got to decide if it wants to be a subsim or a Uboat version of The Sims.  

The time compression needs some work, they should scrap the dynamic and just have it scale like Silent Hunter.

But not in its current form. there are still many bugs and some missions are very hard or enterly impossible to play. For instance sometimes on patrol 1 or more enemy destroyers or MTB's will suddenly spawn right in front of you within 1km. This have the effect that you are instantly spotted and shot up to bits. while sometimes you are lucky you are able to dive (and sink cause they do hit you) they somehow magicly know where you are under water. and when you check what it is that is causing the detection it says your hull is 3 percent visible while beeing 30m below and that is what is causing you to be detected. Not sonar, not radar (yes even radar can detect you under water sometimes, like how??) but when i am 30 meters below the surface a ship can AND SOMETIMES will detect me with 3 percent visibility. This is even when my periscope and snorkol are both stowed away so that is not causing the detection. And this only happens when ships are spawning into you direct area i have noticed. 

This also bothers me alot. Why do enemy vessels and airplanes just spawn randomly near your location? if they spawn they should at least spawn 4 km away from you in order to react to the danger by diving or engaging or a combination of both. No they litterly spawn 300 meters away from you and sometimes when you are lucky and RNGezus is with you the spawn 1000meters away so you can hit the throttle and escape or something while taking heavy fire.

Another point is that i find that most missions are rather repetitive. i mean it is not up the level of Preston Garvey but the amount of freighters loaded with crucial technology is just stagering. Or checking on another Uboat to again read that the batteries have failed and you must sink it.  it is rather boring after 80 hours. 

The issues that needs adressing
- detection system
- enemy units spawning near you in mission area
- This on is the most important: More variation in missions
   - like to hunt down destroyers/ battleships,  aircraft carriers and
      enemy submarines in late game 
   -  brining orders to another port 
   -  providing port defence on attacking enemy vessels
   - have regular breakdowns ( i mean german engineering is good, but not THAT good)
- and overall make the game more vibrant, not sail to there sink a freigter job done and sail back to port

But on an ultra wide monitor its starting to show its age. So I brought UBOAT.
I must say for a pre release game its really good and I am anticipating it to surpass SH3 on its full release.
Things I like:
Quality Graphics 
Programmed in Unity (modablity)
Wolf packs and the ability to direct to a limited extent other uboats.
Mod work shop (this alone will allow it to surpass SH3/4/5) 
Mods already available (before the games released!!) additional music, port updates, traffic and actual ship names, actual crew member names, etc,etc.

Thing that needs adjusting/some thought:
Is a bit easy to sink stuff due to the initial easy mode set up where torpedoes don’t miss much however:
A brilliant TDC computer is already available (thanks Ruby2000) that transforms the game.
Crew management can be a bit of a pain to keep track of but this has different levels, from crew just do what needs to be done, too I will micromanage them all the time.
Freighters need arming, escorts need to be more intelligent.
I cant believe how good this pre release game is and I am sure it will surpass the silent hunter series in  the very near future.

I like the idea but it has a poor UI that does not present important information. Sure you can find it, but as a new player, I have to pause the game and think how to get the game to do something. That is never a good thing. 

I HATE the zoom. HATE, HATE, HATE. The zoom should be smoother and not jump around. I gives me a headache. 

I just rage quit the game because while on my mission I get the message, ""One of your sailors died."" Hmm that is never a good thing. I wonder what killed him? No one knows. I was sneaking up on a port and not getting shot at. Maybe there is a sniper out there (joke). Bam! I get another message ""One of your sailors died."" Once again, hmm I wonder what killed him. While I am trying to figure out what has just killed 2 of my dudes, my sub went off course. Had to correct that. Bam! ""One of your sailors died."" I am a bad captain because I have no clue what is killing them. In total I think I lost 5 sailors. Just before I quit, I zoomed out to see if I was getting shot at. Apparently there is no other way to tell. I didnt see anything happening.

I figured well I will try again and load an autosave and try again. Hmm there is no auto save... I have to start over hours of game play. Nice.

Edit: I wanted to mention a few bugs.

1. Got the captain locked in his binocular view wile on the conning tower. I think it happened because I pressed the key while he was on the ladder.
2. Every once in a while the game does not let you plot a course. The course line just jumps around the map every time you click it. 
3. Caught up with a big convoy that had 3 escorts on the back side (it was big enough that I never saw the front). The escorts were 1 corvette, 1 destroyer, 1 cruiser. They saw me and I made a run for it. I got away but stopped at the limit of hydrophone range. They were still looking for me some, but they then appeared to stop looking. I came to periscope depth and decided to take on the cruiser. It took a long time to get a solution, then I noticed all three escorts weren't moving. I thought it might be a graphical bug. I got the solution and fired at the cruiser. Hit, ""minor damage"", Hit, ""no damage"", hit ""minor damage"", hit ""no damage"". I made a run for it but marked the map so I could finish him off. I came back to the markers, nothing was there. I found the convoy and guess which 3 escorts were on the back end? 1 corvette, 1 destroyer, and 1 GD (gosh darn) cruiser. 4 torpedoes broadside into the cruiser and nothing.... I mostly quit playing after that. The game is still too buggy.

Edit #2 
Another thing I hate is that there is nothing to spend money on, not really. You have to go on land missions to unlock stuff, but the mission screen is bugged and the icons disappeared from the map, so I have like 100,000 to spend and nothing to buy. 

Also food is never stocked enough. I can get 1000 tons of fuel, but the supply officer only has 12 bananas, a few cans, and 10 strips of bacon for me to buy. You have to buy them, time warp, go buy what ever he has, time warp, go buy what ever he has, time warp, check again and buy what ever he has. Takes forever to get a full galley and storage. Just unneeded button pushing

And HE and flare shells for the 88mm are NEVER stocked. Always plenty AP. on a side note, I wish there was more to the deck gun. A better sight and hit locations on ships. I would love to hit the engine room, or ignite cargo causing an explosion. Something or anything really. All deck gun battles sound like this - boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, ""fire on the deck"", boom, boom, boom, *fire goes out, boom, ""fire on the deck"", boom, boom, boom, *fire goes out, boom, boom, ""she's sinking, yay!"".

I down-voted Uboat bcus I was having issues with my GPU freezing etc. Found a way to work around this by frame limiting to 30FPS via AMD. The game has not crashed once since and I also run it on extreme graphical settings. I am currently using Free Sync and honestly I don't mind the 30fps. It is not a fast paced shooter after all. ( I believe performance tweaks should be addressed though!)

Although not a pro sub-simer I have played silent hunter 4 back in the day and find Uboat to have so much potential! Taking care of the crew is part of the experience and a nice addition. (In case you don't like this feature I am sure it can be taken care of by some mods)

Overall I think the game is accessible to newbies like me who want to get into submarine simulators but also for veterans of the genre with the realistic campaign settings.
The accomplishment feeling I get from the game when I manually calculate the target speed distance etc and then manage to hit multiple targets within seconds away is amazing.! 


Workshop+++
The fact that this game has workshop available with hundreds of mods is amazing. 



***** Old Review *****
So, do I like the game? Yes! 
Can I play it? No! 
Can I recommend it? No!

The game crashes a lot. I got it to run for 20 mins without crashing once while in 1600x900p 60fps.
So unstable plus It felt like it was frying my Gpu! I was getting 45-70% gpu usage when playing but the gpu temps were very high for some reason.

My Specs:
Rx 590 8gb
Ryzen 7 1700
Ram 20gb

That said, there are mods to increase some of the realism aspects, and they work quite nicely. But don't get the wrong idea.

Its certainly not finished and there's a lack of content which can make the game pretty samey right now.
I find some of the camera views clunky and a bit of a fiddle to get right.
Graphics are good without being great, although the interior of the sub is very good and true to life.
Crew management is a great idea but in practice it needs some more work to be reliable.
Too much time is spent on the map screen to my liking but again some small tweaks here and there would fix this.
That all said I've enjoyed the game a lot and will continue to do so especially as the third party mods have improved quality of life.

I'm a sucker for visuals in games, and the water rolling off the sub after resurfacing or crashing through a big wave is soooo satisfying to see. Sadly, you don't get that bobbing feeling when in first person mode, but you probably won't pay much attention to it when you see how incredibly detailed the interior of the sub is. Shout out to the designers, because holy hell did they do a great job.

There is a realistic mode, which enables you to play in first person only, collisions on, realistic bilge (water build up in the sub from leaving hatches open during downpours, taking damage from ships, or colliding with objects/ships), manual aiming (without the aid of crew members), no detection icons (meaning not being able to tell how loud your ship is, if you've been seen by enemy ships, etc.), and some other features. I plan on doing a play through in this mode, once I have gotten all the mechanics down pat and know what I'm actually doing.

I don't know if there was a co-op mode, as I didn't pay attention when I launched the game. If there isn't, there NEEDS to be. Having a crew of actual players, all focusing on navigating, listening for radio transmissions, keeping the engines tuned, and the torpedoes prepped, loaded, warmed, and ready would be an AMAZING experience.

Speaking of crews, you have a team of 18 crew members, 4 or 5 of which you actually command and control. You have a Chief Engineer, who keeps up the diesel engines, a mechanic who preps and primes the torpedoes, a radioman who tends to the radio transmissions, and two captains who focus on navigation and observation. I believe there may be one other one who can be made to be the medic/chef who makes sure everyone is healthy and taken care of.

The tutorial that comes in the game is outdated, and they make sure you know it is when you try to play it. They recommend you search up a tutorial rather than using theirs. Their tutorial doesn't cover a lot of the newer features they've added since it launched, and they are in the process of creating a new tutorial to add to the game to include the newer features of the game. 

I recommend watching Lite_ly Salted on YouTube, as he did an awesome job at explaining all the small features in the game. I watched it, and played along with him, and actually managed to sink my first freighter on my first playthrough using him. Highly recommend him for sure.

I haven't really encountered any bugs in my first 4 hours of game time. I had one issue (which was my fault), where I ended up not paying attention while looking at the map and hit land at 48x speed, which caused me to get stuck and forced to restart (happened not too long after sinking the freighter, was trying to get back to the docks before I ran out of diesel.)

All in all, I absolutely love this game. It's obviously early access, so give it some time, and hopefully the developers stay dedicated to it, because they have a great foundation for a potentially groundbreaking game.",1595737806,1595738314,True,24,0,0.728363275527954102,4,True,False,True

Don't do the tutorial, it's a waste of time. I went on Youtube and watched some videos at 1.5x speed to get the very bare bones, but just get in there and figure it out! It's a little overwhelming at first, but just go to the guy by the car and ask for the easiest mission. By your 2nd or 3rd mission you'll be an expert I promise. The only thing you'll probably want to watch and pay attention to is how to manually fire torpedoes until your crew is a higher level to do it faster.

I see some people reviewing it about crashing often, and their issue with no autosaves. While this is an extremely anecdotal review, I have had exactly 0 crashes. The game feels pretty CPU intensive, and I have a 3700x so maybe that is why I have no issue? It's just rendering a lot, all the time. Especially when you're in 'travel mode' going at the speed of light. 

Other issues I see people have: no autosave. My answer to them is thank God honestly. There's been so many times I'm thrilled there's no autosave, because I go full ape mode and need to rewind. The trick is on your keyboard, push F8 and it will quicksave. There's your save issues resolved. Find a smoke column? Save. Entering a harbor and don't want to lose everything? Save. Testing if you can use your uboat as a battering ram? Save. The game isn't going to dictate when you should save, that's your responsibility. 

Lastly, bugs. Yeah. Bugs are expected in any early access game. Bugs are prevalent in anything made by AAA companies as well (looking at you EA / Ubisoft / Activision.) These ones are minor annoyances that just require a game restart, nothing game breaking for me.

Overall, I've had some memorable moments playing. There's a lot of detail put into everything (I was so surprised since I got this game for $20), and if you have any itch to play a game where you can play Barbie dress up with a bunch of rugged German men while sinking ships and taking no prisoners, this is the best one available. 9.2 / 10

Personally, I've never played the top dogs of the subsim genre like Silent Hunter, to which many critics of UBOAT will compare it to of course, to which I will admit that UBOAT isn't quite as realistic as SH and focuses on the crew management and open world survival gameplay elements more so than the actual simulation of the submarine. Don't be fooled though, the game still recreates the Type VII in amazing detail, with many parts still accuratly recreated, and with mod support, someone has a mod that will give you a fully realistic TDC which maximizes realism when engaging convoys. The mod support introduction overall made the game more astounding, with various mods to customize your game with including sounds and new submarine skins/emblems.

Let's get back to the base game though...

Overall, I have to say that UBOAT is right off the bat, worth the money if you're looking for a dedicated subsim with dedicated developers that have a planned roadmap along with future plans after the full release. The game combines those great crew micro management elements, with the subsim theme, and is directly inspired by Das Boot, I mean the first boat you will probably pick in this game is going to be U-96 itself, complete with laughing sawfish on the conning tower. UBOAT may not be for everyone, maybe you don't like the micro management of your crew, there are mods to help with that, like mods that ensure your crew will never lose discipline or hunger or fatigue so you can just focus on patrolling the North Atlantic sinking convoys. Overall, I say you're missing out on a very good subsim if you pass on UBOAT...

Let's just summarize everything about it...
Pros:
-A full detailed and beautifully recreated Type VII for you to command, this thing is seriously modeled so well in this game. I'm not sure if we will see more submarines in the game eventually, like a Type IX, but just this one model must have taken them a while to put together, it's absolutely gorgeous.
-Your crew are not just robots, you as a skipper have to tend to them and take care of them outside of keeping your submarine in order, you may see this as a pro or con.
-RPG style levelling of your officers, they level up as you complete orders from command, and you can teach them skills that will aid in your future operations, you can also send your officers on research missions via the Headquarters, these missions take a certain amount of in game time to complete and they unlock upgrades that you can mount on your submarine, such as snorkels that allow the diesel engines to be used while submerged, or a new conning tower with more AA guns or armor.
-A massive world to explore, I wasn't kidding when I said this was an open world survival game, there's also things to kill you in this massive world, convoys may have escorts, you may be attacked by aircraft, which could mean an aircraft carrier is nearby, or you may come across a battleship, there can be a whole lot of boring, endless sailing in this game but that can quickly switch to full red alert before you even know it.
-The game uses a section view of the submarine that is nifty for operating your whole crew and overall just conducting jobs on the submarine, the section view allows you to easily keep track of everything that is happening on board your sub, and it's quite pleasing to look at due to its cutaway style as you zoom in on your boat.
-Speaking of views, the game also has first person, you can directly control one of your officers and explore the sub in their point of view and conduct operations manually, like using the periscope to identify and track, and eventually attack targets, or turning on pumps or compressors, or switching the normal lights to silent running blue or alert red.

Pros:
-Sometimes it can be boring just sailing around not finding anything to shoot at but that is the nature of these kind of games, and that peace and quiet can easily go to full red alert whenever.
-The game handles alright now, but it is not for low end machines, it is a very pretty game with some the best looking water graphics I've ever seen, but it's not potato friendly.
-It's early access, so bugs are to be expected when dealing with such a product, but at the same time this game is 90% more complete and fleshed out than most early access titles on Steam.
-Docking can be a NIGHTMARE, especially at night time, i've had lots of trouble docking when returning from a mission, there's no icon that pops up when you near your spot in the port, you have to kinda blind eye it, just find the spot you remember your boat being parked at and stop near it and see if the game docks you there, hopefully they sort this out. This is a big issue when transferring to another port, lets say La Rochelle to Bergen, and you have no idea where to park your boat.

Nothing else off the top of my head....
Overall, a very solid subsim contender, there are so many more features I've yet to talk about because of how numerous they are, plenty of videos out on YouTube that explain better than I can, but overall, I say you are missing out if you don't give UBOAT a shot. As of this review it is 18.99 on sale until the 31st of July, seriously pick this game up if you have any interest in submarine games.",1595392363,1595392363,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

What i would like in game is;

-I would like to purchase submarines superior and late tech than mine. 
-I would like AI is more competetive. As of 23.4 hours i've never been detected by destroyers or anything undersea, never not even once, and man i massacred allied fleets, literally massacred.
-I would like more ports, and each port has different technologies or equipments. So i would travel to create monster sub.
-I would like to stop fast forwarding whenever i wish. Sometimes i want to collect all T5 torps, but warehouse has 3 or something. I need to wait days after days to fill, but when i send my crew to vacation, i cant stop fast forwarding to resupply from warehouse. It is wasted 14 days i could replenish my sub.

Bugs i encountered;
-1 blue screen of death.
-while fast forwarding, sometimes day is stuck at day 14.
-sometimes when i click save, there is an error to try again later. Mostly docked in ports.

There are numerous issues with optimization and saving that constantly pop up and are seemingly left untouched for months at a time.

In particular, you will find that a regular occurrence in spite of many updates is to eventually no longer be able to load saves. You'll play 3-5 missions, actually start to get attached to your crew, and then the game absolutely refuses to load any saves from that campaign. This has been a problem for a long while, and there are references to virtually this exact same issue from nearly a year ago in 2019, and dozens of complaints since then across multiple versions, and it still hasn't been fixed. For such a game-breaking bug to still be present in virtually its exact original form for nearly a year, this doesn't spell good things for the game's long-term development and makes me very wary.

In addition, there are significant optimization issues that will completely crash the game during major incidents in your submarine, such as a collision with another vessel, or a large number of damage notifications from being hit. These optimization issues have also been a problem for some time.

The other issues with the game are relatively minor and easily attributable to early access, so I won't comment on the current state of the game with regards to a lack of mission variety and so forth. I expect more content would likely be added in future.

It's a great shame, because gameplay-wise, it's like a more accessible version of the Silent Hunter franchise, it has interesting mechanics that suit the gameplay well, and the AI is even relatively decent (save for when ships collide with each other). It's a good idea overall, but doesn't have the execution it needs.

Here is a list of things I noted down from my time of playing.
1. The UI was not intuitive, not user-friendly.  It took me a while to get used to the controls.
2. The tutorial was buggy, I couldn't complete certain tasks and was stuck multiple times
due to blacked out compartments inside the submarine. (Fixed after restarting game)
3. I spent so many hours trying to get this game to run smoothly, it's not very optimized. (For some reason I get better fps in window mode)
4. I struggle to get tube V flooded. I kept getting the message, ""flooding tube V,"" but it was never flooded and can never be fired. Sometimes I can fire the torpedo without calculating torpedo solutions. (Fixed after restart)
5. The firing mechanics is a click, wait for NPC to calculate a solution, and fire. Not very.. engaging. 
(UPDATE) there is actually manual TDC where you can manually calculate the course, speed, and distance of target ship to fire a torpedo. However, I wished I can load multiple solutions without closing the torpedo menu. The torpedo flooding mechanic is also buggy.
6. Pre-Heating torpedoes.. does it really work? I pre-heated all 4 torpedoes, all 4 did not explode from 1 km away. 
(UPDATE)Turns out that T2 is unreliable, only use T1, T3 for long distance targets with multiple ships close to each other. Use T5 for destroyers or closer ships because it is guided by the sound of the ship's propellers.
7. I struggled to get back to port, and could not complete my mission that I spent hours doing. 
8. When the submarine is damaged, so many things.. so many icons are popping up, it is so distracting! I don't even know what to fix. (UPDATE) sometimes when a module is already repaired by an engineer, the broken red icon still shows until you restart the game.
9. Do I need to assign crew to do all of the small tasks? like refilling the air tanks when submarine is surfaced? (UPDATE) you can assign crew schedules and roles.
10. I had problems with the submarine rudder and movement controls, they would not respond. The problem was fixed after I restart the game. 
Overall, it is was not a pleasant experience and I understand that the game is incomplete, but I will still give this a thumbs down until the game is finally enjoyable for me. Feel free to give this a try!

This game is certainly not for the faint of heart, nor is it a game for the 'ADD' crowd. It is a 3-D chess match between you, your crew, and the world. Just when you complete a dozen patrols and think you are a bad mamba-jamba - a lone corvette comes along and before you can say 'Plot a Resolution' you are shark chum.
I will say that there is a certain satisfaction sending a defenseless cargo ship or five to the bottom of the Atlantic though. Nothing like getting a few medals for putting a torpedo up the aft of a heavily laden vessel filled with GI Joe toys.
This game is a long slow burn, but a very rewarding one. I confess I had to save-scum a few times to ummm... correct my mistakes, but that's okay. It is extremely fun, incredibly challenging, and a (insert superlative here) good play.
I look very forward to the completed project, as there are a few bugs to work out. It IS and Early Access, but far more ready than 90% of the Early Access games out there.

I bought UBoat when it launched on Steam in 2019, and after 2 hours promptly refunded it, disappointed by the experience and with feelings of hope dashed. But here we are a year later and like its namesake, this game has been slowly sneaking along submerged in early access and is ready to launch a salvo of torpedoes into my stale collection of blue-collar simulators.

UBoat is finally beginning to realise its potential. The Life Aquatic inspired cutaway submarine is a masterstroke of gameplay immersion. The seascape is beautiful. The crew management, stores management, and uboat system management is engaging.

Its been made moddable and has Steam Workshop integration too, this is a real boon for an old electronic submariner who'd rather spend time sailing the virtual seas than plumbing the depths of mod installations.

I'm not 100% sure if there is an open ended campaign a'la Silent Hunter III, I think it's on the 'to do' list. But it's worth it for the beautifully modelled submarine alone.

UBoat is a WWII sub sim that takes the game and adds a good dose of personality. The game features the ability to manipulate any of the crew members operating within the boat. This in its own adds to the already tedious operations of the Sub itself.
Starting from the title page I will break down some things of noteworthy contention.  in the beginning the game offers three boats to choose from with a specific starting location. The boat is fully manned (minus 2 crew members...I will get into that later) and awaits your interaction to talk with command to choose from three different missions with the rewards associated with fulfilling the primary objectives. The selection is from what I can tell is somewhat random but with varying degrees of difficulty, you can tell by the base rewards for each. After selection you have the options to outfit your boat with extra provisions, such as food, repair parts, weapons and the like. This where they got this close to what it was like, the amount of resources you can bring with you was space available limited as well as provisional costs, which you start with 6000 units to purchase these items with, including extra torpedoes. While in the game as you accomplish things you earn these points, but for starter captains this is the base amount you get. In reality this would be equated to money that has been allocated to your boats command, provisions were purchased with your budget. The acquisition of extra torpedoes usually fell into the squadrons allocation funds. The use of prestige points to acquire all items is a bit easier.  
Once you have the extra provisions you want, and I do recommend a few extra food items for moral purposes, you can speed through the loading of such items with a click of a button on the main screen, an option will appear once you have made a purchase. The loading of items takes time, especially loading more torpedoes from the warehouse. This will change the time of day and decrease visibility if the load out finishes at night, not to mention any rain storms that can happen. My only takeaway from this is that the charts you use to plot out of an area, is darkened as well. If your going to do a up a chart of the local area, it will be easy to read for the navigator at night or day. Plotting your course on said chart is easy enough, the darkening of the chart is just not right, I would fix that to have lighting effects to be lit more or the chart details to be more pronounced.
While underway the time scaling is very nice, nothing worse than waiting around for nothing to happen while in transit. When in deep ocean areas the scale is quite massive allowing you to traverse the ocean areas very fast. 
While transiting to mission points the game has random side missions that happen via radio messages, doing the extra work gets you extra prestige points and gets you used to operating the boat. This was a nice feature that was a certain factor while doing actual patrols. The metering of O2, Fuel, Battery power, and moral is a critical piece of information for any trying to be successful out at sea on a boat.
While in combat tracking down ships (targets!) is mostly easy. the only thing I did not like was the ship and boat indicators on the chart while zoomed out. The ship indicators should point in its known direction or at least have some sort of enhanced arrow indicating the direction. This applies for your boat and any targets about. Only when you zoom in on the chart can you see the direction of yourself or others, and if its dark out the chart is dark (at night, or in bad weather). I have encountered some odd things while attacking a pack of British destroyers. First I had damaged a destroyer with a torpedo in the aft section of the ship, rendering half the boat underwater and still able to maneuver and change speed. In my personal experiences in the Navy I view that to be a bit far fetched. Mainly due to the fact that most engine rooms if damaged and fully submerged don't quite operate at all. The effects of seawater filling a compartment full changes not only buoyancy as well as crew operations and their ability to mitigate damage and equipment operations. Destroyers of that age were thin hulled and easy to flood... even nowadays destroyers are not that well protected. Maybe fix the games ship internal structuring with critical destruction points like the bridge, engine rooms, ammo bays etc.. 
The other attacking issue I had while launching torpedoes at these destroyers was the reporting of the time to detonation on a torpedo track. I had launched at about 1000 meters and so the Torp had a small distance to travel. The game gave me a halfway report when the torpedo was almost at the target. The torp missed but was still being time tracked and noted as a miss well past the proposed impact zone. 
Another issue I noted was the overall coordination of this destroyer group, after scoring my initial hit on one of the destroyers the other ships (2 others) just kept going. As being one on my crew in the Navy and being a lookout during all levels of weather conditions and time of day, I know for a fact the other destroyers would have visually seen the explosion. Visibility was well past 5 km at night, not to mention they did have radio communication to speed up fleet issues...in most versions of destroyers with the usage of sonar they would have heard them very easily. 
Which leads me to the detection range of my surfaced sub, with diesel engines running vs. electric engines. The decibels seemed to not change at all when shifting to electric engines, which is when a sub becomes more stealthy, curious. that needs to be looked at and fixed. Maybe the db was changing but not indicating or I was blind to some indications (doubtful). Here is something very basic about sound propagation in water, its highly efficient and fast in comparison to in the air due to how close molecules are together (metal being one of the most efficient) to transfer the sound wave... which is why in space sound is not transferred.
Some good things to control in the ship were the various damages that can happen through combat let alone collisions. De-watering the boat even during normal times was a cool addition for the ones that choose to micromanage that effect. The addition of this water changes the buoyancy of the boats bubble (the angle of the overall boat) while submerged, which makes depth keeping a bit tricky and potentially deadly.

The overall graphics of the game are average with the boat itself being very nice. There are some parts that could be refined but all in all it is workable/playable. I have only done a few runs with only seven hours of operating this game, so some of this will change in time hopefully. I will update as I go from here on out. Please comment as you see fit, I will respond in kind.
       
  **************************************************
This is an update as promised as to the overall game play of UBoat after my initial review.
Earlier I had mentioned basic selection of subs in the beginning selection screen. Come to find out the selection is a bit more than 3 subs, its about 10. they all are of the same model type from what I can tell (type VII). All have some difference of past successes varying the initial reputation points to use for purchases.
Other things I have gained notice to are three varying mission types that HQ offers. The top option is usually a candy patrol, with awards that correspond to that level. the middle selection sometimes offers extras such as another officer to add to the crew, and increased rep points for usage in port. The bottom one is usually the more appetizing of the three as far as reward goes. with three tiers of rewards associated to the overall requirements of the mission. Such as patrol distance within the patrol box.",1593645350,1593981439,True,223,2,0.931693851947784424,4,True,False,True

The sub management for resources and crew works quite well and I like the fact the fact the difficulty is scale-able depending how you want to the experience various aspects - for example you can set the distance speed, approach angle and type of ship you're attacking our use the auto function and let your crew work out the finer details. and if you choose the manual option you can have 'lighter' nights to make target acquisition at night much easier. The animation detail on torpedo hits is very well done and spectacular from whichever angle you view, it's very satisfying to down a destroyer with a single midsection hit to the magazine. the The game has been fun to play and I've mostly enjoyed the experience....

Here's the but.....

The game is broken when it comes to loading saved progress.  I've saved the game at various points and after around 3 or 4 missions worth of progress the load screen hangs and requires the game to be reset. It hangs to the degree that even the crash handler for error reporting freezes and doesn't package the error data passed 20%. Yet if I load to an earlier point there's no problem and the game loads flawlessly.. This makes the game unfortunately a bit laborious as I you basically end up playing the same missions over and over.

UBOAT is one of the best simulators for its function to place you inside the actual submarine, rather than a detached strategic view. The default view is in a spectator mode, but there is an option to force first-person, which means you must be controlling a character at all times. In first-person mode, your character can be switched to another sailor. I have never used forced first-person, but I imagine it would make the game a lot slower and more difficult.
The information you are provided is no better than what the sailors can produce, so your boat is often at the mercy of the unknown when you are in a fight, such as total darkness when submerged deep.
The grim simulation of managing the entire boat definitely hits hard when you're trying to control your staff, food rations, fuel efficiency, and repair parts when you are out in the middle of nowhere being depth-charged.

I'm not a subsim player at all. I consider myself to be a green player in this type of game genre. Bought this game when it was on sale and here is my simple review:

pros:
1. very supportive community to get you have better understanding on how to play the game.
2. superb graphics
3. very addictive once you understood all the gameplay mechanics
4. even though it is still under early access stage, but so far things are going so well! kudos to the dev!

cons:
1. tutorial is outdated and you really really really need to watch guide videos on YouTube before you start playing.
2. travelling from point a to b is quite time consuming as the travel mode only available on certain areas of the seas.

The in game aiming functions take too long, a lot of times it takes so long that by the time its at 100% the enemy ships course has changed and you end up missing and running out of torpedo's right away.

On my way to YT I stopped at Steam Forums. There I learned this game is not about combat but about hitting trade ships and run. I was looking for more of a stealth warfare type game. It is my opinion that a sub should get more involved in real stealth combat but for now the devs are not going that way. They paint it as a prey on the helpless and run like cowardly dogs. I am sure subs did a lot more than that. 

This review will be labeled refunded soon and that is fine. I went into this game hoping for a good Sub game. What I got was something that felt very rough and unplayable but not in the normal sense. The existing tutorial you are told by the devs not to use. There are no tooltips that are useful to figure out basic things like diving. So you go on that first mission and well what is a sub that can not dive? An easy target is what you are. 


So this might not be a bad game I do not know. I do know it is not the sub game I was hoping it to be. Something as simple as sit in the captains chair and bark out orders if I so choose. Could not even find such a thing.

As a fan of the historical topic and subsim fan (starting with Silent Service in the late 80ies, heading on to Aces of the Deep and the Silent Hunter Series in the 90ies and early 00 years) I was very curious how this one would be, when it was announced.

When it was released about one year ago I found a rather edgy and rough game with lots of bugs and almost unplayable, but with high atmosphere and potential of growth; that‘s why I kept my eye on it.

Meanwhile more than one year later, I have to say Uboat has developed very much. New patches brought some very useful additions and conclusive solutions. Furthermore, meanwhile there are so many excellent mods bringing in additional features making the experience even more atmospheric. At this still early access status Uboat already surpasses the last Silent Hunter (5) title by far.

The detailed presentation of the Boat and the interior are one of the best I’ve seen in this field. The convoy battles and the weather system are put in scene quite impressively. Mission designs are adequate, altough some of them don‘t seem to be historic accurate. Crew management system is ok, but still a bit rough. I‘m very happy the developers brought in an award and medal section, making the game more motivating.

What I didn‘t like so far is that the ports look still a bit unfinished and not quite lively; buildings look rather vector based. Face options and mimic art of the crew is very very woody. Landscape textures are already improved but still rather rough. Very unrealistic seems the fact that some torpedo-impacts make ships (e.g. corvettes, destroyers and smaller merchant vessels) „jump“ totally out of the water. Aircraft attacks still seem imbalanced.

What I would wish for the further development would be improved port graphics, the announced Uboat Bunkers and improved face animations. Furthermore some animations when the Boat get‘s supplied in port (e.g. when torpedos get loaded into the sub) would be great. Better balancing and diversity of vessels would be an enrichment.

Overall at the recent developmental state Uboat is already a very atmospheric and detailed subsim/crew management game with still high potential of growth; not forgetting the many excellent mods. Developers and modders keep up the excellent work, making this one an AAA-title. 

If you like Films like „Das Boot“, subsims and the historic topic I highly recommend to take a closer look at Uboat. It‘s a great experience in this setting.

I got this game right when the early patches of the 127b hit the unstable branch. So far i really enjoy the game. I love the feeling of sneaking up to a convoy undetected and then raining hell upon it. Then quickly getting out of dodge because the destroyers did not like that i was sinking tankers and cargo ships in their convey that they were supposed to be protecting. 

My favorite moment had to be being being in shallow waters on the southern coast of the UK getting ready to sink ships in a port. Then this little torpedo coastal craft torpedoed my boat. Beaching me in very shallow water. Then 4 more torpedo boats and a corvette decide to use me as target practice while I am beached dropping depth charges and launching torpedoes into my sub until everyone died.

They're trying to fuse the management of The Sims, with Silent Hunter through the base building of Xcom. It's a good idea and i want it to work. Unfortunately, it's just so clunky. I'm fining basic navigation difficult as a single click deletes all your waypoints, combat is virtually impossible as all but the most ideal conditions will see your periscope visibility to <100m, The management is kind of difficult and the interface for controls is confusing and counter-intuitive. 

I'm certain that this game will get better over time, and some things that would greatly help would be a simpler UI, a button to click on the map when you want to set waypoints rather than just Right click, a change to the periscope setup so that i can look through it easier and a more straighforward way for me to command the ship in the Antfarm cutaway. 

I've tried picking this back up again and again. It's getting better over time, but my god the controls are so clunky and almost unworkable. 

give the development team time and they'll produce a great game, i'm sure, but for now, unless you're a hardcore subsim fan, it's best to play something else. Pick it up on discount or wait for further developments, but as it stands, it seems this one needs more time.

Waited for updates, and then wanted to try again. The game is now at update b127, there are some good tutorials by players on youtube which you can follow along to, this helps but there are still issues.
Sadly for me the inability to play the game in a room during daylight hours spoils some good improvements. The idea that the realism has to be such that at night in the game you cannot see anything unless you play in a darkened room goes a little too far. They even darken out the map around the submarine if you are plotting a course at night. If you were plotting your course inside the submarine you would have a map light and be able to see what you are doing.

-Time Speedup (core part o/t game) makes the physics buggy at best, fe ships go flying if torp'd during speedup, game tries to combat this by forcing you into realtime when it manages to guess a torp is about to hit, aswell as limit how much you can speedup when near other crafts or shoreline. This gets very, very frustrating.

Right now, there isnt a campaign (though you do have progression through upgrades you can research & crewskills) 
neither a lifetime tonnage tally (only for each mission, NOT sortie)
& patches make your old saves obsolete regardless so having to start over at some point becomes accepted.

The game is fun, lot's of fun, and I enjoyed my hours spent playing it and for that reason I do NOT regret buying it when it released. However I will also not recommend anyone buy this while it remains in Early Access. My ENTIRE cumulative play time in this game has had the save files wiped via updates. The most recent was today with nearly 20 hours lost to an update I had no idea was coming. I understand that Early Access means things like this will happen but I'm over it. The game has been out for nearly a year and it's a bad joke at this point. Losing my save files was why I quit in October 2019 and it is still a thing in June 2020? A developer reply in the patch comments addressed this as being too many changes to roll over stable saves. I understand that aspect but I am done with having to either choose between much needed quality of life improvements or lose the hours upon hours already played.


(Original review - October 2019) This is a tougher thumbs down to give. The game has a ton of promise and it's really, really fun... when it works. This thing has been getting progressively worse in terms of game bugs and save killing bugs. Which is really weird to see something develop into a worse version than what is was 2 months ago.

Looking at the game for what it is, I hope they develop a better way to move items because the UI now can be a mess. The clogs at the hatches where all the NPC's try to get through can sink the ship in an emergency. The ""alarm"" scenario's are a ton of fun. Getting bombed from being spotted or having to dive to dodge enemy ships is a ton of fun. When the game works and you're out there sinking ships or hiding to survive, it is a great time.

I have some faith in the Dev team. They communicate well enough with the community and have a variety of ways to report bugs/issues which is great. But until the game becomes genuinely playable and you don't lose 5+ hour saves constantly, I will keep it as a thumbs down. At some point though I believe this game is going to be one of the best WW2 Sub sims out there and I look forward to it, it's just not there atm.

(Review update - June 2020) So it's been quite some time since I played and I wanted to see what the changes were like. I haven't been able to put in as many hours as I had before so I've not engaged in all the scenarios I am familiar with. There are things I still dislike that I figured I would get out of the way.

- The new upgrade system is the opposite in difficulty it was before, then too easy and now too slow
- Getting lost is an awesome addition and definitely welcome but it should correct faster when surfaced in clear night (sextant positioning)
- NPC clogs at hatches are still a thing
- If I send crew to sleep then the workers I had assigned at their station should just unassign themselves instead of giving an overworked penalty
- New radio stations but no new songs on old radio stations, which sucks to listen to since you use it to boost crew morale/discipline

But now for a list of things I like so far:
- Improved ladder climbing
- New designed missions and rewards, getting new officers to send to HQ for upgrades or testing those upgrades on the mission
- The item UI is now better and faster to manage in the side overview
- Some minor graphical improvements that add some arcade style realism
- Checkpoints to get you out to sea faster
- More customization options for cosmetics
- Ability to take out different Uboats that spawn in different times of the war as difficulty options
- Save stability seems to be better, we will see if a patch wipes out another 20 hours 

All in all I am living up to my word and changing my review to a thumbs up because I do believe that the Devs lived up to their end by continuing to upgrade and fix their product. While it's still not perfect, nor should it be in EA, it remains a good amount of fun and the trust is there for it to become what the community wants it to be. Now back to sinking some convoys!

It makes me think that a lot of the YT videos out there were ""sponsored"" by the makers because they have clearly cut out the ridiculous amount of micromanagement and clicking that is required to get the most banal things done, which frankly is not enjoyable at all. 
Here are some issues I have with the game in its current state:
1) The combat system is ridiculous - the devs had the opportunity to add some interesting features to the torpedo mechanics here; sadly it's just a click, wait and shoot mechanic, with no thought given to how torpedoes were actually fired; you have no way of knowing what gyro angle you are firing at, so you can't really hope for a 90 degree hit on a target. Another example, there's no option to raise or lower the periscope unless you are in the periscope view, and the second you move away because you have to do something silly like change the colour of the lights, the periscope goes right back up.  
2) The gun is a waste - put your crew on it and they fire at nothing. This needs to be fixed, because you will be going through your ammo quickly and sinking nothing. Don't even bother with manual aim, it's boring and requires no skill.
3) Why all the clicking for basic things? Do I really need to get someone to walk across the entire ship to start the compressor? Surely one of the sailors could do that if I asked him to. Same with the pump, and the lights, and moving food; silly, we don't need to micromanage everything.
4) Why can't I spend more than 15 minutes underwater before discipline drops? I can understand if we are getting depth charged, but it seems like the second I go under for a hydrophone listen my crew turn into a bunch of lazy clowns.
5) The port mechanics are terrible. There's no logic to the supply screen, how much food do I need for how many days? 
6) Why is there no single ship management screen where I can see, for example, the status of my torps, how much ammo is on deck, what systems are running? Instead I need to grab an officer (because sailors are too stupid to open cabinets, obviously) and WALK around the ship clicking on things. 

There are many more things; but for now, save your money. The game has potential, yes. The graphics are pretty, but it's not playable to an enjoyable level in its current state.",1591353800,1591353800,False,231,12,0.831434249877929688,18,True,False,True

NOTE: This game entered early access last August,and given the time and money, it sure is terrible still in 2020. Are these guys like ""we wanna be EA and BETHESDA when we grow up!!"" 
PROS: graphics are decent
CONS:
loading, crew management, research, missions, and management at port...HORRIFIC. The instructions, the little theyre are, might as well be written in a dead language. How do i research, what upgrades to pick, upgrades, ship modifications. WHERE THE F@*K IS IT???? I CANT CHECK RESEARCH BECAUSE ITS HIDDEN WITH JIMMY HOFFA! What upgrades do I get? I dont know, I cant see the tiny fucking microscopic upgrade cogs. and when you maybe try and click on something, the UI is such a piece of shit that after 5 or 20 clicks, you may have got it, may have not. You never know

missions: 
jesus christ these are bad. so bad, Tried repairing a german uboat. Got to it. After 30 minutes of clicking arounnd finally figured it out. Not to mention thew tutorial help you with NOTHING. Then I finally get someone over to the other uboat. I get a countdown timer and it stops. Did it work? did he fix it? did he have the part? NOBODY F&@KING KNOWS!!!!!
then after another 30 minutes, i get to a prompt that asks if I want to use our parts to fix other uboat. I click on 1. nothing. I get a prompt. ""use part to repair"" i click. nothing. I click again. option 2, we dont have time for this. option 1, still clicking. nothing happens. I have the parts. still trying to click and activate the last half of this mission. Nothing. click click nothing. 

in conclusion, this game is a wonky, buggy, slow, unoptimized, unfun, and frustration sim. Its like the old days when arma came out and you turn a helo or a tank and nothing happens, then 20 minutes later it turn and then your game crashes.  I want to play a game, not become a fucking nautical engineer. DO NOT BUY THIS. If you want a slow, buggy, piece of garbage with a UI spock couldnt get to work, just go back to silent hunter. Its old but still more accessible than this garbage. Heres the keys to a space shuttle, have fun. Thats what this must be, and i would have about the same chance getting off the ground in that as i would finishing a basic gameplay mission in this maddening mess.

It is very in-depth which in my opinion is a good thing but as I'm starting out it would be really nice to have a simple tutorial that shows you what you need to know at that point in the game.

I was never any good at the Silent Hunter series. I just couldn't grasp it. However, with Uboat the developers have made the process of commanding a submarine very easy whilst still maintaining an element of realism. At the time of review the game doesn't have a campaign mode that flows from 1939 to 1945 however it does give you different start dates which then have an impact on the difficulty level. The campaign is coming and when it does arrive, boy will it be a good time!

The development team are active within the community itself answering questions, providing helpful tips and generally being great at supporting those who have issues. I've asked numerous questions and each time one of the development team has come back to either just confirm something another player has said or to answer my question in it's entirety. 

It takes a couple of hours to learn how everything works, and understand the mechanics but once you know what you're doing you shortly start racking up the tonnage. That said, don't under estimate the AI. It is vicious and if they get a sniff of you they will prosecute attacks with prejudice, and call in reinforcements for support. 

The game allows you to fight in the 3 major areas of the European theatre of WW2 naval warfare, the Atlantic, North Sea, and the Med. You can also go in to the Baltic although aside from the tutorial i've not spent any time there so I can't tell you how rich the pickings are.

Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone with a passion or an interest in WW2 naval history / combat.",1590843133,1590843133,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
